Kobuk Valley National Park,Traveled to Kobuk Valley National Park by plane. Golden Eagle Outfitters flew us in and landed on the sand dunes in the park. It was amazing that there was life in such a barren areas. Saw bird and animal tracks and several varieties of flowers.,"July 29, 2019",Trip to Alaska,43,,5
Kobuk Valley National Park,"We flew to Kobuk Valley National Park from Bettles Lodge. Our pilot, Mark, was an experienced pilot, but new to the area. He had to find a new spot to land, due to wind conditions. He kept us informed about what he was doing and we felt safe and in good hands. We only had a day trip here, but it was part of a goal to visit as many national parks as we are able to. We really enjoyed the trip, because even getting to and from places above the Arctic Circle involves some stunning scenery from above, in the plane. This was a 4 person plane, and there were 3 of us, plus Mark. Perfect! We got some nice pictures, including some with the signs the visitor center in Bettles lends out for photo ops. It was a rather cold day, but none of us complained!","September 10, 2018",A place of quiet solitude,147,"Wausau, Wisconsin",5
Kobuk Valley National Park,We flew to Kobuk National Park from the Bettles Lodge. We landed on the sand dunes and had lunch and hiked around for a few hours. The sand dunes are awesome and the scenery is beautiful. This was my 59th park out of 60. One more to go. The Bettles lodge was fantastic and their flight seeing trips are the best. It's not cheap but if you want to go you just have to pay. I would recommend this trip to anyone trying to go to all the National parks.,"June 21, 2018",Awesome Park,105,"San Clemente, California",5
Kobuk Valley National Park,"We were at Bettles Lodge and decided to book a bush plane ride with our great pilot Kevin. The scenery over to Kobuk Valley National was pretty neat even though it was a bit foggy. Spits of rain here and there as well. The mountains all around were spectacular and you could see a pretty significant sized Indian Village as well and some moose down below in areas. We also got to stop at Gates of the Artic NP which was very nice and remote as well.Kobuk Valley NP looked quite like the Sahara Desert. There was nothing there except dunes, dunes and more dunes. It really was very different and beautiful in such a remote area. There also was a ravine with a river down below it that was lovely. We were there in June and there were lots of wild flowers -- AK's state flower -- forget me nots and those yellow and purple ones -- forgot their names. It was worthwhile and a good memory. I have some pics I can dig out if anyone is interested.","December 15, 2017",The quietness of Kobuk Valley National Park,2,"port orange,",4
Kobuk Valley National Park,"I visit this park with wife by park visiting flight from Bettles offerred by the Brooks Range Aviation so mainly viewed from airplain.We were so much impressed by the scenery of Alaskan great nature, which differs from the other states in US.It was warm as long as the sun shines when we visited in mid August, however weather changes quickly as clouds flowing and over locations, it requires you to take rain gears and clothes to keep warm.We are also impressed by the Brooks Range's kind help with booking flights between Fairbanks and Bettles, and loding!They have two fancy cabins and we could stay at reasonable price!","August 17, 2017",Challenging but worth visiting!,18,"Kanto, Japan",4
Kobuk Valley National Park,The only way to get there is by Bush plane. There are probably no other humans within 50 to 100 miles. It is a wonder. Sitting on the dunes is a terrific experience.,"July 28, 2017",Beautiful Desolation,13,"Dayton, Ohio",5
