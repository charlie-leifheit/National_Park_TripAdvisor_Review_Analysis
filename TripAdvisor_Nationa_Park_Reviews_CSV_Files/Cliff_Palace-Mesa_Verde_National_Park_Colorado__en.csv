Cliff Palace,"I visited wonders of the World Machu Piccu and Chitzen Itza and more Native American Ruins. I don't know why Mesa Verde is so unknown. I loved it! Due to lack of time, we (of course) took only a Tour for Cliff Palace, the biggest site. I have to admit that the tour was a little woolly, but it is the only chance to walk through Cliff Palace. It was worth it. Get your tickets a day before you want to do the tour (in low season). And travel time in the park itselves is also something to be aware of.... (take at least 45 minutes to drive from the park etrance/ camp site to the ruins.","October 16, 2019",Amazing,18,"Delden, The Netherlands",5

Cliff Palace,"We thought we might get lucky to get afternoon tickets to Cliff Palace after arriving around 2:15 pm on day one. However, we found out they had 2 tickets for 3:00, but they said we would not have enough time to make it back to Cliff Palace. We opted, instead for 11:00 the next morning so as to give us some time to see some other areas of MVNP. As others have said, the hike/walk down to access Cliff Palace isn't that easy. There are uneven steps, some areas with no handrails and some tough areas where any issues with mobility will be tough to traverse. However, to exit the area will be even more difficult and should not be done by anyone with fears of height, ladders, tight quarters through rocky steps, only to have to climb up ladders to get out. Fortunately, my wife and I had not issues with entering or exiting. This tour is well worth the $5 pp charge to get up close and personal with your Park Ranger Guide. It is an amazing site to see up close while only imagining the difficulty those from 700+ years ago had to go through to live in the cliffs. Truly an amazing experience. There is a viewing area just from above the dwellings, as well as, across from the canyon area where you can see it.","October 10, 2019",Missed out on tickets for Day 1 but successful for Day 2,199,New Jersey,5
Cliff Palace,"Great tour, Dave our guide was great especially his song played on his flute near the end. The trail is a little treacherous... my wife freaked a little but made it. If you are not in shape and can't climb very steep paths and numerous ladders better not attempt the tour. Kids that wander could find serious trouble, not for the very young at all. The overlook to the Palace ruins are for you.","October 9, 2019",Outstanding but not for the very young or elderly,69,"Stewartstown, Pennsylvania",5
Cliff Palace,"Unfortunately we did not get tickets to go down to the buildings. TIP - since you have to buy tickets at the park in person, show up in person, at opening time at least 2 days before you want to go down and walk in between the buildings so that you get a ticket. They sell out FAST! Even though we didn't get tickets to go see the buildings up close, the birds eye view provided by the overlook platforms are also stunning. Something you can just stare at for hours and not get tired of it. Extremely beautiful and magical. A must see.","October 8, 2019",Must See!,2,"Austin, Texas",5
Cliff Palace,"We had to show up a day early in order to get tickets for 2PM the next day. It was totally worth it! Only physically fit individuals should go. The climb on uneven steps and a few ladders is equivalent to a 12 story building down then back up again. Two people had to be rescued the day we were there, and our ranger said the bill for a rescue is $15,000, which may not be covered by insurance.","October 7, 2019",Totally Worth It,79,"Fresno, California",5

Cliff Palace,"The 700-year tour was good, but not excellent. The climax is the descent into Cliff Palace. The guide kept saying most people could do it, that he has even had ninety-year olds do it, making people feel guilty if they don’t. THIS IS RECKLESS ADVICE. You go down uneven stairs and paths with no place to hold onto. You walk by ledges with a 7,000 foot drop-off no rails, nothing. If you have a fear of heights DO NOT DO IT. I’m a fit woman of 68 who exercises regularly. When I finished climbing the three final ladders, I thought my heart was going to come out of my chest! And it took me hours to feel normal. Folks, you are at a high elevation and that puts everything in a different situation. Be prudent. ","October 3, 2019",Consider the altitude,154,"New York City, New York",5
Cliff Palace,The tour of the cliff palace was outstanding. The tour guide was informative and patient. It is a pleasure to walk in the cliff dwellings over 700 years old. The restoration was terrific and about 90% is still original. Very excellent. Buy your tickets early in the morning or for the next day at the visitors center.

Cliff Palace,"I didn't have time to take the ranger guided tour that gets you up close to Cliff Palace, but I was able to view it from across the canyon. There is also closer vantage point on the other side of the canyon above the ruins which gives you a pretty decent look. It was built in the 1200s by the Pueblo Indians and had 150 rooms in its prime. It's about an hour and a half drive from Durango. It's a scenic drive with other cliff dwellings to see along the way. For me it was time well spent.","October 2, 2019",Cliff Palace in Mesa Verde Colorado.,0,"Bowling Green, Kentucky",5

Our ranger was great and showed so much patience with too, too many questions. He was unable to finish his presentation. I don’t recall his name, but is from Memphis and is headed to Idaho for his next assignment. I don’t have a suggestion as to a better way, but the large group was slow moving from place to place, further wasting time when we could have been learning. Still, an excellent event.

Cliff Palace,"This was my second visit to Cliff Palace. It is simply stunning.Since this is the park's most iconic structure and tours can be booked two days in advance (but must be booked in person), the tours sell out quickly. Get tickets as soon as you can from the visitors center at the entrance to the park, the mesa top museum, or the Durango Welcome Center. Unless it's a chilly day, morning tours are best since the site is in shade.The tour is about 75 minutes long, including wait time. To get to the dwelling you climb down metal stairs from the north side overlook, then some steep stone stairs through a narrow cut in the rock, then down a paved trail, and up a short ladder. To exit, you hike up a very short trail on the south side, climb two ladders, and then walk uphill back to the parking lot. The trail is listed as strenuous, but as long as you can climb ladders and climb down steep steps (some if which are 10"" or more deep), you'll be fine. This is the biggest collection of cliff dwellings in the park, but you don't get to climb around them at all; the tour just moves along the retaining wall at the front. But it is an amazing place and well worth the $5 ticket price.","September 30, 2019",Stunning!,287,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

This tour is much easier than Long House because there isn’t much distance to cover. However, there are a number of stairs to ascend/descend so you need to be able to navigate those. They allow plenty of time so you won’t feel rushed. The site is beautiful to see. The ranger explains how the ancestral Puebloans managed to live here successfully for about 200 years.

Cliff Palace,"Did the tour today at cliff palace at 2pm. It was absolutely beautiful. Beginning of the tour, guide spent about 25 minutes telling us what we were going to do during the tour. That took forever. And at the end of the tour I felt I knew more about our tour guide and his personal life versus Cliff Palace and it's natives. He didn't really elaborate on facts and culture. He over talked and was very dramatic and consistently talked about his personal experiences. I understand his heart was probably in the right place but honestly my husband and I were bored and spent a majority of the time rolling our eyes. He talked about how he became a park ranger and even said that as a park ranger he could, "" say want he wanted"" on his tours. At the end he went into some emotional speech about going on journeys and how that related to the tour. It was weird and my husband and I and another couple couldn't get up those steps and ladders fast enough. The focus needs to be more on an informational standpoint.Views were great and besides the eh tour we enjoyed the history.","September 11, 2019",Views beautiful..

Cliff Palace,"You should definitely take a tour of one of the main sites whilst in Mesa Verde. We bought tickets for both Cliff Palace and Balcony House from the Durango Visitor Centre but you can only purchase them up to 48 hours in advance. Each tour lasts 1 hour and costs $5. As they are only a 10 min drive apart its easy to do both in a day visit.Whilst Cliff Palace and Balcony House are quite different and Balcony House is more physically exciting to visit, on balance I'd opt to tour Cliff House if I only had time for one. This is more representative of a collective group housing structure and is bigger.In terms of information there is quite a lot of overlap so you need to be prepared for that but you can only visit either structure on a guided tour.","September 9, 2019",Must visit at Mesa Verde,546,"Chichester, United Kingdom",5

I got the last slot so make sure you sign up on recreation.gov as far in advance as you can. Print out your tour confirmation voucher since cell phone coverage is nonexistent in the park.

There were 3 dwellings to tour all lead by a Park Ranger who shared information about the dwellings, construction, culture and answered questions. If you have never had the chance to explore this type of dwelling I would encourage you to do so. It truly is an experience that helped me appreciate the challenges of that era and more importantly helped me appreicate what I have today. As for air conditioning in hot climate, these dwellings were not needing them. The masonary skills awed me considering the tools they had to use and quality of the construction.","September 6, 2019",Amazing review of Ancestral Pueblo history and culture,12,"Kamloops, Canada",5

Cliff Palace,"Thanks to informative reviews on TA, we got our tour tickets at the Durango visitor center, which is worth a visit anyway. Our 11 am tour was totally full, with over 50 people, and the guide said that the earlier tour was not full at all. So if you can get yourself going and get to the park early, it might be worth it to take an earlier tour. But remember, it is a bit of a drive from Durango, and past the park gates, you still have to drive up to the meeting points for these tours. **I cannot stress enough how much water you need to bring. Buy a gallon and keep it in the car and make sure you always have a bottle with you when you are walking around. Dehydration is serious, and if you are new to this area, you aren’t going to be used to drinking as much as you need to out here.

Now, 65, and in relatively good shape, with the thinner air, it was a bit of a challenge. Got through start to finish but needed to rest at the end. If you have any health issues, or have a fear of heights, you may want to question the ticket sellers before you purchase. Hubby and I were glad we did this tour.

It is rated strenuous and you are warned about the ladders, but the uneven stone steps were the worst park - some so tall that I could barely lift my leg high enough to step up. BUT - it was worth every bit of it! I have dreamed of seeing this up close since 3rd or 4th grade. You come away with such a sense of awe - for the structure and especially for the people who engineered it hundreds and hundreds of years ago. It should be on everyone's bucket list!

Then you go up a 10 foot ladder to a flat area for the first part of the talk. You walk around a pretty flat area during the tour. There are some areas that are about 3 ft wide on the edge of the canyon that you have to walk on. When it’s time to ascend out of the canyon you go up a very narrow passage on uneven steps but you have stone walls on both sides to hold onto. Then there are 4 10 ft ladders to climb. There are rock walls surrounding you close which gave me a sense of security. Btw, at the top of each ladder there is a hand rail so you can exit easily. Do it!

I couldn’t believe how amazing the dwellings were. Pictures don’t do it justice.I have a couple of points worth mentioning:1. I would STRONGLY suggest that you take the 9 AM tour. Reason why is that there are no other groups ahead of you and you can view the dwellings easier.2. The tour involves climbing ladders and relatively uneven stairs/surfaces. This is not incredibly difficult work, but if you are in poor health, this tour may not be for you.This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to explore these.

The tours of all of them are described as “strenuous,” and we chose this one because the climbing and small spaces sounded minimal. The ladders you must climb are very sturdy, and on the “hand and toe” trails there is usually something to hold onto. It can be hot and sunny, so bring water and wear a hat.

Yes, water on tour is highly recommended especially on warm days. Cliff Palace is easier physically but still has climbs, Balcony House is more difficult but take your time and you will be fine ( as long as you can climb ladders).

Obviously, there are ladders and uneven paths to deal with but people with reasonable mobility should cope. The only downside was the young lady who was the on site guide.

Cliff Palace,"Cliff Palace is an amazing structure and an impressive construction feat for the ancient people who built it.I took the ranger led tour and it was excellent. I learned a lot and had chances to ask questions, and see up close things you can only see at a distance if you don’t take a tour. However, the tour is a bit strenuous, especially on a hot, sunny day. For this reason, if you have physical limitations, they’ll be amplified by the thin air at this elevation, and you may find dealing with the uneven, sometimes narrow rocky steps to be a challenge. I also recommend against taking small children on this tour.If you can’t take the tour you can still get a look at Cliff Palace from a viewpoint at the beginning point of the tour, just bfore the locked gate.","July 22, 2019",Great ranger tour but not for everyone,610,"DeWitt, New York",5

There is an overlook to view the Cliff Palace but the only way to walk among the dwelling is to take a tour. We bought our tickets at the Mesa Verde Visitor center (at the park entrance). We arrived at the park at noon and the Cliff Palace tours were sold out for the day. We bought tickets for the next day. The Cliff Palace is the largest cliff dwelling in the park. The tour is 1/4 miles long and took about 1 hour. From the Cliff Palace overlook, we walked down some fair deep stairs then an asphalt path to the dwelling. That took about 5 minutes. The ranger was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. We climbed three 8-10 foot ladders in the dwelling. After the tour, we climbed two 10 foot ladders and some rock stairs through a narrow canyon to exit. The Cliff Palace is 23 miles from the Visitor Center (park entrance) and took us about one hour to drive. Be sure to give yourself plenty of travel time in the park. All of the roads are winding.

Cliff Palace,"There is nothing quite like this tour. This is one of the best preserved cliff dwellings and this particular site is the largest. You have to get your timed tour tickets in advance. We had to show up on a Saturday to get tickets for the following day at 2 pm. Give yourself at least an hour from the front gate to drive to the spot where the tour starts, even more time if you are going to stop other places along the way. The trip down the cliff side is not too bad so long as your knees can take rock stairs of various sizes and depth, as they are uneven. When you get to the bottom, you get to sit for awhile while the first presentation is made while you can see the whole ruin in front of you. Then you get to actually walk through the ruin and look into the rooms and down into multiple kivas. The kids liked it and even my 4 year old did not have trouble. The way back up is much tougher. You are effectively scaling back up a cliff using three ladders and stairs carved into crooks and narrow areas between rocks.

Cliff Palace,"This was the second guided tour we took this day, the first being Long House. We are very glad that we did Long House first because that tour is longer and gives you a lot more detail about the sites and their inhabitants. This site is very well preserved and a fine example of a cliff dwelling. The problem we encountered was the group size. The group we were in was at maximum size (45 or so people) and was too large. The ranger began talking before everyone was there to hear him and we missed a lot which wasn't too much of an issue for us because we had heard most of it from the Long House tour. But also it was crowded while our group was there and we couldn't really walk around freely as we had at Long House or Balcony House. We were on the 3:00 tour and looking back to the next group on the 3:30 tour we counted only 14 people. So a word to the wise, if your group looks big ask about the next tour and if it is smaller wait and take that one. The dwelling itself is great and inspiring. To think they could do this without a written language or modern tools is mind boggling. With the site and the ladders you get an Indiana Jones feeling of adventure. Well worth doing but watch your timing. Earlier or later in the day when there are less crowds and sun would be better. And make sure you have appropriate footwear and enough water.","May 28, 2019",Great ruins but beware of crowds,48,Granby,4

Cliff Palace,"We also had hoped to tour the iconic Cliff House, but it was closed due to damage during a rock fall. The park rangers were unsure when it will be opened again. It is possible to see it from a distance from viewing points in the park. You can tour two other areas with advance reservations: the Long House and the Balcony House which are very satisfying. We toured both and both tours were excellent but I would advise just booking one place because there was quite a bit of overlapping information, so our second tour wasn't as interesting and we already had a good idea of living conditions and the architecture of these complexes. However when choosing, keep in mind that the Balcony House involves climbing free standing ladders, squeezing through tight places and walking up a steep rock cliff using chains; its challenging for those with acrophobia. After stern warnings from the park ranger regarding all the possible challenges along the way, everyone was successful getting through the maze and enjoyed the tours The Long House requires less heights but more walking and for me wasn't as dramatic. If you want to tour these two sites, be sure to visit the Mesa Verde's website to understand how to obtain tickets because they are not available on line and only available two days before the touring date.

Cliff Palace,"The Cliff House is one of three cliff dwelling available for ""entrance"" in 2018 via a $5 guided tour with a National Park ranger. Visiting the Cliff House is an amazing experience and I highly recommend for the able-bodied and those not afraid of the one steep-ladder-climb-out. We enjoyed all three entrance tours but found this one to probably be the ""easiest"" in terms of physical challenges.TIPS: - If staying in Cortez, buy tour tickets at the Mesa Verde Visitor Research Center (near the entrance) and only a 10 -15 minute drive away. Upon entrance to the Visitor Center, you'll see a Ranger Info station to the left...but the Tour-purchase area is to the right. (You'll see large screens showing tour time availability and possibly, long lines....this is where you should head to)- If you have time for only one ""entrance"" tour, then choose the Cliff House since it is the easiest in that it has the fewest ladders and is the least physically challenging. NOTE: For optional enjoyment of this National Park, it is wise to ""believe"" the National Park Service descriptions and requirements for these tours.

Some people were from other countries such as Italy, Brazil and Germany. They traveled this far to see this special place.","October 4, 2018",guided tour of ancient dwellings,77,Minnesota,5

Note, if you want to book certain tours in July, book in advance as they sell out and then you are limited to times which may not suit.Having said that we booked onto the Cliff Palace tour from the Tourist Information Centre at the base of the hill before driving up to Mesa Verde and it was a very easy process and only about $10 each instead of $110.00.The tour was interesting, led by a national parks ranger and was really all that we needed. I think it went for about 2 hours tops.","October 3, 2018",Interesting Tour,33,Sydney,4

Cliff Palace,My aunt from Idaho flew me out to her house in Boise. I told her of my lifelong desire to visit the Grand Canyon so she planned a road trip and since she already went to Mesa Verde National Park she wanted me to have the same opportunity. So day one of our adventure was the cliff dwellings. She got me a ticket to go on a guided tour to the Cliff Palace. I had a little anxiety about climbing the ladders but it turned out to be quite easy. To think that people actually built and lived in these dwellings long before the invention of modern tools is beyond belief. I took several pictures while I was there but I have to say that a movie camera may have been the better way to go. This place is huge and vast. I hope that someday I am able to return to visit more dwellings. I would recommend checking out some of the YouTube videos if you plan to visit. There are some really good videos there.,"September 27, 2018",Cliff Palace Pure Awesomeness ,42,"Londonderry, New Hampshire",5
Cliff Palace,"Magnificent Cliff Palace was even more impressive than the photographs. It was the final stop of our very informative and interesting Aramark, 700 years (1/2 day) tour that I had booked over the internet well in advance. This tour was particularly excellent in that, when marvelling at historically more recent Cliff Palace’s architectural features, I was able to readily compare them with the architectural practices that had been carried out by earlier Ancient Pueblo people. Cliff Palace can be seen from a viewing platform that is not far from the carpark but the site can only be visited on a park ranger guided tour. Unless you are on an Aramark 700 years, half day tour, you must stop at the park headquarters, which is at the park entrance and more than 20 miles away, and purchase a $5.00 timed tour ticket for Cliff Palace. Please be aware that getting into and out of the Cliff Palace site involves some steep ladders and stairs. Although a caution sign at the viewing platform states that “Visiting cliff dwellings will involve strenuous hiking and climbing. If you have any health problems do not attempt.”, I felt safe and not overly physically challenged in visiting the Cliff Palace site but readily accept that the steep ladders and stairs used to get into and out of the site may be too much of a challenge for some people. If you are keen to get a very good distant photograph of Cliff Palace (i.e. one with the least shadow), return to the viewing platform in the late afternoon.","September 25, 2018",Magnificent- no photograph can do it justice,140,"Sydney, Australia",5

It's a great place to talk to the park rangers, learn about hidden gems or must see's in the park, see artifacts and watch documentaries about the park and the Puebloans. It's much busier than it's sister park - Canyons of the Ancients National Park nearby. It is impressive area with lots of cliffs to enjoy. There are difficult and easy hikes. We did a guided tour, which we highly recommend you do! You have to buy your tickets at the VC. Make sure you check the availability boards. The guide we had was great. The hike was about 1.5 in with a lot of stairs. So heading back was a bit difficult since we had our mom with us who was older. But for anyone who is very fit and healthy, it'll be breeze. Our tour was about 2 hours. There are some stairs and/or ladders to climb (check the details for each tour before you commit). We did Cliff Palace. It was insightful and fun to enjoy.

The nicest part was she stayed behind me on the trail down while I had a hand clinging onto Hubby’s backpack. It’s a bit steep with cracked and not maintained sections of the paved road. It was worth the hike and entailed climbing up a couple of very strong and wide wooden staircase into the Pueblo and out. The last climb is up a narrow staircase between rock walls. If you’re very wide, I could see getting wedged and stuck. She was informative and the 30 or so of us on the hike asked a lot of good questions. She usually has a group of 50 hikers.

The location of the Cliff Palace, perched under a huge rock overhang, is spectacular. The thought that this complex of buildings is over 800 years old is astounding and it is a wonder as to how and why they were constructed. The ranger was very good, telling us what is, and more importantly, was isn’t known about the people who lived here and why they built it, prodding us to think about these mysteries from both scientific and human perspectives. A very thoughtful experience. There is some climbing to do and some very uneven paths, and it does get very hot down there, so it is best to consider if the trail is suitable for you before starting out.

I’ve visit ancient sites around the world and the USA is lucky to have this site. The sense of history, exotic-cool cache, the craftsmanship...just agog, bowled over, struck dumb and mute by this place. If you want to do the twilight tour it’s NOT booked through NPS! A private company vendor does this. I’d love to come back for star programs. If you can’t hike about a mile at 7k ft elevation, near vertical stairs and ladders, uneven stairs—then sadly you shouldn’t come down.

It was fascinating to see the ruins up close. You do have to climb down a number of uneven steps cut into the rock to get down to the cliff dwellings and to return you must climb up 3 wooden ladders.

I am surprised by how little we know about this people and why they invested so much energy to build these spots and then leave. To access this site you descend over 100 feet down the cliff face via stairs and steps. Uneven. You must have good knees to be able to handle the steep descent. Then you climb back out when the tour is over. You climb out via stairs, steps, and several ladders.Be aware that on this tour you do not actually enter any of the buildings at the site. You stay outside and you are told to not even to touch any of the buildings.

For both this tour and the tour of Balcony House, you need to ensure you are in good physical condition to walk down many uneven steps, navigate around the kivas (large pits in the ground), and then climb out another series of ladders. My wife, myself, and our three boys (ages 8, 10 and 12) loved it.

Our third person was able to go as it was a very small group of only 10 and the ranger took two others who luckily happened to be there telling them they could pay the fee later at the box at entrance walk. One couple said they had booked it the night before on line so maybe they hold out some slots close to the date.I was a little nervous about the tour as we are 73 and 74 but we had no problem and do live at sea level so we just took it slow as I think the elevation was about 7,000 feet.

Our guide was very informative about what they belief took place in the cliff dwellings on a daily basis. It was interesting to learn that they are not quite sure why the people left the dwellings.My wife and oldest daughter are not big on heights. They were a little unsure about how we were getting down and back up from the dwelling. There are metal stairs that take you down and you are surrounded by rocks. On the way up you have to climb 3 about 10 foot ladders. Here to you are surrounded by rocks.

Not only was she knowledgeable about everything, she incorporated a marvelous sense of humor into each situation. I’ve had experiences with tour guides who possessed the personality of a wet sock- but this was not the case at all with Beth. She made us metaphorically put on different types of shoes in order to envision the variety of people that ventured through these beautiful dwellings we call Cliff Palace. The trip was splendid, but a disobedient child tried to pull a fast one; he pulled out a pen and tried to write something on the historic walls- but to no avail. Alas, Beth prevailed victorious and stopped the child in action. To anyone who wants to go on a tour: I suggest going on the tour with Beth; if you don’t, I can guarantee that you wish you did.

Cliff Palace,"One major tip if you want to see any of these major cliff ruins up close. Get to the park early, even before it opens, and get in line to get your tickets for the tours. They fill up fast, and while you can appreciate the cliff dwellings from a distance, it's better up close where you can really see the craftsmanship of these ancient peoples. We took the Cliff Palace tour with a ranger, and learned a ton. What we learned more is that there really is a lot of mystery about these places. The ranger said that they didn't even know the original names of the dwellings. There is a lot to be learned about these places. Some of our guide's comments were acerbic and biting toward those of European descent in our group in terms of Western attitudes and placing Western values on American cultures. Some rightly so. But it was done with a humor and wasn't at all off putting. The rangers are a wealth of information, and it's best to listen. The trek down to Cliff Palace was mainly rock with some flat expanses of trail. Some ladder climbing and rock stairs to get out of the canyon, but nothing too overexerting.

Space is limited, of course, and they book out quickly in the summer. We were extremely fortunate to get it to come together for us and we got the last tour of the day. Our ranger was OUTSTANDING. I tried so hard to remember her name until I could write this review so she'd get credit, but... my weak old brain fails me. Something like Kailey Day or Bell. She was awesome.

It was definitely worth the extra effort so we could book a morning tour (in the shade and pretty cool). We enjoyed the Ranger's talk and learned so much about Mesa Verde and the Cliff Dwellers. The tour was informative and very interesting. The Ranger was interested in all questions from the group and took the time to answer every question without rushing. The drive from the visitor's center to the top is 25 miles and can take 1.25 hours. Plan accordingly so you don't miss your tour. There are 2 restaurants on the way to the top. Both have gift shops.

The short trail down to the ruins is not that strenuous (compared to Balcony House), however there are still a few ladders to climb to get out of the ruins. The Ranger explained the history behind the ancient Pueblo who built these homes. It is hard to imagine that over 800 years ago-100-120 families made this home in rooms that were 6ft x 8ft, climbing to the mesa's top using only shallow hand- and footholds niched into the wall, to farm the top-growing corn and squash. It must have been truly remarkable. The complex is about 150 different rooms, storage chambers with 21 ceremonial kivas.

I really never broke a sweat. The ladders were easy. The final set of ladders up were steep... and I was hugging and puffing... it was not too bad...

We had gone to the visitor's center to purchase tour tickets the night before, which was a good thing because as it is, we were booked on an 11:30 a.m. tour...I do recommend trying to get your tour tickets the day before if you want a morning tour. We aren't the most active and physically fit girls in the world, so we were nervous about the hike down and the climb back up, but it wasn't too bad. The climb down was a little precarious--the cliff steps are kind of narrow, uneven and steep, but it was worth it. The climb back up wasn't bad--even the ladders didn't bother me. They stress that it is very strenuous, but we found it doable. Our tour group was big, probably 50 people or so, so if you want to hear your tour guide and really hear the history, stick close to your guide. If you were on the fringes you couldn't hear a word he said. We loved our tour guide, Doug from Shelby Ohio. He was so knowledgeable and friendly.

We arrived around three o'clock after they stopped selling tour tickets to walk down to the ruins. If we are ever close again, I will definitely do it. With that said, it is worth the drive into the park (it may take about thirty minutes to get there from the park entrance) just to view the ruins from a distance. When you arrive, there is a sign pointing to a meeting location for the guided tours. Go ahead and head down it to reach the overlook.

Cliff Palace,"The extremely-well preserved habitat of Pueblo Indians between 1,200 and 1,300 AD, now called Cliff Palace, is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the Mesa Verde National Park in southwestern Colorado. Built into sandstone near the top of a cliff overlooking a valley and beyond, the palace has dozens of rooms partitioned by thick clay-and-hay bricks. Almost all visitors looked marveled at the one of Pueblo Indians' greatest relics for its location and artistic beauty. At the time of my visit on Dec. 30, 2017, a close-up guided tour of the palace was unavailable probably because the park employees were off work for the holiday break. But a view down from an observation place which is only approximately 100 yards away was more than satisfactory.

How often to you get to turn back the clock and walk where an ancient people did? The whole of it is breath taking. Getting to it, getting out of it can be physically demanding. So, stay hydrated, especially on hot days. Between the altitude and the effort one could become ill. Rein in small children, there are many opportunities for them to hurt themselves. You are allowed to crawl through some tight areas that are simply amazing. One person commented that they had 3 hours to spend and would see the entire park.

There is uneven terrain, some steep steps, and a very steep and narrow passageway through a crevass to exit. However, this is the only pre-Colombian park in the US and definitely worth a visit. Indigenous cultures are explained and respect for nature is evident. Rangers are knowledgeable and friendly. Tour runs about 60-75 minutes.

It was such a big disappointment, which if I did not feel ashamed I would cry. Luckily I noticed a flight of stairs leading down, and following them, we arrived at a terrace, from where we had a perfect view of the Cliff Palace. Probably from our viewpoint we were able to see even more, than if we actually have been there. Following the lucky visitors with my eyes, I was able to walk in my thoughts on the same pass, and even further, where they maybe weren't allowed to get in. Mesa Verde Cliff Palace is a huge dwelling, with 150 rooms and 23 kivas. Approximately 100 people lived here 700 years ago. Before we went to Mesa Verde I learned my lesson, as I usually do.In this case, you don't need a guide, since you roughly know, what are you looking at. That I missed, the close look at the walls, since I wanted to see, an example of the ""chinking."" I smiled at the people standing in the line, who waited for it in order to be allowed to take a look inside a towering four story house. Probably the home of an important person. A lady leaned in in an unfavorable posture, his head within, his more noble body part outside, just discovering the concealed miracles. I missed this, but I amused myself well on the other hand.

I think this is the best time to visit this location because the sun isn't so bright and allows for good photos and it's much more comfortable temperature-wise. The tour guide was very friendly and patient, gave good information about the site and allowed plenty of time for photos and touring the site. There are steps down to the site and several tall wooden ladders to climb back up to the top...would be difficult for small children, but everyone of all ages did fine with them. I'd also suggest grabbing something to eat at the Spruce Tree Terrace, which is close by, before hiking just to tide you over until breakfast...dining times and options are very limited.","September 20, 2017",Must Do Hike,102,,5
Cliff Palace,"Before I get to anything, I would get your tour tickets at LEAST a day earlier than you plan on going! This place books up fast! You can either get tickets at the park gate, or the Welcome Center in Cortez. Also, I would aim for tours before 12pm because it could get pretty hot, especially with all the climbing and such. I would also recommend that time because afternoon tours usually fill up faster because kids like to sleep in :P Anyways, the Cliff Palace tour was a great, generally easy-going tour. Its about 45 minutes to 1 hour long. Firstly you go down some uneven, rocky steps to get down the canyon, then up 1/4 wooden ladders to get to the site.The next part depends on your tour guide, but our tour guide, James, was very helpful! I usually get bored with tours because they drone on and on, but our guide explained how these people might have lived, worked, and communicated with each other and surrounding tribes. He also left a sense of mystery around them because no one knows why these people left the site. He was really informative; people (ranging from teens to elders) would ask him questions and he would give great answers! He’d even have a story or two to go along with his response.Going back, you have to climb the other 3 ladders (all in a row, unfortunately.) The ladders were general easy to climb. I’m not a big fan of highs and I had no problem going up these.Mesa Verde itself was breath taking!! How can you not be fascinated at how they built their civilization INSIDE A FREAKING CLIFF!!!! To me, that’s just amazing!! Its so cool to see these up close; see what each room was meant for, see exactly where they lived, how they were able to live there, and all the wear and tear these ruins have put up over the years. I would be cautious if you are bringing children. You canNOT carry them (unless they are babies in a back/front harness) up the ladders; they have to go by themselves. So, it all depends on how independent your child is. There was only two children there and I would say they were about 8 or 10 years old. Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this site and the cliff palace tour!","September 19, 2017",This was amazing!!!,20,"South Elgin, Illinois",5

Still worth seeing its just with kids its hard to keep them steady in one place when ranger gives 20minute talk and doesnt let you fall a minute behind to take pictures!!!

We were able to visit only two ( 2 ) of four sites because you must be on a Ranger led tour that run a specific times each day and the distance to one of them is over one ( 1 ) hour away from the central museum and the fourth one was closed for safety repairs.

The greatest part of this site is that you can climb into them and walk around. I would recommend anyone who is visiting to give themselves at least three ( 3 ) full days to explore Mesa Verde. There are many hiking trails which we did not have time to discover.","September 10, 2017",Bucket List - Mesa Verde,3,,5

However, when first doing research for things to do on TripAdvisor, it is very easy to be misled that this tour will cost you $150. This $150 tour is through a third party, which I highly recommend against. Once you get inside the park you can pick from your choice of ranger-led tours, all at $5 each. There are also a variety of self-guided tours and sites you can see for free, on your own schedule. I was completely blown away by this park and their extreme respect for the Puebloan people of the past and today! A must see.","September 8, 2017",$5 NOT $150!

It was amazing to see these marvels so close. Learned so much. Yes, there are some stairs but you can take your time if you need. Get your tickets as soon as you can - check out the website for the locations to get them. They were only $5 per person. The tour that is on trip advisor is for an all day guided tour. You can just drive around yourself for the cost of each tour and the cost for each vehicle (around $20).","September 6, 2017",Don't miss this tour,6,Colorado Springs,5

Cliff Palace,"We got tickets for the 11am tour no problem and this was on a Saturday. The tour groups are quite large so if you don't want to be stuck behind a bunch of shuffling people, stick close to the guide and get through the gates and down the stairs quickly. Also the morning tours has the Palace in the shade, which is much cooler and better for photography IMO. In the afternoon you'd melt as it's in full sun. Sadly we had a screaming newborn with us on our tour so we struggled to hear the guide now and then. There was also part of the building where you could look through a window but the sill of this building had gone dark with the grease of tourist hands leaning on it. I think the guides should not let people lean on and touch this.The tour was informative and interesting and the guide answered our questions. There were two native Americans in our group and they were speaking to eachother in their own language, which sounded beautiful. I wonder if they were saying to eachother ""that guide got it wrong, this was the dining room!"" or something :D Highly recommend this tour but go for the early one, then drive straight to Balcony house and do that tour.

There is a Step pathway down to the site but at the end you are required to climb a steep ladder to get out! It is in one way and out another due to the large group sizes. Well worth a visit. Fascinating history. We had an Indian guide who was wonderful and very knowledgeable and friendly. Explained everything well. At the end of tour he played a wooden flute he had made and dedicated the music to the spirits of his people, it was very surreal and brought the place alive for everyone even the next group waiting!!

Cliff Palace,"You could feel the history whilst walking through this special location. We did this as part of the 700 year guide tour that cost about $50 each through the company that runs the site for the NPS. We were under the mistaken impression when booking the campsite that this was the only way you can see the sites but you can book them on the day for an hour ranger tour for $5 each! That said, we enjoyed the tour which lasted nearly 4 hours, was hosted by a lovely lady and we were driven around the top of the Mesa looking at the views.I would highly recommend this, the cloning to and fro is strenuous as not suitable for the very young or infirm.","August 17, 2017","Wow, what a special place",87,"Aldington, United Kingdom",5

Cliff Palace,"We were staying in Durango, so I drove over to the Visitor's Center early one morning to buy our tickets to Cliff Palace two days in advance. I don't know whether it was necessary, but I was glad I did because we did not need to stand in line and worry about which tour we would get. If you have the America the Beautiful annual pass, you will save on your entrance fee, but still need to purchase the tour separately.We were only spending one day at Mesa Verde, so we chose to only get the guided tour to Cliff Palace, and to skip the other guided tours so that we could explore other areas of the park on our own. I was worried about the climbing, which is why we chose the Cliff Palace tour because the ladders and stairs are much less rigorous than the other tour offerings. The tour was crowded (in July), but the Ranger did a great job of explaining the history, and also of explaining past (not so great) efforts at preservation, and how the park's preservation efforts have improved with better understanding. The views are spectacular. There were many people of all ages, from babies to seniors, on our tour. We went early to avoid the worst of the heat.","August 15, 2017",Worth the tour; the climbing was not bad; book early,9,"Tucson, Arizona",4
Cliff Palace,"Since this is the park's most iconic structure and tours can be booked two days in advance, the tours sell out quickly. Get tickets as soon as you can from the visitors center at the entrance to the park, the mesa top museum, or the Colorado Welcome Center in Cortez. Morning tours are best since the site is in shade. The tour is about 90 minutes long, including wait time. To get to the dwelling you climb down metal stairs from the north side overlook, then some steep stone stairs through a narrow cut in the rock, then down a paved trail, and up a short ladder. To exit, you hike up a very short trail on the south side and climb two ladders. You exit on the south side of the parking lot. The trail is listed as strenuous, but as long as you can climb ladders and climb down steep steps (some if which are 10"" or more deep), you'll be fine. This is the biggest collection of cliff dwellings in the park, but you don't get to climb around them at all; the tour just moves along the retaining wall at the front. But it is an amazing place and well worth the $5 ticket price.","August 14, 2017","Iconic site, so book early!",287,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

Be sure to get tickets as soon as you arrive at park - we were there at 8:30am and the earliest tour was 1:30pm... until a 10:30am tour popped up just as we were about to purchase. The tour is labeled as 'strenuous', but I think that's excessive. Going to the site you go down metal stairs, walk on a paved path, then up one ladder (which is on an angle and easier to climb than a ladder in your garage). Exciting requires you to go up small original stairs in the rock, then a few more ladders. You might get breathless on the ladders, but the line of people exciting moves slowly, so just take your time. The woman behind me was about 70 years old and did fine!!! Our ranger who led the tour was incredibly knowledgeable and a great story teller. He happily answered and encouraged questions.

I did not think that it was... definitely doable and I am very out of shape. There are a few ladders and some stairs upon exit that will leave you winded, but if you can handle those 5 minutes you have nothing to worry about; it is definitely worth it!

Cliff Palace,"WOW! No other words to describe this incredible piece of history! This is a range lead tour and tickets must be purchased at the Visitor's Center. We purchased our tickets a couple of days before we intended to tour the park, so we could guarantee to have tickets for the time we wanted to do the tour. Each ticket is $5 per adult, and SO worth it to get a hands on tour of the Palace. It blows my mind after seeing the land layout, how the Anasazi built homes in the rock and lived in this very primitive area. They were farmers, so they not only lived in the rock towns, but also climbed up and our of the canyons to their farm grounds on the top of the mesa. What an incredible group of people they were! The staff who run this park are doing a great job of preserving the area to remain as ""accurate"" as possible. Our ranger, Melissa, was very informative and knowledgeable in the history of the area and of the people who used to live here. As a history teacher, I would consider a field trip for my students if we had enough time to make the trip! We will be making this trip again sometime as a family though!","August 7, 2017",Wow!!,18,"Colby, Kansas",5
Cliff Palace,"Cliff palace is the largest dwelling in the park. It's partially restored and rubble cleared for visitors. Like the other dwellings, paths have been added but it's still a moderately strenuous walk at 7000+ feet of altitude and you must be able to climb ladders. This dwelling was home to the ""ancestral puebloans"" who lived in this area and was constructed starting in the 12th century and probably abandoned by the 14th. It has a large number of Kivas, ceremonial rooms, and was probably a social center of the area rather than for just its residents.The entire trip is probably a half mile with about a 100 foot change in altitude. It's (usually) hot and dry so be sure to pack water (and only water) in with you on the trip. I'd classify this as ""moderately strenuous"".Most definitely recommended.","August 4, 2017","The largest of the dwellings in the park, my choice if you only have time for one.",21,"Denver, Colorado",5
Cliff Palace,"I took the Cliff Palace ranger lead tour. Tickets are $5 for specific time, purchase at the visitors center. I would say this is a moderate hike down, with some medium sized ladders to climb. One thing to consider is the 8,000+ foot elevation. If you have health issues better to be safe than sorry. If you believe the ladder climbing is not for you, there is a sample ladder with a few rungs to see if you feel comfortable climbing the ladders at the visitors center where you purchase tickets You can bring water, but unless you have a medical condition so other foods, drinks or candy is allowed. The Cliff Palace is an amazing experience and well worth the hike. The steepest portion is on the way out. Its is amazing people lived in this structure 800 years ago. The tour is about 1 hr and I would say moderate difficulty.","August 3, 2017",Cliff Palace,141,Orange County,5

My kids range from 5 to 14 and it wasn't difficult for them. There isn't a lot of walking to do on this tour, but you have to climb down and up a ladder. The rangers are so knowledgeable. It was so interesting to listen to the tour and see these amazing structures up close. My big advice would be not to go when it's so hot. This was part of a larger trip for us so we didn't have a choice. We picked the 6pm tour, so it was a little more bearable then.

This was really a non-issue as the ladders are almost surrounded by rock, giving a sense of being semi-enclosed, which was reassuring. Wear decent shoes (no flip flops) and take water. Some of the stairs going down are a bit steep but not a problem if you are in decent shape.Our guide (Mati) was fantastic, combining information and humor in a fantastic way. The ruins are in excellent condition, and it is inspiring to see them up close.Keep in mind that tickets cannot be bought at the Cliff Palace site. You can buy them at the park's visitor center (about 1 hour's drive from the site) or in Cortez at the Colorado Welcome Center.

Yes, they tell you there are 3 - 8-10' ladders to climb and at a 100' incline, but after you see the site you may have second thoughts. From the meeting point with the park ranger it is a loooong way down to the walkway leading to Cliff House, then after you are down there (with no way out but to climb the ladders) you begin the tour. Oh I'm sure it's incredible but my brain won out over my heart...know I could have done it, but at 67 I know I would have been beat up and the day was still young!

I would advise not taking small children on this trip - they will get bored and you are quite high up with cliff drops.

Cliff Palace,"This National Park is truly incredible. Mesa Verde wasn't even on our radar until someone mentioned what an incredible trip their family had during a recent visit. Cliff Palace truly looks like something out of Indiana Jones. We booked far in advance for the Twilight Tour and it was WELL worth a little extra planning. It is such a peaceful and beautiful setting regardless, but when there are not as many people (and the temps are a little cooler) it is even more special. From what I understand, the tickets for the Twilight Tour book up fairly quickly so you will want to reserve them well in advance for your trip. As for other aspects of the park, the restaurant was surprisingly terrific for a national park! The rattlesnake sausage was something fun for the family and the service was great. The rooms provided an extremely beautiful evening with amazing stargazing! I highly recommend putting Mesa Verde on your list of must sees!","July 18, 2017",Stunning!,22,"Fairfax, Virginia",5

Cliff Palace,"My husband, myself, and our 21-month-old daughter visited the Cliff Palace a few weeks ago. We made sure to buy our tickets the night before the tour so that we were assured to get a tour at the right time. The early tour we went on (9:30am) was perfect - early enough in the day that the heat had not yet set in and THE ENTIRE CLIFF PALACE WAS SHADED. This ensured that not only we were out of the sun, but the pictures we took were all balanced with lighting. Definitely doable with a little one as long as you plan ahead. If you have a hiking backpack carrier or a sling, it is doable to bring a toddler or even infant, even with the few ladders that you have to climb. They have done a good job making them very stable and drilled into the rock. I don't like climbing ladders and I didn't even hesitate with the nice wide ones that were constructed for the tour. One last note - keep in mind that the drive into the park to the dwellings is about an hour in length.

Cliff Palace,"My husband and son found it in their hearts to invite me to join for part of their four week roadtrip, and I was there for the best part! I'm Mexican so I was not educated on the pueblo culture, including the cliff dwellings. I loved the national park, I wanted to hug every park ranger because they were so good at what they do, but this is not for the faint of heart, lemme explain. 1. Elevation and heat: this was challenging for a family of three from Seattle. We're at sea level and the weather never gets that hot. Be aware and prepare yourself for this because of what I will explain next. 2. Physical demands: we went on two tours only, but for both we had to climb ladders(10 and 30 feet), go up and down steps, crawl through holes and just be very close to cliffs in general. Take a look at the photos and you'll get what I mean. 3. Tour tickets: we were very lucky that our fabulous airbnb host offered to buy our tickets because we were winging it all the time on this roadtrip. Tickets go on sale 2 days before the tour date, I highly recommend that you're prepared. 4. Fry bread: a word of caution, there is a small section of the park where members of local tribes offer delicious yet addicting fry bread. We made the mistake of offering to son of ours and he demanded this treat everywhere he went for the next two weeks. Absolutely worth all the time and suffering in the Colorado heat.

Cliff Palace,"The pueblo carvings in Mesa Verde are amazing and incredible. The tour is a must in order to go down into the park and see the carved villages from up close. There are some steep short up and down climbs, but otherwise it's an easy tour. Our ranger (sorry, cannot remember his name, long white ponytail, a retired English/History teacher) was super informative in all areas dealing with the history and the carvings, and very solicitous about our drinking enough water on that very hot day. Highly recommended!","July 9, 2017",Amazing historical phenomenon,26,Rehovot,5

Cliff Palace,"The Cliff Palace is one of the largest cliff dwellings. It has been restored, and in many areas, I thought that the original looked better than the restoration, in other words, I was surprised at how good a job the Anasazi had done in making homes that have held up to the elements and the passing of hundreds of years. From the top of the cliff, I couldn't imagine how the Anasazi had gotten down to the cliff dwelling, so I was glad that I got to go on a tour and find trails to the cliff dwelling, and they weren't all that difficult.","June 29, 2017",Loved the tour,0,"Crete, Nebraska",5
Cliff Palace,"The ancestral early Pueblo peoples turned an arid area into a livable and thriving community built by hand. The Navajo name for these people is Anasazi, from reading this is not a desirable name due to its probable meaning of ""ancient enemies."" It is fascinating to visit but to do a guided tour to the ruins requires a fairly enduring hike with lots of climbing and would be too strenuous for me to do. Good view from the overlook.

Your ticket into the park is good for 7 days. We stayed in Durango for 5 days and in hind sight would have bought our tickets for the following day the evening before. Even if you get to the visitor's center at 7:30 AM the early tours are gone. For example, we arrived at 7:45 and got a tour at 12 and 2 that afternoon.

Seriously, the photos do not do them justice. The hike down to Cliff Palace is short and easy, and climbing up the ladder is also easy. The ladder is nestled between the rocks, so you never feel like you might fall. We arrived late Friday afternoon, and bought our tickets Saturday, 9:00 AM at the museum. Consequently, the first available time was 1:30 PM. I recommend buying your tickets at the Visitors Center upon arrival. ","June 19, 2017",Amazing and beautiful,12,"Peoria, Illinois",5

Cliff Palace,"Wow, what an incredible historic site. So very glad we could fit a visit to Mesa Verde into our itinerary. You have to buy the tour tickets for Cliff Palace at the visitor centre and they are very popular - we arrived at 10am and first tour wasn't available until 1pm. Plenty of time for us to take a self driven tour of the pit house/sun temple area and have a picnic lunch near the Cliff Palace. While the experience of walking (climbing)down into the cliff palace and being so close to it was amazing we were not very happy with our ranger tour. Our ranger was more interested in giving 'ice breaker' style conversation then passing on knowledge of the Ancient Pueblo people. A more experienced ranger would have made this trip better. We also had a 'junior ranger' appointed to ensure that people didn't lean or sit on the original walls and this lady (who was not very junior at all) took her job so very seriously!!! Amusing for some but annoying for others. The path to get to Cliff House is very narrow and consists mainly of steep steps, then one ladder to climb up to the first stop. Getting out again is a narrow climb mostly on short ladders. There were all ages on the tour, you would need to keep a close eye on young kids due to the drop off which is not barricaded.","June 17, 2017",Unique place to visit,6,,4
Cliff Palace,"The largest known cliff dwelling in North America, and you can tour it with a park ranger for $5. It is some work -- there are four ladders of 8-10 feet in length, and some 120 stairs.

The descent was steep but had stairs and handrails, things the ancients didn't have.Be sure to drink plenty of water and wear appropriate clothing. I saw people without water and trying to scale sandstone boulders in flip flops. Don't be that guy or gal.Also, don't be the one who leans on a wall that was fine for 700 yrs...until it met you.Diane was great with her history and science explanations.

The tour of Cliff Palace does involve some steep stairs both up and down, but if you take your time I'm sure even an out of shape person can handle it. (I am not super fit and I did just fine!).

Was warm in the sun so be sure to take plain water (but no food, gum, nor flavored water on the hike because it attracts rodents to the ruins). Tour takes an hour. There is a ten foot ladder to climb out at the end. There are also about 130 stone steps to walk into the ruins that are a bit uneven. You have to purchase tickets at the park so get there early (you can purchase for the next day or two if you are visiting Mesa Verde more than one day). Also give yourself a good hour from the entrance of the park to the Cliff Palace tour location. The roads are curvey and the speed limit is slow. ","June 9, 2017",Wow!

The kids enjoyed it...in fact, they liked it better than our visit to the Grand Canyon. The ladders were 8-10 feet, very do-able even for my fear of heights. I did see some older people struggle on the tour, but we all made it in and out safely. Be prepared to descend 64 steps and a ladder.

While waiting for our ranger to start the tour, we watched a massive group of folks on the tour before us leave the Cliff Palace. Most Cliff Palace Tours are reserved at the visitor's center when you arrive at Mesa Verde and are much larger. The online reservation tour was much smaller (15 people max) and had amazing light for the photographers in the group. It's the last tour of Cliff Palace for the day, and we were driving out of the park at sunset, with barely anyone left in the park.

I do have a fear of heights so unfortunately could not go on the Balcony house tour but my kids and husband said it was fantastic. Even my husband said the ladder was a bit scary, I believe it's something like 30 feet to climb with a long drop off in back of you. Totally safe though. They will tell you at the beginning of the tour, do not take this tour if you have a fear of heights. Cliff Palace was fantastic too and I could manage that one.

It also was nice because they did not charge an entrance fee due to most sites not being open. But we did get many photo ops from the overlooks above.

Cliff Palace,"We visited this cliff dwelling while staying at the Mesa Verde park. We purchased tickets for the tour for myself, my husband, and my 10-year-old son, although since we had a dog with us, my husband went on a tour by himself so we could take turns taking care of our dog. We all really enjoyed the tour (although my son was disappointed we couldn't actually enter the dwellings). It was a bit daunting at the start because the tour guide told us horror stories of people with medical conditions who went on the tour and then couldn't make it and had to be airlifted out, and he practically begged us to consider whether we were physically capable. The tour is a bit physically demanding (there are stone steps to climb down and up, there are ladders to go up, you have to basically hike into the canyon and then back out again), but it wasn't as bad as the tour guide made it sound at the beginning. It was fascinating getting into the canyon and seeing the dwellings up close.","February 19, 2017",Absolutely Amazing,35,"Puyallup, Washington",5
Cliff Palace,"Mesa Verde National Park protects a large area containing ancient cliff dwelling ruins in southwest Colorado. The structures are beautifully preserved and amazing to behold. Cliff Palace is the largest of these structures and a must-see attraction at this park. It's visible from several viewpoints on the scenic roads in the park. It is also accessible via tour during the season. Unfortunately we were there in November, so there were no tours available.In all, I consider Mesa Verde one of the United States's must see locations. It's difficult to describe just how beautiful the scenery in the park is, and just how impressive the ancient structures are. The park has a typical 25 dollar per vehicle National Park entrance fee, but this is absolutely worth it for all the amazing sights you can see in the park.","January 22, 2017",Absolutely incredible!,181,"River Ridge, Louisiana",5
Cliff Palace,"One can see Cliff Palace, Mesa Verde’s largest cliff dwelling, from an observation platform above, but it is even better to take a guided tour to get up close. Our guide was a young ranger who was informative and enthusiastic and a major reason why the tour was so enjoyable. The one-hour tour required descending uneven steps, walking one-fourth mile, and climbing four 10-foot ladders. Since the tour is not overly demanding, it is understandable that this is the most popular ranger-led tour. The tour is a must when visiting Mesa Verde and is certainly worth $4.00 ($5.00 in 2017). Note that Cliff Palace closes for the season earlier than Balcony House: plan accordingly. We were lucky to take the Cliff Palace tour on the last day of the season, September 25.","January 20, 2017",Great tour,107,Wisconsin,5

What made it really special for me was the really thoughtful and informative commentary by the ranger, a retired schoolteacher with a passion for education. He brought the site to life, putting life here into context and helping visitors to understand what life must have been like for the original dwellers, and I learnt a great deal from his talk.

Cliff Palace,Our family visited Mesa Verde National Park recently but we were unable to tour Cliff Palace. Tours were stopped on 9/26 for preservation work. I assume it will reopen in the spring but the National Park Service website does not say one way or another. You are still able to go to the Cliff Palace Overlook which is found in the Chapin Mesa section of the park down the Cliff Palace Loop Road. The Loop Road closes in the winter. It is a 23 mile drive from the visitor center and can take an hour to get to. The overlook is a very short walk from the parking lot down a paved path. It gives excellent views of the ruins and should not be missed. You can also see Cliff Palace from across the canyon while on the Mesa Top Loop Road.Cliff Palace is the largest of the cliff dwellings found in the park. The NPS website describes the tour as one hour in length and that it involves climbing 5 different ladders and 1/4 mile of walking.

Cliff Palace,My husband and I took the 700 year tour and highly recommend! Touring Mesa Verde National Park and learning about the ancestral puebloan people and their cliff dwellings was indeed fascinating. One of the biggest mysteries is why they moved from their home.

We were led by a ranger who spoke to us at a few junctures along the path, and discussed what we were looking at, people living in a cliff basically. The Anasazi — or ‘Ancestral Puebloans’ if you want to be politically correct — were thought to live here around 1200AD, and it’s assumed to be the largest cliff dwelling in the United States. It was a bit disappointing if totally reasonable to discover that it was mostly restored by early NPS employees — I guess the alternative of some random stones and your “imagination” is no longer enough. Getting out was simple enough, and the tour has to come highly recommended.","October 14, 2016",The only way to see Cliff Palace,152,"Cork, Ireland",5

It was mesmerizing, standing there, up close to these homes made of soil hundreds of years ago. The draw was the admiration of the ones that built, climbed and lived in this style of home everyday.

Cliff Palace,"The park offers a ranger guided tour of four of its cliff dwellings. We chose Cliff Palace as it is the Park's largest and we didn't have to crawl through a tunnel like the tour for the Balcony house (though we did hear from friends that tunnel wasn't a concern). We loved the Cliff Palace tour. First we met our guide (for the group) and walked down mostly stone steps to an area to wait until the tour group in front of us was finished (it was a busy day). This ""waiting area"" did have at least one area with some ruins so we couldn't touch them. After the group in front of us left the dwelling, we got to walk down to the dwelling and walk in front of the structures. We did get to look into one where we could see a painting on the wall. It was interesting that this site was a bit different in that it had more Kivas (communal areas) than other dwellings. A big highlight for our tour was that our guide was a Native American. He had his carved flute with him and played a song after the tour was over and before we climbed the steps and ladders to get back to the top of the cliff wall. It was a bit surreal to be in front of this ancient site and hear this music. It was a special treat but I wouldn't expect that all ranger guides can or will do this.

I finally got the chance on a road trip with my daughter, and I enjoyed every minute of Mesa Verde National Park and of the Cliff Palace tour. We toured the Cliff Palace as part of the 700-Year Tour, and I really enjoyed the driving approach to the Cliff Palace, because there are great pull-outs so you can see not only the Cliff Palace but also other cliff dwellings near it. All those views really whetted my appetite to arrive at the Cliff Palace. Our ranger was great, and the tour was fun and interesting. The ladders were not anything to worry about, although we did get rained on at the end of our tour, and climbing back out of the Cliff Palace in the pouring rain (and hail) made it more exciting and a little slippery.","August 29, 2016",A bucket list experience,22,"Island of Hawaii, Hawaii",5

Cliff Palace,"When we visited the temp was over 100 degrees and I'm not what you would call a hiker. In fact, I prefer to drive to the park two blocks away. I also don't care for heights. So, I was concerned by all the various warnings about the stairs and the ladder to reach and leave the site.Don't worry - it's really not that bad!The stairs down to the site were no worse than stairs going down anywhere. So if you can do stairs, you are fine. As for the ladder to get out, it's true that it's a ladder, but it is in sections so you aren't on one giant ladder. Also, it's built into the rocks, so you don't feel exposed and up high. The site is amazing and I really appreciated that they take groups in and out so there are actually moments when you can take photographs with no people in the site. One of a kind place - take the time to do it!","August 28, 2016",Not as hard to climb in and out as they make it sound,79,"San Jose, California",5
Cliff Palace,"I recently went on the Cliff Palace guided tour at Mesa Verde National Park. It resulted in incredible views. I would definitely go on this tour again, but perhaps earlier in the day to avoid the hot afternoon sun and also the crowds. The drive throughout the park has so many stop-offs for scenic canyon views and other ancient dwellings. The half day I spent in the park was not long enough, I would allow for a full day to take in more of the stop-offs and also participate in the other guided tour (Balcony House).","August 28, 2016",Great Scenic Tour - Awesome Pictures,11,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",4

If you don't have water make sure you get some before the hike. It gets hot. I'm really glad we had the tour guide we had, he had personal background about the park and was super nice. The hike was not bad my 7 year old nephew had no problems. The older people did fine too we took breaks however, and if you are a flat lander I would not try this the first day at altitude. It was truly one of the most amazing things I have ever seen.","August 24, 2016",Glad to have Ranger Dave for the tour.,17,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",5

At the kiva where the ranger talks go to the opening at the back of the kiva and stick your head through it and look up to see paintings in the sandstone. That was cool.

The walk down doesn't look terrifying but the ladder out of it does. The view is beautiful though and we just lost out on $16. No biggie. If you are strapped for time though this takes a huge chunk of your day. It takes about an hour to get to the palace, the tour is an hour and then the drive back.

He was so knowledgable and passionate about the site and the park and he really brought this area to life and made the tour extra interesting. Very well done Spencer from me and my family. Great job!

I am a senior who doesn't hike much any more, but I made the short trip down the uneven stone steps and back up the three ladders. Yes, I huffed and puffed. The tour is very controlled and mostly involves sitting and listening/looking, but what amazing sight and stories. Just to be surrounded by these buildings from ancient history was worth the three days it took to drive there.

Cliff Palace,"Even though I am afraid of heights and driving on mountain roads (even as a passenger) I'm glad I didn't chicken out and skip this amazing place. Up until a few minutes before going on the Cliff Palace tour I wasn't sure I was going to do it. I really wanted to but was afraid since we had driven around the park and stopped at a number of places and this adventure seemed pretty scary to me. I also wasn't sure I was going to be able to climb up and down the ladder (I was a bit reassured when I found out that you don't climb DOWN any ladders - only up). Not that I couldn't do it physically but mentally. But I was also a bit more freaked out when I found out that there were 4 ladders to climb - I thought there would only be one. At the place you purchase your tickets there are ladders like the ones you will climb so you can get a better idea of whether or not you could do it. I admit that I was scared throughout the tour (for myself and for my two kids even though they are teens). I can't feel comfortable walking on a path where you could step over too far and fall off of a cliff. But as my husband pointed out - ""how many times have you fallen off of a sidewalk?"". The stone steps going up and down were more intense than I thought they would be. Not difficult physically but for one scared of heights and worried about falling off a cliff they didn't seem all that safe to me (but of course they must be b/c they wouldn't be doing so many tours if people were falling off the cliff all the time!) At the top of the wooden ladders there are metal grab bars which made me feel better about up and getting off of the ladder once I reached the top. It was incredible to be so close to these ancient houses built into a cliff. I'm so glad I didn't back out of this tour.The tour is $4 per person - and lasts about an hour. You can buy tickets 2 days in advance but since we only arrived in town the night before we were unable to do it until the morning we visited the park. Even though we arrived around 7:45AM (it opened at 7:30) all the morning tour slots were booked. We were able to get a tour at 1:30 which allowed us ample time to tour the rest of the park, have a picnic lunch and visit the great little museum and see a film on the Mesa Verdeans.We had a great guide named David Night Eagle. Would I do this tour again - probably not b/c it was really intense for me with my fear of heights but I would definitely recommend this to others. I'd not want to take kids with me younger than a teenager.

Cliff Palace,"The Cliff Palace is quite a sight to behold and I highly recommend taking the ranger guided tour that is offered for $4.00 a person. We purchased our tickets at the main visitor's center before you actually enter the park. You can see this dwelling from the top at the lookout point, but it is so much better to go down to it if you are physically able. There are a lot of uneven stone steps to descend into the dwelling area and of course it is also very steep coming back up. The way out has some tight twists and turns on steep steps and there are several short ladders to climb. I am 61 and was a bit worried about it, but gave it a go and made it, albeit totally out of breath once I reached the top! While down in the dwelling area the ranger told us a lot of interesting information about the area and we were able to walk around a bit and look down into a kiva and in some of the various buildings under the ranger's guidance and watchful eye. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes, cool clothes, a hat and bring plenty of water in a small backpack so that your hands will be free to climb ladders and hold hand rails.","July 29, 2016",Spectacular!,13,"Woodway, Texas",5

Our tour was at 3:30 and a large portion of it was in the sun although the tour leader had us congregate near the beginning in the shade at an observation point to give us some of the information. Although there are a few ladders to climb, they are a lot easier than the 32-foot ladder at Balcony House. Yet they might be a bit strenuous for some people.

He was fantastic and I would highly recommend taking any tour he leads. We had 1 1/2 hours in the site and had full run of the area - truly enjoyed the historical discussions from our Ranger as well as the spiritual feelings imparted by him. This is a tour that has to be booked well in advance and more expensive than the typical park tours. It cost $20 per person instead of $4 but we had 12 people and 1 1/2 hours instead of 50-60 people on the standard tour that last 1 hour including hiking down and back up.This tour and our Ranger were the highlights of our three days in the Park.,"July 28, 2016",Sunset Photography Tour,64,"San Antonio, Texas",5

Cliff Palace,We purchased our tour tickets in the morning at the visitor center as we were entering the park. Our tour was at 5pm so we spent the day exploring the park and visiting other ruins. We all agreed the park ranger who was our guide had the most annoying squeaky voice ever and seemed very uncomfortable talking to a large group. The tour seemed to be aimed at children more than adults and at times we felt like we were on a school field trip. We were fortunate to be at the front of the line since entering the ruins requires descending some steep uneven stairs and there were some elderly people and out of shape people in our group who struggled to make it down. Much of the tour time was spent waiting for everyone to make it down the steps. The exit was even more strenuous - climbing stairs and a couple of ladders - we left first so not sure how some people made it out.

If you've hiked or have gone on a uphill walk, you'll be fine. The ladders on this tour are a breeze. The tour guide does not give you time to look around.

Cliff Palace,"Cliff Palace is the largest and easiest of the cliff dwellings to get to. To get access to this site, you must buy a ranger-led tour from the Mesa Verde Visitor Center located at the park entrance. Tickets for each tour are $4 and, during the busy tourist season, they can sell out. This is a very large dwelling; according to our guide, Cliff Palace has over 150 individual rooms and more than 20 kivas (rooms for religious rituals). The hike to the Cliff Palace dwelling is not very long, but the visitor center does label it as ""strenuous”, probably because of the ladder and stairway climbing. Climbing is required to get the most from your visit, but there are by-pass walkways that will accommodate strollers and wheelchairs.

Cliff Palace,"Cliff Palace is undeniably the premier site for visitors to Mesa Verde National Park. I say that because it is the most accessible (my opinion) and truly a remarkable window into our southwestern Native American past. Balcony House is also a must see for the physically fit but Cliff Palace remains our favorite. Here are a couple of tips to follow: * Get tour ticket(s). The Park Service has so regulated these sites that you must now get a ticket and join a tour. And get it early. No capability to order on-line, you must go to the Visitor Center (near entrance) or Museum (up top) and hope for the best. * Be prepared for hiking. The 1 hour tour can get hot depending on the time of year and day. This is a somewhat strenuous hike. Some elevation gain required on the way out; likewise ladders and narrow steps. Know your (and your family's) limitations. * Gas-up before you go up. No services that I saw on top of the mesa. We probably drove 50 miles on our visit.* Pack a lunch. PicNic sites are available so save a buck and pack a lunch ... especially if you are traveling with kids. There is a cafe' if you prefer.If you have the entire day be certain to visit Weatherill Mesa. Cliff dwelling sites here are self guided but it is a drive. Mesa top ruins are also interesting but not as dramatic as the cliff dwellings. And be advised that Spruce Tree House is closed for up-close inspection. Too bad but the Park Service is very risk adverse these days.","July 17, 2016",Outstanding archeology but buy a ticket to see it up close,27,"Sun City, Arizona",4

Cliff Palace,This is truly an amazing sight to behold. The amount of work to get this built with limited engineering knowledge is awe inspiring. You MUST get tickets for this at visitor center. Cost is only $4! They sell out FAST. The tour leaves every half hour. Mornings are the best because you are out of the sun. If going you have to remember that you are at 7000' up and it's hot. Drink lots of water and bring it with you on the tour. If your in average physical shape you'll be fine. But I have to say that if your out of shape and not use to the elevation then you may have trouble. You must climb 3 ladders and a set of uneven step stairs to get out. ,"July 14, 2016",Amazing,6,,5

We drove through the park,took a hike, and snapped pictures of the ruins. It's amazing that you can see Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico from your vehicle as you ascend and descend the Mesa. An ideal trip would be to arrive a day early purchase your tickets, spend the night in the park and go on the Ranger Guided tours. If you choose to go on the tours, make sure you are in good physical condition and acclimated to the elevation. There is up to 100 ft of ladder climbing and up to 1 mile hike to get to some of the ruins. Well worth the effort if you are able. ","July 13, 2016",More than I expected!,4,"Palestine, Texas",5

Cliff Palace,"In looking at other TripAdvisor reviews, here are my primary points. In the summertime, arrive early, like when they open, if you want to do one of the ranger led tours of Cliff Palace, Balcony House or Long House. Spruce House is closed for tours. The tours sell out fast and cost $4 per person, a very reasonable price for a one hour tour. (Cliff Palace). My husband and I arrived at 9:15 and we went immediately to the Visitor Center, which is right off the main highway, even before you pay to get into Mesa Verde. There was one ticket for the 12:30 tour. We took it as my husband passed on the experience. I have been wanting to do this tour for a long time. My husband got the better end of the deal. We went to the onsite cafeteria for lunch at 11:30 (it's next to the Visitor Center by the restrooms and gift shop), then drove to the Cliff House overlook area where the tour group was meeting. We had a young lady who was nice, but so unhelpful. Very irritating voice. She talked to us like we were elementary school kids and the information she shared was nothing about the history of the Pueblo people. It was silly stuff, some of it she just made up as a story since no one knows for sure how they lived there. It was a hot day, in the 90's. If you do this tour, do it before 2:00. It is mostly sunny on Cliff Palace in afternoon. Of the three living sites to tour, this one is the least strenuous. I am in very good physical condition and I had to be very careful going down, climbing the first and only ladder to get to Cliff Palace was no big deal. The bigger challenge was climbing out of there. Several ladders and lots of narrow, steep stairs. Anyone with any kind of health problem such as being over-weight or heart problems, breathing problems, vertigo, etc., should not do this tour. Honestly, I was shocked by some of the people on the tour and hoped they would get back to the top without any contraindications. Would I do this tour again? Never! The view from the viewing platform suffices. My husband is overweight and has a history of Afib. I was so grateful he did not try to do the tour. And, the most aggravating is that this tour should only take 30 minutes. The Park Service has stretched it out to an hour. There's not enough to do there or talk about to take up one hour. It was ridiculous. Yes, I'm glad I can say I saw Cliff Palace up close, but if you don't do it, you will still have an exceptional experience seeing all there is to see, from a distance, at Mesa Verde.","July 9, 2016",Good But See It from the Viewing Platform,101,Saint Louis,4
Cliff Palace,"The sheer size of Mesa Verde National Park is awe inspiring. The park includes 4,500 archeological sites; only 600 are cliff dwellings. Needless to say, we only explored a fraction of these on the day we visited. Some of us were braver than others, exploring both the Balcony House and the Cliff Palace on guided tours, We had booked on the Twilight photography tour of Cliff Palace which was a much better time to get photographs as there were less people and the lighting was much better rather than struggling with the glare of the hot sun reflecting off the rocks. It had started to cool off a little bit too. The descent down into Cliff Palace leads down uneven stone steps, and the 100 foot climb back up 3 separate ladders are a bit challenging for those with a fear of heights and it does require a reasonable level of fitness. The tours are well worth taking the time to undertake.A brilliant day of exploration and discovery which I highly recommend. If you ever get the chance - make sure you plan to spend enough time here to enjoy and fully explore the geology and the history of this region.","July 8, 2016",The magic and mystery of Mesa Verde,5,"Picton, New Zealand",5

The museum did an amazing job of teaching us about the Puebloan culture. Numerous artifacts. There's also a short introductory video which we did not see but was highly recommended. About the tour itself, there are a couple ladders to climb, but more importantly there are two different points at which you need to climb or descend very narrow and twisty stone steps. They take you down to the city itself but you don't get to see inside the dwellings themselves which was a disappointment. Perhaps the Balcony House or Spruce Tree tours would be better for this- we just didn't have the time.","July 8, 2016",Worth the time,0,,4

Cliff Palace,"We echo other reviews that this would be the one to skip if you could only pick one. Balcony house is more interactive however Cliff Palace is much more grand and impressive (and more accessible but there is still a ladder at the end that you have to climb up to get out.)If you can't get tickets for the actual tour, still walk down to the waiting area. There's a really great view from the platform down into Cliff Palace. Tips on visiting the park:We got to the Visitors Center at 9:30 in the morning (on July 5th) and it was almost sold out. I think I read on the website you can buy tickets up to two days in advance which is a must if you want the 1st morning tours. It gets very hot in the afternoon. Our Cliff Palace tour was at 2:30 and we were in the sun most of the time. But the ranger was really great about keeping us in the shade if he could. If you can make it happen- do the Balcony House in the afternoon since it would be in the shade. And do Cliff Palace in the morning or in the evening.. It's about a 10-minute drive from town to The Visitor Center at Mesa Verde. Once we got our tickets, we drove back into town and picked up a picnic. There are several restaurants like subway as well as grocery stores. Better yet pick up your stuff before you even go out there . There is also a visitor center in town that you can get tickets from. From The Visitor Center at Mesa Verde down to balcony house was about a 45-minute drive. There is an additional $15 per car fee to get into the park. Your tour tickets don't cover this. Bring Cash for entrance feeBring lots of water! There was a water station at Cliff Palace that you can refill your water bottles if you forget.

Cliff Palace,We took the 700 year tour in order to see the different sites in Mesa Verde which included a NPS Park Ranger led tour of the Cliff Palace. The 700 year tour Tour Guide was nice enough but talked to us like 4th graders. Instead of presenting the facts she had to ask too many dumb questions trying to get us to tell her the answers. Just give us the facts lady without beating around the bush! The general tour was good though as it gave us an overview of the different pueblos in the park.  The NPS Ranger was very good and provided an informative tour of the actual Cliff Palace. The Cliff Palace was an amazingly constructed pueblo. This is a not to miss place within Mesa Verde. Access is by narrow trail and steps cut into the cliff wall. Not a place for the claustrophobic or someone afraid of heights. Once at the Palace you get to spend a reasonable amount of time there to admire the construction and to take photos. Exit is again by trail and even narrower steps and ladders climbing out of the site. ,"July 7, 2016",What an amazing feat of ancient engineering,49,"Manassas, Virginia",5
Cliff Palace,"We spent two days at Mesa Verde over 4th of July weekend and had the good luck to get all three tours in. Of the three, our group of 10 agreed this was the one to skip. The nature of Cliff Palace makes it that you get to see it from the front on only, where the tours of Long House and Balcony House let you get into and behind the cliff dwellings themselves. Unlike the other two tours, we felt that we were being pushed through the site here, without time to really explore and understand it. There are so many great perspectives to see Cliff Palace from along the mesa drive that you can see it nearly as detailed without the tour as with. If you can only get one tour in and Cliff Palace is all that is available, by all means, grab it, but if you have your choice, Long House (if you have the time for the longer tour) and Balcony House (if the 32 foot ladder and 12 foot tunnel don't creep you out) give you a much more in depth perspective on the ancient Pueblo people.","July 5, 2016",The one to skip,167,"Brownsburg, Indiana",4
Cliff Palace,"Went to the close-in overlook to take some photos, did not have time to do the guided tour.

Balcony House, Cliff Palace & Spruce Tree House are close together on Chapin Mesa. Long House & Step House are on Wetherill Mesa. We toured Balcony House & Cliff Palace in the morning, then stopped at Spruce Tree House en route to Wetherill Mesa & Step House. We didn't have enough time to tour Long House. Wetherill Mesa has lots of pull outs with archeological sites to visit with excavated pit houses & puebloan villages which show the progression of the ancient civilizations in the area.

Still, it had 3 ladders that needed to be climbed & I wasn't sure how I would fare. But I was quite pleased when I got to the top of the 1st ladder behind my husband, I discovered that there were hand rails beside the ladder, it gave me the confidence I needed to get the rest of the way up. I am 61 years old & my husband is nearly 66. It was well worth the $4/person. Be sure to take water & some salty snacks.

Remember you are at 8,000 feet, so thinner air at high elevations. Ask about physical exertion on the tour. The ruins tours are exposed to the sun and can get very hot, so bring water.

Cliff Palace,"We were really excited to go here and see this incredible site up close. We weren't disappointed by the site and even the hike up and down the ladders was a little more intense than we had anticipated... But we were really irritated by our ranger guide. He even admitted he ""goes off script and does his tours a little differently"". It was kind of creepy and odd the way he picked out a young lady from the crowd and made her his example as to how a Native American behaved and worked back then. He then made her pick out a ""husband"" from the cowd and then presented these two young adults as his co-tour guides. It was all very odd and uncomforable for everyone else on the tour to witness this awkwardness from these two young adults who obviously didn't want to be there. At one point the ranger asked the crowd a question, and said. ""Does anyone know...?"" My young son who had just studied Native American history in his third grade class, was excited he knew the answer and raised his hand to be called on. The ranger looked right over him and said, ""Since no one knows, I'll tell you..."" It was very insulting that he ignored my son and kept using the young lady as the only one he spoke to. It was like it was for his own amusement. All and all, I don't think we learned anything about their culture on that tour. The $4 cost was reasonable, but since we were paying for the experienced ranger tour I would expect to get a little more out of it.","June 28, 2016","The site was amazing, the ranger tour...

We didn't get to the visitor's center until after 3pm and still got our tour for later that afternoon. For $4 we were able to get a tour led by a ranger. The climb down seemed a bit daunting. I wouldn't recommend the tour for those who cannot climb stairs and ladders. Once we climbed down, we were at the site. It was AMAZING to see so much history right before our eyes. We were allowed to take all the pictures we wanted before climbing back up the ladders. The climbs weren't as bad as we expected. The tour was worth every penny. In fact, we would've paid more!

When you see these stone structures built into the faces of cliffs you just stare in wonder and try to figure out how they did this about 1,200 years ago. Really incredible to see first hand. I also love driving National Park roads and this was no exception. I tend to get to parks really early to basically have the park to myself.

How beautifully built they were to have lasted all these many years for us to marvel at decade after decade. How hearty and sturdy the occupants (the Pueblos) must have been during that very long ago time.

Fortunately we had plenty and was able to share with some not so fortunate, the park itself was magnificent and well worth the trip but try not to stay in Cortez which is the closest town, I would suggest staying in Durango 50 miles away, there is nothing in Cortez except Mesa Verde National Park.

Cliff Palace,"You definitely need to buy a ticket for a specific tour time ahead of time, either at the park's onsite Visitor Center, or at the Cortez Visitor Center, where the park has it's own counter set up. I was able to get my ticket there the afternoon BEFORE I drove to the park, so almost all the tour times will still available.The Cliff House ranger tour wasn't as physically difficult as the information on the Park's website makes it seem. If you have bad legs or knees or can't climb a VERY sturdy ladder, then this tour isn't for you. But it's not very physically challenging, and its so rewarding to get inside the dwelling area and see everything up close. We had several people in their 60s (maybe even 70's) on our tour, and they had no problem. Be smart and don't try this in high heels, high wedges, short spiky heels or flimsy flip flops. Sneakers or hiking sandals would be best. If it's rainy, footing is slippery, so I wouldn't advise this one on a wet day if someone isn't sure on their feet.Of course, your tour is only as good as your guide, and ours did a very good, but not excellent, job of explaining the history of the dwelling and the lifestyles of the residents. It was definitely helpful to have visited the park museum before going on the tour to know some of the information that the guide can't fit into the time allotted. What makes this particular site so impressive is its size... it's one of the largest in the park. The best part for me was one area where you could look inside one of the towers and see a very well preserved painting of some design elements on the inside wall. There's something about seeing a piece of art that makes a dwelling come much more alive than the standing walls can possibly do. However, walking around the walls and learning about how quickly the natives advanced their construction techniques was very interesting.","September 24, 2015",An appreciation of early U.S. civilization,352,"Tampa, Florida",4

You go down some steeper stairs and then you are in the cliff. You get to rest quite a while while the Ranger is talking and answering questions. I really enjoyed the tour and the information she gave us on the ancestral puebloans. It's amazing to think how they lived and climbed into and out of those cliffs!

There are three separate ladders to get out, and while the ladders are extremely sturdy, it is not easy getting up them if you are not used to the altitude (7000+ feet above sea level).

We had up to 1-1/2 hours in the Cliff Palace so there was no need to rush or urgency to move on because another group was waiting to come onto the grounds after us.

Cliff Palace,"I came to Mesa Verde strictly to see Cliff Palace. I was disappointed that the touted tour wasn't what I actually received, but this did not diminish the awe of standing in a place of its magnitude. This is not only Native American history, but HUMAN history up close and personal. To see the methods used, the heights achieved, and the results of hard labor is truly a testimony to pure survival instinct. Similar structures are found in the MIddle East; it's uncanny to see them here in the good 'ol USA!You must pay to take this tour, and I will say that anyone with mobility issues of ANY type should not attempt this: those with bad knees, feet, ankles, backs, lungs, hearts, and even waistlines will struggle. There is a lot of climbing, steep (and slippery) stairs, and three 10' ladders to contend with. For this reason, I would advise anyone with young or unruly children to also steer clear.But the photos are incredible, and the curiosity of friends and family will be worth the bragging rights you earn when you make the hike!

Cliff Palace,"There is a small fee involved and you must purchase tickets at the visitors center for a timed tour before you drive approx. 20-30 minutes to the cliff palace.(you cannot buy tickets at the cliff palace)Once at cliff palace location, You walk down a walkway to an area that overlooks the cliff palace. (this is where you meet the guide to start your tour.) Make sure you take pictures here. Great spot to get a picture of the entire area. We start the tour by going down some stairs. Then stairs change and actually are carved into the rock and are not level, so make sure you use the handrails when available. Then up a ladder to an area you get info while we wait for the tour in front to move on. We then stand on the Cliff Palace. (I do not know how much longer they will let people actually do this. Some people were so disrespectful. The tour guide had to constantly ask people to stop sitting or leaning on the ancient dwelling. It makes total sense that the oils from your skin ruin the landmark. I saw prime example at a window area that was really darkened from people just leaning in and touching and smearing their sweaty hands all over it. )Then once you are done with this area, it is time to exit. If you want to leave the crowd early, it is permitted. I took the rock stairway and then two vertical ladders straight up with no rest. I realized how out of shape I was. I was then told by my husband who went with the crowd it was much slower going up and he did not get winded.MUST DO'S - **Water!! we went during August and needed about 2 water per person. I gave one of my waters to a family that was very thirsty and sucked it down while the whole time fighting over it. Yep - our bodies need water.**Take a hat and sun glasses. During the middle of the day there is not much shade at all.** Shoes - Suggest tennis shoes with no slip grip. You do not want to fall!!!** Back pack to carry your water or camera. You need your hands to be free to climb the various ladders.** I would really not suggest small children who may be afraid to climb the very steep ladder. (it's wooden tree limbs that are spaced more for an adult then a child) However - my small 9 year old had no problem.","August 21, 2015",Cliff Palace - worth the extra couple of bucks,41,"Rowlett, Texas",5

It is a strenuous hike, there are many steps and several ladders, but it is worth the effort.

They took the tickets, walked you to the sites, and provided historical context as to how they got there. Each was very passionate, understood the history and provided a great overview.

The Cliff Palace was even better in person though would recommend you be in decent shape to make the climb up and down to the ruins!! It was the most interesting place I've ever seen (65 yrs old).

My daughter did just fine climbing the four ladders and I so thank our ranger Kylie for being patient, supportive and informative. My daughter loved it and was so proud of herself. This was much better than the self guided dwelling we also toured. So glad we did this!","August 14, 2015",Tough Time Deciding on Tours,173,"Dunedin, Florida",5
Cliff Palace,"We arrived at the visitor’s centre on opening. Our time was limited so we chose to do the Cliff Palace tour ($4 per person), and was able to get on the 9.30am tour. There is also a park entrance fee ($10 per car). From the visitor’s centre it’s about an hour’s drive to the Cliff Palace. It’s a great tour lead by the ranger, very informative. To enter the area there’s steep steps that lead down. Sit and listen to the ranger as he talks about the ruins and the Ancestral Pueblo people who made it their home. Then it’s a short walk past the ruins with plenty of time for photos or gazing. Then to exit you climb up a ladder. I didn’t find it daunting or exhausting even though I’m a bit worried by heights and small spaces. But some might. Good idea to take plenty of water, as well as hat and sun screen when visiting the park.","August 14, 2015",Cliff Palace tour,80,"Brisbane, Australia",5

Cliff Palace,"My family visited Mesa Verde National Park in August 2015. We spent a full day in the park, including a ranger-led tour of Cliff Palace. The tours are one hour in length and do require some physical strength. Those with extreme fear of heights, difficulty climbing uneven stairs, or challenges with ladders should reconsider this tour. That being said, my sixty-five year old mother with arthritis in her knees successfully participated. If your party has limited time, Cliff Palace is the premiere attraction in this park. In addition to being a national park, Mesa Verde is also a World Heritage site. The history and scenery of the park make this a highly recommended Colorado destination.","August 11, 2015",Bucket List Experience,31,"Wichita, Kansas",5

Chose to do a self-directed tour as the guided tours required quite a bit of walking and it was a little chilly for our tastes. We are huge history buffs and found the cliff dwellings so fascinating and awe-inspiring. The scenery and views on the drive in and around the park were incredible as well!

Had time to look at the museum, gift shop, and eat. We had a 6year old and he was able to walk the tour without problems. The ladders was no larger than ladders at the playground. They have other tours that would have been more strenuous and challenging. Try to do the tour if you can. It was very informative and on some sites only accessible by tour guide. Guides were very helpful and friendly. We bothered one older lady that looked like she was on lunch break for a quick question. She spend time talking and walked us over to the area and showed where we can walk to view the site without a tour. Felt bad cause she probably took her lunch break time to help us. Thank you!

Cliff Palace,"No visit to Mesa Verde is complete without Cliff Palace.The largest cliff dwelling at Mesa Verde, Cliff Palace contained 150 rooms and 20 kivas. Here is Nordenskiold's description of his visit to Cliff Palace with the Wetherills in 1891:""In a long, but not very deep branch of Cliff Cañon, a wild and gloomy gorge named Cliff Palace Cañon, lies the largest of the ruins on the Mesa Verde, the Cliff Palace. Strange and indescribable is the impression on the traveller, when, after a long and tiring ride through the boundless, monotonous piñon forest, he suddenly halts on the brink of the precipice, and in the opposite cliff beholds the ruins of the Cliff Palace, framed in the massive vault of rock above and in a bed of sunlit cedar and piñon trees below (Pl. XII). This ruin well deserves its name, for with its round towers and high walls rising out of the heaps of stones deep in the mysterious twilight of the cavern, and defying in their sheltered site the ravages of time, it resembles at a distance an enchanted castle.""Visitors today will catch a hint of this mystery. Be sure to pay attention to the excellent quality of the masonry. Look across the canyon at all the other structures to be seen. An insider tip: visit the ruin just before sunset when it is closed - walk down to the viewing platform for perhaps the best photo opportunities in the park.","August 1, 2015",Palace? Yes!,43,,5

Cliff Palace,"We visited Cliff Palace at Mesa Verde last week, and it was absolutely amazing. We picked up our tickets in Cortez, Colorado before visiting the park. It would be nice if the tickets were available on-line. This is a terrific tour, but the Park Service Guide, Bailey, was absolutely terrible. She spent half the tour making unsupported claims, and she kept contradicting herself. She based most of her presentation on the ""oral traditions"" of the Modern Pueblo People. Oral tradition is what most archeologists and/or historians might also call myths, fairytales, and fables. It is not accepted fact for good reason. No one would seriously call the Illiad a historical account. The mistakes Bailey made were quite startling. For example, she claimed that Mesa Verde had not been abandoned, but instead the ""Ancestral Pueblo People"" had just ""moved on."" The linkage between modern day Pueblo people and the former inhabitants of Mesa Verde is archeologically weak, but it is a politically correct theory without much science behind it. It is a historic fact that Mesa Verde was abandoned after the former inhabitants had over-hunted the area over the course of a 700 year period, and then the area suffered through a 26 year drought. She also claimed that when the inhabitants left it was a time for ""celebration"" because they were moving to a new phase in life. The inhabitants had spent 50+ years building these amazing structures. It strains credulity to believe they celebrated the fact that they were forced to leave because of the severe conditions. While Bailey claimed that the inhabitants were ""good stewards of the environment,"" she then contradicted herself by noting that the area had been over-hunted, deforested, and the soil had been over-used. Bailey correctly noted that the people lived in a time of survival, but then she claimed that the area used for drying meats and crops were actually built as a playhouse for children, which was truly absurd. There were many more historically and archeologically inaccurate statements made during the 30 minute presentation, which was very disappointing. Hopefully, the Park Service will institute some standard training on the archeology and history of Mesa Verde and dispense with the politically correct cheerleading that we encountered.","July 26, 2015","The ruins are fascinating, but the Park Service Guides are so politically correct that they give false information.",103,"Floyds Knobs, Indiana",3

There were some rather unfit people in our group who had a very difficult time getting up the stairs and ladders. This site is very well preserved and maintained.

These ruins are a national treasure. Unfortunately, they are heavily effected with human use, even with the restrictions on where you can go on the ruins.

I'm not going to lie, I was a little annoyed by the people who were very slow and afraid of heights. If they could split the tours into ""able bodied and needs more time,"" that would be great. However, good for those people for doing it. I should also mention that the rangers have free range over what they say during their tours. They get books and get to study and interpret things as they wish. Some of them are very long winded, and a lot of people sit still in one place while they are talking, which gives you less time to explore. I got up and took pictures while people were gathered sitting so that I had less people in my pictures.If you are in to this kind of thing, do it. You will not regret it!

In the summer it can be very warm and they will check to make sure you are bringing water with for the tour - often times you're standing in the sun during the narratives. The path down, in and back up is quite safe - even for someone not very keen on heights and edges, but there are stairs, both manmade and natural, as well as wooden ladders that must be traversed to get out.

It is best to take an early morning tour before it gets too hot (we did the 9:30 tour and it was perfect because at that time of the day the dwelling is entirely in the shade). It is a bit of a steep descent, but there are some stairs and it is not too strenuous. The ranger will give you lots of great information about the dwelling. You can not actually go inside it at all, but it is still amazing to stand in front of it and imagine what life would have been like for its inhabitants. This is the most popular tour and runs every half hour, so they do try to move you along pretty quickly. The climb up is through a VERY narrow opening between the cliff faces- it has steep stairs and three ladders to climb up. It was a little intimidating, but exhilarating at the same time.

Cliff Palace,"The Ranger at the visitor's center recommended that we take a morning tour of Cliff Palace and we were lucky to get the first tour (9:00am) for our second day in the park. We left Far View Lodge around 8:15am, which gave us more than enough time to drive to Cliff Palace (about 20 minutes), park, and have the Cliff Palace overlook to ourselves before any other visitors arrived.The 9:00am tour was great because our group had Cliff Palace all to ourselves, and the alcove was shaded for the duration of the tour. Our ranger guide was knowledgeable and the tour was very interesting. It was awesome to be in the cliff dwelling and learn about the Native Americans who once lived there.The hike out of the cliff dwelling was narrow and steep, but fun. You even get to see the hand and toe holds that were used by Native Americans to climb in and out of the cliff dwelling.Here are some tips for visiting Cliff Palace:- Stop at the visitor center when entering the park to purchase tickets for ranger-led tours. Tickets are $4 per person.- Cliff Palace and Balcony House are on the same one-way road, so try to schedule the Cliff Palace tour first and the Balcony House tour second.- There are vault toilets and a drinking fountain near Cliff Palace- Carry a backpack so you can bring water and a camera, while still keeping your hands free","July 7, 2015",Take the 9:00am tour,100,"Detroit, Michigan",5

Cliff Palace,"So, I wanted to make sure I put a review out there for those of you that may be like me..and a little ""pleasantly plump"".. LOLI decided I would have this wonderful ""nature filled"" vacation where we would go see all of these great places and hike and what not. Of course, I chose to do this at the end of June.. O.o .. I booked the Cliff Palace Twlight Tour online. If you can do that.. DO IT! So many people showed up and wanted to do it and there are only 20 spots for this last of the night tour. It was so nice because there was no tour coming in behind us rushing us along.Some things to note- Make sure you plan for one hour drive in .. to be safe 1 hour 20 minutes- This is just to get down to the palace location.There is no running water- only pit toilets- However, there are some located right outside the hike areaThere is a restaurant about 20 minutes from this location as well for snacks, bottled water etc.. Be prepared to pay! I think it was 2.75 per bottled waterNow, the steps down into the palace I believe have been there since before the dino's walked the earth. BE CAREFUL! They are uneven and rocky..and it drops off.. So, make sure to walk slowly and watch your step. Also, I heard they have quite a few rattlesnakes up there. So, watch for that too. (We never heard or saw any however)..Once you reach the palace its pretty amazing. The views are great..and our guide was top notch. Now, here comes the hard part.. Its time to leave. What comes down..must go UP!When I say up..I mean UP.. I seriously thought they were gonna have to airlift me out of that place. You first have to walk up a TON of rocky uneven stairs through a tiny passage way through the rock. THEN you have to walk up not one..not TWO .. but THREE straight up and down ladders.. I think they were 10 feet each or so. Oh man..it was rough. By the time I reached the top of the third ladder I actually had a man cheering me on..YOU CAN DO IT! How sad is that?? LOLI had to stop for 10 minutes or so because it was so hot and I didn't think I was going to make it.MAKE SURE you bring lots of water.. you will need it.. back pack it in..You won't be able to bring any sugary drinks, or food, or candy tho.. They make sure you throw it out. So, only bring in water.All in all.. I'm so glad I did the trip. I got some amazing pictures.. (I'll upload some later once I finish editing them)- Would I do it again? Maybe once I drop 50 lbs or so..","July 1, 2015",This is a tough tour.. read on,68,"De Pere, Wisconsin",4

Mesa Verde sits up in the high desert area of Colorado, bordering New Mexico, and offers a first hand look at the once way of life of the nomadic Paleo-Indians. The park offers tours and has limited lodging,camping and dining facilities. I would encourage you to get your tickets early, start out early, bring snacks and plenty of water, sure footed soled shoes, maybe hiking style or good tennis shoes, and wear loose fitting clothing in the warm season...it gets hot and dry!

Cliff Palace,"Because heights make me nervous and I felt completely comfortable on this tour. We reserved a 7:15 pm Twilight Tour which meant we had the whole Cliff Palace to ourselves with this group of 20. I was very apprehensive about the whole steps and ladders thing and spent time googling for pictures and/or reviews of what it would actually be like. I'd say it is more an issue of physical ability than heights on this tour, as one does need to squeeze through some narrow spaces and climb the ladders. Bring a backpack for your camera and water bottle so you have both hands free for holding on to the handrails or rock walls and the ladders. When descending, there are metal stairs and then rock stairs which are uneven, but there are either handrails or rock walls to hold on to. Then there is one ladder to climb to get to the dwellings level, also with a handrail on the top half. When ascending, there are four individual ladders of ten feet or so but you are in a rocky gap, so there is no sense of falling or openness. After each ladder, there is a slight rock step and at the top half of each ladder there are hand rails as well. As for the tour itself, fantastic! Our guide portrayed Alice E., a botanist from the era, and focused on the plants and trees of the area as well as the oral histories of the people who lived in the dwellings. We had plenty of time and space for pictures and questions, and the sunset on the dwellings was beautiful. We had toured the museum and the other sites prior to this particular tour, so having that background first was helpful for us.

Cliff Palace,"WOW. Cliff Palace is amazing, a true must-see. The tour begins at the overlook to Cliff Palace, so as you wait to begin your descent, you're able to look down at the beauty of the dwelling itself -- really adding to the anticipation for me. As the tour begins, you descend a series of steps to get down to the dwelling itself. The steps are steep and the way is tight, but people of all athletic abilities (and even pretty small children) seemed to have no trouble. Getting up close to the pueblo and marveling about how it was constructed and how people lived there -- and accessed it! -- is just such an amazing experience. The guides remind you constantly about the fact that REAL people with emotions and experiences not too dissimilar from our own lived and worked in the pueblos. I liked this approach. On the way up, you climb a series of ladders -- they're very sturdy and placed at an angle to help make the ascent seem less daunting.We also toured Balcony House, which was great, but Cliff Palace is just a bit more ... special.

It was nice in the morning as much of the time you are in the sun. The Ranger was the key to success for this tour. He was great with the kids and enjoyed his role. We walked down a set of stone stairs and up a strong ladder to an area where he could ""warm us up"" for the actual visit to the Palace. A great spot for taking pictures. We were last in the group and this made it easy to capture the perfect shot. Then down the trail to the Palace ( a picture is worth 1000 words). After he gave us the history lesson we went up some narrow stone stairs and finally two very strong ladders. Hint: even if you do not like height, the ladders are strong and not in open areas where you must look down, so if you only have time for one visit...this is the best value.

Cliff Palace,"I’ve been trying to get to Mesa Verde for years and finally got to see it on the way back from Arizona. We only had half a day, but managed to get the Cliff Palace tour. The whole place is just incredible. This is the real deal. You’re climbing up into the dwellings and it feels almost as if you were there centuries ago. The tours provide so much information and well worth the price, which I found quite reasonable. I have a fear of heights and wondered about the stairs, but on this tour it was no big deal – two small sets of stairs. Kids and seniors went up with no problems. As a first-timer, we managed to do some things right and totally screwed up some other things. (Of course, that’s why you have second trips, right?) Anyway, I decided to post a list for others who have not been before in hopes it will help them.  1. If you are considering Mesa Verde Ntl. Park, check out their website before you go (so much information) and of course the reviews on Trip Advisor. (There is a reason for so many “Excellent” ratings)2. Allow at least a day. I say this because we drove from the Grand Canyon which is 6+ hours and only had half a day to see everything, not nearly enough time. Besides driving half way across the state of Arizona, I underestimated the time to drive from the Visitor Center to the sites and then wait for the tour to begin. My suggestion is to come in the morning and allow all day (2 days would be even better). You can always knock off early, but at least you have the option.3. If you have kids, they have a great Jr. Ranger program. My boyfriend’s two boys loved it. Just be sure to make it back to the Visitor Center before closing to get sworn in.4. Have the best driver behind the wheel. I felt like the Polar Express train going round and round the mountain to the top, but the views are incredible. Make sure to allow plenty of time from the park entrance to the sites. I think it took us close to 45 minutes one way. 5. Bring plenty of sun protection and sturdy shoes for trails and climbing. 6. Bring lots of water. It was a very overcast day when we went and my group still got seriously thirsty even with the water bottles we had. In order to have hands free for climbing and picture taking, we brought a backpack to carry everything.7. A camera is a must.8. If you have the chance after the tours, get out away from the group to enjoy. This is my biggest regret – not having the extra time to quietly soak it all in. I cannot recommend this place enough.

Over the last ten years, we've been her four times and look forward to returning to share the experience with our grandchildren. Plan on staying in Cortez, NM, and spending two or more days here.

Cliff Palace,We loved this place. You get to actually walk through the entire Palace and have a very informative tour guide. There is some climbing on a ladder that may scare a few off and you should be in decent/not dead shape. There are a few tight spots but the views are inspiring. Take the kids along id they are not to young and can climb. ,"January 6, 2015",A must see for Colorado and the West,115,"Aurora, Colorado",5

I wasn't up for the tour/hike down, so I took photos from the view point at the top, but my husband took the tour - and couldn't stop talking about it! According to him it was way less physically demanding that the guides made it out to be, so I regret staying top side. The whole park is interesting, and we wish we had more time to explore it. It was a great 2 hour pit stop on our drive through Southern Colorado.","December 21, 2014","Amazing Hike, but also enjoyable view from the top",348,"Surrey, Canada",4

Cliff Palace,I wasn't sure about taking the guided tour because it was up and down ladders etc and we weren't used to the altitude but I'm so glad we did it.

Cliff Palace,"This Anasazi pueblo is the largest cliff dwelling on the continent. It dates back to about 1200 AD. Because of its strategic location in a cliff face, the site was easily defended from marauding bands. But a good thing was not going to last. It wasn't the environmental degradation by this people that forced them to abandon the pueblo. It's true that the pueblo was mainly built from sandstone and large timbers and that those timbers were a diminishing resource, but it was the climate that sealed the fate of Cliff Palace. There was an unrelenting drought that endured for about 25 years that culminated in the native population here finally throwing in the towel around 1300 AD and moving to new locations, mainly to the south and southeast. There are 150 rooms arrayed around about 23 kivas here. It's thought that the population here numbered about 100 inhabitants. The site opens at 8 AM and closes at sunset. My wife and I wore hiking shoes. We had no difficulty roaming all over the site, but I can imagine folks with disabilities might have problems getting around.This is easily one of the most spectacular pre-Columbian sites I've ever seen, and I've seen lots of them.

Cliff Palace,"We visited Mesa Verde NP in Oct 2014. At this time of the year the Wetherill Mesa was closed to public, therefore the things to visit were Balcony house the Cliff palace. We were there for the day and chose to visit the Cliff Palace as well as driving around and stopping at the various view points. Its a very interesting and beautiful place. For what we did the time allocated was plenty, but you want to go hiking and visit more things you need more than a day. We stayed in the park at Far View lodge which is quite basic. Cortez, 30 min drive away offers more options.It's a highly recommended visit as the place is unique and as with all US national parks very well maintained. be careful if you are not very feet as this is located at high altitude and visiting the house involves climbing a few narrow flights of stairs. A few people in our group looked like heart attack candidates when negotiating the stairs, but they made it alive.","November 2, 2014",Cliff Palace,12,"Sydney, Australia",5
Cliff Palace,"Mesa Verde National Park is really beautiful. The mountains, the scenery.... just gorgeous. Visiting the Indian Cliff Dwellings was very special. As a kid, you saw these things in history books and I could never imagine actually being there myself. We are experienced hikers, so we considered it a small climb up and down, but I can see why it is not for everyone, especially in the heat of day. Better to get here as early as possible if you're in the summer.","November 2, 2014",Felt so special being here!,36,"Tucson, Arizona",5
Cliff Palace,"This is a great piece of American history and worth hiking to if you are up to it. Consider it a challenge for 2 seniors, as there are narrow stone stairs, ladders and tight rock formations to negotiate which makes it difficult to maneuver. Not a hike for people with bad knees, respiratory problems or those who are claustophobic.Having said all that we survived it. The NPS ranger, Kevin Lloyd, provided us with a superb hisotry of the people and area. It was extremely informative, and I can't believe there is a better tour guide there.

Once you enter the park the drive to Cliff Palace is about 17 more miles (which takes a bit if you get stuck behind a bus), but the scenery is great. Definitely take the ranger guided tour of Cliff Palace...lots of interesting facts and you get a feel for how the ancient Pueblo people lived. While in the area hit up Balcony House for a little more strenuous adventure. I recommend going early in the morning or during the Fall when temps are a little cooler. The summer can be a scorcher out there.","October 28, 2014",Very interesting,10,"Durango, Colorado",5
Cliff Palace,"Pay the $4/per person (off season price, not sure if it's more during the main season) and do the ranger-guided tour. It is well-worth it to get a little history and context. If you have a choice, get tickets for a group that has a lot of room left - the bigger the crowd the less time you'll get to poke around and if there are fewer people you'll be able to move more at your own pace. Older adults and kids will take longer on the stairs and ladders going up and down. There were little kids, grand parents, and larger people climbing the ladders without too much trouble, but if you are very out of shape or have an injury/disability that would limit your ability to climb a short ladder, this is probably not for you.","October 27, 2014",Guided tour is well worth it,13,"Denver, Colorado",4

Cliff Palace,"If you cannot get tickets for the tour, just go to the view point, snap your panoramic picture and you'll be happy as we rightly felt we didn't need to go on this tour after seeing the site from the view point. If you do get tickets, try to be in the first group, as this is the only group which gets to see the site with no one else in it ahead of them. For this site, that adds a lot to it. It is a very easy in and out and most of the time on the tour is spent listening to the ranger talk. If you can only go on one ranger tour I recommend the Balcony House, but if you're unable to deal with heights and tight spaces or get a ticket, the Cliff Palace is also a nice tour, but I wouldn't put it much higher than the Spruce Tree House, which is even more accessible and free.","September 20, 2014",Most photogenic from afar and interesting to visit,199,"Victoria, Canada",4

Its worth the trip down into the cliff dwellings to understand the scope of the building done by the ancestral Pueblo people. The rangers are thorough and concise in their explanations, and they're encouraging to any inquisitive mind. Drink lots and lots of water to deal with the altitude (and the heat, depending on what time of year you're visiting).

This is the premier ruin and is well worth the effort to go. They do like to make sure you can handle the climbing and steps and ladders, but the walk is short, and you can go slow up the ladders. My only advice would be to take the latest tour possible. It faces the evening sun and lights up at sunset.

There is some moderate hiking and climbing involved, and the steps throughout the site are uneven and mostly dirt or gravel. Once you get into the site, you have a great view of the canyon below, and a panoramic view of the Cliff Palace site. The Ranger was great!

Cliff Palace,"First of all I want to acknowledge the rangers at Mesa Verde National Park for superior service. I called the park directly to try to find out when the tickets for the Twilight Tour would be available on-line, however, that decision was out of their hands, but two of the rangers actually got back to me (one by e-mail and one by phone) letting me know the day that the tickets went live on-line. Given that there are only a small number of tickets available, this was extremely helpful and appreciated. I made sure their supervisor was aware of their great attention to service.The twilight tour at Cliff Palace is not a ranger lead tour. Instead it is a tour put on by a historical society where a person dresses up as a particular character having to do with Mesa Verde and, in particular the cliff dwellings. They tell the story of the park/dwellings through the eyes of this character. The advantages of the Twilight tour is that it is cooler in the evening (we went in early July); you are in a much smaller group than the tours run during the day; your group has the site to itself (no seeing the group in front or behind you); the opportunity to take pictures without other tourists in the picture seems to be much better and the lighting at this time of day is remarkable. The disadvantages are, the cost is greater (but still worth it); you may get more information about the character than the site itself and you are at the mercy of the person who is acting as the character. In our case, our guide tended to be long winded and the pacing of his speech was quite slow. Unfortunately this, at least for us, was too slow a pace, however, others did seem to be engaged. What it did allow me to do, however, was to quietly move around the periphery of the group or hang back a bit and get some great shots of the site. The site, itself is absolutely amazing. It is hard to fathom that these dwellings have been here as long as they have. The mystery around why the people moved from the top of the mesa to building the cliff dwellings and then to deserting them I find to be quite intriguing. If I were to do it again, I would consider trying to get tickets for a ranger run tour either the first tour of the day or the last tour of the day. My experience with a ranger led tour at Balcony House leads me to believe that I may have gotten more information specifically about the site had I done such a tour at Cliff Palace, but that is only an assumption.While I may not have enjoyed the particular presentation by the guide we had, I must give him credit for his efforts and the research done on the character. It was, indeed, very thorough.","August 9, 2014",Twilight Tour-Allows for a more intimate tour but the presentation was not to my liking,43,"Ontario, Canada",4
Cliff Palace,We bought tickets for the Cliff Palace ranger lead tour at the Visitor's Center at the front of the park. We arrived around 9 am and there were lots of times to choose from. Our ranger was extremely knowledgeable and had a good sense of humor. The walk down to the Cliff Palace was steep but we didn't find it difficult. The ranger had everyone sit while he talked a bit which gave everyone a chance to rest if needed. We proceeded to the dwelling where our ranger shared with us a wealth of information. The dwelling was really beautiful and standing down in the cliff dwelling really provided a sense of perspective for how these ancient people lived. You exit the tour up some fairly steep stone stairs within a rather narrow passage followed by several ladders. I found the stairs more challenging than the ladders but I didn't find any of it overly difficult. The tour lasted about an hour. I highly recommend this tour! It was my favorite thing we did in the park. Give yourself plenty of time to drive up the Mesa. Wear comfortable shoes. And definitely bring water. I drank my whole bottle of water while on the tour.

As you look at the cliff dwellings and wonder how these remarkable people survived is beyond me. Their ingenuity and survival instinct is incredible. You don't have to be in great health to view the dwellings. There's several areas to view them but I will say at Sunset View is one of the best to view several dwellings at one time. Also you don't have a lot of trails to walk, it's right off the road. My brother has a bad heart so touring the dwellings was out of the question. The Visitor Center is a great place to learn a little before driving the route. Also make sure you get a flyer, there's coupons inside if you purchase any souvenirs. Not much but every little bit helps. ","July 27, 2014",A Must See!!!!!,83,"Independence, Missouri",5

Cliff Palace,The loop drive around Mesa Verde is spectacular but it is well worth the effort to schedule a tour of one of the sites. The ranger-guided walk for the Cliff Palace was informative and the views breathtaking. One shouldn't go home without a personal and close-up look if at all possible. It will bring the history to life.

Cliff Palace,- Bought tickets for the 9:30 am tour the day before at about 4 pm at the Cortez visitor center. They were selling 11 am tickets at the park visitor center at 8 am the next day. - There is an example ladder at the park visitor center if you want to look at it.- The ladder is very sturdy looking and between some rocks so you don't feel like you are going to fall off a cliff when you you climb it.- My three children under 3 had no issues with climbing the ladder.- Note this is a structured tour.

Cliff Palace,"Cliff Palace was an amazing place to stop and see. You need tickets and can only purchase them up to 2 days in advance. They're only $4 though! Not very hard to get around there unless you're unable to climb a ladder. There were several small children (much younger than I would've ever brought on the tour) who managed without difficulty as far as I could tell. Going early in the morning affords pictures with few/no tourists (get there before 9am). Otherwise going for the late afternoon photography tour would be best for light if you're really trying to get some good shots of the cliff dwelling. Our tour guide was ok, but did manage the diverse age and background of the tour group pretty well. I'm sure I would've enjoyed it even more with a better tour guide. If you're not a fan of heights or narrow spaces I would go here as only the ladder climb out is of any real concern if you are in any decent shape.

Cliff Palace,"For anyone uneasy with ladders, this may help: My husband and I are in our mid-60s and fairly fit but I was a little wary of the Mesa Verde tours with ladders because I have some problems with heights and some foot issues that make me unsteady on ladders. I mentioned this to a ranger at the visitor center when we first arrived at MV, and he was great: He suggested we skip the Balcony House tour (“you get a real sense of height there”) and stick to the Cliff Palace (with 10’ ladders) and Long House (with 15’ ladders). I appreciated his advice and ended up touring “the Palace” with no problems. The ladders are super-steady and sturdy, with fat, rounded foot-rails and multiple hand-rails. Also, I’m not sure why the “Guided Tours” page of the Mesa Verde website says there are five ladders at Cliff Palace (“This one-hour, ranger-guided tour involves climbing five, 8-10ft (2.6-3m) ladders…”) because we encountered only two. Perhaps there was work going on at the site that abbreviated our tour on 6/28/14? Dunno…Anyway, Cliff Palace is the most popular guided tour and tickets go fast, so we bought ours the day before the day we wanted to go. Fascinating: We saw ancient living areas, storage areas, kivas, windows, doors (which illustrate how much shorter the inhabitants were than we are), and a couple of petroglyphs. We were very disappointed, however, in our ranger-guide, who for some reason spoke to our group in a slow, sing-song manner as if we were kindergartners (I'd say our group was 95% adults, with a few 9- to 12-year-olds). In fact, her tour was so insubstantial and her delivery so insipid, we wondered if we’d inadvertently signed up for a kids’ tour (and a poor one, at that). NPS ranger-guides usually have an encyclopedic knowledge of history, archeology, geology -- but not this woman. Glad I saw the site, but everything I learned about it I’ve learned by reading about it since. Tip: In hot weather, try to take an early-morning tour, while the whole Palace is still in shade. Our 9:30 a.m. tour on what turned into a 91-degree day was quite comfortable.","July 9, 2014","Cool site, bad guide -- plus a word about those ladders….",13,"New York City, New York",4
Cliff Palace,"First, get tickets! You must have a ticket to do this cliff dwelling. Tickets are sold in the visitor center when you first turn into the park or at the museum. Mind you, the museum stops selling tickets at 4pm but the visitor center keeps selling. The visitor center is probably an hour away from Cliff Palace so you don't want to have to back track to get your tickets. I did it in the morning and it was cool and shaded. Only about a 45 minute tour. Walk down into the dwelling is easy. Dwelling is very cool and HUGE. Ladders out were not bad at all. I have a bit of ladder-phobia and I was okay. (I choose not to do Balcony House just based on the one huge ladder). My 67 yr old mom was fine doing the ladders too. And many little kids were on the tour and their highlight was the ladders. Really great all around experience. Tickets are only $4 but you just want to try to do it early in the day before it gets too hot.","July 4, 2014",Must Do in Mesa Verde!,40,"Hollywood, Florida",5
Cliff Palace,"We got our tickets the night before as we were intent on doing the tour early in the day. They warn you when you get those tickets that there are 3 ladders for you to climb to get back up. I am fearful of heights and ledges/cliffs, but I was able to do this with just a bit of nerves kicking through. They warn you the drive into the park to get to the tour is 45 minutes to an hour. A good estimate and nice to know ahead of time. My little bits were able to handle the ladders on their own and there were some tighter spaces that I was a bit leery of. I am so glad that I did not chicken out of this tour as it was a highlight of the trip and one my kiddos truly learned things about.","July 3, 2014",Get tickets early,48,"Elgin, Illinois",5
Cliff Palace,"This was the last of the national parks we visited on our trip and were actually a bit wary of the travelling. That is why I was surprised how excited we alll were, inclunding the teen agers. We got a good tip from our motel to get the tickets for the tours as early as possible from the visitors center in Cortez. So we went there first thing in the morning and the first available tickets were for the twelve o clock tour. We were recommended a visit to the Cliff Palace and the Balcony house since we had only a half day to spare. Both of them were different and very interesting. The rangers knew their stuff and had interesting stories to tell about the history of the place. Even with the annual pass there is a minor cost, $4/person/tour, but that is the best 4$ I spent on my trip. The drive from the park entrance to the dwellings takes more than 30 minutes and is very scenic. There was enough parking space around the dwellings. After the tours we visited also the spruce house at the museum which had as an additional attraction a kiva that was rebuilt and open for visitors.The teen agers loved this because there is neat history, some climbing and narrow places. For smaller children I remind there is a long and steep ladder to climb to the balcony house. We had a child about five years old in our group and the ladder was too demanding for him.","July 2, 2014",You most likely need to get the tickets in advance,40,Tampere,5

Cliff Palace,"I took two tours of Cliff Palace, the largest and most complete site at Mesa Verde. Coming away, I highly recommend the twilight tour. These events are typically led by experienced rangers, as opposed to the daytime tours whose leaders may be temporary, seasonal help.I was apprehensive about taking the twilight tour in lieu of the daytime tour because the twilight tour leaders assume the persona of a historical figure, and I thought this might detract from their attention to the site itself. This was hardly my experience, though. My guide, who played the great American author Willa Cather, did an excellent job covering all the salient features of Cliff Palace. Being a more experienced leader, she was also not shy about pointing out the more controversial features of the site. Her tour was refreshing, and her focus on Cather's experience with Mesa Verde added a focus to the presentation that may be lacking in general tours. That, and the twilight tour's later time mitigated the June heat, which can be oppressive, especially when coupled with the moderately strenuous climb out of the place.","June 21, 2014",Take the Twilight Tour,122,"Omaha, Nebraska",5

Cliff Palace,"No less strenuous than most of the cliff dwelling tours at Mesa Verde, this was a stunning experience. The sheer size of the dwelling and the alcove in which it rested left one breathless. Unlike the Balcony House tour folks are not allowed to walk through the various rooms and kivas but it was no less fantastic. Ranger Joe Sindelar is the man and his presentation throughout the tour was highly informative. This is the largest of the dwellings in Mesa Verde and most probably was the cultural center for the area with ~ 150 to 200 inhabitants. Tour took approximately 1.5 hrs including the walk down/climb back out. Not one to miss if you are planning a Mesa Verde excursion. Plan to haul water as there are no snack bars to pick up supplies. There are drinking faucets and restrooms near the parking lot and since the tour is guided there are plenty of parking spots at any given time. For those with time you can plan a twilight tour which is supposedly fantastic since the setting sun hits the dwelling and surrounding cliff face producing some nice photo ops.","June 17, 2014",An American Castle,225,"Valrico, Florida",5
Cliff Palace,"It's a bit of a drive to get to the dwellings from the park entrance, but worth it. We toured the Cliff Palace, and had an excellent tour guide. It's about an hour, and amazing to see the quality of work. We learned so much, and yet there is still so much that is unknown about the people who lived in the dwellings. Make sure to take at least one tour to get into the dwellings, however there are stairs and ladders involved, and you are at altitude, so be prepared.","June 16, 2014",Great tour,43,"Surrey, Canada",5
Cliff Palace,"We purchased our tickets at the Colorado Welcome center in Cortez, CO the day before and had no problems picking times that allowed us to see both the Cliff palace as well as Balcony house. Our guide was so respectful and insightful about the topic of the people in this area and the present buildings that we were left in awe of what we just experienced. There is a small fee (around 4.00) for the tour which is very reasonable. The tour itself is a fairly easy tour but has a couple of difficult spots I imagine for people with difficulty climbing rock stairs and tight spaces. The kiva's and buildings were in much better condition than I would have expected so I imagine that a lot of renovation has gone into making this place safe for visitors to stroll near the walls. We left the tour wanting to research these sites and learn more of the culture. That is a great tour in my book.","June 16, 2014",Amazing,86,"Covington, Louisiana",5
Cliff Palace,"Hubby and I are both not great with heights, so we were a little wary about going on the Cliff Palace tour. There is a sample ladder in the Visitor's Center as you enter the park, near the area to buy tickets. I thought the ladders would be the flimsy sort that you see in photos propped against the ruins going level to level - not at all. The ladders that you climb on the tour are thick wood and quite securely bolted into the rocks! There is one short ladder to get up to the ruins area and then coming out there are 3 of the ladders in succession - but as others have mentioned, they are in a rock passage which doesn't feel so much like hanging out over nothing. The ruins are carved into a cave but the area in front of them is a hill - not a super-scary sheer drop off or anything. Getting down the steps and into the ruin is a little harder than I expected with the rocks/steps of different sizes, but there are handrails most of the way. Bottom line, hubby and I were ok and kids (12 and 6) thought it was very fun - they wanted more ladders! If you're still not convinced, you can tour Spruce Tree House and not have to deal with the ladders and stone steps - but the paved trail to get down to Spruce Tree is a bit of a hike up and down.","June 16, 2014",Not as scary as I thought!,28,"Lafayette, Colorado",5
Cliff Palace,"I am reposting this due to the number of inquiries I've gotten:My husband, two children (ages 10 and 7) spent one day/one night at Mesa Verde. We crammed in as much as we could and did a pretty good job (though we never made it over to the other side of the park). We did Cliff Palace, Balcony House and the Spruce Tree House. You need to purchase tickets for both Cliff Palace and Balcony House for around $3.50 each. You can view Spruce Tree House on your own.Cliff Palace is the largest of the cliff dwellings in the park and certainly very impressive. The amount of time and energy that went into making it is amazing! Reaching the dwellings involves walking down a paved trail. The trail is not very steep and if you're able to walk a block, it shouldn't be a problem. When we got 3/4 of the way down, the ranger had us all sit under a stone overhang to (1) cool off and catch our breath for those who needed it and (2) explain the history behind the ancient Pueblo Indians who constructed them, etc. From there, we walked the remainder of the way to the actual dwellings in which the ranger explained what some of the buildings were used for. We climbed a couple very short ladders (five rungs or so), walked around within some of the dwellings and then headed out. On the way out, the trail isn't super steep, but there is a fairly long ladder you have to climb to reach the top of the canyon and the walkway that takes you to the parking lot. The ladder is surrounded by a rock enclosure so you shouldn't get the feeling of possibly falling or even the feeling of being high up (for those who may be afraid of heights).This is a good tour to take if you are fearful of small places and semi-fearful of heights. Everything is basically on a low level and out in the open. The downside of this tour is that the tours are quite large (40 people). Not only are you with your party of 40, but you see the party of 40 in front and behind you during the visit. The idea of ""feeling the Indian spirits"" is not an option. Simply too many people. However, there is a tour that you can take in the evening (after dinner) for $10/person which is limited to only 15 people if you want a more intimate experience. It's tough to beat the informative tours given by the national park rangers, so if you don't mind taking a tour with a larger group then you'll certainly get more than your $3.50 money's worth. However, if you want a more quiet experience or if the ranger-led tours are sold out, this is an option. (I think you purchase tickets to the $10 tour at either the lodge or perhaps the Visitor's Center. The $10 tour is not run by the park service, but by a historical non-profit organization. I heard the folks on that tour even dress in period clothing, though it's hit or miss with the quality of your guide from what I'm told.)TIP: For those who are more daring or want a more intimate experience with the dwellings, I would suggest taking the tour of the Balcony House (My review of it is posted under ""Balcony House"".). The tours have about half the number of people and you never see/hear the other tours in front or behind you. Granted, it's a bit more challenging, but nothing that a person in average shape can't handle ( though there are some tight spaces, a high ladder and a ten foot tunnel that you have to crawl through). Our kids did it without a problem and LOVED it!Spruce Tree House is reached by taking a paved path that goes slightly downhill for about ten minutes. It's not as dramatic as Cliff Palace, but you can explore it at your own pace. There is also a kiva that you can go down into via a ladder (the only one that you can do so at any of three dwellings)","June 14, 2014",RP: A good close view of a dwelling without the drama of getting to and from.,441,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5

Cliff Palace,"Cliff Palace is the most famous of all the dwellings at Mesa Verde and a place I wanted to go to since I was a child and first heard about it. You do have to buy tickets for the ranger led tours ahead of time. You can buy them in advance (up to two days before and in person and there are 4 locations that sell them. You can find the specific locations on the official Mesa Verde National Park's website). It takes about an hour to drive to Cliff Palace from the Park Visitor's Center so take that into consideration. We were only in town for one day and were able to get our tickets within about a hour and a half of when we first arrived at the center fortunately, so arrive early. The tour itself is great. Tours are considered strenuous so use your best judgement. I'm a bit chubby but I thought the trip down was fine. The do take stops to explain the history so that's a great opportunity to rest, take pictures, and drink water (make sure you bring it!!!). One of the best parts is climbing out of the cliff side using two ladders. Native Americans did not use ladders to climb out so as you are going up, you can see the hand and toe hold holes in the rock they originally used and touch them.

I agree with another reviewer that the size of the tour groups is way too big, but what do you do with so many people wanting to see the place? That said, there was enough time on the tour to see the buildings and take far too many photos. The earlier tours are less crowded so they are the ones to aim for if possible. As far as accessibility, I didn't think there were any problems except for the climb out, and there were people in our group that must have been (at least) in their 70's and looking quite frail who did it.

The climb down is quite steep over slick rock. Once down, the ranger gives a talk of the history of the place and this is a time to catch your breath and rest. Then you are taken into the dwellings where you can learn more and actually walk into most of it. There is plenty of time to take pictures. Then the climb out . . . three ladders (about 6 to 8 ft) almost vertical. The slot that you go through is quite narrow.

I was actually there in fall of 2010, but i didn't have that option where it asked when did I visit. Fall is a great time to go.","March 18, 2014",A must see!,81,"Raleigh, North Carolina",5
Cliff Palace,"I was a bit skeptical at first, as my dad planned the vacation and the description of this place didn't seem that amazing, but it really is quite the area. I recommend also seeing Balcony and Long houses, as they're of equal interest. The cliff dwellings are much larger than I had anticipated, and are actually quite well preserved. The tour guides offer a wealth of historical information about the areas! Don't forget your camera :) Visited May 2011","February 4, 2014",Thou shalt visit this place,66,"Bremerton, Washington",5
Cliff Palace,"We took the tour of Cliff Palace. Our guide, Jill Blumenthal, did an excellent job giving the history and background of Cliff Palace as well as answering questions. This tour does involve climbing ladders through rocks to get down to the ruins and then back to the top of the cliff so it may not be suitable for those with mobility issues. You first have to get down to the palace. The guide gives the history before actually going directly to the dwelling. It has 150 rooms and 23 kivas and was settled around 1300AD before being abandoned due to a 24 year drought. It is amazing that the pueblos dwellers could climb here using only footholds in the rocks. You can only visit with the guide which is best so you can understand what you are seeing.The one thing that I do not like is that they will not allow you to buy tickets online so that there is a chance that you will not be able to get on the tour. The tour is inexpensive though.","February 1, 2014",Adventure to the Past,778,"Marlton, New Jersey",5
Cliff Palace,"We've been to Mesa Verde National Park 3 times now and are always blown away by the Cliff Palace. The views from the overlook above the dwellings are spectacular enough but when you get down right next to them it is awe-inspiring. There are tours of at least 2 other dwelling sites in the park but for some reason, by late October, the only one you can tour is Cliff Palace. We've toured this one 3 times now so probably won't be back. It would be nice if they could alternate the tours.You have to traverse some narrow rock passages to get to the dwellings and to leave, you must climb some fairly steep ladders. If you can do this, you will be rewarded with one of the wonders of the ancients in our Southwest.Highly Recommended!","November 10, 2013",A must see when in the Southwest,261,"Cottage Grove, Minnesota",5
Cliff Palace,"This location is the peak of your visit to Mesa Verde. It has in my opinion the best preserved and most photo ops. This is a guided only experience. I advise in any season to make reservations prior to visiting. The entrance is located a short drive from the Spruce House in a gated area perching above the valleys. Bring water. It is the only thing you may bring along. No food no gum no fruit. There is a rodent problem the park is vigorously trying to stop. There are steep stairs here. It is not advisable for anyone with walking difficulties or health issues. Learn about the culture, architecture, and the land.","October 13, 2013",The Peak of Visit,687,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5
Cliff Palace,"The Cliff Palace lives up to its well-known photos and it's a great place to get a feel for the cliff dwelling Indians. Be sure you have a good guide who can give you the full story about how these people lived and survived in this arid land. Otherwise, you are just looking at a bunch of ruins and you won't understand the significance of what you're seeing. I would also recommend reading the book ""She Who Remembers"" which is fiction set in this area in the time of the cliff dwellers. The book certainly gives you a head start on understanding the culture of that day. ","October 11, 2013",Great Piece of History,112,"Cleveland, Ohio",5

Cliff Palace,"Cliff Palace is one of many opportunities at Mesa Verde to see first hand the buildings and other artifacts created by the Ancient Pueblo peoples (often referred to as Anasazi). It is in many ways a surreal experience - you are able to walk through, sit among and marvel at buildings that are hundreds of years old. You realize that not everything in the United States is ""new"" - there were ancient cultures. The quality of the experience makes the trip to Mesa Verde so worthwhile. It is an amazingly rare opportunity to connect with ancient cultures and it is one of the best (of many) National Park stays I have had in the USA. The National Park guides are wonderful and the surrounding scenery is beautiful. Knowing that the entire culture just vanished in a short period of time - and that no one really knows why, provides that extra element of mystery that allows your mind to wonder.A great place for everyone to see. And when you are done with Cliff Palace there are other ancient buildings in Mesa Verde for you to explore.","October 10, 2013",Cliff Palace,31,"Media, Pennsylvania",5
Cliff Palace,"We had an outstanding, very experienced ranger on this tour. He frequently leads tours of Hopi 4th graders and spoke of how they are visiting the homes of their ancestors' spirits.

There are a bunch of metal steps you walk down at the beginning of the tour, but there are handles on both sides. You get to climb a ladder to leave, but this was no problem for anyone in our group.

Cliff Palace,"We had less than a day here and time for one, good tour. Cliff Palace turned out to be one of the top highlights of our entire 2-week Grand Circle trip. Absolutely remarkable experience to be standing in the middle of ancient history as our Ranger delivered a superb talk about the ""capital city"" of Mesa Verde.We reserved our tickets for a morning session the night before. No mention to us at the visitors center that the one-hour tour, which involves climbing five 8-10 foot ladders, plus a good deal of narrow steps over the course of an hour, was classified as ""STRENUOUS."" ... Wasn't an issue for the four of us, but several folks were so convinced by the Ranger's warnings that they opted out of the tour altogether just moments before the group descended. I felt bad for them. ... I'm sure they would've appreciated the warning at the visitors center (a good 45 minutes away) instead of hearing it down at the start of the trail.The tour requires some stamina -- and the elevation & summer heat does sneak up on you, especially climbing those ladders out. If you're in fairly decent shape, it's a must-see.","September 24, 2013",Remarkable,112,"Chicagoland, Illinois",5

A map is also provided to drive up to the Cliff Palace which takes about 45 to 50 minutes. Tours are held every 15 minutes and tourists are expected to reach the venue at least 15 mins before the scheduled tour where the ranger meets the group. Our ranger Josh was extremely knowledgeable. He explained about the excavation, the pueblos,how scientifically kivas were used and lots more. He patiently answered all our questions. I absolutely loved dwelling inside the Cliff Palace, especially climbing the ladders. Water is the only beverage allowed in the tour. It roughly took an hour and 15 minutes to finish the entire tour.

Again, if you only have time for one tour... I recommend this tour; I can't imagine anyone being disappointed because you really do get to see a wonderful structure and get to walk around the majority of the facility so you can imagine how life would have been for the inhabitants.","August 28, 2013",If you only have time for one tour...,25,"The Hague, The Netherlands",5

The trek down to the site is mostly easy with a few steep areas, but not too hard. The early morning was cool in August, but the light was behind the site making photography tough.

Cliff Palace,"Definitely need to tour Cliff Palace! The first result for every Mesa Verde Google search is Cliff Palace! This is ranger led and ticket based. You can get your tickets at least 2 days in advance at the visitor center in Mesa Verde. I highly recommend this because it does book up. We got our tickets a day in advance and there were still available time slots. *Keep in mind that Cliff Palace entrance is 23 miles into Mesa Verde. We were staying in Durango, CO so we had to leave 2 hours ahead of time to get to Cliff Palace, even though Durango is only 40 minutes away from the Mesa Verde park entrance.The tour lasts one hour and our park ranger, Josh, did a great job at explaining the vast history behind everything! There are so many fun and interesting facts about the park that is just so eye-opening and amazing. I didn't know much about the history until I visited. There are lots of opportunities to take pictures as well. There are a total of 4 ladders to climb, each about 8-9 feet tall. Some areas are pretty tight and narrow! Especially when you first walk down in the beginning and at the end when you're trying to climb back up to the top! You will be huffing and puffing at the end, it's completely normal! Don't feel bad! The elevation will get you, it's nothing to be embarrassed about. There are toilets in this area, but they are all put toilets.

Cliff Palace,"Our guide on the twilight tour emphasized the American history of the area, rather than the prehistory. Although she was excellent, we found the detailed American history of the area less of interest than the prehistory of the native people would have been. The site was wonderful, we were glad to visit, but wished we could have entered the site more thoroughly and thought more about the people who built it.

After a brief intro discussion you have to walk down a series of steep steps. Our guide made a few stops along the way to give you some history and such. It's hard to imagine how our ancestors were able to build these structures- all by hand! At the end of the tour you have more steps and a few ladders to climb out.

It was so neat to be down among the ruins and to learn more about the ancestral Puebloans that once inhabited the dwellings. If you have trouble getting in to a tour or don't have time, the overlook gives you a wonderful view of the Cliff Palace, however, if you have time, the tour is the way to go. It's $3/person and it moderately strenuous; my parents are in their early 60's and didn't have any issues with the walk down or the climb up. We also did the Balcony House tour, and I would recommend this one over it if I had to choose--not only is it bigger, but it seemed to move along more quickly. Take both tours if you have time--you won't be sorry!","July 10, 2013",Amazing!,12,"New York City, New York",5
Cliff Palace,We observed the dwellings from the observation deck. The amount of time and effort it took the Pueblo culture to create these dwellings must have been long and unyielding. We saw many birds along the paved walkway to the observation deck . One fancy bird was the Green Towhee. Fast moving bird with a beautiful head. There are several benches along the pass and we had to stop several times to rest. Don't forget water....you will need a lot. This is not an attraction for dogs so leave them at home or in your hotel instead of in your car. The temperature is well above 90 degrees in the shade and that was in June. You are not allowed to take your animals on hikes in this park.

One note: Do this in the morning to avoid the hot sun ... if the temperatures aren't getting very high (not over about 85) or it's a cloudy day, then no worries. We did it around 3:30 p.m. on a 90+ day and the sun was brutal. We spent more time sitting under an overhang than in the dwelling, due to the heat. Which is one reason we loved our Ranger!

Cliff Palace,"The only way to see Cliff Palace is on a guided tour. The tour is included in the 4 hour guided bus tour that leaves from the Far View Lodge each day and can also be purchased on it's own. It's best to get your tickets at the visitor center at the park entrance but you can also get tickets at the museum near Spruce Tree house. There is a ticket booth at the Cliff Palace entrance but when we were there it was not in use. I don't know if they open it in mid season or not. Anyway, on our visit in May we went on this tour twice. Once with the 4 hour bus tour of the park and then again on our own. What was quite interesting is that the two different guides had totally different things to say about it. They did not contradict each other but choose to talk about different aspects of the place which were quite interesting.If you're a serious photographer, you will find that it's difficult to get photos of these cliff dwellings without people. However, there are tricks. One such trick is to take the first or last tour of the day. Of course you need to consider sun direction for each one and deal with accordingly. At most times they run tours every 20 or 30 minutes and each tour lasts 60 minutes so there are always one or two other groups in the ruins at any time. We found that the last tour of the day at Cliff Palace was the best for two reasons. first is that this feature faces west so has rich golden light in the late afternoon or early evening and more of the dwellings are in sun. When we were there in mid May, on the last tour (4:00 pm) the sun was low enough to illuminate most of the ruins and there was no shadow from the cliff on the opposite side of the canyon. The second reason is that with no tours behind us, the guide was not pressured to get the group out within the 60 minute time allocation. In our case we got an extra 15 minutes of time in the ruins. Not only that but as you get near the exit point, if you stay near the end of the line, you can turn around and get a clear shot of the whole shebang with no people.

Cliff Palace,"We really loved this short but sweet tour of Cliff Palace - only an hour. Our tour guide, Marianna, was EXCELLENT. So attentive to each person on the tour, professional, knowledgable and funny. The ladders sound scary before you go in, but unless you are not physically able or fit, they are really easy and completely safe.Only thing I would change is to have slightly smaller groups on each tour (I think we had about 23 people) just to avoid the traffic jams at the bottom of each ladder. But other than that, it was really great.","June 20, 2013",Well worth the small fee of $3,10,"Avon, Colorado",5
Cliff Palace,"for $3 per person the park ranger will take you in a group of 20 plus on a guided tour. Purchase tickets at the park entrance, the ranger station located in the campground, or the museum, PRIOR to showing up for the tour. Definitely worth it.

Cliff Palace,"With over 600 Cliff dwellings, Mesa Verde deserves its status as a World Heritage Site, and ought to be on everybody's list of Places to See before You Die. We have been here before, so we just stopped at the new visitor center – quite a place – and got tickets for the afternoon Cliff Palace-- largest in Mesa Verde – tour. There are quite a few steps going down and it is ladders coming back out, but nothing the average person can't handle. We had some great views while Ranger went on and on about how life here was lived, but of course you can't actually go inside any of them, and only for about 15 minutes of the tour were we free to look around. That was enough. You don't need tickets for the Spruce Tree House – the best preserved – tour; it is self guiding and less strenuous but also very worthwhile. Hint: if you are looking to take pictures of the late afternoon sun shining on these Cliff dwellings you should be on the Mesa Top Loop Road by about 4 PM. After that the Cliff dwellings start disappearing into the shadows.","June 11, 2013",The Best Cliff Dwellings,361,"Minneapolis, MN",5

There are steep steps into the rocks going down to the dwellings and ladders to get back up to the mesa but every step is worth it.

Our group was small, including a family that had wanted a different tour that was quite vocal about it; our guide was quick to redirect the father so his dissatisfaction did not ruin it for the rest of us. $30 for the three of us, and you walked away thinking.... wow...!","June 4, 2013",TTT,149,"Conifer, Colorado",5

You also get some time at the end of the tour to wander around the ruins & take photos. Stephanie, the ranger who gave this tour, assumed the persona of Florence Lister, an archeologist who worked at Mesa Verde in the 50's. She did a great job of talking about her experiences during the time she was there. At the end of the tour, she returned to the present & explained how theories have changed since the early study of the ruins.

It is unbelievable that we can still view these structures that were built so long ago and we can see how these people lived. I could not imagine living there and scaling the walls in the manner they did. Because of the altitude, we just took our time and was able to climb in and out of there with no issues.

The check-in process at the general store was easy and the clerk accommodating and informative. The campsite was great. Very private and quiet. Bathrooms were clean. The park itself is spectacular. The cliff dwellings are a site not to be missed and just the drive through the park and the hiking is well worth the trip. The only complaint I had was that we were charged for a night we had to cancel, despite the fact that the campground was full and someone surely would've occupied that site.

After they are done talking you can either continue up with the group or stay down below for some photo-ops.The hike up isn't that bad either, there are a few ladders you climb (3 or 4 I think).You are able to take a back pack on this trail, which is what I did, though, you shouldn't need one because it is such a short trail.

For the Balcony House, you don't need a tour but for this place a tour is your only option if you wanna get close. You definitely need time if you're heading here. The national park is huge and the drive alone within the park before we got to the tourist office, was very long. I recommend staying in the park for a night or two if you're heading here.

As with other ruins, there is limited access to most of the site, but you can still get a sense of the place without roaming off the designated path.Be forewarned, you must climb ladders and steps to get back to the top of the mesa and your car.

The climb down was on the north western side of the Cliff, down metal and/or stone stairs. If you are worried about heights (this is me!), it is not a problem. The rangers do a great job explaining history and current events related to the Cliff Palace, the peoples who lived here, and current connections to the Pueblo Indians and others. Note we had a ranger who really honed in on current problems with maintaining this fabulous structure. Apparently recent fires have destroyed a lot of the trees that used to grow on the mesa, so more water is seeping through the sandstone and causing problems where the Cliff Palace buildings are built on rubble instead of stone. We were saddened to hear that a fix needs to be imminent to prevent disaster...I hope they get it done! In anycase, the Cliff Palace is beautiful and needs to be seen from close up. Be sure to take the tour in the late afternoon so the sun lights up the area....morning and early afternoon tours will find the Clifff Palace in shadow. You can book tours at the visitor center but NOT at the Cliff Palace itself! When we were there, tours started every 30 minutes. The end of the tour involves climbing out on a relatively steep walking path, on stairs, and on a couple of 10-foot wooden ladders.

The Balcony House involved more ladders and a tunnel crawl, and my wife has artificial knees. I believe the daytime Cliff Palace tour was the best choice.

One is the $3 ranger tour and the other is the much more expensive Aramark bus tour, which stops for the same ranger-led tour, in addition to several other sites along the Mesa Loop. My advice is to get tickets for two ranger-led tours of different cliff dwellings--Cliff Palace is a must see-- and skip the bus tour. Much of the information was repetitive and it took a huge chunk of time for the bus tour. Once you hear two ranger led tours, you should be able to see much more in self-guided tours if time is a consideration. The bus tour is NOT air-conditioned, but if you are having trouble with the altitude or if you have physical limitations, the bus tour will get you a good view of Cliff from a distance and it is very informative.","September 9, 2012",Ranger led tour best,6,"Apex, North Carolina",5

Cliff Palace,Sign up for this tour in the visitor center for $3 per person. It is ranger guided. Our Navajo guide Clyde was very informative and had a wonderful personality. He was very patient with whiny children and lazy people who tried to sit on the walls. Please don't take small children unless they can climb tall ladders on their own and don't cry/whine.

It was extraordinary to stand there and imagine how anyone built these dwellings so far up from the canyon floors. And to think they did it all by hand! My children, ages 13 and 11, really enjoyed it as well. My only complaint is I wish that we'd been able to tour Balcony House as well. You are only able to tour one per day during high season. Unfortunately we didn't know that you cannot see Balcony House from an overlook like you can Cliff Palace. We might have chosen to tour Balcony House had we known that, but I can't say if one if better than the other not having seen Balcony House.","July 27, 2012",Worth the money,20,"Franklin, Tennessee",4

(If you want beautiful scenery, drive north from Durango through Silverton into Ouray.)We did see a cinnamon bear (cousin to our black bears) crossing a road in the park, but no other wildlife.GO EARLY as it is cooler and you will have more viewing options.

Cliff Palace tour requires going down many steps and climbing steps and 3 or 4 sets of ladders (10 rungs each) to exit. It really wasn’t that strenuous and it was definitely worth it. They say the tour takes 1 hour but ours was about 1 1 /4 hours. Our guide was Clyde, a Native American who added a unique perspective to everything he told us about the Ancestoral Puebloans.

My wife and I carried two small children, ages 1 and 3, in backpacks and they did just fine. Our 5-year-old had no trouble on her own and actually said the ladders were one of her favorite parts of our visit. If you only have time to do one thing in Mesa Verde, it should be Cliff Palace.

Cliff Palace,"Liked the tour and our Ranger had a strong voice that carried well. Very informative and fasinating tour. I was glad that is was only in the upper 70's in the early afternoon the day we went. Just a word of caution about the strenuous nature of the descent in to the site and the steps and ladders out. I am glad that I did this tour but it was hard on my asthma and bad knees. I also felt a bit claustrophobic in the narrow portions of the rocks steps on the way out. I stayed at the back of the group and the ranger did not rush me on the ascent out. So, just remember that you can take your time and rest between ladders and steps if needed to catch your breath. Everyone will have to make up their own mind if they are able to make this trek. If you choose not to, consider Spruce Tree instead.

But it is really amazing. Something that will suprise you a lot and will be with you for ever.Take your time to visit the site and remember, as for all attractions in this area, it is better to visit in the afternoon, in summer, to take beautiful pictures during the sunset. If it is possible better to make your program travelling during the morning, visit the attraction during the afternoon and sleep close to the attraction to move to next attraction next morning.

Cliff Palace,"I can't say a lot beyond previous reviews. I see that the bad reviews tend to involve a relatively bad guide, but we had a great guide, so it was a great experience.Speaking to accessibility: One member of our party had a knee replaced just 18 months before and takes medication that makes her unsteady on her feet. She made it through and did not hold up the group at all. It wasn't easy for her - the narrow steps down and the ladders up were the big challenges. But she would not have missed it for the world. Actually, she found Spruce Tree House more strenuous because of the long walk and considerable descent, which becomes a steep ascent on the way back.And the NPS only charges $3 per person for this. Biggest bargain in the USA.","September 9, 2011","Some effort, but spectacular site is worth it",95,"Savannah, Georgia",5
Cliff Palace,"Mesa Verde was the 5th park we visited during a road trip of northwest New Mexico and southwest Colorado that included the ruins of Ancestral Pueblos. Although I had found all of the ruins interesting, the cliff dwellers were the most interesting to me. After passing the entrance of the park, you drive up and up and up - quite a few miles before you reach the visitor center. There you stop for tickets if you want to tour one of the cliff dwellings. We opted for the Cliff Palace, the largest cliff dwelling. We learned so much about these interesting people. The tour is led by a park ranger and does include steps down and a couple of short ladders up. I was pretty concerned after reading the website, but I honestly didn't think it was that bad (although I had been to Alcove House at Bandelier a couple of days earlier so maybe it was just easy by comparison).

The best part is that it is ranger-led, meaning you get a park ranger telling you everything you ever wanted to know about the place!The walk down to the site involves squeezing through tight spaces and walking down steep, short stairs.The trip back involves climbing up ladders and, again, squeezing in between tight crevaces.This is a great experience, but you may want to do some prep work with your body for a few weeks before hand (maybe some time on a stair stepper or elliptical). Certainly not something for the physically injured or handicapped.","September 5, 2011","Excellent, but physically strenuous.",88,"Tulsa, Oklahoma",5
Cliff Palace,"Of course, the Cliff house is worth seeing. IT is the largest I believe Cliff dwelling and an easy hike, but DO NOT take the twilight tour. We had a 4 and 9 year old so we had specificlaly asked the visitor center ticket cashiers if it would be boring for them since it was longer? This tour cost $7 more a person also. They assured me the guide would be in interesting authentic attire and a real good story teller and that we would get more of a feel of those who lived there and also it would be the best time for pictue taking at dusk. The tour guide was a female in 18th century dress (dissappointing when we expected maybe an Native American dress) Story was everything, but about the people who lived in the ruins and because she talke the entire time, there was very little time to ask questions and NONE for taking pictures. At the end, if it hadn't been for my son having a flashlight, NOONE would have got to see the original wall painting up high inside one of the windows. The tour should have planned for this.

Cliff Palace,"Cliff Palace is one of the larger cliff dwellings. The ranger guided tour limits access to much of the ruin (which is understandable) but one still gets a good sense of the place and it's inhabitants. Access is viable stairways and ladders. Bring water as it gets hot in the late morning. The park ranger suggested Cliff Palace first, then Balcony House. Both tours request reservations/tickets so try to get these the day before.Restaurants and restrooms are close by. If you tour both Cliff Palace and Balcony house in the morning, you can stop at the Spruce Tree House Restaurant (food court) for lunch and then spent the rest of the day on hikes.

The cliff dwellings are very well-preserved and just amazing to see, especially when you imagine them full of life. Our kids (7,9,11,13) also really enjoyed the tour and absorbed a lot of the information.Many of the information sites say that it is not possible to tour Cliff Palace and Balcony House in the same day, but we were able to do so w/o a problem.

Its the easiest of the 3 tours. Saw people of all ages young and old alike, if you have a problem with balance this might not be for you. Just pay attention when you are going down the stairs. First you descend down very narrow and uneven stairs. Once past this it is not bad. Tip try to take this tour in the morning as afternoon sun I hear is very hot. Stop at the visitor center to purchase your tour tickets. Hard to believe that people actually lived in these. Exiting the tour you must scale 3 10 foot ladders which are bolted to the rock face. Looks scarry but its not bad. On top of the Mesa are some great photo opportunities. My daughter got several good panaramic shots.

We visited the Aztec Ruins in NM the next day and learned more about Mesa Verde there on our self guided tour.

We chose this tour because we read from TA reviewer that it was much better because it was toured in a smaller group starting at 7 pm. It cost $10 per person compared to $3.50 for daytime tour. We did not like the tour because we felt we did not learn anything historical about the history of the site and its people. Be aware that this tour is THEATRICAL and the guide plays a character from the past history of Mesa Verde. We stood listening to an actor pretending he was an archeologist. He told us his life story from birth to death for almost 2 hours! We were bored out of our mind!. We felt cheated that we learned little about this great historical site. We knew every detail about a man who lived 100 years ago, but that's not why we visited. We just sat for a long period listening and never got to walk among the ruins.

The tour is given by a ranger acting as a character from Mesa Verde history. We had a ranger acting as Al Wetherill, a man who helped discover and preserve the cliff dwellings around 1900. Our ranger was very knowledgeable about his character, but also answered questions people had about the cliff dwellings from a modern ranger perspective.

The tour guide was a bit disappointing though. The guide impersonated the story of his grandfather who was in CCC 70 years ago in Colorado. While the story of CCC and his family was very touching and I really loved this guide sharing the story with us - this was not the reason we took the tour. If he had spend 15 minutes talking about CCC and then focused on Cliff Palace I would have appreciated the tour a lot more. Instead the whole tour was around CCC with occasional question/answer on Cliff Palace.

Cliff Palace,"My husband, two children (ages 10 and 7) spent one day/one night at Mesa Verde. We crammed in as much as we could and did a pretty good job (though we never made it over to the other side of the park). We did Cliff Palace, Balcony House and the Spruce Tree House. You need to purchase tickets for both Cliff Palace and Balcony House for $3.50 each. You can view Spruce Tree House on your own.Cliff Palace is the largest of the cliff dwellings in the park and certainly very impressive. The amount of time and energy that went into making it is amazing! Reaching the dwellings involves walking down a pathed trail. The trail is not very steep and if you're able to walk a block, it shouldn't be a problem. When we got 3/4 of the way down, the ranger had us all sit under a stone overhang to (1) cool off and catch our breath for those who needed it and (2) explain the history behind the ancient Pueblo indians who contructed them, etc. From there, we walked the remainder of the way to the actual dwellings in which the ranger explained what some of the buildings were used for. We climbed a couple very short ladders (five rungs or so), walked around within some of the dwellings and then headed out. On the way out, the trail isn't super steep, but there is a fairly long ladder you have to climb to reach the top of the canyon and the walkway that takes you to the parking lot. The ladder is surrounded by a rock enclosure so you shouldn't get the feeling of possibly falling or even the feeling of being high up (for those who may be afraid of heights).This is a good tour to take if you are fearful of small places and semi-fearful of heights. Everything is basically on a low level and out in the open. The downside of this tour is that the tours are quite large (60 people). Not only are you with your party of 60, but you see the party of 60 in front and behind you during the visit. The idea of ""feeling the Indian spirits"" is not an option. Simply too many people. However, there is a tour that you can take in the evening (after dinner) for $10/person which is limited to only 15 people that we heard was wonderful! If you're looking to just see the cliff dwellings up close and don't care about the number of people who are sharing the experience with you, this is the tour to take. If you want time to take in the views, structures and absorb the feeling of the place, then pay the $10 for the smaller tour (I think you purchse tickets to the $10 tour at either the lodge or perhaps the Visitor's Center. The $10 tour is not run by the park service, but by a historical non-profit organization. I heard the folks on that tour even dress in period clothing! I wish we would have done that, but we're satisfied with the $3.50 tour we got.TIP: For those who are more daring or want a more intimate experience with the dwellings, I would suggest taking the tour of the Balcony House (My review of it is posted under ""Balcony House"".). The tours have about half the number of people and you never see/hear the other tours in front or behind you. Granted, it's a bit more challenging, but nothing that a person in average shape can't handle ( though there are some tight spaces, a high ladder and a ten foot tunnel that you have to crawl through). Our kids did it without a problem and LOVED it!Spruce Tree House is reached by taking a paved path that goes slightly downhill for about ten minutes. It's not as dramatic as Cliff Palace, but you can explore it at your own pace. There is also a kiva that you can go down into via a ladder (the only one that you can do so at any of three dwellings)","July 9, 2010",A good close view of the a cliff dwelling without the drama of getting to and from,441,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5

You do need to be prepared to say a specific time when purchasing tickets at the visitor center where there is a line.A second thing as a little tip is be prepared in the park to have quarters with you as some very informative booklets are for sale for 50 cents each concerning the different ruins and the kiosks are placed right where the ruins are (I don't think they are at the visitor center that I saw?) - I wished I had more change with me as I couldn't get all that I wanted to when walking around and they helped alot.","June 13, 2010",Informative Tour,44,MN,5

Cliff Palace,"We camped at Morefield Campground for 2 nights mid-week in August. I had read about the Twilight Tours of Cliff Palace offered through the non-profit foundation that works in concert with the NPS during high season May - Sept. The tickets I believe were $10 each and you purchase the tickets at the Visitor Center in the park on the day of the tour (or late in the day the day before). The tour is limited to 20 people, 90 minutes in length, and conducted by a volunteer in character -- our guide was a Park Ranger posing as a Civilian Conservation Corps member in the 1930's/1940's. Having the opportunity to absorb the ambiance of the Cliff Palace as the sunset was wonderful, particularly with a smaller tour group. At one point we had several minutes of just sitting in silence reflecting on the history of the ruins, listening to and watching the cliff swallows come home to roost for the evening, and watching the sun set and cast beautiful shadows across the ruins. Having fewer people on the tour provided wonderful photo ops, as well, without having to work to eliminate people from the picture. While I had anticipated that the Balcony Tour would be my favorite spot in the Park, this tour of Cliff Palace resulted in this ruin being the highlight of our visit.","October 28, 2009",The Twilight Tour was the Highlight of our Mesa Verde Stay,150,Minnesota,5
Cliff Palace,"My boyfriend and I are in our 20s but we're overweight and don't do much more than walk a few blocks in our regular lives. Going on this tour was tiring for us, but by no means difficult. From the parking lot, there's a short stroll and then a staircase before you get to a scenic viewpoint where you wait for your tour to start. From here you can see Cliff Palace below as well as the canyon. The ranger briefs you on safety and rules then opens a gate leading to metal stairs which are easy to walk down. After the metal stairs there are uneven, sometimes shallow and sometimes steep stairs carved into the rock followed by a wooden ladder. Although it takes good balance and careful footing, the trip down takes under 10 minutes and you can sit on the rock in the shade immediately after. The ranger told us about the history of the cliff dwellings while we caught our breath and took pictures. At that point the Cliff Palace unfolds in intricate detail and I felt like I was in a sacred and special part of the world. Each ranger has their own stories and that makes each tour unique. Our ranger had been given the extremely rare chance to climb up to the upper cliff dwelling and saw hundreds of corn cobs that had been there since the original inhabitants left. He also showed us a corn cob that was still stuck into the mortar of one of the walls. Next you walk along a dirt path that leads you onto the walls of the cliff dwelling. I snapped pictures as quickly as I could, wanting to remember every detail. From that vantage point you can see how closely the constructed walls follow the curve of the rock wall. The cave ceiling is still blackened with the fires made by the ancient people. The scale of the windows and doorways is remarkably smaller than most modern people. We encircled a kiva (ceremonial room dug into the ground) while listening to the ranger. We were in direct sunshine for 20 minutes and we needed water before the climb back up, so remember to bring bottled water. We climbed a short wooden ladder halfway through the cliff dwelling. The climb up has more uneven rock stairs with sharp switchbacks then two tall wooden ladders set in a carved crevice in the rock. The ladders is by far the hardest part. Between the stairs and the ladders you have a chance to catch your breath and possibly drink water. At the top of the ladders there are benches along the path back to the parking lot.I HIGHLY recommend this tour because of the beauty of the structure and the history that comes alive because it is so close. Young people like us who are not in shape or active older people could handle it without issue. Kids under 9 would probably have trouble with the height of the ladders and the steepness of some of the steps.","October 13, 2009","Stirring, amazing, and the hike was breathtaking!",57,"Seattle, Washington",5

Cliff Palace,"This was the only park ranger guided tour that we were able to take while at Mesa Verde National Park. The whole park was incredible with great facilities, lots of staff and rangers to answer questions. Wonderful views and hikes. This guided tour was well worth the admission price of $3/each. Our entire family enjoyed the information the ranger gave and the climbing the ladders at the end really added to the enjoyment for the kids. I am not in very good shape and was concerned about the hiking, but it wasn't too bad. Because you were on a tour and listening to the ranger talk, it was a very slow pace giving me time to rest in between walking/climbing. Just take it really slow and remember you do have to climb 10 ft ladders at the end, but for me this was easier than having to walk up steep inclines. I would highly recommend this tour. It made you feel as if you could imagine the peoples that lived there and some of what life might have been like for them. Very educational. If you are at Mesa Verde National Park, don't miss the Spruce Tree House near the museum. It is not a guided tour, you walk down and up the trail yourself. We took this at a much quicker pace, and I was winded going up for sure -- trying to keep up with my husband and two kids, but it was worth it. You got to climb down into a kiva that the roof had been reconstructed to give you a feel of being in such a room.

We ""completed"" everything the first day: Cliff Palace and Balcony House Guided Tours and a self-guided tour of the Spruce House, and a drive through the drive tour. We LOVED it, and repeated the 3 walking tours on Day 2. The terrified feelings came from the warnings and reviews on how strenuous the guided tours are. (Both Cliff Palace and the Balcony House). The Balcony House tour is phenomenal - you get right in the house, climb ladders, super steep stairs cut in the cliff face, and go through a tunnel. They have a practice tunnel where you buy your tickets which is scarier than the real tunnel.I am very out of shape and didn't have a hard time with any of the climbing. The first guide commented on how the challenges of the tour are psychological more than physical - he was right. When you climb the ladders and cliff face stairs - DON'T LOOK DOWN! I did, it's one great view, but made me dizzy! The Balcony House ladders and climb are on the open cliff face, and are more challenging. The Cliff Palace climb down is out in the open, but the climb up is between rocks where I felt sandwiched in and safe. Looking at it from the overlook made it look frightening, but it wasn't scary at all. One lady had to hang out in between the ladders to catch her breath. I saw kids racing up the ladders, and elderly people doing better than most on all the tours. Have fun! We stayed at a hotel about 7 miles north of the park in Mancos, CO. It was a nice small hotel, and a great small restaurant, Pangea, had DELICIOUS food at a decent price. The restaurant was just a couple of blocks from the hotel. If I go back, I hope to stay at the lodge in the park for convenience, but hope to find Pangea still in business. Yum.

Cliff Palace,"This park is an amazing example of what humans can do without machinery, computers, & other technologies we feel we can't live without. This is the less streneous of the two guided tours but you still must be able to climb stairs & ladders. As with all guided tours, the tour guide makes the tour. Some are more entertaining than others but they are all very informed. You cannot climb around on the walls or go inside the room like you once could about 30 years ago but that is so it will still be here for the next generation. Well worth the drive & the money.","June 4, 2007",Worth the $3,42,"Corinth, Texas",4
Cliff Palace,"Cliff Palace is the largest of the 3 main ruins (Cliff Palace, Spruce Tree & Balcony House). The sheer size of the place makes it impressive. However the Balcony House was my favorite because you could get right up inside the ruins.","August 24, 2006",Biggest,233,"Davenport, Iowa",5
Cliff Palace,"We drove a long way out of our way from the rest of our itinerary and it was well worth it. It was the highlight of the trip. Beautifull park, great guides and the ladders and such were no big deal. I have asthma and a hip problem and am not too keen on heights, so was worried. It was a pleasant adventure.","July 9, 2004",My favorite!!,239,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",5
Cliff Palace,"Make the effort and climb down to see Cliff Palace. We were a little intimidated with the thought of taking the 3 and 8 year olds down the ladders but it was not that diffcult and well worth the effort. It is one of the most unique and interesting places in the Southwest. That being said, many regard this place in an almost holy aura (we nicknamed them the Dreamcatchers) and they didn't seem to take to the idea of little fidgety kids in such a place. We ignored them and had a good time anyway. The rangers are very knowledgeable and the tour only lasting an hour is a good combination of info and stimulation. We only spent a half day at the park and were very we made the hike.","June 23, 2004",Worth the effort,44,"Blacklick, Ohio",4
