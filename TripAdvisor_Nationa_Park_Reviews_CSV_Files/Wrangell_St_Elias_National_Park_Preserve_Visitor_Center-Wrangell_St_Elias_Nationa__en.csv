Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"We arrived late in the evening on a very rainy day. We thought about skipping Wrangell St Elias and driving on to another park. But the ranger convinced us to stay. It was so amazing to see someone so motivated and in love with this park. He told us to do at least a dayhike on the nex day and recommended the ""open mic night"" in the Golden Saloon in McCarthy. And is was so worth it! @Ranger: If you read this: Thank you so much for your advice! We´ll definitely come back next year and do some overnight hikes!","August 1, 2019","Highly motivated staff, great place!",3,"Cologne, Germany",5

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"We try to visit as many National Parks as possible when we travel. Wrangler-St Elias is the largest National Park in the United States. There are only 2 roads into the park and they are both unpaved so you cannot take your rental car. However, as you drive the Richardson Hwy you get beautiful views of the mountains of the park.Also as you pass through Copper Center a little south of Glennallen you have an opportunity to go to the Visitor’s Center. They have several buildings including a display of animals, a theater and a bookstore with a ranger station. From the building you can walk down a path to an overlook to view the beautiful mountains.10 of the 15 tallest mountains in North America are in this park.Even though we didn’t get up close and personal we are very happy that we skirted this park and got to see the beautiful mountains.","July 18, 2019",Beautiful Mountains,201,"Bethlehem, Pennsylvania",5

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"We stopped at the visitors center for lunch on our way from Valdez to Whitehorse. We had been seeing the views of the park especially the peaks of Wrangell and St Elias for quite a ways along the Richardson Highway before we stopped in. Walked a ways down from the center and had lunch at a picnic table with incredible views.The visitors center has an overview of the park, the largest in the US, along with restroom facilities.

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,We were lucky to first stop in the visitor center before entering the national park. We got good advice on the road conditions and on top a CD with information on the McCarthy road to play when driving. The children loved this extra information and we played it again in reverse order when driving back from McCarthy. The Rangers were very friendly as they took time to inform us very well and help the children with their Junior Ranger Program. ,"September 14, 2018",Very good information,29,"Scherpenheuvel, Belgium",5

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"Our two visits to the park have been enjoyable. The hands-on part of the center is informative, and it can be done in a reasonable amount of time. It is also very informative. The rangers were occupied while we were in the center, but we were fortunate enough to hear them at the Copper River Lodge. Don't miss an opportunity to hear them present information on the park.","August 15, 2018",Breathtaking Scenery,14,Tennessee,5
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"We loved this Visitor Center and area; it all looks new. The ranger at the Visitor Center was excellent and instructive with our grandkids and their working on their Junior Ranger workbooks. Unfortunately I don’t remember her name, but she had previously been in Maine at Acadia NP. What a great National Park representative! The area is like a campus with different buildings for different purposes.The movie “Crown of the Continent” is good and the theatre is lovely.The Ahtna Cultural Center is very well done. There was no staff person in that building, but we learned a lot from the superb displays.The museum building with displays entranced our grandkids longer than we expected. We all learned.The Boreal Forest trail was easy. Consider applying insect repellent.The views of the surrounding mountains are truly breathtaking.There are many beautiful picnic tables around. We enjoyed our dinner there before making sure we were off the grounds by the 6:30 pm gate closing.","August 7, 2018",Loved this Park,548,"Dallas, Texas",5
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,This is a very remote National Park. It is beautiful with great views of two mountains.

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"While there are many of us who delight in the rugged trek into some of the nation's beautiful national parks, other can enjoy the sight from the air. Flying into Anchorage, Alaska from Chicago or from Anchorage to Kotzebue takes your plane directly over one of the most beautiful areas in Alaska. I'd recommend the flight in mid-May when there is still plenty of snow. You'll see glaciers, lateral moraines, and simply breath-taking scenery. Ask a stewardess to inform you when you reach the edge of the park and then start snapping pictures!","May 14, 2018",One of the Parks to Flight-see,366,"Dubuque, Iowa",5
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,We only had a little time to spend at Wrangell-St Elais. We took in the exhibits and walked the trail at the visitor's center.

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,We made it as far as the visitor center. The park is immense and we were traveling from Fairbanks to Valdez.

Just did not have time to go off reading from the highway.,"November 21, 2017",We made it as far as the visitor center,622,"Camarillo, California",5
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"It's such an immense place, that you need a plan before you go. We headed for McCarthy and the Kennicott Mine and had a great trip. We parked our RV at McCarthy for the night and saw the northern lights. The road to McCarthy is pretty sketchy--rough and narrow. It's doable in an rv or a rental car, at least if there's no snow and you take it easy. ","October 19, 2017",Huge and Spectacular,91,"Saint Paul, Minnesota",5
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"My wife and I visited the center while staying at the Princess Copper River Wilderness Lodge prior to our drive to Valdez for the Columbia Glacier Cruise. As others have pointed out, the Visitor's Center is far away from the actual park/preserve and only about 10 miles south of Glenallen right off the main highway.There are several displays, information on animal tracks and wildflowers and an excellent exhibit hall with great displays and informative plaques. The center talks about the geological and anthropological history of the area from ancient peoples to 20th-century miners - very comprehensive.There is a fairly short walking loop starting at the visitors center, the boreal forest loop, and it is a nice walk. When we were there the walk down to the bluffs was cordoned off. I wish we had more time so we could have taken the drive to get into the actual park - maybe next time. I would definitely recommend stopping here before going into the actual park if that is your destination.","September 30, 2017",Nice visitor center with very informative displays!,274,"Aurora, Colorado",4
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"The day at the park could not be better. We took a bus at Chitina airport, which left us on the pedestrian bridge after touring the McCarthy Road. We walked to McCarthy, we took a turn and in a Van we approached Kennecott, we visited the Mines, we returned to McCarthy, we took a small plane, that took us to see the glaciers of the park and we ended the day in Chitina Airport. It was a perfect day.","August 15, 2017",Unbeatable day out in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve,49,"Madrid, Spain",5
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"The Visitor's Center is far away from the actual park/preserve. I got there early and waited for a ranger to unlock the gate to the parking lot at 9am. I stayed at the center to look at the displays, read some of the animal tracks and wildflowers, and go next door to the exhibit hall. The center talks about the geological and anthropological history of the area. From ancient peoples to 20th-century miners, this covers it all. The couch was comfortable to sit in.I also did the boreal forest loop, although the walk down to the bluffs was cordoned off.The ranger was very informative and friendly. She let me use the employee sink to fill up my gallon jugs (water for my dogs), and gave me an audio CD she recommended I listen to while touring the northern part of the park. That tape came in very handy to know more about that area. (Afterwards I returned the audio disk to the ranger station there to be reused for the next visitor) There is also a small book and t-shirt section here.","July 19, 2017",Highly recommend you stop here first before entering the park,182,"Sierra Vista, Arizona",5
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center, This is unlike any park that we have traveled too ! First the visitor center is not close to the park itself area if your heading into the Copper Mining Town - it's another 4-5 hour drive over a uncared for dirt road to a bridge where you park and walk over to the park area !  Only foot traffic and shuttle service to get to the mine! Tour is $28 @ well worth the money !  THIS IS NOT FOR A HANDICAP PERSON OR ONE THAT HAS WALKING ISSUES ! THERE ARE NO HANDICAP ACCESSIBLE AREAS - if you do have your own electric scooter - you can not get it too the town - it's 5 miles from the bridge on a very soft dirt road !  I myself a handicap person with walking issues did walk across the bridge took the shuttle into the info center where they dropped us off but everything is very hilly - including bathrooms are down a steep hill !  The main attraction is the copper mine which is a 13 story building with stairs ! AND ITS WAS STEEP EVEN FOR THE REST OF THE FAMILY !  The attraction itself if you can walk is wonderful but if your not you'll end up sitting on the bench in front of gift store for about 3-4 hours waiting for the rest to finish ! ,"July 11, 2017",Allow plenty of time ! ,301,"Lake Wales, Florida",4
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,We had the chance during our trip to spend two days in this park. It was amazing. We had a camper from CruiseAmerica and found a place directly at the river. We had a BBQ in the evening with a great sunset. The next day we do some hiking in the park. We love it. The next time we spend some days more there and go deeper into the park because then landscape is so overwhelming.,"July 11, 2017",We will come back,6,"Berlin, Germany",5
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"Once we were inside America's largest National Park, it's difficult to imagine that people were active in this region more than 8000 years ago. Our first stop was the visitor center 10 miles south of Glenallen. There we watched an informative movie about the parks history, beautiful Sibbett and got maps and information from the Ranger. Our 33 mile excursion via paved road into Chitina was our only drive within the park and unimpressive. We decided against the 60 mile gravel road trip into McCarthy at 5 PM, even though we are in ""the land of the midnight sun""","July 5, 2017",Nice Visitor Center,415,"Cardiff-by-the-Sea, California",5
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"Given how remote this park is, I was surprised to find such a great visitor's center. There are multiple buildings with displays about the park, a theater, gift shop, and restrooms. Rangers are staffed in the main building to answer any questions.","July 4, 2017",Great visitor's center for such a remote park,97,"New York City, New York",5
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"Exhibits, nature trails, park film, bookstore, and ranger programs are located here in multiple buildings, as well as the Park Newspaper being available. We took a short ranger-guided nature hike and learned a bit about the Park, the wildlife and plants.

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"The visitor center for Wrangell-St. Elias National Park probably covers a few acres, out of the 13,000,000 in the entire park (the largest in the U.S.). It is very nicely appointed, and several additional buildings house exhibits and a theater for a well done movie about the park. The bad news is that this park isn't for short-timers. There are only 2 short roads into the park; the rest is 100% pure wilderness. Tons of glaciers here, and if you do take the road that goes into Kennicott (a once bustling copper mine now in the park's interior), you can stand on a glacier and get a good idea on how massive these beasts can be. If you are going to Valdez, this means you'll be in the area of the park and it's well worth your time to go see. Just don't expect to make it an in-out trip if you want to experience anything. This is a thinking persons park, not an attraction. One negative: many people see the park via airplane tours over the glaciers. While many pilots make their livelihood out of this endeavor, for those on the ground who have to listen to then roar above, it is disconcerting. ","June 22, 2017",WOW!,53,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"Wrangell-St. Elias is a huge park; it is six times the size of Yellowstone.The majority of it is mountains and glaciers. The park has very limited road access. The McCarthy Road and the Nabesna Road are the only roads that will actually lead you inside the park. This visitors center on the Richardson Highway is the easiest way to get a flavor of the park. They offer displays and movies that explain the natural history of the park. Guided tours are offered around the visitor center to point out the plants and trees native to the park. One building houses the Ahtna Cultural Center. The Ahtna are the people native to the area before Europeans showed up. The center has great examples of clothing, fishing and hunting gear, and explains how these people lived. Unfortunately, the building open schedule can be somewhat random.","June 7, 2017",A tiny slice of a huge park,50,Minnesota,5
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"The scenery is lovely. We walked Boreal Forest Loop and the Copper River Bluff Loop. Neither were difficult.The ranger's coyote talk was quite interesting, as were the overview movie and the displays. There was nowhere to buy food. There was coffee at the Visitors Centre for a donation, but there was no milk.The worst part was that the Ahtna Cultural Centre was not open.","January 30, 2017",Don't go on Sunday!,27,"Yass, Australia",3
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"There were some interesting things at the visitors center, but at least one building was not even open when we visited.

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"The visitor center itself is fairly small. An informative movie is shown in another building. We didn't get to see the Cultural Center. Although the sign gave hours when it would be open, it wasn't. Ranger programs are given in the evenings at the Copper Center Princess Lodge. It was worth making the effort to get to these. It's also worth taking the Kennecott Shuttle further into the park so you can see the old mining town.","October 22, 2016",Informative Visitor Center,29,"Manchester, New Hampshire",4
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"It is a large centre spread over several buildings, including the Athena Cultural Centre and several easy, short walks along the Cooper River.

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"This national park is HUGE and mostly wilderness. It's difficult to see much of it unless you have a high clearance vehicle to drive gravel roads or take a plane. That being said, the Richardson Highway does skirt the western side of it, and there is a free visitor center with information, educational exhibits, a movie, short trails and an overlook. The visitor center and museum/culture buildings were all attractive and informative. Staff were friendly and there were activities for children. The trail to the overlook of the Copper River and distant mountain range is paved and suitable for wheelchairs and strollers. You will have the best views on a clear day. Other trails are footpaths through the forest and down to the Copper River valley. Restrooms are available. The only negative is that mosquitoes were very bad here - some of the worst we encountered in Alaska - bring repellent! You can also see views of the mountains a bit further south on Richardson Highway at Willow Lake.","July 31, 2016",Gateway to the Wilderness,1781,"Tucson, Arizona",4

We were so surprised to see only a handful of cars and RVs in the visitor center parking lot here. The activities are spread out over several buildings and outdoor displays. There is an informative movie every hour on the hour, a small gift shop, an interactive center where you learn about the geology, animal life and history of the area and a cultural center where you learn about the native peoples in the area.

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"Even though it's the nation's largest national park, Kennicott/McCarthy is really your only option for exploring inside the park. And while the Root Glacier here is incredible, I highly recommend splurging on a bush-plane flight with Wrangell Mountain Air to see more than that.

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"This national park is amazingly beautiful and worth the visit if you have a few extra days in Alaska. An important part of any national park visit is understanding the area, and this visitor center does a great job at giving a history of the park, an overview of the flora and fauna, and a history of the indigenous people of Alaska. What made this center stand out was the Ahtna Cultural Center. We had spent a day in the Anchorage Museum learning about the Alaska Natives, but the young Ahtna woman working at the cultural center was extremely well-spoken, thoughtful, and knowledgeable. I appreciated her patience in answering our questions and after our visit, I walked away with a better understanding of the differences between various native groups, and a deeper understanding of what life is like for modern day Alaska Natives.","July 6, 2016",Worth a stop if you're going to Wrangell-St. Elias,18,,4

The park is called the most beautiful in the USA but is relatively inaccessible, there are no marked trailsYou can go hiking / rafting / mountain biking and ice climbing, but each with its own equipment and on your own. It is therefore wise to let the Rangers at the visitors center to know where you are going and what you're planningIn the visitors center you can also find information about the condition of the notorious McCarthy road, the road to McCarthy and Kennekott that brings you into the heart of the park.

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"On my family's Alaska vacation in September, we stopped in for the afternoon at Wrangell-St. Elias' Visitor Center, and it was definitely worth our time and worth the trip (which was about an extra 25 miles off our ""path""). The visitor center is very nice and newer-seeming. There is a walking trail which, though not paved, was ok for my daughter in here power wheelchair. The movie was spectacular, and the views from the overlooks along the walking trail were fantastic, especially on the nice, sunny day we were fortunate to have. It was also a good learning experience about the history of Alaska and the area, as well as the geography of the park. This is one that you shouldn't miss if you are nearby.","October 5, 2015",Nice Visitor Center - Great Experience,75,"Acworth, Georgia",5

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,We went to McCarthy with great expectations.On reaching we could appreciate the wilderness. But But: The Road to McCarthy from Chitina after first 15 miles was terrible.The stretch of 45 miles took us only 4 Hrs?????.Though we knew this beforehand never expected what we have to undergo.Anyways people around say that road remains good till end June & then deteriorates as rains come in.So be careful.and also make sure that your car rental company allows you to drive this stretch,"September 15, 2015",A great place to be in if Drive on McCarthy road becomes easier.,7,,4
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"We visited this visitor's center after our wonderful breakfast in Copper Center. We were amazed at the size of the Wrangell-St. Elias forest. The visitor center had a topographical map of the area. It took a while to study the mountains, valleys, rivers, glaciers. They had displays of native Alaskan artifacts as well as mounted animals found in this National Park. They also had a movie telling about the park. Very worth while.","September 13, 2015","Huge, wild forest",2,"Hollister, California",4
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"The visitors Center is a great place to start when tasking in the beauty of this our largest National Park. The vast and abundant beauty of the mountains and glaciers in the Park are beautiful. We also visited the Kennecott Mine which was fascinating, although the road to get there, McCarthy Rd., is a bit of a challenge.

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"What a beautiful place to visit. There is so much to see that I want to go back and visit. The road leading to Wrangell-St. Elias was not as bad as people said, it was a bit bumpy but not too bad and we got to see a bear along the way. We walked across the pedestrian bridge which my kids loved and the walk to McCarthy was peaceful and fun for the kids. There is a stream along the way that we drank water out of, the glacier water was so clear and perfectly cold. We went kayaking up in the McCarthy area and it was a treat. The only thing I regret is that we did not make it to the Kennicott. We ended up missing our reservation at the Kennicott Glacier Lodge. Maybe next time.","August 21, 2015",Stunning!,3,"San Diego, California",5
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"This is a really amazing park, but most will admire it from the edge. It's HUGE, bigger than Switzerland with higher mountains, 6x the size of Yellowstone, etc. Amazing wilderness.

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"We've been to various parts of the National Park at different times simply because it is so vast. Most recently we drove to McCarthy and Kennicott/ Kennecott to see the town, the mine and this historical part of Alaska. If one wants to take a step back in time while in Alaska, this is definitely a place to do that. While they are restoring much of site (and I'm glad they are) there is so much history here. Just seeing the buildings in their various states of disrepair (and repair) was amazing. This site has so much historical significance that I would hate to see it lost like so many of our Alaskan treasures. If you're visiting Alaska, go see this NOW, before they completely restore everything, then come back once its done to experience it like it was new. Absolutely must see in Alaska.","July 13, 2015",This place is HUGE,13,Alaska,5
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,We try to visit as many national parks as possible. Unfortunately we didn't have the time to do a proper visit here- just the visitor's center. Clean bathrooms. Ranger on duty was friendly and took the time to answer my daughter's questions. She told us they see the same amount people in a year as Yellowstone sees in a week! The light up map wasn't working but what are you gonna do? Enjoyed reading and looking at the pictures/exhibits.

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"My wife and I stopped here while going from Fairbanks to Valdez. I saw the park sign and we pulled in. Our first good impression was while taking a picture with the park sign, a ranger going home stopped and asked if wanted him to take one of both of us.The visitors center is excellent. Animal skins, lots of displays explaining subsistence lifestyle. Nice views out the back. You can see Mt Wrangell on a clear day.Weird mosquito display, a large container of dead mosquitoes!The two rangers on duty at the time answered our questions though it was almost closing time. Then they offered to start the movie for us! It was an excellent show about the park, the people, and the wildlife found there. History too.In all, I wish we'd had a stay there to explore a bit. You'd need at least a half day to scratch the surface of the magnificent park.","June 21, 2015",Great Accidental Find!,72,Massachusetts,5
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"This visitor center was worth the stop. There is building showing history and geology of the area, a 20 min movie, a display of native art for sale and the ranger building. We were able to get some good advice on a day hike to do in Wrangell St. Elias. This area is a place where it seems you either want to have multi day hiking up on to the ridges or be flown in to a remote area to hike. So while we enjoyed the day hike (Nugget Creek Trail), I would have felt I didn't get a good sense of the place without the flight seeing that we also did. A note on driving into the park, Google Maps shows it taking forever to get in because it was marked as dirt. The part of the road we were on his more of a pressed chip surface. Very comfortably drove 35-45 on the road once past the first mile or so.","June 15, 2015",Well done visitor center for the park,47,"Boulder, Colorado",4
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"We love to visit Wrangell-St. Elias National Park. The scenery is magnificent. Lots of great places to hike, photograph and visit.

They have a great movie about the National Park and all human region history. In a theater we can learn what we would never be able see during our tour in Alaska. Very helpful to understanding this great land. Also talk with Park Rangers, friendly and very helpful, walk around nice exhibits about the natural history of the area are some of the activities that you can do there.

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"Wish we had made it earlier in the day so that we could take advantage of some of the ranger presentations. We were grateful for the clean bathrooms and running water. There was a nice half-mile paved pathway through the woods and another half-mile gravel path along a bluff with views of a nearby river. A movie about the park is shown ever hour on the hour, introduced by a park ranger. Our son did the junior ranger badge while we looked at the animal pelts and skulls and maps of the Edgerton Highway. There is a fantastic 3-D map of the park that gives you a sense of the scale and the mountains in the park. There is a separate building with exhibits about wildlife in the park. In another separate building is the Ahtna Cultural Center. This facility appears to be operated and staffed by the Ahtna Heritage Foundation. I was so glad to see that there was an opportunity to learn about the people of the area. A timeline on the wall was interesting, as were interpretive displays about native foods and potlatches. A staff member was on hand to answer questions, but she was reserved and waited for visitors to approach her. A wonderful Ahtna alphabet poster was on the wall, but was not available for purchase. The staff member did give me a bookmark with the alphabet (thank you!), but I would have been interested in buying the poster if it had been available. They did have a case of bead work and other artwork available for purchase. It would be great for this area to have more hands on exhibits that might engage young visitors. This part of the center has such potential.","July 25, 2014",Would love to see more at the Ahtna Cultural Center,62,"Anchorage, Alaska",3

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"Alaska has some great Nat'l Park visitor centers and this is no exception. Definitely worth a stop if your visiting the Nat'l Park or just passing through. Wrangell St. Elias is the largest NP, but also the most forgotten. You cannot enter the park from this visitor center. There are only 2 roads leading into the park. One is on the Valdez Hwy (4) near the town of Chitina and the other is on the Tok Cut Hwy (1) near Slana. This visitor center is located about 10 miles south of Glennallen. Stop in for some good information, videos and pick something up from the gift shop.

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"We have been visiting Wrangell St. Elias National Park for 25 years, and highly recommend the visitor's Center.Seems like most folks/tourists know about Denali, but not so much Wrangell St. Elias National Park. 25 years ago, we knew Wrangell St. Elias National Park was on the way to Valdez, and we wanted to see the pipeline and Tour Prince William Sound.It quite a distance from the main highway to Wrangell St. Elias National Park and be prepared for the drive.Denali is 20,000'+ Wrangell is 14,000'+, but without all of the tourists.In many respects, Wrangell is more inviting. First there is the image and the view from 120 miles away.25 years ago, the Wrangell area was like the wild west; today, the NP (establish in 1980) is a bit more civilized.We recommend 2 days on your schedule.The park includes a large portion of the Saint Elias Mountains, which include most of the highest peaks in the United States and Canada, yet are within 10 miles (16 km) of tidewater, one of the highest reliefs in the world.

Across the walkway 2 young men were building an elevated storage building with an village elder supervising. they let me ask about how they would build with logs and how to chalk(moss) and how to keep bears from raiding (bear grease on poles that elevate storage- deter other bears and animals). They also explained how the large outside fish trap works (scoopers with a incline ending in hole on scooper that slide fish into basket on side) Inside was a fish trap built by one of the young men's his grandmother.

The displays were informative and well laid out. We particularly enjoyed the building dedicated to the Native Americans. The views from the walking trails of the mountains were spectacular. It is definitely a great stop if you were traveling the Richardson Highway. That said the day we were there the staff looked to be doing some training and had limited availability for interacting with guests. Also the two young ladies in the native American building were very informative when approached but we had to approach them first. The last thing is I hope people don't get the impression that the visitor center is the best way to see the park.

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"We are huge National Park fans and have actively visited our parks for the last three decades. It is with considerable hesitation that I post a review that does anything less than heap praise on Wrangell-St. Elias. And to be clear, the park itself is SPECTACULAR. An absolutely stunning place. Unfortunately the Visitor Center itself doesn't quite live up to the park.The facility itself is very nice and most of the displays were informative. Unfortunately, when we asked a few questions about the displays (specifically in the building that was set to represent the Native culture) we were surprised at how little the people working the exhibit knew about what was on the walls. For instance, there was a cool timeline with drawings that represented the history of the local native people and when we asked a couple of questions about the timeline/drawings, the two young ladies working the exhibit had no clue what they meant. And worse yet, they didn't seem very interested themselves!The other issue we had with the place was how far it is from the actual main portion of the park. It is literally several hours from McCarthy. I suppose it was originally built there because most people were too intimidated by the McCarthy Road (don't be...see review on the road) to actually venture into the park. That said, it would be like putting the Big Bend Visitor Center in El Paso. It totally looses the feel of the park. The good news is there is a small Visitor Center in Kennicott which is set up like an old general store for the mine and let's the kiddos do the junior ranger thing. It even has a small selection of books and souvenirs for those so inclined. And certainly if these are the main reasons you would stop into the Visitor Center, go to the one in Kennicott and blow this one off. The bottom line, if you're driving past Copper Center it's worth a stop and a stretch of the legs. That said, you won't get a feel for the park unless you actual drive to McCarthy and spend a few days...which is ABSOLUTELY worth the effort!","August 30, 2013",Mixed feelings on this one...,124,"Missoula, Montana",3
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"Be sure to stop at the visitor center before venturing into Wrangell-St Elias National Park. The center is full of information and park rangers can update you on activity and road conditions throughout the park. The buildings are all new. There is a building housing the visitor center and gift shop, one housing the theater that shows the park movie, a restroom building, and a museum that we did not venture into. Everything was pristine. There are trails surrounding the center offering incredible views. You can even take a stroll down the old Valdez trail, located a short walk from the buildings. This is a great stop on its own, but also a necessity to make the most out of a visit to Wrangell-St Elias National Park.

Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"We took a short trip to Wrangell-St.Elias NAtional Park with our 4 kids (5-10yo). We stopped off at the Cooper Center Ranger Station on our way to McCarthy. The center has a nice movie, great exhibits, & helpful rangers. The kids did the junior ranger program there. They have a short trail (0.5-1.0 mile) around the grounds which was great to stretch your legs. This is not like Denali National Park which has tons of trails near the visitor's center & a bus into the park. It is for a more independent traveler. The park is truly incredible but you have to make lots of plans on your own to see it. We only went to McCarthy/Kennicott. It was fantastic & like nothing you've ever seen before - very UNTOUCHED and remote. If you're wanting to see the park you've got to go farther than the visitor's center, but this is a great starting point & they're very helpful to get you where you want to go.","August 15, 2013",Great Visitor's Center,26,"Louisville, Kentucky",4
Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve Visitor Center,"The Park visitor's center is rather typical of a National Park though it is spread out over several buildings. It is nice.The Wrangle-St. Elias area is not really suited for the road trip vacationer. We desired to see this spectacular wilderness, but (our fault) we did not allow ourselves enough time. One afternoon is not adequate. Some National Parks you can get a flavor for it by stopping at the Visitor's Center and driving through the key or core area. I know you miss a lot that way but you do get a taste for it. This Park is different. The only way into the Park involves rather great distances on gravel roads. For those with rental cars you are potentially at risk if you go on the gravel roads and have any problems. Check with your rental car company when you rent. We planned to drive from Valdez and stop at Wrangle-St. Elias for the late morning and into the afternoon. Well, we took too long viewing Keystone Canyon and Worthington Glacier and we didn't make it to this area until after lunch. By then and with a rental car there was not a lot we could do. By the time you are at the Visitor's Center you are about equidistant from the two access roads into the Park. Depending on your evening destination one road is out of the way and the other may still be too far to accomplish much for the expenditure of time and fuel plus the risk to the car.We had planned to do the Liberty Falls hike off of the Edgerton Highway, but turned back too soon. Then we were going to do the Caribou Creek Trail off of the Nabesna Road, but that was too far as it turned out. Both of these destinations required travel on gravel roads. The ranger at the Visitor's Center didn't seem to have much patience, encouragement or time for me probably knowing the hopelessness of my situation. There is a short hike by the Visitor's Center which is nice, but be prepared for the mosquitoes.I guess my advice to the ""road trip vacationer"" is to probably not plan to see much of this spectacular and huge Park. Unless you have a couple of days to devote to it and are willing to drive many miles, including a lot of miles on a gravel road, you will not see that much. The Park is the size of New Hampshire or Vermont or perhaps the two together, so it is huge. You could do a flightseeing trip but that gets very expensive. Perhaps spend your valuable Alaska time somewhere else.","August 7, 2013",Wrangle-St. Elias National Park and Preserve,40,,4
