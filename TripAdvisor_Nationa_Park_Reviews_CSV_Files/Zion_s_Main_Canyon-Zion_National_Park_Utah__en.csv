Zion's Main Canyon,"It's somewhat difficult to describe what we saw because simply saying adjectives such as beautiful, awe-inspiring, wonderful, etc. do not actually tell others the colors and majesty of this National park. ","October 9, 2019",Unbelievably beautiful...,119,"Bangor, Maine",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"This is our second visit to Zion in three years. Glad we returned. Please spend at least a whole day exploring the area.People have written lots about the majesty of Zion. Don't know what additional to write except for our impressions.The shuttle system is great. Gets busy as the day goes on. But wonderful nonetheless. But, parking is an issue. We stayed in Springdale and left our car at the motel and walked to the free town shuttle which took us near to the Zion Visitor Center and entrance where we could get the Zion shuttle.Surprising to us, early October was quite busy. In chatting with locals, they say it's continued to get busier as the years go by. Do everything early. And expect crowds.The Visitor Center and Museum are just so-so for a National Park. Worth time. But not a whole lot of time.Take hikes. We feel that's the way to best see the Park. We took several short hikes. They were well worth it.And look up! The Canyon is amazing. Go all the way to the end. You don't need to hike the stream to appreciate this special place. Drive through the tunnel. Pretty neat!","October 6, 2019",Magical Place,323,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Our group of four couples traveling together spent three days in Zion’s Main Canyon. We hiked many trails (including Angels Landing), went horseback riding and became best friends with shuttle drivers. We had lunch at the Zion Lodge Dining Room one day.

Zion's Main Canyon,"A treat for the human eye. Hardly anything else in the world compares to this place. Absolutely awesome, stunning, beautiful and very peaceful. A must see. I'd rank up there with Yosemite, Banff and Yellowstone as one of the most gorgeous, jaw dropping sites in North America. Great hiking available.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We drove into Zion National Park from the East Entrance which was beautiful and awe inspiring. We then stayed the night at the lodge. It was so/so and in need of a little upkeep and freshening up. It was ok for one night of sleep. The night we got to Zion the kids and I hiked the Grotto (boring) and Emerald Pools Trail (relaxing and interesting). We then ate at the Lodge which had pretty good food. The next morning we woke up and took the shuttle around 9/9:30am to do the Riverside Walk. It was cool and shaded in the morning and was such a neat hike as every twist you saw something different. You can also choose to walk down near the water instead. Most of the walk is paved, but if you want to plan ahead and go down to the Narrows, you can. We then stopped by the Visitor Center around 11am on our way out - it was very busy and we had a hard time finding a spot to park. Be sure to check out the souvenir shop at the Lodge in addition to the Visitor Center - the offerings are different. I would highly recommend a day trip, 1 night trip, or driving through trip of Zion. It was magnificent.","July 20, 2019",Beautiful National Park - Take as Much or Little Time as You Need,60,"Houston, Texas",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"I visited Zion in early spring after some severe weather so many of the more popular hiking trails were closed. I ended up doing many of the easier hikes in the park, including the Riverside Walk, Lower Emerald Pool, Watchman Trail, Canyon Overlook and part of Angels Landing (scary as hell!) and North Rim Trail. I would have loved to hike the Narrows but they were closed on the day. The park was very busy but the shuttle bus system worked very well, including from Springdale where I stayed. Zion was my first of the Utah Mighty 5 and I was completely sold on its beauty. Little did I know that the best was yet to come.Read more on my blog Hopping Around the Globe in Style.","July 15, 2019",Lovely easy hikes!,24,"Vienna, Austria",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"The pictures really don't do it justice. The red canyon walls are amazing as you walk the trails. Once you get to the Riverside Walkway, the walls are close together and you walk the river to the start of the Narrow Trail, which was closed when we were there. The river was pretty deep and moving way to fast to be able to walk in it. My daughter loves Zion and says it was better than Yosemite Valley. I'm still partial to Yosemite, but that is absolutely no knock on Zion. It is awesome.","June 20, 2019",My Daughter's New Favorite Place,283,Indiana,5

Zion's Main Canyon,"Beautiful, amazing, spectacular, choose whatever description you want and it won’t even come close to describing Zion Canyon. I’ve been here 3 times, and this last visit was the most amazing so far. We went in early April, which had its ups and downs. There was so much water so there were waterfalls and water in places I’ve never seen. The Virgin River though was to high to explore, even outside the Narrows. There were less crowds, and even some really quiet trails.Love this places!!!!!!!","May 7, 2019",It’s Amazing and You Already Knew That,242,"Carrollton, Texas",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"Utah has 5 beautiful National Parks and Zion is the first one you will discover if you are beginning your trip after a flight into Las Vegas. If you're visiting in the summer you will find it crowded. If you're visiting during a holiday you will find it crowded. As a matter of fact it is almost always crowded. Best advice is arrive early in the a.m. If you get there later you may have to stand in line while a couple of completely filled shuttle buses pass you by because they are full. But go anyway - you probably stood in line in Disney and this is a heck of a lot better. Be sure and stop in at the Visitor's Center and ask about the trails. Hiking is excellent but don't be surprised to find one or more of the trails closed for maintenance - heavy rain storms have wrecked havoc in some parts of the park. Watch for Bighorn sheep and crazy rock climbers! Take your time, take a deep breath, don't let the crowds get to you - whatever you might have to endure Zion is worth it. There is a reason why Zion is one of the most visited parks in the system.","May 3, 2019",Start your tour of the Big Five here.,81,"St. George, Utah",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Been to Zions many times, every time of the year the scenery is different. Camping available. The Zions visitor center is full of, information and you can catch the shuttle there to take you back to town or up into the park. Hikes for all, with Angels Landing for the very experienced. Summer hasn't hit yet, but the wait at the top of Angels was 50 min to 2 hours. The earlier the better. Narrows was closed due to high runoff. I don't think there are a tremendous amount of things to do in this park, But never the less, still a must see.

Lots to do and see, with hiking trails throughout for all levels of fitness.You can stay in the canyon at the one Lodge but it is pricey but you can drive your car in and park there. This gives you early (and late) access to the Canyon and Park if you want so there is a trade off there for sure. If you are not staying there, you have to get in and through the canyon by a free reliable shuttle bus. I went there in late November and the leaves had just fallen and the views/scenery even there were spectacular. It is even more beautiful in the Spring and Summer for sure. Lots to see and do, well worth a few days there and at least one overnight too.Don't miss it.","February 6, 2019","Wonderful picturesque Canyon, world class, don't miss it",860,"Denver, Colorado",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"We've been here and done that but this park is so rich in features that it feels new each time. Got there as early as we could and walked the entire main canyon and a few of the side climbs. Our ages ranged from 24 to 82 and while some of the trails were hard, narrow and a bit unsettling, we were completely smitten and overwhelmed by the beauty and uniqueness of this space. The key on any day is go early or don't go. The park is packed and the only way to get anywhere is to take one of the buses to the far end and walk back. If you get there late, you can wait for an hour or more. Pack in your own food. What's in the park sucks.","February 4, 2019",Incredible every time.,77,"Kensington, Maryland",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"Such a beautiful place! The shuttle system is very well done. You can get on and off easily. Mornings are the best time if you truly want to avoid crowds at any time of year. We hiked to Angel's Landing and did most of the Narrows. Going to the end at Angel's Landing was not as scary as I thought, but I would not have taken children nor would I have done it if it was raining or snowing. The view from the landing is stunning. You're at the top and looking down into the canyon. Wow! Wear a beanie or a hood as it can get windy in the mornings in November. Light gloves and layers were good. In the Narrows, your feet will get wet even if you rent the gear. Just plan to get wet and have fun! The neoprene socks will keep your feet warm. If you're able to purchase your own ""wet"" socks and have a pair of shoes with grips you don't mind getting wet, those will work. Bring a walking stick even if it's just a tree branch. It will help with balance as you meander through the river and rocks. Quick dry pants you can roll up to your knees or shorts will work. We didn't get into any water above mid-thigh (except when the hubby had a slip :). Light, water resistant gloves would also be nice for the early morning. Enjoy!","November 17, 2018",Amazing!,26,"Benson, Arizona",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"We just drove into Zion National Park this afternoon and were so appalled to see so many dead fawns on the side of the road! In just a 3/4 mile stretch, we saw 8 bloody bodies! Very upsetting! When we pulled into our hotel in the evening, we spoke to another family that entered park via another gate, and they told us how upset they were about seeing more than 20 dead fawns on the side of the road in less than a mile stretch- bodies scattered along the road! One ranger even said that the dead fawns were outside national park lands, and it was unlikely they’d do anything about it...im sure this park is lovely, but that sight was not the best of calling cards!

Zion's Main Canyon,"This was another amazing adventure and would highly recommend visiting. You need plenty of time to explore the 9 stops within this park especially if you plan to do the trek through the canyon river. The river can be deep at times with quite a strong current at points and apparently prone to flash flooding. We had a great time with no issues.There is an outfitter in the park that can rent you the water shoes and socks, the waterproof pants and the long stick which is very helpful in finding the deep spots in the river and where to walk. We didn't get the chance to do the other stops as we unfortunately didn't allow for enough time. But what we did experience in the narrow canyons was spectacular with many beautiful photo ops.","October 14, 2018",Exploring The Canyons,0,,5

Zion's Main Canyon,"We took an Insight Tour of western National Parks. Zion was one of our favorites. It is quite different from Yellowstone and Bryce - but we were very glad we came here.The main canyon is spectacular beyond words. There are many, many ways to enjoy it, from simply sitting and looking up, to a vast array of hikes, from very short and easy to challenging. You also can take the free shuttle through the canyon.","September 8, 2018",Spectacular - so many ways to enjoy - strongly recommended,893,"Saint Paul, Minnesota",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"In All fairness my husband and I were in the middle of a long trip west. We took in a number of National Parks prior to Zion. Zion was my least favorite out of them all. Yes it has its beauty, but I would have preferred to be able to drive myself. Didn’t take that long to catch a shuttle. Parking wasn’t too bad, but we didn’t arrived until around 3. We did not do any of the long hikes because by the time we got to the end it was getting late & we had done quite a bit of walking earlier in the day at Bryce Canyon not counting the shorter ones there. Zion National Park is Worth the visit even if you just ride the shuttle. Mount Carmel Scenic Hwy coming is was beyond beautiful. Stop in at the Lodge.

Zion's Main Canyon,"My father took me to Zion Canyon and so I had to take my son there on trip out West.It is amazing place to take a hike (which we did along the Virgin River) to view the geology (in contrast to Grand Canyon, at Zion Canyon you are usually at the bottom looking up), and to sit and watch the stars on a clear night (we got a meteor shower) with almost no city lights and only occasional traffic.","August 15, 2018",My father took me and I just took my son....,149,"Winston Salem, North Carolina",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"My wife and I had only half a day at Zion, and we worried that we wouldn't even get through the entrance before we had to leave. Not so! Here are some relatively obvious pointers if you only have a few hours:1. Wait until you're over 62, since the price drops to $20. This gives you a Senior Pass to all National Parks. That's a super deal. Even if you have to pay full price for a carload of kids, it's worth the $35.2. Go early. I know this is obvious, but you HAVE to get there before 9:00, and preferably before 8:00. However, you will be in shadows for much of your visit until the sun gets overhead. On the other hand, it's not blistering hot.3. Take the shuttle all the way to the end (Narrows), which is Stop 9. Even if you want to see the other places, see them on the way back down. Check out which locations look good on the way up, but don't get off.4. Give the Narrows a chance, even if you don't want to battle the crowds or go too far up. Wear water shoes, pack light, bring one or two walking sticks if you're unstable, and walk upstream for at least 15-20 minutes. It's fascinating!5. The shuttles are so frequent, and relatively ""unpacked"" that you can get off at, say, Big Bend and be on the next shuttle in 8 minutes. 6. We didn't go to the museum, but we would have understood a lot more had we watched the movie. You can easily walk from the museum to the parking area at the entrance to the park. 7. Finally, and I know this takes some planning, but absolutely, 100% drive out the east entrance. I found it to be the most amazing highway/driving experience ever. Incredible rock formations, vistas, and highway-construction makes this in many ways as interesting as the canyon. Yes, it's a long way from the east entrance to the next ""thing"" (probably Bryce Canyon National Park, or the north rim of the Grand Canyon), but it's a wonderful drive.","August 11, 2018","So worth a visit, even if you only have a few hours! Best park ever!",241,"Santa Cruz, California",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"This is a beautiful national park! Make sure you arrive early, because the line to enter the bus is pretty large in the peak season. I arrived at 7:45 (park opens at 8) and had to wait probably 30-40 minutes to enter a bus. The parking usually fills around 8:30. During the peak season, you cannot drive through Zion and must use the bus system. The bad thing is when the bus comes, people cut in line (had that happen a couple of times). The park is beautiful though!","August 7, 2018",One of the best national parks,82,,5
Zion's Main Canyon,"We arrived at South entrance of Zion after one hour drive from St George. The $35 entry fee for private vehicles was waived with one National Park Pass. There was still parking at 8:15am on a July Sunday in the large Visitor's Center parking lot. Weekends are usually more crowded but half of St. George locals were in church on Sunday morning. We only had to compete with tourists for parking spaces. All the available parking outside the park in city of Springdale appeared to be paid parking areas.Don’t waste time standing in long line to talk to Rangers at Visitor’s Center. Research online in advance. Also, Bus Stop 1 at the Center has signs stating what is at each stop. We planned for the easiest and shortest trails (Lower Emerald Pools and Riverside Walk). We stood in long, organized, chained line for double length shuttle bus at Bus Stop 1. Bus was coming every 2 minutes. No one had to stand yet. Employees kept efficient count for each bus.It took us 30 minutes to board which is longer than the 15 minutes stated on a sign.We exited at Bus Stop 5 for Emerald Pools. Due to July 11 storm damages, there was no access to middle and upper pools or Kayenta Trails. Lower pools trail ended abruptly with expected repairs in a few months. Lower Emerald Pools was an easy trail but deep tread shoes are still recommended. Some gritty water was on paved walkway. Since trail ended too early, there was not much to view. After an hour on Lower Pools trail, we went to Riverside Walk at Bus Stop 9.Note: There are two boarding areas at Stop 5 next to each other. The front boarding area goes to stop 4. The back boarding area is for going onward to Stop 6.Most of the paved Riverside Walk trail is easy enough for wheelchair and strollers. People went into the river at many points along the trail. (Wear bathing suit and bring beach shoes.) At about midpoint, a sign warns that wheelchairs should not continue due to 20% grade. At end of Riverside Walk, the path to continue to Narrows is rocky along the river with possible flash floods. (July and August are thunderstorm months. If weather looks bad in afternoons, dangerous flash floods are possible.) Riverside walk in morning was a pleasant two hour leisurely, scenic walk with most of walk was in the shade.","July 30, 2018",Popular National Park near St George,151,"Anaheim, California",5

The buses were not over packed and everyone had a seat! Even in mid May there were plenty of tourists. There were views that could be had from the bus stops.

We were in the park by 0800 and got a good parking place at the visitor center. The shuttle is a must to get around the park. We waited an hour in line, but it was well organized and a great way to people watch. We took the shuttle to the Emerald Pools, nice hike and beautiful scenery. We were walking back to catch the shuttle and decided we were hungry. Got some great sack lunches at the Lodge. After lunch it was very hot so we went to the museum.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Family of 4 adults spent 3 days in Zion National Park hiking. It is the 5th most popular Park in the National Park system and is as beautiful as touted. It is also a very busy Park with lots of visitors during the summer season. To accommodate the number of vehicles carrying all those visitors and reduce congestion on the park roads, the NPS has a free shuttle that carries visitors up the canyon to the major sites. This worked very well for the most part during our stay will very little wait time at the shuttle stops during the day once we were in the canyon. The shuttle starts at the visitor center and arrives about every 15 minutes at the 9 sites. However during the morning hours when most visitors arrive, the wait times at the visitor center can be long (one day we were in line for a shuttle for 60 minutes). Parking is another issue due to the number of visitors. The parking lot fills early at the visitor center. The town of Springdale is just outside the park and has private paid parking and free shuttles. We were able to use the shuttle that stopped near our hotel and so did not have that expense. These shuttles were also timely and allowed us to visit the local restaurants and shops. Springdale is a cute little town.The best hikes are the river walk with a hike into “The Narrows” but you should consider renting the equipment from one of the local vendors. The water shoes, socks and hiking pole made it a much more enjoyable experience.

Zion's Main Canyon,"One of several reviews related to a 20 day Grand Circle tour.For those new to Zion, be aware that use of the bus system is NOT optional (like it is in Grand Canyon or Bryce), that guests are required to park their car at the Visitor Center (or in the town of Springdale) and hop on a shuttle bus to get to one of nine stops within the canyon. If like us you visit Zion on the Sunday of Memorial weekend, you should either expect to spend 90 minutes waiting in line for a bus at the Visitor Center, or (like us) you will opt for walking along the river for a couple of stops. Either way, remain patient with your fellow travelers and know that you are in one of the most beautiful national parks in America. Oh, and if you take the time to speak with a park ranger, you will learn interesting tidbits like the fact that Memorial Day Monday has nowhere near the crowd levels encountered a mere 24 hours earlier, so this too shall pass. Take a breath, say a prayer of thanks, and enjoy the wonder that is Zion National Park.","June 22, 2018",Zion is a Unique Experience,43,"San Jose, California",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Visited in April between Spring Break and the start of summer thinking it would be less crowded. Perhaps it was less crowded but it was still very crowded. All the parking in the park were full so we had to park in town where the streets were all torn up and under construction plus parking cost $20. There is a free shuttle from town to the park visitor center then a separate shuttle from there into the main canyon areas. Towards to end of the day, these shuttle were standing room only and those waiting for a ride at stops closure to the canyon entrance were waiting for a long time because the shuttle were full by the time it reached their stop. No doubt that the scenery is amazing but if you do not like crowds, I'd come in the winter.","June 20, 2018",Amazing Site BUT Very Crowded,102,"Mesquite, Nevada",4
Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion is certainly one of our most dramatic national parks. The beautiful Zion Canyon is spectacular to view but the real experience is exploration on one of the many trails. There are trails for all skill levels. The Narrows is our favorite even if you can only venture into the cold Virgin River a short way. Angels landing is very popular but challenging. It appears many visitors are day users which tends to add to the large numbers flooding the entrance gate of the park daily. Parking is scarce in the park. There is a shuttle that runs from the town of Springdale to the visitor center. Shuttle service is operated in the park also during peak season. It's a good sevice but overwhelmed by crowds. They advertise you should wait no longer than 15 mins. The reality is they do run every 15 mins but with the crowds you will wait for 45-60 mins in the morning.The other issue we had beside navigating the crowds is there are no showers or a place to buy essentials in the park. So if you're camping, plan on a trip to town. You can take the shuttle but not if you need ice. Unfortunately, if you leave the park in your vehicle to pick up supplies you will again need to wait in line on return with those who have not already been in the park. Entrance time can be a hour. It would be helpful if they provided an entrance line for those returning.There are management issues with the park but it is still worth the trip. Just be prepared to deal with a park overwhelmed by visitors and under prepared park management.","June 14, 2018",Spectacular but be prepared....,63,"Baywood Park, California",4

Earlier spring was much more enjoyable. Come early to see the museum, ride the tram to do any hiking pints and save the drive through for mid day or early evening.

We hiked Angle’s Landing (only up to the overlook, .5 miles from the top, we didn’t do the chain part), Riverside Wall, Canyon Overlook Trail, Lower and Upper Emerald Pools, and Kayenta Trail. The best view in the park (my opinion) can be found on the Kayenta Trail between the Grotto and Lower Emerald Pool. See picture! The park can be done in as little as half a day or get out and hike several trails a day for 3-4 days. Get there early or you will wait for a shuttle for a long time. Also if you have time take a drive over the Zion-Mount Carmel Highway to see the sights on the East side of the park, drive through the tunnel and possibly see big horn sheep!

Zion's Main Canyon,"It's as beautiful as everybody says. And unlike hiking in the Appalachians, which I've done all my life, you don't have to reach the peak of a hike for a payoff. Literally 90% of any hike you do is a payoff point. ---But travelers with young families or any kind of fear of heights must understand that when you see ""moderate dropoffs"" in a hike's description, that means ""fatal dropoffs."" Sure, some of the more dangerous and difficult hikes have dropoffs of several hundred, and I think over a thousand, feet. So compared to those dropoffs, 50 and 100 cliffs might be comparatively moderate. But really, the only difference between a 500 dropoff and a 50 foot dropoff is the amount of screaming you'll do before you die. ---Along the Grotto trail, for example, numerous ""moderate"" dropoffs had us on a trail maybe three feet wide with the granite mountain on our left and a 50+ foot sheer cliff on our right. So basically, if you've never fallen off a sidewalk sober, you should be fine. But we had our two boys with us, ages 7 and 4. It was just a tad nervous making keeping our kids to the left while we negotiated these spots, some of which involved turns and making way for hikers coming in the opposite direction.","April 19, 2018",Everything is wow. Moderate means fatal.,11,"Brooklyn, New York",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Be advised that the generous amount of free parking at Zion is a thing of the past. Pay kiosks have sprouted up like mushrooms in Springdale with a cost of $22 per day. From their website “All public streets are designated paid parking, permit parking or no parking”. But guess what? There are no signs posted or red curbs painted yet to let you know that. You are expected to be a mind reader. Still they have no qualms about issuing tickets. We were fined $125 for parking within 30 ft. of an intersection. Talk about a trap! Most other states set the distance at 20 ft...30 ft is a huge distance! Save your money and time and go to one of the other parks instead. Unless you’re a serious hiker you’ll find sights that are just as amazing at any one of the other parks (don’t miss Bryce)!","April 19, 2018",Springdale Parking is a trap!,10,"Santa Rosa, California, United States",1
Zion's Main Canyon,"You need to get up early to catch the shuttle bus and even then you may have to wait for the next available one. To avoid the shuttle bus you either have to be staying at the lodge or visit between the middle of March and November when private vehicles are allowed in the main canyon. Rock walls tower over the Virgin River and you can access the easier trails like Weeping Rock, Emerald Pools or River Walk or the more challenging Angel's Landing or Observation Point with their breath taking views overlooking the main canyon.","April 15, 2018",Too Crowded to Merit a Higher Rating,164,"Calgary, Canada",4

Zion's Main Canyon,"There are only a couple of recommendations I would make... 1) figure out parking. If you are staying in Springdale, do not park at the park. Not only is it $20, but they fill up fast, so you are rushing in the morning to make sure you can get a spot... why? If you are staying in Springdale, leave your car at the hotel, and take the free Springdale Shuttle that drops you off at the mouth of the park. Most shuttle stops are within 100 yards of any hotel. They leave every 10-15 minutes. There is a good chance that the America the Beautiful National Parks Pass is a good value. For $80, you can take up to 4 people in any national park for a YEAR! The other benefit is that you don't stand in line to pay, you just walk through, flash your pass and you are in the park. Come and go as you please, and do not need to keep your receipt. Once within the park you need to take the Zion Shuttle. If there are shuttles running, there is no driving up the canyon.. period (unless you are staying or eating at Zion Lodge or camping). Zion Shuttles run 80% of the year, so chances are you will need to take the shuttle. They have several stops, so check before hand where you want to get off, or take the shuttle to the very last end, listening to the narrator, and then turn around and get off wherever you decide suits you.Pets -- there were very few trails that allowed for dogs, and there are NO pets allowed on the shuttle. So even if do you want to take the trail that allows for dogs, you need to walk to that area and then take the pet. I was surprised, so check before you go!!!Other than that, have fun.

Zion's Main Canyon,"So we drive 400 miles (entrance fees are $20) and get into the main visitor center area of the park to find every lot marked ""parking full, return to town and catch shuttle."" No mention at the gate that parking was already full or that we should u-turn and park in Springdale for a shuttle. Terrible service! We cruise the main lot to turn around and find an empty parking spot right next to the visitor center - lucky us, we thought! Then we walk in and see a line with 3-hour wait for a mandatory shuttle into the canyon. The Ranger provided us a better map of the entire park (the one at gate was just the canyon) and we saw a backcountry route from Virgin, UT up to Kolob Lake and decided to explore that alternative. We had a super fun drive, saw the tops of the beautiful peaks we would have only seen looking up from the canyon floor, such as West Temple, Tabernacle Dome, Guardian Angel, Lambs Knoll and Kolob Peak. We had a fun picnic at Kolb Lake - the lake was still frozen and snow was everywhere - a pleasant surprise at 8,107'. We saw maybe a dozen other cars on the route up and back, and felt like we had the park to ourselves, plus feeling sorry for the masses still waiting for parking or a shuttle 5,000' feet below us.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion Canyon is where the action is- it's the home of the lodge and all the famous trails and sights like Angel's Landing, The Narrows, Court of the Patriarchs and Emerald Pools (see separate reviews for these points of interest). It's an incredibly beautiful environment with sheer red-rock canyon walls towering above the picturesque Virgin River passing below. The canyon is located off Utah State Route 9 near Springdale, about 34 miles east of Interstate 15 and 23 miles west of US89 at Mount Carmel. To reach the canyon, you must enter the park via either the south or east entrance and show a pass or pay admission ($30/car, valid for 7 days). Note that if you arrive via the east entrance you will pass through a tunnel that is over a mile long and has height and width restrictions. Vehicles like RVs that are 11'4"" high by 7'10"" wide or larger require a permit and traffic control to use the tunnel (see park website and separate reviews for Zion-Mt. Carmel tunnel). The road that goes through Zion Canyon is called Zion Canyon Scenic Drive (6.1 miles one-way, see separate reviews, a.k.a. Floor of the Valley Road) and it begins at Canyon Junction about 1.5 miles north of the south entrance. During the winter the canyon is open to private passenger vehicles, but between mid-February and the end of November visitors must ride the park shuttle into the canyon unless they have reservations at the lodge. The free shuttle travels south to north between the visitor center near the south entrance and Temple of Sinawava at the north end of Zion Canyon and makes 9 stops (see park website and separate reviews for Zion Shuttle). Although the buses have glass ceilings and there is some basic narration during the shuttle ride, the focus is on transportation and it is not really a sightseeing tour. Note that there is no parking at Canyon Junction (the mouth of Zion Canyon); most of the available parking is near the south entrance at the visitor center and shuttle station. Bicycling is permitted in the canyon but cyclists must yield to the shuttle buses. Zion Canyon gets very crowded, particularly in summer. I recommend avoiding summer months and trying to arrive early in the morning on a weekday. When we visited on a Monday in mid-September, we drove to a parking lot near the Nature Center and South Campground about 8:00am and parked our car, avoiding the visitor center and shuttle station altogether. We accessed the nearby paved Pa'rus Trail (see separate reviews) and walked an easy, scenic 1.2 miles north to Canyon Junction (stop 3) to catch the shuttle into the canyon. We had to wait about 15 minutes because the first bus that passed was full. The shuttles are wheelchair accessible for standard-sized manual chairs and provide a ramp and lock-downs (if you have a very large wheelchair or scooter that may not fit on the shuttle, inquire at the visitor center or entrance gate about size limitations and passes that will permit you drive into the canyon). Once we were on board the shuttle, we rode all the way to the north end of the route at Temple of Sinawava (stop 9). We followed the Riverwalk Trail (see separate reviews) for a mile along the Virgin River to the beginning of The Narrows Trail. The trail was mostly shaded by the canyon walls in the morning and it wasn't too busy when we started but foot traffic was increasing significantly by the time we returned. We boarded the shuttle again and rode to the lodge (stop 5). We disembarked and walked across the road to the trail head for Emerald Pools (see separate reviews). We hiked the Lower Emerald Pools Trail to a small waterfall, about 1.5 miles round-trip. This trail was rated easy but was challenging for a wheelchair user with able assistance, also quite popular due to its location near the lodge. Winding up the side of a hill, it was more exposed than the Riverwalk and getting hot by mid-day. We rode the shuttle back to Canyon Junction and then walked back to our car on the Pa'rus Trail. We were in Springdale for lunch about 12:30. The only food services inside the canyon are at Zion Lodge (shuttle stop 5). Restrooms are located at Zion Lodge, The Grotto (stop 6), Weeping Rock (stop 7), and Temple of Sinawava (stop 9).","March 2, 2018",Astounding Scenery Attracts Hordes of Admirers,1781,"Tucson, Arizona",4

I have lived in Utah my entire life and had never been and decided to change that. We weren't really sure what to expect and only had the better part of a day to spend here, so we only spent time hiking the emerald pools. I can't wait to go back and tackle more areas. There are sights for all ages, too. Easier hikes if you have kids and even a trail that allows your furry friends. We were there during season, so we parked at the main station and rode the shuttle. We arrived around 7 AM and it wasn't too crowded at all. However, when we got back to the visitor center hours later, the crowd had definitely picked up. So try going earlier to beat the crowds! Bring plenty of water (I used a waterpack backpack, along with an extra bottle to refill my reservoir) and there is also water stations throughout, should you need an extra refill. There are also restrooms throughout, which was nice. Wear good hiking shoes and bring sunscreen. It's easy to spend an entire day here with multiple hikes, trails, and centers to explore.","February 10, 2018",Awesome!,43,"Provo, Utah",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"There is a simple reason Zion has become so popular. The stunning majesty of this park is difficult to describe. Words are not enough. And you only get a glimpse of its beauty in a snap shot. You need to go and visit it yourself to fully experience the dramatic splendor of this park. You are literally surrounded in beauty.This is a park everyone can enjoy. There are trails for the novice and the experienced hiker. The Riverside Walk is one everyone can do. However, we found many of the “easy trails” were still difficult for us. The trail to the Lower Emerald Pools, rated as an easy walk, had a good deal of uphill grades. So we walked slowly, took a number of breaks as needed, as was rewarded with unbelievable views! Walk a little, or walk a lot, you won’t be disappointed. The views are beautiful right from the shuttle stops driving through the park.Definitely get there early. We drove 3 hours from Las Vegas to get there about 9:30am Utah time (it’s one hour later in Utah). We were able to find parking in the park, but it was filling up fast. We waited about 20 minutes for the first shuttle, which wasn’t bad. After the initial shuttle wait, we waited no longer than 5 minutes for any of the other shuttles. Their shuttle system is excellent, free, and you can get on and off as often as you like. Do not confuse the Zion shuttle with the Springdale shuttle. The Springdale shuttle is also free, but operates outside the park in Springdale and takes you to and from the hotels and restaurants outside the park to the park entrance.Because of the popularity of this park you cannot drive through the park yourself from March through mid-November and must use the shuttle. If you visit later in the year, you can drive yourself, the temperatures are lower and the crowds are smaller. We went in mid-September and lucked out with a little cooler weather, but it can still be hot this time of year. We didn’t mind the “crowds.” We met a lot of nice people along the trails.We entered from the Springdale (south) entrance, visited the park for the day, then later when we were ready to leave we drove out to the east entrance through the tunnel to experience the Zion-Mt. Carmel Highway. This is a must do! The views from the switchbacks up the canyon were unbelievable. There are pullouts where you can park and take some incredible pictures. The tunnel was amazing. It’s over a mile long! If you want to do the Canyon Overlook Trail, just be aware that it is immediately past the tunnel exit. Park in the parking lot on the right and walk across the road to the trail entrance. There isn’t a sign for it on the right side of the road, so you can easily miss it. The views driving past the tunnel are amazing too. This was one of the most scenic drives we have taken. Then we backtracked through the park to leave out of Springdale. It was worth the extra time to see this part of the park. Don't miss it!Zion is one of the national parks that definitely belongs at the top of everyone’s bucket list.","October 13, 2017",Stunningly Beautiful Park!,322,"Buffalo, NY",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion National Park is just stunning. The views of the rock walls are really something special. I'd add a picture but there are so many pictures posted by people who went before me that mine are not needed.There are numerous hiking trails for beginners and experts. There are free shuttles that place you from one wend of the park to the other. And they run fairly often.It's only a few hours drive from Las Vegas, and if you rent a car and stay one night in the Zion Lodge. (Reserve early . . . really early . . . really really early . . . I mean like a year early if you are going in season). If you stay at the Lodge (or take an hour or 3 hour horseback ride), you'll get a red sticker that will allow you to drive to the lodge. If you do not have one, don't expect to park in the parking lot on site. You'll have to find parking in town and wait for the shuttle bus. I do not know how often those busses run.","October 9, 2017",Really Special,39,"Forest Hills, New York",5
Zion's Main Canyon,Great national park with plenty of hikes for anyone from beginner to expert. The free shuttle takes you from the parking areas to various stops throughout the park.

Zion's Main Canyon,"If you ever want an easy day in the canyon, I would strongly urge you to consider renting bikes and biking the canyon. It is *so* much nicer seeing the canyon from bikes than from the shuttle busses. Ride the Pa'rus trail then on to the canyon road. Although you need to pull off the road when shuttle buses come by, I never found it to be a problem. Consider stopping at the Zion Lodge for lunch on the way back down the canyon and hang out on the grass in front of the lodge.","October 2, 2017",Biking the canyon,3,"Acton, Massachusetts",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"My wife and I visited Zion as the first stop on a tour of Utah. The Zion canyon is only accessible by NPS shuttle (free) during the time we were there in September. The shuttle runs very well and we did not feel any inconvenience in using it. There are lots of hiking trails of varying difficulty in the canyon. We particularly enjoyed the river walk at the upper end of the canyon for the scenic views and lots of wildlife (deer, turkeys, squirrels). We also enjoyed the hikes to the Weeping Cave and the Emerald Pools. One note, the shuttle line at the visitor center can get long by mid-morning. It is advised to get there early to best enjoy the canyon with good photographic light. We were told that catching a shuttle going out of the canyon after 2:00 PM can be difficult as that is when most visitors are leaving.","September 23, 2017",Worth a visit,68,"Wake Forest, North Carolina",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"There's a reason Zion is one of the Big Five. It's one of those places you cannot believe what you're looking at. Do note that because it's a big name park and very close to St. George (45 minutes) it can get crowded easily so I suggest arriving early. If you get there early you can park at the visitor center and do the Watchmen Hike which was my favorite. Also, it is a $30 entrance fee so this is a good place to consider the annual park pass.","September 22, 2017",Worth its Hype,235,"Durham, North Carolina",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"I was last in Zion in 1969. The shuttle was a new experience for me and I was skeptical. Park at the Visitors Center if you can get there by 9:00 am or so - after that it will be full and you'll need to park in town at your hotel and take the Springdale shuttle to the visitors center. Once on board the free Zion shuttle it's smooth sailing. It has 9 stops up the canyon and it's hop on - hop off. Easy access to all of the trail heads, and good access to photo ops. Takes about 45 minutes from visitors center to farthest stop and same for return. Only had to wait 10 minutes at most for a shuttle. We were there from 8:30 am until Noon on a Tuesday in mid-September. Relax, it's easy.","September 12, 2017",Shuttle is surprisingly smooth,76,"Nineveh, Indiana",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Hello, we took the Shuttle first and then got in the car and drove the incredibly beautiful 13 mile drive to north park exit. We were able to find a parking spot in the visitors lot at about 8:30. You could park in Springdale, do the shuttle from there into the park and then go back, pick up your car and drive back into the park.The passenger on the 13 mile drive will have the best views....driver will be focused on the curvy road...but there are lots of places to pull off for pictures.We are 71 year olds. Advice for taking the Canyon shuttle is to get a seat on the Shuttle at the visitor center and stay on until the last stop. Standing on the shuttle is pretty shaky. At the last of 8 stops there is an easy paved 2 mile round trip walk that is up close and personal with a stream on one side and sheer 300 to 500 foot cliffs straight up from the sidewalk. Then take the shuttle back that is much less crowded and stop where you want on the return trip. For seniors, in my opinion, the last stop is the highlight of the shuttle stops by far. Others appear to be more jumping off points for long hikes.We loved it...it was REALLY hot though by 3:00 on September 11...like 98!Have fun.","September 11, 2017","Absolutely Do the park shuttle, but do not miss the 13 mile self drive that climbs the cliffs.",4,"Iowa City, Iowa",5

The beauty of this park is incredible. It's hard to catch it on camera because the mountains are right up to the road. It feels almost like being in a church, it is so ethereal.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We took a leisurely road trip across country to the Grand Canyon and continued on, deciding to visit Utah since we were so close. We are so glad we did! ZIon is absolutely beautiful, quiet and laid back National Park. We picked up sandwiches at a deli in Springdale, hiked the trail along the Virgin River and ate our lunch in the peaceful wilderness. Being seniors, we did not make it all the way to the Narrow, but the trails are mostly easy to moderate and we were able to do several trails in one full day in the park. The shuttle takes you to the top of the canyon and just riding the shuttle provides gorgeous views of the canyon. We were there in Early June and the crowds were moderate. We easily found a place to park in Springdale. You can catch the shuttle from there to the park entrance and the board the shuttle up the canyon. The busiest crowds were there at the entrance. Once we got on the shuttle and moved up the canyon, the crowds dispersed nicely. We drove thur the park the next day on our way to Bryce and the drive was gorgeous! we went thru the old tunnels that were blasted thru the mountains when the park was opened. We loved the park and have highly recommended to friends and family.","August 16, 2017",Breathtaking National Park!!,9,"Annandale, Virginia",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"Amazing park – as expected for the national parks. Bu this park is extremely crowded – over crowded in fact. There is very limited parking, so shuttle buses are a must if you are not staying within walking distance to the park (we walked form the Cliffrose). Even walking over, the line to get in snakes all through the welcome area and it took an hour to actually get into the park. Please note – you cannot walk into the park itself. You can only walk into the reception area. All visitors must enter the park via shuttle bus. So if you’re in a group, send one person to the visitor’s center to chat with rangers, gather maps, use a restroom, and refill your water bottles. (Bring a refillable water bottle. There are water stations everywhere!). Buses ran smoothly and frequently. Drivers were great – giving you history of park and making sure all guests’ needs were met – especially those with strollers (bring the smallest version of a stroller that you have), those with mobility impairments, etc. Camping sites are booked far, far in advance. The main section of the park where shuttles run is not as big as you would think – but it’s pure splendor. To explore other parts of the park you will need a car. Please note if you want to drive to Kanab, Bryce or other points and you are driving the Zion/ Mt. Carmel Parkway, you should buy a yearly parks pass. Every time you pass through the parks on foot or by vehicle the charge will be $15 per person or $30 per vehicle. So for $80 a yearly pass is a bargain.About those other sections of the park – GO! They are less crowded, offering some amazing views and hiking trails. The highway that leads to Bryce is magnificent – hairpin turns, stone tunnels, one way tunnels, overlooks, more wildlife and big horn sheep, checkerboard mesa and more.","July 30, 2017",A must visit section of Zion - but go farther afield too!,232,"Vienna, Virginia",5

We referred to it as the Disney World of national parks. There are lines everywhere for everything. We arrived mid morning on a Thursday and were told the visitor center parking lot was full. Well we were on a motorcycle so we went anyway and we were able to find a spot sharing it with another motorcycle. But there were no spots for cars. We waited in line about 30 minutes or so for a shuttle. We stopped at the lodge to try and get a quick snack....hoards of people. We got on another shuttle. They do come around really quickly so that didn't take long. We rode to the end of the line and did the Riverside Walk. Again masses of people! I'm not kidding at all. It was basically a line of people going in each direction. People right in front of you and right behind you.

Zion's Main Canyon,"The main canyon area in Zion is situated between Canyon Junction and the Temple of Sinawava. Here the Virgin Rivers runs deep between the towering canyon walls, creating a remarkable area to explore by way of the Scenic Drive and numerous trails. There are fantastic viewpoints throughout the canyon floor. We particularly enjoyed the Court of the Patriarchs and the views from the Weeping Rock stop as well. Even better are elevated views from locations such as the Angel's Landing viewpoints. Peering down into the canyon provides fantastics scenes of outdoor grandeur. There is a Scenic Route which travels long the Virgin River and along the walls of the canyon. Visitors can make use of a free shuttle service on a hop-on, hop-off basis allowing you to visit various areas of interest through the canyon. During much of the year the road is only accessible by way of the free shuttle so plan on making use of it during your visit. In the end, this is a truly beautiful area of Zion National Park to spend time. Several days exploring the canyon floor and various hikes is not too much if you enjoy the outdoors and scenic places. Just note that this is an incredibly popular national park so just be ready to share the park with many other visitors.","June 27, 2017","Remarkable beauty in all directions, great hikes and viewpoints",18552,"Hong Kong, China",5

People are crowding to climb a Scout Landing or walk the River Walk.For some reason just a few people hike along the river in the Main Canyon. (In Bryce it's another way around!!! Very few people on the gorgeous Rim Trail) Everybody in Zion is taking a shuttle. In the shuttle you miss 99% (literally) of the scenery. I can add, that it's a very easy in one level hike. sometimes you need to jump over the water if you want to stay all the time close to the river.

You will skirt the Virgin River as you walk the valley floor. TIP: I got the most incredible pictures of the park on the bus! Upon returning to the visitor center, try and sit on the right (passenger) side of the bus. Windows do open for clear shots, and I got a much better perspective of the park while driving the Scenic Drive Road. I feel the BEST part of Zion is when you take Hwy 9, Zion - Mt. Carmel Highway.

Zion's Main Canyon,"This is one of the many beautiful National Parks in Utah, and perhaps the crown jewel of them all. I thought it was one of the most beautiful parks I have been to in all 50 states.The park is basically divided into four large areas: Kolob Canyons and the accompanying visitors center just off I-15 in the northwest corner of the park, Kolob Terrace Road leading to Kolob Reservoir, Zion-Mount Carmel Hwy 9 from the south entrance to the east entrance, and of course the most visited area of the park which is the main canyon and only accessible by shuttle unless you are staying at the Zion Lodge.I was a little hesitant about using the shuttle service fearing packed shuttles. You can drive your car to the Zion Canyon Visitors Center or take a shuttle from any of the hotels in Springdale. We drove to the Zion Canyon Visitors Center arriving at about 6:45 A.M. and caught the first "" up canyon "" shuttle at 7:00 A.M. We took this all the way to the last stop which was the Temple of Sinawava. We walked the paved path to the beginning of the Narrows. Then we caught the shuttle back to the visitors center stopping at each individual stop. This worked quite well and we avoided the large crowds in the afternoon. By the time we left the park at 4:00 P.M. it was unbelievably crowded despite it being a Monday in the middle of Oct.The Zion - Mount Carmel Hwy drive is quite spectacular and should be done in both directions if at all possible.The hiking opportunities are unlimited in the park and it is easy to get away from the large crowds when you travel or hike in the Kolob Canyons area or the Kolob Terrace Road / Kolob Reservoir area.If you are a hiker you could spend weeks in this park. Of course the most talked about hikes are the Narrows and Angels Landing. The Angels Landing hike is the most strenuous and not to be attempted by anyone who is not in good physical condition. The Narrows is less strenuous but can be difficult depending on how far up the Narrows you hike, and the water conditions.This is one of the most visited National Parks in the country and should be on any park enthusiast bucket list of parks to visit.Try to spend at least two days in this park, and more if possible.","November 15, 2016",A Spectacularly Beautiful Park,259,"Memphis, Tennessee",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"Just visited the park with my family, end of October. We had only few hours time to spend there. Drive up and down the canyon in our car was great to have an idea how beautiful this place is, plus we saw some wild life on our way, like goats and a deer. Then we took a shuttle and stopped at few places that don't ask for a long hike. We got from point 3 to point 4 where we did again some small hiking which was scenic. After we took a shuttle to get to the Narrows, it was an hour round trip walking from the bus stop. It was absolutely beautiful! I wish to go back there soon and do some more hiking and go to Angel's landing and do the whole hiking in The Narrows. For that you have to rent water shoes or bring your own and count extra hours.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion, despite it's modest size, is now (according to a recent National Geographic article) the 6th most visited park in the entire system. And the breathtaking canyon is the epicenter of the traffic. Two suggestions...arriving early in the morning will ensure you get a precious parking space at the Visitor Center and minimize the wait for the incomparably efficient shuttle bus service (no passenger cars are allowed in this section of Zion) and don't forget to explore the more remote and exponentially less visited area of Kolob Canyon to the north. Unlike the Grand Canyon whose visual impact is it's sheer immensity, this sandstone sanctuary offers a far more intimate experience - just remember that the early bird catches the worm!","November 2, 2016",Spectacular but very crowded,12,New Bedford MA,5
Zion's Main Canyon,The word awesome is so misused now that it good to use it in its correct meaning. We spent a day here at the end of September and the sheer beauty of the place could move you to tears. We parked just outside the park and used the shuttles both to get to the park and to ride up and down the canyon. The shuttle system is frequent and very efficient. We got off and on at most stops but didn't do any of the trails as we are both well into our senior years! We did walk as far as the entry to the Narrows and many years ago we would have been tempted to go further.

Realy makes a huge difference!","October 29, 2016",Really amazing!,78,"West Islip, New York",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"It’s a long drive into the park, but well worth it. We passed a buffalo herd as we drove several miles to the park entrance. It’s another 3 or 4 mile drive to the fee booth after entering the park, then a 10-mile drive to the lodge, with an inevitable wait at the mile-long tunnel. So plan on a half hour to actually get in and out of the park. But all worth it as the sheer-cliff rock formations are spectacular.

Zion's Main Canyon,"I know that it's not exactly a ""secret""...there were a LOT of people in the park the week we were there. But, I have read quite a bit about our country's National Parks and southern Utah is not one that has really registered on our radar until now. We had a wonderful time experiencing The Narrows, Angel's Landing, a picnic with wild turkeys at the Grotto, hiking the Emerald Pools, and using the wonderful shuttle system. The park was beautiful, clean, filled with staff who seem to love their jobs, and the town of Springdale at the entrance is a jewel.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We just arrived home from a wonderful trip to Zion. Our two favorite activities were hiking the Narrows and biking up to the Temple of Sinawava and back. We decided to rent pants, boots and socks for the hike. I simply couldn't believe that I wouldn't feel the cold 50 degree water with this equipment, but it was true! I was comfortable the entire hike. We went up the canyon about 2 hours and then turned around. One of the best hikes I have ever done (and I have done a lot). We rented from Zion Mountain rentals. They were very professional and efficient. Biking the second day was an epic experience. We kept wondering why more people weren't doing it. The road was all ours (and the shuttle busses on occasion). Around every corner were jaw-dropping vistas. We chose to do this instead of Angel's landing. I know that is a wonderful hike, but we had done it on a previous trip. ","October 12, 2016",Trip to Zion,8,California,5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Some of the locations in southern Utah are locked away for those who can carry a backpack, hike or climb. The main canyon of Zion National park allows for visitors who might be less physically inclined to see some of the most beautiful and stunning views from roadside turnouts. There is definitely more to Zion than what you can see from the Main Canyon, but especially if you arrive later in the day, I would recommend keeping an eye on the sky, if it is relatively clear, remember that photographs of the canyon will be more interesting in the late afternoon with the sun hitting it at an angle (same is true in the early mornings near to sunrise.)","October 12, 2016",A eye-popping drive through some of God's most outstanding sights and views,15,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"My wife and I spent a day here and felt like we just scratched the surface of what there is to see. If you are mobility limited you can take the shuttle around the park and catch the views, getting off at a number of stops to take in the grandeur of the scenery from the roadside.If you want to hike, there are 15 to 20 different paths you can take of various levels of difficulty. Be sure to see the park newspaper for a description of each hike including its level of difficulty and the elevation change involved.You can also talk to the rangers in the visitor center to discuss what would be appropriate for your specific circumstance. The earlier in the day you arrive, the more you will be able to see and do. Bring a picnic lunch, or eat at the snack bar or restaurant at the Zion Lodge stop.While you get some narration on the shuttle bus, you might want to catch a ranger talk, or tour, to get a deeper understanding of the park. The movie does give some overview of the park, but I thought it could have been much more informative.","October 10, 2016",Majestic Beauty,224,"Dunedin, Florida",5

The combination of high peeks, steep cliffs, reddish tint and green vegetation was a treat for the eye. We hiked a few trails during our stay but we loved the west rim trail leading to angels landing. It gave a good impression of the valley and was exciting at some points. Also the shuttle drivers were quite amusing, I like to believe some of them are comedians in their free time. I highly recommend visiting.

Hint #4: Make campground reservation at Zion Canyon Campground on Jan 1st. Ask for a ""River spot."" You will get it.Hint#5: Rent a bike at the shuttle drop off just south of the Visitor Center ($5 for five hours) and ride the bike trail to the lodge. From then on there are no cars.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We are in our late 60's and are planning to visit the major NP's in Utah on this road trip. We stayed in Mesquite, NV as our base for this leg of the trip. It is a nice place since it is centrally-located for travel to Zion, Vegas, Hoover Dam. We also spent a day in Snow Canyon State park. We left early from Mesquite (it is an hour earlier there than Zion) and arrived in Zion around 9AM. We saw signs that the parking was full and we should park in Springdale to take the shuttle. Well, we saw all the crowds at the shuttle stops in Springdale, and wondered if the first part of our trip would entail looking for parking. We got through the park entrance pretty quickly (our NP passport got us in for free). We drove past the Visitor's Center and the Museum (which I think was closed), looking for 'the parking lot'. Well, there doesn't seem to be a parking lot beyond the Visitor's Center. We got on to Hwy 9 which leads through the plateau region of the park, and I made the decision to pull off the road and park next to cars that were already there....good decision. Shuttle stop 3 (Canyon Junction) was a short walk away. We were lucky and got our camera equipment out, walking stick, daypack with water and sandwiches. We started by taking the shuttle to Stop 4, Court of the Patriarchs. A friend took a fantastic photo from this area, and we have a print of it on our wall. I found the exact spot where he took the photo and tried to duplicate it, with the large cottonwoods in the foreground and soaring rock walls behind. The Virgin river flows through this area and we saw some wild turkeys. We were the only ones on this trail. Continued our shuttle to the end of the Canyon (Stop 9, The Temple of Sinawava). This area was more crowded, as many were on their way to hike the narrows. The paved trail to that junction was about a mile long, one way. It was very easy, and full of great vistas of the canyon walls. We saw elk and deer, and plenty of squirrels. There were many places to get river access. A photo tip: If you want to capture the detail of shadows and highlights in your photos, then try shooting HDR, or at least shoot RAW images. I carried my tripod and was glad I did for this section of the park. There was such a mix of lighting, from full sun to deep shade. I had a great time with my camera. We took the shuttle back to Stop 5 (Zion Lodge), had our lunch, a great latte, and refilled our water bottles with the fresh-tasting Zion water. We took the Shuttle back to Stop 3 and unloaded our packs and tripod, then continued on the shuttle to the Visitor's center. While my spouse shopped the gift store, I took my camera down to the river shore and captured a group of mule deer crossing the river and grazing on the banks just 10 yards away from me. We finished our day by walking the paved Pa'rus Trail 1.7 miles to Canyon Junction. This is a wide trail that takes you along the Virgin River on flat terrain, where you have the Zion rock formations all around you. We were in the open sun for most of this trail, and I didn't need the tripod. Another tip: use a polarizing filter on sunny days. So glad I had one on my 15-135mm zoom. Earlier in the day I used my 17-55mm f 2.8, and my 10-22mm wide angle. Wide angle lenses are needed especially in the narrow canyon areas. I did not need my 100-400mm lens on this day. It would have been nice on the Pa'rus trail, and maybe next time I'll use it; because, there will be a 'next time' for us, as I really enjoyed this trip to Zion. In a few days, we will travel the plateau section of the park, and I will write a review on this.","September 28, 2016",So much to see and absorb; the experience will stay with you.,78,"Midland, Michigan",5

There are other, more challenging options for those who want them. We stayed in Springdale having come in from the east on Highway 9 through the park. With all that traffic and winding roads, we were anxious about what our visit would be like. We were pleasantly surprised to learn the town has a free shuttle to the park that runs a very accommodating schedule. At the park, the park shuttles take over to take you to the restricted part of the park (private vehicles restricted unless staying at the Zion Lodge). The traffic and parking at the or near the visitor's center can be a nightmare so park in Springdale and use the free shuttle! Once inside, the stops for overviews and the easy hiking opportunities are plentiful. Follow the park map, take plenty of water and match the multitude of trails to your ability. We live near the Smokies, and this park rivals those mountains for beauty.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Drove here from Las Vegas which took about a couple of hours including stops. Like any national park around the US, an entrance fee is charged per car depending on the size. Regular ones at $30 with complimentary maps, info, brochure. There are designated parking areas that easily fill-up so try to go early. Once parked, try to get on to a shuttle bus that goes around the entire park stopping at every point- 9 total. A voice recording plays inside the bus giving info on the scenery and stops. You can alight at any stop to take fotos, hike, eat, take a restroom break, etc. and hop on to the next shuttle which leaves every 10 minutes the whole day. Last trip I heard is at 9pm. If you are into walking, trekking, hiking, mountain climbing, rock climbing, rappelling, or love the outdoors, then this is definitely for you. But come prepared especially during summer when temperature reaches up to past hundreds Fahrenheit (109deg). Coming from the tropics, I am not used to the hot, dry desert weather. I can stand hot & humid because perhaps I'm used to it but the dry, hot air kills me. Short of saying I stayed inside the bus the whole time. I did not enjoy this attraction as much mainly because of this plus I've already seen the Grand Canyons and Sedona which is quite similar. It might seem unfair to give this a low rating but it is what it is. Had I came in more suitable conditions, then I would have enjoyed it more because I really love the outdoors. I would have liked seeing the Narrows or climbing on the edge of the cliffs if I were more prepared. Sadly, this will be on my ""been there, done that"" list.

Took the shuttle back to the Lodge for lunch. This place had pizza, salads, burgers; it was clean, had decent price and polite service. I was impressed to find such a place in the middle of the canyon. Next we went to the Weeping rock which was also unbelievably beautiful. After that we took the shuttle to the end and did the Riverwalk trail, amazing. We didn't know to take with us water shoes to do the Narrows at the end but we were already tired anyway, maybe other time. The roads inside the canyon are perfectly kept, same as the shuttle buses. Almost all stops have maps, signs, benches, restrooms, drinking water to refill your bottles. The staff service was great.

The Park needs to add shuttles and other strategies that will allow people to enjoy the park without waiting and struggling even on the trails behind groups of people.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Beautiful place to spend our 4 days. Great shuttle system. At the suggestion of another poster took the shuttle all the way back then worked our way to the visitor center over the 4 day period. Then you don't have to ride the shuttle over the same stops again and again. If your there just for the day not that big of deal. Took several trails and saw mountain climbers and kayakers. We stayed at one of the campgrounds in the park and did not have the hassle of parking which seemed to be full late morning. We drove in from both the east and the west entrances and the east entrance sets the stage for what you are about to see during your stay at Zion much better then the west, it takes your breath away going through the tunnel and the decline into the canyon. I would recommend if you come in from the west to check out the east entrance, but it does get very busy so do it early. Really enjoyed the trails and there are water refill stations thru most of the park. You have to go to Zion if you ever get the chance.","June 9, 2016",WOW!!!,47,"Algona, Iowa",5

Get in the park as early as you can to beat the crowds. Hike in the morning and do the Narrows in the afternoon heat. Take your time, some of our best times were slowly walking the paths along the river. The attractions have been there a million years, they aren't going anywhere while you take it all in.Allow at least a couple of days, more if you plan on the longer hikes.","June 8, 2016",Awesome place,14,"Spokane Valley, Washington",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"We were driving through Utah to see the many National Parks. For our Zion stop, we rented a house in Kanab and intended to just drive through the main canyon. Well, you can't. During busy summer or Spring Break days, the highway into Zion is bumper-to-bumper and when you finally get there, you can either park at the History museum or the Visitor's center UNLESS you are a guest at the Zion Lodge, in which case you are allowed to park there. They give their guests an Exclusive red pass - only red pass vehicles are allowed to go north past the history museum. Everyone else has to take the Shuttle bus. One of the days we were there it took 30+ minutes to find a parking place at the Visitor's Center, and the line for the shuttle buses wound through the entire Visitor's Center compound - the line was literally over 100 yards long (91.44 m). So get to the Visitor's Center early. There are lots of awesome places to re-fill your camel back, which you should bring. It gets hot and dry in the canyon sometimes. But I wish we had rented a dry-suit in Kanab and gone walking up the Narrows - super cool. Maybe next time.","June 4, 2016",Can't Just Drive up the Canyon,235,"Palmdale, California",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"I was a little confused why this is a separate attraction to review, because Zion National Park makes up so many trails involving this main canyon. But as a whole the canyon really is breathtaking. The shuttle service is really well thought through and takes you through the canyon for 45 minutes so you can see all the curves along the Virgin River. You really do need to take the time to look up and stand in awe of it all.","May 31, 2016",Beautiful Canyon,52,"Austin, Texas",4

Zion's Main Canyon,"First, let me just say that Zion National park was my most favorite (even after visiting Bryce Canyon, Red Rock, Valley of Fire, and Mount Charleston). First we drove the Zion-Mount Carmel Highway through Zion as we came from the opposite end after visiting Bryce Canyon. Luckily for us, we were able to find parking at the Visitor's Center easy enough in the afternoon and we used the free shuttle to get around the canyon. With all the trees, the colors of the canyon walls, and the rivers/streams, it is just a stunning and quite place. As we got there later in the day, we didn't have time to take one of the longer trails, but we did walk a few smaller ones: The Grotto and the Emerald Pools trails. While we did not get to the end of the Emerald Pools trail, we were able to see the waterfall from a distance. I'm not an experienced hiker, but I thought the hike was rather easy. It does gain some altitude, but it's very gentle and barely noticeable (but like I said, I only went halfway through the trail). It is a beautiful trail and I would highly recommend it. Keep an eye out for wildlife as they are spotted throughout the canyon (we mostly saw deer and chipmunks/squirrels). The orange colors of the canyon walls really brings out the colors in the trees, so a visit to Zion would make for some very striking pictures. Also I should mention...the small town of Springdale, outside of Zion, is incredibly charming and beautiful. I could definitely see myself living there. ;-)","May 24, 2016",One of My Favorite Places!,12,"Gainesville, Florida",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"A visit to Zion should be on everyone's bucket list. This place is jaw-droppingly, amazingly, gloriously beautiful. It has to be seen in person since pictures don't do it justice.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Stayed in Springdale and had a great room and food while there. Park is obviously beautiful and provides hikes for all skill levels. We did Emerald Pools (all pools), Hidden Canyon and Angel's landing to name a few. Angel's landing is the most unique hike I've ever done but I'd recommend researching it before going. The downside is that this is the busiest park I've ever been to. There is typically no parking available after 9 or 10 AM. We knew this and took the shuttle which was conveient from where we stayed but after 6 hours of hiking it was a little frustrating to have to take a 45 minute ride to our hotel less than 10 miles away. Easy trails are packed with families and young children not adhering to explicit directions from the park service. If you enjoy challenging, unique hikes and beautiful views you can't miss this park but plan very carefully what time of year you go and where you stay.

And we saw wild turkeys in the snow on Thanksgiving day! We stayed one night at the Hampton inn and I wished we stayed there the whole time. The shuttles run so frequently, the value for the hotel is great, and we preferred to eat in town vs the lodge. The Zion lodge was fun. Pretty well kept up for a zanterra hotel and convenient to be in the park. One still has to take the shuttle to the main trail heads. Save some money and stay at the Hampton inn.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Massive areas to walk trails, ride the tram around the park, and look up at the rock formations. The Tram (by the Lodge) runs around the main areas of the park. You might want to ride the tram as a first thing after getting to the Lodge (or by Main) area so that you get an overview of the various parts of the park. It is a great way to get a feel for where you might want to devote your time.If you have also visited Bryce Canyon, there is a comparison to make between Bryce and being here in Zion. Think of Bryce Canyon National Park as “looking down” at Nature’s beauty, whereas when in Zion, think of Zion as “looking up” and around. Both are beautiful. Both are nearby each other. And thus, it makes for a great combo of visits over a few days being done, back to back. There is a long drive into and through Zion park. The views before and as you leave the tunnel are awesome. At times the road is very windy with some breath taking images. Be careful not to run off of the road. There are several pull offs to consider, depending on the traffic.Just remember that the trail to the falls (by the Lodge) is a long walk and could take an hour or more each way. There is lots to see (deer, other animals, rocks and other fauna) along the way.Zion is a great place to lose yourself for a day or two. Enjoy.","December 27, 2015",One of Our Favorite National Parks,78,"Port Jefferson Station, New York",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"This place was absolutely stunning. We left Vegas at 6 AM in order to be there on the earlier side. When you first arrived there is a fee per car of $30. The drive from Vegas takes approximately three hours. As a reminder, when factoring in the time, the park is in the mountain time zone.The ride from Vegas for the most part is flat through Nevada and Arizona. It is not terrible to do during the day in terms of heights and roads being difficult to drive.The entrance near Hurricane, Utah has two main roads. During the peak season, you are not allowed to drive on the roads. Instead, you must take the tram. We went the day after Christmas and were able to drive on the roads ourselves. We actually preferred this because were able to stop at various points and take pictures without feeling rushed of the time constraints of getting on and off the tram. The scenery is absolutely gorgeous. We have been to many national parks and this ranks up near the top. There are several hiking locations throughout the park. While there, very few were open due to the snow. The one trail that we did today which was the river trail did have several icy patches. If you were going to hike, remember to take lots of water and warm clothing in the winter because it gets down to below freezing routinely.I cannot say enough eyes to how majestic this place is. If you have the opportunity to drive, it is well worth the six hours round-trip. If you have more time on your hands, two days would be preferable but not required.

We drove through in our car instead of the shuttle, so we were not able to see the parts where only the shuttles can drive, but from what I saw, I was blown away. I loved the tunnel we drove through that was carved through the mountain many years ago. So fun! It was a mile long! We stopped several times along the way and back, spotting several wildlife, mule deer which are common, and big horned sheep, which are uncommon. There was quite a few of them! It was amazing to see some of them up on the steep cliffs, trying to come down. Wow! We hiked a trail just outside of the tunnel which was beautiful. I would love to go there again and explore the forest trails along the Virgin River. The river flows to the Emerald Pools, which have waterfalls and a hanging garden.

Zion's Main Canyon,"I have been to Zion 3 times now during spring, winter and the fall. Each time was a beautiful and different experience. There is something for everyone at Zion. Whether you are an avid hiker or someone who likes to just take in the views - you won't be disappointed. My last trip was a few ago, Thanksgiving weekend. We went on Black Friday and the shuttles were running. The shuttles run often and make visiting the park a lot nicer than having to drive your car around to each location. There are 8 stops within the park. You will want to get out and at least take some pictures at each one of them. If you like to hike you will have plenty to explore. My only suggestion would be to pack some snacks. The lodge is pretty disappointing if you want to have lunch there. The only thing on the menu is pizza and pretzels. There is a restaurant but it's very expensive. I overheard people talking who were staying at the lodge inside the park say that they had to go into town everyday to eat. So much for convenience. The lodge inside Zion is overpriced and nothing special. You are better off staying outside the park. There are shuttles that will take you from the hotel into the park. If you do decide to drive in, you can park at the visitors center. When we went there were signs that said parking was full and to park in town. The fact that these signs were stationary and never changed was a bit suspicious to us so we took a chance and found parking easily in the visitors center.","December 12, 2015",Beautiful Park,3,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5

The difference, I think, is that one looks up at the magnificent red rock cliffs of Zion while one usually (unless you hike or ride mules to Phantom Ranch on the floor of the Grand Canyon) you look down, way down, into the Grand Canyon.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Make sure to plan for lots of time spent at this park. We only had a day, and it wasn't nearly enough. We did the Angel's Landing hike early in the day. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to climb the last half mile, which is very steep (it has chains for you to pull yourself up). The chipmunks were definitely aggressive - keep an eye on your pack and don't set your sandwich down! In the afternoon we hiked The Narrows. We had rented gear in the morning, because the hike is literally up a river. Beautiful doesn't begin to cover it. Step carefully and make sure you have a walking stick. I recommend planning an entire day for each of these. Worth every minute.","November 15, 2015",Gorgeous!,2,"Chicago, Illinois",5

Walking the trails, riding the shuttle bus, and going to the edge of the Narrows gives an indescribable view looking up from the canyon.Leaving the next day we drove through the park heading east to connect down to Arizona and it was incredible - especially through the tunnel cut through one of the mountains in 1930!","November 11, 2015",WOW!,3,"Orlando, Florida",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"The cost for motor vehicle entry to the park is $30 - The ticket is valid for 7 days . The park is located approx. 1 hour south of Cedar City. Due to limited time we entered the park at 4pm in the afternoon. A road weaves around the canyon for many miles. There are multiple places to stop for pictures or to take walks to the peaks or other areas. During the drive, the road passes through a 1600m tunnel through one of the mountains. Due to limited capacity in the tunnel, we had to stop at the entry to the tunnel for 10minutes. All in all the park is beautiful and well worth the visit. Take advantage of the 7 day pass and make return a return trip if required. We just ran out of time but wanted to squeeze it in to an afternoon.","November 8, 2015",Impressive,19,"Brisbane, Australia",4

This seems to be the best way to get around in the park. Parking is limited to 400 parking stalls and fills up by early morning If you like the out doors this is the place the trails are marked out very well and easy to find. The bus drivers are very helpful and point you in the right direction. You can get a trail book at the information desk. we found time allowed in the book was more then enough time.

Zion's Main Canyon,"This park is excellent. The views are beautiful and you can get up close the sides of the canyon, walk to the top edge and wade through the river. Although the park can get very busy, there are many walks and side paths you can take to get away from people. Throughout the day the colours change as the sun moves and xasts different shadows. There are a wide variety of different rock structures to see. It is best if you are moderately fit and can walk a good distance. This will mwan you see more and can avoid the rush at different locations. However, its possible to see lots of things even if you are not so fit. Begin your day early in the morning with a hike to angels landing. Its worth walking up even if you don't do the last section. Walk up the river if it is safe and find a place you feel most alone. The emerald falls are lovely too and an icecream or coffee in the restaurant is pretty good too. ","November 2, 2015",So Good!,36,"Launceston, Australia",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Our third trip and we loved it. This time we did the Canyon Overlook, which is just thru the tunnel on the Zion-Mt. Carmel highway. A short hike but a lot of variety and great canyon view payoff at the end. If you go early, you should see Mountain Goats. We also did the Watchman trail, which ends at a neat plateau that overlooks the lower part of the valley. It was too late to go all the way up the Angels Landing, but we made it half-way and were surprised how good the trail was. Most of this lower part is paved and an easy climb. The view back towards the canyon is amazing.","November 1, 2015",Our favorite National Park for hiking.,100,"McLean, VA",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion National Park is Utah’s first National Park and is located in south western Utah about 160 miles northeast of Las Vegas, Nevada. It is also located about 300 miles south of Salt Lake City, Utah. Access to Zion Canyon is via UT 9 from Hurricane, Utah. Almost all of the attractions in this park are inside the canyon near the canyon floor. This is different than the Grand Canyon where most of the visitors and attractions are at the top of the canyon.I visited this canyon with my wife over the long Memorial Day weekend and loved this spectacular park. I have been to many of our National Parks and this is one of my favorites. The entire canyon is beautiful but I especially liked the landmarks that literally fill Zion Canyon, such as Cathedral Mountain, Temple of Sinawava and the Great White Throne. This park is also great for hiking and there are several amazing trails including The Narrows, the Watchman, and Angels Landing. We hiked several trails during this long weekend and they were all fantastic. This National park is very popular (it is the most visited Park in Utah) and is extremely crowded so you must use the Zion shuttle bus during the high season to explore it. In addition there are not a lot of parking spots near the visitor center so you will probably need to park in Springdale and then take a Springdale shuttle bus to the Park entrance. We stayed at a hotel in Springdale near the Park entrance so we could walk into the Park or wait for the shuttle (which was always full since we were one of the last bus stops). The main campground and visitor center are at the mouth of the canyon.Overall I loved this canyon and highly recommend it. The scenery and the hiking trails are first class. Also, while the scenery is great we were also lucky to see deer and a goat sitting on a rock (or maybe it was a big horn sheep). We could only see the head as we drove by it and it was sitting on a ledge about 20 feet above our car.","October 31, 2015",One of my favorite Parks,833,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"My first time to this beatiful nartioanl park. It was described by freinds as pectacular and it was. The sheer size of the mountains, the unbelievable shapes and incredible skyline make this a must see park. We hiked on one of the more challenging sections of tyhe park, up to angels landing. Incredible views all the way up and down. But you better be in shape to make this hike. Then walked up in the river at what is called the narrows. Again, incredible views but the river water was freezing. We walked in the river with our hiking shoes. Worked out OK, but it took 2 days for shoes to dry. A beautiful park and a 2 1/2 drive from Las Vegas. There are plenty of place to stay and eat in the town just below the park. Weather was perfect.","October 30, 2015",Breathtaking views,131,"El Segundo, California",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"How can I describe Zion Canyon..? It is as if somebody painted the most beautiful place ever, and then made it real. This is possibly the most picturesque place we have visited. The shuttle bus system makes it easy to get around and there are plenty of trails and hikes for all levels of ability, from a nice stroll along the Virgin River to the daredevil clamber to the summit of the Angel's Landing trail. The higher you go, the better the views. We visited Zion National Park in late September so not too busy and all of our hikes were relatively peaceful.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Here's a GREAT, fun bike ride to do from March-October when the shuttles are running. Park at the visitors center & load your bike on the shuttle (each shuttle has room for 3 bikes on the front. Ride up on the shuttle to the last stop (Temple of Sinawava), unload & literally just cruise downhill all the way back to the visitors center. The main canyon road is closed to vehicles except those shuttle buses & a few red permit cars staying at the lodge...so you basically have the road to yourself, just pulling over when a shuttle comes by. Incredible scenery, stop along the way & watch rock climbers, enjoy a nice lunch at the Zion Lodge....at the end of the canyon road, pick up a paved bike/hiking trail that runs along the river & goes thru the campground to the visitors center, so you never have to ride on a road with traffic. We visited Zion this spring & didn't know about this so we left our bikes where we were staying just outside the park.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Try to pick a less traveled trail once you depart the shuttle bus (hidden canyon or Observation point). Most of the easy trails are close enough to the road so that you hear the tour buses (one every 4 minutes) roar past, and have enough hikers so that you need to wait in line at the most scenic overlooks along the trails. If you want to experience the magic the park has, hike away from the drive along the tunnel road, or go up to the Kolob section. The park is super special, but you will have to work at that if you only do this section.","October 27, 2015",Great views,94,"Clarksville, Maryland, United States",4

Zion's Main Canyon,"We visited Oct 14 & 15, 2015. This park provides spectacular scenery in the main canyon. The day we arrived, we rode the park shuttle round trip to Temple of Sinawava in the main canyon from the Visitors Center (highly recommended). The 2nd day, we started early (8 am) and hiked the Riverside trail (Temple of Sinawava stop, easy), Weeping Rock trail (Weeping Rock Trail, easy) & Hidden Canyon trail (Weeping Rock stop, challenging), and Kayenta & Upper Emerald Pool trails (The Grotto stop, moderate). Hidden Canyon trial was a bit nerve racking at times (holding chains along a narrow path next to a drop-off) but the views were quite nice. We had packed a lunch to eat during the hikes. After, we stopped in at Zion Park lodge for a beer! Do wear good hiking shoes and bring water and a sun hat. Stay in Springdale and either (a) drive in early to the Visitors Center or (b) take the Springdale shuttle to the Visitors Center, to access the Park shuttle.","October 25, 2015",Spectacular scenery on a grand scale; great hikes,24,"Toronto, Canada",5

We had water bottles, but with the altitude being very high, 8700 plus feet, we were quite out of breath with the short hikes to the Narrows and Lower Emerald Pool.Zion Canyon is 229-square-mile park and 15 miles long and up to half a mile deep, that cuts through the reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone by the Virgin River.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Of course 4 days is not enough. The first day we drove the scenic 12 mile drive through the tunnel, and just got our bearings on where everything was. We stayed at the Zion Canyon RV Park, which is a nice place to stay, whether you have a motorhome or a tent. It's right along the Virgin River, and close to everything in town. We caught the shuttle to the visitor center & entrance to Zion, and then the shuttle that takes you into the park. All free. It does cost $30 to enter the park while driving your own vehicle, and that pass also is good when you to go the visitor center & use the same pass to take the shuttle to all the drop off areas. I believe if you don't get the vehicle pass for $30, (we had 4 in our car), then you have to pay $15 each to enter the park. We hiked the Riverside Walk which is the last stop on the shuttle and is also the one mile trail to the start of the Narrows. The Narrows is awesome....you are hiking most of the time in the Virgin River. It wasn't that deep this time, but I hear it can be waist deep. We only walked back about 1/2 mile as there was a flash flood warning and we didn't want to take any more chances. There were SOOOOOO many people. It's good to take a walking stick to help with balancing over the slippery rocks. The 2nd day we hiked to the lower, middle & upper Emerald Pools. Again, a really nice hike. The lower pool is a pretty easy hike....but the middle and upper be prepared to walk up lots of stairs. I highly suggest going all the way to the upper pool... it's worth it. Unfortunately, those are the only two hikes we were able to go on, but there are many many more. I will be back soon. We drove from Los Angeles area, and the drive is LONG !! Took us 10 hours to get home from Zion... due to the rain and traffic especially through Vegas and Stateline.","October 19, 2015",Amazing & awesome trip to Zion !!,22,"Los Angeles, California",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"So, yes, you kinda have to go if you're here. We prefer being outside of the national parks in Utah, riding ATVs around away from civilization. I've seen pictures of Zion that made me think I'd see something I hadn't seen before in Utah. I think those pictures must be along the Narrows only. If you go into the park with a family and just want to take some more easy hikes, then you're not going to see that special stuff. We went in October when we thought it might be less crowded. We still could not park in the lot at the Visitor Center and ended up at the end of Springdale, walking a half mile to the visitor center. We also hadn't realized ahead of time that we had no choice but to suffer the shuttle system with the rest of the tourists. Our kids aren't big hikers yet, so we just got off at Zion Lodge and walked The Grotto and the Emerald Pool trails. Really nothing to write home about. Rangers are friendly enough; this just isn't the kind of place that makes my family happy. I guess I'm glad we did it so we can say ""we have been to Zion"" but unless you want to check it off your list, if you're like us and prefer to be off the beaten path in nature without crowds, you could save your money and time.","October 15, 2015",Probably better if you haven't seen red rock Utah before,110,Colorado,3

The entry to Springfield from the East (Hwy 9 I think it is) is spectacular in itself).You'll be just outside the NPS gates. Pay your fee (or wave your ""America the Beautiful"" pass - great value) and you're into the Canyon.Get on the frequent trolley buses and head north. Most people go to the end - 25 mins or so, with multiple on/off stops - and work their way back from there.Drivers give good commentary.If you're not able to hike the trails you'll still have a great time hopping on and off the trolleys & taking pics.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We visited the zion national park on Oct 10th 2015, We drove down from las vegas, so it was noon by the time we reached. Even in oct it was almost 100F in noon. The park has a entry fee of 30$ for vehicle or 15$ per person. you can also purchase the $80 pass for all national US parks which is valid the entire year. At the visitor center, you get all the information about the trails and the routes. They have a shuttle which will take you around the park. There are water filling stations at most of the times, it is easier to carry a refilling bottle. We did the emerald pool round hike till grotto and the riverside walk hike. Riverside walk takes you where the narrows hike start. Narrows is the most coveted hike in zion and you need to wade through almost knee deep water. Many people attempt to go just 1 or 2 mile instead of the entire one to get a feel of it.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Although compact compared to some parks there is still a.lot to see and explore. The essential attractions are along the main canyon. You cannot drive beyond the car parks by the main entrance at the mouth of the canyon. There is however an excellent shuttle bus service which transports you to various points along the canyon. If your time is limited I suggest you make a plan using the excellent on line site before you visit. We only had a day so planned to get off the bus at Zion Lodge and walk the Emerald Pool Trail and come down the Kayenta Trail back to The Grotto and then pick up the bus to go to another location. In the event the weather was so hot (over40 degrees C) we managed the walk but relaxed after that and had lunch at the Lodge then took the shuttle all around the canyon, stopping and taking pictures and then getting the next shuttle.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We had one day to spend so we took the bus all the way to the end - walked up to the Narrows entrance, and then took the bus back. The plan was to stop at several of the points where the bus stopped - but as it turned out - the initial bus ride and walk to/from the Narrows entrance took a large part of the day. (we did not get a super early start). The Narrows walk was nice.Decided against Angels landing due to being in direct sunlight during what appeared to be the majority of a very strenuous hike. Did the lower Emerald Pools from the Lodge stop. Not a bad walk but the pools were disappointing. Not sure if it was lack of water or just expectations - but something we could have done without.I think to do Zion right you really need to dedicate several days and plan to do some serious hiking.","October 12, 2015",Take the bus to the end - then workyour way back,13,"Centuria, Wisconsin",4

We had checked out of our room at 11:00 a.m. and didn't have a flight home until 11:00 p.m. So it was a good time do somewhere we had never been. We chose Zion National Park. In our 2 plus hour hike, we saw a bunch of mule deer in various places, all unbothered by the presence of humans. We also crossed paths with a gopher snake, a couple of tiny lizards and one tarantula who seemed to have a good attitude. According to Zion's literature, the tarantulas are nocturnal and rarely seen, but can be spotted in late Summer into Fall. Nice!

Zion's Main Canyon,"As many times as we've been to Zion it's still exciting. As soon as we enter Springdale, the anticipation starts to grow. Springdale has definitely been growing over the years with a wider variety of shops, B&B's, accommodations and amenities. On entering Zion park the ""main events"" are immediately available. Depending on your time and what you like to do, the visitors center is on your right. Great for a restroom break, quick walk through and general info. A short drive further on your left is the human history museum. Around an hour if you watch the free 22 minute video and and read through the displays. You can get to the Visitors center and the museum in your car. If you plan to go further into the canyon you'll need to use the shuttle system - which works like a well oiled machine. The shuttle stops at the Visitor's Center as well as the museum. We find it best to get a shuttle at the Visitor's center, especially during peak times so we can get a seat. Up-Canyon starts pretty full since many people intend to go all the way up to the Temple of Sinawava stop. Cars are not allowed in the main canyon past Canyon Junction - unless you've booked rooms in the Zion Lodge. The shuttle system is awesome. Runs daily and frequently during - check the website for seasonal dates and times. It stops at a number of trail heads as well as the Zion Lodge. We've done most of the Easy and Moderate trails as well as a couple of the Strenuous trails. We find the park guide is pretty accurate and asking questions about trails at the visitor's center is helpful when in doubt.The trails are definitely one of the main events in Zion.

Zion's Main Canyon,Zion National Park is a beautiful place especially for hiking. There are different levels of trails from the easiest to the most difficult. We spent two nights in the Lodge and it wasn't enough time even for a novice like me. We went at the beginning of October so it didn't seemed too crowded.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We spent limited time here. Our trip was mainly to Las Vegas, but we wanted to see what Zion was all about and I'm so glad we did. After a day here I've discovered you may need 3 full days to get the most out of this natural wonder. I thought we'd just drive through the park and see ""stuff"" and then go on. You can't do that. During the summer months and through October I believe, you must park at the visitors center(the parking lot was completely full) or in the town of Springdale (which is where we parked). You take a free shuttle to the visitors center from Springdale. You pay to enter the park and then you can get on the shuttle to go on the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive. When you enter the park you can see why they do the shuttle, there is not enough parking for the thousands of people that are here. There is a drive that you can take called Zion Park Blvd. that switchbacks up the mountain to a tunnel that is over a mile long. This is a must! Beautiful drive and incredible rock and scenery! Back to the shuttle. The shuttle will take you on the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive. It will make stops at all the different trails with the last one being the Temple of Sinawava. This is the trail to the ""Narrows"". This is the only hike that we attempted as we found out that the Angels Landing trail was closed and the weather was taking a turn for the worse. We took the Narrows trail along the Virgin River to the point where there is no escaping that you have to start navigating the waters and then we turned around. It's sprinkling now, but no matter, what a fantastic sight. We get back to the trailhead to find a sign up blocking the path that warns of imminent flash flooding. I'm tired of typing and you are tired of reading. We will go back! The enormous rock walls and colors are indescribable. I took video and my wife took many photos and neither can capture the beauty of what we saw with our eyes.

Zion's Main Canyon,Spent two days at the park. Could have easily spent another. A good start is to drive the road past the tunnel the double back to the visitor's center. They can tell you the best hikes to match your physical level. Shuttles load here for stops throughout the park. The full circuit takes about 40 minutes. Hikes range from the very easy river walk to the death march to bright angel. All will be an experience you won't forget soon.

Zion's Main Canyon,Loved this experience. Visited for 2 days and did one hike each day. River walk hike was easy and lovely. We did it late afternoon as the day cooled off and got to see many deer. Did more difficult hike next day up to 3rd level pool and found it challenging but well worth the effort. Use trekking poles and the climb is much easier. Food at concession was horrible. Chicken salad had so much mayo that it was not edible. Hike and scenery rate as 5+ but bring your own sustenance and water bottles.

Zion's Main Canyon,Zion Canyon is completely different from the other canyons in the region (Grand and Bryce) and that makes is quite spectacular. You get a total different view because you're looking upwards all the time instead of peaking down in the canyon. Especially try a bit of the narrows and Angels Landing.,"October 2, 2015",Stunning,61,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",4
Zion's Main Canyon,"To visit Zion's main canyon, you need to take the shuttle that departs every five or ten minutes from the visitor centre. There are regular stops along the road where you can get in/out and from where you can start the park's hikes. We spent two full days in the park and could probably have spent a third day. Our first hike was Angels Landing. The trail was paved for 3/4 of the hike, after which you get to the narrow ridge you need to climb to the top. This first part has some steep sections, but isn't particularly challenging. If you're afraid of hights, stop at the clearing after the switchbacks. The section over the ridge is more challenging. If you want to get killed or seriously injured, wear flipflops and bring a selfie stick. If you have enough common sense to wear proper boots/shoes that provide traction and you watch your step instead of the camera, it's a wonderful 30 min climb that will reward you with a great view. Plus you have a good chance of seeing turkey vultures overhead.In the afternoon, we walked up to the Emerald Pools. They are probably more beautiful in spring, late August/early september they're a bit dry. Second day we hiked the narrows. As it had been raining from time to time the days before, we regularly got our knees wet when crossing. But bring a walking stick or pole and wear good shoes and it's a great walk. Just keep an eye out for the weather. Just because they say the chance of a flash flood is low (the sign near the water will say 'possible), it doesn't mean that nothing can happen. When we were a few miles in, we had a thunderstorm with rain, so we immediately turned around and started walking back. Most people with us did, but we still saw people enter the canyon. All in all, it's a beautiful park. Take lots of water when you visit in hot weather (they say a gallon per person for a reason) as you will dehydrate quickly. And start your hikes early in the morning. It's quieter on the trails, you'll see more wildlife and you don't have to climb steep sections in the burning sun.","October 2, 2015",One of Utah's highlights,89,"Amstelveen, The Netherlands",4
Zion's Main Canyon,"You get to Zion National Park through the town of Springdale. There are plenty of places to stay and restaurants in Springdale so no need to figure out where you will eat either before or after your park visit. Parking is very limited in Zion, so park in Springdale and take the free shuttles into the park. if you are a senior citizen, remember to purchase your lifetime pass (covers you and your family) for $10. This is a substantial savings from the $15 per person entrance fee. Once in the park you will change from the Springdale shuttle system to the Zion Canyon Shuttle system that stops at each of the 9 locations in the Park. The shuttle is free and you may get on and off as often as you wish. You cannot drive your own car in Zion National Park. All of the hiking trails are clearly marked and the Zion newspaper does an excellent job of rating the trails from easy, moderate to strenuous. We were there the last week of September and the weather was perfect. Also the crowds were very thin making it easy to enjoy the park at our leisure. Dress in layers as the temperature can range a great deal as you change elevations and as you move from sun to shade. Also remember your water.","October 1, 2015",Visit Zion and Rock On!,172,"South Yarmouth, Massachusetts, USA",5

I recommend going in the off or late season and starting very early in the day. We arrived at 8am on a weekday and left at 1pm. We stopped at all the of the transit bus stops, and took several of the flat, short hikes.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion is an amazing place. I enjoyed it much more than the Grand Canyon because you are down in the canyon looking upwards 3,000 feet at the massive rock face. We took the Emerald Pools trail, which is beautiful and some other short hikes. My husband tackled the Angels Landing trail - whew! Plan a year in advance since lodging is very limited in the park. Lodging outside the park does not get good reviews. I rated it down one notch because Kolob Canyon (which is part of Zion National Park, but is separate from it) is smaller but cooler. In Kolob, you get really close to the rock faces even in your car.

Zion's Main Canyon,"As usual, my wife spent months researching the park, laying out itineraries, doing what-if scenarios and wondering if this would work or would it be better to do that.Here is my personal take. Buy a book on Zion if you want and do some research but what I discovered moments after we entered into the park was that anything you need to know was found in the handout at the entrance kiosk. The park is so easy to use. Park your car or use the shuttle from Springdale (you must arrive before 10:00 to park inside due to limited parking). Get on the park shuttle and get off anyplace you want and hop back on the next shuttle. The shuttles run more often than the posted 15 minutes. We never waited more than 5 minutes. The itineraries my wife had struggled over were out the window in minutes and we loved the relaxed feeling of just doing whatever when we felt like it. We hiked nearly to the top of Angels Landing - a wonderful but hard hike. We did not go all the way to the top (nearly) and would recommend this hike strongly. Another gem that was not very busy was Hidden Canyon - a great hike to a canyon area. Some places were dicey and the park service had placed chains to hold on to for safety. Worth the time and effort. We questioned whether we shoudl attempt The Narrows (we are a senior couple). We did and are so glad that we did. It was fun. We hiked up for approximately a mile. Difficult at times but doable. Suggest a hiking stick for sure for balance. Instead of renting shoes at the local outfitters for $23.00 a person, I brought along an old pair of tennis that were perfect and my wife spent $9.99 at Walmart for an inexpensive pair that held up nicely and she can use for knock around. Water and toilets are available in the park and many locations. No need to be a camel and carry lots of water with you.The bottom line for Zion National Park in my opinion is to enjoy it and not overplan it. It is very intuitive and I think all the tourist books that we had gathered actually over complicated it.","September 29, 2015",Uncomplicate Your Visit to Zion National Park,124,"Saint Paul, Minnesota",5

Some popular, unique and beautiful hikes include Angel's landing, Emerald Pools, and the Narrows.$30 gets you a pass for 7 days into the park, and just $20 more for an annual - every cent well worth it. Admission also includes unlimited rides on the shuttle, which takes to various areas of the park with access to trails and not accessible to cars. There is also lodging and camping available in the park grounds, but the park is awfully busy so plan accordingly. With that said, also make sure to get to the park early, around 7-10am preferably, so that you can find parking and don't have to wait in line to get on the shuttle.While you're in the area, make sure to also visit Bryce Canyon, only an hour and a half away.","September 15, 2015",Zion National Park is one of the most beautiful places on earth,96,"Whittier, California",5

The only thing that took away from it was the one million people visiting it at the same time as us!Zion does a really good job at keeping the impact of so many people to a minimum. It is very easy to get around all of Zion so it is easy for people to flood it. I wish there would be a permit system limiting the amount of people allowed in at one time.

Some have paved walks which are accessible for those in wheelchairs and strollers. Others are quite challenging, with others in-between.My favorite hike was to the Narrows.The trail begins with a paved path which is an easy walk along the Virgin River, then you get to the Narrows. The trail continues on for 9 miles, but one can go a shorter distance and enjoy this unique experience for as long as they wish and then return. This part of the hike continues in large part walking in the river bed. Even in August, the water is cold. The rocks you walk on are uneven and unstable. I recommend waterproof hiking sandals with a closed toe and bring a walking stick or trekking poles for stability. The beauty makes it well worth trying if one is physically able.

You used to be able to take your car anywhere in the canyon and now you have to use a shuttle. There are just too many people now, but if you come during the off-season (October is my favorite) you'll find it much more peaceful and much more like the place God intended it to be. The Emerald Falls hike is nice, but don't expect to go swimming any more. They stopped allowing that years ago. The Angel's Landing hike is awesome but not for the acrophobic. If you can manage the Subway or the Narrows, you're in for a delight. I also recommend Kolob Canyon - it's part of the park but seldom visited since it's not connected to the main park.

But at that time we did not have the time but I recall that the canyon drive was a traffic jamb mess that we had to drive by. Now with the shuttle the canyon visit is easy, clean, and much better for the environment in the canyon. Zion's Main Canyon is simply a continuing series of awesome towering sandstone mountains. The shuttle has several key stops from the Visitor Center to the very end at The Temple of Sinawava. Multiple opportunities for hikes from the easy to the strenuous. Hikes can be short or hours long and cover small elevations to climbing up the side of the cliffs.

Once inside the park I boarded the free shuttle, which stops at 8 points inside the park where you can hike or enjoy the view. I did hike three trails including the Emerald Pool, which was enjoyable. Also, located at some stops is a water refill station where you can fill up on Spring Water, which I did. Located inside the park is Zion Lodge, which looks nice although I didn't stay there.

Since we only had one day, so we either do Narrows or climb Angel's Landing. We finally decided to do Narrows, and it was fantastic! We were there in late Sep, the weather could not be better. We hiked the trail with water with our shoes and we thought that was the best decision after saw people struggled with bare foot in the water.

Zion's Main Canyon,"The park is beautiful. It definitely gets 5 stars for as far as scenery goes. The hiking trails are great. The wildlife encounters are great. The only negative, and this really takes away from the experience, is the hordes of people: too many people. At this time the park was full of people. A lot were visiting from other countries, mainly Europeans. Zion was running 22 double buses which you can cram about 80 people in and it was hard to get on a shuttle at times. Try leaving the park in the late afternoon. It was crazy. The popular hikes like Angels Landing and the Narrows were very crowded by late morning. If you hike early, like 7 to 8 am, you will have a much better experience (at least for the first part of your hike). While hiking Angels Landing we saw a lot of folks start out the hike but they never make it to the top. The switchbacks squash a lot of people’s enthusiasm. My son and I are in decent shape (we run, bike and lift), or at least we thought we were. These hikes will take its toll on your legs and joints. We did not stop and pushed ourselves on the hikes. We actually did Angels Landing in the morning (2 hrs up and down) and Observation Point in the afternoon (3 hrs up and down). It was too much. Our legs were sore for 5 days. If you are not use to elevation hiking your legs will be sore. My advice is to take it easy; go for a stroll and enjoy; don’t do too much. Angels Landing was ok going up but got crowned by mid-morning. Some of the longer hikes like Observation Point were less crowded. We passed about 10 people on that hike. The first part of the Narrows is super crowded and the further you go the less people you see. The Narrows is an easier hike; level through the swallow river. There are several shorter hikes that are family friendly. I don’t have a solution for the crowds but I suspect that the Park Services will eventually have to come up with a solution.","August 17, 2015",amazing,54,"Fort Worth, Texas",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion NP is a great place for the whole family. There are trails/paths to suit everyone with different fitness levels. The free shuttle bus will take you into the park if you are staying in Springdale. Once in the park you get another free bus which has various stops within the park itself, maps are provided when you enter the park which are very useful as the park is massive! There is a visitors centre which has all sorts of good information. Its worth knowing that there are plenty of water stations throughout the park where you can fill up your bottles free of charge!We hiked up to Angels Landing which was totally awesome. If you are doing this hike be prepared, go early, have breakfast before you leave, take plenty of water & snacks and take your time up the trail, there's no rush. Enjoy the scenery as you go and when you reach the top you will be blown away by the parks beauty from that height, it really is worth the effort. You can watch the eagles flying below you in the canyon, awesome!The Emerald pools are worth a visit, the hike is gentle enough for the whole family. We visited in July 2015 so being summer, the water cascading down the falls were not that impressive but I'm sure if you go in the wetter months the sight would be quite something. You can walk behind the waterfall which was nice as you get the spray off the falling water and as it was so hot it was very refreshing I have to say!We spent two days in Zion NP but as there are so many trails to discover you could spend at least another two if you had the time to spare!","August 15, 2015",A park to suit everyone,52,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Get up early and go early, the crowds are crazy in summer, and we paid the price by waiting for trams once the crowds showed up. We left St. George at 5:30 and got to the park by 7, by 9 the crowds were so bad people were parking on the road, and in town and using the free tram, that seems like it works nicely if you happen to get there later. The park is gorgeous, it is worthy of the national park designation.","August 14, 2015","Beautiful, worth the time and effort",40,"Sarasota, Florida",4
Zion's Main Canyon,"Made a 1 day stop with my family recently, as part of a road trip, really just hoping to get an idea of what was available to plan a longer trip later. The place is beautiful and easily accessible. From April to October, the main scenic drive area is only accessible by free shuttle buses that run from the visitor center at the park entrance to 10 or so spots of interest along the way. They run about every 10 minutes, so you never wait very long. There is also a different free shuttle from most hotels and several other stops in Springdale, just outside the park, to the visitor center. So, you can easily leave your car at the hotel or parked just about anywhere in town.Bring your camera and your hiking boots (or waterproof shoes you can hike in.) The park is a hiker's paradise, with numerous trails and panoramic vistas. We didn't find a whole lot of other things to do, but there are several spots to do these things. You can eat lunch at the Zion Lodge in the middle of the canyon, but not anywhere else that we could find (except by picnic - which is a good idea if you're up for it.)The guide you get when you enter (for the $30 entrance fee for a family) is very helpful in planning your day, and if you are in it mostly for a few nature hikes and a lot of pictures, you'll be able to do most everything you'd like in a day. Serious hikers and climbers can stay as long as they like and find plenty to do.","August 14, 2015","Beautiful park, manageable in a day or two",60,"Amarillo, Texas",5

The people in the visitors center are very helpful to provide itinerary ideas.Food was average and expensive (no big surprise) but there are a lot of wonderful restaurants in Springdale.Always carry water and snacks, be aware of the weather (the elevation is challenging for us Easterners!). Take breaks and be patient. Everyone wants that great photo and the opportunity to experience the grand scale.If you will be visiting other parks consider purchasing the America the Beautiful pass on your first day ($80) which is valid for a year for a carload entry or 4 people on foot entry.","August 13, 2015",Absolute Favorite!,61,"Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania",5

On our hiking trips though we did come across some slippery areas due to rain, so it's smart to be safe when hiking. The views are breath taking and not to be missed. And we got the opportunity to see quite a few deer and big horn sheep. Just make sure, as always when hiking, take a lot of water. There are numerous refill stations for you to refill your bottles. And if it's your first visit there, I suggest you take the free 40 minute shuttle ride around the park first to get acquainted with the area, it really helps.","August 12, 2015",Gorgeous,25,"Prescott Valley, Arizona",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"My husband and I visited Zion for the day. In planning, I was unsure about the shuttle bus but that turned out to be a fabulous way to see the Main Canyon. We arrived early morning a little before 8am. A previous review suggested to ride to the end and then work your way back at each stop and that worked out great for us. The bus out was loaded with hikers heading out to the narrows. We enjoyed hearing their excited plans and comments during the ride. Since health issues don't allow us long hikes, this plan was perfect. We walked around each stop and took tons of pictures then boarded the bus to the next stop. The short bus rides allowed us to rest a little to get ready for the next stop. The scenery in Zion's Main Canyon is so amazing and diverse that it is hard to put into words, start with spectacular and go up from there!","August 10, 2015",One of the best national parks,109,Southern USA,5

If you don't hike then the hop on hop off scenic drive on the shuttle bus is well worth the time and effort to enjoy the spendour of Zion. If you do hike then you have a good choice of easy, moderate and harder hikes. If you can, make sure you do at least one hike! We did the Emerald Pools, Riverside Walk and the Weeping Rock - all very enjoyable and relatively easy in the summer heat! Hopefully we will be lucky and return one day to try some longer hikes.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We visited here with our teenage daughter, having spent a week in the Grand Canyon and other deserts - the green of the trees against the red of the rock was a pleasant surprise.This park contains awesome scenery, which is also readily accessible (when compared to some parts of, say, Canyonlands). The difference here is that you are mostly below looking up. I climbed Angels Landing early one morning, before the crowds and the mid-day heat. A very steep 1500 foot walk ending with an airy scramble (what would be called a Via Ferrata in the Italian Dolomites) to finish. Halfway up you suddenly see the view, which had been hidden as you ascend a gorge - and it leaves you speechless. An energetic hike, but well worth the 2 hours each way. The park is well served with free shuttle buses (there is also a free shuttle bus service the length of Springdale) and all the rest rooms and restaurants you could ask for. Highly recommended as a short(ish) drive from Las Vegas; use the early mornings and evenings for the best light and to avoid the crowds.","August 2, 2015","Stunning colours, awesome rock, accessible way-out-there hikes",41,"Cambridge, UK",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"Absolutely breathtaking National Park. The trails provide views of spectacular rockoutcroppings. However, while visiting in July, the park is too crowded to enjoy the vistas( this review submitted by someone who enjoys solitude in nature). We also entered the park through Kolob Canyon, and hiked Taylor Creek trail, which was much more to my liking. On the plus side, it's gratifying to see the use of shuttles to transport visitors into the park. This solves the issue of vehicles crowding out the canyon, along with the air pollution they create. The shuttle system operates efficiently and we enjoyed the opportunity to travel from one part of the canyon, get out, hike a trail, and back into the shuttle. We visited Zion Canyon in February several years ago, and it was awesome. Very few people, but a large herd of elk gathered by the river. Very nice. Our next visitwill be in April or May.","July 29, 2015","Visit the park via Kolob Canyon entrance instead, during peak tourist season.",42,"San Jose, Costa Rica",3

Zion's Main Canyon,"I absolutely LOVE visiting Zion National Park and never had a horrible experience until this park. We drive there and are told to park in Springdale if visitor center is full (which it was). We drove through entire park to get to the other end to the visitor center (no parking) and continue OUT of the park to Springdale to find parking and take a shuttle in. We looked 30 to 45 minutes for a parking space in this town. It was a ZOO.....and 103 degrees. We finally get a parking spot, run to jump on a shuttle to take us back into the park. Based on their handout, they HIGHLY recommended the park shuttle to take us to places cars are not allowed to go. I was like this will be so worth the hassle. NOT! We are shuttled up and down for 80 minutes in a NON AIR CONDITIONED bus (remember its 103 outside), windows that just crack open, and a roofed bus with no visibility. You couldn't hardly see a thing. It was absolutely the worst ""sightseeing"" shuttle experience you could possibly imagine. We get back to visitor center to take the Springdale shuttle to get back to our vehicle. They cram 53 stinky sweaty people onto the shuttle to standing room only. I wanted to go back through the park to try and absorb some of the things we passed by initially to get to the glorious shuttle but with cars about 30 deep to enter, we said no freaking way and go the heck out of dodge. This park is not visitor friendly. If you are an avid hiker this would be the place for you, but otherwise, it is one huge crowded mess and add the heat to it and you are never so happy to leave that place and never return again.","July 26, 2015",You are herded through the park like cattle,15,"Phoenix, Arizona",1
Zion's Main Canyon,"This is the main attraction of Zion National Park and the main activity is to simply view the majestic rock formations rising up from the canyon floor. It is a narrow canyon; after the turn-off from Hwy 9, the canyon is little more than the width of the river and the road combined. In fact, when there is a significant rockfall, the river is impeded and flows over the road. There are many hiking trails in the canyon, and the easiest way to access them is the free shuttle system that operates during the peak season. The main canyon has cooler temps than the Watchman and South campgrounds, due, I suspect, to the slightly higher elevations, the cool Virgin River, and the water seeping from the rocks along the canyon walls.","July 25, 2015",A Spectacular Canyon,305,"Clayton, California",5

My only advise : take the first shuttle bus at the visitor center at 6PM and start walking at 6h30 or come in winter. The advantage of hiking so early is that you avoid the heat of the day (at least until 10PM) and you are +-alone in the Narrows (at least on your way up) or at Angels landing (without wrestling a way to the top between hunderds of tourists).Or avoid the popular trails or take the longer trails (east rim trail, west rim trail, La Verkin trail, Hop Valley trail)","July 5, 2015",Hiking paradise but cowded,378,"Lier, Belgium",4

Zion's Main Canyon,"This was the 8th US National Park we visited and it was the least visitor-friendly. We were booked into the Lodge but discovered on arrival that we needed a permit to drive up there. No info as to how/where to obtain such a thing. We decided to try the visitor's centre but the carpark was full and signs instructed us to leave the park (!), park in the nearby town and return by shuttle.Needless to say we drove round and round in circles whilst one of us went to the centre. There was a desk for the Lodge but the perky little sign said, 'Sorry we missed you! Gone to lunch.' It was 11am.Eventually a ranger came out and issued the permit, with the proviso that we only drove as far as the Lodge. Many of the shuttles were standing room only: there was no air con and it was over 100°.We later drove thru the nearby town (where you were supposed to park). It was rammed full of cars, abandoned in any possible spot.The scenery was spectacular but my advice is to go to Bryce Canyon!

From weeping rocks to private canyon views, the canyon offers something for everyone.Hint: If you want to enjoy fewer people on your shuttle ride go to the last viewpoint and work your way back to the Visitor's Center.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We started out late in the day but we were able to see quite a bit at the park. There are some hikes that shouldn't be done with young children but I believe the visitor's center could advise on which hikes would be accessible for youngsters.My friend and I wanted to see the Grotto, Emerald Pools, Weeping Rock and Kayenta Falls. We spent the better part of an hour looking for the ""Grotto"". There were signs but when we followed them, we ended up on a service road. We asked other hikers and they gave us a variety of answers quite diverse...""This whole place is called the Grotto."", ""The Grotto is just around this bend and it's awesome!"", ""You're almost there, it's just up this path."" We finally walked across the road, giving up on the Grotto and someone we met told us the Grotto was along the Emerald Pool trail. Honestly, we gave up on that and headed towards the Emerald Pools because it was a loop that took in everything else we wanted to see that afternoon. The hike was really nice but honestly, but the thing that took my breath away was the sheer size of the mountains. They were so majestic. The idea that they were carved away is an astounding thought. It was also the perfect time of the year to catch the prickly pear cactus in bloom. Such lovely colors. I don't know if they bloom all summer but I was glad we got to see them.","June 11, 2015",For Everyone!,117,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Please if you have the time check this place out. Such a beautiful place. The wildlife, the views, & the variety of difficulty in hiking options all make this a wonderful state park. Tips: Check the weather! There are a variety of places to hike and weather should determine what you do. If you want to hike the narrows the best time is in early June or in September. (that is right before and right after monsoon season) Even if it's clear there but it's raining north of the canyon it could still flood. You don't need wet suites (at least we didn't and we went very far) but you do need water shoes. We saw people rent some water boots from nearby places that seemed to work out well. Bring a change of shoes for the ride back to your car, even if it's just socks (you'll be in the water a long time)If you don't want to be surrounded by tons of tourists go EARLY! It might be worth it to just get a season pass to all state parks. Chances are likely that you'll be there for a few days and it's just a better value. Go on the scenic drive! You'll pass through a large tunnel and you'll see things that aren't in the main canyon. (we even saw some bighorn sheep!) Be wary though because there are few bathrooms on that route and people will drive extremely slow. So before you go on that, use the restroom in the main canyon facilities. If you need to get supplies and don't want to pay the prices of Springdale there is only one Walmart about an hour away.

We understood that we could not ride the roads within the park but only in a shuttle bus which we all found quite relaxing and one could get off at the various stops and then get the next or later bus to continue. Once again as in many of the parks there are numerous hiking trails for those inclined and of course various safety warnings and advice. You can get refreshments at the various stops.

When we visited in May, there were only 3 (over the entire day) meetings to provide additional information to visitors. And one of the meetings were repeated during the day, so you had to hang out at the museum all day to attend the lectures if you wanted to attend them all. From the main canyon floor, you can look up at the towering mountains and be in awe of the forces it took to make them. The shuttle will provide a better view than the canyon floor.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion National Park is a ""Bucket List"" item. The fact that you're on this site says that you already know that for sheer majestic beauty, Zion is really hard to beat. Just riding the National Park Service bus (sorry, no private vehicles) from one end to the other will give you lots of vistas, but the real beauty is best seen when you get off the bus and hike one or more of the many trails. Here are some tips that will help you plan your trip;1) If you're staying in Springdale (recommended!), leave your car at your motel and hop on the free Zion shuttle bus that runs through town every few minutes. Your wait won't be more than 15 minutes. (Be aware that there's major construction at the park entrance itself and that parking is very limited as a result. Way better to leave your car in town and use the shuttle.) The shuttle will take you to the Visitor Center at the park entrance where you'll pay for your ticket and then be directed to one of the National Park Service (NPS) buses that takes you to the first stop in the park, the Human History Museum, where you can see an introductory film about the park. (Film is worth seeing!)2) After the film, you'll hop on another NPS bus that takes you (""upbound"") through the park itself. You'll have the opportunity to get off the bus at any of several stops along the way, each stop accessing various hiking trails. Some of the stops do have restroom facilities. Only one or two have water available -- wouldn't hurt to bring some water along.3) You will have received a guide that shows all the hiking trails, rates their difficulty from easy to strenuous, and tells you how long the hike would be, both in distance and time. Judge for yourself which are most appropriate, based on your interest and physical condition. In the ""easy"" category, we found the ""Weeping Rock"" trail very worthwhile and the Riverwalk trail at the end of the line (""Temple of Sinawava"") fun to do. The Riverwalk follows the Virgin River for about a mile to ""The Narrows"". If you choose to go into The Narrows, be advised that you'll be walking in the river itself. To do this, you'll want proper boots and clothing -- see the recommendations by other reviewers as found in ""The Narrows"" part of Zion reviews. Some really good advice there! Boots, etc., can be rented from shops in Springdale. 4) Unless you get involved in serious hiking and exploration, you'll find that 4 - 6 hours will be plenty of time for a Zion visit. If you have two full days, consider a day-trip to Bryce Canyon -- about 2 hours there, 2.5 hours in the park, and 2 hours back to Springdale. Well worth it!!!! (See my separate review of Bryce Canyon National Park.)5) We were at Zion in late March, 2014, and the crowds weren't bad. Other reviewers have noted that Zion gets crowded in summer months -- no surprise. Hotel reservations WELL in advance are a must for late spring/summer/early fall.. See my separate review for Majestic View Lodge for that recommendation and more info about Springdale.6) Suggestion for an alternate plan (This is what we did.). Day 1 -- drove from Salt Lake City (4.5 hours), toured Zion in the afternoon. Day 2 -- breakfast in Springdale, drive to Bryce, tour, then drive the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument route back to Salt Lake City. See this website for Escalante: www.utah.com/nationalsites/grand_staircase.htm. Beautiful drive!!! We arrived back in SLC around 7:30 p.m. Makes for a long day, but SO worth it!You will LOVE the majestic beauty of Zion (Bryce and Escalante,too)!

Zion's Main Canyon,"I agree with other reviewers that this national park ranks among the top in dramatic and unique scenery: the swirling red and white rock formations, towering canyon walls, the wildlife, and the rushing Virgin River giving it all life--making this desert locale inhabitable. It is unfortunate that the park is extremely crowded, detracting immensely from the experience. Granted, we visited during Spring Break once the shuttle system had started and ""overflow parking"" was forced into the neighboring town of Springdale (note that the park's primary parking lots are under construction, which only serves to make a bad situation worse); so perhaps it is a much better experience in January or February. But it was so crowded when we visited, the dangers of Angels Landing Trail were exacerbated by the hordes of people clambering to get their pictures taken on top. I couldn't escape to other trails because each of those was crowded as well. I skipped the crowded hiking trails for an afternoon sitting by and photographing the Virgin River--a much more peaceful and pleasurable experience. On one hand, I am glad so many people are out appreciating our national parks; but on the other, those types of crowds in relatively small spaces defeat the purpose of ""communing with nature."" It felt more like Six Flags (amusement park) than a spiritual experience. My partner commented on how many people we passed with frowns on their faces in this breathtaking space. Crowds could have been a factor.I recommend visiting this unique park during the winter or perhaps fall. I wouldn't go again in the spring--and certainly not summer. I can't comment on the Zolob Canyon experience, which might be less crowded.Final note: Sadly, I agree with the previous reviewer who said the winding east entrance drive was their favorite (contrasted with the crowded park). In addition to the magnificent rock formations, we saw deer, turkey, desert bighorn sheep, and a golden eagle.","March 20, 2015","Spectacular Scenery, Amusement Park Experience",26,"Houston, Texas",4
Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion is a scenic park, but it has it's problems. We arrived mid-week, in the off -season, and it was crammed to capacity....people everywhere(hate to see it in the summer tourist season!). Parking is at a premium at most locations......remember, you are in a narrow dead-end canyon.

Zion's Main Canyon,"I read several places where this was a nice day trip out of Las Vegas, just 2 1/2 hours. Not true. First off it took us 4 hours to get there and 5 hours back. What I never read was that when you drive thru the park, you come out miles east of where you entered. (no where upon entering do you know this) When you come out, you suddenly find yourself at a completely isolated unknown area, can either go on east or turn around and drive back thru again the laborious switchback mountains of the canyon. There are no houses, cars, stores, nothing but deserted land.We drove east (opposite direction, we wanted to go west) for 26 miles until we came upon a town, Mt Carmel. The man at the gas station said people are constantly stopping asking for directions as they find themselves as lost as we did. It took us 5 hours to go back to Vegas this way, driving in the dark which was not fun.The area is beautiful, if you are in the area, great to see.","February 14, 2015",A long trip from Las Vegas,124,"Florence, Kentucky",4

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion National Park is a must see for lovers of National Parks and the outdoors in general. The canyon is only a fraction of the park, but it is the most popular & heavily traveled area. Too me it reminded me of a mini red-rocked Yosemite, crowds included. We visited during the off season (mid-week November) and I still found it pretty crowded. Much like many parks if you take the effort to travel a short distance from the paved roads the crowds quickly diminish and although there isn't any solitude you can enjoy yourself.The views are unbelievable & there are a variety of great hikes. The wildlife was abundant too as we saw deer, wild turkeys, a fox, evidence of beaver, and on the park's east side several herds of bighorn sheep. Make sure to explore all Zion has to offer, but also brave the crowds and visit the valley. It's one of my new favorite spots.","December 17, 2014","Crowded, But A Must See National Park",279,"San Diego, California",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"The road through the main canyon is closed during the busy summer, but the free shuttles in Zion are an excellent way to get into the canyon. It stops at a many points of interest, including the Temple of Sinawava, which accesses the Narrows, Weeping Rock, The Grotto, and Zion Human History Museum. The geology of this canyon is impressive, and beautiful. The canyon was sculpted by water over the past two million years. The name Zion was given to the canyon by the Mormons, who considered it a sanctuary where a traveler could experience awe, immensity and enternity.","December 14, 2014","Awe, Immensity and Enternity",27,"Vancouver, Canada",4
Zion's Main Canyon,"Comparing to other National Parks, Zion is relatively small. It's basically a 15 mile long portion of a large Canyon, with a river at the bottom. It has the Rusty on Green color palette Arizona is known for. Because it's a deep canyon with running water, it has some extreme diversity - anything from swamps along the river to mountain desert on the top. Because it's so small, and provides excellent access by shuttles, roads and trails, you can pack all these extreme experiences into short (a few hours long usually) trips.So some advices.Because it's a canyon, it has two main kinds of paths - some go at the bottom, they give you great views of the mountains and don't require much hiking up and down and relatively easy. A good example is a trail to the Emerald Pools. The other kind is hiking up so you can enjoy the view of the valley. The two most famous ones are to the Observation point and to Angels Landing. They are both a half a day trails, they are about as hard to walk as roughly run 5k. Keep in mind, that you'd need to walk along a 3 feet wide path at the edge of the vertical cliff for long time, so if heights make you feel uncomfortable - it might be not your cup of tea. The Narrows is a special trail of it's own kind. Basically you just walk along the river in the water. Another advice Because it's a canyon which goes North to South, the best times to take pictures or the mountains would be soon after sun rise or closer to sunset. At those times low sun highlights the vertical walls for the canyon and it brings up the shades of red of the rocks. But if you want to photograph the valley, you'll probably like high mid day sun.","December 13, 2014","Perfect for hiking - small, but well maintained, not crowded in winter",881,"Pleasanton, California",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"You park the car, enter the park and jump on board one of the buses lined up to take you up and down the Canyon. You get the itinerary of what you can see at each stop and the map provided to you gives you a rough idea of the time you may spend at any one of the stops via a long hike or a short family walk. We had our 15 month old little boy so the big adventures were out but I must say many of the short walks had great paths and I was able to push him along most of the short trails so we ended up seeing quite a lot.I'm not a big hiker so I'm probably not the one to rave about Zion but I loved it for what it had to offer me and my family.","December 2, 2014",Great for hiking or simply for a nice walk.

It is like we are in a valley which cut across the mountains. We didn't know what to expect when we arrved, but it didn't take long to notice the vibrant colors of the fall folliage and the rocks.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Yes, this place is crowded. The parking is tight and the crowds are huge. That said, the landscape of Zion Canyon is ""fairytale like"". Like something out of a storybook. It is for the most part a hiker's park and that is not everyone's cup of tea. Many reviewers complain of the shuttles but they make it so you see the fabulous landscape instead of 40,000 cars. Two very nice breaks from the shuttle are to walk the PaRus Trail from Canyon Junction to the visitor center and the Grotto Trail from the Zion Lodge to the Grotto. Both feature great scenery and the PaRus is paved. The restrooms at the visitor center are nice and quite clean. The center is also very nice. The trails in the canyon are well marked and extremely well maintained. Grab a copy of the free park newspaper to check out levels of difficulty. My recommendation is if you want a parking place get out of bed and get there early. This is the busiest NP in the state of Utah. If you do have to park in Springdale the park has a very accessible pedestrian entrance but you have to kind of look for it. With the exception of Angel's Landing you will find that the tougher the trail the smaller the crowd. By all means, steer clear of this place on weekends!!!

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion is a small cousin of the Grand Canyon and Bryce Canyon National Parks. With Zion, you are in the bottom of the canyon looking up and consequently, you don't have to deal with cliffs at every turn and the temperatures tend to be warming. It also takes longer for the areas in shadow to get some light during the day. The mountains really soar up from the floor of the canyon and the Virgin River flows through the bottom. There are many hikes and many sites to see in the main canyon. I'd recommend the Emerald Pools as well as the Narrows. Just riding the shuttle through the park is a treat in and of itself. There are many day hikes you can choose from. You definitely should have some hiking shoes (not sneakers or running shoes and definitely NOT flip-flops). There are lots of rocks and gravel as well as dust on the trails. Also, you will need a canteen or water bottle to carry water with you and it wouldn't hurt to have a small back pack to carry extra clothes and some snacks. Once you get into the park, you don't want to waste your time by having to come back out for food or drink. There is a lodge inside the park were you can stay overnight and gets food/drinks from the restaurant, but it is better to be self-sufficient on the trail. I would allow at least two days and three if you can to see all there is to see at Zion. In my opinion, it is the one of the most scenic of the parks in that area of Utah and well work spending extra time to explore.","November 1, 2014",Great National Park with beautiful scenery,107,"Hockessin, Delaware",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"We read all reviews and planned our fall camping trip to Zion, accordingly. We were advised to arrive at the South Campground by 9am as all campsites were 75% vacated daily. We were told the sites by the river were the best so we circled those loops 3X but all were occupied. We broadened our sweep and all were still full. The last loop was next to the roadway (least desirable on first glance) and luckily saw someone breaking down camp. We asked them if they were leaving and they were. We paid for the site and the campground host posted a sign that read “occupied” on the clip to let everyone know the site was taken. We returned 2 hrs. later to set up camp after it had been vacated. What a hidden gem! This site (#3) was very private next to a meadow frequented by a herd of deer. We loved it! It’s especially private for RVs or trailers as the camp vehicle blocks your view of the adjacent camp sites. Be asserted—ASK people if they are leaving. The odds of finding a vacant site as you drive by are minimal. You need to ask people! Watchman Campground is nicer but requires reservations. Loved our stay! Lots of hikes!

Zion's Main Canyon,"We love national parks. Zion is incredible. There are not enough adjectives to describe the awesome wonder of this place. A few suggestions:Take every ranger talk, walk and ride that you can. The park rangers do a great job of learning about the park, so they can teach us. At the museum a ranger talked with us about the geology and how the canyon was formed. ""Ride with a ranger"" got us on a bus with about 30 others and a ranger who told us what we were looking at as we rode up the canyon. This bus stops where the regular buses do not, so you get to see a few more isolated areas, and great explanations of the formations and some of the human history. The ranger led walk at the Temple of Sinewava trail gives you much more information about the various micro climates you are seeing and some more of the human history in the gorge.October is a great time of year, not too hot and not too cold, but if you are hiking any distance, take plenty of water. Do take some of the hikes. Even the easy/moderate hikes give amazing views and are worth every step. Wear appropriate hiking boots. Sneakers can pass, but are not sufficient if you really want to enjoy the hike instead of thinking about the comfort of your feet. Forget sandals and flimsy shoes. Stay on the main canyon floor level walks if that's all you have.Wear a hat and sunscreen. You are exposed to a lot of sun here. Even on cloudy days UV rays get through!Have a beer at the Zion lodge cafe. What a great way to end a day of hiking (not so good an idea at the beginning of a hike).Just look around you.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We visited in October outside of the holiday season and summer heat. We also arrived on Wednesday when crowds were lower, on Friday and Saturday the crowds were noticeably higher, but not unbearable.The temperature in October is also perfect, not too hot or cold during the day and evening. Each morning the wind is up and it was cold so bring a light jacket that you can take off and easily carry as you hike.Parking in the park is limited so arrive in the park by 8am to get a spot. Otherwise park just outside the park entrance and walk in...or park in Silverdale and get the free shuttle. The shuttle buses within the party are great to take you through the park but lines form from mid morning onwards.You could do the main hikes in two days, but we stayed for four, doing a hike each morning then relaxing in the afternoon; the hikes vary in difficulty but all are tiring after a while.I found the hike up to Scout's Outlook the best but the extension up to Angel's Landing true to the category of strenuous. It is also dangerous but mostly because of the carelessness of others...it was each man for himself so to speak and it made me uneasy after a while so I turned back....only to see even more hikers making their way up so the journey back to Scouts Outlook felt more dangerous than going up.

The Narrows and Angels Landing are other popular strenuous hikes. Angels Landing is NOT for you if you have any fear of heights; the last bit is across a narrow beam of rock way with steep drop offs on either side. The Narrows follows the Virgin River and may flash flood if it rains.","October 15, 2014","Well done, Zion.",4,"New York, New York, United States",5
Zion's Main Canyon,We really enjoyed our day in the Zion Canyon. We did several easy or moderate hikes and really enjoyed the scenery and nature. The shuttle bus thru the canyon was super convenient. We would definitely recommend the Riverwalk Trail into the narrows for a nice stroll along the river. The Canyon Overlook Trail (just east of the long tunnel) leads to an incredible view - but it's difinitely not for anyone with a fear of heights or with little kids - there are some pretty narrow paths with big drops. ,"October 15, 2014",Beautiful & great for leisurely hikes...,22,"Milwaukee, WI",4
Zion's Main Canyon,"My wife and I visited Zion the day after we visited Bryce. They couldn't have been more different. After hours of looking down at Bryce , we now found ourselves looking up.The road into Zion is a winding , attractive one with a new sight at each curve. We got a very early start which proved to be good for us in many ways. As the light of day crept into the various canyons of Zion , a variety of shadows and colors were on display. As we left after 1 pm , we also noticed greatly increased traffic coming into the park area and many cars parked along the side of the road in a fairly random pattern. The main parking lots fill quickly and overflow parking is available in Springdale a mile away with a shuttle service to the Visitor Center. The Visitor Center is large and informative and later we returned to find some great choices in the gift shop for our grandchildren.Everyone must use the shuttle system to explore Zion. We took the shuttle to the Temple Of Sinawava stop did the Riverside Walk to the Narrows Area. I have an impending hip replacement so we turned back at this time but many people arranged for the necessary equipment to proceed into the Narrows area. As we used the shuttle to go to stops for other hikes, we enjoyed different aspects of the park. On the hike to the Emerald pools , we started to notice an increase in traffic on the trail and were glad that we had accomplished much of what we wanted to see. Everything is well maintained , shuttles stop frequently and there is a variety of things to see.We left feeling very satisfied but thankful we didn't have crowds to deal with. I can imagine that the park is very crowded in the summer season.","October 14, 2014",At The Bottom Looking Up,274,"Syracuse, New York",5
Zion's Main Canyon,The views were awesome everywhere you turned and hiking up the river in water shoes was an absolute unique adventure.We also did horseback riding in the afternoon amidst the beautiful and naturally cut mountains.

Zion's Main Canyon,"One of two of our favorite parks in Utah. The drive up is beautiful, go slow so you don't miss a thing. Lots of turn-outs to explore and depending on the time of day, you should see some wildlife. Once you enter the main park, it's a little difficult to find parking but we found some in Springdale and really enjoyed walking around this little artistic town. The shuttle is a wonderful way to orientate yourself to the park. We took it from Springdale to the main park, then road to the last hike, the Narrows, and hiked in until the water blocked our way. Lots of people had gear to hike through the water and next time we will be prepared. We missed the theater showing as it closed at 5pm on Sunday but we will return and plan to do a few more easy hikes..","October 14, 2014",A Must See National Park,749,"The Woodlands, Texas",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion would have to be my favourite place on Earth and especially the walk to Angels Landing. My wife and I climbed it a few years ago and couldn't wait to bring our kids back. We did this in September 2014 with my wife's parents. The eight of us aged 7 (yes 7 rears old) to 66 climbed to Angels Landing and all loved it. No pictures or words can describe the thrill you get with this hike. In Australia you would not be allowed to do it as it is so dangerous. The last part of the climb stretches out into the valley with vertical cliffs falling either side 1,000's of feet.Zion is a few hours north of Las Vegas and one full day will give you a great appreciation of the place, although three days is better. You do not need a car as the only way to get around is by a free shuttle bus. If going to Zion also go to Bryce National Park if you have time for half a day.","October 14, 2014",words cannot expalin,4,,5
Zion's Main Canyon,"We just returned from Zion and stayed in the Zion Lodge within the park. It was amazing. We rate it as lovely as Yosemite and perhaps better in that every vista is looking at different high canyon walls. There are easy, moderate, and difficult hikes accommodating every ability. October is a great month to visit but the park is open year round. Make reservations ahead as space is limited. The town at the entrance of the park also has motels. The shuttle is required at peak season but runs every 7 to 15 minutes so little waiting is needed.","October 14, 2014",Do Not Miss Zion National Park,56,"Dallas, Texas",5

Once in the Canyon I recommend the shuttles. The Town of Springdale has some pretty nice Hotels, Motels and food and beverage facilities. Lots of hiking available if you are up for it. Some of the shorter hikes are pretty nice. Wear proper footwear.","October 14, 2014",Wow.....,110,"Miami, Florida",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Should you include Zion National Park in your schedule ? Should you stay there more than one day ? Should you do some hiking inside ?. The answer is yes, yes and yes. We found this an extremely nice national park. The sights are amazing and the nice part is that even if you are not an experienced hiker, you can easily do some of the easier hikes because these routes are paved and can even be used by strollers. Although busy it never feels crowded and it is so much nicer to walk than drive by car. And needless to say that the views are stunning and change with every corner you turn. If you want to bring your own food the ""Grotto"" stop has more than sufficient pick nick tables and we never had to wait for one to clear. We will certainly be back for more.","October 14, 2014",Amazing,160,"Santa Ana, Costa Rica",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion's shuttle network and trails are laid out very well, easy to understand, and encompass a lot of what the park has to offer. If you have been to other parks in southern Utah, don't assume you've seen it all. Each park has it's own scenery and characteristics, all unique in their own way. In the case of Zion, I found it to be more heavily covered in flora than places like the grand canyon and bryce. There are plenty of different hikes for people of all fitness levels, from short walks alongside river beds, to angel's landing. If you enjoy being outdoors, this park has something for everyone.","October 14, 2014",Efficient organization,239,"New York City, New York",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"Four of us went to Zion on two separate days. The first day we hiked to the Emerald Pools and the Riverside Trail on our own. The park is an incredible place, with gorgeous views everywhere you look. The shuttle system is terrific. Riverside Trail was so much fun, wading in the river to the beginning of the Narrows. But the highlight of our experience with Zion has to be the Thursday Trek with Park Ranger Mychael. He was so knowledgeable, patient and personable. He guided us on two hikes, gave us in-depth history of the park (including the tunnel), geology and cultural information, and showed us petroglyphs. We had lunch on a giant rock, saw big-horned sheep, and got amazing pictures. In my opinion, Mychael made our trip to Zion perfect!!!!","October 7, 2014",Easy Hikes and Thursday Trek,21,New York,5
Zion's Main Canyon,"The was our final stop on our camping trip - Possibly the most beautiful spot I have every seen. I could not take my eyes of the walls of the canyon, but hiking and not watching where you are going is not a good idea. The deepest blue sky, red canyon walls. We arrived mid afternoon and by 4pm hit the Emerald Pools trail all the way to the upper pool. Perfect time of day as the sun was not beating down on us and there is a nice tree canopy. The next morning we started the Hidden Canyon Trail, about a 2 hr round trip strenuous hike, but stopped and turned around when we found part of the chain missing that you hang onto - turned out to be the best thing ever as we found the East Rim Trail on our return. That was so amazing and being there by 11am beat the crowds, kept us in the shade.","October 6, 2014",Zion National Park,22,"San Luis Obispo, California",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"The scenery in Zion is absolutely breathtaking with the rocky peaks and the blue skies hugely photogenic from dawn to dusk. We thought the main canyon was well organised in terms of the (free) shuttle buses being the only means of transport - great that there were effectively no cars about. With some 10 stops it's completely up to each visitor how to organise their day, there are lots of hiking trails from long and difficult to relatively short. You can even just take the 80 minute round trip on the bus. My wife and I got of at every stop and sampled some of the shorter walks and had a very happy day. Do try and take in the orientation film at the Museum at the first stop. We'd also recommend a stop for lunch at Zion Lodge. Simple sandwiches and salads but I think the only place in the park that sells food. And being Zion the usual stunning scenery as you take your luncheon. And did I mention the amazing scenery....","October 5, 2014",Lovely day for non-hikers,577,"Wellington, New Zealand",5

We had to park in the town of Springfield because the parking was full in Zion, although the parking lot is so small it doesn't take much to fill it up. The park offers a shuttle to all the major points in the southern part of the park, and you hop on and off. Great! We stopped at all the major points, and even walked down to the Narrows although we didn't cross it since we didn't have the proper equipment. The water isn't deep but you need waders or shoes (like Keen's) that can get wet and help you cross since the bottom is all rocks.","October 5, 2014",A true gem of nature,146,"Cleveland, Ohio",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion National Park is a breathtakingly beautiful natural wonder. The national park service maintains a wonderful and efficient shuttle service that takes the visitor to all the trailheads, museums, lodge etc, making the wonder and beauty of the park convenient and available. Food, lodging, hiking, horseback riding, museum, gift shop, parking, camping and restrooms are all available within the park. Unfortunately-make reservations months in advance as the park is a popular tourist destination and fills up daily. Then you are at the mercy of the merchants of Springdale, the scenic little town at the entrance to the park that maintains itself by shamelessly gouging the tourist for food and lodging. We not only had our money sucked, but literally our blood too, by the bedbugs at Terrace Brook Hotel. Apparently they continue to rent rooms out, continuing to spread the scourge. I recommend making reservations well in advance of travel, and staying in the park.

Did the Emerald Pool trail which is suited for all levels really and rather crowded. The Kayenta trail can be connected to the Emerald Pool trail but is much quieter.

Zion's Main Canyon,"This was our last stop through the national parks in Utah. $25 to get in, but we had a national annual pass so the fee is covered. This day ended up being a Saturday, which meant lots of people. Would recommend going during the middle of the week if possible. When we first drove in, there was a long line of cars. There is a long tunnel, which goes through the mountain. Sometimes they have to hold traffic on one side if a trailer has to go through, so it may take longer to get in. It was the only park where we actually sat in traffic, but they said it is the most visited park. It was also about 90 degrees at the time, the hottest of any of our park adventures. Once inside, parking lots were full; we got lucky to find a spot. They offer free shuttles so many months of the year to cut down on traffic (cars are actually prohibited to these areas during this time). The shuttles makes multiple stops and come by every few minutes, so it's easy to get on and off and not have to wait too long. We made our way to the end in order to hike through the river. Other things to do see are the Emerald pools, and Weeping Rock (very easy hikes).There are many strenous hikes and rock climbing for the avid sportsman. I would like to go back during an off time when it wasn't so crowded.","September 24, 2014",Part of a tour of many parks,34,"Louisville, Kentucky",4

Zion's Main Canyon,"I just took my parents, whom are from Michigan, on a tour of the Mighty 5 for their 50th anniversary. All I can say is that Zion was the most grand and beautiful of them all from a ""tourist"" point of view. Unlike the other National Parks, this place has the most topical features. Driving through the Mt. Carmel-Zion highway you gets small glimpses through ""windows"" cut through the rock. Once through the tunnel - BAM! We were in awe at the grandeur in front of us. Even on a Wednesday, there was an abundance of visitors in the Park.This is now where I become just a tad critical. This is in no way meant to detour people from visiting because this place really should be on everyone's bucket list! However, in the main sections of this park it is a bit over-commercialized for my liking. There's a shuttle service running up and down the canyon. Parking was a nightmare, even on a Wednesday. My husband and I prefer more remote and primitive locations but were not able to wander off the paved and crowded pathways with elderly patents in-tow. We do plan on returning to hike Angels Landing, and hopefully someday The Subway (which can only be visited by permit through a convoluted lottery-system).","September 21, 2014","Amazing, amazing, amazing!",47,Cottonwood Heights,5

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion is an incredibly beautiful national park! We only had one day here, and one could easily spend longer, but we were still satisfied with all we were able to see and do. Since our time was limited, probably the best hike we did was starting on the Kayenta Trail and then meeting up with the Upper and Lower Emerald Pools trails. This enabled us to see lovely scenery, away from the crowds on the unpaved parts. We came across animal tracks and lovely views of the river and surrounding mountains. Another favorite hike was the Canyon Overlook Trail. I am moderately afraid of heights and a little uncertain whether I would be comfortable. I was a little hesitant near the top, but very glad I persevered and finished. This hike was well worth it! The location is easy to miss. The parking lot is immediately on your right after the tunnel, when leaving the park traveling East. We also did the Riverside Walk to the Start of the Narrows, but will have to save the Narrows for another trip when we have more time and are prepared. We also did the Weeping Rock trail.

After, we chose the emerald pools trail. It was beautiful, and gave us great exercise without requiring advanced hiking skills. A Utah native we know strongly suggested the narrows and Angel's Landing. I really wanted to do the Narrows, but the brochure said it was an advanced hike and I have to work my way up to that because We aren't really experienced people. Not to mention, those hikes I believe are 6-8 hours round trip and I think we had about five hours in the park. Next time, we plan to stay over right there in the park, and do more hiking. The lodge there looked really nice, and we noticed the restaurant had a few vegetarian options, good to know.

While there take the Narrows hike through the river to Wall Street where the sides of the canyon shoot 1500 feet up on both sides. Rent your equipment for this hike as the rocks can hurt and the water is cold. Also take the Angels Landing trail where Williams Wiggles switchbacks will test your fitness. Stay away from the edge again if this is a problem for you if not you will find plenty of places for great pictures. Pack camera, water and sunglasses but otherwise go light. If you are not as daring you can stay on Boy Scout Landing while the braver bunch head across the saddle and beyond to the top.

They have short trails (about 1 mile ) to extensive trails (up to 15 miles) for more experienced hikers. You can even climb the walls if you have that kind of talent. The park service will help you get proper permits if needed to due the more extensive hikes. The shorter ones do not need much except some spirit and make sure you carry WATER.Also, the park has many bathrooms and drinking water at most stops.","August 24, 2014",What a Great Place to See Nature without Breaking a Sweat,136,"Tucson, Arizona",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"This is really a tale of not one, but Two National Parks.....and yes, I am talking about Zion!You see, while most folks visit and remember Zion's Main Canyon (the one with the mandatory shuttle buses in the Spring and Summer) for its absolutely breathtaking and dizzying steep walls, viewed from the bottom, unless you want to climb and hike up to the rim ....there is another LESSER KNOW NORTH-WESTERN SECTION to Zion National Park. That is, YOU CAN VISIT ANOTHER GREAT SECTION located to the northwest, just back over that impressive rim you are looking up at that's causing the ""crick"" in your neck! IT IS CALLED KOLOB CANYON DISTRICT OF ZION NP.This is the second or North-western section of Zion National Park, which is too often missed, as people speed by it on I-15, heading south to Las Vegas......well, STOP AND TURN BACK! This section is also officially a part of Zion National Park. It consists of the series of canyons adjacent to I-15, officially called the Kolob Canyon District of Zion National Park. We would have missed it, too, had not Park Ranger Nick, who was working now at Colorado National Monument, not told us about it. Kolob Canyon is much less crowded than the Main Canyon.Kolob Canyon District is reachable only off of I-15 by means of a dead-end loop road, and it offers its visitors more breath-taking beautiful red rock canyons PLUS the gorgeous 310 foot long arch (yes, the size of a football field and almost an end zone) called KOLOB ARCH! YOU JUST HAVE TO SEE IT TO BELIEVE IT....another whole district of Zion National Park. WOW!!!Kolob Canyon District has its own entrance station (your main canyon ticket is good here), combined with a Visitor Center, and neat book and souvenir store, restrooms, plus daily special Park Ranger led programs and Junior Ranger programs for the kids. It is a self-driving dead-end loop road....great views in both directions of travel, carved by the picturesque Taylor Creek, tumbling down the 2,000 foot thick layers of Navajo Sandstone formed from a beach sand accumulating there some 180 - 190 million years old (think of the Jurassic Park era). The saw-toothed and peaked mountains are the remains of that beach sand, now towering above Kolob Canyon's Taylor Creek watershed, and providing many very impressive mind-bending vistas for its visitors....and you will become the latest person to view this vista, joining your footprints with those of beach creatures of the Jurassic era!Access Kolob Canyon District of Zion National Park on the I-15 interstate roadway, and watch for signs to turn off just a bit LESS THAN HALFWAY from Cedar City to St. George, Utah.....so slow down on I-15, visit Kolob Canyon and Kolob Arch.

Zion's Main Canyon,"This is a huge, huge park! Trams run regularly to connect the major hiking spots and lodge buildings. Upon admission to the park, you are provided with a large map with tram stops marked on it, as well as places for rest rooms and places to obtain drinking water. Prepare for some serious walking!The hiking is not very stressful; the trails we traveled seem to have gentle inclines and the paths were well maintained. We saw all age groups on these trails.And the views! Such beauty! We saw a concave opening that looked like an ancient amphitheater, similar to ones we'd seen in Athens near the Parthenon. We half-expected to see a Yanni concert underway! We traveled on two of the most popular trails, past waterfalls and pools, and felt we got a greater appreciation by hiring a private guide (Southwest Adventure tours) as we spent less time trying to identify formations from the map or figuring out where the most interesting trails were located.You could easily spend an entire week here and probably not see everything there was to see. There is so much! The lodge resort in the park is pricey but maybe it would be a nice splurge. Traveling into the park is going to take time.Our guide pointed out the big horn sheep (which we did not see at first), explained why the maidenhair ferns grow where they do, how the water seeps through the rocks (a trip that can take 5,000 years), and other trails we should consider at a later time on our own. The park is big and can be a little overwhelming. If you can obtain the map/info sheet ahead of time, it will be better than most guide books (which we also had). The website is www.nps.gov/zion and the park's telephone number is 435-772-3256. We loved this park!","August 21, 2014",Wonderful day!,1378,Tucson,5

The shuttles are frequent and provide some information. Allow time for the drive to the park . East of the park is a tunnel which often backs up, since they shut it down to one was to allow large rev's etc. to go through. There is an extra charge for this. For full enjoyment go in the off months if you can. The shuttles can be crowed.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Our family traveled for 2 weeks mainly to Canyon like attractions...Mesa Verde, GC, Zion, Bryce, Arches....Zion easily stood out as everyone's favorite. By far. You are in the canyon looking up and around, not down like the others. The park is fantastically maintained due to the policy to restrict passenger vehicles in the actual park areas and only allow shuttle buses. The grounds and trails are well maintained and the minimalistic intrusion by the park services, when originally creating the park, made Zion the best overarching experience we had. The views are just fantastic. The colors, the sheer cliffs and towering walls, the varied rock formations, the flora and fauna, the NARROWS!, the other trails, the town of Springdale, just a quick 10 min drive south, was perfectly in tune with what Zion is all about.I could list all that was great and you can check out specific reviews for Narrows, etc but let's just say: Narrows: Best.Hike.Ever. Just make sure you get the neoprene socks and shoes. The Emerald Pools were cool. Easy walking at the bottom to get to the first pool, harder as you climbed to the top pool. Its a grind if you are hiking it in the middle of the day. Those who correctly stay for more than one day at Zion should go for it and stay in the Lodge. It is an awesome location with easy access to everything the park has to offer.I give Zion an A+....for ""The Christmas Story"" fans....A+ + + !!!! I wish I was back there right now and would go again a heartbeat. That's how good Zion was and hopefully stays for generations to come. A true treasure.","August 17, 2014",Zion is an A+.

We decided to try the river walk - about a mile I think - and WE MADE IT very comfortably. Then we decided maybe we could tackle the waterfall trail, and that was nice and very rewarding. It is soooo great to stand under the waterfall when you are tired and hot. How refreshing. We met several other walkers from Germany and somehow we all communicated what a nice trail it was ahead and how cool the water would be when they got to that point.

Was skeptical about the shuttle system since I like to drive and be ""in control"" but it works great! Have to get to the park early in busy summer months to get parking. Shuttles run both directions every few minutes so easy to jump on and off to get to different stops and trails. Tons of trail options for every level of activity. Do need to plan for the day - only restaurants are at the Lodge and can be crowded and are a bit expensive. Although the awesome giant ice cream cone I had was worth every dime of $3 after two hikes on hot summer day!

Our favorites were hiking The Narrows -- definitely rent water socks/shoes -- and Canyon Overlook Trail -- phenomenal views!You can only drive so much in this park and then you have to use the shuttle buses.

We hiked some of the more popular routes to see the famous scenery. We saw waterfalls, pools and wildlife. But the number and noise of other people took away from the enjoyment of the natural beauty. Zion is a very beautiful park with awe inspiring views.Kolob Canyon, on the east side of the park, was well worth visiting and much quieter. I'm a city slicker who likes to visit National parks to get away from noise and congestion. Some parts of Zion seemed a bit too much like Disney.

Zion's Main Canyon,This is a great park. The hiking is diverse and there is something for everyone. The park shuttle was great. That saved a lot of time looking for parking. The Emerald Pools loop trail was beautiful. If you are brave and in reasonably good shape try the Angels Landing trail. It is a good workout with 1400+ foot elevation gain. The last section is over rock along a steep ridge with chains to hang onto. If you have a fear of heights you can stop at the Scout Lookout right before the rock scramble/chain assisted part of the hike begins. The view from there is great as well. Not a good hike for your kids as there are lots of places to fall off of. Start the hike early (by 9am) and take lots of water.

Bring water shoes or an extra pair of tennis shoes, and protection for your camera - there are ""walking"" sticks lined up at the entrance to the river you are welcome to use and just put back for the next person. Late afternoon sun was wonderful to take pictures. We had lunch at the restaurant attached to the main lodge in Zion - really appreciate that they have locations to refill your water bottles.

There is no cell phone reception here or limited at best - so peaceful to look around and see families talking and everyone not engaged with their phones - but each other - the atmosphere feels healthy!

Zion's Main Canyon,"We were staying in St George and took two different day trips to see Zion. The first day we made the mistake of not even trying to park inside the park. We took the Springdale Shuttle to the Zion shuttle, but had standing room only because we were the last stop. It's hard to do with 4 small kids (one in a back carrier), lunches, extra supplies (like diapers), and a camera to carry. Once we walked through the fee gate our group of 10 got on a Zion shuttle (although I think we cut in front of another group of waiting people, not sure, but there were no clear lines and it was so hot already at 10am). On the shuttle we tried to hear the tour recording, but there was a loud mouth behind us who wanted to let everyone know about her adventurous life. The views were amazing from the shuttle and we got to our destination (the Narrows) in about 45 minutes or less. The mile long river walk was ok with stops along the way to get into the Virgin River if one so desired. At the end of the river walk hike was a crowded pile up of people waiting for others or resting. They recommend having good hiking/water shoes, and a hiking stick/pole.The Outfitter store also sells neoprene socks (wetsuit for your toes), but people complained about them when they were hiking on dry land. Although I saw many types of shoes being worn and people with 2, 1, or no sticks I think everyone who came to the Narrows had some kind of adventure (I tell my kids an adventure is something you are doing that you have no idea the outcome, but you should still try it none the less). Advice: I took off my jogging shoes and put on water shoes, big mistake! I should have had more support/protection under my arches. I wish my hiking sandals didn't break right before the trip (I guess it's better than during the trip). Also, I carried my youngest in a carrier on my back part of the way. That made my experience more trying and difficult. I had 5 other adult friends with me so I didn't have to worry about my other 3 young kids who were having a blast getting soaking wet. At one point one of my daughters lost her shoes twice. Each time we walked or swam down the river a ways and someone was putting the lost shoe in a place easy to find again. I lost my one of my own shoes that were tied to to the baby carrier on my back and found it tied to a tree near the entrance of the Narrows. So cool!!! I wanted to go further up the Narrows but I think I'm going to have to wait till my youngest is able to walk more on her own and next time I'll wear good hiking sandals. The walking stick was a life saver a few times.","July 14, 2014",Adventures await,19,Santa Clarita,4

Zion's Main Canyon,"Great drive with nice views. Cost to go through the park is $25 plus if you have a big Vehicle another 20 each way. The $25 is good for 7 days in all National parks or you can buy a 1 year pass for like $75 or if you are over 62 a life pass for $10. The tunnels you go through are fun (this is why the extra charge for big stuff, anything over 8' wide or 11 high) They shut the road down 1 way each time for them to go through, so plan on stopping for 20 mins each way as there are tons of busses and rv's all year long. Takes about 2 hours to round trip it if you make a couple of stops. If you are staying in the area you can do both Zion and Bryce Canyon on the same day. Just go through Zion to Glendale and head north on 89 for 50 miles and you will see the turn off for Bryce.

If you plan to visit, check the maps ahead of time and come prepared to traverse steep hills and cold rivers on foot. Zion doesn't allow cars but has timely trams that ferry folks to each scenic point in an effort to alleviate traffic.

Pa'rus trail ends about a mile up the Zion Canyon and you join the ""red permit restricted road"" up the main Canyon road used only by the Zion Shuttles and Zion Lodge overnight visitors so little traffic. The entire trip is 8 miles mostly uphill but only 600' vertical feet climb. It felt like a good portion of that was on the way up to the Court of the Patriarchs. This is a better way to view the canyon than via the shuttle bus with 360 views and at a slower pace (going up). Lots of deer and birds to see along the way. Stopped at the Lodge for a beer on the way down which made it even more enjoyable. Much faster back than out. 2 hour rental if you are a biking hammer or with no Lodge break. 3 hours if taking a more leisurely pace.","June 29, 2014",Bike it!,45,"Charlotte, North Carolina, United States",5

We hiked on this special ""trail"" for 4 hours but less time and especially longer times can be spent as well to suit your capabilities.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion national park is something we underestimated. The drive to it wasn't spectacular or something until we drove through the tunnel and entered the canyon. It was breathtaking. So much green and the Navajo sandstone had so much different colors. The wildlife was just minding their own business even if we drove slowly along them. We parked our car at the visitors center, which is usually full. From there a shuttle drove us towards the hikes and they have audio, which sounds just like Tom Hanks, who tell's the story behind the Virgin river and the canyon. The drive till the end is not long. From there we took a nice hike upstream and we also had to wade through the water. It was fun! Also there is enough places to hike. The restaurant is great, much better than the Grand canyon.

Zion's Main Canyon,Went here week after Memorial Weekend. Parking was bit of a problem as it filled up early but place was beautiful. You can't actually drive around the park. They have a free shuttle bus service that takes you to different locations throughout the park. Best to park in the town right OUTSIDE the park and catch the free shuttle to the park. You then have to walk over a bridge to get in the park and get to a shuttle to take you around. Shuttle comes quite frequently. We took shuttle to the end and worked our way back. Less crowded that way (we thought). Nice museum with a short beautiful movie. Little shopping center before entering park that includes movie theater and grocery store and you can even get a shower there for $5. ,"June 18, 2014",WOW what beauty,22,"Camas, Washington",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"The shuttle service is really good for this, as it runs often, and has info about all the stuff along the way. Make sure you get out and walk around some of the stops, as there is a lot to see in the canyon.

Zion's Main Canyon,We rented a car from Vegas and drove to Zion with our 3 adult children. We stopped at a Walmart on the way in St. George right off the freeway because we booked a suite at Pioneer Lodge in Springfield so we picked up groceries. The drive only took about 3 hours and most of the ride was scenic leading up to Zion so the drive went by fast for us.We hiked a paved path to Riverside Walk and waded in the water. It was about 100 degrees that day and had to stop several times to fuel up with water and cool off. It's a long hike in the heat.My favorite part was the scenic drive through the canyon. It has plenty of look out points and the sun was setting. It was the most beautiful thing we've ever seen!We started to hike up Canyon Overlook but 2 of us chickens had to turn around while the other 3 brave one's continued to hike up the side of the mountain. It's a more difficult hike but they said it was worth it because you seen a view of the whole canyon.We enjoyed this more than Grand Canyon and the drive was shorter. Drinking fountains were accessible but I felt there should have been more of them along the routes. They also need more trash containers. People were leaving empty water bottles on the ground.Words cant describe this park. You have to see it first hand because you can't take in the 360 views with pictures.The hotels just outside the park are surrounded by mountains and there's shops along the way. We ended our day at Pioneer Lodge where we barbecued steaks and ate dinner on an outside porch and enjoyed a little more of Zion. It was perfect and a nice short get away from the excitement of Vegas which we were also happy to return to. See my review on Pioneer Lodge if you wish.,"June 14, 2014",Don't want to miss this,77,Taylor,5
Zion's Main Canyon,"This hike is highly recommended. Access for it is across from Zion Lodge, the trail is clearly marked and the incline is not bad to the first pool. The waterfall coming over the ledge was beautiful and was enhanced by a beautiful butterfly flitting in and out of the water. The hike to the second pool is a bit more of an incline so go only if you feel you can. The third pool is much more of an incline. The first and second are doable. Then hike back via The Grotto (the lower path). You can catch a bus back to the lodge when you are done or just walk back along the Virgin River. Have fun and take water, camera and walking stick.","June 14, 2014",Hike to the Emerald Pools in Zion,12,,4
Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion National Park is a very popular destination in Utah and for a very good reason. The scenery is absolutely beautiful! We took a few different hikes and each one provided something different and interesting. Pa'rus trail is an easy, level, paved hike along the river. The lower, middle and upper Emerald Pools trails were good and somewhat challenging since there's a lot of stairs and inclines to hike but the final destination (Upper Emerald Pool) was a nice sanctuary and good place to take in the scenery, have a snack and rest up for the hike back down. The lower Emerald Pool had some refreshing small waterfalls that lightly sprayed the hikers. Due to knee issues, we didn't do any of the other hikes. We'd love to go back someday and check out other trails. TIPS about the park: You cannot drive all around the park unless you have a special pass. Visitors MUST ride the shuttle to get around to the different trails. The shuttles are convenient, informative and very regular. Arrive BEFORE 10 am!!!!!!! There's limited parking at the Visitor's Center (where you catch the park's shuttle) and that lot fills up quickly. (A park ranger told us that the busiest times are from 10 am to 3 pm daily.) We arrived around 10:30 am on a Wednesday and couldn't find a place to park! Frustrated at how crowded it was, we left and decided to come back the next day. Thursday we arrived around 8:00 am, found a place to park and hiked our trails with very few other people. That was nice! You can park outside of the park in the town of Springdale and either walk into the park or grab one of the shuttles that takes you into the park. The town gets filled up with cars as well so plan your trip ahead of time. The town has all the amenities: gas, food, lodging, shopping, gift stores, etc. If you plan it right, Zion is a wonderful place to visit!","June 13, 2014",Beautiful and Popular!

Zion's Main Canyon,"After viewing the South rim of the Grand Canyon, and traveling along the East rim scenic drive to the North rim of Grand Canyon, which was closed from rock slide and wintery conditions, we decided to go to Zion National Park as an alternative side trip. What a great choice. On the drivey to the park we left in warmer weather and as we got higher in the mountains we encountered a snow storm which being from Louisiana was totally awesome. The scenery was gorgeous as we entered the canyon and was like a reverse of the Grand Canyon looking up. The mountains were amazing with beautiful colors, the reds contrasting with the greenery and snowy peaks. We viewed the park in slight chilly and rainy conditions, but the beauty made up for this slight inconvenience. My wife and I spent the entire day taking in the natural beauty from the waterfalls to the deer and other wildlife wandering the mountain sides. We also enjoyed a nice lunch and souvenirs at the shops in the park. This is a well worth visit and would have loved to spend more time here, but we only had one day to take in this majestic park.","June 12, 2014",BOTTOMS UP Spectacular view of Mother Nature,91,"Abita Springs, Louisiana",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"What a grand experience! We drove up almost to Bryce Canyon (that is a future trip to be sure) as we had missed the exit from Vegas... So, now we had less time there than we'd liked.The scenery is beautiful with lots of colors - green, white, beige, brown & some rust/red. Many high mountains to climb up the canyons & cool rivers in the valleys. Lots of shadows from the sun & from the many mountains. Very interesting. Lovely deer & many birds in the canyon.Great temperature differences in hiking upward against beating sun vs walking in shade areas. Good sturdy hiking shoes a must & if you plan to hike in the bottom, in the river as well, invest in land/water boots. No water sneakers here as it;s slippery on the bottoms & can be rocky. A walking stick is also a good idea! We had neither so just hiked in gym shoes best we can. It is just so Lovely & Huge with many many hiking trails at various difficulties. As we were rushing along, we accidentally went onto a very long, steep difficult trail when we missed the turnoff onto the one we meant to hike. Soooo after many steep steps, turns later, we run into the only people we encountered on this trail coming down & realized we were enroute to top of the peak & will arrive in maybe another 7+ hours. So, take your time following the maps on the trails you choose. There is a free shuttle that is very useful for getting to every point you like to stop at!

Zion's Main Canyon,"I visited Zion National Park with Gran Canyon Tour from Las Vegas. While I would recommend visiting this park, I would not go with that tour company because it charges a lot mainly for transportation, no stops along the way besides at a gas station for restroom. I had to beg the driver to stop at an Indian Trading Post, where I know most tour companies stop in that area. Our driver Tess would not stop at any souvenir shop in Springville just outside the park on the road with beautiful quartz rocks, saying she is not paid if she drives overtime. The driver did not come with us on the park shuttle saying the park would not allow it, instead another driver from Pink Jeep tours said it is not true. Before leaving I was told not to bring a swimming suit, so I could not enjoy wading and swimming in the river. There was not enough time to see all the Emerald Pools, just the first, beautiful. Lunch was a joke. They say it is included at the park lodge but then it is limited to $14.95 which I used for the buffet $12.95. Other companies offer sack lunch on the grass under the shade, better choice to have more time to see the park. f you have a rental car, you can do all the stops you want, you can stay as long as you want, you can also visit Bryce Canyon nearby and you would see the same things a guide would tell you along the way just reading the signs. The colors of Zion are beautiful, with the contrast of the red rocks, the green trees and the blue sky. A different perspective than being in the Grand Canyon, as here you see the Canyon from the ground up and not from top down.","June 8, 2014",Nice trip from Las Vegas,311,seattle,4

Shuttles run every 5-10 minutes and the drivers are great. Smooth ride even if you are standing (nothing like city buses). Everyone is friendly.It doesn't matter if you take a long hike or short hike there are no bad views.Hiked up to Emerald Ponds.

Rising up out of the valley, we trekked to the three ponds. It was hot in the canyon, but having the waterfalls, and a place to soak my neck handkerchief made the hike all worth it. Vistas everywhere! Incredible peaks, amazing natural beauty were surrounding us. The hike was about 3.1 miles round trip, following natural water flows as well as the river.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We did the Subway bottom up after winning lottery tickets. We did a lot of research to avoid getting lost going back to the caynon. We still got lost but at the part most unexpected...So our journey started:We got to the trail head early in the morning around 8AM. We started walking down one of the social trails from the ""toilet"". We read that all trails lead to the same path so we took the one on the right. We walked until we got to a dry creek with sand and rocks. From there we made another right and walked straight. After 10 minutes we found ourselves at the edge of a cliff. After realizing there is no way down and we made the wrong turn we headed back to where we started. There is a big tree root on the left (signaling where we were before we made the wrong right turn). We decided to go straight (left instead of right at the dry creek) and then made another right at the split. After a few minutes we noticed some trails on the right with wooden steps. We took that right and follow the path for 15 minutes before we finally reach the top and the beginning of the descent to left fork canyon. At the bottom you'll see a sign for Left fork, keep in mind that is your exit for later when heading back. We contemplated between walking in the water or staying on the side of river banks. After attempts of walking in the water, we realized each side has a social trail to help navigate. The trail is made socially so at times it is not easy to navigate and you'll have to figure out where to go next. You'll have to cross the river, walk on rocks, stone hop until you reach to the subway. It's a difficult 4 miles to the subway. The subway itself is short and quick. Once you reach the pools many people continue the chest deep water until there is a waterfall. We didn't attempt because the water is very cold. We stopped where the pool started and watched people rappel down from the Top down version.Heading back was tedious because we didn't remember which social trail we came from. i left rocks and hints to get back but we never saw my hints or trails. At one point (the three hour return mark) we got nervous that we had missed the exit and every black rock/caynon looked the same to us. Luckily my husband wanted to push forward even though I wanted to back track. 5 minutes later we found the sign for the Left Fork Trail. We continued up the caynon.We got back to the dry creek, made a left (because we took a right earlier) and then took a right at the tree root/branch. After that we got completely lost. The thought that ""every trail leads to the same place"" made us think that we were heading in the right direction when we made an attempt at one of the social trails. Unfortunately we got lost, backtracked our steps, found other hikers who were convinced they were going the right way (where we came from) so we followed them with the same results. We ended up on the side of the road. Luckily another hiker realized the parking lot at the trail head was back, so we walked on the street back to the parking lot.If we had to do over, at the dry creek, instead of backtracking our step (taking a left and then a right at the branch) we should have followed the footsteps and walked straight. Most people went that way based on the discolored sand but we wanted to be sure by walking back the way we came from and got completely lost.In conclusion, the subway is amazing but for the effort it took for us to get there bottom up, we probably wouldn't do it again. We should have learned to rappel and done top down. We didn't enjoy bottom up and we didn't see much.","June 7, 2014",Subway bottom up,29,"Boston, Massachusetts",4

Zion's Main Canyon,"To paraphrase the Zion National Park introductory video, ""You can worship in these canyons just as well as you could within the walls of a church."" (I forgot who the quote is attributed to, and I have been unable to locate the quote online since)A trip up Zion's Main Canyon was wonderfully peaceful, even on the very busy Saturday before Memorial Day. Busloads and busloads of visitors poured into the park, but my husband and I still found ourselves alone frequently. I highly recommend getting to the park early. I had a problem adjusting to the altitude the first morning I was in Utah, and we had a late start due to it (you may want to pack some ibuprofen if you even think that this may happen to you). We got to the park around 10 a.m., and the lot for the park was already closed. We parked in the nearby Springdale and caught the shuttle into the park. It's hard to miss the shuttle stops, and they were running about every eight minutes when we were there. Before you get on the bus, do not forget sunscreen and a water bottle. You will need both of them.We bought an annual pass for the national parks (my home park, the Great Smoky National Park, does not have an admission fee, but all of the national parks in Canyon Country that we visited did). If you are going to visit more than three, it is worth the price (note that if you visit Lake Powell, you can also use the pass to enter that area as well). The park does take cards, which was a relief as I rarely carry cash.My husband and I decided to tour the park via the shuttle (there wasn't any other choice, really, as the road to the main canyon was closed to private vehicles). There are eight stops along the trail, and I was disappointed that only a hand full of people got off at each stop. Most seemed to be holding off to get off at the last stop to visit the Narrows. However, we found something special at each one. I enjoyed the museum and its movie, running my hand through the Virgin River at the River Run stop, and exploring the lodge.My husband is not a big hiker, but I really wanted to do at least one trail. I picked the Grotto Trail, which according to the park guide, was the shortest. In hindsight, I regret this choice. The trail didn't have spectacular views. If we return, I will try to convince him to try the Emerald Pools trails. These seem to have better views and are among one of the easier trails.I also recommend taking your lunch if possible. The dining options in the Main Canyon are limited. You will enjoy a picnic in the park or along a trail more than fighting the crowds at the Lodge to eat. The views of the park are gorgeous. During our time in Canyon Country, I was surprised at how green Zion is. It combined the majesty of rock canyons, riverside, and lush forests. If you only have one day in Zion, such as we did, I recommend concentrating your time exploring the Main Canyon to explore this peaceful, inspiring place.","June 2, 2014",Breathtakingly Peaceful,133,"Knoxville, Tennessee",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"Unless you are a fit and experienced mountaineer there are not too many trails you can do as an average hiker (like us).These were our favorites:1. Emerald poolsStart at the Grotto on the Kayenta trail, go up to the upper Emerald pool and then come down to the middle and lower Emerald pools. The pools themselves are not so spectacular but the landscape and the views surely are. Unfortunately thousand other people will do the trail at the same time, so forget about tranquility, especially if you share a pool with 30 noisy kids.You will probably need 3-4 hours. The trail is never dangerous but often rocky. It goes up and down a lot and you should be sure-footed.2. Watchman trailAlthough this trail is really beautiful and offers great views it seems to be underestimated. There is maybe 5% of the traffic as compared to the Emerald trails. It is easier to walk but goes up quite steeply most of the time. There is little shade and on a sunny day it can be very hot. It took us 3 -4 hours including a long break at the end of the trail.

The upper pool is a great place to relax and have a picnic before returning. The trail to the upper pool takes about 2.5 hours to complete round-trip.We also enjoyed the very short hike to the weeping wall and horseback riding with the Canyon Trail Rides.

Zion's Main Canyon,"My husband and I just did a week-long trip from Colorado to the Grand Canyon, Zion National Park, and Bryce Canyon. We stayed in each place about 2 days which was perfect (actually we ended up staying at Zion the longest -- for 3 days because it's just that amazing & there are so many great hikes to do!). Of course, the longer you can stay the better, but if you're crunched for time, 2-ish days was just enough time to take in the sights, do some hiking, and relax as well without feeling too rushed. (Side note: I've posted reviews for Grand Canyon & Bryce as well). SCHEDULE/OVERVIEW:At Zion, we stayed at Watchman Campground (Loop A - A7; I made a note below about South Campground also) and although I'm not high maintenance at all, wow!!...the bathrooms near us were amazing!! Didn't even seem like a campground and I've camped a lot - NICEST bathrooms by far! The campground location was AWESOME too - right by the river so you could hear the steady stream of water and there's a paved walking path along the river too that you can take a leisurely walk down in the morning/afternoon/evenings with friends/family/solo and it's so relaxing. Also, you can walk or bicycle right down the river path for only a few minutes and it will take you directly to the visitor center and shuttles where you can access the rest of the park -- no car needed! The first day we did the Emerald Pools trails - Lower, Mid, and Upper which were fantastic. Bring your camera! The lower pool is an easy, relatively flat hike that anyone can do (young or old!) and the middle and upper pools are more moderate hikes that aren't that far and well worth the view! I saw families with kids doing these trails also, but some were tired and others didn't have proper shoes -- definitely wear tennis or hiking shoes. It wasn't too bad at all for us to get all the way to the top because every few minutes we were stopping anyway to take pictures because the views are absolutely phenomenal!! Day 2 we did 'the Narrows' hike -- one of the BEST hikes I've ever done! Hop off the shuttle at Temple of Sinawava and it's a flat, leisurely 1-mile walk to the river. If you have young kids, you can go just this far and sit/play/relax in the river. It's a perfect stopping point! If you're up for an unbelievable, yet challenging hike - keep going & hike through the river down the Narrows between the canyon walls. It's spectacular! DO NOT wear flipflops! You will fall over or slip and slide everywhere and be stressed. I saw a few people attempting this (yikes!). DO bring a hiking stick or pole! You will absolutely need it because the river currents are relatively strong in places. Some people rented canyoning shoes with water booties for this hike, but we went the 3rd week of May and it wasn't nearly as cold as I was expecting so we didn't rent any other gear - we just wore hiking shoes with good tread, shorts (you'll definitely get wet!), and we brought 1 hiking pole each. You can hike the Narrows as long as you want & turn back whenever you want. The longer you can stay the better because it's so much fun and absolutely gorgeous so give yourself plenty of time --- we did it for about 3-4 hours (could've & should've gone A LOT longer!). When we finished, we hopped back on the shuttle and did the Weeping Rock trail (easy 1/2 mile paved, slightly uphill) on the way back, which is also a MUST-SEE! So glad we didn't overlook this... we took some of our best pictures here! Overall, Zion has been one of our favorite national parks so far! Everyone should go there & see yourself -- there's no way to be disappointed, even from the moment you enter the park (with mile-long rock tunnels) and red rock paved roads... truly indescribable!OTHER NOTES: Questions? Need help? -- The shuttle drivers are extremely helpful and will direct, help and guide you & answer any questions you have... you won't get lost! And you do not need a car once you get to the visitor center & campground area -- shuttle access is so easy!Facilities? Food? -- There are shuttle stops with lots of restroom facilities and the lodge has food/cafeteria as well. And there are good gift shops at the Visitor Center & the lodge.RECOMMENDATIONS:Make sure you have a reservation for a place to stay/camp! There were no vacancies when we were there the 3rd week of May for Watchman Campground where we had reserved a spot for 2 nights. But then we ended up wanting to stay at Zion for another night, so we heard that South Campground had first-come, first-serve camping which we thought we'd be able to get easily (wrong!) -- we woke up and drove over there (it's only a few minutes away.. they're right down the road from one another, and both great locations!) at 7:30 a.m. There were already lots of cars circling the campground looking for open sites, but since many people were still sleeping (versus leaving/checking out of the campground), being there so early was almost irrelevant - if you're there by 8:30 a.m. I think you'd be fine. We circled the campground until around 9am. Some people got spots who were overly determined - waiting by sites for hours, waking up sleeping people in their actual tents to see if they were checking out that day, etc... but I thought that was pretty ridiculous and rude, so we left after a while. A few hours later after we checked out of Watchman, we drove back over and had a picnic at the entrance (there's a nice spot with trees and picnic tables) and then after that drove through the campground one last time and IRONICALLY a guy just walked over to our car & offered us his spot that he didn't need anymore! Needless to say, DO NOT expect that to happen -- we were super lucky and ended up offering to share our spot with others later who had been circling around the campground for a while looking for place to stay (great idea by the way... share your spot & share the cost with others if you can!). Overall, South Campground is more minimalist (very, very, very small bathrooms; no frills at all compared to Watchman), but location is also good and staying in both were perfect for us!Other recommendations -- sunscreen! layers of clothing (it's COLD at night & really HOT during the day)! hiking poles! good shoes! bring your camera EVERYWHERE - everywhere you look you will be amazed!Enjoy your trip! It will be awesome!!!","May 26, 2014","Grand Canyon, Zion, and Bryce 1-week trip -- PERFECT!!",39,"Denver, Colorado",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"We entered the park via the Zion – Mt. Carmel Highway on our way from Bryce Canyon to Las Vegas; this very scenic drive makes it a good introduction to the park. The day we visited was a Saturday in early May and the place was packed. All the car parks were full and we had to park in Springdale, which is just outside the South entrance. This isn't a problem as there is a pedestrian entrance from here which takes you to the Visitor Centre. Free shuttle buses will take you from here to the various stops and trails in Zion Canyon (you have to use the buses as private cars are not allowed in the Canyon). There are plenty of walking trails of varying difficulty and the ones you choose will be dictated by your timetable and fitness!. Full details of the trails are available at the Visitor Centre. The views and majestic cliffs are well worth the visit.A tip. If you are visiting more than 3 National Parks it is worth getting an annual pass. At the time of our visit (May 2014) this was $80. With normal entry charges being $25 or $20 this soon pays for its self.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Spectacular, but the valley is loved to death: full of obnoxious crowds. We went on the first Saturday in May; before the tourists I thought; ha! big mistake. Example: after about an hour’s mid-morning hike to Upper Emerald Pool we found it crowded; it was not just that: one group of six was obnoxiously loud, whereas a quiet evangelical group of 30-40 decided that it was quite OK for them to gather in a large circle right in the center of things holding hands and hugging (and occasionally performing an silent exorcism) for 20 or more minutes, ruining the atmosphere and scenery for everyone else. The trail at the far end of the valley could have been Fifth Avenue. So many were discussing going up Angel’s Rest I dread to think of the line there (we didn’t check). My only advice would be to go mid-week in February or November! (Try much more pleasant Capitol Reef instead!) On the plus side we had a very pleasant lunch on the veranda of the restaurant of the main lodge, which was not crowded, at a price that must have been no more than the crowded cafeteria.","May 21, 2014",Don't go on a weekend or in season: far too crowded,96,Ithaca NY,2
Zion's Main Canyon,"My nineteen-year-old son, brother-in-law, and I just spent three nights camping and hiking in Zion National Park. It is a beautiful place and the hiking was amazing. Make a reservation for a camp site in advance at Watchman Campground. Otherwise, be at the South Campground by 8 a.m. for a first come, first serve site or you will miss out. The shuttle system is easy and convenient to use. The little town of Springdale is convenient for food, groceries, and espresso (Deep Creek Coffee). Your hiking options are fantastic! ""The Narrows"" up the Virgin River was one of my top hikes ever! However, spend the 20 bucks and rent neoprene hiking shoes and hiking stick in town. It will be a great investment. Angels Landing was also an incredible hike, but is also very strenuous. The narrow ridge to the summit is down right scary. We completed two hikes per day and had a wonderful experience. The map and guide (newspaper) you receive at the entrance gate provided all the information we needed.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Absolutely wonderful park. If you are visiting several national parks, buy the annual National Park Pass or the senior pass. Parking at the park is not possible unless you get there early in the day, but park anywhere in Springdale town and you can get on the free shuttle which has convenient stops and runs frequently. The Park is unbelievably beautiful. Everywhere is a tremendous view. We started at the Visitor Center where rangers review maps and give advice on what to do based on your length of visit (hours or days) and your fitness level. They have wonderful free printed guides that tell about hiking trails, degree of difficulty and estimated length in distance and time to complete the trail. Good footwear, adequate water and snack food are necessities for hiking.

We were told that Visitor Center parking fills up and to park in Springdale, but both times we went we found spots. Shuttles are very full coming back down the canyon in the afternoon. Be patient.The café at Zion lodge did not have anything healthy or particularly fresh. You are better off stopping in Spingdale to get provisions for the day. But the lawn and/or rocking chairs in front of the lodge make a good spot for picnics or breaks in general.","May 11, 2014",Lots of options,108,"Arlington, VA",5

If you don't arrive before about 10:00am, you will have to park at the parking areas in Springdale and ride the free shuttle into the park. The main canyon shuttles stop at all the hiking trails. Each shuttle can also accommodate up to two bikes. Riding the bikes down from the head of the canyon to the visitor center is a great way to see the canyon, is you are up to the exercise.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We were heading from Vegas to Bryce and thought we pop into Zion on the way - only you don't pop in, you have to drive though and if you're in an RV you're charged an additional 15USD for them to close the tunnel to Bryce Canyon. When you consider they take 15USD off all the RVs and drive 10-15 vehicles though in convoy, this seems a bit steep. We were there at the weekend and the place was packed - it's not the largest park and everyone congregates in the same place. They do have a great shuttle which makes the 25USD entry fee a bit more worthwhile but we would have avoided this park if we could given there are so many other totally awesome things to see in southern Utah.","May 4, 2014",Crowded and not RV friendly!,7,"Zurich, Switzerland",3

We must have stopped a half dozen times between the east gate and the visitor's center (which was about 12 miles) for photos and to marvel at the beauty of the place. We boarded the main canyon shuttle and were awed by the views. We saw hikers, bikers, rock climbers as well as various rock formations.

Also nice but we prefer the cabins. We hiked to the emerald pools and along the river walk. The second day we rode horses to see the three prophets then hiked the trail behind the visitors centre.

Bryce Canyon, another must see, is just another one hour drive away from Zion. I have stayed at Rubey's Inn! Which is at the entrance to the Canyon. They have cute cabins that are affordable. They have a pool and during the summer months they have a small rodeo. And yes they do have horses to rent. Summer months are great to go to both parks.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion really is an extraordinary place with plenty to see for all ages and capabilities from an easy stroll along the Virgin river between the towering red rock canyon walls, to the more demanding hikes through 'The Narrows', [IN the Virgin river] but you must check conditions and hire some wet gear from town for this hike. Angels landing is another challenge which is not for kids or anyone with a fear of heights ! There are many others to choose from inbetween these extremes, such as the Emerald Pools trail [different stages] and Weeping rock. The Rangers are always at hand any only too pleased to advise you what to expect along the many trails. You are surrounded by breathtaking scenery that alters with the light, and an abundance of wildlife. I would recommend a minimum of one full day to visit Zion [2 nights in the area] and that will more than likely leave you kicking yourself for not allowing more time. The nearest town to the park is the wonderful Springdale which is located near to the entrance and ideal for lodging and dining if you are not actually staying in the NP lodgings.. From town you can get on the free shuttle bus into the canyon area which avoids having to drive in and find parking. Note that cars are not allowed into the canyon area and the free shuttle buses are the only transport in. If you are visiting more than 4 main National parks in a year then you could save money and purchase the NP annual pass for $80 which is a real bargain !","March 15, 2014",A real gem !,254,"West Sussex, United Kingdom",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"We spent four nights, three full days in Zion. (We didn’t get up to the Kolob Canyon area of the park.) Daytime temperatures in late September were very pleasant for hiking (high 70’s), but cool in early morning, and downright chilly after sunset (sweatshirts and long pants recommended). We stayed at the Zion Lodge, highly recommended: renovated cabins with fireplaces and porches, in a central location of the park, easy access to the shuttle going both north and south, access to the only eating venues in the park (both quick foods and sit-down restaurants), and in a beautiful setting surrounded by tall, sandstone walls; perfect for relaxing and enjoying sunrise and sunset and dark, starry skies (don’t miss the night skies!). We’re seniors, like to hike, and felt this was enough time to enjoy the park. During our stay, we hiked five trails, approximately nine miles total; some more challenging than others. We were going to hike the Narrows, but the water in the Narrows was very, very cold; although some hearty souls did hike into the Narrows anyway. We hiked the Pa’rus Trail on what turned out to be a “free day” where you could enter the park free; we were surprised that on a free day with tons of visitors, we were essentially alone on this beautiful trail that follows the Virgin River; highly recommend trail; plan at least two hours to three to enjoy. We rode the shuttle system often; very efficient way to save time getting to the trail heads. We photographed sunset from the bridge at Canyon Junction. Our last day, after a morning hike, we rode the shuttle down into Springdale and had lunch at Pioneer Restaurant; delicious , hearty and relaxing. As it turned out, after visiting the five beautiful Utah National parks (a trip we planned a year in advance), we checked out of Zion on October 1, the day the government shut down.

If there is a place anywhere on earth with more brilliant beauty than this area, I've not heard of it.","November 11, 2013",Another extraordinary national park in Utah,252,"Durham, North Carolina",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Not that you're dying.... just catch this place once in your life. The main canyon is easily accessible for all ages and types, with mild to wild walks easily accessible from the pleasant commuter bus. It's all beautiful. Access is so much easier than that other famous Canyon (Grand). The town at the entrance is a pleasant place to stay with many dining and lodging options, unlike that other famous canyon. If you have a car, take the drive to the relatively unknown northern entrance for more fabulous sites and a whole different topography and cooler climate. If you have a bike, there's an easy bike path along the first 3 miles of the canyon's river that's simply amazing.","November 7, 2013",See this park before you die!,7,"Guadalajara, Mexico",5

We're from the Midwest but we encountered many, many people from all over the world. Weather in Zion during October was perfect. Rather chilly in the early morning, but warmed up quickly once the sun hit the valley. The shuttle system in Springdale and Zion is very convenient. The park has much nicer facilities than we expected for a national park. Nice visitor center, museum, shuttle shelters, etc. Many great trails, some smoothly paved. Overall, we were very impressed, both with the natural beauty and also the overall park and nearby Springdale.","October 24, 2013",Incredible!,11,"Lafayette, Indiana",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"We stayed in the park at Zion Lodge for 2 nights, and greatly enjoyed the beauty of the canyon. Great hikes. We enjoyed the Emerald Pools trail, which becomes a little steep and uneven as you approach the upper pool, but persevere - it's the most beautiful of the pools. Wear good hiking boots or shoes on all the trails, and bring hiking poles to help with balance over uneven steps and rocks. CARRY water! The trail to the lower pool is paved and gradual, and probably accessible to wheelchairs, with assistance. Consult a ranger at the visitor center. The ""Parus"" trail (I hope that's the right spelling) is paved and almost totally level, so totally accessible to wheelchairs.The shuttles are free, 'kneel down' to make it easy to get on and off, and are wheelchair accessible. You can ride the shuttle to each of the major trail heads and viewpoints, and the narration tells you a lot about the canyon and its geography,Be sure to watch the video in the museum so as to better appreciate the geology and history of the park. And browse the selection of gifts available in the museum and the visitor center, after talking to the ranger about the various trails. The newspaper rates the trails by ease of travel - easy - moderate - strenuous.If you have little ones, there is a really good 'junior ranger' program, and the museums are very informative. And, if you are 62 or older, you can buy a senior pass at the entrance gate for $10 that gives free access to ALL National Parks for life, for as many times as you want to visit them!","October 23, 2013",Awesomely beautiful place!,178,"Berkeley, California",5

We park your car at the visitor's center and took the bus - free of charge to all the hiking/sight seeing areas. They come by every 5-10 minutes. Angel's Landing was our first stop and it was amazing. Even if you don't go all the way up to the top of Angels - go to the Scout Lookout. The views are amazing and you can watch the fearless and fearful grab the metal chain and begin the last leg to the top of Angels.After our visit to AL - we went back to the Grotto stop and grabbed a bus to the Narrows. We all enjoyed the one mile walk to the end of the trail. Then 3 of us went into the river and started walking upstream. It was challenging, cold and fun. We did not go all the way up, but did hike about 2 hours up. I suggest good hiking boots and a walking stick.","October 21, 2013",Zion's National Park - Angels Landing & Narrows,14,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

The multicolored hues of the site are spectacular. There are many great trails to hike and lots to see. We stayed in Springdale and took the ""free"" suttle to the many sites we wanted to see.

The free shuttle that runs through the park is very informative. All the drivers we stumbled upon truly loved the park, The nearest town - Springdale - is right next door and runs a great shuttle system to get you in the park and reduce congestion.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Spent three days at Zion mid-september. Weather was good and we camped in the main campground. We lucked out with a reservation as someone had cancelled and I happened to log in to the website just after that and got the exact dates I needed. Booking well in advance to insure you are in Watchman campground is advised! Watchman is tents only! No RV's and their godforsaken generators! Bit of a pet peeve! South campground is first come first serve and isn't as nice as Watchman. That being said, I wouldn't miss Zion even if I didn't have a reservation, just a bit more hassle to get there as people are packing up so you can slide into their spot! We hiked acouple of the hikes-Angel's Landing and the Riverside Walk. Both amazing. Biking was great as generally you're only sharing the road with Shuttles. There's also a bike trail through the South campground to the main road through the park.  We enjoyed the park so much that we're already talking about a return trip!","October 10, 2013",Great camping-wonderful hiking and biking,48,"Victoria, Canada",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Here you are in the bottom of a canyon rather than looking down into it at the Grand Canyon. Walls of red rock tower over you on all sides. Large pieces that have over centuries fallen off those walls offer a sobering sense of the passage of time. Many chose Zion as their very favourite park, and I can understand their passion. I preferred the top-down view but maybe because it was not such a surprise. Do not overlook Zion and insist that you enter using the amazing road heading in from the eastern side especially in the late afternoon.","October 10, 2013",Stunning reversal of the Grand Canyon,20,"Gatineau, Canada",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"On our motor coach trip through the National Parks in AZ and Utah, Zion was another masterpiece. The cliffs are among the highest in the world. In fact, our tour guide told us that in Zion, you see the sun rise in the west and set in the east. We thought, oh sure. Guess what, he was right on. Because of the high cliffs, when you first see the sun, it is shining on the west cliffs and the same is true for sunsets. You see them on the east cliffs. We stayed at the Zion Lodge for 2 nights and the shuttles stopped a short distance away. They were just great and let you see so much without all the walking. I have a problem and can not walk long distances so I loved this service. My husband did walk quite a bit and everywhere he went it was fantastic. Another National Park that should be on every ones bucket list. The natural beauty found in these parks is almost an overload for the eyes, heart and mind.","October 8, 2013",A showplace of sandstone cliffs,99,"Kenyon, Minnesota",5

Would have loved to hiked the famed Narrows, ....maybe next time. We enjoyed stopping for lunch at the Lodge...didn't like the cafeteria so we spotted the upstairs deck and headed up there.

While on bicycles we stopped MANY places and there was never anyone around. We had the road to ourself with the exception of an occasional tram. There were bike racks at the lodge and all the main tram stops along the way.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion National Park is just one incredible park, no matter how many times you may visit it. This was my third visit in seven years and my brother’s first visit. And I had goose bumps the entire day! We put in a full day of hiking on Wednesday, September 11th on a day that saw clouds, sun and rain, with temperatures about 70 degrees. We had about a 40-minute drive from Hurricane, Utah that morning and by arriving by 10am at the park entrance at Springdale, we were able to park at the visitor’s entrance parking lot. There’s not much parking there, and if you arrive at the entrance later than mid morning, you may not find a parking space. Our day consisted of taking the free park shuttle bus to its furthest stop, which was the River Walk. We hiked the entire trail, which was quite crowded. It’s a paved trail. We then rode the shuttle to the Weeping Rock stop, where among other trailheads, is the Weeping Rock Trail, also a paved trail. Here, we were given a special treat as we watched in awe as a normally dry canyon wall became almost instantaneously, a roaring torrent of water cascading over the Weeping Rock, courtesy of the rains that engulfed the area just a half hour ago. From there we got shuttled to the Grotto, where we picked up the Kayenta Trail and then the trail to the Lower Emerald Pool, which took us out to the Zion Lodge where we stopped for lunch. We ate at the cafeteria, which has very limited seating, and it’s outside. We were lucky in that the rain had let up during our lunch. Once re-energized, we boarded the shuttle for Canyon Junction, where we walked the Pa’rus Trail along the river to the Human History Museum. We ducked inside and watched the orientation movie that the park presents. It is an informative movie, well worth watching. Not wanting to leave, we decided to go back to Weeping Rock to see what was left of the waterfall we saw earlier. It was almost non-existent. Back to the shuttle to the Court of the Patriarchs where we checked out the scenery and then one last shuttle ride to the visitor’s center where we got into our car and left the park, completely awe-struck at our experience. All of the trails mentioned here offer something unique and beautiful.We aren’t very fast hikers and we aren’t in the best of shape, but we found the above itinerary of the park to be very do-able within an 8 hour day, without leaving us gasping for air, although many of the sights took our breath away! It takes in many of the highlights on the canyon floor and at the end of the day, gives you a deep appreciation of the beauty of this place.Check out the Park Newspaper on line before your visit. You'll find it very helpful.","September 24, 2013",A Full Day for the Novice,117,"Fargo, North Dakota",5

I was with Austin Lehman Adventures and can't say enough about how wonderful they are as a travel company. I never would have been as brave as I was in the Narrows which was the most awesome beautiful hike I have ever taken. We rented water shoes and a staff (which was included in the cost of the trip) from a company in town, which really helped walking on the stones in the Virgin River.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion is one of those magical locations that you can visit again and again discovering new wonders each time. Each season brings a richly rewarding experience from the first flowers of spring to the majesty of a winter's sunrise or sunset. The trails range from gentle to challenging and you can choose the level that best suits you. I first visited Zion with my parents and siblings many years ago and have continued to explore its wonders many times since. I would recommend planning several days so you can enjoy the small town of Springdale at the entrance with its unique artists shops and restaurants. Choose your areas that you want to see and those you would like to explore more thoroughly. If you have the time explore part of the narrows or if you are adventuresome hike it with a knowledgeable guide. For photographers the morning and afternoon light is spectacular so spend some time researching where you would like to capture those magical moments when the light is just perfect, constantly changing colors and angles and then gone.","September 15, 2013",Beautiful ever season of the year.,81,"Ubud, Indonesia",5

Zion National Park is a beautiful canyon, filled with cliffs, hikes, red rocks. It is located in the Southwestern United States, near Springdale, Utah. The beautiful canyon was by Mormon settlers in 1856. If you like rock climbing, and you want to take your chances, you can climb the highest peaks. There are periods in the summer where you can't climb because its too hot, but in the fall time it is perfect to climb. If you like just to hike, they have all kinds of hikes. One of the hikes they have is called the narrows. It's a hike with the river and you walk threw the river to the top of the park.its a long hike but worth the pretty views and scenery.If you have kids, one if the hikes is kid friendly. You can hike to the beginning of the narrows were it's paved. It's kid friendly and a safe hike. If you don't want to hike up the narrows, the begging of it is a safe place for your kids to swim and wade.

A word on camping, South was easy to get a campsite in by 11am on a weekday. No showers are available in the park and the ones outside of the park cost a dollar a minute.

The view is from the bottom of the canyon and the mountains tower above you. The virgin river runs through the canyon and many use that to cool down. There are several hiking routes with diferent grades of difficulty. You can also cycle through the canyon.","August 16, 2013",Wow!,53,Sedgefield,5

Zion's Main Canyon,"If you are in Vegas and you have a day with nothing planned, put on your hiking boots, and go to Zion National Park. This is one of the most accessible Canyons with dramatic scenery and fantastic hikes. Its only 3 hours slow drive form Vegas through some of the most amazing landscape. If you have more time definitely stay. I was on a one day and wanted back to Vegas early because I was flying home the next day.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We stayed in Laughlin, NV and took the 5 hours drive to the park. We read in the book to enter the park from the East. Now that added 2 hours to our arrival. The book was absolutely correct. We were not so sure until we arrived and started into the park. You start coming in with a canyon road and then the tunnel and then down down. There were no motels, resturants, gift shops as we started into the park. They are on the other end. It was so very cool. We got to the visitors center and then took the bus to the end and then took the mile walk. Should have brought water shoes and walked further into the canyon as the reiver was pretty low when we were there and it would have been a very cool walk. As it was I truely enjoyed this park. The wildlife is awsome. The deer are not afraid of people. The babies are so cute.","August 5, 2013",Excellent park for a visit,207,Muskegon Michigan,5
Zion's Main Canyon,"We spend most of a morning visiting Zion National Park as part of a 13-night escorted Globus tour from Rapid City to Las Vegas. The longish drive intot the Park was extraordinary, with a couple of tunnels including one that is over a mile long and has a few set of windows wity spectacular views but of course you can't stop and get off the bus in the tunnel.The main canyon is easily viewed at several key points, thanks to an excellent complimentary shuttle service from the Lodge up the canyon. From each stop there are a number of hiking options, some longer than others and some steeper than others. With limited time we chose cautiously, visiting the Weeping Rock and hanging gardens on a relatively short but somewhat steep climb. The reward was well worth it! From there we took the shuttle to the last stop and walked a portion of a longer hiking trail, and then returned to the lodge via shuttle to meet the bus.While not as awe inspiring as the unbelievable vistas from the rim at Bryce or Grand Canyon, Zion is a truly beautiful National Park and it would have been great to have a little more time to explore. This is well worth a visit, especially if you can combine it with the very different but close by Bryce Canyon National Park.","August 4, 2013",A short but Enjoable Visit to a Beautiful Park,32,"Millsboro, Delaware",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"I had business in Las Vegas so added a long weekend in Zion. I had been here 9 years ago with the family and have wanted to come back ever since. It is one of the premier National Parks and offers some of the best day hikes in the world. July/August are very hot and there are large crowds. If you are mindful, however, you can work around the crowds and the heat. For example, I hiked Angel's Landing but did not start until 4:30 - there were few others on the trail and the temperature was comfortable. I also hiked The Narrows - the temperature and sun is not so daunting there though you still do need to be aware. If you come in from Vegas make sure you visit the other entrance and drive the Zion - Mt Carmel Highway which is fantastic.","August 3, 2013",Return to Zion,19,"New Providence, New Jersey, United States",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Approaching the park from the east provides a dramatic introduction to the wonders of Zion. The 11-12 miles from where you enter the park until you reach the visitor's center are spectacular. Unfortunately the road is quite crowded during to summer season so pull-offs can be full and there can be a bit of a wait at the Mt. Caramel tunnel (a bit over 1 mile through a mountain--how cool is that?).Once you arrive at the Visitor's Center you may or may not find a parking spot if you're arriving mid-morning to mid-afternoon (though if you're willing to wait in the lot someone will be leaving and open up a spot for you). Earlier or later in the day are much easier to park.Zion is many people's number one destination in Utah and it really shows in the park. With just a brief time to visit it is hard to get away from the crowds. The views are very beautiful and awe-inspiring since you are at the bottom of the Canyon looking up at the rock structures that in some cases are 5,000 feet tall!Summer means being aware of flash flood potential in Zion and both days we were in the park had intense afternoon rain that washed out trails and debris down on the road. We would like to go back to Zion when the crowds are smaller and the temperatures are lower to explore the park more, but we all agreed that Zion in summertime was not our preference in parks.","August 2, 2013","Crowds, logistics, and heat dampened our enthusiasm",288,"Ann Arbor, MI",3

With GREAT help from our WONDERFUL tour guide (KEVIN ORLOWSKI), We were able to hike long curving trails that led up, down and all over gigantic mountains and canyons! Kevin's knowledge of Zion and his fascinating stories kept us intrigued and wildly imagining as we marched under raining waterfalls, over old wooden bridges, in&out of wet dark caves and even through rapid running rivers of water!! Feeling SAFE and SECURED while being FULLY WATCHED OVER was just another perk for us and our ZANTASTIC ZION ADVENTURE!! Kevin's eyes or ears were never closed to our 10member group, which ended up being the BEST group of people EVER! Everybody stayed together, played together and we even ate together! That's right.. PICNIC on a mountain, sitting on a HUGE boulder, over looking a rolling river while the clouds smile and the birds sing. I felt so with nature, so relaxed, so worry-free but excited to see where KEVIN would take us next, excited to see how deep and cold the water really is, excited to walk inside another waterfall or through another cave. The trails are easy to follow but there's so many!! The BEST and ONLY way to go to ZION is w/ GRAND ADVENTURE TOURS and ask for KEVIN!! He's Friendly, Fun, and an Fantastic TOUR GUIDE!!!

My wife n my daughter Natasha become tired and sat down.Myself n my brother Habib took the trail towards the virgin and walked almost one hr. by the side of the river and close to the narrows.it was indeed a place that all tourist should enjoy...at one point you have to walk through the river close to narrows.We found notices saying that there is a potential hazard with flood n gush of water due to storm in close vicinity....

Zion's Main Canyon,"The main canyon is accessible during the peak season only by those taking the shuttle or who have reservations at the Lodge. The main canyon is impressive, but during the peak season, you can only stop at the various shuttle stops if you are on the shuttle and if you have reservations at the Lodge you are not supposed to stop even at the shuttle stops and you can only go as far as the Lodge itself. Many views are exceptional, but the valley is narrow and it certainly can get quite hot in the summer. Overall the Scenic Drive is far more impressive, but it is much longer and has many twists and turns. A major plus for the Scenic Drive is that often there are far longer and far more impressive vistas.","July 21, 2013","Although it doesn't compare well with the Scenic Drive, this too is a must",139,"Marana, Arizona",5

We went in July and afternoon temps reached close to 100, so plan for early morning hikes, and more leisurely activities in the afternoon. One thing that distinguishes Zion from Bryce and the North Rim, is the shuttle service through the main canyon. This gives you a great overview of the park, plus the audio recording on the shuttle gives you a good history of the park and the area. Plan your hikes carefully. From Zion, you can take a day trip to Bryce and an overnight excursion to the North Rim.","July 15, 2013",Must see,7,,5

Hikes range from very challenging to relatively easy. Saw mule deer and bighorns.  Remember, you go down into a canyon through two tunnels and then switchbacks.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion is a life altering experience. I LOVE Zion and hope to go back again in my lifetime. There is so much to do if you are adventurous. I actually wish we would've stayed an extra day here because there was so much to do - even if it would've meant skipping Bryce Canyon - it was WAY better in my humble opinion. We stayed Saturday night and checked out of the La Quinta (highly recommend staying here btw) on Monday - should've checked out Tuesday instead to have an extra day. The one thing I wish is that there would've been more pet friendly trails we could take our dogs on, but at least there was one trail they could go on and it was a nice walk that runs along the riverbed - they loved it! The parking at the park can be tricky but the shuttles also run from the park to into town. The only way to get into the park is to park at the visitor center, right turn right after the gate check-in, and get on a shuttle. You cannot drive your vehicle into the park. The shuttles run frequently and are clean. I thought we would hate riding them but it wasn't that bad. Just add it into your plan because it takes 40min to ride the shuttle to the last stop (the narrows) and 40min to get back to the visitor center because the shuttles stop at every stop along the way. The only way to avoid this is to stay at the lodge in the park (not an option for us because we were traveling with our dogs). Since we had a limited amount of time we chose to do Angel's Landing and the Narrows - this is my recommendation if you have limited time as well. These 2 hikes are so incredibly dangerous that we will NEVER forget Zion because of them.Angel's Landing:If you are physically able and can get over your fear of heights do Angel's Landing - it is fiercely challenging - you are holding onto chain that is hammered into the mountainside, one slip and you're dead - in fact a sign before you dare to dangle on the steep cliffs states that 6 people have died doing the hike since like 2004. Make sure to wear TRAIL shoes - very important to have the grip. I wore a pair of KEEN running trail shoes and they were perfect - my husband wore regular sneakers and almost died several times from his foot slipping. Also I'd recommend bringing your lunch with you - several people were eating at that top of Angel's Landing soaking up the views while our stomachs were just rumbling lol. We had brought some granola bars and were quite jealous of the sandwiches and chips others had. Another thing to bring: plenty of water and enough memory on your camera - we went to take a guys picture and his camera was full! After he'd hiked all the way up there - serious bummer. You'll want pictures to capture your accomplishment. The Narrows:This is the last stop on the shuttle and a MUST SEE! Make sure to take a walking stick (if you don't have one you may be able to get one at the beginning of the hike where people laid theirs against he wall to be used by others). I have never seen anything so incredible in my entire life. Words cannot describe how amazing this part of the park is. The highlight of my entire vacation. We did the entire day hike which took us 6 hours and tested every fiber of our being. I do NOT recommend doing the day trip unless you have lots of time and are in optimal physical health. You are walking in water - sometimes waist deep - and it is extremely difficult and sometimes even scary. You will slip on slick rocks as you are trying to cross at multiple points during the hike. I had to swim at one point because the water was so deep (I'm 5'6""), but my husband was able to walk it (he's 6'8""). That being said, it is not something we will ever forget! So if you want an incredible experience do the day hike. The day trip takes you to a spectacular pool with 3 small waterfalls. I felt like we could've gotten a similar experience hiking about an hour in and an hour out. Its basically the same stunning scenery the whole way - it changes but when I say it will test you I mean a 6-8 hour hike in water without bathrooms or anything but you and nature is something you need to be prepared for. We brought a ton of water and 6 sports bars and that was definitely NOT enough. You need to carry as much water as you can and bring plenty of food. At one point we seriously thought about giving up and just curling up - Zion narrows had beaten us - but we pushed on and made it out by 8:30pm (started at 2pm) when the sun started to go down. We were so tired we didn't even eat dinner! Our feet had been wet so long and we had gone so far that our feet were bloody and blistered and we could barely move the next day. I'm not saying that isn't awesome - we were so proud we did it and felt super accomplished - I am just letting you know that its not for the faint of heart. It is perfect for training for a Tough Mudder or a Go Ruck Challenge LOL. I also wanted to go see the Emerald Pool and see the Zion intro at the movie theater but we didn't have time to do everything. I would've done the lesser trails and seen the movies if we could've added a day to our trip. Zion was by far the BEST part of our trip (Moab/Arches, Zion, Bryce, Grand Canyon, Mesa Verde, Four Corners, Pagosa Springs, etc) - and everything else paled in comparison. In fact, I'd say the entire trip could've been Zion and it would've been perfect. I'm convinced that there is nothing more challenging or beautiful in the world. Simply amazing.","June 29, 2013",A MUST SEE!!! Most spectacular part of our trip & my life! Simply Breathtaking!,59,"Pensacola Beach, Florida",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"I agree with other contributors that this park is a must-see gorgeous place. Rather than extoll the many virtues as others have done so well, let me share some logistical takeaways after our recent 2-night stay. First, in peak months you cannot drive in the canyon. You must take a shuttle bus. They run frequently, make many stops and are crowded. Factor the travel time into your plans. I wish we'd had more time for hikes in the canyon (we did the Narrows and Canyon Overlook). We stayed east of the park and drove daily (about half an hour) to the visitor center to hunt for parking. From there, catch the bus and pass exceptional scenery; you need to hop on and off for different hikes so bring all your stuff with you in the morning. Second, many hikes have steep drop-offs that are not safe for young children or those with balance issues. I was surprised drop-offs weren't better marked. Third, great food is to be had just a couple of minutes west of the park in Springdale. We had fabulous Mexican food and margaritas at Bit & Spur (perfect meal after a hot hike) and good iced espresso at Deep Creek Coffee. If you drive to town, be prepared to wait to re-enter the park and make sure to keep your receipt from initial entrance fee. Fourth, if you have your heart set on smores, check fire restrictions (no fires were allowed when we were there). Fifth, if you camp at South Campground and have bikes, the Pa'Rus Trail skirts along the campground and along the river. The trail is easy, paved and only 3 miles RT so it's perfect for young kids--with stunning views for adults too. Loved this special place and only wish we'd had more time.","June 26, 2013",Travel Tips,69,"Seattle, Washington",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"We entered using the rte 9 gate from the Bryce area. This is a neat, twisting road heading down to the Canyon floor. As you do this you pass through a mile long tunnel. You may have to wait until its your turn through the tunnel. After the tunnel, you take a switchback road into the canyon. You have pulloffs to stop and look at the views. Once down, park at the Canyon Junction and take the park shuttles into the canyon. We took it all the way to the Temple of Sinawava stop, but you can get off and on at any of the intermediate stops to see what is there. From the end stop, you can take the paved Riverside walk further up the Virgin River. You get different vantage points as you walk.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion National Park is an easy drive from St. George, Utah. When you enter the area (if driving), signs advise to park in the town just before the Park Entrance. We parked along the side of the road and then took the Zion Park shuttle bus which comes about every 10-15 minutes. There is ample parking space at the visitor center, but the lots fill up quickly. Almost all the National Parks charge a $25 car entry fee, unless you have a Senior Pass (or other ""free"" park entry pass). The Pass is a very good deal because you can drive (or walk) into the parks free of charge. At Zion, you must take the Park shuttle bus to go up canyon, unless you are staying at the lodge. Normal tourist cars are no longer allowed up-canyon, beyond the turn-off to go to Bryce Park, unless you have a special permit for the Zion lodge area. The canyon is absolutely beautiful. The shuttle bus stops frequently at designated locations and you can get on and off easily and then take another bus (they pass frequently). The Park justifies a couple of days to allow taking some of the many hiking trails that take off from the canyon road. There are several bathroom facilities along the bus route.

Please, put this on your bucket list.","June 18, 2013",Speechless,29,"Dayton, Ohio",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"A truly unique experience in a Utah desert. Steep cliffs, narrow canyons, and unpredictable weather add to the challenge and adventure of a visit.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We recently visited Zion National Park and to say that it was breathtaking would be an understatement. The experience is made easy due to the Park Service shuttle bus system which conveniently drops you off at several locations in the park convenient for sight seeing, hikes, or a rest at the Lodge.Whether it is hiking Angels Landing, The Narrows or any of the other trails throughout the Park, this site is a natural jewel that should not be missed.","June 17, 2013",Zion National Park,3,"Annandale, NJ",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion's main canyon is the centerpiece of the national park and is particularly awesome when viewed from the top of Observation Point at 6500 ft, about 2100 ft above the canyon floor. We stayed at the Zion Lodge so that we could be close to most of the trailheads and have ready access to the shuttle buses and the food services. The Lodge is definitely worth the money. There is a large grassy area in front of the lodge that is shaded by an enormous tree. This is the spot where everyone was gathering at the end of their hikes to rest and recuperate and down some soft ice cream from the snack bar. The shuttle bus system worked great to get us to the trail heads that weren't close to the Lodge and ran so regularly that we never waited more than about 5 min to get on. The buses were sometimes quite crowded but we always got on and usually got a seat right away or after the first stop. There was a informative audio program for each leg of the shuttle route and the drivers were also informative. There were also often rangers at trail heads or points along the way to offer guidance and additional information on the various hikes that might not have been covered in the guide books. The canyon floor was hot, averaging almost 100 deg F when we were there the first week in June and it sounds as if it only gets hotter throughout the summer months. The evenings were cool and we were able to sleep with our windows open and no AC. The latter was a blessing for sure. The availability of water at various points in the canyon was excellent since we had to refill our camelbak packs every now and then and the Virgin River spring water supplied by the park was tasty. While we spent most of time hiking up into the upper reaches of the park, the canyon floor offered a nice spot to come ""home"" to. Fun place!!","June 16, 2013",one beautiful spot!!,176,"Annapolis, Maryland",5
Zion's Main Canyon,The Zion canyon was beautiful the sites went on for miles! If you head out west you should go here!

Zion's Main Canyon,We took the whole family from 3 months to 53 years. It was fantastic. The buses were well ventilated when they were moving. You had to put the stroller down every time to get on the bus. I would recommend a pack for the younger ones to minimize that problem. There were a few short hikes that everyone could go on. There is a stream at the Lodge that is refreshing to stand in to reduce your body temperature. The adults plan on going back and doing the more planned/advanced hikes. After the day at the park there is a Haiwiian Shaved Ice store that really hit the spot.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion’s main canyon was created by the Virgin River as it flows south cutting through the sandstone of the Colorado Plateau resulting in colorful sandstone cliffs soaring above, cottonwoods shading the river and many microclimates in between. Zion is one of the nation’s premier national parks and much of the best parts are in Zion’s main canyon. Assuming one is arriving in Zion from late March through early November, as the vast majority do, one will need to take the mandatory shuttle through the canyon but this is not a problem as it is free and runs as frequently as every 4 to 5 minutes in the busiest times. The stops recommended are all short, mostly flat walks that together can all be done in one day if you do not have a lot of time, or if you are just not a hiker, but will still provide a good overview of Zion Canyon. If you are a hiker, you will want to extend your visit of Zion’s main canyon to several days to hike Angels Landing, the Narrows and some of the other amazing but strenuous trails. It is important to get an early start as Zion Canyon gets very hot and the shuttle is not air conditioned. After a hearty breakfast, catch the shuttle at the visitor’s center and the first recommended stop to get out and look around is the Court of the Patriarchs which is very beautiful first thing in the morning when the sun baths the sandstone in warm light. The observation area is a very short but very steep climb but the views are also good from the road if you do not want to make the climb. Not much time is needed here so catch one of the next couple of shuttles and ride it to the Zion Lodge stop, enjoying the views and the narrative along the way. At the Zion Lodge stop get out, look around and hike the Lower Emerald Pool trail which is across the road and is an easy paved, flat trail only 0.6mi (1k) each way. The highlight of this trail is probably the water cascading lightly over the trail from the sandstone above rather than the pool itself. One returns the way they came and gets back on the shuttle headed upstream. Alternatively, one can take the excellent Kayenta Trail out which follows along a ridgeline overlooking cottonwoods and the Virgin River below returning to the scenic drive at the next shuttle stop upstream of the Zion Lodge; however, this trail is longer at 1mi (1.6k) and a little more difficult. If you are ready for lunch, take lunch now at Zion Lodge or plan to backtrack to the lodge for lunch after the nest stop. Once back on the shuttle take it to the Weeping Rock stop and take the paved, steep but short 0.2mi (0.3k) trail, each way, to the Weeping Rock where a spring seeps from the sandstone allowing a hanging garden to flourish as it clings to the sandstone canyon wall. If you have not had lunch yet, backtrack to Zion Lodge to get lunch or have a picnic lunch, if you brought one, at a picnic table in the Grotto nearby. After lunch, or Weeping Rock if you already had lunch, take the shuttle to the end of the scenic road to the Temple of Sinawava. Here the canyon is starting to narrow and the cliffs rise vertically for over 1000ft (300m). The trailhead for the best easy trail, Riverside Walk, is located here. While it has started to warm-up by now, this flat paved trail is relatively shady and along the cool waters of the Virgin River so it tends to be reasonable even on a hot day. While it is the best easy trail it is also the longest at 2.2mi (3.5k) so if you expect your time or energy to be limited, skip one of more of the earlier hikes to do this one as this is one of the more beautiful parts of the canyon. After completing the Riverside Walk, get back on the shuttle and take it all the way back to the visitor center where you can spend some time looking around, shopping and viewing the Watchman followed by a nice dinner in Springdale. After dinner, consider finishing the day by returning to the Canyon Junction shuttle stop (one can drive their own car this far but parking can be very difficult) to view the Watchman as the sun sets. The view of the Watchman, looking down the river, and photography, at this time is excellent from the bridge that crosses the Virgin River. Return the next morning(s) and hike Angels Landing or the Narrows which are strenuous but unique, rewarding experiences.","June 9, 2013",How to See One of the Premier National Park Destinations,3757,"Avon, Ohio",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Stayed at the Zion Lodge for two nights this week (June 6, 7). The lodge offered rooms and suites. We booked the lodge suite in Building A in July, 2012, room 205. When we arrived they mentioned they were booked solid through the weekend. The suite was just remodeled and was so comfortable. We never slept so well for two nights! The shuttle bus takes you to the most popular spots for photos and hiking. It was lovely, however we were not prepared for the heat!! 103 and 104 for two days.

Zion's Main Canyon,"I left Las Vegas and drove through the beautiful St. George area to get to Zion National Park. It took about three hours. Once at Zion you can park in Springdale and take a shuttle to Zion. If you get off the shuttle and walk in it is $12 . If you drive in it is $25. I'm 64 so I bought a lifetime pass at my local National Park for $10. All the National Parks are then free. I visited many on this vacation and saved $165. Once in the park there is a 9 stop shuttle. The shuttles are roomy have an audio presentation and run every 10 minutes. It is an 80 min. round trip. The easy scenic hikes are Par'us Trail, Emerald Pool (,6) miles, Riverside Walk and Weeping Rock (.5 miles). The Narrows is the main attraction. The trail starts at the last shuttle stop (The Temple of Sinawava). There are coanyon walls on alll sides. The water is 50 degrees, so a wet suit is a good idea. You can rent one at Zion Adventures. The scenery repeats it's self so you need only go as far as the junction. Flash floods are life threating. Angel's Landing (Grotto Stop) is a hard climb. Six people have died since 2004. It is steep, often you walk on the edge and there is even a metal chain to hold onto toward the end of the climb. Not for those uncomfortable with heights. The Museum has a short video on the history of the park. Springdale has mom and pop stores and a variety of places to eat. Tune in to 1610 am for park news. I took the Mt. Carmel Hwy out of the park to go to Bryce.There is a tunnel which is one way when oversized vehicles enter because of how narrow it is. Sometimes you can wait 20 minutes to get through. After 7 pm it shutsdown to oversize vehicles. The Mt. Carmel Hwy is exceptional. Lots of Turnouts and fantastic pictures. I stayed at Smith's B&B in Glendale. It is about an hour from Zion. Much more reasonable then places near Zion, great breakfast. friendly and informative.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion was the third national park we visited on our recent Utah vacation. We stayed in nearby Saint George and it was an easy drive to Zion. What I loved about the park was the free shuttle which stops at points throughout the park. No cars are allowed on the scenic road, spring through fall.Since my traveling companions wanted a relaxing day, we chose to do three walks. The trails we did were paved and easy. We started with Riverside walk at Temple of Sinawava. An easy walk along the Virgin River with lots of bird life and vegetation. Next was Weeping Rock, which had more of a climb, but not a challenge. Weeping Rock walls have ferns and other plant life growing in crevices which are fed by small water falls and sprays. Reminded me of some rain forests in Costa Rica. Lastly, we walked to the Emerald Pools. A lovely walk with lots of plant life and shaded pools of water.I would have loved to see the northern part of Zion - Kolab Canyon. But time didn't permit. Be careful when driving out of Zion! My companion got a speeding ticket, which was really a speed trap for tourists. The officer said we were doing 50 in a 35 mile zone. Maybe so, but so was everyone around us! A warning would have sufficed. We thought it was unfair to get a $100 ticket when we didn't even see a speed limit sign. The speed changes from 35 to 55 to 65 to 75 in a very short amount of time.Happy travels!","June 7, 2013",The free shuttles make visiting Zion a breeze,58,"Hendersonville, North Carolina",5

I'd definitely recommend having more than 1 day to spend here. That's all we talked about is coming back & staying in the town so we can further explore the park.

Zion's Main Canyon,"WOW! That is Zion National Park. The immense rock cliffs, truly fantastic hikes, and the sense of awe that one gets in Zion , make this place a must see. If you enter the park from the East, you are immediately treated to one of the great views of any park in the country. You enter a tunnel, come out through a small opening in a huge cliff, and there is a panorama of color and grandeur. The switch back road to the canyon floor adds to the excitement of seeing this magnificent place. There are at least 20 hikes of various intensity in the main canyon alone. For the truly adventurous, the Narrows and Angels Landing are a must. For a gentler experience but still tough are Hidden Canyon and refrigerator canyon. Weeping rock is a short walk but learning about it makes it worthwhile.Zion Canyon is a marvel and must be put on your to do list. The only warning is that the temperature reaches over 100 degrees in the summer, so take that into consideration for your hikes. Our campsite was right on the river so a quick dip into the water made it bearable on the two hottest days we were there. The Watchman campground is the better of the two but they are both good. Have fun and say ""hi"" to Angels Landing for us. We climbed it on a brutally hot day and remember the climb as one of our favorites on a three month trip around the country.","June 2, 2013",Second favorite to Yellowstone,69,Florida,5

All were easy, with great things to see everywhere we looked, including a team of climbers halfway up what looked like an impossible cliff. Pretty cool.","June 1, 2013",Beautiful,43,Portland,5
Zion's Main Canyon,Great national park with good hikes an vistas. Hiked to Angel's Landing a fairly short hike 2.5 miles although the last 1/2 mile is strenuous an will get you adrenalin going. Also hiked The Narrows which is agreat hike. I would recommend renting the water shoes as the river water temp is cold 60 degrees over Memorial Day. We did not rent them and feet were cold.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We were impressed, not only by the stunning scenery, but also by the amazing organisation at Zion. The shuttle service, set up to reduce impact on the canyon is well designed, well organised and runs like clockwork. A testament to the staff and volunteers at the park and something that some other parks would do well to try to emulate.The walks were well signposted and made access to what would otherwise have been dificult places to visit fairly easy. One criticism was that no warning of a path diversion was given at the head of the trail alongside the river, and this stopped wheelchair users dead as they could not use the sand path diversion. That apart we were impressed with everything about the park. Food in the lodge was excellent and reasonably priced, but a few more tables would be helpful. We got one but many didn't. All in all, an excellent day in the National Park.","May 31, 2013",The best organised Nation Park we have visited,55,"Rochester, United Kingdom",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"We spent two days exploring this wonderful area. We drove to the visitor centre and then had to take the free shuttle bus around the various stops. The bus ran every 10 minutes or so and became quite busy towards the end if the afternoon when people were leaving. The scenery was wonderful and we were persuaded to hike some of the easier trails. We walked along the river bank towards a 'hidden' lake and then up to 'weeping rock' which although was a short but strenuous walk up a steep path, it allowed us to experience the most wonderful cool shower under a rock overhang which was very welcome indeed.","May 30, 2013","Wonderful scenery, not to be missed.",80,England,5
Zion's Main Canyon,"We were in St. George Utah and decided on making a day trip to Zion National park. The drive was quite nice- not as mountainous as I expected. The park is on a smaller scale- so a single day's visit will be fine. You may want to stay longer- but we got in a couple of hikes and the scenic shuttle.We purchased our lifetime senior pass for just $10- since we're over 62!! (Normal entry fee is $25 a car.) So we made a point to spend some at the book store! We were there by 10 am and able to park in the main parking area.We got right on the shuttle after our shopping. We had quickly scanned the informational packet given to us at the gate and made a quick decision to stop at the lodge and walk the Emerald Pool trail. It was a tougher trail than the guide book let us believe- but we're in good shape. We looped north to the Grotto shuttle pick up and then went to the last shuttle stop- Temple of Sinawava- and walked the Riverside Walk. If you can only do one hike- this is the one!! The path was nicely paved- although they were working on it and we had a slight detour through some silty sand. If you're really up to it- and prepared, you can continue deeper into the Narrows and experience the canyon at it's finest!We had a wonderful day- as did many others!! By the time we left the parking lots were totally full and people had to park in town. This was the Wednesday after Memorial Day- so we didn't expect as many people. Take a water bottle- and fill it up with the naturally filtered waters! Wear a hat!! The sun is hot!!","May 30, 2013",Beauty in Spring,7,"Garden Grove, California",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"WOW - I waited 56 years to visit this national park. What a reward! We especially enjoyed the River Walk to the Narrows at the Temple of Sinawava Shuttle Stop. After visiting several national parks on this trip, we discovered that it works great to go later in the day after all the early morning tourists have left. You can drive right in, get parking, and don't have to struggle to find seats on the shuttle. The trails are not nearly as crowded, which is a real advantage. And finally, you are there after the high heat of the day has past, which makes it a much more enjoyable exploration.

Zion's Main Canyon,"18 years ago my wife and I traveled the great loop around the Grand Canyon. Naturally, we could see everything so we planned this week (May 6-11, 2013) with specific sites and hikes in mind. Most of the sites are well known but only with deep digging and conversing with dozens of helpful people did we have an awesome experience this past week. My wife and I are day hikers and ventured back to Zion NP to re- climb Angels Landing and hike the Emerald Lakes on one day. The views are incredible and we were even ready for the sudden rain and hail storm that hit us at the top of Scouts Landing (the rest point prior to the second set of chains up the side of Angels Landing summit. Many made it to the top but we did not. The NP shuttle describes the final ascent as ""not for the faint of heart"" and they were right. On another day, we hiked the Narrows. What great fun! The Narrows are a slot canyon with the Virgin River running through it. The water was in the 40's so we rented dry suits which included neoprene socks, well supported and rugged river shoes and a pole. There were less than 20 people who hiked it that day giving us that unique high with incredible surrounds, micro-environments, and the canyon closing in over you. Don't forget a dry bag for your camera (just in case you slip into the river like we both did)!During the last few years we became more aware of some other unique finds. The photos on google images and of course, many photographers websites have highlighted Antelope Canyon near Page, Arizona. Since we had limited time and wanted a ""sure-bet"" slot canyon experience we bypassed Buckskin Slot Canyon for the Antelope Canyon option. The Paria Canyon – Vermillion Cliffs Wilderness where Wire Pass Trail leads to the Buckskin Gulch slot canyon and the “Wave” at Coyote Butte. [You need one of 30 passes per day to enter this Bureau of Land Management property (1/2 by online lottery and 1/2 the day before in Kanab by lottery)]. On our way on Route 89 you will pass the Glen Canyon Dam at lower Lake Powell. We hope to return for the longer Buckskin experience another day but Antelope Canyon far exceeded our awe in the Navaho Tribal Lands adjacent to the massive Glen Canyon Power Plant. Entrance to the Antelope Slot Canyons was confusing! There are 5 tribal companies which provide “guides” through these “must-see” hikes from Page. It is much easier to travel directly from Route 89 to Route 98 (toward the power plant and Kaibito) and enter the Upper Antelope Canyon (UAE) parking lot to the right of the road and the Lower Antelope Canyon (LAE) parking lot to the left of the road. You will pay a fee ($6.00) to park on Navajo Tribal land but the two canyons exist on different family properties and they each charge differently to be guided through the slots. Each hike is less than a mile and there is not enough memory on your camera to capture the incredible kaleidoscopic colors, shadows and light images of these natural wonders. Each took about an hour of time and the tours leave approximately each 30-60 minutes. A very short worthwhile side trip is a short hike to the edge of the Grand Canyons Horse Shoe Bend. This is a gorgeous 270 hairpin in the Colorado River just a few miles south of Page. Just past the trailhead, Route 89 caved in and is detoured through Route 98 and Kaibito to Flagstaff which was our next stop.We picked up our Wildlands Trekking Tour to Havasu Falls in Flagstaff. Our guide was a incredibly affable, multi-cultural young woman who has lived and guided in the French Alps, Iceland and the American Southwest. She has also traveled the world and provide us the tents, packs, gourmet meals over a 28 mile hike through the Havasu Tribe Canyon land (from the Hualapai Hilltop, yes, another tribal land to Supai village and campgrounds). Area hikers seem to know how to get there but finding enough information was difficult and Wildlands made it simple as well as a superior trip. After 1.5 miles down a somewhat steep but flat switchback, we entered the canyon wash and hiked to Supai, the Havasu Indian Village for 6.5 miles. For those not so inclined, there is helicopter service 4 days a week to jump this 8 mile portion of gorgeous stratified geographical rock strata. In town, you register and pay for the use of the campground and hike the remaining 2 miles passing 3 of the turquoise, blue and green waterfalls, pools and cascades. 5 water features contrast against the red rocks and boulders of the lower Supai rock strata and the white fallen rock and sand of the Coconino layers highest in the Canyonlands; these are Upper Navajo Falls, Lower Navajo Falls and Havasu Falls above the campground and by chain and ladder to Moony Falls just below the campgrounds. A less used trail and one that is easily missed by many a hike (thank you Myriam for guiding us in the right direction) is the lesser seen and incredible calcified travertine pools of Beaver falls 4 miles more distant down Havasu Creek. Each changing micro-environment provides lots of great natural wonders from desert cactus blooms, lizards, and birds to oasis like gardens and grasses. If you choose, we didn’t) you can leave Havasu country down canyon and head to the confluence of the Colorado River and Havasu Creeks. It will take you another 4 miles to get there.The next morning we awoke at 4 AM to break camp and get hiking back to the ‘hilltop” before it got too hot. We made the 10 miles back in a very reasonable 4.5 hours.The 3 hour ride back to Flagstaff was punctuated by the cartoon like town of Seligman. If your remember the day when Route 66 was the lone highway from Chicago to LA, Seligman is the remaining nostalgic town with a western flair, Elvis and Marilyn Monroe mannequins and 1960’s cars and trucks. You could picture yourself among “Lightning McQueen” the race car and “Mater” the lowly tow truck. It was a fun stop on the cracked asphalt and dry desert with red rock canyons of Route 66.It was graduation night when we returned to Flagstaff. Outdoor music and circus festivities took over downtown. We tried to get into the “Cottage” one of the towns highlighted restaurants but missed out for “Pasto’s” delicious blend of eggplant and portabella fries with balsamic glaze, fresh and crisp arugula salad and unique eggplant ravioli parmesan.It was a 7 day well paced Canyon land hiking trip!

Zion's Main Canyon,"This is one of the must do that should be add to your list. Took my parents to see both Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon and to them it was the best experience they ever had. They have enjoyed the free shuttle ride that is provided by the park with a narrative tour. We also did a couple of the easy hikes with amazing views of the park. Recommend the Riverside Walk trail at the Temple of Sinawava if that is the only hike u have time for. The trail follows the Virgin River up to the Narrows, which is for the more experienced hikers. It is also within canyon walls so recommend taking a light jacket just in case since it does get cooler here than any other areas around the park.Note...if u are a senior or taking someone who is a senior, recommend getting the senior interagency pass. This pass is $10 compared to the normal $25 entrance fee per ""vehicle"". It can be used for 7 consecutive days and can also be used for Bryce Canyon within the 7dys.

Zion's Main Canyon,"I am not saying perfect just because of a little rain/hail but it really was perfect for us.Having been to the Grand Canyon and Lake Powell a couple times in previous trips, and Bryce earlier on this trip I can fairly say that Zion ranks a lot higher (to us) than those places.We drove down from Bryce and it took a couple hours, we entered Zion via the east entrance.(as planned).Right away the views are totally amazing and incredible Went to visitors center and got onto a shuttle up into Zion canyon….the canyon is not accessible by car, but this works out fine, the shuttles run up and down the canyon and you get off and on as much as you want. Each stop has restrooms and some have small restaurants. Also each have trails ranging from easy to hard. the shuttles also have a clearly heard narration on the way outbound, describes canyon stops, historical stuff and also they run about every 10 minutes which is awesome.We toke the shuttle up to the last stop and got out and walked a couple trails, very serene and lots of people there but not overcrowded. I can see we could have used a couple extra days here. Next day we checked out of our hotel (Majestic Village) and took the shuttle up to big bend stop, high peaks plus saw hikers on the top of angels landing, really high up and we had our binoculars to see the the hikers, Next time I would like to hike this trail at least up to Scout's Lookout. We then took the shuttle to Weeping Rock and took a short but steep hike, however halfway through it started to rain and hail so we turned back, we probably will hike more if we come again, being up high like that is an entirely different perspective.Then we took the shuttle to the museum stop to look through the exhibits.

We ended up say at Zion for 4 days and went into the park each day with the intent to see what we had not the day before.We made some great hikes and in spite of the rain we had a fantastic time. We loved the ease of the shuttle program. It is so convienent and timly you cannot go wrong. More Parks could use this service to monito traffic & parking issues.The beauty that is within the wall of Zion are much like an artist palate. The colors change depending on the location of the sun and clouds. The views are spactacular. This is a world reknown destination. We heard people chatting from all over the word. The google tracker was there photographing trails and streams while we were there. We saw them working. Very interesting. Many different species of flowers and plants, trees and cactus. Loads of birds and butterflies. Just a special place to visit.We didn't make it to Bryce this time but we will another time. It was well worth the 4 days at Zion. The entery fee was good for a week. There are different fees depending on age and visitation.","May 23, 2013","Natural beauty, a must visit location!",288,"Bozeman, Montana",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"This, you need to see! It is unbelievable. The views in this park from the time you enter till the time you leave are astounding!

Zion's Main Canyon,"My friend and I did the Subway in mid-May 2013. Pre-hike: First, we showed up at the parking lot of Kolob Terrace Road at about 4:30 am. No we weren't over eager, we were setting up to get shots of the Milky Way. The night was clear and the shots (which were my first attempt) were great! After taking shots for about an hour, we decided to get a move on to the trail. We knew it would be difficult and likely not advisable to do the scrambling in twilight/darkness, but we wanted to at least get to the drop-off and then wait for sunset.We ended up accidentally taking a wrong turn and ended up overlooking a scary cliff that seemed to drop off into the dark, windy abyss! I wasn't sure if that was the right place to drop off but right at that moment I made up my mind to forget about the hike if it was! Luckily, we backtracked, and ended up getting back on the main path and made it to the drop off. If you're getting an early start, there is a good chance you may have trouble staying on the main path, so just pay extra attention. The scramble down was a little bit more difficult than I expected. Nothing to physically challenging, but slightly more treacherous than I had envisioned. Still, just pay attention to where you are stepping and you will be just fine. When we got down we changed into our rented canyoneering shoes. We rented them so we'd be able to walk through the stream, cascades, and Subway without risking a fall with our expensive camera equipment. Let me tell you that renting them was an AWESOME idea. Once, we decided that we didn't care about getting wet, we were stepping all over slippery rocks with no worries about slipping. Once, we got to the cascades, we were jumping up and all around with ease! If you want to get around easily and not worry about getting shoes and socks wet, rent these from the local Zion Adventure company in Springdale. BUT BEWARE!!!Make sure you get a size or half-size too big. They will get you to try on a pair once you are there. Try on a pair that fits perfectly, then get a size or half-size larger. I went with a pair that had the ""perfect fit"" and once my neoprene socks expanded, the torture began! The shoes became too small!!! I decided to ""tough"" it out the whole way and the pain was horrible. It turned two of my toenails black, cut and bruised my knuckles on my other toes, and resulted in like six or seven blisters. My friend (who got a size bigger) only had like one blister. Back to the hike... Do your best to stay on the bank of the stream. Like I said, once you commit to crossing/wading/getting wet, it is so much easier to make good time. Contrary to other reviews, the trail is marked well! Yes, there is still a decent amount of route finding, but I think there were only two times where we went one way and then realized we had to go back. Don't be afraid to travel in the stream! It's refreshing and a lot of times faster!So we arrived at the subway at like 9:30 am. I think it took about 3 1/2 hours (with our mishap starting off). This was great because I got to take in the Subway and get photos without anyone else around. However, the Subway was cold!!! The sun was not yet reaching the canyon and the light inside the Subway was a little less than ideal. We decided we didn't want to wait until peak time for the light so we just got our photos then left. And that's partially why I'm giving four stars. The Subway itself, while extremely interesting, was not as stunning as I'd hoped for. I immediately realized that doing the top-down would have been 10X more exciting than bottom-up. Don't get me wrong, seeing the Subway is still worth it, regardless of which way you go. It's just, I reallllly wanted to do the top-down once I got there. The way back was easy. We went at a decent pace and easily crossed over the rocks and stream, as we didn't care at all about getting wet at that point. A snake did jump on the trail at one point and scared the ever living out of me but it was fine. There was a moment when we were coming back and thought we may have passed the trail heading back up. But that was because the canyon wall blocks your view of the charred rock until you are right near it. There were some pink ribbons in the trees by the trail to help you find your way out, too. I recommend timing your hike so that you know about when to start looking for the ribbons and this other ""foot sign"" that help you know where it's at. And finally, the climb back up! Be prepared, I'm in shape, and the climb back up was not easy. It had a lot to do with the fact that my feet/toes were KILLING ME from those damn canyoneering shoes, but it would not have been easy regardless. But just take in some water right before you begin the ascent and take a couple of short breathers under the trees on the way up, and you will be back up before you know it. Just be prepared, because the walk to the parking lot from the the top of the canyon is likely longer than you remember! So what are my take-a-ways?- If you get an early start like we did, be prepared to stick around for an hour and a half for the sun to come into peak position.- We brought like 10 bottles of water and were fine. Though it was very cool the whole way there. If we had set out later, I think we would have drank all ten bottles of water. - I almost forgot, the cascades are truly a sight to take in!!! They were bigger and more beautiful than I had imagined!- Tons of frogs and lizards running around and flopping everywhere. Watch out for snakes!- Rent your canyoneering shoes bigger than you think you need! You don't HAVE to have them, but they help a lot, especially if you are worried about slipping with your camera gear.That's about it... hope you enjoy it! Hopefully, I'll get back and do the top-down and give this hike the five stars I know it deserves!","May 22, 2013","Zion Bottom up - Great hike, but will do top to bottom next time",5,"Berkeley, California, United States",4

Zion's Main Canyon,"I went in May 2013, perfect weather (24-26°C) sunny and dots of clouds. I was hoping to have a nice combination of hikes and views, without too many kms to drive. I really liked Zion. I only had one day, which was perfect to do approx 14 kms of hiking in total. I arrived close to 10 am and got parked at the visitor center. Jumped onto the shuttle bus (thank you driver Linda). I was afraid that they would not drive on a high frequence, but they did, never had to wait for more than 3 minutes to catch one. My first stop: court of patriarchs. I got out to take some pictures and descend to the river. My second stop: Zion Lodge. I did the lower, middle and upper emerald pools and connected to kayenta trail to arrive at Grotto. As it was a beautiful day on a Sunday, the track was quite busy, but not too busy that it disturbed me. A lot of senior people doing the hikes (wow, I wish I could do that when I'm older...), but also quite some women hiking alone (thank God, so I was not the only one). It took me 2 hours to complete. By this time the battery of my camera died, but at the reception they were so friendly to plug my camera in, while I was shopping...Next I did the Riverside walk, nice. And it started to rain! quite rare phenomenon here... It stopped after a few minutes... The flowers and plants clinged onto the vertical mountain walls, sucking up the water that came dripping down. At several points access to the river, nice to cool off your feet after a walk.Weeping rock was surprising, and a very short hike...And finally I did the Pa'rus trail. What a nice walk, not strenious at all, all paved. I didn't see many people on this trail. I did the trail from Canyon Junction to the Visitor Center. But actually I think it is better the other way around, as close to Canyon Junction, right before the bridge, you can descent to the river and it has a nice sandy beach with stones to sit on... To top of the day, I drove the Camel Highway east. Right after the tunnel, put my car on the right (small) parking lot (don't drive by, you can turn, but need to go back through the tunnel and back if you miss it - another small parking lot is available 100 meters further to the left). I did the Canyon Overlook Trail. Nice... It has some steep cliffs, I wouldn't recommend for families with children, although I saw some passing by. The view back on the canyon and the highway you came from are breathtaking.If I would have had another day I would have done a longer moderate hike. For the more sporty people, the Narrows and Angel's landing trails are probably unfrogettable...","May 20, 2013",Great escape,29,"Wellen, Belgium",5

Suggest you do a bit of the hike at the start of the narrows at the end if the team road. Take a long gander at the Big Bend. Take the short but slightly steep hike to Weeping Rock.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We drove from our B&B in Glendale going west on Hwy 9 to the Visitor's Center, so we got to enjoy the fabulous diversity of rocks and foliage around every bend in the winding road and the 1 mile tunnel. Do listen to the AM radio info when you see the signs to get info on vehicle size restrictions and other important news.At 9 am on a Monday, the parking lots were almost full and we didn't want to have to go farther West into town to find street parking and ride another shuttle.We watched the movie in the Visitor center and got a park newspaper with good details (not found in the brochure you get upon entry) of the hikes and sights to see. This canyon is viewed from the bottom up and the shuttle takes you the Temple of Sinewave to access the Riverwalk Trail. We walked along the Virgin River past a variety of high, narrow canyon walls and hanging gardens for about a mile. The shuttle driver's narration of the fierceness of the docile-looking river made the journey more interesting as we tried to imagine it flooded. We didn't continue past the end of the pavement as that involves wading/swimming in the river. We did utilize the shuttle several times along its route for short hikes to the various attractions along the way and never waited more than 10 minutes to re-board.Our time was limited, so we got back into the car around 2 pm and headed for two hikes suggested by friends. The first, is and easy walk to some Petroglyphs and a pool near the only pull-out with a wood fence. Ask a ranger for details as I can't explain how to find it. And the next was the Canyon Overlook (parking almost at the east the tunnel entrance) for a breathtaking view (and hike) looking over the switchbacks in the valley. Do wear hiking boots with traction for this one.Again, one day was not enough and I plan to return with my RV, but the temperatures are much warmer (upper 80's early May) than Bryce (which was below freezing a few nights prior), so timing them both for May or Sept may be tricky.

Zion's Main Canyon,"I have had a desire to visit Zion National Park now for several years, but have not had the opportunity until this past Spring Break. I loved every minute of my trip. This was a family trip, with my wife and three children ages 5, 7 and 8. As a family we were able to complete 6 of the hikes and I did an additional 3 hikes on my own. If you are intending to go on family hikes, I would recommend Emerald Pools, the trail leading from Emerald Pools to Angels Landing, Weeping Rock, Canyon Overlook, and Riverside Walk. These are relatively short hikes, about 1 mile each way, or less. You still need to monitor your children and keep them away from the edge of some steep cliffs, but overall they are family friendly.My favorite hike was Angels Landing. It's about a 1500 foot ascent to the top of a spectacular 360 degree view of Zion. The last 1/2 mile is pretty steep and is not recommended for inexperienced hikers or people afraid of heights, as there are extremely steep cliffs on either side of the trail which can get pretty narrow in certain spots. It is best to go early in the morning or later in the afternoon as it can get pretty busy late morning into the early afternoon. This hike alone was worth the entire trip.A word of advice, which nobody tells you: If you are planning to visit the 5 national parks in Utah, or even 3 of the 5, purchase the National Park year pass. The price for each national park entrance is $25, the year pass is only $80 and you can use it at ALL National Park entrances in the USA. I did not find this out until I got to the park entrance of Bryce and they charged me another $25. What they failed to mention to me as well, is that I could have applied my entrance fee from Zion at Bryce to purchase the year pass. I did not find this out until later when I got home to California and researched it on the National Park Website. This was the only negative part of the trip, other than that, I loved every minute of my trip to Zion.","May 8, 2013",Amazing Hikes and Spectacular Views,117,"Whittier, CA",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion is a beautiful place: it is grand and yet small enough that it does not overwhelm the senses. It's beauty is deep and sometimes subtle, and offers you chances to see impressive peaks but also experience small wonders. There are hikes both rugged and easy, and the valley is lush and supports a lot of interesting plants and flowers. The shuttle through the park runs well into the night, so make sure you experience the dark side. Moonrise over these hills is a moving experience, and the sounds of the river, the trees and the wildlife gives you a sense of closeness to the world. Stay a few days and explore.

We hopped on the free shuttle tour, which runs every 7 minutes or so, and makes stops along the way for hiking and photo opportunities. The narrative is very good, and we learned a lot about the area that we would not have known if we had taken our own car on the drive.

However, if the lodge is full, do not hesitate to stay in Springdale. The shuttle runs into town, so it is quite convenient. (Actually, it has the advantage of having more restaurants.)

You will be in awe of the colors, formations and the natural beauty of the whole area. The Virgin river was running fast last week due to recent snow storms and the nighttime temps were in the high 20's. I have seen it in the dead of winter, the early spring and in the heat of summer. Anytime is a great time to go. The hiking can be easy, moderate or difficult so be prepared with the right equipment and the right mindset. People have died here, usually by taking risky chances while climbing. There are several campgrounds and a lodge. The local town, very touristy and expensive, has restaurants and several hotels. A National park pass is only $80.00, good for one year and is good for any national park. Otherwise, the admission per car with 4 people is $25.00. The park shuttles are free and will take you to a 8 different hop on/hop off points.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Canyon filled with jaw-dropping beauty, especially at sunrise and sundown when the light brings the canyon walls to life. Free shuttle takes you to many easy hikes throughout the park. For a greater challenge try two hikes: Angel's Landing and The Narrows.The scenic route is closed to cars April-October, a GREAT idea to cut down on traffic and pollution. The shuttle bus runs every few minutes and even provides narration. Another great way to see park is via bike - rent at park entrance or several places in Springdale, the town bordering the park.","April 13, 2013",Breathtaking,97,Maryland,5

Zion's Main Canyon,"I didn't realize that you had to first go through an entry point at Zion National Park to get to Bryce Canyon. However, I was not disappointed as we passed through the quaint town of Springdale (we did stop for a look at a pottery shop). This scenic climb through sandy-colored mountains is one I'll not forget. We used our National Park Pass which came in handy to see all the parks we did. The winding road offers beautiful scenery. Do take a passenger with a camera as the driver doesn't fully enjoy the sights while behind the wheel. A wonderful little bonus this was.","April 9, 2013",Unexpected Surprise,113,"Fountain, Colorado",5

If you weren't planning to hike you could sit and relax taking in the beautiful sites on the shuttle for the full loop around which is about 1 1/2 hrs. They have several drop off and pick up stations. One stop is at the Lodge area where you could sit and relax, have a bite to eat, or browse the souviner shop.There is a wide range of hiking opportunities at all experience levels.

Zion's Main Canyon,This is a fabulous place to visit in spring or fall. I think summer would be extremely hot. The scenery is beautiful and this is a lovely canyon. Hiking trails are excellent and well maintained. The emerald pool trails are steeper than I expected and way too many people but worth a trip especially if you get out early. There were very few people on the watchman trail which I think was my favorite. The shuttle system is terrific- very reliable and the drive through Highway 9 to Bryce Canyon is gorgeous.,"April 8, 2013",Stunning scenery,28,"Denver, Colorado",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion National Park is 1 hr east of St. George, UT on Hwy 9. It is also about 2 1/2 hrs north of the North Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park and also 2 1/2 hrs north of Lake Powell. The road from Hurricane takes you through LaVerkin and Springdale. Springdale is a little more upscale than Hurricane and LaVerkin and has a number of B & Bs and cafes along the road. Hurricane on the other hand has less expensive gas and some grocery stores (load the cooler before heading to Zion; although Zion has some smaller shops, what they offer is limited; also you are in UT, which means that no wine is sold in the grocery stores ... in fact no wine or beer above 3.5% is sold except in state (monopoly) stores. The closest state store is in St. George!!If you go to Zion, you can camp there; the camp ground is on the southern end of the park, where the entrance is located. The Zion lodge is on the northern end. A pass to enter Zion's will cost about $25 (a car), motorcyclists and cyclists will each pay about $13 per person. If you are planning to visit multiple national parks buy the Annual Pass for $80 (a yr from the date of purchase).As for cycling, while one can cycle in the park (best thing to do is to load the bikes and park by the entrance), the paths are limited. If you cycle and are not in the cyclist/walker path and bus approaches you must stop to let the bus go-bye unless you are TdF material and can time trial at a speed above 25 mph.It is best to arrive early too since parking is limited and the park makes a concerted effort to get people to ride the bus.There are number of great hikes. The bus stops coincide with these stops. While in Zion's I hiked the Lower Emerald Pool Trail (considered Easy) and the Upper Emerald Pool Trial and the Kayenta Trail. These latter two hikes connect and are considered Moderate hikes. The emerald trails are popular and the water pools are well .... not emerald. I would skip the Upper Emerald Trail if there is a crowd since the path is narrow and there are a few step areas that require one climb some; going doen one has to be a little careful. The Lower Emerald and Kayenta Trails connect. The Kayenta Trail affords one a beautiful view of the valley and the ""grotto."" The Virgi River is to ones' immediate right along this trail. At the end of the walk (about 3 to 3 1/2 miles) if one leaves from The Zion Lodge stop one can catch the bus back or walk the bank of the river back to the Zion Lodge and enjoy their outdoor cafe (great vistas) or the lodge .... which is rustic and peaceful.The better known trails require that one carry water and some snacks to replenish. The Angels Landing trail leaves from the Grotto. This is hard climb with some drop-offs (there are chains one can cling on to avoid falling to ones death ... which happens!!). That will take 5 hrs. But if you get there (to the top) you might just see a California Condor ... and you will get some great views!There are some trails that require permits (an extra fee) and will be a major workout. The two popular ones are Kolob Arch via La Verkin Creek trail (8 hrs) and The Narrows via Riverside Walk (which requires that you wade through water and is a no-no when there is precipitation and danger of flash floods). There are some tour companies that will take you through the narrows and also canyoneering. You will get wet!! and go through some amazing tight spots. They will equip you. This is not for the faint of heart!!There is also a corral. They offer mule rides (day and more) that leave from across the Zion's Lodge. This is fun for the kids and adults. The longer rides involve overnights and are in remore areas of the park.In short Zion's is a geological wonder! a must see for US and foreign guests! Bring binoculars, your back pack, water and a camera ... you will not regret this visit.","April 4, 2013",Zion National Park - a must see,17,"Chelan, Washington",5

It got busy later in the day with people having to stand in the isles. I imagine the high season being incredibly crowded. Visiting in the shoulder season would be your best bet.Loved the beautiful little town of Springdale, Utah right outside the park.We stayed at the Cliffrose Lodge and loved it.

We did emerald pool trail, which was quite easy. We also did the more challenging hidden canyon. The last part of that hike only dad and the 13 year old did. A bit iffy, frankly. Don't bother with lunch at the lodge. There is a sitting down restaurant that we did not try. But the cafeteria had only a very bad selection of semi-edible junk food. Make sure to bring your own food, or go back to Springdale. Indeed, I am happy we stayed in Springdale, a few minutes outside the park.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We went to Zion National Park during the winter months as they allow you to drive your own vehicle on the Scenic Drive this time of year. The rock formations look like art sculptures on a giant scale, with valleys of trees, scrubs, and ice that make the view even more spectacular. Everywhere you look you see something you want to capture in a photograph knowing it will not be the same as being in Zion. The cool clean air invigorates you this time of year to do some hiking on trails that you might not feel like doing in warmer weather. Zion is gorgeous, peaceful, and breathtaking. This should be on your top ten of National Parks to visit...there is good food in the Zion Lodge, and the people are very super friendly. The food is sustainable to the environment...I definitely recommend Zion for all.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We just got back from Zion National Park, it was just beautiful! We were able to drive through since it was January. I believe from Nov - Mar you can drive your car otherwise you are shuttled. This was our first time to Zion and hopefully it won't be our last. The rock formations are just beautiful, lots of red, orange and white rock with the sun shining on them it is an awesome experience. We drove from Las Vegas, about a 2 1/2 hour journey, stayed in Springdale for a night. Very few tourists at this time of the year so it was nice. I am sure it would be even better later in spring before the crowds come it would be warmer and you could hike some of the trails. The welcome center was very nice, everyone was very friendly and helpful. Looking forward to our next visit. Flying into Vegas is a great location to see many of Gods wonders just a few hours away. There is a 25.00 fee to get in the park per vehicle but if you are 62 and over you can purchase a LIFETIME senior pass for $10.00 and it is good in all the National Parks. A vey good bargain for what you get! Also, as long as one person has it the entire vehicle gets in. We purchased one pass since we always travel together. You can drive through the park in less than an hour or take your time and stop and admire the scenery or hike some trails it's a wonderful place to visit.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion National Park exceeded my wildest expectations. Everyone talks about the Grand Canyon and it is indeed majestic and awe inspiring but I must say Zion National Park is even better. Unlike the Grand Canyon where you are looking over and across the canyons, in Zion National Park you are at the bottom of the canyons looking up. The hiking, with the exception of The Narrows, is more uphill, unlike the Grand Canyon. Perhaps that is the reason the views are so striking. Their is a wonderful lodge nestled in the park which books up quickly but is a wonderful starting point for your visit. The restaurant and little shop are great and the rooms are well maintained, if a bit dated. You can dine outside on the rooftop when the weather cooperates so don't miss this opportunity.This park should be a must on anyone's life list of National Parks.","January 24, 2013",The best park in the nation,72,"Naperville, Illinois",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"We visited Zion National Park in mid January and it is without doubt one of the most awe inspiring places on earth. The scenic panorama surrounds you with the majestic canyon offering amazing scenes to take in and photograph as you turn every corner on the canyon floor. In fact it is one of those places where you sense that any photo that you do take simply won't do it justice, but take them anyway, particularly as the light and colours of the canyon are forever changing as the sun moves across the canyon and the beauty of this place intensifies even more. This is one place that I am definitely going to return to and it is definitely the perfect place to inspire you and refresh your soul. We want to one day do the 'Narrows' walk as just looking at the start to it makes you want to explore it. Also take the time to call in at the National Park Visitors Center as soon as you arrive as this will give you an ideal orientation to what you are about to behold.","January 23, 2013",What an awesome place!,8,Heddon Greta,5

Zion's Main Canyon,"We visited Zion's main canyon by using the very easy to use and understand shuttle system. This is the only way to see most of the park unless you have a special park pass, which allows you to drive into the park on a few restricted access roads. We parked at the main Visitor's Center and tried to get there a little before 9am and the parking was a bit hard to find even by then.We had the America The Beautiful Pass (wonderful thing to have if you're visiting more than 3 parks on your trip) Plan to get to the main entrance before then as you will find a closer spot. Sometimes the parking lots fill by 9:30. We only had to wait 5 mins to push off in one of the shuttles and decided to take the ride all the way to the last stop on the shuttle, Temple of Sinawava, and then decide our stops on the way back after doing the short Riverside Walk (~ 1.5 miles total).It took about 45 mins to get to the Temple stop but throughout the whole ride, our shuttle driver was telling us stories and noting important landmarks on the way, adding in some humor here and there. The Temple stop was a beautiful first stop for us and the hike was easy and paved. We saw two California Condors from the canyon floor which we watched soaring around for about 5 minutes. We felt very lucky to have seen these almost extinct birds! We then decided to take the Weeping Rock stop and hiked about 1/4 mile up to Weeping Rock (it is a steep incline during most of it). The view from Weeping Rock was beautiful and by this time it was a bit warm so the water droplets were most welcome. After this we stopped at Zion Lodge and got a bit to eat at around 2:30 (it can get pretty busy there). Seating is outside mostly and it was a beautiful day. We took the lower Emerald Pool Trail (about 3/4 of a mile maybe?) and decided against taking the more strenuous Upper Emerald Pool trail because, frankly, we were just tired. The shuttle system was wonderful and made sure that you didn't have to worry about parking, congestion and headache in the park. Next time we visit, we would like to do the upper trails and see the canyon from above, but because of our time constraints (one night and a full day in the park), we weren't able to do as much as we'd like. Take your time if you can and definitely do more than one day in the park if your trip allows.","January 20, 2013",Beauty that's easy to see!,81,"Knightdale, North Carolina",5

But once we entered from the east entrance and went through the tunnel..... wow, fantastic views and the drive down to the canyon was breathtaking. The entrance was grand and you feel really tiny among the cliff walls around you. We visited on Thanksgiving day, so the park was a little crowded, all the view point had full carparks, but with a little patience, we still managed to complete the scenic drive and take a few small hikes with our kids. The grounds at Zion Lodge was really nice, we managed to take a short 'nap' lying under the huge tree in the middle of the park.","January 15, 2013",Zion National Park - one of a kind,66,"Beaumont, Texas",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"My wife and I have been coming to Zion since 2004. We've done all of the canyon and most of the back country hikes and never get tired of the views and hikes. We are day hikers so we can't comment on camping in Zion but so far we haven't found a bad day hike. Hikes can range from easy walks(Par'us TRAIL 1.5 mi. paved and flat with great views) to very strenuous hikes (West Rim Lava Point to the Grottoo 17 mi), so there is something for all skill levels. If you are a seriuos hiker there are many canyoneering and climbing options. .in addition to the main canyon it is worth a trip up to Lava Point (and hiking down the west rim to the canyon is spectacular), a trip to the Kolob section (where a hike to Kolob arch is well worth the effort and continuing on the Bear Trap falls is sublime ) and a drive through the tunnel to the east side of the park (consider a hike to Deertrap mountain or Cable mountain for spectacular views) . We'd suggest staying in Springdale or on the west side of the canyon as it's closer to the buses and main canyon. If you stay of the east side expect it to take about 30 minutes to get from the park entrance to the visitors center.While you are hiking be sure and carry lots of water (about 2 x what you think you'll need), most first time visitors don't and end up slightly dehydrated. Expect temp's in the 100 degrees June through August and 80's to 90's May and June, Aprilmay , Sept. and Oct. are comfortable. The winter (November through March are less crowded but you may lose the upper hikes due to snow (unless you like to hike in the snow).A visit to Zion is something that should be on everyones bucket list.","December 29, 2012","Worth a trip from anywhere, great views great hiking",258,"Hurricane, Utah",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"While returning from a trip to Bryce Canyon my wife and I decided to extend our trip with a stop at Zion National Park. We are so glad that we did. As it was off season we were able to drive the scenic road up the canyon. In season this I s served with a trolley ride. Unlike Bryce where great views were from the rim, in Zion you drove the base of the canyon and were constantly looking up. The Visitor's Center was closed for renovations, but all the services were provided in the Museum. While it was a short trip, 4 hrs, we did manage to get a short hike in and we were not disappointed. Another day of spectacular scenery.","November 30, 2012",Every Turn a Stunning View,6,"Watertown, CT",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion is somewhat unique among the SW Natiional Parks as you explore it from the base as opposed to the rim. The drive into the canyon is impressive as you go through windowed galleries and emerge on the canyon floor. The main trail follows the Virgin River and is easliy accessible. Suggest packing a picnic lunch - there are a lot of large flat rocks along the river for a resting stop. Be sure to see the Grotto and Weeping Rock attractions (Weeping Rock has a pretty steep incline). There is a shuttle bus service which runs every 10 min so if you get tired, just hop on. We spent the night in the cabins near the main lodge which provided excellent accomodations. Saw some wild turkeys and deer next to our cabin in the morning.","November 22, 2012",Zion National Park - Caravan Tour,30,"Landenberg, Pennsylvania",5

No doubt it is beautiful at any time but, November through March allows personal transportation on all of Zion’s roads and you can quickly enjoy the diversity of the park… although I’m sure it is always worth the wait.","November 18, 2012",New favorite place on Earth: Zion National Park,8,"Jurupa Valley, California",5
Zion's Main Canyon,It's almost ALL UP HILL.....but then most hikes are either up or down. We started early. We took the first bus out to be ahead of the crowds and be in shade for the hike. There was still traffic on the trail. A big Mulie Buck and 2 Doe. Late October is rut for deer so they can be a tad protective and could charge. The trail is paved most of the way but is narrow. The views are spectacular and worth the hike. If you are out of shape just take it easy and be sure to carry water and a camera. You'll need it. The colors are just unbelievable. Again early in the day the sun won't bother you. Go as fair as you feel comfortable......it's the journey not the destination.On your trip back down go to your right and stop at the Grotto (Hanging Gardens).

Zion's Main Canyon,"I can’t say that I have ever been to a National Park that I have not been impressed with, and Zion is no exception. The reds are spectacular and the shuttle bus is informative and makes getting around the park a breeze! There are a few good hikes that are short and sweet (just what we were looking for after hiking 60 miles the previous week). The River Walk, along the Virgin River was beautiful and kind to sore muscles. Of course, since it was so pleasant, it was also very crowded, so take it as an easy stroll and you will find it to be much more pleasant. The Watchman hike is much less crowded and provides an interesting view of the canyon walls, wildlife and flora. Well worth the effort on the trail, even though the view at the turn-a-round isn’t much (as far as other areas of the park are considered). The only other trail we partook in was the Emerald Pools. Short hike, but I was not impressed. I’m sure it is a much more spectacular site in the spring and early summer, but by early October, the water flow was a trickle and a little sad. Everyone hiking in water boots through the Narrows wanted me to start planning our next adventure at Zion! That seems like it is the hike to take. The other “must” hike at the park is Angles’ Landing. If you looked up at the summit, with binoculars, from The Bend, you can see tons of people making their way along the chain of the last leg! Seems like a most popular hike!","November 7, 2012",Gorgeous,48,"Pomeroy, Ohio",4

The aspens were a bright white which contrasted nicely with the maple trees turning yellow, red and brown.

Absolutely beautiful and the hike to the Grotto was not that difficult. Crossed a stream several times and the sound of the water was very soothing. Very glad we did this trip, which also included 3 days in Bryce which is only 2 hrs north and even more stunning, in October.

We did not have rented equipment and were just fine in good sneakers, shorts, backpack with water and the all important walking stick. You cannot do this hike without a walking stick. It was October and the water temp was 55 degrees which was actually fine. The weather has to be clear so there is no danger of flash floods. It takes about 3 hours to walk in the river to the slot canyons and 6 hours to complete the trip. I have amazing photos which will be with me forever and anyone who can take their time and negotiate the rocks and water knee deep can make this trip.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We traveled to Zion having visited Bryce first. My first reaction was that Bryce is more unique, because we have seen landscape and scenery like that in Zion in other western places. (Bryce also seemed less busy.) However, the hikes at Zion were more varied and interesting. We tried to stay at the lodge in the park, but could not get reservations so we stayed at the Best Western Zion Park Inn in Springdale. (Springdale is a nice tourist town with many restaurant options and shops.) We were glad we did. It was very convenient and the lodge in the park was VERY busy, I remarked that it was like a city there, not what we had in mind. In fact Zion itself was quite busy, even though we chose this time of year to avoid summer crowds. (We had hiked in Joshua Tree National Park a couple years ago and that park feels much more remote. I guess we thought we would have that experience at Zion.) That being said, the hiking and scenery were fabulous and we saw fewer people on some of the more challenging hikes. We entered the park via the tunnel, and if you hike, don't miss the trail right before you enter the tunnel. We also liked the hike along the river. Plan to spend a few days at Zion. We were there for three days. You may not use your car in the main part of the park but the shuttle system is extremely easy and convenient to use. It will pick you up in Springdale, but we were able to park at the Visitors Center and take it from there. (Parking can be an issue, but we got there early.)

Rather than cars/buses/RVs/SUVs clogging up the canyon drive, you park in the park's main area and ride the free shuttle bus to the end of the canyon and back, getting on & off at a number of stops to do short or long hikes to waterfalls, ridges, into canyons. You can spend as much or as little time at any stop as the buses come by every 5 minutes or so! A very enjoyable visit. It was raining on our visit which at first I was disappointed by, but in actuality it was GREAT because of so much more waterfall activity!

Zion's Main Canyon,"We only had a few hours to experience Zion on this roadtrip and the Ranger suggested a unique hike up the River. Although very wet - it is now one of our favorites!There is no parking in the park, so you must take the shuttle. This is the best way to see many of the unique formations and colors. We took it to the Temple of Sinawava at the top.About a mile in we met the Virgin River that winds into the Slot Canyons (The Narrows). With a walking pole and non-slip soles we waded into the river for a 2hour stride against the current. This was fun! We were lucky as it was September and the weather and water temp were just perfect. (Always check with the Rangers about safety - this river swells in spring and can have flash floods at any time it rains.) We were wet up to our thighs. It is a bit challenging as the river bottom is slippery and it takes a little balance to manage...but well worth the magnificent cliffs, overhangs and humbling experience of standing within a rock that is millions of years old and a 1'000 + feet high.There were children about 9yrs old plus - big enough to fight the current.Once you have tasted this one - there are many, many other Slot Canyons in Utah to challenge for all levels. This one worked for us - it built memories and filled photo pages.We found that the walking pole was necessary to balance with...and there were some sticks leaning on the rocks at the entrance to the water from previous waders. You can also buy them at the local sports shop outside the Zion entrance.

Zion's Main Canyon,Zion is an excellent place to visit for either a few days or a quick trip. It is pretty much confined to the main valley (unless you want to go off backcountry). In the main season there is a compulsory shuttle (unless you are staying in the Zion Lodge hotel) which keeps cars out and means it is a bit more peaceful. It is also useful for hopping between the trailheads. The Narrows is a must do (from the end of the Riverside Trail upstream only - the trip down the Narrows from its start is a hardcore canyoning trip that needs a permit and full kit). You can do it okay with your normal trail shoes on (we did) but they will get totally wet and you get grit and sand in which can be uncomfortable. If you don't fancy this it may be best to rent some canyoning shoes in town. The hike itself is great and not too risky unless there are flood warnings. It stays cool all day so is something you can do when it is hot in the valley (which it does get!!). If you are okay with drop-offs and scrambling then do Angel's Landing - awesome but not for the feint hearted or unfit - it is a lung and leg busting hike up. For a less demanding hike check out the Emerald Pools and Weeping Rock. The visitor centre and the museum are worth a visit. There is a good introductory movie at the museum. Food etc at Zion Lodge. The drive in or out via the Mt Carmel tunnel is also a must - even if it means going out of your way.,"October 12, 2012",Hot - but cool!,92,"Kirkby Lonsdale, United Kingdom",5

The day we were there it was sunny and warm which brought out all the color in the rocks. Being there in the canyon with towering rockface around us was a humbling yet energizing experience. The park service has done a good job of keeping commercialism down. It's not needed here. The scenery is so overwhelming it takes the breath away.

Zion's Main Canyon,"My first reaction is wow! We entered the park from the east side and hiked the Canyon Overlook Trail which begins just before you enter the long tunnel. This is a must-do hike. It's only one mile, but does climb a bit, but nothing too hard. Hike this in the morning for better pictures. The view is spectacular, probably the best in the park! Be sure to look down and left from the railing and you'll be able to see a ""window"" that was built into the tunnel.The tunnel - a mile long tunnel built in 1930 has several ""windows"" - throughout and what used to be a large pull-out area that's now blocked off. My guess is these look-outs were placed for people to stop and enjoy the scenery along the drive, something that would be impossible now due to traffic. I also want to mention that Zion implemented a shuttle system a few years back and they do a fantastic job! While there are some trailheads you can drive to, you have to get there plenty early to get a spot. There are some areas of the park where cars are not allowed, only the shuttles. You can park at the visitor's center and catch a shuttle. The most we ever waited for a shuttle was a few minutes.

This is one of the more strenuous hikes, and not recommended if you have a fear of heights. The bus system throughout the canyon is excellant. No more than a 7 minute wait for a bus. Do not bring your dog, or you will be very disappointed. There is only one trail that allows doggy hikers. That explains the abundance of Dog Daycare centers on the way to the Park.

Still in the upper 70s/low 80s at 10:00 pm. Very windy, I was worried that the stakes for the tent would be pulled up. There were yellowjackets in just about every campsite.

The next morning we went to Wheeping Rock and did the hike to the Observation Point. Again, even better hike, overall 3h. But always super overlook into the valley.

Had to be one of the most memorable time of my life, Using the shuttle made it so easy, we stayed in Springdale and didn't have to move the car once we got to Canyon Ranch Motel. The view from our motel seemed awesome until we got in the park. We were in Awww, We hiked to the top of Emerald Pools that pm, Sooo pretty! Shared a pizza and pitcher of beer at Noodles & Pizza for a late dinner. The next am we tackled Angles Landing. Very hard hike! Not for anyone scared of heights. Well worth it at the end, The view was unbelievable!!!!. Then went to Wheeping Rock. Spent the evening in Springdale having dinner and seeing the shops. It stormed that night and was raining in the am, We bought some ponchos and went for it. So glad we did!!!! Waterfalls EVERYWHERE! so beautiful! We took the unpaved trail back to Emerald Pools that starts at The Grotto. WOW! much better way to the Pools. Waterfalls everywhere! Was sad to see the sun come out.

The Riverwalk leads to the start of the Narrows Trail. It was great to put my tired feet in the cool water. Shuttle:. Once parked my vehicle never moved. You can take the shuttle to all the trailheads as well as several stops in the town of Springdale. The driver were always friendly and offered great advise on places to eat and shop.

Once in Zion, there are Multiple hikes from .5 miles to 16 miles in the Narrows(one of the most famous hikes on the west coast) We were very fortunate this year as the water was low, no flash floods and the warm air temperatures made the cold water feel Grand!

What I missed out on was getting into the gorge that the Virgin River flows through, since the water levels were too high. The canyon vistas are stunning and the facilities at the lodge for lunch were very good. I also hiked one of the less strenuous walks to Emerald Pools. Unfortunately for me, the weather when I was there was quite hot, which limited my activities.You can take a look at what I saw in part 8 of my web video series ""America's Grand Circle"" where I take a specific look at my journey through Zion National park: https://vimeo.com/47362400","August 11, 2012",Enjoyed my visit!,15,"Adelaide, Australia",4

I can't believe ""real hikers"" have any objection to the shuttle bus system. The lack of cars in the park is surely a bonus. (Try driving in Yellowstone in August!) The fact that you can leave your car parked up and enjoy the stunning scenery is, for me, fantastic. The tip to get the best out of the park is to set your alarm early, get into the park as soon as you can and avoid the heat of the day as well as the majority of people who seem to get there around midday. We shared our walk this morning with a doe and her two fawns as well as the numerous whiptails sunning themselves in the morning warmth.

There is a balcony that you can sit on and look at the beautiful scenery. Also, not much traffic because you have to have a pass to get to the lodge and then you take a bus to go around the park so you can look around. The buses come every few minutes so you can easily move arount the park. Loved going up Angel's landing and the hidden valley hikes, little hard going up, but it was worth it.

This is the most amazing place. I have been to other canyons in Utah and Zion is the best for hiking. Angels Landing is experienced hikers - most can get a good feel for the park hiking a portion of this trail but the last part is all up the side of the rock on the chain. It is windy up there and you must watch your footing. The landing is small and drops off on all sides.

The oasis of cottonwood trees and other greenery at the bottom by the fast flowing Virgin river which is accessible at many points make this a truly unforgettable experience. The National Park costs 25 dollars to enter , amazing value. I loved that the roads within the main part of the canyon area are kept mostly free of cars and an excellent free shuttle runs frequently up and down with a recorded tour guide. I also loved that the road itself was in a dark red echoing the colours of the canyon and the Canyon Lodge and other buildings were camouflaged into their surroundings. The information centre is a great resource for advice on trails for all abilities, even at least one accessible by wheelchair . They also run a great junior ranger programme. In addition there are films and a museum and well displayed info about the park.

We got an early start which is very important and we were well prepared, had the right clothes (we stoppped at columbia sports wear at the outlets in parkcity utah). It was very warm in Zions but the temperature can drop as you are hiking up the narrows in water. Our clothes dried out quickly so we stayed refreshed. Plenty of water in our back packs, great hiking shoes with toe covers to protect your toes from the rocks and hiking sticks are very important. We hiked about 6-8 hours the first day.2nd day we hiked Angels landing first thing in the morning, which was perfect since the day exceeded 100 degs. Wow this hike is not for those who are afraid of heights! But it is well worth the trip to the top and make sure you bring your camera!

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zions was our 18 year old's favourite of the 4 national parks that we visited on this trip because of the variety of scenery it offers. The highlight of our day at Zion NP was hiking the Narrows for 3 hours. This hike is special because you spend about half of the time in the Virgin River. The cool water depth during our hike varied from ankle to waist deep. A great experience! Checking the flash flooding forecast is critical and can be done at the visitor center (possible other places as well). I would call this hike moderate if you are prepared, but the park calls it strenuous. Probably very strenuous if you did the entire 12 miles. We only went in @ 1.5 miles. The park's information will tell you what you need, but water, good shoes (my boys used their hiking boots and I used Keens) and a hiking stick are the minimum in the hot summer months.We also did a few other short hikes and drove the entire hiway 9 route which is very beautiful and worth the time.

However, when I brought my family this year, we took the shuttle bus and hiked on two trails. We hiked the Pa'rus Trail in the evening, and it was extremely hot. I thought I was prepared for the heat with a cooling tie and a hydration pack, but it was hot enough I was starting to get sick. Fortunately, I had read a review that said to take water shoes. The trail crosses the Virgin River in multiple places, and my daughters and I changed to water shoes and jumped in for a very refreshing swim. After my body temperature had cooled down, the rest of the hike was great. The next morning, we hiked the Riverside Walk, which is absolutely one of the most beautiful hikes I've ever been on in my whole life. Again, it's helpful to have water shoes, because at the end of the trail, the ""Narrows"" begins, and even though we didn't ""hike"" them, it was fun to play around in them for about an hour before heading back again.","July 6, 2012",Pa'rus Trail and Riverside Walk,27,"Buffalo, Missouri",5

The drive into Zion is spectacular and that is before you even get to the main section of the park. Here you park your car and board the shuttle buses which take you to all of the main trails. It was so convenient and we loved not having to hassle with parking issues. We arrived early which is best because it did get a bit crowded later in the day. Plus hiking is better in the morning because some of the trails are sun exposed which can be brutal later in the heat of the day.

You don't have to be an ardent and devoted hiker to explore its idiosyncracies and more remote reaches. Even if you don't have much tikme and are 'just passing' - maybe between Bryce and Vegas on the northern route loping aorund the Grand cvanyon, dio take the time ti explore at least the main canyon.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion's offers a lot of color and diverse beauty throughout the canyon, and you can take hikes in lengths that fit any level of adventure. We decided to visit one day in the early evening after the day crowds and heat were gone. The shuttle bus still runs and is very convenient, but the hikes were in cooler weather and more pleasant. Plus the shading on the mountains provides different colors than you see at other times in the day.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion is so wonderful, it takes your breath away. To be on the floor of this park really makes you feel so small. The shuttle bus is a great way to see the park. I wish more parks would do the same thing. We got to the park at 3:00 pm and the colors were great. We had time to hiked on some of the trails and really enjoyed using the shuttle. The shuttles ran until 10:00pm and we got to see most of the of the park. I would come back here again and stay in the area longer. We caught the shuttle in Springdale, UT. But we stayed at hotel in Hurricane, UT. Which was only a 1/2 hour easy drive from Springdale, UT. I had packed a light picnic and lots of water to drink. There was drinking water areas all around the park.","June 25, 2012","""Another of God creations""",3,"Mishicot, Wisconsin, USA",5

Also, the recorded narration runs one direction only, so you're not bored listening to it all day long. I did the Riverside walk in the morning, and did weeping rock right before lunch at the lodge. The lodge has a buffet, but we ordered off the menu. Then my hubby did the pool hike after lunch, I took the shuttle into Springdale. You need your Zion admission receipt to re-enter if you go to Springdale.P.S. #1 Some of the restrooms on the map are really porta-potties.P.S. #2 Bbe sure to look for the ostrich farm a few miles before entering the park from Springdale!","June 20, 2012","Excellent shuttle service, great scenery",58,"orange county, ca",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"I grew up ""doing Zion's"". But I had never taken my two boys. I was really hoping to take them on something super adventurous, but the heat really wiped them out. We ended up taking the shuttle to the top of the main canyon and hiking up the narrows for a bit. This was a great choice because the water kept them cool. At one point it was clear up to their chests and up to my waist. They loved it and were happy. It helped to have Camelbaks on them so that they could drink whenever they wanted and still have their hands free to balance themselves. I actually recommend one of those walking sticks as well. It looked like many people had sticks from Zion Adventure - those were really thick. I think the hiking poles that retract worked better. I was happy that all of us were in Keen sandals, although our feet froze at the beginning - we got used to it.After we did that hike we stopped at Weeping Rock - which is one of the coolest sites ever. They loved it. If you look up right as you get to the rock - it is an amazing sight to behold the water droplets coming right at your face in the sunlight. Stunning.Next we stopped at the Lodge for the $3 ice cream cones and the $5 fruit smoothie. We sat out on the lawn under the huge trees. A great comfortable spot for a rest.Our boys looked too tired to do Emerald Pools - or that would have been next. They are quite active kids, so it wasn't the endurance, it was the heat.We spent the night in Watchman campground behind the visitor center. With the high fire alert, we roasted hot dogs over the stove flame and ate a bunch of fruit. The neatest thing about the campground is the location. With our rain fly off we lay in bed and watch the sunlight creep up the canyon walls as we fell asleep.Next time I will take them in October to do some of the more difficult hiking.","June 10, 2012",One day with a 10 year old and a 7 year old in June,54,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"I have been to Zion many times and still feel like I am just scratching the surface. This is one of the most gorgeous parks in the US/World. The crowds are huge, yes, but it is easy to get away from them if you aren't afraid to hike. Do Angels Landing if you are fit (in the early am ie start before dawn). This (2012) is a great year to hike up the Virgin river towards the Narrows, as the water levels are low. If you can, come in the fall, even after the snow starts--it is entirely different but still gorgeous. The shuttle is a little off-putting but really works very well, and the wildlife has truly benefited from the lack of cars, which is to say you see wildlife now, which was rare 20 years ago. Plan to come here more than once. It has always been a sacred place (which is how it got its name).","June 8, 2012",The queen of National Parks,21,"Grand Junction, Colorado",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"We can't get enough of it. From the variations in the rock to the flora and fauna, it quickly becomes apparent why the main canyon is such a tourist draw.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion National Park is one of the best national (or state) parks that I've ever visited. If you are a geology or ecology buff, or just interested in seeing one of the U.S.'s great natural wonders, you should go. Yes, it is crowded, but I found that they did a good job handling the crowds through the buses (which run through peak season) and the facilities along the way. There are plenty of good bathrooms, several places to fill water or buy food, and even enough trash receptacles. For folks who are really hard-core geology buffs, and who do not need all of the amenities of Zion, I would recommend Capitol Reef National Park, which is about four hours north near Torrey, Utah. In our short visits to both parks, we saw a greater diversity of geological features and ecosystems in Capitol Reef and it is much less crowded. It is also at higher elevation so it's cooler in the summer. Zion is wonderful, particularly if you have a family as it is well-designed to accommodate people of different ages and abilities; Capitol Reef may be better for people who want to rough it more and avoid crowds.","June 5, 2012",Very well-run national park with spectacular scenery,149,Florida,4

Zion's Main Canyon,"Unfortunately, like many of the National Parks, Zion has been hurt by its own success. There are just too many visitors for the park to manage. We went for the sunrise two days in a row and had no trouble getting into the park, but by 9:00 the crowds were terrible. The shuttle helps, but there is no way to find solitude in the park, short of rock climbing (which I do not do). We had visited Arches and Canyonlands the week prior to this visit and it was an altogether better experience, but then Arches and Canyonland take some work to get to.On the plus side, the scenery is beautiful, as you would expect, and the park staff are courteous and helpful and good at managing the crowds.","June 1, 2012",Hurt by its success,148,Wa.

Zion's Main Canyon,"The Narrows, known as the grandfather of slot canyons, is at the north end of Zion National Park. Hiking The Narrows involves hiking up the Virgin River bed through awesome sandstone monoliths on either side. If thunderstorms are predicted or the river is high, hikers are prevented from making the journey. Our day involved cooler air temperatures and 53 degree river water. We opted for the boots (helpful in creating stable foot placements on the river rocks), neoprene socks, and dry pants, secured through Zion Adventure Company in Springdale, just outside the park. We thought they would be hot but they were not. They made for a comfortable trip, and we undoubtedly went farther, more comfortably, than we would have without them. It's an awesomely beautiful hike, and it was terrific to achieve this long-term goal.","May 31, 2012",Hiking The Narrows at Zion National Park,67,"Richmond, Virginia",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Wonderful natural beauty abounds in Zion. It is well worth seeing and contains dramatic sandstone cliffs. We were there over Memorial Day weekend with thousands of others. The poor park rangers seemed a bit overwhelmed, and weren't around to keep the massive crowds off of the easily disturbed areas near the trails. There are several terrific hikes to do including The Narrows (cool slot canyon but you have to be able to walk through water over wet rocks), Angels Landing (if you aren't afraid of heights) and Emerald Pools. We encountered trails so full of people that we were often just following along like we were on a single file city sidewalk. Most park visitors are very nice, but some could use a few basic trail etiquette lessons.

Their tram system is very efficient and prompt, the drivers very helpful. We chose to stay in Springdale and not inside the park at the lodge as Xantera food service has proven to be disappointing. There is also a tram that runs outside the park from many convenient stops in the town and drops you right outside the gate for a short walk to the Visitor Center where the inside-the-park tram system starts. No need to get in the car until you leave for home! The many hiking trails are ranked using a system that is very helpful and accurate. We found that getting an early start to the more popular hikes helped avoid the crowds and organized tours.

Zion's Main Canyon,On our recent trip to Zion National Park we found the shuttle buses both in Springdale and the park itself a wonderful resourse. Leave your car at the hotel unless you have multiple bicycles with you. The shuttle stopped right outside our hotel and the drivers were all very helpful and well informed about local amenities. We changed buses at the Zion Visitors' Center which might be a hassle if you have small children and strollers (we didn't) and then we took the park shuttle to our first hike. The recorded information on the park shuttle was informative and useful.I really liked the fact that the shuttles in Zion radically reduced the amount of visitor car traffic and made for such a peaceful environment. We walked a couple of paths quite close to the road and enjoyed the peace and quiet with only the fairly hushed sound of the buses passing. Much more relaxing than the constant flow of traffic in Yosemite.Admittedly we were there right at the start of the tourist season. There could be longer waits in the height of summer but something tells me that these folks have really got their act together and are making the most of their resources whilst protecting them at the same time.

They say it handicapped accessible, I'm not handicapped and it was very steep in some parts.

It's past there. Drive past the museum and you'll see a bridge that looks directly at the mountain.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion was the first NP I went to (my 3rd visit there spanning 30 years) on my month-long tour of the Utah/Arizona natural attractions last year.I have compiled an extensive Trip Advisor 'Trip List' for my tour, which includes 'extra' attractions and also has links to the other individual TA reviews I've contributed for the accommodation/attractions I visited - it has been made a Trip Advisor 'Itinerary'; I hope it is of interest and use to you - I plan to add visitor information sections/viewable media sections..... The most direct way to access it is by clicking my review-count below my profile name to the left of this review text. Alternatively, see after my review below the dashed line... This review is for the NP as a whole, I have posted separate reviews for individual trails (introduced at the end of this review). DO note that nearby Kolob Canyons (separate TA webpage and review for that) is part of Zion NP. Unless you have an 'Interagency Annual Pass' you need to visit it within the Zion ticket 7-day period otherwise you'll have to pay another entrance fee. I bought one at Kolob Canyons after a few days as I then knew I'd be coming back on my return leg several weeks later - they refunded the Zion Canyon fee I'd already paid which was extremely gracious.Zion was MUCH busier than it was for me on previous visits, starting some 30 years ago - it is also, dare I say it, more 'commercial' than it used to be. I remember my first arrival via the Mt Carmel tunnel in a Greyhound coach and then walking around in near isolation, not possible now... Visitor numbers are usually in excess of 300,000 PER MONTH; a total almost equal to the numbers of all the other Utah NPs combined ! The terrain has obviously not changed, but the infrastructure has - travel is now by mandatory (included in the entry price) shuttle bus which does work well but can get crowded. to that end, entrance by car and parking can be problematic if you arrive 'late'....The Visitor Centre CP is the natural place to park and that can often be full; the only true alternative is a little further north on the other side of the road in the MUCH smaller CP for the 'Zion Human History Museum' (which has a shuttle stop). A last-ditch parking area is around the junction where the canyon road becomes 'shuttle only'; there are some lay-bys there and you can then walk the very short distance north to the 'Canyon Junction' shuttle stop.Trail signposting and management is now a bit shoddy - the more remote ones may be on the supplied map, but don't expect anything at the location itself to aid you; a separate trail guide book can often be essential for the trails pictured on the supplied map but are not then detailed.Park facilities are good - you can refill water bottles for example quite readily and rest rooms/food outlets are handily located; the more remote areas might have facilities but they are more 'rustic' in nature (it can be a good idea to take some hand wipes with you....). The best way to get a feel for the park is to view the main park map from the NPS website - after that you can 'expand' your investigations ! From my experience most NP shop items here are more expensive than other NPs, with Bryce Canyon offering the best value, choice and offers or at Canyonlands if you travel further !Keep an eye on the trail closure board at the Visitor Centre; the start of closed trails themselves might be boarded-off, but if you plan to join them from another trail you'll only find out when you get to the junction - which is usually too late to avoid an unplanned and more lengthy re-route !Of course, all those gripes are relatively minor and pale in comparison when you consider the fantastic views you will be presented with in around the canyon as you walk the huge number of trails or just gaze at things from somewhere near a shuttle stop....The 'Watchman Trail' is a good ground-breaker to start your visit and it's easy to access the trailhead. Other less strenuous, but nonetheless still picturesque, trails are the almost unused (and poorly notified, it's on the map but not annotated or signposted !) 'Sand Bench' trail, the popular 'Emerald Pools' trail, the Temple of Sinawava trail, the Weeping Rock trail, the Riverside Walk and the more remote 'Canyon Overlook' trail as you exit east after the tunnel.See my individual reviews.A visit to Zion NP is absolutely essential and several days are really need to get the maximum benefit. If at all possible, going out-of-season should definitely be considered as the popular periods really can 'reveal' the massive visitor numbers to their worst and potentially make things a little unfulfilling.I will add any relevant photos/videos after this review is posted by TA.----------------------------As well as the method described near the start of this review my TA 'Trip List' can also be accessed from the 'Utah Itineraries' link on the right of the Utah Forum page.

The steep canyon walls, narrow creek gorges, hairpin turns and the views are memorable. It is worth the time and gives you a good panorama of the whole park. The Canyon scenic drive is also worthy and we made numerous stops to see the spring snow thaw albeit very little.

I would definetly recommend seeing this off season. I just came back and already there was a good number of people. There's a shuttle system through the park and it was pretty packed much of the time, so I can only imagine during peak season how crowded that would get. Plus the visitor's center and lodge restaurant had a good number of people utilizing the services during this off season time that I can imagine it being unpleasant during peak season. The food at the lodge's restaurant was very good and worth the extra cost vs the faster food option","April 14, 2012",Must see - but go off season,38,Seattle,5

Zion's Main Canyon,"We visited the Zion National Park on a Friday night and picked up a map. We spoke briefly to a very helpful ranger inside the visitor center. The center was closing but we were able to get on the bus that takes you through the drive in the park. My girls (14,11,7) were mesmerized by all the wildlife we saw. It was absolutely beautiful to see 'families' of animals walking around. I made it a point to wake up early the next day and take a hike in one of the trails. I was a bit adventurous and wanted to take the 5 mile trail. I am glad my husband suggested we try the shortest one with a water attraction. So off we went the next day. Packed snacks, camera, bug spray, water and towels. Not sure what the name of the trail it was we were walking but it definitely had a pond of some sort for my girls to look forward to in our hike. Ten minutes into our hike we come across a HUGE deer in our path. Mind you the path is narrow enough for only two people. I stayed calm and held hands with my little one. We were scared because the deer was looking at us weird and we weird looking at the deer just as weird. I reminded my girls that we were in the deers home and need to be respectful. As soon as I said this the deer bounced off the trail and stood by to let us go through. That was a wonderful connection with the animals of the park. The sun was getting warmer and the temperature was rising. My daughter got a nosebleed and thankful we were under this beautiful mountain like cave with a small waterfall, enough to wet a towel and clean up the nosebleed. This was a relief due to rising temperature. We sighted a hawk, a snake and beautiful birds. Not sure how long we were into our hike, but my girls were getting tired and turning bright red. We found a big rock to stand under to rest from the scorching sun and keep hiking. We all were wondering when we would get to the 'water' attraction. We kept going and just as we were about to turn around to head back for fear of dehydration and exhaustion we felt a cool breeze. WE FOUND the beautiful little pool of water that collected water from this humongous mountain with falling water. It was absolutely breathtaking. We all had a wonderful time at the Zion National Park and would recommend it to anyone wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. It felt so good to smell nature and be with my family.","March 17, 2012",Great Walk,14,"Chicago, Illinois",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion National Park was simply stunning in beauty. We stayed in the Zion Lodge within the park. We took advantage of the various hiking opportunities in the park, but a person wouldn't have to hike to see nature. The favorite hikes of our trip include The Narrows, Angel's Landing, Canyon Overlook Trail, and Emerald Pool Trail. We also hired guide from Red Desert Adventure to take our group canyoneering. I was thankful that our trip was in March. The week that we were there, the weather was perfect. Chilly in the mornings but by late morning, we wore light jackets. Locals told us that during the summer temps are normally over 100 degrees for at least two months.We had an amazing trip to Zion NP.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion is breathtaking, and well worth the trip. After early April, you must take the shuttle into the canyon, so allow time for that.A great walk/hike is the one starting at the Temple if Sinawa at the end of the main canyon road. You can walk in the river, assuming you are attired properly if it's still cold, or careful to heed earnings in stormy seasons. There is a lovely walk along the path next to the river which is not difficult.Across from the Zion Lodge, a much more challenging hike is to start the Angel's Landing trail. You go up Wally's Wiggles to Scout lookout, and can see the very difficult trail up to Angel's Landing. we did not do this;I recommend that for experienced folks who do not fear steep drp offs. you can continue up from Scout lookout on the West Rim Trail. We went about another 3/4 mile. It is long, so be prepared if you are doing the full length.Getting down is interesting vpbecause it is steep, and the day we hiked, incredibly windy. the hot tub felt wonderful.","March 12, 2012","Awesome, Spectacular, Humbling",102,"Lakewood Ranch, Florida",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"I visited Zion National Park on a trip that also included Bryce Canyon and both rims of the Grand Canyon. When considering the four locations, both I and my spouse agreed that we enjoyed Zion best. At the other parks, you are above the scenery, looking down on it. While I was amazed by the landscapes at those parks, I also felt small and vulnerable standing on the canyon rims; the views were so mammoth that they were hard to take in. At Zion, you are enclosed in the main canyon at all times, unless you take a trail up a canyon wall. This feeling of being sheltered and surrounded by beauty is somehow viscerally satisfying. Zion Canyon's location is also more convenient than many of the other parks of the southwest (depending upon your starting point, of course). Instead of being tens of miles from anywhere, the canyon entrance lies next to the town of Springdale, which has good lodging and dining alternatives to the park; and both Springdale and Zion are an easy drive from Las Vegas. I still recommend staying in Zion Lodge (please see my separate review) because otherwise you'd miss the quiet moments that are unexpectedly refreshing.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We spent a week in Springdale, Utah last October and it was an excellent vacation for both my husband and I. He is an avid golfer and on several days, took our car to nearby St. George to golf. The fact that I was without a vehicle wasn't a problem at all because there's a shuttle in the town of Springdale that runs every ten minutes (down the entire main street (where pretty much all the hotels, shops and restaurants are) to the entrance of Zion National Park. Entrance to the park is only $12 per person or $25 per family for seven days. Once in the park there is another shuttle that runs the entire length of the Zion Canyon Scenic drive. Both these shuttles are free and you can get on and off where ever you like. This is an excellent destination for both couples and solo travelers alike. Springdale has many fine restaurants and wonderful shops - everything being within walking distance (you can also use the shuttle if you like). Of course the canyon itself is utterly awesome - photographers' paradise! Note if you're there to take pictures, a wide angle lens is a must. There are hikes for all fitness levels and the weather for it was perfect in mid-October. I spent five days in the canyon and still didn't do everything I wanted to!

I haven't seen a more beautiful, albeit baron, landscape in the west. It was 109*F when we when, which was excruciating, but it was definitely worth it. Once in the canyon, you are sheltered by the cliffs. I highly recommend doing the River Side Walk. It is beautiful and you can cool off in the freezing river that runs through the canyon. When you get to the end of the River Side Walk path, keep going! wade through the river twice more and you will have spectacular cliffs on either side of you. I went until ther was no more land, only water to wade through before turning around. It was the most memorable part of the trip.Also, on the way back to Vegas, there was a little store/restaurant where you can get a great burger and take pictures in a recreated old western town.

Zion's Main Canyon,"My husband and I are outdoorsy people and loved our visit to Zion National Park. The park is very large and only has two main entrances, so you need at least 2-3 days to explore some of its highlights. No cars are allowed in this section of the park except for a scenic drive along Mt. Carmel Highway. Admission to the park includes use of a shuttle system that works quite well throughout the park. We never had to wait more than 5 minutes for a shuttle. We purchased a weekly pass for $25. The fee is per vehicle.The park can get quite crowded, so keep this in mind when planning your trip. We stayed in St. George while exploring the southern part of the park (Zion Canyon entrance), and it took about an hour to get to the park entrance. Closer hotels are booked weeks ahead, even for September!There are places to eat in the park, and the food was pretty good. Prices were in line for park food. We brought backpacks with snacks and water.The best part of our visit was hiking along the Virgin River in a section called the Zion Narrows. You can hike as far as five miles up river without a permit. Most of this hike is in the river, but there are plenty of rocks and sand bars to sit and take a break. While the water is cold, this canyon hike is too beautiful to miss. Recommended are neoprene socks and heavy duty water shoes- NOT open toe flip-flop like shoes! I found a natural walking stick at the beginning of the hike and was glad I grabbed it. Shoes and sticks can be rented. The water can get deep in areas so keep your electronics in a dry bag (waterproof). The northern section of the park (Kolob Canyons) is just as beautiful and MUCH less crowded. We had a great hike along Taylor Creek. We stayed in Cedar City to access this part of the park and it was about a 30-40 minute drive to the Kolob visitors center entrance.Weather in September was great; cool mornings, warming to about 75-80F by afternoon. Dressing in layers was necessary. We wish we had more time and can't wait to get back and explore more of this amazing park.","January 5, 2012","Amazing park, full of color; try to go in off season",40,"Richmond, Virginia",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"The coach pulled up and we were informed as to just how much time we had. Back on the bus in one and a half hours - how much could you see in that time? As it turned out, quite a bit.Despite advice to the contrary I jumped on the excellent local bus run by the Parks service. Acting on the driver's advice I alighted at Horseshoe Bend. To say I was gobsmacked would be something of an understatement. With shaking head I didn't know where to turn, so stunning was the vista. In a lifetime of visiting national parks, this was a highlight.The massive ramparts rose in every direction, each one vying for your eye, flaunting different colours and shapes to beggar the imagination.Slowly I started walking back to Weeping Rock and the grandest vista of all, the panorama looking across to the Great White Throne, overwhelmed me as I tarried awhile taking photos.Eventually I reached the Weeping Rock and saw walkers on high and envied the amount of time they had here and so wanted to be up there with them.Still, Weeping Rock is worth a look; it goes without saying that after rain is best but, since that's something that doesn't happen a lot around these parts, you'll probably just have to take what you get.I caught the bus back to the first stop and then walked back to base. Every 50 metres is another postcard, a different angle on this fabulous national park.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Only tips...1. Get there early in the morning, park your car and ride the free shuttle buses (you don't have the choice anyway).2. Don't spend time in the visitor center now, do it later (before leaving). You already have the map, they give it to you when you enter the park and pay the fee.3. Your first stop off the bus should be the museum, especially to have a good look and take pictures of the Towers of the Virgin, situated behind the museum (best in the morning sun). If you wish, take a fast stroll around the museum but if you want to take your time in the museum, I would recommend doing it later, maybe just before leaving.4. Now that you are back on the bus, ride it all the way to the last stop (Temple of Sinawava). The reason is that at this time of the day (morning), everybody is riding the bus down the canyon and if you get out at other stops, it will be packed when you will try to get back on the bus. You will be able to make all the other stops on your way back in the late morning and afternoon.5. Now that you are at the Temple of Sinawava, walk the Virgin River trail. It is all paved, flat and easy (wheelchair accessible). If you had plan doing the Narrows, it starts at the end of the river trail (but for the Narrows, you must be planning this trail ahead of getting there).6. Leaving the Temple of Sinawava, make a stop at all the other bus stops and choose the trails that you feel like doing. I recommend Weaping Rock, short and easy with beautiful and fun view. I also recommend the West Rim trail leading to Angel's Landing (starts at the Grotto bus stop). Even if you don't do it all the way to the top of Angel's Landing, the West Rim trail is nice and you can decide to turn around anytime.7. Back on the bus, stop at the Court of the Patriarches for a nice view of the Patriarches peaks.8. Don't forget to stop at the museum and the visitor center if not already done before.9. Enjoy Zion ! ...a day is not enough but if you have an early start and plan well, you can see a lot (the main attractions, views and trails) and not rush.","November 19, 2011","The definition of the word ""Zion"" tells it all",375,"Mirabel, Qc",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion National Park is a great place to visit. The main canyon has amazing scenery and it changes a lot during the seasons. I've been lucky enough to visit in spring, summer, and fall (different years). You can see a lot from the shuttle, but if you can do some day hiking you will see even more. But plan your visit carefully and make sure you have plenty of water and snacks with you so you have a great visit. If you can stay inside the park that would be great, or if you spend the day and stay at any of the Springdale hotels that would be great too. I've done day trips from Las Vegas but it's a very LONG day. Parking inside Zion can be challenging. If you stay at Zion Lodge you can park there and use the park shuttles from there. If you stay in Springdale, use the park shuttles from there. They run regularly (check the schedule at www.nps.gov) during peak times (not winter) and will make your visit much more enjoyable when you can get on the shuttle sooner. During peak times you cannot access the main park areas except on the shuttle, so plan accordingly. The first trip I made to Zion I did not plan ahead and as a result I missed a lot.

Zion's Main Canyon,If you are visiting Zion National Parks you have to consider doing the Narrows hike in the canyon. Summer would be the best time of yr to do this if you have an intolerance to cold water but you can get a dry suit locally and any gear you would need to get you going. We did this in Oct of this yr. and the weather was colder than normal. We decided not to use the dry suit and really did not need it although the water temps were 55 degree. Your skin gets use to the cold quickly. If you want an experience like no other I would recommend this hike to anyone who is able to walk over rough terraine at times and through water and small rapids in some areas. When we first started our trek we came upon the first of many challanges about 1/8 of a mile in we had to go into chest deep water. Fortunately the ground under our feet was sandy and we did not have to walk over rocks. You MUST HAVE walking sticks which can be rented. Trying to do this hike without them is not a good idea. We did 6 miles in before turning around. Remember whatever distance you go forward you will have to do going back. I am 59 yrs old and not an athelete and I did it. Pack a lunch in a waterproof bag. It is a good idea to also pack some dry clothes. We removed our tops and outer layers on top when going through chest deep water. That way you are not cold all over. We had fast drying wicking clothes so it worth the cost of being comfortable. I would not recommend this for very small children as the water in some areas would be over their heads. The sights of the hike are remarkable though and walking within the high walls of the canyon are breathtaking. Some area's where the sun breaks through are the best spots to stop and have lunch along the way. The sun's warmth revitalizes you and gets you amped up to continue your journey. In the summer when the temps are very hot there are amazing places along the hike that the water is crystal clear and would be a refreshing way to cool off with a swim. This by far was the highlight of the trip for me. The exhilaration of being in cold water and traversing over rocks and rapids makes you feel alive. Do not be afraid to take a chance and do this. The only risk you have is not taking the opportunity to do this while in Zion.,"October 31, 2011",Amazing hike in the Narrows,52,"Waynesboro, Virginia",5
Zion's Main Canyon,On our trip Las Vegas we decided to rent a car and drive the 2 hours to Zion National Park. Boy were we glad we did. It is a beautiful national park with free bus tours thru out the park. We decided to walk a mile trail which gave us a different perspective of the park. It was breathtaking. We also drove thru the tunnel which was beautiful but like going up Pikes Peaks. I would highly recommend the trip.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion National Park is a must see in the National Park System. There is a great view every time you turn around. The free shuttle system is fast and efficient and keeps many cars off the park roads. There is also a free shuttle that runs from the park into nearby Springdale. You never spend more than 10 minutes waiting for a bus! Grand Canyon needs a shuttle system this good. The sandstone cliffs are amazing. In the fall, the trees are beautiful as they change color.

Zion's Main Canyon,"My wife and I have just come back from a 1 week trip to Utah. We stayed in St. George, UT and went around to several state parks as well as Zion National Park. We are both glad we did the Zion visit. We had planned on going to Bryce as well, but an important connecting route (Route 14 from Cedar City) has been shut down by a rock slide which won't be repaired and reopened for some time (so we are told). We did trhe Kolob Canyon section of Zion visit on one day, and followed up with a visit to the main park the next. Since we aren't into hiking, a shuttle bus tour provided us with some good insight into the park's special spots, and also a background on it's formation. There is hiking, rock climbing, camping and canyoneering available (see park website for fees). If you are looking for a place, do it!. St. George is 130 miles from Las Vegas, so access to the area is convenient. I'll add some pictures later.Copied from the park website: Accessibility in Zion The park visitor centers, museum, restrooms, shuttle buses, picnic areas, and Zion Lodge are accessible. Several campsites are reserved for people with disabilities, and the Pa’rus Trail and Riverside Walk offer accessible hikes. Service dogs are permitted on a leash throughout the park.

I am of the opinion that Zio0ns National Park has better views of the surrounding cliffs, has the trail up the narrow gorge at the upper end and the road out has a tunnel just inside a cliff face over a mile long. Zions National Park should be on everyone's ""bucket list"".

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion NP was the last stop on our 2-week Utah trip. We left the condo before daybreak and arrived at the East entrance to Zion about 9AM. The sun was still fairly low in the sky and provided some nice shadows for perspective on Checkboard Mesa. We arrived at the Visitor’s Center early enough to get a parking space in their lot. (When we came back from the shuttle ride to the end of the canyon, the lot was full.) We decided to take the shuttle all the way to the end and work our way back one stop at a time. Originally I thought the shuttles were going to be a hassle but I found out one was able to stand in the middle of the road to take pictures without fearing for one’s life. The limited use of personal cars in the canyon during the peak tourist season is a good idea. When a person looks at the Virgin River it’s hard to imagine it cutting this huge chasm through solid rock. Then we saw some of the damage it had done this past spring. The shuttle driver said the river was running at about 65 cfm this day; this past spring it ran as high as 3000-5000 cfm! There were full grown cottonwood trees lying on their sides where the river had dropped them. No wonder they warn you about flash floods when hiking The Narrows! The skies had some nice clouds this day and our pictures came out wonderfully. Zion is one of the most popular NP’s and with good reason.

Zion's Main Canyon,"This is my 3rd visit over the last 20 years to Zion. This place is very very special and words will never do it justice. You just have to go and experiance it. I took my husband for his first visit and he was entralled. We walked ""The Narrows"" . For me a real achievement as I dont do cold water! Trust me it's worth a bit of cold water up to your chest to experiance The Narrows so give it a go if you are moderately fit. If you dont want to do that walk there are plenty of other softer or harder options....or if your a real couch potato just doing the Zion Canyon shuttle tour gives you some wonderful views. The national park service offers a wonderful service in this national park..a real credit to them and the drivers are all delightful and very well informed.For photography buffs stay at least a couple of days to catch the different lights that are offered from morning to afternoon. There are some real wonderful opportunities here for some breath taking shots.Also the small town that services Zion is delightful, great galleries, eateries (The Spotted Dog is excellent!) and friendly people.Zion National Park should be on everyones ""Bucket List'.

Zion's Main Canyon,"This is one of the most stunning visual works of nature we've ever seen! The splendor and majesty is undescribable! There is beauty around every corner and we were constantly amazed. Needless to say, this is a photographer's delight - amateur or professional. During the peak months, cars aren't allowed in the park - exceptionally smart!!! The shuttle system is phenomenal! We never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for the next bus and, with a couple of exceptions, there was plenty of room on them. There is a recording that provides history and information that is facinating and enjoyable.Depending upon how active you want to be, you can make this trip last either one or two days. If you're not going to do the long hikes, one day will do it if you get to the park early. Each stop has wonderful scenery and short hikes to enjoy. If you want to endulge in some of the longer, tougher hikes plan on at least two days. Our favorite hike was the Canyon Overlook trail, but the Emerald Pools was fun, too. The Riverwalk is another shorter hike that everyone can participate in. There is far too much to talk about regarding Zion - just make sure you see it. It will be one of the best trips you've taken.","September 26, 2011",Spectacular and breathtaking,245,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5

We went to a ranger talk on pollinators and my daughter spent all afternoon pointing out flowers the ranger had talked about in the talk. We also went on the river walk (the paved walk that ends at The Narrows.) It was a lovely walk. I wish we'd have had the time to do more hiking as this looks like a fantastic place to do that.

Zion's Main Canyon,"I have just started hiking recently and visited Zion last week. It is a paradise for hikers, climbers, campers, adventurers. Cars are left in a parking lot and visitors take regularly scheduled buses to lessen pollution and preserve the environment. The hiking trails vary from easy to moderate to difficult. Paths are clearly marked and some trails have wheelchair access too. Each trail provides a different scenery, challenge and experience. The park has various terrains, vegetation and animals. There is a museum, a gift shop and a lodge inside the park. There are areas for campers and trailers too. There is a stream flowing in most of the paths. I went through some waterfalls too. The park is just breath taking and has something for everyone. There are also picnic areas for those who want to bring their lunch or snacks. The trails are clean, I did not see any liter any where. The temperature during this time of the year was perfect with a light jacket in the morning and by noon, just light clothing. The no smoking policy should be emphasized here. I saw about 4 people smoking and this could be dangerous for the park. Toilet facilities and water refill stations were ample. Shuttle buses that ran the loop were very effecient. I believe there are rangers that can go with small groups to the difficult hikes. The park charges an entrance reasonable entrance fee by car.I would love to go back here and do the other hikes. There are about 10 different trails and was only able to do 3 of the easy ones in one day. I would like to do the moderate ones and spend more time since it is a photographer's paradise too.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion is an absolutely amazing place! So much beautiful scenery and the trails really give you a great way to experience the canyon. We went to the top of Angel's Landing which is a 5 mile round trip hike. The last .5 miles is along the cliff holding on to chains attached to the mountain. Very challenging both physically and mentally. Definitely not for those scared of heights. But view at the end is so worth it! We also hiked through the narrows. That was probably our favorite hike. The water was chilly, but comfortable to hike through. Every turn was just beautiful. The further we hiked in, the better it got. Next time we go, I would recommend a full day just for this hike.The shuttle going into the park was super easy to use and finding the right trail for your hiking level was easy to figure out. We even enjoyed just hanging out at the Zion Lodge and having a cold beer and enjoying the scenery.

Zion's Main Canyon,"We take our family to Zion National Park every year, it is so beautiful and such a great vacation for almost everyone. There are hikes for every age and every skill of hiker. There are also great day camps and classes for kids. My kids participated in the Junior Ranger program and learned all about the California Condor, which resides in the canyon. There are paved hikes, and non paved hikes. Some are flat, and some are steep. The virgin river runs through the canyon and is a great place to cool off after hiking all day. I also love the information given to you when you enter the canyon, and the information given when you are on the tram. It informs you of all of the wildlife, the different hikes, the plants, the origin and discovery of the canyon, etc. It makes it so much more fun to be here when you are knowledgeable of the place you are visiting. I also love the tram that takes you to each hike. You definitely need more than one day here in the park. There are so many hikes and places to see.

We took our children,one in a stroller, on a trail just across from the 1st lodge and it was perfect for us.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Just when I'd think that it couldn't possibly get more beautiful, I'd come around the bend or over the ridge and it was even more gorgeous. What can I say? I've run out of superlatives. This national park is so well-organized with a free shuttle with jumping off spots for every trail and places to fill your water bottle at just about every stop. I walked up to Hidden Canyon and along the Riverside Walk. Also took the 3 min walk up to get a better look at ""The Court of the Patriarchs"" around sunset. Got off to lay on a low lying wall and look up at the stars at night - virtually no lights around so it's amazing.

Zion's Main Canyon,"I have to admit that the last time I was in Zion was quite some time ago. Since 2000, the par has changed, so that you must take a shuttle through the park, then walk/hike to your destination. The shuttle was enclosed with side windows and skylights, but did nothing to bring the total experience to the visitor. The shuttles should be open air or the park should be open only to hikers. Very disappointing.","September 2, 2011",You miss so much by taking a shuttle,153,"Carlsbad, California",2
Zion's Main Canyon,"We stayed in Mesquite Nevada, a nice small Nev/Utah border town with casinos and all you would want for a home base. We went to Zion 5 times that week as the $25 admission is good for 7 days. We were lucky as we went just before the shuttles started and were able to drive the main canyon in our rental. The views and colors are astounding and you are down in the canyon rather than up on the edge like in Grand Canyon. A river meanders through it and there are many trails to take in the main canyon and all along the drive throught the park. At one point down the road we got out and hiked along the creek to find a huge cat track in the photo below. Luckily the feline was nowhere to be found 'cuz it was large. All of the park is just beautiful and we picked the perfect time as it was not too hot or cold and just somewht crowded but not terribly.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Wow, is all that can describe the Zion National Park in Southern Utah. The NP is where the Rocky Mountains meet the Great Plateu with a wild western landscape and the history of the Anzasi as its backdrop. We travel the country visiting and hiking America's Greatest NF, NRA, NP and NM's, so we are inclined to be excited when we get to stamp another page in our National Parks Service Passport Book. That said the Zion National Park was a double whammy, you are only a couple hours from the Heart of Las Vegas yet you feel a thousands of miles away. The Park has much to see and like its cousin, the Bryce Canyon NP to the east, Zion is unique in that it is dotted with many small ""mini canyons"". The Lodge and Restaurant in Zion is polished and beautiful and don't be suprised to see a fawn and mother grassing at the grass outside your porch, when you wake up in the morning. We really enjoyed the Zion Lodge located right in the heart of the NP and Zion Parkway. The onsite restaurant is open daily, we enjoyed a wine and a creative menu while sitting back and soaking in the stunning hills and falls. Hiking trails dot the area and every road is a scenic. I suggest you start at the Zion visitors center to orient yourself with the Park. The Visitors Center is located in the City of Springdale, the town itself is a great launching spot. With so many stops to refer to, may I suggest Weeping Rock. Hiking Trails are available for all skill and ""desire"" levels, so make sure you find something to hike. Don't bother visiting Zion NP if you are the type that ""Views from the comfort of a car"". That said, this was my second time visiting Zion, the first time we visited was in the spring, everything was green and beautiful. Problem was, one of the main attactions, the Virgin River Gorge was too dangerous to navigate. We could only hike so far and could not walk through the Narrows, due to the flow of the river (spring snow melt). We headed back in the summer to avoid that, but the crowds were horrid and you must leave your car way out at the entrance, unless you have a reservation at the lodge. The Lodge was overbooked, so we could not get one. As a result we were forced to carry our gear with us on the shuttle. The problem is you are with the ""Grand Canyon"" types. They need to offer seperate transportation for hikers, as there is nowhere to put your gear. When we came in the spring the tempeture was much more foregiving and there were no crowds. We were able to drive our car (with gear in tow) through the entire National Park. One last tidbit, if you are coming in from the west (most common) do not forget to drive through the eastern entrance. The winding road out of the valley is stunning and the tunnel is a marvel of engineering (once America's longest). Plus a rare and ""alien"" landscape awaits you on the other side of the tunnel. A clear demonstration of the protection that the tall peaks of the Virgin River Valley has offered from the Nasty High Desert winds and arridness of Southern Utah. Nothing I can write here can fully describe the Zion National Park Area, but rest assured if you are in search of something different just a short day trip from Las Vegas or just need a sense of peace this is where its at.","August 29, 2011","Don't go during the summer, but still awesome!",145,Orlando,5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion was very hot when we were there is mid July. We arrived late on the first evening (around 6pm) and had to take a campground site in the Watchman Campground walk-in section. It was fine, but there was little shade and it was uncomfortably hot. We moved first thing next morning to the South Campground, which was gorgeous. We had a site right on the bank of the river and tucked away from any site traffic. Kids bought a 'tube' in local grocery store and were able to play in the river when we returned from our excursions each day. It was a great way to cool down and have fun too.Junior ranger program was good, they have a great nature centre that was full of interesting information aimed at the 5-12 year olds, nice cool and welcoming building, also a great place to escape the heat!My children (5, 8, 10, 12) absolutely adored Zion.

Zion's Main Canyon,"A trip to Zion National Park is definitely worth your time. It’s truly a breathtaking, magical experience. My wife and I are serious hikers. The trails at Zion are more developed and receive more traffic than other places we’ve visited but this doesn’t detract much from the overall experience. Between Zion and another trip we made to Waterton Lakes Canada, it's tough to pick our favorite hiking trip of all time but we'd probably have to choose Zion because hiking ""The Narrows"" up through the Virgin River is so unlike anything you can experience anywhere else (hiking in the river with 200' canyon walls soaring up on either side of you). Only 20' wide in spots.While in Utah we also visited Bryce Canyon National Park. We liked it a lot too (very different and unique) but not nearly as much as we liked Zion. Bryce is otherworldly, Zion is majestic.Here's a list of our don't miss hikes for Zion. Figure a day for each one: 1. The Narrows - We went in early October which is really the best time to go (lower water levels). Flash flooding is possible at all times of the year but more so in the spring. Lots of people still go in the spring. Be sure to check the flood risk each day at the ranger station before heading out. You can rent the gear you'll need from Zion Adventure Company (dry suit pants, water socks and shoes, walking stick all for $35).2. Observation Point - Highest point in the park. The trail is “mountain paved” most of the way and easy to walk but very steep (lots of switchbacks).3. Angel's Landing - Zion's most famous land trail. Follows a knife-edge ridge up to the top (there are chains to hold onto if you're the nervous type).4. Taylor Creek (North Fork Trail) - Taylor Creek is in Kolob Canyon which has a separate entrance on the far side of the park (30 minute drive). Most people don't bother to make the trip but it's really beautiful. We hiked the North Fork trail. It's very easy to hike without much elevation but really pretty. It ends under a spectacular red rock arch. When you're done hiking the trail be sure not to leave until you drive up to the very top of Kolob Canyon Road (unbelievable view).","August 12, 2011","Unbelievably spectacular, incredibly beautiful!!!",24,"Chicago, IL",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"My husband and I recently visited Utah and stayed in Pinewoods Resort situated half way between Bryce and Zion National Parks. Both parks were breathtaking, but Zion was my favorite. The half-hour drive into the canyon is breathtaking. Then you park and traverse various elevations by shuttle choosing from a variety of trails. We loved the Riverside Walk and enjoyed the water and the shade.This trail is the Gateway to the Narrows and you need to bring water shoes to make it to the end of the two-mile trail to see the waterfall. We also enjoyed a great lunch ""al fresco"" at the Zion Lodge. What an incredible place.","August 11, 2011",Zion was remarkable!,15,"Treasure Island, Florida",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"My husband and I were fortunate to stay in the park at Zion Lodge. Zion Lodge itself is not fancy but is very comfortable. After visiting the nearby town where other lodging is available, I can't stress enough how highly I recommend staying in the park. There is no comparison to walking around Zion at dusk or dawn and seeing the light and shadows on the canyon walls. The juxtaposition of so many beautiful green trees against the red rock is striking but one of the aspects we enjoyed most was the intimate feeling of the park; it's difficult to explain without experiencing it yourself. Hiking is wonderful: one hike that we especially enjoyed was the Watchman Trail and we were the lone hikers!

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion National Park was calm and had a great shuttle system to guide you around to certain stops. The Riverside Walk was great for my family of four (I'm 14 with a 9 year old sister). It was beautiful and my sister loved the animals. The Emerald Pools which we also visited, were a huge disappointment; it was basically water with algae. The Weeping Rock also isn't as lush, beautiful or as flowing as was described, but it was great because it was really quiet. It sounded like rain and it was nice to take a break.  What to bring? Walking shoes, a camera, and lots of water (it's really IMPORTANT). The canyon was beautiful to see from the bottom and you can find some great flowers and small wildlife. It took us about four hours to go through the park, visiting all the sights I mentioned. Without the extra stops, the Riverside Walk takes about 40 min to the end (1 1/2 round-trip) where you can wade in the Virgin River.","August 1, 2011",Zion: Do this and get out!,7,"Danby, Vermont",3
Zion's Main Canyon,"I reserved two sites at Watchmen but when we got there we found out there were still campsites available on first-come-first-serve areas. I was surprised to discover this since we went there during peak season. The kids had a blast swimming in the Virgin River! As for the Angel's Landing, it takes about 1 hr to get up to the top and back. So if you choose wait at Scout's outlook and let other brave souls climb the chain-linked side of the mountain (0.5 mile each way), either be prepared to wait one hour or just go back down the trail. We left from Grotto and the trail to Sout's outlook was mostly steep.","July 30, 2011",Campsites still available,9,"Truckee, California",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"This is a wonderful place - the wow factor coming from Hurricane to Springdale past the first set of mountains and rocks is really something. We stayed at the cliffrose lodge and gardens motel just outside the park entrance but the free shuttle buses operate along the whole of springdale's main street so once you are there the car is no longer needed.The park itself is much more than a 6 mile long narrow canyon - the shuttle bus drivers will tell passengers all about it as they drive and there are stopping off points at regular intervals for the trail heads and the viewpoints. Many of the trails are flat and most of these are either concreted or black top so it is easy from the elderly to get some exercise and see some interesting sights. The first time I went and stayed for only 36 hours which was far too short. Just the main canyon is worth spending a couple of days looking over and then there are the other bits - Lava point in the centre of the national park (road starts in Virgin) is a good half day trip and another one where walkers will enjoy the views, The Mount Carmel road out of the Park is also a wow factor route with some fantastic short walks to spectacular overlooks plus a great assortment of rocks and mesas and then the best bit of all is the Kolob finger canyons overlook road which is at the opposite end of the park to the main canyon and always worth a half day to drive there or perhaps a full day to see the sights and also walk to the double arch cave at the end of Taylors Creek - its a long way but worth it. I still have many things I want to do and see in this place after visiting for 4 or 5 days about 5 times in all. I have been to Yellowstone and Yosemite but this one is my favorite Park for walking and a photographing the scenery. The weather in September is perfect as it does not rain is seldom cloudy and does not get too hot.","July 29, 2011",The wow factor starts before you get there,92,"herts,uk",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"At the top of what for us was a challenging and exciting hike up Hidden Canyon trail my two teenage boys and I shared in the beauty and wonder of the park. This was a mountain top experience. Having seen the Grand Canyon (N. Rim) and Bryce on the same trip we rated Zion as the best although the others are not far behind. The immense scale of the formations are staggering as the scenery changes at every turn through the park. If you can, stay on site. The hotel is very nice with needed comfortable beds. Food at the restaurant is above average and the view on the outdoor deck is worth the price of the meal..","July 28, 2011",Amazing place More than words and pictures can capture,34,"Apex,NC",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"I had heard a lot about The Subway hike located in Zion so I was excited to find out that there were 3 permits left for me and my 2 kids (17 and 21). I tried to get specific information about this hike from the park rangers and Zion Adventure Company, but I only learned that it was about 4 miles or 4-6 hours or so. ""Just follow the stream"". So we set out down a very steep, loose dirt and rocky slope at about 10 a.m. w/some sandwiches and 2 liters of water each. It was rough and my daughter fell into a stickery bush. There was no clear trail along the stream and we rock scrambled and traversed all over the place like fools for hours. We were constantly smacking nats. I felt like this was a bad decision since the going was so rough. I wanted a machete and bulldozer at times. The beauty at the end of the hike with the amazing stepped waterfalls and open lava tube was incredible though. We swam clear to the back and went behind the waterfall. The water was cold but we were in heaven. The hike back was long and difficult. We ran out of water and luckily found another hiker who had iodine tablets. The hike back up the rocky slope nearly did me in. A park ranger on top gave us 4 liters of water and said we were not adequately prepared for that hike...we needed more food and more water. No kidding. It's not a hike that I would do again, but we all feel like we discovered treasure.","July 24, 2011",The Subway Bottom Up is ROUGH,71,California,5
Zion's Main Canyon,"We have been to Grand Canyon, Arches, Bryce, etc and they all are mystic and wonderful but Zion is special because when viewing it you look UP at the canyon. Other canyons you are above them looking down and the perspective at Zion is from below- gives a whole other take on it. When we get off the plane from NC, in Vegas, we go to Walmart and get a cooler, stock it up and roam....Get an annual Park Pass-$80- and you are set to go.I always look forward to this Park.Shuttles are great, park in Springdale, stay in St George(close and lots to do-fairly metropolitan), Dixie Palms is old school basic, there are other places that are clean and cheap with more amenities. Springdale itself is very tourist-y.Take your car through the Park too on the Canyon highway early or later in the day- through the tunnel, going from Springdale, there are Mountain sheep all over....great photos. The Park is very different on this side.Drive through the Park on 9 from Springdale about 2 miles to view a Buffalo farm!!

This is American wonder at its best. There are few places on the planet that could be considered its equal. We drove a couple of hours up from Vegas for the day. It was my second visit to Zion. I was there nine years prior and wanted to return, the images of the rocky cliffs always in my mind when I considered travelling. We drove about in the eco-friendly buses. Of all the natural parks I have visited, I would put Zion right up there with the Grand Canyon and ahead of Niagara Falls. It is a magical, wondrous place you should see at least once in your lifetime. I think I discovered God here and I have been looking for a very long time.","July 16, 2011",God is here,183,New Bedford,5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Simply put, this is the most beautiful national park in the southwest, if not in the whole country. Some of the trails in Zion are easy enough for most children 5-10 years old. Trail conditions can change according to the weather, however, as a friend discovered when she took a stroller on a trail that was easy enough, except that it included long patches of mud.The free shuttles (the only vehicles allowed in most of the park) make the park much more pleasant to visit when it gets crowded in the summer. The shuttles run regularly and give visitors with limited mobility the chance to appreciate many gorgeous views. During winter visits when very few people visit the park, a little bit of snow at high altitudes adds to the beautiful colors.","July 8, 2011",More Beautiful Than The Grand Canyon,42,"Taos Ski Valley, New Mexico",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"We did Zion, Bryce, and the Grand Canyon on this trip and Zion was our favorite (though it was 40 and raining most of our day at Bryce so it probably wasn't a fair comparison). We knew ahead of time that we would not be able to hike the Narrows because of high water so we were disappointed and weren't sure what we were going to do. We were so wrong!! There is so much to see and do and such a variety of scenery. We were hiking under waterfalls and through pools in the morning and up canyon walls in the afternoon. We were lucky enough to see 2 bighorn sheep at sunset one day and there were squirrels and chipmunks everywhere (very used to people so you can go right up to them but DON'T touch or feed them!!). Ponds had millions of tadpoles. There is a free shuttle through the park as well as one that runs through the town of Springdale (very quaint and pretty, don't miss it!). We have already planned a trip back in the Fall to hike the Narrows! Our kids are 9 and 12 and there were lots of hiking options that were great for them but still challenging for us and they loved all the animals.","July 3, 2011",Best part of our trip!,48,"Jacksonville, Florida",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"This must be the best organised national park to visit. Not only are there frequent shuttle buses to get the visitors from their hotels or RV parks to the park entrance, but from there other shuttles make it simple to get to all the trail heads for easy or difficult hiking. Don't be afraid to get out and walk if you can but if you take my advice you will bring a collapsible hiking pole with you, it really helps keep your balance if you are less than nimble and makes hills so much easier. We are in our 60's and not the fittest but in an afternoon and a full day we saw everything that was accessible for us . The scenery is breathtaking but look out for the birds, plants and butterflies, we saw several species we hadn't seen before and got some wonderful pictures.","June 28, 2011",Easy access national park,23,"Tonbridge, United Kingdom",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Heading into Zion I was wondering if I would be disappointed because we had just left Bryce Canyon & I couldn't imagine anything being more spectacular. Glad to say I was wrong. You view this canyon from the bottom looking up & it is fantastic!!The North end of the park is very different from the South end. Both are amazing to see.Lots of hiking available, as usual in our park system. However, the riverside hike at the top of the canyon (Temple of Sinawava) is a must. It is an easy walk & I can't find the words to describe how beautiful this trail is. It is only 1 mile long (2 miles roundtrip). Saw deer at very close range on this hike.You cannot drive your car in the main part of the park - you must use their shuttle. I thought this might be inconvenient, but it is actually easy to use & they come by frequently. You never wait more than 10 minutes for one at any of the stops.Advice: if you want to stay in the park you must make reservations months in advance.Also, this time of year it is best to get to the park early in the morning (no later than 9 am). It gets very hot past lunch time (over 100 degrees). The mornings are very cool and early in the morning it is easy to find parking. Parking is hard to come by, if not impossible, after 10 am.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion National Park is one of the most monumental and valuable Western experiences I have ever had. The scenery is simply spectacular, and there are walks for people from 95 to 2 years old with varying levels of difficulty.Transport to the easily accessible portions of the canyon by the shuttle is a breeze and very convenient. You could easily reserve a camping spol(reservations are strongly recommended) onsite, and spend a week using the shuttle, barely using ones vehicle at all.There are day hikes, half day hikes, and 2 hour hikes, not counting the 'backcountry' hikes for the diehard hikers and backpackers. They even have a backcountry office where you can register your trip(highly recommended, as the canyons can be dangerous) and get valuable advice from experienced rangers.The views are almost always spectacular, and well worth the visit, een for a half day, and especially for a day plus.Lodging-- hard to find and expensive unless you reserve ahead of time. RV campgrounds exist, and cost 40 dollars a night for a TENT site. The national park camping, that which is reservable, is recommended for camping. Hotels are well, even more expensive. If you are a larger family, RV or tent camping will definitely save you a small fortune since they charge by vehicle.Entry price? 25 dollars per vehicle, for a one week pass. Very reasonable considering the exquisite views and places one can access easily.","June 14, 2011",Extraordinary!,6,philadelphia,5

Took the shuttle to last stop and then throughout the day stopped at the seven other stops Had lunch at the Zion Lodge, no lines and saw the video at the last stop.

We woke early (5am) to catch the first shuttle hike the Angels Landing trail. Completed the hike in about 4 hours. We were glad we started early as started to get hot by 10am. What can you say about the hike, it's all uphill there and downhill back. The scenery really opens up when you reach the top of Walters Wiggles which are the switchback that bring you to the top of a hill that allows panoramic views. About 2/3 of the crowd or better ""chickened out"" at Scout Lookout. The last half mile is a hard climb, but take lots of rests and push through you will be glad you did. Quit impressive on top of Angles Landing and in my opinion it's a long hike to quit 1/2 mile short.

It is certainly different from the other 6 parks we visited as you tend to be looking upwards rather that across or down to see the sites. It's green, mountainous with the pleasant Virgin river running though it. It has a brilliant free shuttle service with numerous stopping off points where you can start easy, medium or strenuous hikes. If you have a child's pushchair then they can accommodate this on supports at the front of the bus and even disabled wheelchairs can be run on & off the bus with a special area for storage ((with passenger if needs be). There is even a lodge in the park where you can get food & drink including full meals. We spent 2 & a half days in the park and did four of the easy/medium walks with lots of stops for photos and enjoyed every minute of it. Perhaps the only disappointment was that we couldn't stop to take photos on the Zion-Mt Carmel highway because of the major roadworks that were being undertaken while we were there. It was a shame because there are some brilliant rock formations adjacent to the roadside.","October 17, 2010",Very attractive park with brilliant shuttle service,48,Wirral,4

When we arrived at Cable Mountain Lodge, we were shown to our plush room. Cable Mountain Lodge adjoins the entrance to Zion National Park, and is a 3 minute walk from the visitor's center and the canyon shuttles. No cars allowed in the canyon, and you don't need, or want them! The shuttles leave every few minutes and you can hop off at any of the many stops going up canyon, catching the next shuttle when you ready.The canyon contains hiking trails for all abilities, guided horseback riding and the only restaurant/accomodations inside the park. Dinner at the park restaurant was casual in natural and the variety and quality of the food good. An adequate wine list, too.Our third day included a drive through the rock formations of the other side of the park, continuing on to the Pink Sands State Park.

Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion National Park is incredibly beautiful due to the sheer cliffs and upclose views. The weeping rock was fantastic. Over twenty five trails, ranging from easy to hard, enough for any hiking enthusiast and the casual couch potato. Ranger guided tours are well worth the time. Museum's film was very informative and interesting. If you want to see most of the worthwhile sites, you will need at least two full days. As great as the Grand Canyon (North, West, & South rims) views are, you need to go down to the river on mules or helicopter to see what you can see just walking around Zion. Also, the restaurants & bistros in nearby Springdale give you a better selection and value than the Grand Canyon. It's only a little over 1.5 hrs. from Las Vegas, and you can stay overnight in St. George, UT for very reasonable lodging rates. And while in St. George make reservations for the Tuacahn Amphitheatre, a regional equity theatre with great musicals set against sheer cliffs for incredible acoustics.

We spoke with other folks who came from Springdale on the shuttle and their experience was superb. Some of the trails are challenging. We are hikers from back East.

Well, we just got back from a visit to Zion and this park ranks right up there in my opinion. Yosemite invokes iconic images such as El Capitan and Half Dome ... and those famous pictures by Ansel Adams. Zion doesn't have Ansel Adams to popularize it but it does have the awe inspiring 1000+ ft verticals, sheer drops and picturesque water falls. When you realize that these water falls are occurring in the middle of a high desert, they are even more impressive! Also, unique to Zion are the Narrows, Checkerboard Mesa and Angels Landing.We could only spend one day in Zion. I wish we could have spent longer.

It's just up close and personal - like having front row seats to a show. We went in early August and it was perfect climate. Stay as close to the park or in the park if you can. People who stayed in St George had to drive 45 min each way to get to the park. Thats lots of valuable travel / sightseeing time.

The views were spectacular. We walked back down to Zion Lodge, where we had a nice lunch in the Grill. I highly recommend the gazpacho. We then took the shuttle to the Temple of Sinawava, where we enjoyed another nice hike. Shuttle service throughout the park was a great benefit. Service was excellent at the Lodge grill.

First.... The Temple of Sinewava and walk along the river there, then hike a small but steep trail up to Weeping Rock, you may want to visit the Grotto next, then we have a break for a picnic on the grassed area at the Lodge before doing the Emerald Pools trail across the road.There is a stop for a short walk at the Court of the Patriarchs to just look up at these towering cliffs before heading to the Human History Museum at the last stop before exiting.Finally we spend some time at the Visitors centre before heading out through the lovely town of Springdale.We had 2 days here and there is so much to do it will need another visit.You could however manage most of this in 1 day with an early start.The weather can be a determining factor.It gets really hot in the canyon but we went in spring and it was manageble.We have also done one of the strenuous trails up into the cliffs and it gets a little cooler as you reach the top. Keeping hydrated is the key.It was totally amazing to look down and see people like ants on the canyon floor.What ever the season and light, this park is awesome to see.... a must see on the National Parks list.

Zion's Main Canyon,"The main canyon of the Zion is accessible only by shuttle bus. The area outside the main canyon is scenic aswell, but you need to be expert on climbing and you must possess good orientation skills to visit it. Anyway if you want to have a deep experience in the Zion main canyon, you need at least 3 days or more. Remember that the Angels Landing trail is about 5.5mi round trip. I spent at least 5 hours there and I am young and fit. After that you have no more forces to walk again. The very next day you can visit the Observation Point along a 8mi round trip trail and more or less 6 hours of time. The third day you can visit the Narrows with 9.4mi round trip and 5 hours in the water. Do not forget to check the weather conditions before entering the Narrows since sudden flash floods may happen. In the main canyon you still have the chance to visit the Weeping Rock on a very short trail, the Hidden Canyon on a steep trail beside the Weeping Rock and the Court of Patriarchs without walking.","July 6, 2010",I left my heart in the Zion Canyon,53,ponte a tressa,5

Angels landing hike was great and scary at the top. Much more scary than I anticipated going up. Easy coming down. There were a few slippery and steep parts on the hike where you had to hang on to the chains and lots of people going up and down, but it was worth the effort. It is intimidating to look at from below. Coming down was a breeze.The main canyon was great. I did 3 different hikes. I didn't realize how much there was to see on the east side of the tunnel til I left...sadly I didn't spend enough time there.Camping in the canyon was great. but get there EARLY...like 9am or sooner or it fills up.I spent one night camping outside the park in a hotel site.

We'd love to come back another time to spend longer exploring this beautiful place.","May 9, 2010",Absolutely beautiful,3,UK,5
Zion's Main Canyon,"I am told that bighorn sheep were reintroduced to Zion National Park about 20 years ago. Now, if you are lucky, you can catch a glimpse of them on the east side of the park, like we did. From what I know, they hang out on the east side of the big (1 mile long) tunnel and they are often spotted near the main road (hwy 9) in small groups. If get a chance to watch them going up and down the steep cliffs, you will be amazed. They can run at high speeds along what seems to be very steep places. Quite amazing!There is a picture of one of the large bighorn sheep rams on the front page of this site. I have posted a few other photos with this review. www.dozionnationalpark.com","December 11, 2009",Zion National Park Bighorn Sheep,12,Santa Clara,5
Zion's Main Canyon,There is a serenity to the canyon in Zion. Mountains tower over you and the colors change pepending on the time of day. It's a feeling as much as an attraction.,"November 13, 2009",Peace in the Valley,3,cleveland oh,5
Zion's Main Canyon,"We took a long trip out west and was vitsiting national parks. We actually came upon Zion National Park by accident. We had never heard of it or planned to visit there. We were driving through Utah and the road we were on took us to the gate entrance. The p;ark ranger asked if we would like to enter the park and we decided to. We drove through the tunnel and was totally amazed at the sights we were seeing. If you don't enter by the tunnel, be sure and drive through. It is utterly amazing what you will see! Once inside the park, we were anything but bored. We could have spent much more time there had we planned it. It was our favorite part of the trip. We hope to go back again and stay longer.","November 3, 2009",Zion National Park,9,United States,5
Zion's Main Canyon,"This place is awesome.. Pictures will not show the grandeur of this canyon. The free shuttle takes you through a wonderful tour of the main canyon.. For a complete tour, take an auto tour of the other road and up through the tunnel. It is mile after mile of scenery like you have never seen. I am not prone to exaggeration but Zion National Park is the most beautiful place I have ever seen..","October 20, 2009",one of the most beautiful places on earth,13,MIddle Tennessee,5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Zion N.P. is probably my favorite one in the USA. No, it is not as fantastic as the Grand Canyon or majestic as Yosemite but it is so quietly and understatedly just plain beautiful.Being much less visited than either of those two or Yellowstone, it is also less ""spoiled"" and you can move around much more freely without bumping into other folks. It is a bit out of the way, just as the North Rim of Grand Canyon and Bryce Canyon are, but, take in all three if you can, they are close to each other, none more than a day's drive from Las Vegas.","October 18, 2009",Simply a WONDERFUL Place,15,"Burnet, Texas",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"We spent two days at Zion. The shuttle system is first rate. Shuttles are clean, comfortable and have enough stops to get you to all the various points of interest or trailheads. Park is clean and well marked. We also drove on the Kolob Terrace Road through an area not usually visited. Well worth the drive. Lots of lodging and food choices in town. Don't miss the drive out the eastern side of the park. Very nice area to explore.","October 13, 2009",Zion NP is a class act,4,"Laguna Hills, California",5

Zion's Main Canyon,"I was on a 3-day trip from Vegas with only 2 days and 1 night in Zions. After researching, I knew I wanted to do the Narrows and Angels Landing. September was a wonderful time to see this park, although waiting another couple of weeks would have been even better to experience the color changes in the trees. It was warm, so I thought that renting gear for the river hike would be unnecessary and I was right. I wore my Chaco’s sandals with a hard sole. I was a little worried about not having a stick upon arrival (a ski pole or rented stick would do fine), but as I thought, when I got to the start 1 mile down the river walk hike at the last shuttle stop, people had left tons of sticks that were perfect to use. Unfortunately, I only made it an hour or so up the river on my arrival date as it was getting late/dusk - and I forgot to set my watch up one hour from my drive to Vegas. Too bad... I will do the whole hike another time. The water wasn't cold but refreshing that time of year. Would I have done this on a cooler, overcast day? Probably not. The nice thing about this hike is that there are some very hot days in Zions that limit your hiking to morning or evening. This can be done anytime if you just want to explore for a few hours, but if you intend to hike to Wall Street or further, obviously you need to start early. And you need a permit if you hike beyond 2 miles. No matter how good of a hiker you are, prepare for this to take some time. There are parts of water that reach your waist and there are other parts that have fast moving shallow water around boulders/rocks that you have to maneuver around. The next day, I was much more organized time wise and hit Angel's Landing Hike at the Grotto shuttle stop. I'm an avid hiker, but this was very very challenging. Getting to Scout's Lookout (I think that is what it is called) was a good cardiac workout over switchbacks and a cool respite once you make a canyon. I thought I was done when I got to Scout's only to find a huge mountain/ridge looming in front of me. Some of the hikers laughed and said they were perfectly fine settling on Scout's as the end of their hike. However, it had taken me an hour to get to this point (2 miles in) so I decided to forge the last .5-mile. It took some time, as there are many places where you wouldn't want to be climbing up while someone was climbing down. And the workout wasn't cardio but a definite muscle killer. My thighs hurt for days afterward. But all in all, the end result was worth it. Quite a reward for your effort. And they say; if you are afraid of heights, don't do the last part of this hike. They are absolutely right. One wrong move, and you are over the edge. I'm not afraid of heights but still found myself getting vertigo from time to time. But I highly recommend this hike to anyone that can do it.","October 8, 2009",Beautiful Park - Here are 2 hikes if you can only stay 2 days,69,"Naples, Florida",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"We really enjoyed our visit to Mt. Zion. The free shuttle that runs the park is a great way to see it. Buses run every 5 minutes, so it is easy to hop-on and hop-off as desired. Because of our limited time, we chose to just ride and enjoy the view. The drivers also give some narration, which my parents thoroughly enjoyed. If you are a hiker, this would be a wonderful place to explore - either on the leisurely trails or the more advanced ones that take you along cliff edges.","September 18, 2009",2nd favorite location in Utah - Bryce Canyon #1,89,"Memphis, TN",4
Zion's Main Canyon,"We camped at South cg where its 1st come 1st served. We found perfect spot for 3 days before Labor Day. Most hikes in Zion are very up and down and beautiuful. Must do is entire river hike thru the Virgin River and its banks to The Narrows. Wear old sneakers, no socks,no underwear and nylon shorts.Water can come to your waist. The rocks underfoot can be slippery. I fell 3x but loved the experince... The Narrows and Orderville Canyon are the finale...unless u want to go further... careful of afternoon rain/flooding. Also went to Bryce...that is gorgeous and so unique..must see!!","September 7, 2009",Zion Natiional Park Camping/River Walk,12,"Albuquerque, NM",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"If you like hiking, be sure to rent water booties & walking sticks from an outfitter next to The Spotted Dog Cafe. This allows you to walk up the Narrows which is at the end of the canyon & at the end of the Riverside Walk. We walked 3 hrs up the Virgin River & 3 hrs back & saw incredible views. Less people the further you go up & the narrower it gets. Water level very rarely gets up to your chest.","August 6, 2009",best of the best,43,CA,5
Zion's Main Canyon,"We just got back from Zion and what a wonderful trip it was. We have an 11 and 13 year old and both are in love with Zion. We read many reviews about the Watchman campground before we booked this trip. They were so true and helpful.  We booked our trip 6 months prior to camping. We stayed in site A16 in a tent trailer, a short walk to the river with access and the amphitheater which had interesting nightly Ranger presentations. The weather in June was great. Maybe a light rain or 2 but not a downpour. We spent the first 2 days exploring the campground near the river (lots of tadpoles and little fish) and checking out the wonderful shuttle trip up the canyon. This easy 90 minute round trip shuttle is informative and beautiful (My husband fell asleep it was so relaxing). We hiked the easy weeping rock trail one afternoon which got the kids excited to see what the other longer hikes produced.  We rented canyon water shoes, neoprene socks and a walking stick at Zion Canyon Rentals(under $20.00per person) and ""did the Narrows"" on Thursday. What a wonderful experience for our family. The narrow canyons and river running right down the center (it is the trail) are like nothing I have ever seen or done. We left the visitors center at 10:30am. Arrived at the riverside trail to the Narrows at 11:15 and walked the 1 mile paved path to where it dead ends right into the river. We started our hike through the knee deep water at 11:45am. We hiked up the river to the Orderville Canyon junction (1 1/2 miles) We arrived there at 2:00pm. We played a bit in the very shallow waters of the Orderville Canyon part of the river where two people can stand arms length and touch both sides of the tall canyon walls. At 2:30pm we started the hike back down, arriving at the beginning by 4:30pm. It was a perfect day for our athletic kids and their simi in-shape parents. This is a must do for teenagers. Bring the camera in a couple Ziplocs. The pictures are priceless.  On the last day we headed back to Zion Canyon Rentals for a tube ride down the Virgin River. It was an easy process. We put the tubes in the water right across the street from the rental place. The 1 ½ hour ride down the 2 mile stretch of twisting, shallow river was a blast! My daughter and I went a second time for only $5.00 more. The cost for rentals and pick-up from the let-out spot was only $15.00 per person. Very worth it.","June 14, 2009",Zion Park : A great family trip,12,"San Fernando Valley, Ca.",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"This place was a surprise at the beginning, I didn't know there could be heaven on Earth. This place has changed my life, and I will never forget how beautiful Utah is.

Zion's Main Canyon,"The most surprising fact about people visiting Zion is that over 60% simply drive through, some only taking pictures out the car window! What they are missing is some of the best hiking, climbing, canyoneering and scenery in the world. You can spend years here and still not experience it all. For nature lovers, springtime is the best to view the incredible amount of flowers blooming, some only indigenous to this area. For beginner canyoneers, there are guides and companies that can take you out for the day and teach rapelling in the canyons. A great company is Zion Adventure Company, a very professional, experienced and friendly place to start. Hiking trails can be a few hours or overnighters. Mountain bikers have many trails to choose from moderate to extreme.","June 8, 2009",The most awesome park in the USA.,18,"Springdale, Utah",5
Zion's Main Canyon,"Camped in sites number 21 and 23 after reading a review here on Tripadvisor. The recommendation was great! Those two sites were on the outer loop and the most isolated ones in a full campground. We had a fabulous view of the Watchman himself! The restrooms were a little bit of a walk if you didn't want to traipse across other people sites. Dish-washing was a bit of a hassle -- if you followed the rules -- but all in all, it was well worth it to be surrounded by such grandeur!","April 15, 2009",Watchman Campground,4,South Pasadena,4
