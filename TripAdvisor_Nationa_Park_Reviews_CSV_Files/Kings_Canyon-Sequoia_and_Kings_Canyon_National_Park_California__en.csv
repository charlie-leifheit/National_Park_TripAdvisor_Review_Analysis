Kings Canyon,"My husband and I try each June to visit Kings Canyon National Park for some (gentle) hiking and to enjoy the beauty of the roaring King’s River. We’re never disappointed. This park is a “little Yosemite”. It’s uncrowded, filled with giant Sequoia trees and sheer cliffs. We spend the night in Cedar Grove alongside the river and cook some dinner in the grills provided. Simply beautiful.","October 14, 2019",Our Annual Visit to Peace & Tranquility!,11,"Rancho Palos Verdes, California",5
Kings Canyon,We have been in many national parks. This is not one of the best. We went in the western entrance and saw Grant Grove and the Grant Sequoia. This was excellent! Do not miss it. The rest of the park and the drive to the Canyon was boring as was the Canyon drive. If you want to see a great canyon go to Black Canyon of the Gunnison in Colorado- it is excellent.,"October 11, 2019",Disappointed,106,"henderson, Nv",3
Kings Canyon,Seriously- go up to panoramic point trail after dusk and watch the Milky Way on a clear night. It’s terrifying and amazing all at the same time.

Kings Canyon,"We hadn't hear of Kings Canyon before planning our Californian roadtrip, but so glad we went to visit. It's a stunning part of the world, with endless vista points and a gorgeous landscape. Lots of wildlife - we encountered lots of deer, small furries and birds. Stayed at Cedar Grove Lodge which was quite out of the way, with few facilities nearby but very quiet and relaxing.Lots of fantastic walks, well worth it for a few days (or more if you're interested in venturing into the wilderness).","September 23, 2019",Stunning,61,"Buckinghamshire, England",5

Kings Canyon,"Kings Canyon is a real treasure. It has towering peaks, rushing rivers, lush meadows, and thriving wildlife. It also receives far fewer visitors than nearby Sequoia or Yosemite, making for less stress and no waiting in lines. It's about two hours (85 miles) from either Fresno or Visalia, the nearest decently-sized cities, but it's a very fun drive through winding roads in varied terrain.Once in the canyon, there are several sights that are just off the road, like Roaring River Falls and Zumwalt Meadow. If you have the time and ability, hike to Mist Falls, an 8.1-mile moderately difficult out-and-back route along the Kings River. The falls are really roaring with the extensive snow of the past season, and the views are absolutely gorgeous.Of course, the park is mostly wilderness with few services and various potential hazards, so it's essential to be prepared. The official park website has a lot of great information to help plan a trip, and there are up-to-date conditions and resources at the Cedar Grove Visitors Center as well as the Roads End Permit Station.","July 28, 2019",Gorgeous and peaceful national park,25,"Anaheim, California",5

Kings Canyon,"King’s Canyon is Gorgeous! Water levels are up, so the rivers and waterfalls are jamming! The vista views are amazing in every part of the park. The roads are crazy, as they’re narrow and winding, but totally worth the drive.

Kings Canyon,"Ok winter may not be ideal given road closures and weather, but there are still some great vistas. Technically most of Kings canyon is closed but you can still view a few main attractions on the way in from the west in the national forest area.Sequoia was even more challenging to access from the south with lots of windy roads, weather, and snow/ice build-up. The largest trees in the world are just plain cool. Other hikes would have been great here but alas inaccessible in winter.","March 17, 2019",Great high altitude parks,11,"Buckeye, Arizona",4

Kings Canyon,"Entered at Big Stump entrance after a beautiful drive up, up, up. The first big tree we saw was amazing. Stopped to get pictures. Went to visitor center. Had though we would take a short hike to the General Grant, but ranger said that we should use our time to see the Kings Canyon Scenic Byway (something I really had not considered). Ate lunch at Grant Grove Village, drove to General Grant walk. The trees were beyond what we could have imagined. It is well worth the walk through this area. We had no idea what to expect on the drive on Kngs Canyon Scenic Byway, but set off. No restrooms or water until bottom, so be prepared. It was one of the best drives I have ever been on-awe inspiring- although, I must admit, a little nerve racking for me. My husband drove, but I am not sure that I would have wanted to drive it myself. A plus though, with him driving, I could take in every view. It was very clear and sunny the day we went which made it picture perfect. The road is winding and on the edge of a cliff most of the time (with little in the way of guide rails (if they are there, they are small rocks). There are pull-offs along the way. At the bottom is a couple of small waterfalls, granite cliffs, more beautiful scenery. The falls are Grizzly Falls, very tall, but not a lot of water, but pretty and Roaring River Falls, shooting out of granite. It is a short, nice walk to Roaring River Falls. It was welcome after driving. They are after the Cedar Grove visitor center.The road ends not long after Roaring River Falls, so you need to go back the same way you came (the whole way back up). We had stopped at the Cedar Grove visitor center, not much there, and at the Cedar Grove shop for water etc. After coming back out of the canyon, we stopped at Grant Grove Village before heading to Wuksachi Lodge in Sequoia via the Generals Highway. Takes 45 minutes or more but it is like driving through a painting. You will pass a restaurant along the way to Wuksachi (it is actually not on park land), but we didn't stop there, probably should have, because we were a little late for our dinner reservation at Wuksachi and were delayed in eating.","January 8, 2019",Spectacular views on Kings Canyon Scenic Byway,13,Pennsylvania,5

Kings Canyon,The Kings Canyon drive from Sequoia national Park is really nice with great views. The only thing is that 35 odd mile drive can feel like 80 miles due to many winding up/down route with speed limit around 35 or so. if driving on such kind route is your thing then I would advice you to do it. ,"December 28, 2018",Great views with nice drive,3,"San Diego, California",4

Kings Canyon,"We spent three days in Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks in our Grand Sport Corvette. The roads and sights were made to travel this way! From the road leading into the park (from Fresno), all the way to the end of the road in Kings Canyon, along the King River, it was spectacular. Be sure to pull over at the top and look down into the canyon on the way back out----HOO-HAH!! Those Sequoia trees are amazing in Sequoia National Park, but there was some road construction on the way out (toward Visalia). We really enjoyed our three days here.","November 7, 2018",Wow!,13,Sacramento,5
Kings Canyon,"We visited the park in early October 2018. For those that don't know, there are two parts to Kings Canyon National Park. Grants Grove is the original park, and covers the area surrounding the giant sequoia groves around Grants Grove. It's quite small considering the later addition to the park which is huge - lying to the east up to the high Sierras. I remember this area for the role played in Los Angeles' constant search for water, controversially wanting to dam the Kings River as a water source, as late as the mid-60s. There were not a lot of crowds when we visited. Being relatively empty made it easy to stop a lot, enjoy the vistas, fresh air and take lots of photographs. It's a long downhill and windy (curvy) drive from Grants Grove, losing about 2500-3000 ft of elevation, parts of which are stunningly beautiful. At the bottom of the hill, the highway passes dramatically through a narrow gorge, the roadway cut right out of the cliff. Closely following the South Fork of the Kings River brings one to the Park's entrance. From there it's about a 10-15 minute drive to Road's End where one either begins a hiking adventure into the Sierras or turns around to head back. Along the way dramatic, glaciated cliffs rise on both sides of the valley, waterfalls, river views, campgrounds, picnic areas. We had lunch at the cafe/gift shop/store/lodge. Good burger.","November 6, 2018","Worth the trip, at least once",11,"Bothell, Washington",4
Kings Canyon,"I am currently touring through Washington, Oregon, and California visiting all of the National Parks. Sequoia NP had road construction, but every two hours the crew would open the road and let visitors pass through from one area of the park to the next. A minor inconvenience, but understandable and acceptable. Then I get up to Kings Canyon and find that the only road to the actual canyon was completely shut down and did not have any provisions for allowing park visitors to reach the actual canyon. Obviously, this was not acceptable. You just can’t close the road down and prevent visitors from seeing the canyon. People come from all over the World to see places like this, so a complete road closure is the absolute dumbest idea ever. One could understand if the road was temporarily closed due to snow, wildfire, or some other natural cause. But this was a permanent close with no idea when the project would be completed and the road would be re-opened. Of course, CalTrans blamed the NPS and the NPS blamed CalTrans. We all own the road equally as US taxpayers and US Citizens, but neither CalTrans nor the NPS liked my idea of parking across the roadway to block it myself and preventing CalTrans and NPS workers from going back and forth to their desired destinations. Another example of Government ineptitude where they just don’t care about the public / people who they are supposed to serve. I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars on this once in a lifetime trip and have driven thousands and thousands of miles to get here, and Kings Canyon is the only one of my bucket list items that I will not be able to cross off of my list as a result of NPS / CalTrans terrible project planning.

The road to drive down to the main area is super curvy and either fun or nerve racking, but supplies fantastic views. ","October 15, 2018",Fantastic Views,2,,5
Kings Canyon,"Kings Canyon has some of the best all around scenery from Giant Sequoia Trees, marble and granite mountain sides to beautiful streams and meadows. Very quiet in the fall compared to Sequoia to the South or Yosemite to the North. We encountered very few hikers and no road traffic driving to Cedar Grove area. Panoramic Point Trail is a real treat and a super easy hike. General Grant area is awesome and you will see large Sequoia trees without alot of crowds. Big Stump is one of my favorite hikes especially if you have kids that like to climb trees. I highly recommend this area for a quiet and beautiful getaway. Food is higher priced in the small store so plan ob bringing your own for sandwiches etc unless you plan on eating at only restaurant for around $10-$15 per meal.","October 10, 2018",Kings Canyon Early October,1,"Missouri City, Missouri",5

Kings Canyon,My husband and I visited in early October and were very impressed with the breathtaking beauty of the park from the high peaks to the valley below. We made a point to stop at many of the pull offs and look around with binoculars to observe the birds and the distant views. The weather was variable with clouds blocking the view at some of the higher elevations and sun shining through in different parts of the journey. We particularly liked to see the giant Sequoia trees at Grants Grove and the walk through the grove was invigorating after the drive from Fresno. The park was not crowded at all during our visit.,"October 7, 2018",Fantastic!,57,"North Andover, Massachusetts",5

Kings Canyon,We visited Kings Canyon in September and the weather was perfect and there were no crowds. The Sequoia Grove is every bit as nice as Sequoia NP (which is also spectacular) and much less less crowded. It is a beautiful Park with lots of trails and viewpoints. Our whole family enjoyed our 2 days in the park. ,"September 28, 2018",Breathtaking experience! Not crowded at all.,255,New Jersey,5
Kings Canyon,We only had a day to see the parks and it’s well worth doing by car if you don’t have time for hikes. King’s Canyon is incredible whilst the General’s Highway is a wonderful and varied drive. We stopped at the must sees and had a wonderful day - just one comment on the bends as you leave Sequoia to the south. There are a number of S bends but you really don’t need travel sickness pills unless you’re already taking them. Don’t be put off a wonderful drive by comments on travel sickness,"September 26, 2018",Beautiful scenic drive,99,"Suffolk, United Kingdom",5
Kings Canyon,Had planned to hike this trail for a few months however I had to wait for the smoke from the fires to clear. I am so glad I did wait. Mid September is when the backcountry is closing up and there are few people in the park. It was wonderful to experience. Had an up close and personal experience with a bear which was exciting. Grizzly Falls we’re okay but the Mist Falls were so much better if you can hike to them.,"September 22, 2018",Great hike of Mist Trail,186,"San Luis Obispo, California",5
Kings Canyon,There are spectacular views going into this park but wait to use the pull offs until you are leaving because they are usually on the left hand side going in and around sharp turns. A nice drive for high clearance vehicles is to go to nearly the end of the road and take the dirt road out on the north side of the Kings River. It is not marked but looks like a camp site that has a road following the River just after you cross the bridge. You can find fishing holes and remote picnic spots.,"September 17, 2018",You don't have to get off the road to enjoy this park,34,"Erlanger, Kentucky",5

Kings Canyon,"As I was driving through Sequoia national park and came near the grant's tree, it all seemed very familiar. I had been there almost 12 years ago. But I had never been to Kings Canyon. It can be easily missed. The directions and the locations are not as clear as its in Yosemite. But all the splendor is right there waiting to be taken in. Even on labor day weekend of 90 F temps, there were hardly many people. The King's river water was perfect temperature for us to wade in with Shorts and not worry about the freezing temps of Yosemite rivers. But one thing this place lacks is food. Between 30 miles there are only two locations for eating and one at each end which close at 9 PM. I wish we had packed more food with us. ","September 5, 2018",A typical hidden gem of a park,3,,4
Kings Canyon,"Okay, so it's not quite Yosemite Valley because it's lacking the towering waterfalls, but the mountains above you are equally stunning. The canyon has a stunning river flowing though it that I must have taken 250 pictures of. We arrived in the late afternoon, so we did not get to hike nearly as much as I wanted to, but the late afternoon sun made for excellent pictures. The drive in and out is outstanding.

Kings Canyon,There is no doubt that Kings Canyon is beautiful but you need to drive and drive to get there especially if you’re coming from outside the park. It’s only really worth coming here if you’re going to get out into the wilderness and experience it properly - otherwise it’s a driving day with the views experienced from the car window. Stick to neighbouring Sequoia which gives a much better return for your time spent driving if you desire a decent hike.,"August 20, 2018",A hikers paradise that requires a lot of driving to get there,58,wirral,3
Kings Canyon,"We visited Kings Canyon after spending a very long day in Sequoia - I wasn't sure we'd need more time in that part of the Sierras (the air was awful from the fires). I am so glad we took the time to drive into Kings Canyon! The river is beautiful, the rock cliffs are inspiring, and the environment is pretty different from the sequoia forests. The road into Cedar Grove is long and winding - its a blast in a regular passenger car!

Kings Canyon,"King’s Canyon is an amazing Park! I had mentioned our trip earlier in the year to several people I know who live in Southern California - all commented that it is a great place to camp and many go there annually. Based on our visit, I would agree but I also think it must be a best kept secret...SEKI- as it is called - is an incredibly beautiful piece of natural habitat carefully preserved and managed. It is home to the Giant Sequoia trees on earth, many of which are thousands of years old. The park is the only place in the world where these amazing trees can grow and live. There are two trees to note - the General Grant and the General Sherman - the number 1 and 2 tallest trees in the world. There are many amazing trees throughout the park but these two stand out for size and history - 3200+ years old. We also toured the Crystal Cave which is the only cave of the 300+ in the park open to the public for tours. Amazing attraction! We did he family tour which was good for us, but there are more in depth options for true cavers. I highly recommend! Please don’t pass up the chance to see the natural wonders of the Giant Sequoia trees!","August 18, 2018","Oh, Wow!!! ",30,"Baltimore, Maryland",5
Kings Canyon,"Kings Canyon is not as well known or visited as many other National Parks in this country which makes it even more intriguing! We combined this visit along with Sequoia National Park, because on a map you see they are connected. Northern Sequoia and Kings meet. But, visit as separate because they both deserve the honor and attention on their own. There are Sequoia trees in Kings Canyon at the entrance. Grants grove is the highlight until you drive the 32 mile ONE WAY road deep into the canyon. The HUGE slabs of granite on either side of the road is beyond description. There are websites which liken this area close to the dynamics of Yosemite without the summer crowds. Campgrounds are available for extended stays. The park is isolated, so bring supplies because you will not find much. A small visitor center provides the essentials and expensive. The park is known for active bear and signs post this. A long day trip will make you feel satisfied that you did something on the wild side. Not for the very young.","August 14, 2018",A Ride Through Paradise!,44,"New York City, New York",4
Kings Canyon,"We had the chance to spend two days in this park earlier this month, and it was a great visit. The General Grant Grove was a good introduction, but the drive up the canyon is the real highlight. The first few miles are a pleasant drive in the mountains, and then after one of the turns the canyon opens up in front of you. The next miles are a series of turns as you descend a few thousand feet to the river at the bottom of the canyon. The views into the canyon, and at the mountains and granite faces around the canyon are amazing. Take your time, not just for safety but to take in the stops and views.Although not a huge falls, Grizzly Falls is a nice stop and very easily accessible. Take the time to hike around Zumwalt Meadow near the end of the road past Cedar Grove. The hike along the river gives you nice views of the meadow, and great chances to look at the sheer cliffs surrounding this area. We were here in early August and still water on some of the falls, can only imagine what it is like earlier in the year when the flow of water is that much greater!","August 12, 2018",Amazing location - rivals Yosemite and many fewer people,28,"Germantown, Maryland",5
Kings Canyon,I loved it there. We stayed at the lodge for 2 nights. We did a lot of hiking. It was a bit crowded on the weekend. There were a lot of campers at the camp grounds. and the popular trails had a decent amount of people on them. During the week the place cleared out and it was awesome!

Kings Canyon,"The Giant Trees in General Grant Grove are a great opening act. Unlike the Mariposa Grove in Yosemite, where the trees have to be fenced off due to the sheet volume of visitors, you can walk right up to several of the Giant Sequoia's. The parking lot is right next to the trail (bathrooms are there) and the trail is relatively flat compared to the surrounding terrain.If you have time, you definitely should drive the 26 miles to the road's end in Kings Canyon. You will see great rock walls, waterfalls, great overlooks and eventually wind down to the river, which you will follow for the remainder of the view. The drive and the views are spectacular.

Kings Canyon,Kings Canyon sits between Yosemite and Sequoia National parks and is kind of secondary to both. But if you are in the are don't miss out on this one. The diversity of the area's in the park and the scenery makes this a must do. We have traveled to over 26 National parks to date and this is one of the Hidden Gems of the park system. Between the Sequoia Groves when you first come into the park to caves and the Canyon below there is so much to see and do. With multiple hikes from easy short walks to Grizzly falls to more hikes like Zumwalt Meadows there is something for everyone. We unfortunately only got to spend one day here but I wish we could have done at least one more. There is so much to see and do in the area that you need at least two days to do it all.

The views along the drive in the actual canyon are magnificent. Great spots for day (or extended) hiking, especially toward the end of the road. We were there just after Labor Day, so the crowds were gone but the weather was still nice. Unfortunately, smoke from distant CA fires hazed the views somewhat.

Traveler Tip: In order to get to the main site, you must drive on a road that I would recommend doing during the daytime. The edges are steep and would hate to see what would happen if a car drove went over the edge. Please drive carefully.Driving/Passenger Tip: If you get motion/car sick, you may want to take a pill before getting in the car. Once you arrive, the grounds are well kept and clean. The camping community is a friendly group as long as you respect others, the land, and the animals. Overall, I would go back again and again.

One couple finally directed us to short path that leads to a large rock in the river, and there it was! It is actually a beautiful and peaceful site with a lovely view.

This road is less traveled than others in the park.

Kings Canyon,"If Yosemite is too crowded, consider checking out this place. The drive down the canyon is breathtaking, and the views of the granite walls surrounding you. Although this area has some damage from the drought and a big fire a couple of years ago, there's still plenty of trees for shade in areas. Hiking up to Mist Falls as a day hike from Road's End should not be missed. Other cool places to check out are Muir Rock (good place for an icy swim and beach picnic), the hike between Zumwalt Meadow and Roaring Falls, and the view from the back of Knapp's Cabin. If you're planning to stay in Cedar Grove I strongly recommend that you make sure you have enough gas in your car to get out, as there are NO gas stations down there, and the closest in the park is at Hume Lake, which I heard runs out (the only other pumps that existed were at the King's Canyon Lodge, which was destroyed in the aforementioned fire). Best fill up in Dunlap or Squaw Valley outside the park. If you're coming in after Labor Day be advised to reserve campground space, as campgrounds like Moraine start to shut down around then.Also be aware there is also no cell coverage, nor any WiFi (unless you're a guest at the Cedar Grove Lodge). However, if its your goal to unplug and enjoy nature, that shouldn't be a problem.","September 17, 2017",Yosemite's Quietly Awesome Sister,44,"San Francisco, California",4

From there, you follow the cascading river with gorgeous scenes at every pullout. Eventually you reach the valley floor with campgrounds and trail heads in grassy meadows.

Kings Canyon,"I haven't gone camping in several years, so this was a ""re introduction"" into doing this. We got there on a Sunday, and left on Thursday morning. Stayed at the Sentinel campground, which offers the right mix of basic conveniences (bathrooms, ranger station, fire pit and food storage), while also being quiet and relaxed (not overcrowded, which is great). The stream is close by. Went hiking on trails from River's End and another trail (can't remember name), both are easy terrain, and around 5 miles, with amazing views of the mountains, water, forests etc. Also did stargazing about 10 miles from Sentinel campground (headed about 10 miles away, in the direction of park exit). You may never get this view of the stars almost anywhere else, outside of other campsites and isolated areas, so it's very worthwhile. If you focus, can see Milky Way and others. Overall, can't recommend this place enough. National parks are something that more people, Americans and visitors alike, should take advantage of.","August 27, 2017",Amazing!,9,,5
Kings Canyon,"It seems like most people limit their visit to Kings Canyon to the Sequoia grove close to the park entrance. They are missing out on a the best the park has to offer. Driving on over the hill, along the river to the end of the road provides access to beautiful scenery, great waterfalls and lot's of fantastic picnic spots. Even if you are not into hiking, access direct from the parking lots is easy. And there are no crowds!

Kings Canyon,"Oh Kings Canyon National Park, you simply don't get the press and fame as neighboring Sequoia National Park just down the road, and for that I'm selfishly thankful. This park has managed to retain that off-the-beaten-path feel and sense of ""getting away from it all"" that can unfortunately be lost in busier parks. There's little, if any, commercialization here; not to say that there aren't amenities. The King's Canyon Visitor Center houses a wealth of information on the trails and the park's natural history, and there's excellent campgrounds (Sunset is our favorite), cafes, and a general store as well (look for Double Nut Brown Ale by Mammoth Brewing Company, a local favorite).Perhaps the secret to this park's appeal is in its founding; the park was intended to force the visitor to get out of their car and onto a trail in order to reach the best parts of the park. Personally, I love this aspect of the park, with its lack of roads but abundance of excellent trails including the John Muir Trail that follows the same footpath through the Sierra Nevada Mountains as the Pacific Crest Trail. Whether you want to visit staple sites like Grant Grove or Hume Lake, or simply want to step out and hike the first trail you run across, this park is an excellent alternative to nearby Sequoia if you want to reconnect with Mother Nature without the distractions of shuttles, crowds, and tourists. You always have the option of staying here in Kings Canyon and traveling down to Sequoia on weekdays when its not as busy, the earlier the better.","August 26, 2017","Less visited, and that's why I love it!",43,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5

Kings Canyon,"Each grandchild chooses a national park in their ninth year to visit with us. Our youngest grandson wanted to visit California, so he chose Sequoia and adjacent Kings Canyon. Since Yosemite is so close and so noted, we also worked it in. Honestly, we'd never heard of Kings Canyon before, but it became our hands-down favorite of the trip!Sequoia boasts groves of majestic redwoods and sequoia at 7000' avg elevation, but we didn't realize the General Grant tree is actually in Kings Canyon! As map shows, the two national parks and Sequoia National Forest sprawl over the area to the point you traverse between them all! From Fresno, Hwy 180 climbs to the northern S-KC entrance at Big Stump and is actually in Kings Canyon. Turn right on the ""Generals Highway"" for KC-to-Sequoia-to-Three-Rivers south entrance. Turn left to continue on Hwy 180 as ""Kings Canyon Scenic Byway"" to ""Roads End"" only 4 or 5 miles beyond Cedar Grove Village. We spent four nights in Kings Canyon at Cedar Geove Lodge on the crazy-wild King River. The drive to/from Big Stump entrance or Grant Grove is about 50 minutes (30 miles, slow & winding). It's especially spectacular early morning or early evening. Colors of the granite cliffs change before your eyes, and pullouts offer breathtaking views (plus a breather from eyes-on-the-road.) Kings Canyon is 8000' deep...the Grand Canyon is only a mile deep!Though the road is narrow and curving, it wasn't at all crowded at the height of summer season. No bumper-to-bumper like Yosemite, but some do tend to speed up and round corners too fast...stay alert! Elevation drops to about 4500' at riverside level, and the scenery is indescribable.Yes, it's a fairly long drive, but there's backcountry access, day hiking, horseback riding, plenty of campground space and a 16-room lodge, plus ranger station, store & grille. And no crowds!If you don't want to spend the night, this is a fabulous day outing! Enjoy the ride in, and stretch your legs at Cedar Grove lodge (maybe a picnic at a river-side table or burgers from the grille). From here, plan a day hike or stop to visit four very accessible spots we enjoyed. Another mile or two brings you to Knapps Cabin on the left, a historic outfitter log building with a lovely view. Next is Roaring River Falls on the right - 1/4 mile and wheelchair accessible! Continue to Roads End to stroll on the Zumwalt Meadow boardwalk path. A hundred yards or so from the permit station is Muir Rock where you can stand atop and gaze at the canyon and river where the famous naturalist gave many a speech on why it should be preserved for our pleasure!","August 13, 2017",Magnificent!...and a new NP favorite!,84,"Waco, Texas",5

Kings Canyon,Came to see Kings Canyon NP and to take in its beauty. The General Grant tree and surrounding area is beautiful. We also drove to Grizzly Falls (technically not in the park) and enjoyed the coolness caused by the snow melt.

We love American and Canadian national parks in general and have visited, camped in some when we were younger, and hiked most of them. But we had never been to Kings Canyon and Sequoia. They were not affected by the forest fires burning at the time except for some distant haze on one side. And so much less crowded than Yosemite, which sounded like a nightmare in July, 2017. We enjoyed the Kings Canyon section even more than Sequoia. Big trees are great. Kings Canyon has some. But the canyon is really scenic and the river was beautiful in its fierce flow. Nice hikes and beautiful, varied scenery and views at various elevations. Mountains, rivers, meadows, trees, rock formations, waterfalls.

Kings Canyon,"Kings Canyon is a great day trip or the leaping off point for probing deep into the Sierra Nevadas. To reach the canyon you drive about 30 miles - but it takes nearly an hour from the Grant's Grove area of the park. The road twists and turns as it snakes its way to the valley floor with awesome views all the way down. The road is not for the faint of heart. Make sure you are not too scared to drive it and if you are really shaky be sure to use the pull offs to let others by. Once you finally reach the valley floor you drive along the edge of the Kings River, which was roaring in full throat in June of 2017 when we visited due to the massive snow melt from the previous winter.Lots to do in the valley, but the highlights I would say are 1) the river and valley themselves with stunning views everywhere, 2) Grizzly Falls just outside the National Park in the National Forest, 3) Roaring river falls, 4) Zumwalt Meadow, 5) Roads end, and 6) Cedar Grove. We did all these sites in a short day before heading out of the valley and driving up to Yosemite for the next leg of our vacation. If you plan no longer hikes then devoting a day to Kings Canyon seems like a good balance.","July 24, 2017",King of Canyons - Deeper than the Grand Canyon,164,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",5
Kings Canyon,"Our day and a half in Kings Canyon was amazing - and too short. It is stunningly beautiful with many things to do, we only scratched the surface. We started, of course, at Grant Grove and traveled through Sequoia National Forest on 180 for awhile before re-entering the National Park near the bottom of the canyon. Along Route 180 while in the National Forest, we decided to make a few side trips. Our first choice was the Boole Tree Loop Trail, but the Forest Road entrance was blocked - so we could not go there. We back-tracked a short distance and headed toward Chicago Stump. The Forest Road was rough and bumpy, but we had an AWD SUV so enjoyed the off-road driving and the scenery. At Chicago Stump there is a small parking area and signs so you know when you arrive that you are in the right location. It is a short 1/4 mile walk to the stump from the parking area - and what a stump! It is spectacular to see and incredibly emotional to stand beside this massive stump. It exists as a stump instead of as a beautiful tree all because of money & greed. There are signs posted around the viewing area telling the history of what was once the General Noble Tree. This was an excellent stop - one few people experience. We returned to 180 East toward the canyon, and decided to turn right toward Hume Lake for milkshakes. The drive down to the lake is steep and windy. At the bottom, we stopped at the Hume Lake Day Use Area, and sat by the lake on benches, watching boats and swimmers. Our children swam for a little while. We could see a sandy beach area across the lake and decided to drive to it, guessing the milkshakes would be in that direction. But, once there, our car was surrounded by Camp children. They were everywhere, hundreds of them, including crossing and walking in the road so that we felt we were somewhere we were not supposed to be. We saw the general store where the milkshakes are sold, but did not stop because the camp children were everywhere in the parking lot - it seemed as though we were trespassing on 'camp property.' In fact, the way the signage is positioned and reads when passing through that area, we felt no longer like park visitors on park land, but instead like intruders on privately owned camp property. Otherwise, why would hundreds of children be running around in the road with seemingly no adult supervision? So - we did not stop for milkshakes, or at the sandy beach area (which may or may not be allowed - I'm uncertain). Hume Lake was still a beautiful stop, and we enjoyed our time at the Day Use Area, and I'm envious of those camp children. Lucky kids! We drove back up the windy Hume Lake Road to 180, and continued east. There is one defining bend on 180, when we drove around and saw the expansive canyon open up for the first time, and everyone in our car said some form of 'WOW!' Coming down out of the forest to a view of such magnitude is breathtaking. It seems impossible to grow tired of looking around in all directions and feeling so small in this cathedral. The Kings River below was raging white rapids - incredibly powerful. We made our way down to the Cedar Grove Visitors Center to speak with the Ranger about trail closings due to flooding. She gave us 2 great suggestions for our family with two children (9 & 11). We had wanted to hike the Zumwalt Meadow Loop but much of it was flooded in mid-June. We checked into the Cedar Grove Lodge (which I'll review separately) then we headed to the parking lot for Zumwalt Meadow, and took the River Trail to Roaring River Falls instead of the meadow loop. This was a great trail - about 1.5 miles to Roaring River Falls, then 1.5 miles back to the parking lot. As its name implies, it follows the river, sometimes closely, sometimes not. The trail varies from rocky to smooth. The destination was fantastic with all the snow melt, the falls were definitely roaring. We were hoping to see wildlife - and did - a snake! Not my first choice. After our hike, we enjoyed dinner on the outside deck of Cedar Grove Lodge. The next morning, following the Ranger's second suggestion, we drove to the trail head of the Don Cecil Trail. We took this trail only as far as Sheeps Cascade Crossing, which is 1 mile each way, with about 600 feet elevation change to reach the Cascade. It was a hot day, but we started early and enjoyed the cool forest next to the cascade and from the bridge. The descent back down the 600 feet was filled with fabulous views of the canyon. After our morning hike, we drove to the Roads End Permit Station so my husband could relive his Rae Lakes Loop Hike he did 10 years ago :) and spoke with the Ranger for a while. On our way there, a huge black bear ran across the road in front of us, too fast to take a picture. It was amazing! We made one last stop at Cedar Grove for water and snacks from the store, to connect to WiFi in order to get directions to our next destination (Santa Cruz), use the restrooms, and delay our departure from this remote, wild, and beautiful area. (have I said its beautiful enough yet?) We stopped a couple of more times on our way out to snap photos.

Kings Canyon,"After my conference ended Saturday afternoon I drove East out of Clovis to King's Canyon, leaving at 2:30 pm. I arrived at the King's Canyon entrance at 4pm, having stopped about 20-30 minutes along the way to take pictures. As you head East out of the central valley, at first, the terrain is completely barren, no trees or other growth, except for a few groves fed by the King's river. However, by the time you are at 2,000 ft. there are quite a few trees. At King's Canyon, many many twists and turns up the road at 6,500 ft. you are in a forest.I only had an hour before having to return - enough time to visit the General Grant grove and see the General Grant tree, the second largest tree by volume, but the world's largest diameter tree. It's about 1600 years old, 268 ft. tall, 108 ft in circumference at the base. The branches don't start until you are up at about 180 ft. above the ground. In the pictures, you can see how huge the tree is compared to the people at it's base. Also pictured are the roughly 10 other large trees in the Grant grove.If you have time, go to the much larger grove surrounding the General Sherman tree. It is about an hour's drive from the Grant Grove. The General Sherman is a little taller than the Grant, and estimated to be about 2600 years old.It's fascinating how the upslope winds create just the right climate for these giant trees - between 5,000 and 7,000 feet, bringing regular rain at 40+ inches a year (and higher rain and snow amounts higher up), when the central valley only 60 miles to the West, only gets rain in the monsoon season and only about 10-15 inches a year.It's always magical going up into the mountains. Here too. Make time to explore if you can. It's worth at least a full day to drive to the main natural attractions and get a hike in.On the way up the roads have no guard rails and the drop off is 2,000 feet or more. But, fortunately, for the more cautious drivers (me) there are pull offs every mile or so to let the faster drivers pass. On the way down, the mountain side is almost always on your right, so you can go much faster.","June 28, 2017","An hour East of Freno, giant sequoia forrest at 6500 ft.",43,"York, Pennsylvania",4

Kings Canyon,We had a beautiful long weekend (may 29 2017) in Kings Canyon national park. We camped at Stone creek camp ground (next to Sentinel camp ground). The drive to this camp ground is amazing with excellent scenic views . It is simply amazing to drive along the Kings river stream. Our camp site was one of the best that I have camped at. On day 1 we just relaxed. We had hard time coordinating as their is no network at all in this park. We used message boards at visitor center and camp grounds to co ordinate information about out site since we were looking for first cum first serve with folks arriving at different times. On day 2 we did a mist fall hike ( 9.3 mile round trip). This is really beautiful hike ( 2 mile flat and 2.7 mile with 600 ft elevation) This was not in our plan but we ended up doing it and it was simply mind blowing. We ended up going little further as the mist fall board is not clearly visible or we were busy watching the beauty and missed it but if you just walk for about .5 miles further you will get best views of water fall and a scenic snow covered mountains behind it. We were sitting and watching it for like 30-45 mins and didn't feel like going back. . And since our experience was so nice I thought of sharing it on tripadvisor. We are beginners in hiking so after 10 mile hike we were very tired so took a shower and recharged ourselves for BBQ at night.

We also did Kings Canyon Scenic Drive and Zumwalt Meadow (a must due to a very scenic drive). The snow melt was in full force and the streams and waterfalls were going full force. Be sure to stop at Grizzly Falls. There was a bit of a super bloom going on as well. The hike at Zumwalt Meadow was better than average as it was so scenic. It's a easy hike.

I only got to see the general grant tree because there was so much snow on the ground. The hiking trails were compact but I didn't bring the right shoes.

Eventually the picturesque road runs along the river to Cedar Grove past Grisly Falls and Roaring River Falls and crossing Roaring River. Reaching the end of the road is slightly strange - especially knowing that beyond, across the mountains is Death Valley. It was well worth the drive even knowing we would have to retrace the same route.

Kings Canyon,"Was in the area so decided to take a short driving tour of these 2 parks to get a sense of it and come back later for a deeper dive.I found entering the parks via the Kings Canyon entrance, (Northern entrance nearer Fresno) and then driving out via the southern entrance by Three Rivers/Visalia is probably the easier route as parts of the General Highway has massive switchbacks for about 12 miles - going downhill (from 7000+ ft (near the G Sherman tree) to maybe 2000+ ft,(a few miles before the southern gate) before the switch back ends). Going the reverse direction means going uphill on the switchbacks.Signage could be improved upon in the parks - compared to a more popular park like Yosemite, not as clear. $30/car for a week's pass seems high, but I d not begrudge the National Parks the money! Given my short amount of time in the park, I did very little intensive hiking, but merely stopped at the recommended stops. I found these 2 parks to be very serene especially on a beautiful fall day in Nov when there was hardly anyone around - the short walks to the various sights were very nice, and I could see how longer hikes would be great. However, I am a bit puzzled that at this elevation and cool temp (it was in the 50's) at some places, there were lots of bugs swarming around - not very comfortable - not sure if in the summer it gets worse!Overall, doable for a day trip but the journey into the parks especially Sequioa National (from Southern entrance) is a bit of a drive. I would like to return for a longer hiking trip in the future - it's so pretty out here and a lot more isolated than Yosemite.","November 4, 2016",Beautiful and serene place,224,"San Jose, California",4

Kings Canyon,"As a middle age camping family, this trip was probably one of the worst. National Park Service, Rangers, systems are all very old even with young staff. 90% of the General Hwy is very windy, highly do not recommend seniors or poor drivers for the small lane, attractions are far away from one another on the dangerous road. Like previous reviews, the Crystal Cave is a hassle to book and travel to. We showed up at 11:30AM and tickets only available for 3:00PM which on our trip was on a cloudy & sprinkling day. Tickets can ONLY be purchased day of in person. We traveled 1 hrs back the next day before the museum opened at 8:45AM, sorry but only the 12:00pm tour is available. There is NO SIGNAGE of price of tour times just a gift shop staff stating all the rules to each family that inquired. Can you please get corporate and print tour times (there's only 5) and put up sign which were sold out. People can read and get the info...even the foreigners. The 5days of lodging at 3-places in the park were all very ackward in their locations. Tent camping at Grant Grove was reserved on a poor website, lacked lots of info, lugging our ice-chest, frozen meats, supplies to the camp from parking was the farthests I've ever experienced about 70 feet away...unlike most camping, the $260 Wachiachi Lodge was no difference, had to drive from lobby to my room, drive from room to restaurant, even the parking to the room was a strange 6 minute walk. Lots of poor plumbing and structural (no AC, no elevators, windows had fans inside the frame so the cold air blew into the room on the rainy stay.

Kings Canyon,"I had booked a family tour to see the Crystal Cave. I thought I had allowed myself plenty of time to arrive prior to the start. However, near the opening of the park, PG&E was performing construction work and shut traffic to one lane. We waited for 1/2 hour to get the okay for our side to go through. To make matters worse we then got stuck behind a couple from Wisconsin who apparently were not used to driving winding mountain roads. They took every wind at 5 mph. There were a dozen cars backed up behind them, but not once did they take an opportunity to pull to the side at let others pass. We arrived at the visitor center 45 min before our tour. The park representative assured us there was no way we would make the tour since we still had an hour drive to the cave. I asked if we could get a refund and he said to take it up with reservation.com. I asked how reservation.com would be able to verify whether or not we took the tour, he just shrugged his shoulders and went to the next person. Reservation.com does not give refunds, so we got stuck paying for the tour as well as dealing with a disappointed son who was looking forward to the cave. Not only that, but the park maps only offer limited information. There are only a couple of signs during the drive to show miles to the next outlook point. Really insufficient. Then once you get to a trail, there are no trail maps available. I suggest taking a phone photo of the general map at the start of the trail in order to avoid confusion. This is a government run disaster from an informational point of view. The trees are well worth the visit, though.

Although we were able to see Sherman Tree, Grants Tree then head to Kings Canyon, I wished we had an extra hour or two for the canyon.We drove to ""the end of the road"", checked out Roaring River Falls, got out for some photos of the river and the canyon in various places, but didn't have time to do much hiking. Next time we come here we will plan at least one full day for the canyon, maybe two. There are a lot of great photo landscapes as well as viewing opportunities for the birders. We stopped at Vista Point and could hear cliff swallows behind us, but couldn't ever see them. Definitely check out the Roaring River Falls near the end of the road. It is worth the 1/4 mile paved walk.","September 5, 2016","Plan Half A Day Minimum, You'll Be Glad You Did",84,"Springfield, Missouri",5
Kings Canyon,"Kings Canyon was so nice. It was not crowded at all. We were not forced to take a shuttle to different places. The road is very windy, but it is well worth the trip. There were some beautiful views along the way. We hiked to Mist Falls. I do not understand why Trip Advisor does not have it on its site. All other sources say mint takes 4-5 hours. Try 6. We stopped and rested along the way. We also had a nice lunch at a nice area 40 minutes before the Falls. You need some good hiking gear. I saw someone with flip flops and was shaking my head. The first part of the hike was in a forest area with easy minor rock climbing. At the fork, you will be directed up a rocky path to Mist Falls. The hike is quite strenuous at times. You are mostly walking on rocks. Some parts were quite steep. We were told it was another 10 minutes, but it was more like 20. It depends on your level of fitness. The Falls are stunning and well worth the hike if you start really early. Just be aware that this hike is not for the faint of heart. Kings Canyon is so beautiful.

So small that we had to go to the Giant Forest museum to get a parking permit for a person with disability in our vehicle.We could not stop us to other places, always for a parking problem.

Kings Canyon,"We camped at the Sentinel campground for four nights and it was delightful. I liked all the amenities such as being able to walk to a ranger station, shower facilities, small restaurant and campground store. Most nights there was a ranger program at the amphitheater, numerous educational ranger talks and walks. We enjoyed swimming in the South Fork of the King River near the overpass south of the campground, hiking to Zumwalt Meadow (where we saw a bear foraging in the river), and other short hikes. Very lovely campground near the King River (you can hear the river from your campsite and some campsites are right on the river bank). Campsite #12 next to a meadow was the best; however, next spring this campground will be by reservation only which will be much more strictly monitored & you will not be able to pick your campsite. I'm glad we got in before they converted to reservation only. If you want to experience this campground--come soon before they close up for the season this fall! We would definitely come back with family next time! (We have stayed at Grant's Grove campground and Sequoia, as well). Tip: Be advised there is NO cell service here.

As you stand in the trunk of one of the redwood giants it puts things into perspective of how long they have been around and just how big the trees are. The water level of the river and lake are sufficient to keep you entertained. We spent some time at bear claw falls which is truly worth the drive. It's really good to see how close to the falls you can get. The only draw back I had was paying the $30 per car to get into the park. I think $20 is more appropriate.

You get to the bottom then drive along the river for a few miles, with many places to stop and explore before the first real trail heads. The river was strong and cold with few/no pools that looked like places to wade. The bank was mostly large boulders with drop offs to swift moving - dangerous currents. Not the sort of place for small children. Near the end of the road, by the meadow, there were some sandy banks with quiet shallow water that I saw where toddlers were splashing about. The two most accessible waterfall spots are great for quick visits, or to sit and just watch while picnicking.

Kings Canyon,"The natural beauty of the parks is spectacular and the size of the trees is amazing. But be prepared for crowds! We chose Sequoia and King's Canyon in part because we heard that they were not crowded. This may be true most of the time but is certainly not true during holidays. We arrived on July 3rd and the line to get into the park took approximately 1 hour. This was with the park rangers flagging cars in without collecting the park admission fee (they did collect the fee as we left). Once inside the park the lines for shuttle buses was similarly long. At times we had to wait 35 minutes or more to get a bus since each bus that arrived at a stop was so full that it could only accommodate a few more people. Like other national parks, once you get away from the major photo spots the crowds thin out dramatically.

Kings Canyon,"Kings Canyon is worth the very long drive to get there. We pushed all the way to Cedar Grove, far into the park. The key to getting a desirable campground is to a) get there before Thursday to avoid the weekend rush and b) be there around 7 or 8 in the morning to see who is packing up and getting ready to leave. Buy your campground pass at the General Store and ask the family about to vacate their spot if you can put your tag/pass under neath theirs, and tell them to take all the time they need, and then come back after they've gone and you'll have the campground. We like hiking, jumping off huge Muir Rock into the freezing river and then sunning ourselves on the rock to warm up, then doing it all over again.The caving is terrific, especially if you're with a spelunker who can get you into the caves that are only open to members of the Speological Society.Pitching a tent on the soft pine-needle covered ground, near the sound of the rushing river, and making a campfire, is an experience that has to be experienced.

This was a disappointment although, approaching from the south, via the Sequoia National Forest we had already been able to experience the magnificent grandeur of Sequoia NP where you will find not just countless groves of enormously impressive Sequoia trees but a landscape including huge granite monoliths, the equal of those at Yosemite, like Moro Rock and views beyond to the High Sierras.

Unfortunately, when we arrived, as a result of the Rough Fire which had broken out on 7/31/15, route 180 to Cedar Grove past the Hume Lake turnoff had been closed. We camped at the Azalea Campground at Grant Grove instead in space #108 next to the meadow and a 4 min. walk on the trail over the hill to the visitor center/ranger's station/store, etc. We went on another nice hike from this campground to General Grant Tree. Enjoyed our stay but beware of falling pinecones from tall trees! Each morning the squirrels were apparently gnawing pinecones off the tree and they would fall very hard!!! The pinecones are very sharp, heavy and full of sap. We saw the squirrels scurrying to drag the pinecones to their cubbyholes. Several pinecones hit our car and camper with quite a loud thud. Luckily, none hit us in the head! (We resorted to wearing hats to protect ourselves). Best to find a site not adjacent to super tall trees. Not sure if this is a seasonal habit of theirs or not. Also, one loop of campsites didn't have any bathrooms nearby. Scope out proximity to restrooms before setting up camp if this is important to you. Day trips to Sequoia very convenient.

Kings Canyon,"Kings Canyon is very different from Sequoia NP. Where as Sequoia has it's wonderful trees, Kings Canyon has its beautiful mountains and valleys. The windy road makes its way from the top of the peaks to the valley of the park, and everything in between. All lead to breathtaking views throughout. I would certainly suggest anyone visiting Sequoia and who have the time to make your way to the end of the road to view the contrast yourself.I give this park four stars instead of five based upon my weekend summer experience. Since this park is so close to some major cities in the surrounding area, it's a weekend/day get away for those folks from these cities - sort of like their beach. There were multiple times where we saw multiple beach umbrellas, coolers and lawn chairs placed on the banks of rivers and lakes where folks were hanging out. Though I appreciate the local folks enjoying the park, I have to admit that seeing it used in such a manner was a bit of a disappointment to me and my husband. We're used to seeing state parks used in such a manner, but are not used to a national park being used in the same way.","August 10, 2015",Drive to the end of the road.,441,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",4

Kings Canyon,"We are very experienced hikers. I had the opportunity to hike the Redwood Canyon trails about a year ago, but I hiked it alone, so I returned with my wife to experience this special place. We traveled from Fresno on a Saturday morning and the drive to the scenic byway is about 40 minutes. That byway is a bit slower, as it ramps up to the park, gaining about 6,000 to 7,000 feet of elevation. Once there, we went to the information center and got maps and recommendations, after which we settled again on the Redwood Canyon trails. We parked and set off on a wonderful hike that we expected to be a 6.5 mile loop trail. The elevation gain was about 1,400-1,500 feet from the parking lot at about 6,200 feet. Somewhere along the way, we seem to have wandered onto a lakeside trail that extended our hike to 10 miles. Since it was hot, and since that trail had elevation up heading back to the parking area, this was not a great thing to happen. While I understand that this is a National Park, they easily could do a much better job of marking the trails and adding distances traveled or remaining to other points, trail junctures or the parking areas. While this was disappointing, it did not ruin the hike and it was pretty spectacular. My only suggestion is to be careful about finding/watching the trail, as this diversion was clearly not marked and clearly unexpected.","July 29, 2015",Great hiking and great trees,229,"Poway, California",4

Kings Canyon,"The resort is well located for easy access to King's Canyon. It provides a range of accommodation options suitable to most travellers budgets and needs. The staff were friendly, helpful and knowledgable at Reception, which certainly made a good impression upon arrival.We had booked in to a Powered caravan site for several days. There are plenty of them, of good size, though naturally little grass. There are also plenty of toilet blocks with outside wash up facilities and camp BBQ's. However these are in need of updating, maintenance and thorough cleaning. Instances of no hot water for some outside wash up sinks, soap scum build up in the showers, no hand soap dispensers or non working hand dryers are examples. This was disappointing especially as the camp fees were relatively high. Due to its remote location and dependence on road train deliveries, you can't expect the store to have all the usual range of goods available all the time. So it was unfortunate we arrived just before the next delivery of fuel and grocery supplies were due. Fortunately we only had a couple of days wait.The resort and camp ground is sensitively built into the environment so that visually it has minimal impact, which adds greatly to the experience of staying here.

Lots of hiking trails, water falls, and a few lodges and small markets. If you're looking to do a good amount of grocery shopping though, you will want to do it down the hill. We made our trip mid-July and temps ranged from 60's at night to 80's during the day. The campgrounds were spacious, which was helpful since we were staying in RVs. There are no hook ups though. Each camp site has a camp fire ring and bear proof food storage bin. There is a very strong emphasis on preventing bears in the area. There are public restrooms and water sources for your camping needs. Unfortunately, the only showers are coin operated, near the lodge. The only real downside we found is this area is the bugs that show up at night. Even with repellent I ended up with lots of mosquito bites.

The park has two main visitor areas -- the Grant Grove area near the entrance and the Cedar Grove area at the end of the road in the bottom of the canyon. The General Grant Tree trail is in the Grant Grove area. Roaring River Falls and Zumwalt Meadow are in the Cedar Grove area. In between is a scenic byway that takes visitors down into the canyon passing beautiful views and places to stop along the way. We spent the night at Cedar Grove and enjoyed an evening sitting beside the roaring Kings River. The end of the road is a quiet and peaceful place. We enjoyed the short trails, but longer, more strenuous trails are available.","July 16, 2015",See the Canyon That John Muir Admired,1064,"Nashville, Tennessee",5

Kings Canyon,"Kings Canyon in many ways is very similar to Yosemite. Although it is less well known, it has it's shares of amazing sights. The North Dome, the Sentinel and the Grand Sentinel are Kings Canyon's answers to Half Dome and El Capitan. The Zumwalt Meadow is a real gem in the Canyon. The Rangers are really thoughful and give great Ranger Walks. The drive in by Kings Canyon Scenic Byway is one great drive with beautiful views and very, very high! The Kings River is very beautiful and there are nice waterfalls (not as big as Yosemite though).","July 9, 2015",Kings Canyon is Yosemite's forgotten twin,253,,5
Kings Canyon,"Few years ago, we visited Sequoia National Park, but we did not have time to visit Kings Canyon. So we decided we will spent two days here to exploring the Kings Canyon NP. First day, we went to Grant Tree Trail to visit world's third largest tree - Grant Tree. Then we I hiked at North Grove Loop, it offers a close look at Big Trees and quite forest walk. For more than 2 hours, we did not see anyone on the trail - The forest was belongs to us. In the afternoon, we drove on the road 180 to see King Canyon Scenic byway. The kings river, the waterfall... Next day, we went to Big Stump Basin, Panoramic Point.... The weather was perfect, 65+ at day, and 40+ at night. Both afternoon, we got some rain, witch was awesome knowing CA is in such bad drought. Side story - at earlier evening while we stay at John Muir lodge do our reading and resting, the storm come - strong wind with thunder, but there was no rain. However, we did see Sugar pine cone rain. within 30 seconds, hundreds of pine cone (more than 17 inch long) fall down from tree and hitting car, truck. It was so much fun to watching the ""rain""","July 8, 2015",Amazing Sequoia Tree and Awesome Kings Canyon,45,"Tempe, Arizona",4

Kings Canyon,"We were on our way to LA and had about half a day to zip through the park. We chose Kings Canyon since it had been about 45 years since I had been in the area. The trip out to ""roads end"" from the King Canyon entrance took about two hours - stopped many times for various sights and sites. The General Grant area got us right up close to some really big trees, but since it was also wild flower season - end of June is a good time to be there - the irony of really tiny flowers steps away from the giants really impressed me. We also had a great treat going up the road on the west slope of the Sierras. There were some big birds wheeling in the sky. We pulled off at a pull out with a sign about the local birds. From that it was possible to identify one of the birds as a California Condor - at least that was what the picture matched. Nice to see after all the struggles there were to preserve the species.I will warn you about the Garman GPS route to go south when you want a fast route. Be careful about going off the state highway to go south. There is a great road if you like turns - about 40 miles of sawing the steering wheel. Fun if you like it, frightening if you don't.

Kings Canyon,"So this listing seems to have been diluted into a generic ""King's Canyon NP"" review, but I'm going to review the views of the canyon itself on the main road driving in - which were SPECTACULAR. Some of the best views in a canyon I've had the chance to see. The coloration on the sides of the mountains was fascinating, and being able to see the river winding along at the bottom was great. Out of Yosemite, King's Canyon, and Sequoia, I found the views **while driving** in King's Canyon to be by far the best. The road is fairly steep, but there are plenty of turnouts so don't be afraid to stop at any point to take pictures or just let people pass you or give your car (or driver) a break.The rest of the park is wonderful as well, and I recommend the Mist Falls trail which we hiked and really enjoyed.","July 6, 2015",Stunning Canyon and Mountains,32,"Atlanta, Georgia",5

Kings canyon was more lush and we enjoyed the drive and looking at the giant trees. It can get pretty crowded with cars and people alike. You can also take a shuttle to some of the destinations. Would recommend this park over Yosemite any time. Be sure to check out General Sherman tree and also General Grant! Pretty cool!

I had my God moment when we reached the bottom with just the road and the river and the walls of mountains surrounding--there is something bigger than me and he made the wonderful scenery!! The river was one of the most beautiful we have seen. This is our 7th year of visiting national parks and have seen many. My photos and video do not do this trip a justice.

Kings Canyon,"Went in a Sportsmobile Van which sits, I think, pretty high off the ground. Having gone over the side of a mountain road (not MY driving) before made me very uncomfortable in this trek up the road. It was very sad to see so many trees dying from the lack of water and infestation of bark beetles. On the way to Boyden Cave, I could see over the side of the road and into the deep, deep, valley below. It was very scary for me, so I had had enough. I couldn't go to the Roaring River Falls nor the Zumwalt Meadow. But, the river flowing was a beautiful, welcome sight. I can imagine what the river would be like had there been more snowfall and/or rain. On the way back, stopped at the General Grant Grove. The trees are massive! The fire scars on the trees show how the redwoods survived. I'll be taking my car and driving when I return to approach the park from the southern Sequoia side. BTW, I had purchased the Senior Pass several years ago, and there was no charge to enter here.","June 20, 2015",Awesomeness,38,,5

Kings Canyon,"Went to Sequoia National FOREST and Kings Canyon National Park. Stayed at the John Muir Lodge in Grant Grove Village. Winding road from the Village to Road's End is about 35 miles and in late May, it took us about 2 hours to drive on-way, which included the time we spent stopping for photos once and two additional stops -- and restful, long lingering -- at waterfalls along the way. Along the drive, you eventually see the rushing river, which was beautiful. First falls we stopped at was Grizzly Falls. There is a bathroom building there. Second falls we stopped at was Mist Falls, about 1/4 mile walk from the parking area. Cliffs along the way to Road's End were wonderful. A little before the Road's End area, you will find Zumwalt Meadows. There is a bathroom building here at the parking area. On the next day, we drove bout 11 miles from Grant Grove Village to Hume Lake. Snack bar was closed on Wednesday, the day we went to the lake. But pretty lake with mountains in the background.

In April it was a little cool and I was glad to have a long-sleeve shirt on with my shorts. The trail meanders through the forest and crosses over itself several times so it's hard to keep track of where you've been but you really can't get lost. Panoramic Point is excellent and the short trail, although uphill going to the point is easy with a couple benches along the way. We walked up the short path and then took the longer loop down. On the loop there was a second Point with what we thought was an even better view. You can see Hume Lake from these points. Most things were closed in April (they open in May) as was the road after Kings Canyon Lodge. This lodge wasn't really open yet but the owner said he had ice cream so we enjoyed a small ice cream cone while watching the hummingbirds on the patio. The road was closed just beyond the lodge. We then drove to Hume Lake and walked around some. There were people scattered around the lake fishing and some kids were swimming (brrrrrrr!). The only ""problem"" we had was the speed of the traffic driving down the mountain into Fresno. Since we're not familiar with the windy road we were taking it slower than most vehicles.

This highway provides spectacular canyon views and culminates at Zumwalt Meadow- a not to be missed scenic hike. We found it easiest to take General's Highway and visit Sequoia Park first. While driving down General's Highway, stop by the visitor center to pick up tickets for Crystal Caverns-if they are sold out for the day, you can pick up tickets for the following day. You can see the General Sherman tree- a 0.4 mile downhill hike on a well paved path. (The way back is strenuous but has many benches.) Moro Rock should not be missed-there are 400 steps to the top but the view is fantastic. There is a drive through tree. We also enjoyed hiking to Sunset Rock. You leave from the Tree Museum. It is a 0.7 mile walk each way but it is mostly flat and ends on a large rock overlooking a canyon. All of this makes for a fun but slightly strenuous day. (We are both in our 60's) The following day you should go along the King's Canyon Scenic Highway.It is truly spectacular. Before you begin, stop and visit General Grant tree. Not to missed are Boyden Cave, Grizzly falls, several scenic overlooks and the Zumwalt Meadow walk which is the end point of the King's Canyon Scenic Highway.Unfortunately, this weekend we discovered that King's Canyon Scenic Highway is entirely closed during the winter. No cave, no amazing views, no waterfall, no meadow. All we could go to in Kings Canyon was the visitor center and the General Grant tree. Crystal Cave in Sequoia Park is also closed until May. This is true despite the fact that there was no snow to be seen. They are concerned about winter storms and possible rock slides. While these are both spectacular parks, if you have the option, I recommend waiting until all the major areas are open for viewing.","March 23, 2015",Visit between May and October,87,"San Leandro, California",5

Kings Canyon,"We placed ourselves among the less energetic, and so the shorter and easier Kings Creek Walk at the Canyon base was what we chose. Even this walk which led us through lush ferns and eucalyptus to a platform with views of the sheer canyon walls above was particularly difficult at times for some of our group. The walk though was pleasant enough with rewards around every corner and rock on the route.","March 12, 2015",Oh To Be More Energetic,737,"Brisbane, Australia",5

Kings Canyon,"We went to this park last July, after visiting Los Angeles for five days, and it was just what the doctor ordered. It is hard to describe the natural beauty of the whole park. Of course, the trees are the main feature, but there is so much in landscape and wildlife to see. My daughter and I spent more time exploring the forest areas. Shuttle buses are the only way to get around. We parked at the Giant Forest Museum and took the shuttle bus to various stops, ending at the Lodge Pole Visitor's Center. My son and husband did rock climbing, and took the Moro Rock shuttle. Keep track of the time, so you don't miss the last route back to your car.","March 11, 2015",Beautiful and Regenerative,44,NY,5

Kings Canyon,"However much you have read, when you finally see the giant sequoias, you will yet be amazed. If you come from the North, go through the park from Fresno on route 180 and come out using 198 at Three Rivers. Tulare which is right on route 99. If you are heading south, Tulare is a good overnight place as you finish a hard day on the park, and then reach Tulare which is directly on Route 99 and you can start off your journey right away. I would say that a one day stay in the park is adequate, starting with a visit to the Grant Grove, followed by the Giant Forest, and maybe one more place. As you drive through from the entrance on Route 180, its at least a three hour drive without stops to come out at Three Rivers on Route 198. Budget for an hour at each spot - Grant Grove and Giant forest. If you are coming from the South the reverse will apply.Snow Chains for tires are needed in winter and were mandatory as mentioned on the website. But no one checked or asked. Walmart was kind enough to accept the chains back as we had the original receipt and an unopened box. The slopes around the trees get iced over, and walking is difficult. So good to have spikes on shoes. No plastic soles please!! The ice is pretty hard to fall on....","January 16, 2015","Amazing trees, snow in California",27,"Rajkot, India",5
Kings Canyon,"Worth stopping, at least to see the big tree, the second-largest in the world. If you're just in the area for a day or two, your time would be better spent over in Sequoia. But if you're backpacking and camping overnight, this is a superb choice. Some good hikes, too.","January 16, 2015",Definitely worth a visit,218,South Africa,4
Kings Canyon,"The clear focal point of these two national parks is the giant sequoia trees. And they do not not disappoint. It is truly awe inspiring to walk around the base of a living thing that stretches 300 feet to the sky and has been around for 2,000 years. While there is plenty to see here, including stunning canyons and mountain ranges, you cannot leave without seeing the General Sherman and General Grant trees. We visited in December, and while much of the parks were closed, the snow covered ground adds an distinct beauty to the surroundings because the red trees pop out against the white background. We loved our visit and will definitely return in the summer. ","January 6, 2015",There is something enchanting about these giant trees.,41,"Heber City, Utah",5
Kings Canyon,Being from out of state and not very sure about driving on snow and I had reservations about coming here in the December. I read the parks website and also called their weather information phone number (which I was unable to understand the recording). I went on and wondered if I would be turned away at the park gate. I still am very confused about the snow chain policy. When I arrived every vehicle was welcomed in the park. I did notice a sign saying you needed snow chains or a 4 wheel drive vehicle with snow tires. I only saw a few cars with snow chains and I saw a big variety of cars including small two wheel drive vehicles. I assume that under bad conditions they would actually enforce the snow chain policy. I entered the park on 180 and saw the trees at Grant grove and drove through the park exiting on 198 near Three Rivers driving on snow and ice much of the way. I wish the park conditions were more clearly spelled out. I went in December and had no issue.,"January 4, 2015",coming here in the winter,447,"Dallas, Texas",5

Kings Canyon,"Seeing the Giant Sequoias for the first time feels like an encounter with an old friend. We visited this park after being in Yosemite National Park for a few days. Yosemite certainly has it's charms, but we preferred Sequoia National Park for it's peacefulness. It is possible to find a trail in the Giant Forest that leads away from all crowds. This also means, of course, that the park is less tourist-friendly in terms of transportation (there is no shuttle system between attractions) and food options. Nonetheless I recommend travelling here to experience being in the presence of the oldest, largest trees on Earth.

We had visitors from Romania and took them to Yosemite the first day. We spent the night in Mariposa, CA. The next day we drove to the Sequoia National Park. You really must have a minimum of 1 day to enjoy a drive and a small hike through the trees. We drove in from the north. It takes a long time to drive out the south entrance, but still well worth it. We took time to walk the loop to see the General Grant Tree ( Kings Canyon ) and then the General Sherman Tree ( Sequoia National Park). This is a must see! There are many other sights, but this is certainly the minimum you should do.","December 2, 2014",Awe Inspiring Sequoias,8,"Mill Valley, California",5

Kings Canyon,"It's a nice park but it's a one time visit for me. I love the RIM walk, took me almost 3 hours since I stopped often to take photos. I started around 6am and by 10am, I'm done which was perfect or else it'd be too hot. I didn't go with a tour, picked up a car rental at Ayers Rock airport and drove 300Km to Kings Canyon. It was an easy drive but quite lonely on the road since not many drivers beside tour buses. Car rental allows to drive 100Km a day so pay extra per Km if you go over. Gas is expensive but once in a life time experience so I didn't mind at all. Thanks for one person on tripadivsor who suggested me to do this. I love the RIM walk, better than Uluru base walk.","November 26, 2014",Nice park,56,California,4
Kings Canyon,"Truly magnificent and spectacularly gigantic sequoia trees abound in the Kings Canyon and the Sequoia National Park. The twin national parks are situated in the southern Sierra Nevada mountains in California. The parks are famous for their giant sequoia trees. The General Sherman tree is the Sequoia National Parks prime attraction, while the General Grant tree in the Kings Canyon National Park is the stand out tree. Both Parks are connected by the Generals Highway. To reach both parks requires traversing about 15 miles of switch back- full of steep mountain roads. If you are not experienced in navigating or driving on these type of winding roads, make sure you make use of the sideroad ramps to allow faster moving vehicles to pass. It takes about one hour drive from each of the park entrance to either Kings Canyon or Sequoia National National Park. You'll need a full day to see and do the things that needs to be seen and done inside the two parks. It could get cold in the park so bring some sweater or warm clothing.","November 19, 2014",Amazing Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park,223,"Sarnia, Canada",3

Go to the end and stand on Muir rock to look down into the 8+feet of water to the clear green bottom. Walk around the meadows, go into the cave, hike to waterfalls.

It has the same beautiful granite rock faces, beautiful lush valleys and vegetation, tumbling waterfalls (though smaller and less impressive) and clear rivers.Additionally, the scenic drive down into the Cedar Grove part of the Canyon is spectacular and fun. I recently spent 2 days/nights camping and hiking in the Canyon which, depending on your hiking desires, is plenty of time to appreciate and enjoy what the Canyon offers. I visited all the major stops along the scenic drive, such as Grizzly Falls, Roaring River Falls, Zumwalt Meadows and the General Grant Tree/Grove. I also did 2 long hikes: Paradise Valley and the Don Cecil trail to Lookout Peak. Paradise Valley is a very popular hike and for good reason as it has varied terrain, good shade, the waterfall, parts that are challenging and parts that are level. Definitely make it to Mist Falls but turn around at Lower Campground as there’s not much beyond that. I did see 3 different bears along the way. I also did the Lookout Peak hike merely for a butt-kicking and for the view at the top. Otherwise, I would not recommend this hike. It’s all uphill for 6 miles and not much of interest along the way until the very top, which is actually on national forest land rather than national park. The view was negatively impacted by all the smoke from recent wildfires. The camping was adequate. As is true at most national parks, the sites are simply too close together and limit privacy but are otherwise comparable. I strongly recommend going to this park, especially if you’ve already been to Yosemite. It’s simply beautiful.","August 6, 2014",Spectacular alternative to Yosemite Valley,212,California,4
Kings Canyon,"Arguably the most beautiful area in the Sierras - certainly vying for the most beautiful scenery. The drive down to Zumwalt Meadows is lengthy because there is a long section of windy road (make sure the kids take their travel sickness meds). But it is worth it - the River is especially beautiful and I would say that Zumwalt Meadow is probably the most beautiful meadow in the whole of the Sierras. Take the trail from the parking lot, and you will find a footbridge across the River, then a 1-mile loop trail around Zumwalt Meadow. The Park Service has done an outstanding job with the trail maintenance and the bridge. Be aware that parts of the trail involve stepping over rock outcrops, so the entire loop is not wheelchair accessible. But certainly significant amounts of the trail are passable for everyone ","August 6, 2014",Kings River and Zumwalt Meadow,6,LA,5
Kings Canyon,This was an incredible place. We were all mesmerized by the beauty as well as the size of the amazing Sequoia trees. My kids said they felt as though we were not on this planet.

Kings Canyon,Went camping in Kings Canyon and what an experience it was. We usually camp near the ocean so this was quite a bit different for us. The campsites were HUGE. We went with my wife's family and we put 3 tents and a 13 foot canned ham trailer in one site and everyone had plenty of room. The campsite was right on the river and the sound of the rushing water was great. There are lots of trails and places to fish. It was more than worth the 4 hour trip and the scary ride down into the canyon. If you love nature you'll love Kings Canyon. We're going back next year for sure!,"July 30, 2014",This place you GOTTA see!!,22,"Ventura, California",5
Kings Canyon,I absolutely LOVE Kings Canyon! We drove down to Grizzly Falls and walked around. The drive is absolutely beautiful down to the bottom where you drive along the river.

You've also got General Grant Tree and quite a few other trails to check out. Beware of the afternoon thunderstorms in the summer. ,"July 30, 2014",So gorgeous!,62,New Mexico,5

The campsites are not too secluded (some campsites are right next to the main road), and most of the spots are cluttered together.

Kings Canyon,"A recent reviewer commented that is is not like Yosemite Valley. I agree. The place is not crowded, most people speak English, You don't struggle to find parking. You don't have to take a shuttle anywhere, You can stop on the side of the road and enjoy the astounding scenery. Traffic is very light. The river is beautiful-rocks, water. We made the trip one day and were so impressed that we went back the next day. There are only so many ways that a person can comment on the beauty of a drive or a spot. According to one brochure this is the deepest canyon in the US. Driving to the end of the road is almost like being in another word. There is a lodge there that serves food, but most people appeared to be camping. We stopped at a little mom and pop motel/snack bar in the National Forest that has the old time gas pumps that use gravity to work, not electricity. We saw several cars drive up to the pumps, the drivers stared at them a while and then drove off. With so very much to see and do in this park and in the nearby Yosemite, you might be tempted to pass this by. That would be a mistake on your part. Perhaps a bit of a stretch for young children who get bored easily, but everyone else would love it.","July 14, 2014",Not a Yosemite Valley.,86,Georgia,5
Kings Canyon,"Kings Canyon National Park is a true beauty. One cannot help but marvel at the extraordinary views and landscapes that can be seen along the scenic byway. There are so many sights to take in throughout the drive, and many places to stop and experience the natural beauty first-hand. One of the easiest waterfalls to access is Grizzly Falls, as it's right off of the main road and a short walk from the parking area. In the Springtime, the waterfall is magnificent, as the melting mountain snow produces a scene like nothing else. Boyden Cavern, which is also directly off of the main highway, is a great place to stop and experience a guided cave tour, (for a small fee). The cave tour includes a point where you get to experience true, absolute darkness. The many campgrounds in the park are a great way to experience the park overnight. There's nothing like laying in your tent, staring up at the stars, and listening to the quietness of the wind flowing through the trees. Along with the abundant wildlife you may see, Kings Canyon National Park offers people a truly remarkable nature experience.","July 14, 2014",A Sight to Behold,7,"Visalia, California",5

Our bus nearly collided with one coming towards us. My wife and I were thrown forward off of our feet when the obviously inexperienced driver (she made the whole trip a thrill ride) slammed on the brakes.

The small car trail and the hike allows you to see the full spectrum of mountains and lakes in the region.

We drove in from the north, through King's Canyon first, and saw the General Grant tree, visitor center, and the grove where the tree is located. Very friendly to us out of shape flatlanders, but still a lot of walking on uneven surfaces. You can see a lot just from the car, but getting out and up close to the trees is incredible. Next we drove down to Sequoia, and by then the crowds were picking up. Parking fills up, but they provide speedy and frequent shuttles, like every five minutes. The General Sherman tree is billed as the largest in the world, and is down a half mile paved trail. I do not recommend this for anyone out of shape. It is pretty steep, and at 7000 feet, we were all out of breath. I left my wife and friend at the bottom, and retrieved the car, and drove down to get them.

Use Canyon View Campground as your base (located near Roads End, about one hour from Big Stump Entrance - note the windy road has made many a non-driver sick, so be prepared to stop) and make sure to hike in Zumwalt Meadows, enjoy the cool rushing water of the Kings River (be careful though as the water is swift and dangerous at most locations), take a tour of Boyden Cavern, visit Roaring River Falls and definitely take time to visit the Giant Sequoias in Grant Grove on our way in or out of the Park (located close to the Big Stump entrance). Give yourself extra time to drive in or out of the area through Sequoia National Park (using the Ash Mountain Entrance/Exit) and check out the General Sherman Tree! *Bear Tip: I have camped in Kings Canyon three years in a row, and each year I've seen at least 3 bears. This past year, one bear even opened a truck and started eating our food. So, do keep all of your food and toiletries in the supplied bear boxes and DO NOT, ever, store these items in the back of your car.

See the General Grant tree in the Grant grove, walk around for 60 minutes, have lunch at the restaurant (or eat at Sherwood Cafe on way back) and spend another 45 minutes at the Visitor Center.Not quite as beautiful as visiting Yosemite but WAY easier to get there and back.","November 26, 2013",Breathtaking Experience 60 minutes East of Fresno,34,"Clovis, California",5

Kings Canyon,Had a great time at Grant Grove with my wife and seeing the giant sequoia's for the first time(had to sneak in). The trees and the fragrance in the air was refreshing. The park was closed because of the government shut down so there were no other people to contend with. Very rich. Drove down Kings Canyon Scenic Byway which was open to the end of Route 180 and the views were breathtaking. It was too bad the rest of the park was closed for our once in a lifetime trip. We really didn't need any help to look at trees. Yosemite Park road was open but the falls were closed to us.

We had stayed in that park, but in the western part at John Muir Lodge. It was probably a 30 - 40 minute drive from where we stayed to the Road's End in Kings Canyon.

There are numerous Viewpoints along the road for photo opportunities. I stopped at Boyden's Cave and purchased the tour, which was a bit underwhelming. I believe it is a private concession vendor and not run by the NP or NFS. The Cedar Grove Visitor Center will be along the left further down Hwy 180. The bridge was under repair in August 2013 and you cannot reach the store or lodge from Hwy 180. After passing several campgrounds, there is a waterfall on the right reached by a 0.3 mile stroll. It's not a hike rather just a short walk. Stop at Zumwalt's Meadow and hike around the Meadow. Pack a lunch, since eating along the trail in a quiet forest was wonderful. The hikes at Road's End will be longer, since I could not find any short trails here. Many were playing in the river, and jumping off Muir's Rock (sic).

Spend some time in the slow safe parts of the river (close to roads end) and also do the Roaring Falls walk (it's short, less than 5 minutes). The waterfull is beautiful (but do stay out of the water, people die there from falling in!). The river in the summer isn't too cold to enjoy, my kids had fun swimming for over an hour.

Kings Canyon,"This national park is less crowded than it's nearby cousin, Yosemite. So if you would like to visit somewhere peaceful and beautiful and serene, then come to Sequoia and Kings Canyon dual National park. It is hard to compete with the largest living organism in the world, The General Sherman Tree or the beauty of Crystal Cave or climbing up 300 feet of stairs in 1/4 mile to the top of Moro Rock. There are so many walks and for the adventurous the trails to waterfalls and the back country is outstanding. The drive down to Cedar Grove has you on the edge of your seat with sharp cliff drop offs that are beautiful. The easy to walk 200 yards to Roaring River Falls is a must see.Then there is Boyden cave to test your uphill walking skills. If you like camping I would recommend the Azalea campground for sheer beauty but Sunset campground is nice too. The little cabins are cute and there are a few with restrooms, otherwise you have a central bath house. Of course you can stay in a lodge there or at Wakasaki Village if you need amenities.

As we drove through the forests and up and down the winding roads, we were amazed that anyone had been able to do this on horseback or in wagons and on foot. If you come, set aside at very least a few days so that you will be able to take a few hikes through the forests. I highly recommend that you take the hike at the Museum with the Forest Ranger. It is an easy trail and was very informative and interesting.","August 14, 2013",Beautiful scenery everywhere you look,32,"Indiana, Pennsylvania",5

Kings Canyon,"I had never been to any National park, but had been wanting to for many years. My family and I had originally planned on going to Yosemite but it was a bit farther then we had planned on so we opted for Sequoia Kings Canyon instead, and let me tell you I am so glad we did!We went 3 times within 3 weeks, first through the Ash Mountain entrance because we were going to Crystal Cave. The road is so winding and steep that you have to drive 15-20 miles per hour, everyone got so nauseous and my 5 year old had to vomit- not fun!!Crystal Cave it self was nice, and the walk down was very nice, not sure if it was worth the drive- because later I found out that going through the Grant Grove entrance and going down Generals Highway is so much better (easier to drive) then the Ash Mountain entrance.From the Grant Grove entrance you can go to Cedar Grove. The drive is 36 miles but so beautiful! With a lot of places to stop and snap pictures along the way.My family and I much more preferred the Kings Canyon part of the parks, because I believed there was much more to do, or maybe I am a bit biased because I love waterfalls and roaring rivers and Kings Canyon is where it's at!If you are looking for a place to get away from 'life' and enjoy your family, Sequoia Kings Canyon is a wonderful place to do it! We stayed at the Grants Grove Rustic cabins for one of our stays and it was perfect, and a good drive to anywhere in the parks.","August 6, 2013",It's like as if you went to another world!,6,,5

Lots of wildlife, including bears. Lots of hiking trails. We spent a night at Cedar Grove which is off the main Generals highway that connects Sequoia and Kings Canyon. The main area where this park towers over Yosemite is the crowds. Yosemite, especially the valley, is packed to the gills.

Kings Canyon,"Kings canyon is between Sequoia NP and Yosemite NP and is a fascinating geological and scenic marvel. The kings river is crystal clear all along the canyon and enjoyable even though it was too cold for us to swim in August. The main attraction is the scenery and the camping/hiking opportunity. Many lovely campsites in the valley and also throughout the area with many requiring long arduous hikes on the dusty granite trails. The river provided numerous waterfalls, whitewater rapids and clear green pools which are stunning to behold. One can literally see the fish in the water from 50 ' away and easily see they are rainbow trout. We hiked the mist falls trail which took us about an hour and a half to reach the very enjoyable falls with many nice views along the way. We went beyond that to paradise valley which gave us a chance to see a black bear up close! A well as some terrific high sierra campgrounds.

Kings Canyon,"If you are travelling in Southwest USA, the Sequoia National Park is a must see. It is much less crowded than Yosemite – and even if you have seen giant sequoias at the Mariposa Grove in Yosemite, you will be amazed by the beauty of the big trees groves in Sequoia National Park. This is the real thing, like seeing elephants in the wild compared to elephants in a zoo. Plan to stay for at least two nights. Staying inside the park at the Wuksachi Lodge is recommended. A room outside the park is less expensive – but you will lose too much time on transport, easily an hour each way, so choosing the Lodge is much better. The Wuksachi is located only fifteen minutes by car from the largest cove of giant sequoias, the Giant Forest, which also has the biggest tree of them all, the General Sherman.Hiking the Giant Forest trails is a real pleasure. The Big Trees Trail near the museum and the Crescent Meadows Trail also in this area are both quite easy and very recommendable. We saw two bears less than 50ft away on the Big Trees Trail one late afternoon. And this is not unusual. You are unlucky if you do not see bears when you are at Sequoia.Near the hotel we saw also deer, chipmunks and a colony of marmots by a wooden bridge below the parking lot. Other guests saw two bears from the windows of the restaurant at breakfast. The giant sequoias themselves are very impressive, you will never get tired of admiring these beautiful, orange colored and very elegant – more than a thousand years old – gigantic living organisms. Some are over two thousand years old.A half day tour by the Sequoia Sightseeing Tours is available from the Wuksachi Lodge. It is not cheap, but very recommendable. The tour takes you around to many of the major sights in the Giant Forest area and includes also time to climb to the top of Moro Rock. The tour guide named Paul has lived all his life in the area and is very knowledgeable and friendly – and will draw your attention to interesting details you might easily have missed.The Sequoia National Park was one of the biggest highlights of our trip to Southwest USA during the summer of 2013.","July 29, 2013",Giants in the wild,175,"Aarhus, Denmark",5

Kings Canyon,"Our family of 5 (kds ages 13, 16 and 22) did a tour of the Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Park area in June of 2013. We were coming from Yosemite (via Fresno) so entering at Kings Canyon and then going over to Sequoia was a good plan. We spent a day in Kings Canyon and then a day in Sequoia National Park and that was enough time to see the major attractions. The Giant Sequoai's are the main attractions at both parks and these groves alone are worth the trip as these trees are truly majestic and immense in size (the largest by volume in the world). The drive into and out of Kings Canyon is also a great drive with a lot of scenic overlooks and then the road follows the canyon floor and the river towards the end. There are several great hikes to do in both parks. The meadow trail in Kings Canyon is very nice as the views are excellent and the birds and wildlife on the loop trail are diverse. There are seveal longer hikes that looked good in the canyon but we ran out of time. The Grant's grove in Kings Canyon is home to the General Grant tree which is very impressive as is the dead tree in the Grant Grove that has been there for hundredes of years as the trees decay at an extremely slow rate due to their high tannin levels that ward off insects and degradation. I would allow for a full day in the Canyon staying at the lodge in the back of the canyon and then drive over to Sequoia the next morning and stay overnight in the Three Rivers area the next day. In Sequoia there are several groves of giant trees including the General Sherman (the largest tree in the world by volume). The walking trails are farily flat and some are paved in this area so there are hikes for every level of hiker. The Giant Tree Museum is very intersting and I recommend stopping for 30-45 mins to read all about the giant trees and learn a lot of neat facts about them. We also did the Meadow trail and saw the house built out of a fallen redwood at the end of the meadow trail which was amazing it has lasted so long and that someone lived it in every summer for multiple years. We also saw our only Black Bear on our trip to CA that included Yosemite and the Kings Canyon/Sequoia area so the family was happy they got to see a bear. The two days in the two parks was the right amount of time and then we flew out of Bakersfield on United which gave us a shorter drive then driving back to San Fran (where we flew in) and I was able to get better prices then flights out of Fresno which is the closest airport to the parks. FYI-the entrance fee to Kings Canyon and Sequoia are combined so once you pay the entry fee for the week it is good for both parks.","July 7, 2013",Trees are the Main Attraction,190,"Beavercreek, Ohio",5
Kings Canyon,After spending 3 days/4 nights in Yosemite we headed to Sequoia/Kings Canyon for 2 days. I wouldn't say it's better/nicer than Yosemite but it was a nice park to visit if you're in the area. It's a lot different than Yosemite with all of the huge trees. It also doesn't have all the crowds that Yosemite has so it's very enjoyable. To be able to see a lot with limited time we drove the Kings Canyon By-Way using this website (drive #4 as our guide) http://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/driveviewsum.htm#CP_JUMP_108147We knew we wouldn't be able to do everything on the list because of time so we just stopped & explored when we wanted to.There isn't much for amenities so plan ahead with where you're staying and/or camping.

We stopped everywhere to take photos of the trees and overlooks and never once saw another person until we stayed at our lodge. Numerous trails for every ability, trails are all marked and the Rangers at the visitor centers were great at pointing you to the hikes to see. We spent two days here and we could had easily stayed two more just to take in the peace and quiet of the park. When you go on a 5 mile hike you want to see wildlife and scenery and not see people and this was exactly what we got. Numerous deer, squirrels and even a blackbear.

Kings Canyon,"Kings Canyon was much better than I could have imagined with huge, easily accessible groves of thousand year-old Sequoias, towering pines, several easy-yet awesome trails, a scenic Le Mans-like drive winding 3000 feet down into a canyon with sheer, granite walls carved by the glacier; cool, roaring rivers and waterfalls, lush meadows (Zumwalt) and very few people. Repeat-very few people so that I could really have time to savor the incredible beauty and energy of it all because it is very easy to access so many of the fabulous and diverse areas compared to other popular National parks.I drove in via Hwy 245 from Visalia/Three Rivers which was an awe inspiring steady climb to 6000 ft. through a fragrant (with windows down) canopy of huge trees and lush vegetation growing from the sheer rock cliffs. This is NOT a road for RV's or those who get car sick.Be sure to get/use a senior pass at the entry gate ($10 for lifetime) if you're 62 or over, or ask about other passes for discounts on entry Also, get and read the park newspaper (at entry) for updated info and stop at the visitor center buy a trail guide if you plan to get the most out of the amazing scenic trails and/or ask for details on the ranger talks and tours. Do remember to use the lower gears on most of the roads to save your brakes (from overheating).I spent 4 days visiting Kings & Sequoia parks entering from both Hwy 198 & Hwy 180 via various routes and it wasn't enough. I stayed in Three Rivers at Sequoia RV Ranch with FHU due to projected 107 temps, but most campers I spoke with were happy with the camping facilities (except the heat) in both parks.","June 8, 2013","Exhilirating & Breathtaking, yet Tranquil",415,"Cardiff-by-the-Sea, California",5
Kings Canyon,"A far better nature area than expected, There were not many people there and our neighbors when camping were Pileated Woodpeckers. The trees were beautiful and quite tall, have to crink your neck to appreciate them, and difficult to fit into a photo. The greenery was a welcomed pleasure from the flat brown topography when driving to the parks. Hiking in the mountains was not difficult and the views were second to none.","June 5, 2013",Excellent for hiking and camping,54,"Houston, Texas",5

Hardly anyone seems to have heard of this canyon and yet it's far greener and prettier than the Grand Canyon, and more accessible too as you can drive right down into it.

Very highly recommended.","June 4, 2013",Better than the Grand Canyon and Yosemite rolled into one,19,"Leicestershire, United Kingdom",5
Kings Canyon,"What a lucky break on our part. We could not get reservations in Yosemite campgrounds so we thought we would settle for second best at Sequoia. We were so wrong. Sequoia was a true delight and a real wilderness adventure. No crowds, fantastic spacious campgrounds. Wonderful views and hikes. Everything we were looking for and more. It was only a short drive ( 1 hour) to Yosemite so we got the best of both worlds.

Kings Canyon,"Just returned from Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks for two days and had a great time. Travelled with my hubby and 23 and 16 year old girls. We stayed in three rivers and left early each morning for the beautiful drive into the park (about 40 minutes total, but gorgeous!!) The first day we went to Moro Rock, totally worth the climb to the top!, just take your time, Crescent meadow, where we saw a mother and baby deer, and the Auto Log, really nice to sit on top of. The sequoia trees are giant and beautiful! We stayed in three rivers at Comfort inn and it was very nice. I would suggest the riverside inn to eat, the mexican rest. isnt very good, and stay away from We three bakery, yuk. The second day we went to the general sherman tree, then lodgepole visitors center and then grant grove to see the general grant tree, we took the north loop trail near there and hiked all by ourselves in Kings Canyon np.

We had great time for two nights in the Memorial Day weekend. Even though it's on 6,500 ft elevation and temperature dropped after sunset, we felt pretty comfortable by the camp fire since the place is kind of valley and there was no wind.

Kings Canyon,"This is the review you never think you're going to write about some trees... But here it is: Of all of the places i have visited in my life this is one of the best, most inspiring, jaw dropping spiritual experiences of my entire life. These trees are like nothing you have ever experienced before. I guarantee it. Stay in one of the cabins at kings Canyon. see the General Sherman and then drive down through Sequoia... The highway winds around the back side of the Sierras and the road shades over until all of a sudden these golden glowing tree trunks begin to appear through the shade. Somehow they grab the light and are illuminated. Get out walk around and it will hit you... it's like a high... Then drive down through the miles California Orange Groves. Stop and get out and smell the heavenly scent of Orange Blossoms.. Trust me me it is like nothing you ever experienced. Pure nature... People will look at you strangely every time you try to recount the journey... JUST GO!

We were there in the early Spring so many things weren't open yet, the the weather was good, the crowds small, and the hikes fabulous.

Kings Canyon,"I am a very frequent visitor to the Sierra Nevada, and I have run the gamut of backpacking, camping, hotel suites, etc throughout the Sierra. I have also traveled throughout Southeast Asia, Europe (including over a dozen trips to the Swiss Alps), and I can say, without a doubt, that this is one of my favorite natural places. As a caveat, I live somewhat nearby, but it is really something special. If you are a newbie to the Sierra, I'd say fighting for space in Yosemite Valley should be a priority, but if you have the time or ability to make repeat visits, this is absolutely a highlight. Try to visit in Spring when the snow is still on the peaks and the rivers are flowing hard. If you are a backpacker, it is such an amazing playground that one could spend a lifetime exploring. If not, at least drive down to Road's End along with seeing the ""big trees"" in Sequoia. I cannot comment on the facilities here because I really don't use them much, instead using the designation of the area as a national park and wilderness as a basis for many adventures. If Yosemite, even in the backcountry, leaves you wanting for solitude, this is your place! I suspect, like most national parks in the west, that they are minimal and mediocre at best (for food, lodging, etc). However, if you are the least bit adventurous and interested in the grandest of natural places, this is a place you cannot miss.","April 22, 2013",One of the Best,70,"Los Angeles, California",5

For about 70% of the views and much more solitude--whether with your with a group or not, this park beats it. They finally have a somewhat pricey place to stay if you are not camping..but it was worth every cent. Rangers very helpful...you can see a lot from the Generals Highway and of course hiking is very good. I live in Sequoia sempevirens land(Redwoods) and these are different beasts, yes just as beautiful...I would enter from the southwest also,as another person wrote...one day is too short,but if that is all you have..do it...yes, the smog has diminished the view towards the valley.

I enjoyed the Sequoias at Mariposa Grove in Yosemite...but here they were even more impressive (and immense). Strongly recommend entering from the southwest and driving up the road where you're greeted by the Four Guardsmen. Hiked down from the parking lot to General Sherman and then back up...quite a trek but had to do it. Felt as if I cheated this park but time constraints forced only a one day visit.

That said, I was able to visit the General Grant Giant Tree area in my sports car without chains. At 6000+ altitude, it's cold. It was clear in Fresno, and foggy in the mountains. But that makes for some interesting pictures. These tree's are so high that looking up in the fog or a clear day doesn't really give you any perspective.

I have made numerous visits to the National Parks that are within a short drive (Kings Canyon, Sequoia, and Yosemite) One of my favorite spots to go is Grant's Grove. Grant's grove is just inside the Kings Canyon Park entrance on highway 180.My most memoabel trip was just done several days ago. I drove up early in the morning and was at the park at about 7:00 AM. It had just recently snowed and when I got to the Grant's Grove parking lot, it was empy. I had the entire place to myself.The paved trails around the grove were easy to navigate (even in the snow) and I had a chance to take in all the surroundings without any disturbances. Just incredible.If you have the attitude of, ""Why go to the grand canyon to stare at a hole in the ground, or to the forest to look at trees"", then this is not your spot. You simply will not appreciate itOf course there is much more to do than just go to Grants Grove. The drive to Cedar Grove, about another 30 miles or so will reveal some incredible scenery with the opportunity to explore some caverns.It is a beautiful park and everyone who comes to California to see Yosemite really needs to carve some time out of there day to go to this park as well.","January 23, 2013",Incredible Morning at General Grant,41,"Fresno, California",4

We were told by other campers it was worth the drive and our friends did not lead us astray. We will return as two nights three days were not enough time.

Sequoia National Park has one spectacular valley, Kern Canyon, that runs north-south near the eastern border, and there are some groves of giant sequoia in Kings Canyon Park, but the name of each park accurately reflects their most important features. Both are relatively quiet and unspoilt. I went in March and so snow was a driving problem when at high altitude. For those tree huggers and amature photographers, King's Canyon is your mecca. This is a place to drive slowly, spend time bonding with nature, and realising how insignifcant one is when standing next to a giant sequoia.

Take the time to explore the turnouts and trails. A short walk will take you from most of the crowd into the cool, quiet shade of these giant trees which have provoked wondrous response for hundred of years.

If you are coming from the north or west on CA 180 do not be discouraged by Fresno and the smog.

Kings Canyon,"If you think the ‘other’ notable Canyon in Arizona is inspiring then Kings Canyon has to be on a subtly equal footing. Carved into a glacial U shape this Canyon has striking and unique features all tightly wound up in some very steep ravines with outstanding views. The Kings River surges along this narrow valley floor while being fed by several beautiful waterfalls. Interposed with all of this are gorgeous, gentle meadows with magnificent wildflowers and rolling grasses.Stop at any of the designated overlooks and the views will have your ‘jaw dropping’ in amazement. Short hikes on paved paths will bring you to roadside waterfalls and seeing inside a cave will give you goose bumps! Visiting Cedar Grove Village will provide some facilities and services, eating at a quaint lodge or picnicking will give you the energy to do even more! It’s all waiting when you decide to visit Kings Canyon - a significant gem on the road ending at the wilderness! The geological diversity in Kings Canyon will have you snapping away non-stop on your camera. Take a whole day (if not more) to fully appreciate the entire area up to and including Roads End. Our favourites (too many to mention all) had to be the stunning overlooks, Roaring Falls and the gorgeous Zumwalt Meadow hike. Everything beyond this is total wilderness and will require a permit. One of the positives of coming here is that unlike other major National Parks, this area has far fewer visitors – something we don’t understand having seen the splendour of this Canyon.Enjoy your visit!","September 19, 2012",A significant 'gem' on a road ending at 'wilderness'.....,674,Australia,5

Kings Canyon,"This was a fun family Labor Day weekend trip with 3 other families. 18 of us aged 45 thru 6. We arrived late Friday night to Grants Grove Village for our lodging. We picked this location because it was a great center point for all we wanted to see and do. The lodging for the four families different areas but so close we all walked the 50 yards to and from the different camp sites. We stayed at the John Muir Lodge, Tent Cabins and Camp Cabins. The Lodge is your basic hotel with an nice cozy gathering area. The Camp Cabins are clean, warm, and the wood burning stove was a must have for our group. The tent cabins were a step above Housekeeping Camp in yosemite and was perfect for the price. The tent cabins also have the nicest showers (compared to the Camp Cabins). Traffic was a breeze arriving and departing the park. I expected overcrowding and long lines since it was Labor Day weekend but it did not happen.We started saturday with a stop at the Lodgepole Visitors Center. Based on the Rangers suggestions we drove to the General Sherman Parking area and did a 5.5 mile hike through the amazing Sequoia forest all the way to Moro Rock. The hike through the forest was beautiful and the kids had a blast. We explored burnt out trees, saw General Sherman (largest tree in the world), Tunnel log, and came across a black bear. We arrived at Moro Rock to follow the cattle call to the top of the rock. It was amazingly beautiful. So worth the trip!! From Moro Rock we were able to take the free shuttle back to our parking area. What a treat! We drove 45 minutes back to our camp sites (there is gasoline in the park!) and cooked dinner and the kids played. On Sunday we drove to Cedar Grove Visitor Center and got some recommendations from the rangers there on what we could do in a day. WHAT A DAY! I could have spent a week in this area. We drive to the Roaring River Falls Parking area. We hiked to the falls (the flow was nice and low) and the kids and a few adults played in the water and on the rocks. This area would be spectacular in the late spring early summer. We then hiked to Zumwalt Meadow. This is the place where you feel like you are in Yosemite. Absolutely breathtaking. You are down at the river level with these granite walls all around you. We then went to Muir Rock. This was the highlight of the trip. Our group was able to jump off Muir Rock into the most beautiful water you have ever seen. We then worked our way back to Grants grove but stopped out at Hume Lake. Glad we stopped but enjoyed being along the river better. Monday morning on our way out we went to Panoramic Point. The road to the point was right in the middle of our camp area. We wish we did this first. It was so beautiful up there. You can see Hume lake and all of Kings Canyon peaks from there. We all want to go back and do it again. On other thing we were pleasantly surprised about was the Grants Grove market. It was very well stocked with reasonable prices!","September 4, 2012",Simply Majestic,5,east bay area,5

Kings Canyon,"We drove from the Grand Canyon to Kings Canyon National Park. The drive was easy until we got on CA 245. That road was so curvy, my oldest daughter felt sick. The road was one sharp turn after another. The roads are truly two lanes only. There were shoulders every once in a while called ""turnouts"". We were either hugging the hills or the edge of the road. It wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't a 50 mile drive that took over 2hrs. The Sequoia's and the Falls were outstanding!!!! Well worth the trip. Our girls thought walking through a hollowed out fallen sequoia was the greatest! Grants Tree was ENORMOUS. We took CA 180 out of the Park to Fresno, CA. That was a lot better drive, less curves and turns. We were going to visit Sequoia National Park the next day but heard that CA 198 was just as bad as CA 245. Needless to say all of us voted on going to the beach instead, we had enough of the winding roads this trip. At least we have some humorous stories to tell.","August 16, 2012",Beautiful Views,12,"Castroville, Texas",4

I camped out on the ground without a tent... sleeping under the stars, Forgot the tent, actually, so I had to be aware of the noises in the campground... heard many, saw nothing because my food was stored in the bear boxes provided in each site.The drive into the Canyon is spectacular but a very steep & winding road, not for the feint of heart driver!!!!","August 15, 2012",Awesome stop ...Midweek,35,Florida,5

Kings Canyon,My wife and did the scenic drive and enjoyed the scenic views. The Geology of the park is very interesting and the park is photogenic. We only had time to do two hikes: one was a short hike to a beautiful falls and the other was in Grants Forest. Grants Forest was very impressive and we love the hollowed out Sequoia that was very historical. The roads have a lot of twists and turns and if you have someone who has difficulty with motion sickness I would consider taking a dramamine.

Kings Canyon,"Most people think they have visited Kings Canyon if they went to the General Grant Tree. The real part of this park this canyon itself which is another 30-45 minute drive in from Grant Grove. There are good views of the canyon from the upper part of the road where it curves before it drops into the valley floor. The valley floor is around 4,000 feet so it is much warmer than the other portions of Kings Canyon and Sequoia. However, as you enter the canyon most of the crowds vanish, This is the least crowded but accessible by vehicle part of Kings Canyon National Park. However, if you really want to explore this part of the park allow an extra day as if you try to fit it in with the rest of Kings Canyon and Sequoia you will need to either get an early start or trim out some stops.

We chose one in Moraine, the ""overflow"" campground and it was quite pleasant. Although we had neighbors we never felt crowded. The river was nearby, and after a short drive we found plenty of firewood. We spent a day in Sequoia looking at the big trees and doing the Crystal Cave tour (highly recommended), the rest of the time we were in Kings Canyon.

Kings Canyon,"We were glad we stayed a second day after Sequoia National Park. If you like mountains, rivers and waterfalls, this is for you. We started by going to Inspiration Point, which is a short drive behind the visitor's center. Ignore the sign in the parking lot about the 2-mile trail. It's a short hike from the lot. The views are inspiring. We then took the short General Grant trail, which is like the Sequoia trails but has some new features. We then headed on the scenic byway. You start off one mile above the river down below. We were so high that we debated whether it was actually a river. It was fun driving down and seeing the scenery from all the different elevation changes. It was beautiful. It took 3.5 hours to get to the end because we stopped so often for photos. We enjoyed both Roaring River Falls and Grizzly Falls (very short hikes). Zumwalt Meadow was OK. There is a cave at the bottom, but we didn't take the tour. It was a much quicker drive out, although we stopped at Hume Lake for milkshakes. It's a three-mile detour but definitely worth it. A park ranger had told us about these hand-made shakes.

Kings Canyon,"Its a weekend trip from bay area to the land of biggest trees. We started at Friday evening and spend the night at Super8, Fresno. I will definitely recommend everyone to stay here, its really cheap but offers all the amenities generally offered by the chain B & B, specially the breakfast is good. The north entrance is around 60 mile from Fresno, though it takes more that an hour to reach there. We started at 7:30 am. We pretty much visited all the places except the southern part of the park and the crystal cave. Other than the big trees, park it self is very scenic. Also, I will suggest to take the shuttle and relax. The park has better bathroom and drinking water facilities but no water in monorock. Take time and climb the rock..you should not miss the view. Monorock shuttle starts from Giant Museum. Go to the crystal meadow by the same shuttle from monorock and do this easy hike. At the end, you will find the log-house, build almost 150 yrs ago! Also, walk a little in Chimney train in crystal meadow area to see the burnt trees. The same day we also covered the Sherman tree trail. We spent the night at our camp site in Lower Stony Creek. It is nice and not noisy, only 49 sites. You should reserve the campsite if comingin weekend or be very early in the morning. Lot of people actually come sequoia for camping. The gas station in Stony Creek Village is the cheapest. Next day morning, we visited Kings Canyon. The trail in General Grant Tree is very nice; specially in the morning breeze. We then went to Hume lake, the road is ..uuu; actually for me the roads in Kings Canyon is scary. The hume lake is ok but the area is crowded. Then we stopped and take the Boyden Cave tour; pretty much liked it. The view of Kings Canyon river is splendid from here. The cave tour is roughly 1 hour. Then we kept driving to the scenic byway and reached at Roaring River Falls. Parking is at your right side, don't miss it, is just after the bridge. Way back, we stopped at Grizzley Falls. You can easily go to the water...and you should do it! Now for us, the tour is almost over.

There's no better place to see giant size trees, huge rock cliffs, roaring rivers and lots animals (especially bears). There is no better place to go camping. In particular, Kings Canyon has some of the most breathtaking views. Your surrounded by these huge granite cliffs on either side. There's a huge river that runs through the canyon that and gets calmer and wider when it gets to the valley (i think its called paradise valley). It's a great place to go swimming and you can take some amazing pictures. Lots of people have been comparing Sequoia and Kings Canyon to Yosemite but I don't think that's right.

Kings Canyon,"The goal behind Kings Canyon was to develop a park that was all about wilderness, and less about park-and-stare. That's not to say that there aren't plenty of places to park and stare, but this is definitely not the park to go if you would rather auto-tour than hike. The main road, 180, is only accessible via winding roads that make even the most sea worthy folks motion sick. There are towering granite monoliths to the right and 2000 foot drop-offs to the left with switchbacks galore until you finally make it to Road's End. This is one of the hubs for wilderness activity in the park, and is also the location of Zumwalt Meadow. I was surprised to find that Zumwalt Meadow is actually more of a marsh rather than a meadow, and I am not sure I would have tried to venture out into the green pasture. I think it was actually prohibited. Nevertheless, the views were awe inspiring, and pictures will never truly do it justice. My buddy and I parked at the Zumwalt Loop trailhead, extended the trip beyond Roads Ends and followed Copper Creek Trail to Mist Falls. The water level was low, according to locals, but was as clear as crystal. At no point during my visit to Kings Canyon do I remember not being able to NOT see the bottom of a stream or river. Mist Falls looked like it was a little low, but still impressive. I think this hike ended up being 12 miles roundtrip from the start of Zumwalt Meadow and back. Nearly everyone we passed on the trail had seen a mother bear and a couple of cubs. We ended up encountering one of the cubs, though he looked to be about 2 years of age and ready to head out on its own. A great experience and certainly the only way to truly appreciate Kings Canyon.

Great Smoky Mountain NP? No way. Yosemite NP? No way. Glacier NP?? Not even close. You can see why we can't give King's Canyon an excellent rating. It is very good in every respect but it does not come close to being a rival to those national parks which offer very similar vistas and so much more. On the other hand the Sequoia part of the park is unique to this region alone, and in our opinion, better than the redwood parks we have seen along our CA travels. The Giant Forest earned excellent marks as did Moro Rock. We would definitely re-visit Sequoia one day but not so sure about the extra drive and re-visit to King's Canyon.

I arrived before noon, and had to wait in line to get my pass into the park. I proceeded on to Grant Grove Village, and found I was just in time to make a Rager led walk through the Grant Grove, so headed that way. The Ranger was an ex-teacher, who was very engaging with our group. In fact, he was so good that people along the way fell in with our group to find out the history and biology behind the Giant Sequoias. By the time I left Kings Canyon at about 2:00 p.m., there was a line of cars backed up down the hill about 3 miles, so I would suggest that you get there early to avoid long lines. Grants Village had a nice welcome center, gift shop and restaurant.

Kings Canyon,"We were traveling from Wisconsin on a 10-night camping trip in Wine Country/Kings Canyon-Sequoia/Yosemite. It was our first visit to the first two, second visit to Yosemite.Our plan was to spend the first night at Cedar Grove, then see what we wanted to do with the other two nights. The campsites are mostly ""first-come"", and prior reviews were accurate in that there were plenty of sites available in the four Cedar Grove campgrounds.First - the drive along the Kings Canyon Scenic Drive is JAW-DROPPING. Those that plan to just visit Sequoia (why??) are missing the boat. Bypass Grant Grove (Snoresville) and take the drive to Cedar Grove. As a prior reviewer wrote, ""it's the road to nowhere - but worth the drive"". Couldn't agree more. Seeing the vast panorama into the Sierra, and the Kings River roaring thousands of feet below...then soon enough being at river-level and looking back UP, is something to behold. We couldn't have been more thrilled to be camping in such a remote location. The sheer cliffs towering above the raging Kings River made for a special visit. We settled on a great campsite (site 23) at Sentinal campground. The site featured a fairly private tent location with a small, babbling mountain stream within earshot. Bathrooms were just across the drive (close proximity for those late-night potty runs, hoping to avoid bears!). The campsites along the Kings River at all 4 campgrounds wbere gorgeous, (thus obviously occupied at all times). I did assist in chasing a bear out of Sentinal camprgound one night, but bears were not a problem overall. Use your bear box! The bear was very timid and high-tailed it out of there once we started making noise and shining a light on it..We did the popular Mist Falls hike and were very pleased with it. The views are simply spectacular (and on-par with Yosemite) once you climb out of the canyon. The falls were fairly anti-climactic (especially if you're familiar with Yosemite). Several other hikers told of a bear on the trail and in the river, but we never saw it. Another group told of a coral snake alongside the trail...but again, even our keen eyes didn't see it.The Cedar Grove store was nowhere near as stocked as Lodgepole, but sold most everything you'd need. We were very impressed with the reasonable prices on groceries, beer, wine and booze. As we were flying in and out and camping every night on our 10-night stay, we relied on our large styrofoam cooler from Wal*Mart for food storage. Thus, we needed groceries often.Cedar Grove offers showering facilities for $5 for 10 minutes of shower time. I'm glad we chose to spend 2 nights in Cedar Grove. The spectacular setting was far-and-away superior to the night we spent at Lodgepole in Sequoia. What a ho-hum campground. Very not-private, very boring. The only highlight for me was camping at 7,000-plus feet of elevation. Easily the highest place we've ever laid our heads to sleep.Lodgepole store was very nice. Brand new and well-stocked. Showers at Lodgepole were also $5 for 10 minutes of shower time.Moro Rock was worth the time. General Sherman tree was ok...however the walk out kinda sucked. The sequoias were neat to see, but very much ""ho-hum"" after the spector of Kings Canyon.","September 12, 2011",Amazing Kings Canyon - Boring Sequoia,106,"Eau Claire, Wisconsin",5
Kings Canyon,"Do your homework and plan your visit. There are many things to do and see. Go early in the morning while its still slow so you'll have the place to yourself. Make a check list of all the things you want to do and see that way you won't miss a thing. It's very easy to get side track. I recommend visiting Grizzly Falls its a very scenic drive to get there and stop by the riverside and get your feet wet. Be careful the torrent is very powerful just stay by the side and be safe, the water is also cold. Don't let little kids in. You can choose to ride the shuttle to get to Moro Rock but its better to drive if it's not busy so you can drive your car under a giant fallen tree! Take the shuttle to General Sherman. If you drive the parking lot is a pretty long hike to the General Sherman Tree.","September 12, 2011",Natures wonders you must see!,57,"Vallejo, California",5
Kings Canyon,"We visited the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National park for the labor day weekend. I did not have a lot of expectations, but the trip turned out to be great. We were in the parks for hardly two days as we had to return quick. We stayed at the Montecito resort in the Sequoia national forest and it was convenient to cover many of the parks attractions. Day 1 - Giant Forest Museum - Amazed by the Giant Trees. Great - Moro Rock - A must visit and a must hike. The view of the great western divide is superb. Try to go early or late in the day. Avoid harsh sunlight as it goofs up your photos. - Tunnel Log - If u are going on a weekend, the chance to drive your car through the tunnel will be less. Else it is good. - General Sherman Tree - What a huge tree... take some good photos.Day 2 - Kings Canyon What to say, the drive to the Cedar Grove and Roads end itself is breath taking and worth it. After a point you get the Kings river for company which makes it even more awesome. Grizzly falls and the Roaring river falls are great and just a short walk from the parking lot. Zumwalt meadows is a must see. The view of the river and the mountain backdrop is second to none. On the way back paid a visit to the nations Christmas tree (General Grant).If you are a hiker, there is lot more to do and see.

We stayed in two different lodges. They were rustic and not very sound proof. But, that is easily forgiven when you walk outside. I can't find words to describe the grandeur. The hiking trails are wonderful and there are several easy walks that are rewarded with outstanding sights. The Kings River in front of our lodge in Cedar Grove is a mighty, powerful river that is spectacular in its beauty.

Don't expect resort lodging, but there are a motel, cabins, and campgrounds, with restaurants, stores, Visitor Center, and P.O. There is no gas station in the Park.We always read the Parks newspaper and attend ranger-led activities. This time we heard a nice talk at the General Grant Tree, an astronomy talk at the Visitors Center, took a meadow stroll with a Park naturalist, and went to the campfire program. Doing things with rangers always makes the visit more enjoyable.Plan enough time to drive down the canyon to Cedar Grove. On the way there are a couple of nice waterfalls and there is an excellent easy trail around Zumwalt Meadow. If you like caves, stop and tour Boyden Cave.

My family with 2 kids and another friend's family, also with 2 kids, stayed in a hotel inside the park the first time, and figured we would camp this time. However, the few campgrounds that can be reserved are booked way ahead of time, and so we took a chance that we could get a camping spot on arrival on Sat. morning. Of course, all the NPS camps were full by Friday evening, and we were not ready for the more primitive camping available through the National Forest Service. Luckily, a cabin for eight was available and we were happy to spend the weekend within the park. You can read about the big trees, hiking trails, lakes and rivers in others' reviews -- suffice it to say that Kings Canyon and Sequoia offer the natural beauty of Yosemite without as much of the crowds.

Kings Canyon,"If you visit the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park be sure to take at least one day and take the whole day tour from Sequoia Sightseeing Tours located in Three Rivers CA. Their website is: www.sequoiatours.com. Our tour guide Stephanie was the greatest. The tours are a small enough group so as to have a personal feel. Stephanie teaches you a lot about the giant Sequoia trees while also knowing where to take you in the park. She will even let you ""taste"" a Sequoia Tree. Also the road up from Three Rivers is under construction and closes for an hour at a time to traffic. On the top of the hour they let you through, and Stephanie knew just how to time it so as not to get us stuck in the traffic jam! You have time on your own, lunch up at the visitors center, and get to climb Moro Rock to the top if you dare! The tour picks you up about 8:00AM and gets you back about 4:30 to 5:00PM.

Kings Canyon,"We stayed at the Cedar Grove Lodge. A little funky looking when you first arrive, but it's the only ""lodging"" option right in the heart of Kings Canyon, and it's like ""The Little Engine That Could"" of little National Park Lodges. Our room might have looked right out of the 70's, but it was VERY clean, the bed was VERY comfortable, great shower. Couldn't have asked for more for such a low price, and I really was happy not to be camping on the ground that night. The people who work there really seem to take a lot of pride in their little lodge, and they work hard running the market and snack bar that are the only services available to hundreds of campers coming through the area. Oh, and would you believe FREE Wi-Fi? Okay, that was unexpected. Kings Canyon has beautiful local hiking and also serves as the gateway to the backcountry. It's worth the drive, and even though Sequoia never really gets that crowded (any anything you think you might complain about a small crowd... remember how much worse it would be if you were in Yosemite...) and in Kings Canyon we hardly saw a soul once we were out on the trails.","August 10, 2011",Unexpected little gem,21,"Menlo Park, California",5

Kings Canyon,"Cedar Grove in King's Canyon is on the way to nowhere, but it's worth the trip. I personally find the canyon more spectacular than Grand Canyon, because you're driving through high granite walls with a powerfully raging river off to your side. The views are amazing! The river is so treacherous, you stand in awe.I've camped at Canyon View campground in a group site and it was very nice (although a little more primitive). Flush toilets and great view of river a little behind our campsite (75 feet down). No electric outlets to be found apart from the village. They have trails that connect all four campgrounds in Cedar Grove, but the bridge was out to the village for construction. The Visitor's Center and amphitheater was right there at Sentinel Campground.Definitely check out Roaring River Falls. Between that and the Kings Rivers (south fork after Roaring River joins it), water is doing things that water shouldn't do. Magnificent and violent collisions with rocks & trees. BTW, don't get into the water. Zumwult Meadow is a beautiful 1.5 mile loop and we hiked 9 young children (ages 5-12) from Roaring River Falls to the meadow which is about 2 miles.Most of the other hikes end up climbing out of the canyon, so elevation gain is to be expected, but if there is one must-do in Cedar Grove it's the 4.4 mile loop hike from Zumwult Meadow (or Road's End) to Bailey Bridge. A very flat trail with multiple creek crossing, over the Kings River on Bailey Bridge. Some of the creek crossings were tricky with my 7 year old daughter (it was snowing and raining), but at the very worse I would have gotten my feet wet to my shins carrying her across.As much as I wanted to see a bear, I didn't get to see one. The national park staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. We had spots reserved at Lodgepole, but they switched us to Cedar Grove due to snow on Memorial Day Weekend. Call the visitor's center if you have questions and they can even connect you with a campground host for more information.","July 5, 2011","Amazing Canyon, Amazing River!",69,"Sacramento, California",5
Kings Canyon,"Majestic yet intimate. Awe inspiring ancient monarchs of Sequoias, gorgeous meadows, vast views and rushing rivers that make one aware of what a mere single breath is all of ones time on Earth, and what a gift is life in this moment. This is a sacred place. Others have given this amazing place well earned praise and posted lovely photos too. So I'll just say ""GO"" and focus this review on a couple of areas you might find helpful if you do. First, information traffic delays that will be ongoing though the 2011 season. Second, a ""heads up"" on a public transit alternative out of Visalia. Third, some references for accessibility.ROAD / TRAFFIC DELAYS: Road projects through the 2011 season will delay traffic in between the Ash Mountain entrance and Giant Forest Museum. I included a couple of photos for reference. (Hope they post, seem to have trouble with TA photo adds at times.) During our visit in mid June the work encompassed about three miles of road. The protocol seemed to be to open the northbound lane on the hour every hour and allow traffic into the park for what seemed about 30 minutes. Then to reverse that southbound on the half hour. That the road crew could work with all the traffic filing by is incredible. In addition to road upgrades looks like they're constructing a turnout with a stunning view of Moro Rock. We were impressed with how easily navigable is the road, what good turnouts there are in many places, and the quality and extent of the rock walls along side. Good roads made it delightful drive and the slower pace of line of traffic in allowed more time to enjoy the vistas. Since you climb roughly 500 feet per mile as you travel into the park, the change in topography and flora is astounding and you see that more specifically at the slow traffic pace. Using that as perspective, we weren't flummoxed by the road delays. If you might be, you may want to wait until 2012 to visit. Or leave the driving to others as below. PUBLIC TRANSPORT ALTERNATIVE: A summer shuttle (late May - Sept) runs from Visalia to the Giant Forest Museum where riders can connect with NPS shuttle service to and from various points within the park. Fee is $15 total and includes park entrance. You may need reservations. Check details at http://www.sequoiashut.... PARK ACCESSIBILITY FOR ALL: The parks district has a page on accessible locations and facilities on their web site. You can find it at this URL. http://www.nps.gov/sek... I pay attention because I have MS and while still ambulatory (after better than 30 years of living with the disease), that status is with difficulty and I use a wheelchair for longer distances. Like navigating a national park, which is one of my favorite things to do. Sequoia gets high marks for the wide, paved levels 1 and 2 trails. As much as slope is Nature's work and some of the slopes were steep the cross slopes, which are very much Man's work in installing trails, seemed easily the 2% or less required to be considered level. Anyone who has used a wheelchair or a cane or crutches will know how important is level cross slope. So will anyone who has pushed a stroller. Well done here. My favorite trails for a newbie first time visitor and all easily accessible for people of all ages and physical abilities were... ...the Big Trees Trail around Round Meadow and where we saw both black and brown bears. Access is via a longish path downhill from the Giant Forest Museum. Two things to note: 1) a designated Disabled Parking lot is adjacent to the trail and 2) in mid June there was snow on parts of this trail so plan a later season visit if snow is a problem for you. ...the General Sherman tree trail. The most accessible portion of this trail goes uphill from a parking area / drop off point opened last fall. (Lots of tour buses here.) The trail goes higher past General Sherman through the 2 mile paved Congress Grove with steeper slopes for longer distance and magnificent trees. ...the General Grant tree trail. Easily accessible but with some steeper slopes for short distances. A lovely stroll through magnificent Sequoias whether one does it on feet or wheels. Ahhhhhsome! Accessible bathrooms were everywhere throughout the park. Thumbs up. Great benches sited along the trails throughout the park, where people could rest and reflect on the majesty. Universally usable, and seemed to be particularly attractive to people at both ends of age spectrum - the very young and the aged. Cool. Life is short.

Kings Canyon,"My wife and I visited Sequoia National Park for a couple days of hiking and viewing the sequoia trees. As usual, we were not disappointed by our experience in the national park. The forests are spectacular and the sequoia trees are truly a wonder of nature. We stayed at the Wuksachi Lodge in the park so that we would be close to the hiking trails and could get an earlier start each day. The Lodge was nice and a definite recommendation. You definitely want a camera and sturdy hiking shoes. Our favorite hike was up to Moro Rock, an enormous granite monolith that has spectacular views from its top. The hike up was a bit arduous so be prepared to walk up about 400 stairs and pass some spots where the guardrail is discontinuous. The climb is well worth the effort. We also spent half a day in the foothills, hiking along the river and that was fun. The foothills area was about 30 degrees warmer than up on the mountain and was much more humid. The one complaint we had about the park is that we didn't find out until we got there that there was still 4-6 ft of snow on many trails, making them rather inaccessible. It would be nice if the park rangers would post conditions on their website. Also, some services (e.g. museums, snack bars) were not operational during the first week in May although the website said that everything was officially open on May 1. Oh well, we made due with what they had and had a blast. We were there for one day and a half and we wished we would have spent another day there so that we could have driven up in the King's Canyon part of the park. If we go again, we will want to see that for sure. Have fun!","June 13, 2011","Visit to Sequoia National Park, California",176,"Annapolis, Maryland",5
Kings Canyon,"When I visit my daughter and her husband in California (San Francisco area) we always spend some time camping. Last year was Yosemite so this time we went to Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park for 4 days. We stayed at the Azalea campgrounds, not far from the visitor center, which also had a market and restaurant (great breakfast). True to it's reputation, it was much less crowded than Yosemite during our early September visit. Overall, it is much more of a true forest experience rather than one of scenic mountain vistas, with the possible exception of Moro Rock. The semi climb/hike up to the top is made up of a steep incline both natural and partially constructed all the way to the top where you have a magnificent 360 degree view. The tour of Crystal Cave is also worth your time. The hike down to the cave, the tour itself and the hike back up to the parking lot is about 3 hours total. Of course we saw the main attractions, General Grant and General Sherman trees but we also spent a good deal of time exploring and hiking. Bring clothes suitable for 80 degree days and 40 degrees or lower at night. Was a great way to celebrate my daughter's 37th birthday.","June 13, 2011",Forest at it's Best,9,"Montague, NJ",5

I think we pulled over on all the turnouts (could not risk missing something).  Along the way you will see waterfalls,canyons , cliffs as high as the sky in some places. There are wild flowers and rivers and streams. If you go all the way to the bottom, you will be rewarded with wonderful meadow walks and the views up.

I am so glad we did this as although you can park about 500 yards away from the actual tree, you miss out on so much! On our journey up we saw a brown bear cub foraging for food.

Kings Canyon,"This somewhat obscure Park is absolutely gorgeous and well worth a day or two if you're visiting Sequoia National Park. But Kings Canyon is also typical of some of the failings of the Park Service. Both in its website and hand-out printed park guides, the Park Service just doesn't do a very good job of promoting anything but the ""greatest hits"" aspects of its parks. At Sequoia NP you'll never get lost looking for the Grant or Sherman trees, or for one of the drive-up scenic overlooks. But if you're looking for a hiking trail away from the crowds, a particular kind of bird habitat, or a unique geologic of botanical feature, you're pretty much left to your own devices.Crater Lake NP has done a good job with this by adding a small newspaper-style handout to its glossy visitors map ... telling visitors about what's going on currently at the Park aside from the standard tourist attractions. But it seems to me a lot more content could be added to each Park's website. along with a good internal search engine.

Kings Canyon, an adjoining park, is also breathtaking with its soaring granite peaks and lush meadows. The Kings River is a spectacular site as well. If you're planning on staying in the parks, make plans well in advance or else be prepared to drive outside the parks for accommodations. Food sold in the parks is very expensive (of course) so it might be wise to pack a lunch before going. And take the bear warning signs seriously. I did see a bear with two cubs in Sequoia which was very cool.One down side was the road work being done in the park had traffic jammed up for 45 minutes! Another work related jam lasted 10 minutes.

Kings Canyon,"I read that conservationist John Muir wrote that Kings Canyon was, ""a rival to the Yosemite."" Sorry John, simply not true. Yes, it is spectacular, but there is nothing to compare to Half Dome or El Capitan or Glacier Point or Yosemite's stunning waterfalls.I began my visit by taking the Generals Highway from Sequoia NP, which is a pretty good road, but with not many vistas of the Sierra Nevada, which is a little disappointing. I stopped to explore the grove of sequoias around the General Grant Tree. An easy walk (compared to the grove over in Sequoia NP where General Sherman is located). If you can only do one forest walk, perhaps this is the better choice for that reason.Then on into Kings Canyon itself. What a road! Pay attention driving! But it's a pretty good highway through spectacular scenery. Be sure to stop at two of the waterfalls -- Roaring River and Grizzly. It was May when I was there and both were still very powerful from spring snow-melt, with only short walks required. Be sure to stop along the highway to enjoy the rapids of the Kings River and take some photos of the bedrock valley.Although I was returning to my hotel in Three Rivers (near the entrance to Sequoia NP), I went out of my way to avoid that park's tortuous entrance road. I exited Kings Canyon NP along route 180 and then drove over route 63 to route 198. 180 is sooooo much better than 198...I recommend you connect with Sequoia NP through Kings Canyon via the Generals Highway.","May 18, 2009",My First Foray Into Kings Canyon,272,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5

The visitor centers are well spaced and offer a nice view overview of the park. The grocery store at lodgepole village has a good assortment of food, supplies and souvenirs. The General Sherman tree and the Big Trees Trail are both outstanding. If you drive up California hwy 198 from the southwest be prepared for construction delays and a narrow, winding and steep road. The road to Cedar Grove Village is also winding with sheer drop offs.","June 7, 2007",unbelievable trees,27,"Clayton, NC",5
