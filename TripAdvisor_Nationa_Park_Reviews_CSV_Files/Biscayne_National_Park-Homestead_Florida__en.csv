Biscayne National Park,"We took the Boca Chita boat tour at 10 am. We love the tour, very interesting the history of the park. Boca Chita is beautifull. You can take your food and lunch there. There is a little beach on the island. We love the lighthouse (without light) and the ride in boat.Very relaxing. We are local and we are planning do more of the park tours.","September 8, 2019",Spectacular!!,1,,5

Biscayne National Park,"Biscayne national park is a beautifully conserve natural park where 95% of it is over water and the other 5% it’s mainly small islands scatter through the park. It will allow you to do scuba diving or snorkeling in shipwrecks that serves as home for thousands of marine species. You can kayak and paddle board too! We use Biscayne national park institute, a nonprofit organization that provides boat tours in the park and the experience was fantastic. I will definitely do it again in the future with family and friends. ","August 17, 2019",A great way to be with marine ecosystems near Miami ,7,"North Richland Hills, TX",5
Biscayne National Park,The first time we went to the Visitors Center we were welcomed by three iguanas. We bought tickets to take a boat tour for the next day.

Biscayne National Park,"I try to visit once a week. When my trucker son gets off the road every 4 week for 6 days. He's going to this park. On a very clear day you can see Miami across the bay. Its family friendly, plenty places to sit. If want you can even grill.It would be very easy to spend the whole day out there. They have different events that are informative and fun. If you like to fish you can do that to. Sometimes you can rent kayaks. ","August 13, 2019",Beath the ocean air,9,"Homestead, Florida",5
Biscayne National Park,"We really enjoyed the half day snorkeling tour as a great way to explore this beautiful area. Due to weather conditions, we were not able to go to the reef but explored the keys opposite the mainland, what we reached via Zodiac in approx. 30 minutes. For experienced 'divers' probably not so attractive, it was the perfect trip for us as 'beginners'. Both the ranger at the start of the program as well as the people on the zodiac explained the area and were very friendly. A good family experience for sure!","August 12, 2019","Snorkeling, also for beginners",85,"Schaffhausen, Switzerland",4
Biscayne National Park,"A certain calm comes over you when you visit this subtropical national park just south of Miami. The shallow bay is dotted with little islands and keys. Mangroves line the shoreline. Wildlife is abundant. I wish we could have taken the boat ride to observe nature's beauty close-up. Instead we appreciated the simple beauty of this tranquil park. Just sitting on the bench watching the clouds pass overhead made for a lasting memory. Linger a while, relax and appreciate the beauty of Biscayne National Park.","August 11, 2019",Serene and beautiful setting,44,"Easton, Pennsylvania",5
Biscayne National Park,"Alas due to time, we could only go to the Dante Fascell Visitor Center and not take a boat ride or do other water events. The orientation movie is very good to get a sense of the importance of this park. The Visitor Center exhibits are quite worthwhile. The rangers and volunteers are very helpful. The Junior Ranger for Biscayne is part of the Everglades and Big Cypress booklet. Each National Park has their own badge. Completion of all 3 earns a very special patch.Even just going to the Visitor Center is worthwhile; views are stunning.","August 5, 2019",Good movie at Visitor Center,548,"Dallas, Texas",5

Biscayne National Park,"Based on the peaceful lack of people, I wonder if the residents of Miami know this gem is just to the south. It’s more tucked away than we expected, and it seemed ironic that the route took us right past a landfill, but the park is amazing. We did not have time for a boat tour or snorkeling on this trip, but the areas around the visitor’s center are beautiful. We hope to make it back someday for some snorkeling.","July 24, 2019",Beautiful area just south of Miami,27,"Arlington, Texas",5
Biscayne National Park,"We half heartedly cruised down here during our visit to Ft Lauderdale to basically check it off our National Park list. And then.....So many positives to this place. First of all even though it was cloudy and rainy on the drive down, the weather cleared for us long enough to enjoy the places we could get to without a boat. 95% water makes it seem essential to pay for a boat trip but you don't HAVE to. Since this Park is free admission you see lots of picnicking and fishing and of course boating. Many people say you have to get on a boat to enjoy the Park however we didn't and still found plenty to keep us interested. Nice variety of plants and trees, fish, coral and fossils, crabs, lizards as well as beautiful views of the water and islands nearby. Because of the weather the water was basically empty resulting in unspoiled views and peaceful serenity. A small, easy trail along the water is suitable for all ages and has no hills or obstacles. We took a few hours to enjoy this park and never got on a boat. I can imagine it is twice as lovely on nicer days and has even more to explore via boat. Next time we will do that. So glad we went.","July 7, 2019",Great for Nature lovers,10,"Nashville, Tennessee",5
Biscayne National Park,"We visited last year, and here we are again amazed by this place. The park is free admission. They have a cancellation stamp. They have a jetty that goes out into the bay, an overlook, a theatre with videos, exhibits, picnic tables, and endless activities that you can do (for a fee).Bob, the ranger on duty today, was extremely nice and well acquainted with the park (I believe that he said that he has been there for 35 years!). My only regret is that we couldn’t do more of the water activities. We did the lighthouse tour this year, but kayaks are available for rent, a snorkeling tour is available, and many other choices. This park could be a destination in itself. ","June 30, 2019",The 8th Wonder,27,"Jacksonville, Florida",5

Bryce sailed us out to Adams Key where we at a lunch we brought. The kids helped hoist the sales. Then we went paddle boarding and saw a good assortment of fish and starfish. We snorkeled mangrove patches. Then we had a relaxing sale back. I would recommend this for any group of six or fewer. It wasVery nice and private. No crowdOn Memorial Day. Highly recommend.

Biscayne National Park,"On the last day in Florida and with a small amount of time, we decided to visit the Biscayne National Park HQ visitor office. IT was unanimous, we should have made the visit to the Park earlier in our vacation and spent a full day. There were great tours to try at the National Park (snorkeling at ship wrecks and reefs, fishing and kayaking through the mangroves). The event that made the park memorable and great was a sighting of a manatee. With the help of Ranger Stephanie, she spotted a manatee and alerted us to the sighting. This was beyond the call of duty and we wanted to thank her for the memorable moment.","April 29, 2019",Quite the unexpected guest at the Biscayne National Park Dante Fascell Visitor Center.,12,"Maui, Hawaii",5
Biscayne National Park,"This national park was a lot different than most USA national parks. 95% of it is water so the main activities center around the ocean. There are opportunities to take boat tours, snorkel, Kayak, bird watch, scuba dive and so much more. We took a boat tour from the Dante Fascell Visitor Center which took us out to Boca Chita Key! Very cool experience and we even got to see some Manatees!

Biscayne National Park,"We are avid national park visitors and we are lucky to live only 30 minutes from this one. The park has a non-profit institute associated with that offers various tours at reasonable rates. The park itself is 95% water, so I highly recommend taking a tour. We did a paddle board tour and it was a lot of fun. Since it is nature, you cannot be guaranteed to see anything in particular... but paddling through the mangroves is relaxing. We were able to see a nurse shark, coral, and some jelly fish in addition to the numerous birds. You can rent kayaks and other equipment from the park and do your own ""tour"" also. There are some areas that you cannot reach without a motor powered boat. I am looking forward to going back to the park and experiencing some of the other tours offered by the institute. Our tour guides were friendly and knowledgable. I would definitely do the Jones Lagoon paddle board tour again. I highly recommend visiting the park!","April 23, 2019","Book a tour through the Biscayne National Park Institute, it's worth it!",30,United States,5
Biscayne National Park,"Biscayne national park covers a bit of the Florida coast and several of the northern keys off shore, but most of the park is in Biscayne Bay between coast and keys and out to the reefs past the keys. The visitor center has relatively small exhibits on the shoreline to reef ecosystems, a picnic area, a walkway out into the bay, and the usual store. The main things to at Biscayne Bay are renting boats or taking tour boats out to visit the islands or to go snorkeling.We did the 10 am snorkeling tour. It was a bit more expensive than snorkel trips out of Key Largo. They go to different places depending on the weather, either to the reef, to shipwrecks or to the inner edge of the key. It was windy, so we went to the inner side of the key. The area is a nursery for the reef fish so you see smaller versions of the reef fish, such as grunts, wrasse, and barracuda especially among the roots of the mangrove right near the shore. It is not as impressive as a reef, but it was still decent snorkeling. We snorkeled for an hour and a half. The crew of two gave helpful snorkeling advice, talked about the park, helped identify fish, and never asked ""are you having fun yet?""","April 22, 2019",A different type of water park,17,,4
Biscayne National Park,"I took my 10 year old niece to Biscayne National Park and we went on the Eco Adventure Paddle and snorkel day trip and we had an amazing time. We took a small boat from the visitor center with one couple so we had an almost private tour. After a great boat ride we stopped in the mangroves to paddleboard. The shallow waters were alive with fish, and juvenile shark as well as rays and jelly fish. We learned a ton from our guide and enjoyed laying low to get through the mangrove tunnels. After a few hours in the shallow waters we went back in the boat to a reef to snorkel. My niece was a bit scared but we took it slow and saw tons of fish. A day later she was asking to go back and do it again. ","April 15, 2019",Eco Adventure Day Trip,61,"Los Angeles, California",5

The trip was a phenomenal with being on water for several hours but I have to say the Captain definitely took it to a next level. Cap. Jesse was a very knowledgeable not just the history but also all the ecology of the National Park.

We did two 3 hour trips --- I would have done one full day instead. Both boat trips were with a very small group (6 and 10) which was great. Biscayne is all about being on/in the water.

Biscayne National Park,"We are a family of four with two younger children (age 9, 11). We have visited numerous national parks and this was one very unique. Being that it is mostly underwater you have to explore to experience the park best. We took the Boca Chita island trip. The trip out to the island took 45 min so you are really only on the island briefly - maybe 30 min. Im glad we didn’t camp because Boca Chita was packed and loud from day trippers/locals. Yikes. So much noise pollution at a beautiful spot. I would recommend going on one of the snorkeling or kayaking tours. Probably a better way to spend your time and money. The visitors center, rangers, and tour guide were all fantastic. ","March 25, 2019",Fun for a day,12,,4

We toured among the mangroves, into a canal, and out across the bay. We saw wading birds and crabs in the mangroves and fish, including rays and juvenile barracuda, swimming the clear water. After the paddle, we even got to see a mama manatee and her baby at the dock by the visitor center.

Biscayne National Park,"I was surprised at how quiet this park was, even on a Saturday in March, given its proximity to Miami and the lack of an entrance fee. The visitor center was nice, as was the walk over the boardwalk bridge and the trail to the point--both are stroller accessible. My husband and I spent 1-1/2 days visiting the park. The first morning we took the Mangroves and Sea Grass Field paddle which was relaxing and enjoyable. My husband and I were in kayaks, while the other family on the tour were in a canoe as there was a child in the group. Other than my husband, we weren't terribly experienced paddlers but we had no problems as the water was calm and our guide set a nice pace. He was a local and very knowledgeable about the area and the ecosystem. We paddled into the mangroves and then out to a small key and the channel to view the birds--no manatees on this trip.The second day we took the 6 hour Sail, Paddle, Snorkel and Island visit, which was my husband's favorite day of our vacation. We sailed (and motored because it wasn't very windy) out to Adams Key, where our very capable guide docked the sailboat. The sailboat accommodates 6, so it wasn't a big group. We disembarked for lunch (BYO, and the picnic tables were shaded), and then broke out the paddle boards. Being somewhat clumsy, I wasn't planning on partaking in this activity, but I'm glad I did. After failing miserably trying to get on the paddle board from the boat (if you're short opt for using the ladder), I found paddling on my knees (I did not attempt to stand) fairly easy. Our guide took us back into the mangroves, where it was calm for both paddling and snorkeling. If you've never snorkeled before, this is a good place to start because it is calm and shallow, and there is NO CORAL so you don't have to worry about touching it. So why would you snorkel with no coral? Fish--with enough variety to keep it interesting.After about two hours off the boat, we packed up and sailed/motored back to the visitor center. All in all, it was a great day.","March 14, 2019",Serene . . .,3,"Victor, New York",5

Biscayne National Park,"I've been snorkeling before in Mexico and saw so many colorful beautiful fish. The boat ride with Biscayne was fun, but I was expecting it to be like what I experienced in Mexico. We paid $152 for 2 people for Biscayne. The entire area they took us to was completely blah and dead, the same yellow color everywhere. We saw a few fish. Not colorful. Disappointing.

Captain Michelle and David were very knowledgeable and insightful on the history of the park and best places to snorkel. We had a group of 13 people. In a couple of feet of water, the edge of the mangrove held a plethora of juvenile fish. We spent over an hour exploring the little mangrove cove and hardly ran into another person.

However, the wind wasn't great for sailing, but the captain (Evan) put the sails up anyway so we could experience it & it was very enjoyable. We paddled through the mangroves by Adam's Key which was very cool. The snorkeling was ok. It was pretty clear but we were in the bay and not in the ocean by the coral reef so the water wasn't as clear and blue; it's more green in the bay. We snorkeled the coral reef in Key Largo the next day (John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park) and found it be a much better snorkeling experience. Overall, it's an awesome tour. Just remember wind is great for sailing, not so much for paddling or snorkeling.","November 1, 2018","Sail, Paddle, and Snorkel tour",3,,5

The water is so clear and the variety of fish etc is terrific.We rented gear from them - very reasonably priced and worked just fine. After the snorkel, you head on over to one of the small islands for lunch (it is bring your own. We picked-up sandwiches from La Sandwicherie in Miami Beach). After lunch, we headed into the Mangroves for a paddle board tour. It's a wonderful full day out on the water. There is some shade on the boat but of course, you still need sunscreen.

This was plenty of time for a trip around the mangroves, to a close island (we stopped and ate sandwiches there) and down the canal. PRO TIP: take a grocery or trash bag and stop along the shore somewhere. Fill the bag with washed up garbage (there is SO much) and take it back ashore to be disposed of properly.

Biscayne National Park,"Biscayne National Park is 95% water, consisting of islands, coves and lagoons in Biscayne Bay. We spent a day -- my wife's birthday -- in the park, beginning with a stand-up paddleboard tour of Jones Lagoon. It turned out to be a private tour -- we were the only two who signed up on this one, so we had a nice boat ride from the visitors center out to the lagoon with our captain and SUP guide. Then we had the lagoon to ourselves -- with the exception of a private boat of sport fishermen anchored near ours, but once we hit the water, our guide led us in the other direction. We spent a couple hours paddling waters as shallow as 2 feet and only as deep as about 6, yet still clear enough to see the rays swimming beneath us and the sponges undulating in the current. We laid flat to slide beneath stands of mangroves, paddling with our hands, winding through this forest on the water. Our guide kept his bearings, leading us back to our boat when we had no clue of which way we'd gone.Back at the visitors' center, my wife and I got our lunch out of the car and ate at a picnic table near the docks until our afternoon trip across the bay to Boca Chita Key. It was a guided tour with a ranger (and another boat captain) and a few dozen other visitors. Once on Boca Chita -- the former private resort of Mark Honeywell, the air conditioning magnate -- the ranger opened the ornamental lighthouse, allowing us to climb up for a higher view of the key and the bay. We saw a manatee swimming below us. Then we walked the perimeter of the island, taking pictures and looking at the remaining structures -- as well as some beached skiffs used by Cubans who had crossed the Atlantic and reached U.S. shores. Boca Chita Key is open to the public, and the small harbor was filled with private boats that had carried families over for the day. It was another unique national parks experience led by a personable and engaging ranger.","June 12, 2018",Get on the water,14,"Clifton, New Jersey",5

There's a room with all sorts of descriptive displays about the Park (which is 95% underwater). And there's a nice little video (a must stop at every Park). The video is pretty educational telling about the four climes in the Park. Was interesting.Outside the Visitor Center is a trail, boardwalk and path that skirt the ocean and goes onto a spit that juts out into the bay.

Biscayne National Park,"It's free! And easy access from Miami --we drove straight from the airport to pick-up information for all of the Florida National Parks. There are several nice picnic spots and we saw a ""free tour bus"" stop on it's rounds for area tourist spots. We were informed this runs in the ""off season"" months. The staff and volunteers were very helpful. We perused the natural history museum of the area - 15 minutes will do. It was surprisingly quiet and relaxing and devoid of people, for being so near a populous urban center. We had planned to kayak or canoe, but the wind picked up and they weren't allowing boats out on the water. My biggest tip is: check the weather/wind and go early in the day if the weather is accommodating. Our third trip we got out on the water in a boat! It's a leisurely 1 hour (or less) paddle out to a string of islands and back into inlets of the mangroves. Wildlife birds like Herons and Ausprey so close! It was so relaxing and inspiring. However, to paddle out to the actual reef really isn't doable or allowed in a rental boat, it would require a tour boat ride. There is also a nice snorkeling boat option we considered, but it did not work into our plans. We decided to snorkel down during our Tortugas Natl Park trip instead. We did not spot a manatee here, but they sometimes do. We did see several manatees down at Everglades Natl Park (at the Flamingo visitor center). A nice harbor where boats can pull up too! We happened to be there on a ""family event day"" and there were still plenty of boats for more than 20 people to be out on the water at one time without feeling crowded. I highly recommend this park to get out on the water and paddle! Bring your own water bottle, they have nice water fountains to fill it.

Allow about an hour before your boat tour to check out the video, displays and look around at the gift shop. I’ve been collecting post cards with the passport stamps of national parks and this one has two lighthouse stamps, a date/location stamp and anniversary stamp. Also, allow time to change into your swimsuit and fill up your water bottle at the filling station before your tour. The tour lasts about 2.5 hours from the time of orientation to time heading to your snorkeling spot and back. Be sure to wear sunblock, a towel and bring a long sleeve top or sweatshirt as it’s cooler on the water, especially after being wet. We snorkeled for about an hour. I’ve been snorkeling quite a few times, but I saw a few new fish and another barracuda. The coral and sea fans are much larger and in more abundance here than anywhere else I’ve been. Gear is provided, but some on our tour brought their own equipment. I suggest you buy tickets for your tour in advance online and check in at the gift shop next to the visitors center. There are picnic tables, waterfront areas to walk around and camping is available. I spotted several motor homes in the visitor center parking lot and the video shows tent campers.

I highly recommend you plan ahead and book a boat tour to really experience the park. We booked the Adam's Key paddleboat tour through the Biscayne Insitute. We got lucky because we were actually there during the government shutdown but that didn't apply to Institute tours. We took a zodiac style boat out to Adam's Key. The boat driver and guide on the boat were both very informative and entertaining. Once we arrived at the key we were dropped off with the paddle board guide while the rest of the boat went onto the snorkeling expedition. We had an amazing time paddleboarding. The area was beatiful and the mangrove tunnel was spectacular. It was a little breezing on our way out which basically made it impossible to s tand-up but once we got to a more enclosed area we were fine. My only compalint is that our guide didn't really guide us. He really just paddled with us and told us where to go. I would've like more commentary on the ecosystem and the history of the area.

Nice picnic grounds, right on the water, accessible and friendly to the public. It isn't a large gift shop but, on the other hand, the rangers are very informative and the personnel will go out of their way to talk to you. Bring a family lunch. Eat next to the ocean.

Biscayne National Park,"First of all, let me say that I went to Biscayne knowing that most of the park is underwater. That said, there are many photos associated with Biscayne that show a beach. My sister and I went for the beach only to be told by the park staff that there are no beaches at Biscayne. We already had plans to go diving and do an ocean boat tour at another park, so that left very little for us to do. The park and those promoting it need to be very clear that there is no beach on the property, and stop using photos that indicate otherwise.","January 13, 2018",Bad Advertising,14,"Madison, Wisconsin",2

Biscayne National Park,The road trip to the Park did not prepare me for the magnificent experience I had. After traveling through residential areas I started to see huge palm plantations with many varieties in neat rows. Next came the roadside groves of mangroves and finally the entrance to the park. Initially I was not impressed but then I viewed the vast area of coral reefs and islands. I was just in time to take a Three hour boat trip to Boca Chita Key where I explored the shoreline and climbed into the lighthouse. It was a definite “do again”.

To fully experience the park you need a boat. We took the snorkeling tour from Biscayne national park institute (they also run boat tour, paddling tour and sailing tours). The check-in staff at bookstore was really helpful to accommodate a few last-minute changes for us. The tour guides are very knowledgeable and provides tons of information about the park, the environments and the sealife along our way to Anniversary reef. We saw plenty of tropical fishes during snorkeling (which lasted about 40 minutes, and ~40 minutes one-way to the snorkeling site) as if we were scuba diving in a huge tank in some aquarium. We also rented kayaks after the snorkeling tour and get close up with the sea birds, which was also amazing.","December 27, 2017",Paradise if you are into water activities,27,"Boston, Massachusetts",5

Very easy to navigate the water, very calm and the water is very shallow, going from 3 feet in some places to around 12 feet a little further out. Staff are all friendly and helpful. Was disappointed we didn't see more wildlife. Saw some great birds and some fish, no rays, sharks and not too many fish. If we went again we would pay the extra money and reserve one of the guided trips out to the keys or the snorkelling trips.

Biscayne National Park,"This park is everything about water! You can go for snorkeling tours, kayaking tours, or take a boat ride. The best part here what I experienced is kayaking. There are couple of canals entering the bay. The kayaking start point is near the beach and you go inside bay (as oppose to going inside ocean) and then go to the canals. The bay is very shallow.......the water is barely three feet deep. If you kayak near mangrove tree shores, the water depth is barely couple feet. The good thing is even though the water is shallow, its not muddy, so you can see the bottom very clearly. Then when you proceed to canal, you can spot sting rays and manatees. For beginners who never did kayaking before, this is a great experience! I have seen five to six year old kids also did kayaking very confidently and comfortably here. The staff administering kayaking is very experienced and cooperative. So, if you are in trouble, you can get him easily!","December 3, 2017",Don't miss kayaking!,20,"Plainsboro, New Jersey",4

This part of the park is very quiet. The boat took us to Boca Chita where the lighthouse is. The lighthouse is beautiful. This part of the park is very crowded, boats tied up two deep, loud music everywhere. We did get to go to the top of the lighthouse. Your time is limited here. Approx. 1 hour of free time to see lighthouse, enjoy water and use the facilities. Boat ride was enjoyable, we saw lots of different types info birds.

Although the Boca Chita Boat Tour was excellent as far as the National Park staff were concerned, the people who had their boats docked at Boca Chita ignored the staff requests to turn off loud music and not to swim in the harbor. The visitors immediately did what the park staff member said, but as soon as our tour group passed, went back to playing loud music and swimming in the harbor. There needs to be some means for banning the people who do not follow the rules. It is distracting and dangerous behavior.","October 27, 2017",Appalled at Lack of Respect for Park Staff,5,,3

Unlike the commercialism if the more developed National Parks, this stop was low pressure. The 1/4 mile walk around the visitors center is a breeze but bumpy if you are in a wheelchair. The view of downtown Miami way off in the distance lends perspective of the enormity of this bay. The visitors center is nicely done and the exhibits are very straight forward. They invite you to touch shells and skeletons of many marine species. I had never seen a dolphin skull and I learned a lot about the size of their brain. Good stop for families, easy place for all ages and today it was very peaceful. I waded in the bay and the water was warm and inviting. So I went swimming!

We took a 40 minute boat ride out around the different keys which was fun in and of itself (they really pick up speed!) and then we had about an hour to snorkel. I've snorkeled a few places but this was surprisingly one of the best reefs! Lots to see, though beware there are a few jelly fish. The day we went out the water was pretty choppy and a few people got sick, so it's probably worth calling ahead to ask what the conditions are like that day if you tend to get motion sick.

If you're able to go during the week, I would highly recommend doing so as we ended up having almost all of Boca Chita to ourselves while we were there. Defintely play it safe and book early.

It was interesting to see that most of the Bay in this area is rarely deeper that 10 feet. The guide gave some interesting fact about the history of the area and the keys as well as some information about the wildlife. We sailed north along Elliott Key's coast close enough that we spotted a raccoon Elliott Key. Eventually, we docked at Boca Chita Key where we were given 45 minutes or so to explore. We were able to go up in the ornamental lighthouse and take in the sites. We returned to the vistor's center after departing Boca Chita Key. Now I can say I have visted the Florida Keys!

Most of the water is very shallow, in some places you have to push to make headway, but you can see an urban wilderness close to lots of people. The park runs for most of southern Miami Dade and down into Monroe county. The Florida keys begin in the waters of park and protect vital areas of seabed.

There was a nice nature trail but we didn't make it very far since you only have an hour. Based on other peoples reviews I thought the kids might be able to do some snorkeling during our free time but it was definitely the wrong time of year for that and there really weren't any fish around the main beaches anyway. There is a full day park tour that goes to other more remote beaches with better snorkeling opportunities. We all had a lot of fun being outside and exploring.

The roads are all parallel or 90 degrees to each other, so be prepared for a series of right and left turns once you leave Highway 1. After one long drive down a road you will come to a sign that reads Biscayne National Park (on the left) and the name for a marina to the right. Go into the park and in another 30 feet you will be at the park headquarters.Biscayne is an amazing national park in that it is small, very quiet and serene and very well maintained. There is a nice presentation of the various parts of the habitat in the Visitor's Center and a nice shop nearby. The park has a walkway that goes out to the ocean and from that walkway you can see Miami in the distance (to the north). We saw many different fish and one blue crab as we walked along the walkway.

The water was calm. We did not snorkel, but learned that the snorkeling is amazing with all the sea life and the coral reefs. The visitor's center has a very informative 20 minute film about the park, the ecosystems and the animal life. Well worth the time! The surprising part was there was no entrance fee as in most National Parks.","February 1, 2017",Amazing,58,"San Francisco, California",5
Biscayne National Park,"Be sure to make a reservation for the boat ahead of time. The reservation system is a little primitive but the boat ride and the naturalist were great. One hour ride over, one hour on Boca Chica island and one hour back to dock. A lovely national park. to fully explore you need your own boat, but the NPS boat gives you a three sampling of the ecosystem.","January 29, 2017",Worth the trip,46,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Biscayne National Park,"We took the boat tour of Biscayne National Park, which was a beautiful 3-hour trip, including 1 hour spent on a small island (Boca Chita Key). We had reservations, and our tour was full (about 44 people). The boat used is a large pontoon, and luckily for me the ride was glass smooth that day. The volunteer guide is quite good, and the little island very picturesque, with a small non-working lighthouse that you’re allowed to climb. Best of all, we saw two manatees when we pulled back into the harbor. Some tips if you decide to take this trip:• Make reservations. It doesn’t cost anything to put your name on the list, and tours do fill up.• Sit on the left (port) side of the boat for a better view of the mangroves coming in.• There are bathrooms at the visitor center, a small bathroom on the boat, and restrooms (probably vault) on the island.• You can bring snacks on the boat. There are no concessions on the island.• Wear Deet, especially if you plan to walk around Boca Chita Key. I was in Florida for two weeks and got a total of 3 insects bites, all of them within 1 minute of stepping on to the undeveloped side of this island.Boat tours are $31 per person. If you decide not to take the boat tour, you can instead explore the small Dante Fascell Visitor Center and walk the ¼ mile Jetty trail, with pretty views of the harbor and bay. There is no fee to enter this National Park.","January 29, 2017",A three hour tour,520,"San Jose, California",4

Biscayne National Park,"My wife and I went to Biscayne National Park for a 1 day visit and we took the National Park boat ride to Boca Chita Keys where the Boca Chita Lighthouse is located. It was a very peaceful ride on the boat while also looking for bird life, dolphins, turtles and pelicans. I recommend the boat ride, you won't be disappointed. Take bug (mosquito) spray while you are on the Boca Chita Keys. We went in January and there were still mosquitoes at that time. Also, you might see a platypus if you are lucky.

Biscayne National Park,"I did get a boat tour easily without advance reservations, but I also came in December before everyone got off for Christmas and New Years. I'm guessing that if it is near a big holiday or when kids have school off, you should definitely make reservations. I was just glad they were having a tour on the Thursday I came. The boat tour to Boca Chita is well worth it, since this National Park is mostly water. Boats are the way to explore, so do plan ahead to find a concessionaire with kayaks or book a boat tour. This is not a National Park to just show up at with a day to spend without plans, unless you only have an hour to walk around the trails next to Dante Fascell Visitor Center. I was lucky and came when it wasn't busy and when they had a tour going. It was the only one that day and left at 10 am, so everyone after that was out of luck. There is a very informative visitor's center with some interesting architectural detail, and there are some trails, including one that goes out into the bay all between Mangrove trees the whole way to give you an idea of what being in a Mangrove forest would be like (but much nicer). The boat tour to Boca Chita was about 4 hours, so it is a chunk of the day if you reserve in advance or come when it isn't busy. I looked like they weren't running every day when it wasn't busy, so definitely confirm. It was well worth it and a definite highlight with the boat tour, but if you don't plan in advance then you won't have as good an experience. I would definitely return and recommend. There is also a state park nearby with swimming that my boat tour ticket covered admission to, but I didn't visit.","January 5, 2017",Mostly submerged National Park - plan ahead,29,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5
Biscayne National Park,"This National Park was highly recommended to us, but didn't have a whole lot. It would be nice if they expanded some of the land-based and cold-weather activities. There is a boardwalk where you can walk out through some mangroves, mostly where people go fishing. Fair amount of litter unfortunately, although the rangers were trying to pick it up. Some educational signs but few exhibits. Not even much scenery. We saw a couple kinds of fish, but mostly murky water. There were a few kite surfers. Boat tours are only offered some days and you need advance reservations during peak periods. The host redirected us to the John Pennenkamp Coral Reef State Park near Key Largo which has a few more things to do with kids.","January 3, 2017",Not much here,24,"Chapel Hill, North Carolina",2
Biscayne National Park,"This is a lovely spot for a walk or a picnic. We weren't able to get on the boat ride, which was sold out - you have to make reservations at least 2-3 weeks in advance. In fact, if there is anything you are thinking of doing in the area, make a reservation in advance. However, we enjoyed the Visitors Center - which had excellent Junior Ranger programs, including Junior Ranger badges for Underwater Explorer and Paleontologist, which I had never seen before. We also enjoyed walking on the short nature trail which provides easy access to the waterfront for playing and exploring and excellent views.","January 2, 2017",Biscayne with my 9 year old,33,,4
Biscayne National Park,"This park offers many options for exploration, all via boat. The NPS offers a guided boat tour.

Biscayne National Park,"Went here on a slightly windy day, so our family couldn't rent the kayaks with younger kids. Kayaks were only $20 an hour. Visitor center was nice, but as the website says, there's only a mile or so of trails so not much to do land-wise. The boat tours were all booked, so we left for Homestead Bay Park right down the street where we were told boat rentals were available, but the boat there only goes from Homestead bay to Biscayne and back (we were looking to see our by the reefs). We should've booked our boat rental more in advance. Because we didn't, this park didn't have too much to do for us, but still we were glad to scratch it off our list.","December 31, 2016",Cool place but limited for young children ,27,,3
Biscayne National Park,"Wish we had planned more time here but we didn't plan ahead at all. Visited Coral Castle and, as we began the trip back to Doral, my husband remembered there was a National Park nearby. So we drove about 15 minutes out of our way to see it. How beautiful! We walked through the visitors center, then strolled the waterfront. Lots of families were picnicking and fishing. Looks like you could rent kayaks. There's also a free trolley to transport people between Everglades National Park and Biscayne. I think it also stops in Homestead. We had already visited the Shark Alley section of Everglades National Park but, if I had known in advance about the trolley, would've visited this section instead. As it was, we only had about an hour at this lovely spot. ","December 28, 2016",Quiet refuge near Miami,30,"San Antonio, Texas",5

Make sure you check the schedule for boat trips there and book early as possible.","December 28, 2016",Great place to visit,48,"Reno, Nevada",5
Biscayne National Park,"I really loved this because I was very fascinated by the eco system. When you get to the park, go to the ranger station. There is a great video which will walk you through the various fragile systems which keep everything going. The keys themselves are unique in that they are basically an exposed reef. The mangroves start the chain of life which ultimately expands out to 180K acres of protected sea life. The video spans mangroves, coral reefs, sealife, birds, etc., which all work together to make it special. Spend some time in the museum, and learn how they had to fight to keep Biscayne free from development. The keys actually start closer than Key Largo, but you can't get to the northern keys because they are protected. There's a short shoreline walk outside the museum which is worth it. We say a manatee and it was clear enough to see downtown Miami, clear across the Bay. ","December 23, 2016",Worth the trip!,285,,5

Biscayne National Park,"My husband and daughter took a Saturday 10am boat tour to Boca Chita Key, and we had a great time! The visitor center has a lot of exhibits, with a lot of hands on stuff for my 12 daughter to check out. Remember, this park is mostly water, so you need a boat to access most of it. They didn't have a kayak concessioner when we were there, so I called the day before to reserve 3 spots on the boat tour they offer. The park has no entrance fees, but the boat tour is ~$30 per adult, and $20 for kids under 12. The boat tour leaves from right outside the visitor center, you just head to the bookstore on the 2nd floor to check in and pay for the boat tour(keep your receipt and you can get free entry to Homestead Bayfront Park next door later in the day). Our boat wasnt completely full, but it was crowded, I recommend calling to book ahead of time to assure there is space. The boat ride takes you out to Boca Chita Key and takes about 45 minutes. It is a scenic ride and the Ranger was super informative. We saw multiple dolphins and a large school of jellyfish, great trip for photos. We had about an hour on the key, and the Ranger unlocked the lighthouse for us to walk up into and check out the view. There is a trail, but in the summer is covered with mosquitos, so we did not hike there. The weather was great, and we had our bathing suits, so we went for a dip in the small beachside area. Be careful tho, the current there is very strong. There are also public docks on the key for local boaters, and they tend to play really loud music, but we didn't find it to be a big deal, I imagine since it was a Saturday there were probably more people with their boats docked than there might be on weekday, so keep that in mind. Overall, I'd recommend this as a day trip if you're near South Miami or maybe on your way to the keys. It's a ways from the touristy areas of South Beach, but is a beautiful natural part of Miami.

We spent a little time in the visitor center and took the boat tour. It is ~ 3 hours and 2 of it are on the boat. We only got off at Boca Chita, and enjoyed touring around on it for ~ 1 hour. The 'ornamental' lighthouse was fun as we also love lighthouses. With the heat and sun of south Florida I strongly recommend the 10 AM tour instead of the afternoon. You should check by phone or internet because the boat doesn't run all the time, and if you don't catch the boat, you don't have so much to do/see -- as the park is ~95% water.

The only downfall to this park is that there are no kayak rentals on the grounds (per visitors information office); however we did see some stacked by the entrance? It's best to call ahead and confirm prior to arriving there if you're interested in kayaking there.The park seems to be dog friendly. I saw a few pooches swimming with their owners and others walking on the bridge.The views are gorgeous and there is a lot of marine life that you see just from walking on the bridge.

Biscayne National Park,"We did some research prior to arriving at Biscayne National Park. We had seen the boat tours as part of the park and decided to reserve. Originally, they were only on weekends through May, but they eventually added more tours, Friday, Saturdays, and Sundays at select times in June and July. We ended up taking the afternoon tour (1:30. They also have a 10:30) on June 12th. The trip cost $29 and was well worth it.Most of Biscayne is under water, so snorkeling trips are common. We were also going to Key West and Tortugas National Park, so decided to see what we could with the boat tour. We boarded the boat and got some initial facts and information from our Ranger Jay, who was very knowledgeable and personable. We started out slow in the channel until we reached the open water. At that point the boat picked up speed and headed out. The water is pretty shallow and was the most unbelievable shades of blue, green and turquoise. We stopped at 1 point and Ranger Jay donned his mask and jumped in to see what life he could find. He brought up some sponges and coral. Later we fund little shrimp coming out of the sponge. They brought them all to the center of the boat (which was a covered catamaran) for everyone to see. We were able to touch things and you could see how fascinated the kids on the boat were. Once done, they let the kids release them overboard back into the water. From there we headed to Boca Chita Key, where the most iconic lighthouse stands. The scenery was amazing! We were able to spend 45 minutes on the island, which was just marvelous. There was more on the island than we though. There was a bathroom, and many boats pulled up for picnics, etc. They opened the lighthouse for us. It was very interesting, up a spiral staircase. The views from the top were like postcards. You could also swim during this time. We didn't realize they stopped that long and that there would be time for swimming. There wasn't a lot of time, but the crystal clear water was irresistible! We didn't bring suits but my son and I went in clothes and all as it was just too tempting! Overall the trip too 3 hours and was definitely a great way to see Biscayne National Park.

Needs development as a National Park.,67,New Jersey,3
Biscayne National Park,Although the web site says one can rent a boat (canoe or kayak) that service is no longer available.

Biscayne National Park,"Biscayne National Park protects the coral reefs and keys of Biscayne Bay, located on the southeastern coast of Florida just north of the keys. Most of the park is water, so if you want to visit the off-shore attractions it will be helpful to bring your own boat. When we visited in December 2015 the park did not have a concessionaire offering boat tours, but it sounded like they were expecting to ""sign a contract"" any day so check with them if you are planning a trip. Even if you don't have a boat, there are some things to do on the coast, and admission is FREE. We accessed Biscayne National Park at the Dante Fascell Visitor Center (east of Homestead) and at Black Point Park (see separate reviews). The Dante Fascell Visitor Center is a lovely building with a balcony overlooking the bay and a small marina. It houses exhibits about the bay ecosystem, a theatre showing an informative video (20 mins), an art exhibit, a small book/gift store, and restrooms. The rangers were organizing a 3-mile hike to an area frequented by manatees, so check ahead for scheduled activities if you are interested. Outside the Visitor Center there is a beautiful interpretative trail and a picnic area along the shoreline. There's also a launch area for canoes or kayaks and I saw a rack of them next to the launch, so it may be possible to rent one. The paved trail leads to a nice boardwalk across the shallow water of the bay to a jetty with a trail that extends out about 1/4 mile into the bay (partially boardwalk then gravel). We enjoyed walking out the jetty through the shade of the mangroves and saw some interesting fish and many birds. The facilities at Dante Fascell Visitor Center are clean, attractive, wheelchair-accessible and well-maintained. Tip: There is no food service at this location but the Visitor Center is located right next to Homestead Bayfront Park where there is a restaurant, swimming beach, picnic area and marina (see separate reviews). There is another, similar jetty trail on the shore of Biscayne Bay about 8 miles north of the Dante Fascell Visitor Center at Black Point Park (see separate reviews). This 1.5 mile jetty trail is a wide gravel path that connects to paved multi-use trails along the north side of Black Creek that are popular with bicyclists and fishermen. To access it, park at Black Point Park and follow the paved Biscayne Trail around the marina and across Black Creek on SW 87th Ave., then follow the paved Black Creek Trail to the right. Facilities in this area include a marina, boat launch, picnic areas, restrooms and a restaurant.","February 2, 2016",Very Nice- Just Know What to Expect,1781,"Tucson, Arizona",4

The signs outside along the path made me really think about the enormity of where I was standing in relation to the entire North American continent! The exhibits inside the visitor's center were well thought out for all ages to enjoy. Not to mention it was all free! It was so nice to see local families taking advantage and enjoying such a gem in their own backyard. There are picnic tables and grills set up right by the water.

Biscayne National Park,"We went to Biscayne National Park two times this past week. The first was supposed to be for a tour by a private company that cancelled on us with no advanced notice. After talking to a park ranger at the visitor center (BTW, always talk to a ranger, they know everything!), he pointed us to a new tour they were going start just today! We got to go on the inaugural tour after a long period where the park didn't offer any of its own boat tours.For $30 a person we got a ranger lead tour in an intimate group of about 15 across the bay and to Boca Chita. Along the way out the ranger gave a great overview of the park and its natural features. On Boca Chita the ranger continued the talk and lead us up to the top of the lighthouse! The visit is a bit short, but very nice (many mosquitoes anyway, so it was good to be quick). On the way back the ranger shared even more information about the park. The very best part was that the boat ride to/from is just long enough that everyone had as much time as they wanted to chat with the ranger and ask one-on-one questions.The tour was such a treat, especially after the debacle earlier in the week. The Rangers saved our visit to the park and made it really really enjoyable. Call ahead and ask about this tour since it is not yet on their website.

Biscayne National Park,"I am a writer and photographer for National Park Planner and I visited Biscayne National Park in March 2015. Biscayne National Park encompasses 172,000 acres of Biscayne Bay and has a visitor center located 35 miles south of Miami, Florida, in Homestead. The park is 95% water, which means that there is not a lot to do without a boat. Landlubbers can visit the Dante Fascell Visitor Center and walk the short Jetty Trail. Those looking to engage in canoeing or kayaking can launch their boats into the bay also from the Visitor Center. For those without a boat, during the tourist season an authorized park concessionaire offers a daily sailing excursion for up to six people, and of course you are welcome to rent a boat from any local marina.For those with boats, the park offers fishing, diving, and snorkeling opportunities in both the calmer waters of Biscayne Bay and in the open Atlantic. Of the dozens of islands, or “keys,” in the park, only three have any developed facilities. The rest are just a tangle of mangrove and maritime forests that are impenetrable other than to those wanting to Lewis-and-Clark-it™. The keys of Boca Chita and Elliott have a boat dock, a campground, a picnic area, and hiking trails, while Adams Key is open for day-use only and has a picnic area and a short trail.Biscayne National Park started out as Biscayne National Monument back in 1968. After being enlarged it obtained the “National Park” moniker in 1980. However, it is not most people’s idea of a National Park, and not just because it is 95% water. I don’t mean to belittle the park’s beauty or its worthy purpose of halting development, but essentially this is a National Park for the people of Miami who own a boat, which means that it really should be a National Recreation Area, not a National Park. There is nothing here that is going to attract people from around the world, or even from around the country. It’s not like everything gets sunnier or the water gets bluer once you enter the park. It’s just the ocean.Every boater I spoke to who had traveled from states further up the east coast—and there weren’t many—was just passing through, most on their way to Key West or to the Bahamas. Even to the people of Miami it’s just a place to go boating or fishing or to party at Boca Chita Key. Nobody is really thinking, “I’m in a National Park!” I have a park just like this where I live in Atlanta, the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area. And that’s what Biscayne National Park should be, a National Recreation Area.The National Park Service can’t even land a contract with a concessionaire to provide affordable excursions. It lost the concessionaire for the 2015 season, which is why I needed a friend with a boat to visit the park, and for 2016 it has one company offering an all day sailing excursion for groups of up to six people. I’m not knocking the service, but small groups mean big prices, and at $150/person, there aren’t many families that can afford to spend the day at Biscayne. The previous concessionaire had large boats that could haul a bunch of people out to snorkel at $50 apiece. I expect there to be affordable ways for the average American to enjoy a “National Park.” I expect people to have their own boats in a National Recreation Area.So, can’t afford to own a boat. Can’t afford to rent a boat. Can’t afford $750 to take your family out in a boat. You basically have a National Park for the wealthy. I understand that Dry Tortugas National Park costs $170/person to visit, but it’s out in the middle of nowhere 70 miles from Key West. Biscayne is a stone’s throw from one of the largest cities in the United States and its islands are only 7 miles off the coast.Even its Ranger-led, land-based programs have been cut back. People want to blame budget cuts, but I didn’t see any curtailing of services at Everglades National Park, the park that I had just come from before visiting Biscayne. The National Park Service runs its own boats and buses in a number of parks, including free boat service at Fort Matanzas National Monument in St. Augustine, so I don’t know why it can’t do the same for a “National Park” if concessionaires cannot be found. Oh yeah, I forgot. Budget cuts.I would suggest bringing one of the boats from Fort Matanzas down to Biscayne, but as it turns out, according to the National Park Service’s visitation statistics, more people visit Fort Matanzas. How can more people visit a fort that nobody has heard of than a National Park off the coast of Miami? Simple. There’s no affordable way for the average person to visit it. Hell, even if the sailing excursion was free, it’s only taking six people a day.With all that said, there is plenty of beauty in the park for those who can take advantage of it. Biscayne Bay is where the Florida Keys begin. Snorkelers and divers will find the northernmost reefs in the country here, plus there are many shipwrecks in the park, most shallow enough to reach without SCUBA gear. There’s no limit to the time you can spend fishing, and being protected from the waves of the Atlantic Ocean by the keys, canoeists and kayakers can paddle around in the bay on a nice day without too many safety concerns. There’s a lot to love if you can love it.For complete information about visiting Biscayne National Park see the National Park Planner web site.","January 21, 2016",Biscayne National Park,201,"Roswell, Georgia",3

The visitor center is large and has great displays about the animals and that are in the area. The film was also filled with great stuff. It is newer and in four parts. It seemed a bit long though. The Rangers were great, but there are no services in the park to take you to the islands. Most of Biscayne is water! For the last 3 years there has been no concessionaire! We couldn't even rent a canoe. There is one private company they recommend, but that tour is only once a day. I really don't want to give it a poor review, but there is just not much there.

There is a beautiful Visitor Center on the end point of land with a lot of informative exhibits on the historical and ecological aspects of the area. A short movie on the park is shown in the theater. There are some walkways around the Center and also a short one-way trail out into the bay alongside the boat channel. Everything is well signed and the views are excellent. A large part of the park is a marine preserve and includes several offshore islands. The lighthouse pictured on the park's brochure is on one of these islands and only accessible by boat. Unfortunately, the park does not currently have a concession boat tour operator so we could not visit anything else. The receptionist at the Visitor Center said some operators in Miami do conduct tours into the park but there were no brochures. A full tourist visit here for sightseeing and snorkeling would definitely require some advanced planning and an overnight stay in Homestead. Most of the visitors we saw were locals that were fishing.

Biscayne National Park,"Enjoy an experience few others chose to appreciate -- the peace and solitude of a tropical sunrise at Biscayne National Park. Gates to Dante Fascell Visitor Center officially open at 7:00 AM. That’s the same time the winter sun first peaks over the horizon above distant Elliott Key. The parking lot at the Visitor Center is virtually empty at that hour. The accessible boardwalk hugs lapping waters of shallow Biscayne Bay, leading to a jetty lined with mangroves. The wispy sound of ibis wings gently penetrate the morning calm. Schools of small mullet stir still waters. As the morning unfolds, wavelets sparkle in the rising sun. High rise buildings of Miami and Key Biscayne punctuate the distant northern horizon. Bicyclists arrive from their morning tours to relax and converse on teak rocking chairs that line the broad porches outside the Visitor Center. At 9:00 AM, the doors to the Visitor Center open. Inside, there is a small but well executed exhibit hall that helps explain the terrestrial and marine ecosystems within the National Park. There is a small theater where the curious traveler can view short video documentaries on the biology and history of Biscayne National Park.

There are lot of benches with views of the water and a boardwalk area to walk on. There is a nice small visitor center display area with some neat stuff. Most of the parks glory is in the water...if you don't have a boat you miss it. There were not any places to swim or hang out in the water that we saw.There must be a problem with the concessioners. You can still get someone to take you out - they have a list at the visitor center, but it wouldn't be a spur of the moment trip -it would take calling ahead and planning. It appeared really expensive too. The volunteer in the gift shop told us that the reef is 8-9 miles by boat from the park. I would think this would make it time consuming and expensive (gas) to take people out that far. She suggested we go to John Pennekamp State Park in Key Largo if we wanted to see the reef for a better/easier trip.","January 8, 2015","Pretty, but not much to do unless you have a boat",196,"Irmo, South Carolina",3

The park is beautiful such a shame we couldn't see the majority of it.The staff were very helpful and even phoned the John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park down in Key Largo to book us on a glass bottomed boat tour from there. They also told us of a free kayak and picnic trip a few days later but unfortunately it was fully booked.

Biscayne National Park,"Wow! Had no idea such a marvelous underwater park wonderland existed so close to Everglades NP!! Great day visit! Enjoyed the museum, local art gallery, easy and picturesque Boardwalk and Jetty Trail along the water’s edge where it's easy to spot fish (but no manatee the day I visited), plus various ranger programs currently offered during winter 2014/spring2015. Saw many people fishing. Advise bring food, snacks and drinks and picnic by the water otherwise no concessions on-site so I left and came back. The rocking chairs on the Visitor Center porch provide great chill spot :-)While visiting on weekdays appear less crowded and more serene, I missed out on the Sat ranger led canoe and snorkel tours. But I went on the Friday 10:15am Jetty Walk with Ranger Denise and the 2pm Dip-net Program also with Ranger Denise. Both were informative, interesting and a great way to learn more about the park. On the Jetty Walk Denise educated me about Biscayne’s ecosystems such as the mangrove shoreline, the shallow marine nursery, and impressively, Biscayne NP protects the 3rd largest coral barrier reef system in the world (after Australia’s Great Barrier Reef and Belize Coral Reef) plus the Florida Keys Reef system is North America’s only living coral barrier reef!!! Since only 5% of the park is land, I gotta get underwater the next time I’m in Florida! When the park can provide boat tours and rentals, it would be awesome to return and join a ranger-led dive, snorkel or tour of the 3 small islands! Sadly, surrounding this glorious park, modern human civilization is never far from sight. View of the Miami-Dade Landfill, City of Miami, and the Turkey Point nuclear plant surrounds the park on all sides to remind us of the frightening pace that modern human civilization alters our natural environment from tearing down old-growth forests, poisoning rivers, destroying natural habitat, polluting our oceans, to releasing gases into the atmosphere . There’s a proposed expansion of the Turkey Point nuclear plant, only 25 miles south of Miami! Won’t building more nuclear reactors adversely impact Biscayne’s wondrous underwater coral reef and the Everglades’ restoration? Will our kids and grandkids be able to enjoy the subliminal beauty of these extraordinary underwater forests and the “river of grass”???Later that day, I really lucked out on my park visit and sighted a rare white morph of the Great Blue Heron at the tip of the Jetty Trail standing tall, regal, and entirely all-white among the brown pelicans and other wading birds!!! Aka Great White Heron, my sighted Great White Heron is only found in the Florida Keys. Their population was decimated by the demand for feathered hats and faced extinction. Today’s population is estimated to be only around 1,000 and most live on and around the Florida Keys and mangrove islands. Since they’re rare, it’s easy to dismiss a Great White Heron sighting as a Great Egret, more common in the south. BUT my magnificent Great White Heron is larger than the Great Egret and sports light colored or orangish-yellowish-grayish legs, while the Great Egret legs are always black. What a delightful day! Don't forget your camera & binoculars.This family friendly national park provides plenty of activities for all ages to enjoy at water’s edge. Great information is provided online to help you plan your visit: http://www.nps.gov/bisc/planyourvisit/index.htm","December 31, 2014",Highly recommend spend a day or plan to spend a week if you enjoy the water!!,167,"Tysons Corner, Virginia",5
Biscayne National Park,"The park itself is really not much to see, as 95% of it is under water and the watercraft company that supplied boats, kayaks, etc, went out of business and pulled out, leaving the park with 5% land activities avail to park goers. There are still ranger guided tours, special events and a little bit for the younger kids to do with a ranger for scheduled activities, and it is lovely. We went ""netting"" with a ranger, which is just what it says... they gave us nets, explained and gave us a crash course on the fish, bugs and snails we would maybe get in our net. My husband caught a tiny seahorse his first net dip, and I got some pipefish, whose heads and snouts look like a seahorse, and I guess are in the seahorse family, someone got some snails and some shrimp. HOWEVER... when I asked a ranger about manatee sighting areas, she told me where in and near park grounds where to go, between a half mile and 1.5 mile walking distance, and told me she had a 100% success rate with seeing some recently, so off we went! And, sure enough, manatees swimming, rolling around, blowing bubbles, and quite a few, actually, up close!

Manatees are often seen in the lagoon right out front,even though we weren't that lucky, there was one here in the morning. Photo ops abound. Among my favorite part of the site is the incredible stone walls around the site - they are made up of fossilized coral reef stones. The fossils are so prominent that they almost jump out at you.

Unfortunately we came in what is essentially ""off season"", which sounds strange since southern Florida is generally warm in the fall. There were no boats/ferries to visit the islands. We were told that they are currently negotiating a contract for that type of service in the future. The walk along the boardwalk takes you to a point where you have a nice view of Miami on one side and the ocean on the other. There is no fee for the park, as it is too hard to enforce visitors who come by boat. A very popular place for bikers, families and especially fishermen/women.

It's a very nice place to walk around, along the bay, there are some areas that you can go in with your snorkel and check the coral reef, but you need booties or water shoes, the bottom is very rocky. You can fish there too and also they have canoes and kayak rental. The visitor center is nice and they have really nice staff willing to help you if it's your first time.

Lucky for us, my husband grab her and he was able to stand in the water because we didn't go too far from the shore.

There are also films to see on the park and a small museum. There is no admission charge to anything.A brown pelican on piling number 17 kept us company for hours. It slept, stretched, yawned, picked its fleas, and presided over its domain. Two more pelicans flew by searching for fish in the pristine and clear water. A great white heron stalked for food by the shoreline of mangroves, crabs crawling in and out, and oysters on corals. There are also white pelicans and manatees but we did not see them.The boardwalk is nice but it is only a quarter mile long. The National Park Service should expand it. It is a lovely place to sit, read, converse, and fish.Many locals, men and women, young and old, fish with rods or throw lines over the rails. The bay is rich with lots of good-sized fish such as mangrove snapper and mullet suitable for eating.The glass-bottomed boats to see the corals and life under the sea were not in service. There were also canoes but I am not sure whether they are rented out yet. A little of the wondrous beauty under the water, however, can be seen from the boardwalk.

We were able to visit the visitors center, which was very nice and had some informative displays, we also walked the boardwalk path there which is just about a 1/4 mile walk. During our visit we also attended a ranger program called gifts from the sea. I have to say that when we sat down for the program, I didn't expect much, however I really enjoyed the talk. The park ranger was very knowledgeable and made the talk quite interesting. There were many adults in attendance as well a children and it seemed that everyone enjoyed the discussion. The one thing that kept me from rating this park higher was the fact that I had attempted to both call and email to make reservations for one of their ranger guided canoe trips, and never received a call back to confirm. I showed up at the time of the trip anyway, hoping to be able to still join the canoe trip, only to find that they were full with others who had reservations. I was a bit put off by the fact that I had also attempted to make reservations for the trip but was unable to due to a lack of follow-up from the park staff.

Biscayne National Park,"The vast majority of the park is under water so you need to snorkel if you come. Not only do you get to experience a wonderful reef, you get out on the water to see much of the park. We went to a nice patch reef off Elliot Key in 8-12 feet of water. Unlike Pennecamp the day before, this is in open water. Still no problem with waves and current. As for the snorkel itself, beautiful,colorful coral is everywhere including brain, fan, staghorn and more. Of all the snorkels I have done in various parts of Florida, this was the best, healthiest coral I had seen. There were several fish but they were small and not as diverse as Pennecamp or Key West. However, the best part for me was no barracudas. The other good thing is the best coral is right around the mooring site. Due to the east wind the current really took you over the coral. This was a really impressive place to go. While not as many fish, I did see a beautiful queen angel fish which I had never seen before. I highly recommend this activity.","May 18, 2013",Great coral snorkel,459,"Pensacola, Florida",5
Biscayne National Park,"The ""Underwater"" is an important part of the name. We went there just to spend the day near the water and go snorkeling but you can't really do this from the shore.So if you are going there plan to get on one of their boats (glass bottom boat was broken on our visit, so maybe call ahead) or rent kayaks.","April 14, 2013",Not much to do on your own,19,"Boston, Massachusetts",3

Biscayne National Park,This is a gem that many often over look because of the remote location but it is highly worth the visit. The staff is very helpful and friendly. It's not far from the Homestead Raceway a must see if you are in South Florida.

Biscayne National Park,"Diving, sailing and fishing all within a stone's throw from downtown Miami. Clear water for divers with plenty of fish. Reefs provide a paradise for underwater photographers. My wife and I often spend time in the Park and have lunch on Boca Chita key. This offers a protected harbor with tables available under cover from sun and occasional showers. Fish for the elusive Bonefish and the hard to catch Permit along with the acrobatic Tarpon. No charge to enter. Boat ramps for those who bring their own boats. Dive boats for those who wish to dive.","September 28, 2012",Dive and fish in sight of Miami,70,Miami FL,5

Biscayne National Park,"Another exceptional National Park, thankfully these wonderful areas have been set aside.I doubt that there is the mindset to do this today. Developers would have their way and mansions and condos would be where we now have these wonderful areas set aside for everyone’s enjoyment.Since most of the park is under water and we did not venture out to any of those areas it is difficult to really give a review of anything other than the visitor center and the surrounding grounds. The camping was closed because there were too many bugs and some of the other activities did not have enough patronage to run that morning. The NPS says to plan ahead to avoid that type of thing.I’d still say it is worth the trip if you are in the area.","June 16, 2012",Nice National Park...,315,"Cedar City, Utah",4
Biscayne National Park,This is a great park to visit close to Miami where you can get a good appreciation of what Biscayne underwater has to offer. From here you can take a snorkel tour boat which takes you out to interesting reefs on the northern edge of the underwater National Park. The park also offers a board walk over the water and out along the waterway where you can fish and or just walk and enjoy the view.,"May 21, 2012",Biscayne park close to Miami,82,Annapolis,5
Biscayne National Park,"This park's real attraction is under the water, so get out on it if you can. The visitor's center in Homestead is small, with a couple of exhibits on the underwater life. They also have a number of very interesting and educational films, including some on the park generally, the devastation Hurricane Andrew caused, and Stiltsville--the community of houses build on stilts in the bay.I have on several occasions tried to do the glass-bottomed boat tour of the bay, which I've never been able to do because the boat appears to be perpetually under repair. That said, I have taken the boat ride to Boca Chita, which does make for a diverting afternoon.","February 16, 2012",Relaxing place to get away and get in touch with nature,34,"Washington, DC area",5

Biscayne National Park,"We had a long morning drive to this place in order to take part in their series of free guided canoe trips. First of all, before heading out, I recieved some of the friendliest and most helpful emails ever from park staff. I basically asked - when can we come? And I got back GPS coordinates, jokes, different options, etc. Sadly, we arrived late for the start of our trip, but we called en route and they held the trip up for us - we felt a bit guilty about this but truthfully everyone else seemed to take it in stride. They provide you with everything - canoes, paddles, lifejackets - just show up with clothes you can get a little damp and some sun gear and water and you're good to go. We then paddled out and checked out some mangrove lined creeks and wildlife - it was very cool, though keep in mind it's a fairly recreational and laid back canoe trip - the guides stop often to talk about wildlife and history. It's a great way to spend a morning, and it's really not too much of a workout (though I think some of the longer day trips may be a bit more intense and for experienced paddlers only).","February 12, 2012","Free Canoe Trip - nothing too wild, but good staff.",1,,4

Biscayne National Park,"I really enjoyed visiting this national park visitor's center. The park film is great, and there is a nice museum. You can also borrow expedition backpacks to take out onto the trails surrounding the visitor's center, although it is incredibly hot in June. It's worth a stop here even if you don't have time to do a snorkel or dive.","September 19, 2011","Great Visitor's Center, even if you don't have time to get on the water",262,"Reading, Pennsylvania",4
Biscayne National Park,"Best place for scuba diving or snorkeling on the coral reef systems of southern Florida. A glass boat tour is also available for those who can't swim.

Biscayne National Park,I was very disappointed in the Biscayne underwater park. We rented kayaks explore the bay area and there wasn't a lot to see. The area around John Pennekamp has many more areas to explore in a kayak. The people weren't very friendly either.,"February 22, 2011",Go to John Pennekamp instead,50,"Warner Robins, Georgia",3
