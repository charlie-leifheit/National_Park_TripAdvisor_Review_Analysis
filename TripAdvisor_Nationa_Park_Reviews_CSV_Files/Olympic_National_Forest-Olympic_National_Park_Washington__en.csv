Olympic National Forest,"Travelled to many NPs in last five years. Olympic was on our bucket list. Beautiful, but not at the same level as some others (Zion, GC, Acadia, etc). I was somewhat bothered that when ask if the Coho were running to which the entry person suggested where to look. It was October, and the prime season was July for this park. Saw none..should say so.","October 15, 2019",Just Not as Good,57,Omaha NE,4
Olympic National Forest,"There simply aren't enough superlatives to describe Olympic National Park! It is truly fantastic and warrants several days of exploration. One of the cool aspects of the park is that it includes picturesque seashores, rain forests and waterfalls, and mountains rising up to glacier-spiked peaks. The views are tremendous throughout and there is lots of wildlife. If you're a tree-lover, there are spectacular Douglas fir and cedar in amazing rain forests. One of our favorite parks of all!","October 14, 2019",One of America's greatest parks!!,1176,"Bangkok, Thailand",5

Olympic National Forest,"We had only allocated three nights in the forest, and we could have easily spent a week exploring. There is quite a bit of diversity within the park....the Hoh Rainforest, the largest temperate rain forest in the world; beautiful, rough coast line and beaches; hiking abounds, with a stop at Hurricane Ridge a must do; and pristine lakes with kayaking available. We spent two nights in Forks, a funky little town, but a good jumping off place for the Hoh Rainforest and coastal walks, like along Rialto and Ruby beaches. We did not have time to stop at the hot springs in Sol Duc...that looked like fun, so maybe next time. We drove along Lake Crescent, and could have easily have stayed there a night. After Forks, we stayed along Lake Quinault and did some great hiking in the rainforest up the mountain from our motel. We did a loop along the whole peninsula. The roads are good, though we did get stuck for a bit as they were doing some repaving and the distances were easy drives. The driving time from Seattle to Forks is about three and a half hours. We diverted to drive up to Hurricane Ridge. The drive from Forks to Quinault was about an hour and a quarter. Quinault to Mount Rainier was just under four hours.","September 17, 2019",Lots to Do....Too Little Time,65,"Charlottesville, Virginia",4

For as highly rated as Olympic National Park is, it’s doesn’t draw the crowds other esteemed National parks do, making it an ideal destination for your next journey. The park has a few dispersed Visitor Center’s that all offer easy short hikes that quickly submerses you into the Rain Forest experience. The park also offers 3 resorts and several campgrounds but the surrounding towns also offer affordable lodging and have plenty of virtues of their own.

The view from hurricane ridge and lake crescent is gorgeous but it's not worth the drive. Many cafes are closed after summer months which makes finding a toilet a huge hassle and long queue. The road works inside is also quite a joke. We waited 20mins and have to convoy 2-3km to drive across a road works which in essence is only 5m.

Olympic National Forest,"First, the Quinault Rain Forest is just amazing. All that rain! And all the vegetation. Wow!OK, now for the hike. This is an easy loop trail that goes through the forest to an old homestead. It begins at the north shore Ranger Station (which was closed when we were there. Rats!). Almost immediately on leaving the parking lot, you are thrust into the rain forest. Like I mentioned, lots of vegetation. And lots of ferns (that's a sore spot with me. For years we've tried and tried to grow ferns in our house. Nope. Wouldn't grow. But here. They're like weeds. What did I do wrong?!). The trail is gentle and well worn the whole way. Easy hike. After awhile the trail comes to a bridge where you get your first view of the homestead. The homestead consists of a house, an open barn and several other buildings. Also some farm machinery and a moving van. Why a moving van? Who knows. But makes a neat picture. Would like to have some descriptive panels. Haven't found much about the homestead on the Web. Near the homestead is an apple orchard. The trees are filled with apples (maybe that was one of the homestead's crops). And a bear! Some hikers we met told us that there was a bear in one of the trees. Sure enough. It was getting fat for the winter by munching on some of the abundant apples. Sometimes he was buried deep in the tree so we couldn't see him. Other times, he peeked out and looked at us.

Think of the movie ""The Fog"" - yeah, it was like that - rolling up the mountain and over the street. Creepy-cool! Fog aside, the weather was awesome, we setup for a nice picnic lunch and enjoyed the limited views (fog). We did see several deer and they're used to people being around because one was just 12' away for a picture. Be sure to get a souvenir from the gift shop! Note: While dogs are allowed, they're only allowed in the parking lot area and NOT on trails. I only suggest keeping your dog in your vehicle if the weather is cool (<74'F) and the windows are down a bit. Best way to tell is turn off the car and sit in it for 5-10 minutes to see how warm it gets first. If it's warm for you, it's HOT for your dog.

A doe and her fawn crossed the trail right in front of us. Be advised that parking can be a bit of an issue. We were fortunate to get literally the last available parking spot that we could find in the entire area.

The parks can get busy, but not really crowded (unless maybe in summer?). The ranger stations are helpful with maps, and recommendations for different levels of walking - we did easy trails in each section (walks of 1-2 hours). Serious hikers can take serious hikes as well. One deficit in all of these park entrances was the lack of good, reasonably priced food. Food is available in some of the lodges but it is not good, and very expensive. I recommend that you visit the parks in the morning (before the crowd builds) and bring a packed lunch with you.

Ruby Beach is a must stop for a picnic lunch (no food sold there), and drove on to 2 night stay at Rain Forest Resort Cabins on Lake Quinault. 1000 year old Sitka Spruce is next door. Ate at Salmon House on the grounds-excellent, but go by 5:30 to avoid the rush. Next day explored the fancy and historic Lake Quinault Lodge and the .5 mile Rain Forest Interpretive Nature Trail Loop, worthwhile, easy. Did some local geocaching.

I love to travel for national parks in the USA and this one is definitely at the top of my list to visit again. The trees are huge, and ferns occupy much of the ground not belonging to the trees; whatever isn't actively green already becomes engulfed in a soft, fluffy layer of various mosses. The effect is quite tantalizing for the eyes; the greens are so vibrant! Peaking through the trees you can catch glimpses of mountains, and it's nearly impossible not to stumble across an elk or two here and there.

The first 2 nights, we stayed at a B&B near Port Angeles to visit Hurricane Ridge and some trails including waterfalls. Unfortunately, we had no luck with Hurricane Ridge, the road was partially closed and very foggy and you didn't see anything at all. We saw Crescent Lake and the Elwha Valley and there the demolished dam (impressive) and made hikes to the Madison Falls, Marymere Falls and Sol Duc Falls. The other two nights we stayed in Forks to see the coast and the rainforest. A very recommendable and not too crowded hike is the way to Cape Flattery. We also hiked Rialto Beach, Second Beach and Ruby Beach. The beaches are really beautiful and you think you are in another world, with alluvial wood and fog - really surrealistic. We were a tiny bit disappointed of the Hoh Rain Forest. But it may also be because we were already in the Mount Rainier National Park on this vacation and the forest there with the giant trees looked pretty similar for someone like me with untrained eyes and I expected something very special.

You may see herds of elk wandering up the river bar, or a bear or cougar crossing the road in front of you. This is a place of such beauty, it will definitely be a memory you will treasure. Take a raincoat though, it is not called a Rain Forest for nothing. You can tell the locals from the tourists because the locals don't use an umbrella.

Anyway, we got to Hurricane Ridge and inside the center was another great gift shop with a small sit-down place to eat next to it... ok to mediocre food with high prices but the view of Hurricane Ridge out the window as you sat & ate was nice. Also right outside the window as you ate was snow that was piled up beautifully making it like a winter wonderland scene. During the drive thru this park we saw some trees which had some kinda hairy looking moss stuff on them which makes the trees look scary but still beautiful! Only GOD could do that!

Try to find local cabins and motels. The hotels listed on the National Park website are owned by Aramark and are not taken care of properly. Also only the visitor centers are staffed.

Olympic National Forest,"Olympic National Forest and Olympic National Park are two different areas.I am writing this review because the details were quite interesting to me.Olympic National Forest is a U.S. National Forest with an area of 628,115 acres; it surrounds Olympic National Park and the Olympic Mountain range and includes the Lake Quinault area, parts of the Forks area, the Hood Canal area, Dungeness and Wynoochee.When I was driving from Aberdeen to Lake Quinault Lodge, I was very surprised that there was no little booth to pass through to pay a fee. Fees to enter are only charged in the National Park.The rules in national forests are very different than in national parks, which is why it is important to differentiate the two.In Olympic National Forest there are no wilderness backpacking permits or fees, your dog is allowed on trails, target shooting is allowed in designated areas and hunting & fishing is managed by the state’s Fish & Wildlife regulations. Seal Rock campground on the Hood Canal allows harvesting of oysters for personal consumption--there is a daily limit.You can pick wild berries in the late summer months and harvest personal quantities of medicinal herbs, mushrooms, edible fruits and nuts and other natural products. Many times there is not even a charge involved and they can offer you a free use permit.I also read a brochure that it is permissible to cut oneself a load of logs for the fireplace. There is a charge involved, but it is also minimal.In Olympic National Park, the roads are generally well traveled and in good shape. They surround the park (Route 101) and radiate like spokes into the park, but they do not connect. Most of Olympic National Park is untouched wilderness.In the national forests, there are many winding gravel roads that crisscross the forest, with limited access for the average car. Forest Service roads are labeled with road numbers. I noticed another review in which the occupants of a car set forth on a one way road, got lost and could not turn around.These roads are often so rough they're not safe to drive on. A road could get flooded or have a tree fall across it and it can be days before someone, like a wood cutter, finds you and rescues you; there is no cell phone reception in the forest.Both the Olympic Park and Olympic Forest are magnificent.This was my first time on the Olympic Penninsula and I loved every minute of the ten days I spent there, moving back and forth from the National Forest into and out of the Park.Luckily, I am a senior and had my National Parks Pass and that served me well.This may be too much information for most people, but I noticed a lot of the reviews referring to places in the park, rather than the forest.So, I thought I would be a little more factual.I did not know any of this before speaking to the rangers.","August 22, 2017","A Fabulous Place, but Different than Olympic National Park",582,toronto,5

The rocks were getting bigger and we had no clue what we were driving ourselves into. 20 minutes later we see a bear run infront of us and thats were we thought (We are doomed). We ended up driving all the way up and reached the dead end and got to turn around Finally... Please be careful and don't drive anywhere with no further signs. Im glad we had enough fuel and the tires didn't blow up because of the rocks...The Mountains are certainly beautiful but we should remember that we are in the wild and in the home of the big animals.

A long strip of the park runs up the coastline and includes forested areas, sand and/or pebble beaches, sea stacks and islands, and on occasion, tide pools. The bulk of the park occupies the central portion of the penninsula and includes areas as diverse as high-altitude Hurricane Ridge, the Hoh Rain Forest, and Lake Crescent. Each area is somewhat different from the rest, and each is stunningly beautiful in its own way. There are few national parks that contain areas as diverse as this one. Check the Olympic National Park website for details on each area and for information about the various NPS lodges, road closures, construction work, weather conditions, etc. Whether you go for a day or a week, you'll love every minute.","July 28, 2017",Diverse and spectacular,287,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

Olympic National Forest,"This was one of the best trips we've ever had to a national park and we have been to many of the great ones, such as GSMNP, Rocky Mountains, Tetons, Yellowstone, Yosemite, etc. I am thankful we had 3 full days and two nights in the park and wouldn't have wanted to have stayed less; in fact if we had it to do over, we would have stayed at least one less day in Seattle and explored here. We drove up one morning from Seattle and enjoyed the Visitor's Center in Port Angeles, then drove up to Hurricane Ridge in a thick fog that lifted a few miles from the top. Then, took a leisurely drive to Lake Crescent where we stayed the night and enjoyed the stunning setting and relaxed. The next day, we hiked to Marymere Falls, drove to the Hoh rainforest and visited Ruby Beach, and drove on the Kalaloch Lodge for the night. We enjoyed Kalaloch that evening and until noon the next day and then returned to Port Angeles to catch the 5:30 ferry to Victoria (and added in another trip up to Hurricane Ridge). We were blessed with stunning weather and were constantly amazed at this park. The only thing that is different and weird is how you aren't really in the park all the time---you are constantly skirting around the park on sometimes not scenic 101, and go in and out of park areas, so you can lose that feeling of being really away from it all. But, as soon as you enter the park areas, you are enveloped and the diversity is absolutely amazing. If at all possible, stay in one of the park properties instead of in the surrounding towns. It is a huge park with long distances so count on a lot of driving and don't plan too much in one day.

Olympic National Forest,"Starting from Staircase Ranger Station Parking Lot, the trail head is super easy to find (map by the pit toilet). I figured I could cover 2.9 miles out and then 2.9 miles back in about 2.5 hours as I waited for my backpacking friends to arrive. I realize it has 3,200 feet of elevation gain, but I felt fit on a cool spring day.I was wrong to try and hike this in so short a time, especially with no water and no food. I spent a little over 2 hours heading up hill and then turned back at a massive pine tree pile up. Never made it to the Wagon Wheel Lake but I wanted to give a warning for those hubristic hikers like me who try to tackle this as a morning or afternoon jaunt without adequate preparation.What's amazing about this hike?Easy to follow trail (all switchbacks - VERY steep).You pass through THREE different temperate regions - easy to tell as trees and vegetation change.Saw a barred owl (at 1530! Go figure) - never been this close to one - totally silent as it flew away after regarding me for over a minute from its perch 20 feet above me. Highlight of the hike!I'll try to emphasize how steep this is - when I started: again, no pack, no gear, no water :( I was anticipating 3 miles per hour power striding up the hill. My expectation was quickly dialed back - I walked about 1.5 miles per hour by the top. Slooooow! Had to pause every 200 yards or so to catch my breath once I got to the pine needles only spot.Coming back down (I think I made it 2.75? No signs, no mile markers, and I didn't have a map) I bonked, so just did my best to jog without falling.BTW - the trail is officially ""closed"" while they look for a missing hiker (Zach Krull). My thoughts go out to his family and I hope he is found soon.So...if you're in Olympic National Park looking for easy day hikes stay on the Skokomish trail or tool around the river / Lake.","April 30, 2017",Wagon Wheel Trail Hike - Massive Elevation Gain,44,"Portland, Oregon",4
Olympic National Forest,"My daughter and I spent a week hiking in the park. We stayed in a great little house in Sequim and went for day hikes. This was early in season so many trails were still snowed in but still plenty to keep us busy. Some highlights included Hoh rainforest, Rialto Beach and we were lucky enough to have a sunny day for breathtaking views of Cape Flattery. Will definitely return. * A word of advice for those going on Storm King Trail. It is STEEP. I was happy for the work out and it's beautiful. What I wasn't ready for is how spooky it is at the very top. For a non-rock climber like myself it seemed pretty precarious. Even my fearless daughter (18 yrs old) got a little freaked out at the top and elected to pass on the final hundred or so feet to top. In my trail guide it was rated a 3 out of 5 for difficulty!? This is a different scale than I would expect for casual day hikes. To be fair I don't like heights much but I don't think to a unreasonable degree. As we began to ascend the last two-three hundred feet I couldn't bring myself to look anywhere but where my hands and feet were planted and try not to focus on the rocks skittering and falling a LONG way down. Had we slipped it would have been pretty bad news for family at home! I wouldn't recommend this for families with young children if you're not used to some real climbing or people with a fear of heights -at least if you feel you need to make it to the summit. Perhaps the trail isn't technically all the way to the top but it doesn't show an end; people have obviously kept going so you feel you are still on it.

Olympic National Forest,"Our trip to Olympic NP was only one day. One day is definitely not long enough!It was a foggy/cloudy day, which made the drive up to Hurricane Ridge interesting, but it was so worth it. The views from the top were stunning! You can see most of the peaks from Hurricane Ridge including Olympus and one of its glaciers. There is a cafe, shop and visitor center up there with lots of great information. You can do several hikes from up there as well.There is a $25 fee to get in the park. It is a week long pass. If you plan to visit other parks in the area though, just get the annual pass for $80. It will get you in to any national park for a year.One day is definitely not enough time at Olympic NP. I am itching to get back and tackle more of it.

Olympic National Forest,"We started in the city of Port Angeles, which allowed easy access to Hurricane Ridge (a 17 mile ride up a steep winding road). This is the most popular section of the park. It has mountains and alpine meadows which are stunning (bring extra layers of clothes though since it is very chilly up there, even in June). We then constantly continued driving counter clockwise on Route 101, the road that encircles most of this almost 1 million acre park. We did short hikes to some beautiful waterfalls, and went to Crescent Lake. From there we spent a few nights in Forks which was convenient for seeing the beaches and rainforests of the park. The Hoh rain forest has several trails leading through the amazing forests covered in thick moss and lichen. Very different from forests found throughout most of the rest of the USA. There are several beaches to chose from, but our favorite was Second Beach. You have to hike into the beach through the woods, and then climb over the driftwood on the border of the forest and the beach, but you will be rewarded with lots of beautiful views, including the sea stacks (huge rock towers rising out of the water). If you go during low tide you can also see the awesome tidal pools filled with seastars, anemones, crabs, and other marine life. Rialto Beach and Ruby Beach offer beautiful rock formations and views as well, and don't require a hike through the woods to access them. Third beach is a very long (and rather steep) hike through the woods. We spent 4 days at this amazing park and still didn't get to see it all. It's one of the best national parks we have.

The drive from the main road into the Hoh Rainforest is longer than you'd expect, but it's a beautiful drive in, with several shops and restaurants on the way.2.

Olympic National Forest,"Never been to the northwest before. Spent 5 days here. 3 days of rain & 2 sunny days. Locals said they are in a drought..... didn't look that way to us. Came mostly prepared with rain jackets, but could have used rain pants too. Anyway, the rain didn't stop us. Mostly toured the west & north areas. The best places were the Hoh rain forest (appropriate for the weather), Ruby & Rialto beaches, Sol Duc and Marymere falls and Cape Flattery. There's lots of reasonably priced lodging around Forks besides the motels. We stayed at Quillayute River Resort. I thought Hurricane Ridge was overrated, but that's just me. Lots of great reviews of these places, so I didn't review. Could easily spent more time here.","November 5, 2015",A National Park Jewel.,66,"Cleveland, Ohio",5

Olympic National Forest,"The trail head to Hurricane Hill is a little over a mile past the Hurricane Ridge Visitors Center. It is worth the extra time and effort. From the trail head the hike to the two overlooks on Hurricane Hill is around 1.5 miles. While there are very good views from Hurricane Ridge, the Hike to Hurricane Hill gets you higher and provides an almost 360 degree view of the Olympic Mountains to your east and south and the Straight of Juan de Fuca to the north. On clear days Victoria, Canada and Mount Baker are easily visible. With clear weather the sunrise is spectacular. Unfortunately I didn't time my visit early enough to capture the glory of the pre-sunrise, but I arrived at the top at the same instant that the sun crested the horizon and bathed the mountain tops in a golden glow. My visit was the first weekend in the fall. I was the only person on the mountain for the first three + hours and it was breath-taking... and pretty chilly. The trail is actually paved almost all the way making it very easy from a footing standpoint. It has some fairly steep stretches, but nothing that I would classify above a moderate challenge. The black-tailed deer are plentiful and very tame. I did not see any mountain goats, but there were plenty of warnings not to approach them if you do see them. I think my pics tell the story better than my feeble words.One positive was I arrived late in the afternoon on Saturday. I was prepared to pay the $20 fee, but there was no one at the entrance gate. I went on in, visited the Visitor's Center and then hiked up to Hurricane Hill to scout out my early morning photo shoot. I arrived so early the next morning that the entrance booth was again unmanned. My cost for the two visits was the gas money to drive up to the top of the mountain. It takes about 30 minutes to drive up from Port Angeles. While there is a small snack bar at the Visitor's Center there is not a huge selection and it is not open for very long hours. I suggest bringing your own food and drink.","October 19, 2015","Hike to Hurricane Hill for Sunrise,",40,South Carolina,5

The trail follows the Skokomish River and provides the visitor with un-paralleled beauty. The huge variety of mushroom species that we were able to see was just spectacular.

Unknow to us a storm was brewing and just a few miles into park trees were falling over the road. We were able to move the first obstacle but then were stopped by ranger a few more miles in as a huge tree had fallen. Fotunately there was the ""hike of the ancients"" right beside us so off we went with our daughter and son in law. Beautiful forest and creek with ferns everywhere. Very easy hike. When we were finished the road had been cleared so off we went to the hot springs... It was closed as electric was out and road had been closed again. Tried to get out of park (by this time the wind was howling!) Park rangers came with chain saws to clear the two huge trees and we made it out of park. Our ferry had been cancelled so drove to ferry that goes to Seattle. Not exactly the experience we had hoped for but exciting none the less and we made it back to Whidbey Island safely!

Olympic National Forest,"Imagine a place with an abundance of natural wonders in one place: ocean beaches, lakes, mountains, hot springs, waterfalls, trees and more trees—and rain forests! It’s the Olympic National Park in the northwest corner of the United States on Washington’s Olympic Peninsula. It was amazing to be on an ocean beach and five minutes later, crossing US 101, be in the middle of a quiet forest of giants. I felt honored to be able to walk through the forests, my head raised constantly trying to see the tops of the trees. It’s reminiscent of the California Redwoods, but with a difference: there’s moss! After all, we are in the middle of a rain forest! We went on to the South Shore Drive of Lake Quinault one day and walked the “Rain Forest Nature Trail” in the forest and along the lakeshore. It started to sprinkle so we ate our picnic lunch in the car but then the weather cleared and we drove on and saw the Lake Quinault Lodge which everyone raves about. Each area of the park has the beautiful lodges you would expect in National Parks, and each one is different.  Olympic National Park is divided into two pieces - one very large area in the center of the Olympic Peninsula and another smaller piece along the ocean. The Hoh Rain Forest, on the west side, receives more than 240 inches of rain annually. The mountain range is in the middle, and interestingly, the eastern leeward side of the mountains gets less than 20 inches of rain a year, thus allowing a wide variety of plants and animals to exist in the same park.

Since I am a senior I purchased a nat park admissions card good for me and anyone in my car good for the rest of my life. Quite a bargain for 10 dollars. A friendly park ranger helped with a hike that was within our abilities. We took a 3mile round trip hike with a vertical climb of 700 ft. This took us to the top of hurricane hill an elevation of 5757ft. We lucked out and had a mild and sunny day. The view at the top was spectacular. From snow covered mt Olympus to Canada across the strait of juan de Fuca. There are loads of other hikes and drives for every level of traveler. Well worth the effort if the weather cooperates.

There were real hikers and also people with little children everyone made it just fine.At the top there were little chipmunks waiting and begging for food!We gave them part of a sandwich...I think they like P&JMost exciting thing to us was the majestic snow caps, being from Texas it's not something we get to see a lot of.We also saw several black bears, they were going through the trash cans looking for food.Over all I give it an A..

Olympic National Forest,"The Olympic Forrest is a beautiful place where grey skies are your friend. In fact a light rain makes for even better photos.That's because, even diffuse light, makes the greens and the forest canopy/mosses pop and almost glow in your photos. Here's a few additional pointers for great shots.1. Avoid having any sky bleeding through your photos. It's too bright. Find a what to take a picture with only foliage or something other than sky in the background.2. To get a photo of the entire forest, try shooting with a tripod and using a small aperture. A wide angle lens (16-25mm range) is just ticket...big depth of field does wonders to capture the feeling.3. You can also take advantage of ops to get close up photos of leafs (backlighting works wonders), singular trees of interests...etc. Longer glass (90mm+) works great...try using a large aperture for these and throw your background out of focus.","September 23, 2015",Pro photographer's tips for taking great shots inside the forest,108,"Arlington Heights, Illinois",5

We camped the first night at Kalaloch Campgrounds which is not in the database for Tripadvisor. It's on the coast and dog friendly. The beach is very open and wide and not very crowded even though we were there at the end of July/first of Aug. The camp sites are small so some won't fit more than 1 tent. They're obscessed about not parking on the dirt (only on cement) so we had to park sort of diagonally to fit 2 cars. We never have trouble at OR camp sites but it may be a national parks thing. They have some sites that overlook the ocean which I'm sure are coveted and taken very early. Try for it though. We also stopped at the rain forest, the lakes and the peak of Hurricane Ridge. Each place is unique and worth a visit. As I said in the Hoh rainforest review and the Hurricane Ridge review, they each have 18 ml drive into the visitor's center.

Olympic National Forest,"My husband and I had a business trip in Seattle, and we decided to stay over the weekend to visit Olympic National Park. We are SO glad we did! We drove to the park early in the morning from our hotel in Port Angeles. The drive into the park is lovely; you can see the snow-capped mountains all along the road. Do stop at the Visitor's Center first - the volunteers are incredibly helpful and passionate about the park and forest. They'll ask you how much time you have and help you structure your trip so you see what you want. We were advised that, since we would be driving and wanted to see as much as possible, we should head out to the beaches first, then Hurricane Ridge and the rainforest. It's a lot of driving but we wanted to see the three major ecosystems (high mountains, beach, rainforest).The first day we drove out to the beach on the western edge of the park. The waves were high and it was windy and cold - not ideal for sunbathing but perfect for hiking. We scrambled over huge logs and driftwood and it was all-around gorgeous. The next day we drove out to Hurricane Ridge and hiked the trail there. The view is breathtaking; save time for a ton of pictures! It was snowy when we were there and a lot of hikers wore bad footwear - I think the trail seems easier than it is. Make sure you wear hiking boots or at least a good pair of walking shoes. It took us about two hours to complete, but there were other branches of the trail so you could easily spend a day there. Finally, we drove down to the Hoh Rainforest. It was early evening by the time we arrived and we spent an hour walking the beautiful trail through the Gallery of Mosses. It was such a joy to see three hugely different environments in three days.If you want to see as much as possible, be prepared to spend a lot of time driving. If we had more time we would have hiked much more but we wanted to see all of the major attractions. It took us about five hours to drive from Seattle so this is definitely not a one-day trip.

There wasn't any rain when we went in June but there was a warm front and it was considerably warmer than usual, still beautiful though. We also drove up the 17 miles to Hurricane Ridge. There is a short hike (less than a mile and you can get some other pretty views). Take the time to listen to the Park Ranger's presentation. It might seem geared for children, but it is quite informational. We didn't stop at Crescent Lake, but we drove past it on 101, taking time to get pictures of the scenic view.

Olympic National Forest,"In my opinion, Olympic NP is truly majestic and underrated among the other national parks for its beauty and diversity. Not sure why it isn’t on top of my places to visit sooner. It is about a 3 hours’ drive north west of Seattle. We first visited Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center as most folks have suggested. We did the Hurricane Hill trail as it was listed as one of the must do trail. The hurricane Ridge has no wind anywhere close to a breeze so it makes it very pleasant for hiking. It is a about 4 miles round trip with a 760 ft. elevation gain but totally worth it. As some other visitors have indicated, don’t be satisfied with the scenery at the visitor center. The best is yet to come if you are willing to hike a little bit. The scenery also changes as you go up. It sorts of resembles Austria to me with the sweeping mountain and cloud forest. I was not expecting to see cloud forest at this elevation and it was amazing . If you are lucky enough like us, you may be able to see a bit of blue sky and a few deer roaming around. We were truly blessed with the weather during our 5 days there. To sum up, you can catch the mountain scenery at Hurricane Ridge, the coastal/ Beaches scenery at the many beaches, Ruby Beach, Rialto beach, Second beach, Third beach, various waterfalls ( Marymere Falls, Sol Du Falls) and finally the rainforest at Hoh Rain Forest and Quinault Rainforest. These are all different habitat and all exist in one park. The drive is long getting from one place to another but 101 is paved and very well maintained. Plus the roads have been dotted with yellow flowers on both sides that make the drive a destination itself. Also consider visiting some of the historic hotels inside the park such as Lake Crescent Lodge, Lake Quinault, Kaloch lodge and have a quick bite there or simply chill at one of the lawn chairs to watch the calming lakes. In contrast, the coastal beaches has many actions as the high tide came in. Olympic is pretty and most majestic when it is covered with the fog and cloud and its beauty that cant’ be found in many national parks. Bring your rain jacket and pack your bag to come to explore this park. The park has a variety of trails for all fitness levels. There are in fact a few wheel chair accessible trails at the popular sites.","May 27, 2015",Majestic National Park - Put it on your travel list,94,"Sunnyvale, California",5
Olympic National Forest,"Okay, I live on the Oregon coast in a rural area. So I'm used to lots of green forests everywhere. Still, I had hoped that this area -- being a National Park -- would be more impressive. There are pretty areas, yes indeed, but *overall* to me it was just okay.The really pretty sections are far apart. There is lots of driving on the main highway which does not go through big trees. To get to many of the pretty areas, you have to drive on a side road for a half hour or so. At least the major side roads are paved!There are lots of young, vigorous growing forests that looks to be well managed. There are a few areas here and there that have been cut and not yet replanted, but they are all *small* acreages -- less than 20 acres per cut area in my estimation. Sometimes managed forests leave small open areas to let them regrow naturally... it's all part of forest management.Although you don't have to hike, those who are able, willing, and have enough time to seriously hike to explore Olympic NP may have a better experience.","May 21, 2015",I know I'm in the minority . . . but was not wowed,2876,Oregon Coast,3

We also enjoyed several hikes in the area!A few tips:- The site was further than we had realized from the nearest town, Port Angeles. Don't pass Port Angeles with an empty tank.- Only stop at the ranger station to purchase your park fees if it's open (we found their ""out of office"" signage a bit confusing). Best to just go to the resort where the friendly staff will help you.- The campsite has water and (clean) toilets, but no showers, so the hot springs is your best bet.- Since it was April/May, we hit snow on all of our hikes.

This is the 2nd trip up for us & it was really difficult, but terrific!The climb is a steep pitch with switchbacks for a little over 4 miles one way.You start out in an old growth forest with a waterfall tinkling away in the background. It's nice to be in the shade whilst acclimating to the rigorous journey.There were tons of Rhododendron plants in the first half that will be blooming in a few weeks, so I'd definitely recommend mid-May as a great time to brave this venture, plus there will be a solid carpeting of wildflowers which were just beginning to peak out along the trail this weekend.I understand that this is really early in the season for this hike to be accessible, & we did run into a few snow/ice/slush patches. Much more than that, it would not be recommended because of the steep climb, but we did this hike in our running shoes.There is a picturesque shallow lake half way up (frozen over this time) & the last half of the climb you are switch back overlooking Puget Sound, the San Juan Islands, the Cascade range, Mt. Rainer, Mt. Baker, & Seattle.Lovely!We took a picnic & wine up & enjoyed it on the Ridge overlooking it all.Take sunblock & bug repellent, as I got an unfortunate capri-pants sunburn & there were already Nosie's out.

Olympic National Forest,"Really nice drive into the park. Very majestic with the tall pine trees. The park reminds me of the Blue Ridge Mountains in the Carolinas with all of the green trees (but much bigger!) - but the snow capped mountains in the backdrop made me do a double take. The hike was a little more than I expected - it was paved but there is a slow incline that made me realize my life of beer and cheese in Wisconsin might be better served with a little less junk food intake. My military son and his PE teacher fiance sailed right past us while I kept having to stop because of the altitude and nausea (it's about a mile up), slow incline, plus I had forgotten my inhaler. I'm only 25 pounds over my ideal weight, but it made a huge difference for me on this trail. Once we made it to the top the view was breathtaking and well worth having to stop a few times to catch my breath. If you are physically fit the hike shouldn't be a concern, but if you don't do any type of aerobic activity to increase your lung capacity, be prepared to take awhile to get to the top.

I didn’t get out, though. The air that afternoon was quite chilly, and I wasn't quite over the flu/bronchitis.

Olympic National Forest,"Kalaloch camp Olympic National ParkDid you guess? It rained.Kalaloch (pronounced- “ku-lay-lock” mostly losing the “u”) is a beautiful spot. My wife tells me it is the #1 ranked camping destination in Washington. It is the only campground in the Olympics done by reservation. Walk-ins are possible when there are cancellations, we were told this is rare. It is beautiful, but it is no where near number one in my book. It is crowded, camp sites are small, and if you are on the 101 side it be ready for lots of car noise. Even though the beach access and the beach at Mora were not as good, we enjoyed our days at Mora more.So we were lucky enough to get sites in August for two nights, a Wednesday and Thursday. Sadly our site were on the 101 side of this campground that is wedged between the highway and the ocean. Under the trees, it rains long after the rain has stopped. I am guessing the fog/sea layer simply accumulates on the trees to create a constant state of rain. When I walked out from under the tree cover where we were camping and getting wet it often was not raining despite evidence to the contrary at our camp site. Bring lots of canopies and tarps and be ready for the wet.I will return if I can get ocean side sites or at least sites off the road, I might even try the Kalaloch lodge. The beach and ocean are phenomenal, I wonder why there weren't surfers. I learned that come to these beaches specifically because of the sand. They eat the organisms in the sand and this sand is preferred. Sadly the whales were further south and not at Kalaloch, but they are often sided in the area for that reason.Noise from other campers is not a problem here. The ocean, rain and road create so much ambient white noise that people can be pretty loud and still not bother one another. That said, I think because of the crowds and proximity the rangers are constantly cruising and this place was very family friendly. I was comfortable letting my 8 and 10year old daughters cruise the place on their bikes.Be prepared there is NOTHING nearby. There is a small general store, a gift shop, and a restaurant at the Kalaloch lodge ¼ mile down the road. The “path” is along highway 101 which is heavily traveled by cars and logging trucks. Not a family friendly walk. For a “convenience” store, it has a great variety of basic goods given its very small size. It has and ice cream/coffee shop plus s'more fixings, beer/wine, ice and wood (7$ a bundle!) and some basic save your trip camping stuff.Bottom line. Come prepared for rain and with everything you need. Don't count on getting a walk. Consider bringing paddle or surf boards and wet suits. Make sure you know the dimensions of camping vehicles because there is little room for error. Travel times are longer than predicted by Google.

Olympic National Forest,"We took the counter clockwise loop around ONP, and it was just what we needed for a vacation. Lots of green, tall trees, lakeside playing, back to nature. Kids (age 3,1) took advantage of the relatively long driving for naps. We stayed at Sol Duc, Lake Crescent and Lake Quinault Lodge one night each. We can probably extend our vacation longer to enjoy each place, but one night each was doable. We did short hikes: Marymere, Sol Duc waterfall. Food is expensive as we found afterwards, so I advice packing your own breakfast and/or lunch. Quinault was the most comfortable lodge in my opinion, but Lake Crescent offers a different peaceful lakeview. Sol Duc offers those who stays at the lodge an hour of close to public hot spring hour in the morning (at 9 I think). So relaxing. The pool at Quinault is heated and indoors, which is awesome!","September 16, 2014",4 Days in Olympic National Park with Kids,8,memorybau,4

It's only a half hour from Shelton or an hour from Olympia, The worst part is the couple mile gravel section of the road to the Ranger Station. Other than that, it was great. Although it was raining lightly, once we got onto the trail, the forest canopy kept the rain off us. The trails are primitive with ups and downs; twists and turns and a couple of muddy spots. The bridges are awesome with super photo ops. There are a number of trails you can take. We only saw a couple groups of middle school students hiking with their teachers and a few joggers. I heard deer or elk in the brush, but never saw one.

The visito center is well maintained. We can see snow clad mountains/glaciers from here on a clear sunny day. We really enjoyed hescenic beauty of the place.

Olympic National Forest,"This park is beautiful with many different ecosystems within it. We had done research on how long it would take us to drive around the park and decided to plan for roughly two days. We left Cannon Beach, OR the morning of our first day and made it into the park by Lake Quinault around noon. We had planned to spend our first night in Forks, thinking it would be a good resting point. We easily made it to Forks with time to spare. We stopped at each of the main attractions along the way (Ruby Beach, Hoh Rainforest and La Push). The next morning we left and made it through the rest of the attractions up to Port Angles (Lake Crescent, Hot Springs, & Hurricane Ridge) by 2pm. From Hurricane Ridge, we did not drive down the eastern or southern part of the park as we didn’t see any main attractions that interested us. Instead, we drove down to Bainbridge Island to take the ferry back to Seattle. All in all, if your plan is just to hit all of the highlights (walk around, take some photos and keep moving) you could do this in one day. We did not do any hiking other than the minimal amounts required at each destination to see what the highlights were.","August 26, 2014",Can do the park in one day!,24,Wisconsin,5

As it was, we were forced to pick and choose from all of the opportunities. Be sure to have your Discover Pass handy as most of the sights require it. Hiking or walking are required at most if not all of the points of interest in the park so if that isn't what you're into, you may not want be interested. Hurricane Ridge for its views of the Olympic Mountains, Strait of Juan de Fuca, and British Columbia is a must. We bypassed Sol duc Hot Springs as we've heard it's not much more than heated swimming pools, however the falls are supposed to be quite pretty. Lake Crescent's Marymere Falls was another stop well worth the short hike. The windy, chilly Rialto Beach's sea stacks and driftwood-littered beach is a sight to see. We intended to hike a few miles north to Hole in the Wall but timed the tides wrong. The Hoh Rain Forest with its incredible moss-draped trees and ferns is a must visit. According to the ranger at the Kalaloch Ranger Station, Ruby Beach and Beach 4 are the best beaches to check out the tide pools. Supposedly, there are no tide pools further south. We spent a few hours at low tide on the sands and rocks of Beach 4. Lots of anemones, sea stars, barnacles, and razor clams.

And it's a very easy walk from your car to the beach. Take a picnic lunch and spend the afternoon. Next, go to the Hoh Rain Forest. You have to stop and get pictures of the biggest spruce tree you've ever seen. It's gigantic. We didn't hike any of the trails at the rainforest, but there are several that lead to water falls. Then, go to Cape Flattery. Everything says this is an easy 30 minute hike, but that's just not true. It took us two hours over some very difficult terrain. But, I will tell you the view is well worth it plus you will have reached the furthest northwest point in the United States. Then, you have to drive up to Hurricane Ridge. Here you can see forever.

The views of Puget Sound, Rainier, downtown Seattle, the Olympics and Cascades are unlike anything we've seen in our world travels. Truly breathtaking with Mt Rainier in all its glory. Hood Canal is loaded with fantastic seafood such as crab, shrimp, oysters, clams, and geoduck (look up a photo of a geoduck!). Fabulous finds in the way of restaurants in the Brinnon area, along with amazing hiking, kayaking, wineries, distilleries, swimming without the worry of an under tow, and wildlife like no where else we've been on the water of Hood Canal. especially near Dosewallips State Park. This area is also waterfall heaven!! NOTE: Olympic Natl Park does NOT allow dogs, and they will turn you away if attempting to enter with a dog. Olympic Nat'l Forest DOES allow dogs, so if bringing a canine family member Olympic National Forest is much more easily accessible than north and west sides from our experience.

The dinner was expensive but food was delicious and the veiws at sunset were amazing. If you don't stay for dinner, buy a drink and sit outside on the chairs by the lake to enjoy the view at sunset or stars at night. Accodation like a motel but your not staying in the room much. Lots of hikes up Hurricaine ridge if you park at visitor's center. The weather can change quickly so be sure to stop at the visitor's center at the base of the hill to check out the web cam to see if its worth going the drive to see the view. Riatlo beach and Ruby beach are gorgous. Ho Rain forest is Ok, would not out of my to just see that but if your around there you should go. Camp site that are great are Heart of Hills, Mora, and the best is kalaloch for sleeping on the bluffs next to the water but get there early to reserve a spot. Camping ground in ONP do not have showers but there are several state parks in the area that have quater shower machines. Cape Flattery is worth the drive if the sun is out to go out to the most northwest point of the US (0.75mile hike flat in to the end on boardwalks).

Olympic National Forest,"My husband and I caught the ferry from Anacortes to Port Townsend one evening after dropping down from a week in Canada. We drove to Port Angeles to stay the night at the Royal Victorian. We told the receptionist what our plans were and she told us all the good things to make sure to see as we ringed the park. Our first stop was to Maryanne Falls. It is a short hike to beautiful falls. From there we ventured down to Sol Doc Hot springs, but, wished we hadn't I'm sure it is fine for someone who wants to unwind an hour soaking in hot sulfur water, but it didn't seem that exciting to us. It also seemed pricey to do so. That was all the area offered to we drove back out. This detour cost us an hour and a half. We drove onto Forks to stay the night. We stopped at the visitors hut and discovered Bella's truck from the movie Twilight. We took our obligatory pictures with the cutouts of all the characters. The next morning we went to the beach opposite the inlet of La Plush where the ""werewolves"" of Twilight are originally from. The ""vampires"" are from Forks. The beach is long and expansive and if you get there at low tide you will see many sea anemones along the way. Our next stop was the Hoh Rain Forest. This was absolutely gorgeous. Your hikes will take you across charming little log bridges and you are immersed in a forest dripping with epiphytes. They are moss like-plants that live on top of other living plants such as tree branches. It is a very enchanting place to be. After spending the day hiking throughout this area we made our way out of the park. We stayed in Olympia that night and were ready to hit Seattle's Pike Place Market in the morning.","June 28, 2013",Spectacular tour of Olympic National Park,27,"Henderson, Nevada",5

When we returned to the car we found our window broken out and the pipe to our gas tank cut with most of our gas siphoned out, at least one other wehicle was hit as well. While making the report the officer she told us that this has happened at least 20 times already this year. It was very upsetting. Our items were well hidden, but it didn't matter.The valley was pretty, the river very clear and blue, but the trip is tainted by the theft.
