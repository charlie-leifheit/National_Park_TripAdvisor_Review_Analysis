Arches National Park,Breathtaking - we hiked Delicate Arch and it was well worth the 1.5 miles up and 1.5 miles down. Did it in Oct mid day and was fine - wouldn't want to hike here in the summer,"October 18, 2019",Beautiful Area,9,"Sedona, Arizona",5
Arches National Park,"Arches Natioanal Park is amazing! You can see the sites from your vehicle, or hike (short to long hikes). We hiked to Delicate Arch for the sunset. Beautiful! There are several shorted hikes to arches too.","October 18, 2019",Amazing Scenery,0,,5
Arches National Park,"the challenge trail, in my mind makes this park worth visiting. it is a 7ish mile hike on a little rough ground. Key is taking water with you. wow it is dry, even when it is not hot. There are a lot of arches. It is a little easy to get lost on the trail. leave in time not to hike after the sun goes down","October 18, 2019",lots of arches,18,"Chesterfield, Virginia",5

Arches National Park,We chose to visit Arches National Park since this was the only remaining park in southern Utah that remained on our list. Arches National Park was more than worth the long drive.I am not sure what would be the best time of the day to see Arches National Park. We were there from early afternoon to early evening. I would have liked to see many of the rock formations in either early morning or late evening sunlight. Everything was spectacular even in the harsh light of early afternoon. Definitely stop and take the hiking trails to the different formations. None of the trails were more than a half mile and provided exceptional views of the formations. traffic an be heavy and parking at some of the more popular spots is crowded. We drove through stopping at the view points on the right as we went to the end of the road and then stopped at the other viewpoints on the right when we returned. Total time was just over 2.5 hours including a stop at the visitors center.,"October 17, 2019",Well worth the trip,32,"Sparks, Nevada",5
Arches National Park,The natural arches are breath taking. There are a lot to do and many scenic areas are easily accessible. The hiking trails are a little more challenging that other nearby national parks but are well established and highly hikable.,"October 17, 2019",Amazing work by mother nature and good hiking trails,18,"Boston, Massachusetts",5
Arches National Park,"Drove from Bryce to Aches during the night. It was raining and so dark that I would not advice anyone to drive by themselves. But I enjoyed every bit of the trip there. It was a 4hr drive about 244 miles. To enter the park it’s $30 but I got the $80 card. Best places to see are Park Avenue, Court House, balanced Rock, North & South Windows, delicate Arch and devils arch. ","October 17, 2019",Amazing rock forms/colors ,4,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5

Arches National Park,"Hiked the Devil’s Garden Trail, primitive loop. Rolling hike, about 8 miles. Some scrambling over slick rock. Hard to follow in some places, but not impossible. Incredibly, loop takes you by seven arches. Deep sand in some spots. About 4 hiking hours to complete the full loop. Great day","October 16, 2019",7 arches in one hike,45,"Silver Lake, New Hampshire",5

Arches National Park,"We were at Arches National Park on this late September Tuesday and the park was busy. We used a National Parks Pass that allowed us to enter Arches National Park for free. The regular price is $30 per vehicle.We arrived around 8:30 at the info centre and the parking lot was quite busy.Our first stop was Delicate Arch and on the way up there are amazing rock formations and viewpoints including “Balanced Rock”.We did 2 separate hikes – Delicate Arch and Devil’s Garden plus a drive through the park. Get an information pamphlet and map to plan your visit of the Arches and the viewpoints.Delicate ArchThere is a relatively large parking area with 75+ spots and washrooms. The hike to Delicate Arch from the parking lot is about 5 kilometers (3 miles) return.After a short 2 minute hike from the parking lot you will come to the first attraction – the Wolfe ranch inhabited by an early settler. Within the first 1/4 mile you will walk across a short steel bridge and then maybe a short 100-200 yard walk farther on there will be the petroglyphs loop (dirt and gravel). At this site you will see a rock art panel painted by the indigenous people. You can either see the pictographs before or after seeing the Delicate Arch. This is an easy short loop.On the way up, past the bridge, the first part of the walk is composed mostly of compact dirt and fine sand on a slightly undulating course. About 3/4 mile (1.2 km) in, the trail is on an exposed rock face uphill. About 1.5 kilometer in and for the next 500 meters or so there are rocks and fine sand on the trail. Near the end of the trail, after a short walk (200 yards / 180 meters) on barren rock ledge (fairly wide) your reward will be the freestanding 52 foot tall arch. As expected, it was very busy by Delicate Arch with people taking turns to photograph themselves with this iconic arch. We spent about 30 – 45 minutes up there before heading back down.In my opinion, the open trail hike is strenuous but not difficult; strenuous in the sense you need some cardio fitness but if you take your time, it can be done. If you have mobility issues, it maybe very difficult.We were there in late September on a weekday and the hike and the area around Delicate Arch was very busy. So if you go, plan to go early due to the limited parking at the Delicate Arch parking lot.Devil’s GardenWe got to the Devil’s Garden parking area around 12:00 PM, after the Delicate Arch hike and parking was almost nonexistent. We were lucky to find parking but by 1:30 PM, there were a few empty spots. There is also a separate area for picnic parking.At the trailhead, there are washrooms and a water filling station.The trail is mostly flat with compact dirt and gravel. After a short hike in (about 1 kilometer), there is a 3 way fork - the Landscape Arch trail that goes left, straight ahead is the Pine Tree Arch trail (and less than a 1/2 mile (800 meters) in is the Pine Tree Arch) and the Tunnel Arch to the right. You can see the Tunnel Arch from the fork. Tunnel Arch is not much to see – 2 holes in a rock formation.The hike to Landscape Arch is about 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) from the trailhead at the parking lot. The trail by Landscape Arch is mostly fine sand. Landscape Arch to me was underwhelming once you saw Delicate Arch.In my opinion, Pine Tree Arch is better than Landscape Arch. Since you are already there, you might as well see all 3 arches.In total we hiked about 3 kilometers (2 miles) and spent around 60 minutes here.After that we drove around the national park to see some of the other sites including North and South Window.We came back for photos of the landscape at sunset. The park ranger recommended three spots to watch the sunset - La Sal Viewpoint, Courthouse Towers Viewpoint and Windows. We arrived at 6:15 to look at the recommended sites. We eventually decided to pick our own spot at Balanced Rock (and did not go to Windows) to watch the sunset and take photos. We crossed the road from Balanced Rock for the high vantage point to take photos. I have been told the sunrise is also quite nice as the sun’s rays reflect off the rock formations.I would rate the overall experience 4.5 out of 5.Notes &Tips: • The National Park is about a 10 minute drive from Main Street in Moab. • At the interpretive centre there are washrooms and a gift shop. Pick up your park map here. Plan your visit on the internet before you get here so you’ll know in advance what you want to see. At the centre there is a short 15 minute orientation movie every 30 minutes. • September interpretive centre office hours: 0700 – 1700 • Go early to avoid the crowds • There are over 2,000 arches in the park. Arches must be a certain dimension in order to be considered an arch. • In total we spent about 6 hours in the park • You can easily spend a whole day in the park. If you do, plan to take a picnic lunch and lots of water. • Bring suntan lotion and wear a hat as there is no shade until you get to the very top by the rock formations. During the last week of September it was still hot and sunny. • I would recommend a good pair of trail runners or day hikers and definitely no flip-flops! • There was a good mix of old and young people • We were on our third day of our 13 day Nevada-Arizona-Utah trip. We were off to Canyonlands National Park next. Other national parks we visited on this trip included Bryce Canyon and Zion. See my reviews. • State and private parks we visited included Goblin Valley, Monument Valley, Lower and Upper Antelope and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. See my reviews. • Buy an annual pass if you plan to visit more than 3 national parks in the next 12 months.","October 16, 2019",No McDonald’s Arch - 4.5 out of 5 rating,781,"Richmond, Canada",5

Arches National Park,"During our 8 day drive of 2300+ miles, we stopped first at Arches National Park after arriving in Denver on 10/1. We made it to the park around 4:15, to find out the visitor center was closing around 4:30. After getting a map of the park and purchasing a magnet for our collection, we drove to the various locations within the ANP. It was a beautiful day with clear blue skies, a brisk breeze but temps in the upper 60s to low 70s. The drive is extremely scenic, with various twists and turns that will lead you to some amazing locations that you can view from the roads, or opt to hike a bit to some of the arches. I really enjoyed ""Balanced Rock,"" the windows arches, landscape and delicate arches.

Arches National Park,"In my opinion, this is one of the most beautiful spots in the country. There is a road that runs through the park allowing you to view many of the famous monuments from little pull-offs. You can also get closer to monuments via trails. The park website gives information on the difficulty of the trails, as well as which monuments are better photoed in the morning light or the evening light. I've been here twice, and I plan to come back again. The only two negatives are that tourism has really grown in the last 5 years, so traffic along the main road through town is crowded. Also, for those wanting to avoid crowded restaurants and bad parking, Door Dash hasn't made its way to Moab yet. Pretty minor negatives. Go and bring a camera.","October 9, 2019",Gorgeous,0,Houston,5

If we had been younger and in MUCH better physical condition, I would have loved to hike the 1.5 miles to Delicate Arch (and 1.5 miles back) to get better pictures but the parking lot at Delicate Arch and the paved path to view the arch were adequate for our needs. The parking lot at Delicate Arch was large and there were bathrooms available.The visitor center offered lots of information about the park along with a documentary about the park. Bathrooms at the visitor center were very nice.","October 2, 2019",Beyond Gorgeous,57,"Topeka, Kansas",5

Arches National Park,"There are as many as 2,000 arches here, hence the name. Why? Because you have the right kind of rock, salts beneath that create parallel lines and the right amount of rain and wind to aid in erosion, all combining to create arches over millions of years. Fossils here have been dated to 300 million years ago so this is a very long, dynamic ever-changing process.Much to do and see here. There are many hiking trails and car routes where you can get out and view, participate and enjoy the scenery. It is immense. There are ranger programs, stargazing, camping, climbing, cycling and canyoneering. Spend time at the Visitor Centre. there is a great video highlighting and explaining the area. The staff here are excellent in guiding you according to your needs. We were here pretty early but it was still a busy place. An average of 3,000 people visit per day (more in summer) so plan accordingly.

Honestly though, if you just want a scenic ride without park fees, route 128, which comes down to Moab along the outer boundary of Arches Park is just as stunning with countless pull-offs and camping spots.

Take plenty of water and snacks / food with you. There are only a couple of places to refill your bottles. Wear lace up solid shoes because most of the Arches require a little walk to the view points. Don’t plan on seeing much if your in an RV without a tow vehicle.

I've never seen so many stars, let alone the Milky Way, in my life.The following day we hiked quite a few trails in Arches. We started early, probably around 0700. I'm glad we did, it gets hot out there pretty quick in the Summer. The trails we all pretty easy. Most of them are actually paved/concrete so, if you are looking for handicap accessible, you're in luck.We hit all of the major sites. The Windows, Delicate Arch, Broken Arch, etc. While leaving, pay attention to the signs. I can't remember exactly where it was but, there's a sign that points out Pothole Arch. It was really neat. It lays horizontal. I would've liked to pull over and take a few pictures but, we just kept going.We didn't hike all the way up to Delicate Arch. I think it's like 3 or 4 miles. We were pretty wiped out at this point. We did go to the viewing spots below it though. I will say this, if you decide to go to the upper view point on that trail, it's a pretty steep climb once you get around the beginning bend.

Arches National Park,This place is truly amazing and it is absolutely worth your time and effort to see.Stop at the visitors center and see the movie about how the arches are formed - also worth the time to do.It takes about 3 hours to drive through the park - that’s getting out and taking some pictures but not stopping for hiking. Guide books will tell you to get there before 9am to avoid the most crowds - believe it. ,"September 20, 2019",Spectacular ,209,"Atlanta, Georgia",5
Arches National Park,"It's really amazing to me what time, elements, and location will do for a landscape. Arches was the main National Park that I wanted to see on my recent trip and it didn't disappoint. It was rather warm and I didn't get to hike like I would have liked, BUT what I did see just whet my appetite to come back. I was just amazed by the varied landscape and just the sheer quantity and quality of the arches I did see.","September 20, 2019",Main reason for our two week trip,117,"Olathe, Kansas",5
Arches National Park,"This was a stop on a tour of The Four Corners. You’ve seen the pictures but they don’t do it justice. You have to see it for yourself. Be prepared to do a light to moderate hike to get the best views. Bring lots of water. Like most attractions in the area, there are no real restroom facilities - just put toilets. ***** Stay on the marked trails!!! There is a very fragile micro-ecosystem on the top layer of much of the Park. Stepping on it will cause damage that can take 250 years to repair. We witnessed many foreign tourists who, we guess couldn’t understand the language and were walking where they should not. *****Everyone should see this at least once. You will not regret it.","September 20, 2019",Breathtaking ,22,"Wantagh, New York",5
Arches National Park,"This is an amazing, unique national park, but also very popular. Even in September, when children are back in school, the old folks (like us) come out of the woodwork. Our strategy was to do Arches one day and Canyonlands the next, but there was such a large crowd at the Windows parking that we could not stay, so we came back the next day later in the evening. There is a lot of opportunity for hiking, as most of the interesting places are better viewed close-up. The movie at the visitor center is really fantastic, and just a reminder, folks aged 62 and up can get an $80 pass good for life to every national park, including the whole carful of occupants regardless of age.","September 18, 2019","Everything you've seen in pictures, you see here for real",101,"Ridgeland, Mississippi",5

Arches National Park,"Visited Arches National Park on Tuesday 17 September. The day before, my wife and I could not find a hotel for under $300 in nearby Moab (5 miles away). When we later drove through Moab, there were no vacancies. We had to pay $130 to stay at Comfort Inn in Green River, 40 miles away. Coincidentally on 16 September, the Wall Street Journal published a fascinating piece about hotels and restaurants in Moab being unable to keep up with increased visitor demand at the nearby ""Mighty 5"" Utah National Parks. Arrived at Arches at 11AM Tuesday and waited 21 minutes in line of visitor vehicles to buy park pass and enter. 9AM to 2PM are the most crowded times at the parks. Apparently there is serious overcrowding on weekends and holidays. We found parking lots to be about 95% full, but some vehicle was always leaving as we entered, so we always had a place to park. Arches has no shuttle system like Bryce and Zion. The main road in the park is 18 miles long with a few side roads. There are several parking lots at trail heads and many observation pull outs. But if you can't find a place to park, you still see many scenic spots just by driving through the park. The rest rooms are latrines with no running water. There is no food service in the park. When we left the park at 3PM, there was no line at the entrance.","September 17, 2019","Not too crowded September weekday, but serious hotel shortage",0,"Augusta, Georgia",4

This hike is not for everyone, we did see a couple of people having extreme difficulties with the climb. but if you're somewhat physically fit, shouldn't be a problem. Go early (7:00 or so) beat the crowds and the heat, wear a hat and or sunscreen, take plenty of water and maybe a snack to enjoy at the top. We were up & back by 11:00 which worked out really well before the 100° set in. You can view the Arch from a viewpoint without the climb.

There are also longer, more difficult hikes, if you prefer. There are a number of well placed restrooms and a water station at Devils Garden at the end of the 16 mile Road, otherwise there are no facilities, except at the visitor centre so pack a picnic and plenty of drinks and water.Expect to queue for a parking spot at the most popular 'windows' section of the park.","September 11, 2019",What an amazing national patk,546,"Chichester, United Kingdom",5

Arches National Park,Access to the park is easy.. This was our first time in Moab and we always wanted to visit Arches National Park.. Delicate Arch seems to be the main attraction here. The parking area is about a 15 min drive from the main entrance. The hike is roughly a mile and a half each way and is not.. I repeat not for the faint of heart.. If you have any fear of heights this hike is not for you.. And if you do not watch your step especially around the Arch you can fall a very long way. The hike in my opinion is not for beginners. We left very early in the morning while it was still pretty dark and brought a good flashlight a small back pack with snacks and WATER. It took us about one hour to reach the Arch and we actually got to enjoy the sunrise with only a handful of people.. However on the way down there were tons of people trying to make the hike long after the sun was up and the temp was pushing 90 degrees at 10 am.. If you can't make the hike to Delicate Arch there are still hundreds of places to drive to and enjoy.. Can't wait to go back..,"August 27, 2019",Spectacular... You will not be disappointed....

My husband and I enjoy hiking, but we chose the wrong month to vacation - I do NOT recommend going in the summer. At 109 degrees, it was far too hot to go for a long hike to see any of the actual arches. I wish we had known this before we paid the $30 entry fee! We did the entire drive of the park, but were very disappointed that we couldn’t see much of anything. We were able to see much more driving through Canyonlands, however! I’m sure the park is gorgeous, but in the deathly heat of a Moab summer and without being able to hike, it was a huge letdown. If you are disabled, elderly, unable to hike for whatever reason, I would recommend taking a nice drive around the outskirts of Moab, for scenery that is even more beautiful than just driving through the park.

My memories of that first visit were of calm, beauty, sense of adventure, and immense appreciation. This time around it was pushing, shoving, people cutting in front of you to steal your parking spot, getting in front of you when you try to take a picture, climbing where they shouldn’t, engraving their name in anything from bathrooms to trees to stones. I am thankful I saw this before it was destroyed by the uncaring masses. I am sad I got to see the mismanagement of crowds and vehicles. Maybe it’s time to do what they do in Denali, people can only take busses to enter the park, that way we know where the people are and can better control what they do since they don’t seem to know how to behave respectfully in such an amazing place.

Arches National Park,"You need a couple days to see the highlights of this park. It's hot during the day when most people come in summer, plus the lighting is best in the morning and afternoon before sunset. So I recommend getting up early and chilling out in the middle of the day. Highlights include: Delicate Arch trail: starting an hour and a half before sunset is a good plan to give yourself time to enjoy the view at the top. This is the best trail in the park, IMO. Not as strenuous as it's made out to be. People were being respectful and not going under the arch so as not to spoil everyone else's view... until one person had to get that picture. Then everyone had to do it, of course. There are two short observation point trails that give you a further and closer look at Delicate arch. Nice if you don't feel up for the longer trail, or if time is short, but it's not the same as going up there.Devil's Garden: lengthier trail with six natural arches, the best one at the far end. Probably my second favorite part of the park. Windows Section: easy trail with some very interesting arches, including Double Arch which is very fun to climb.

Arches National Park,"If you're looking to see the sights in this country, the is a must. The other ""must see"" would be Yellowstone. There's no point in me going on where there are thousands of pictures on the web, none doing justice. But here's the deal. If you're speed visiting, start at 7 AM, before the heat, and drive up to the hike to Delicate Arch. Take that walk, then work your way back (or rive up to the end of the park just to see other sights). But there are so many to see on the way out, you'll easily be there until noon and that's way too rushed to see the park. You really want a few days. But we're talking speed tourism here, so leave at noon. Then you can drive over to Dead Horse Point State Prk and see a magnificent Colorado River canyon. Absolutely beautiful. That gives you time to either walk around Moab to see some petroglyphs or Barrier Canyon arts, and then, after a quick dinner, hit a mountain bike trail for an hour.

Wanted to see it again as an adult, so we spent a couple of hours there on our way out of the Moab area. The arches are cool, but the park is so crowded because it's so accessible. We just prefer a few less people.","August 16, 2019","Cool to see, but very busy",45,beachlover8307,3

Arches National Park,"This is a stunning park where we saw the first, but not last, arches of our trip.We went in at 4.30 in the afternoon and it didn’t seem that busy, with just a 5 minute wait for entry. We didn’t see one coach tour so guess they were all back at their hotels. With none of the usual suspects walking around, everyone was really polite and happy to get out of the way so we could all take photos and pretend we were the only ones there – a refreshing change.We particularly loved Delicate Arch, seen from the Viewpoint rather than close up it actually looked more dramatic, and of course Turret Arch and The Windows.We weren’t hiking this time so managed to visit everywhere in one go. Do spend a few hours there.We drove past at 11.30 am the next day and the queue was almost back to the highway.","August 15, 2019",Our First Arches,206,"Manchester, United Kingdom",5

Arches National Park,"It's in my top five. it was number one on this years trip. I've been there 3 times in the last 37 years. Last time was '96. The new Visitor Center was nice and strategically located. The first formations you see when you get to the top are the best.... the Park Avenue and the Courthouse Towers rock formations......my absolute favorites. The rest of the park pales in comparison in my opinion. The rest of the park is definitely worth seeing though. The arches are cool, especially Double Arch and Delicate Arch. Balanced Rock is awesome as well. We were dodging downpours the whole time in the park, but they did not prevent me from getting the photos I wanted to get. I had to go to the Delicate Arch overlook twice to finally get the shot. The first time a downpour started just as I was about to get the shot, so we drove on to Devils Garden and came back to Delicate Arch on our way out of the park. Sun was out with big puffy white clouds in the sky around the Arch. Beautiful! I definitely prefer photographing this arch from a distance rather than taking the hike and being right on top of it. I used a 600mm lens and that brought it in plenty close enough. The weather was too iffy to take the mile hike anyway.....and I'm old and not in shape for such a journey.","August 14, 2019",One of my favorite National Parks,7,,5
Arches National Park,"The park has phenomenal views and trails. The entrance fee ($30, currently) allows you to return for up to seven days. Depending on the crowds and weather, this can be very useful, as seeing the entire park in one day isn't truly feasible if you plan on hiking trails. Weekdays are better for visiting the more popular areas of the park, as weekends get extremely busy, and the lines to just find a parking spot can be insane. Window Arches was so busy on a Saturday that it wasn't feasible to wait to hike up to them, so plan on trying to go during the week, if possible. Definitely remember to bring plenty of water and apply sunscreen often, as the elevation makes sunburn that much easier and more intense, and the dry climate, especially during the hottest summer months, will leave you dehydrated quickly. There is free filtered water available outside the visitor center at the entrance, so remember to bring your own reusable water bottles to avoid paying for water and then having to hike out the bottles for recycling.","August 13, 2019",Great views,24,"Flossmoor, Illinois",4
Arches National Park,"This place was beautiful. I read lots of reviews about it being crowded during 9a-4p and that was very true. We were there 3 times and once arrived at 10am and waited 20 minutes to get in the park. One day we arrived around 730a and there were only 2 cars infront of us. We picked this day to see the windows and had good luck parking, but by the time we left there were long lines and no parking spaces. One evening we went to pine tree arch and only saw about 10 others hiking. Be sure to take lots of water. Our littles loved the hiking and the views were gorgeous. We did mostly easy trails with kids and they had no trouble.","August 13, 2019",Beautiful arches,5,"Canyon, Texas",5

Arches National Park,"Yes, you can hike the Fiery Furnace without a Ranger if you can get hold of the day permit from the visitor centre, but why would you miss the opportunity to have an expert guide, for an incredibly cheap price. We booked our places on the first tour (9:00) months before we left the UK. Good idea. There were only about 12 people in our tour group. Our guide was Ranger Martin Tow. He was simply incredible. Our two kids are 6 and 8 and they made friends with an equally adventurous 6 year old from another family. Martin was great with the kids and adults alike and I have to say that the kids probably did a lot more exploring and scrambling than they would have done if we were simply hiking the Fiery Furnace as a family. He took us to such a range of fascinating features that we’d never have found without him. We saw lots of other family groups who were exploring/hiking/lost in the Fiery Furnace that morning. No one was learning as much or having such a great time as us. Thanks for an amazing trip Martin!","August 12, 2019",Don’t miss the Ranger Led Fiery Furnace Tour,14,Worcester,5
Arches National Park,"We visited in August expecting blistering heat and long lines, and we were pleasantly surprised! Although it was hot (90-100 degrees), we just drank plenty of water and used some sports cooling towels and sunscreen. There were no lines in any of the park. We hiked Delicate Arch which is about 2 miles and requires people to be in normal physical condition. The view was amazing and the hike was fun for all ages. Part of our group hiked the 8 mile trail at Devil's Garden. That was difficult, and they left very early to avoid finishing the end of the hike in the heat. The Windows area is also great for views and an easy hike. I recommend a cooler in your car with extra cold water since the only water (not very cold) filling stations are at the visitor's center and the Devil's Garden which are at opposite ends of the park. Also, go one night after dark to see the stars! They were so bright and luminous. We saw multiple shooting stars which was really fun. We were here for 2 days and could have used another half day.","August 12, 2019",Great hikes options for all ability levels,28,"Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania",5

The roads are very easy to navigate and you can easily see the whole park in half a day, unless you are into hiking the many trails available throughout the park. We purchased a Gypsy guide program for $5 online that used GPS on our cell phone to tell us many things about the park and what we were seeing as we drove through the park. Be aware that it can be very crowded, especially on weekends.

The climb up the hillside in your vehicle is a good indication of what lies ahead. A lot of very different rock formations. Just when you think you have seen all of it, you turn a corner or Crest a hill and there is another incredible sight. I have been to Bryce, Zion, Monument Valley and The Grand Canyon.

The park is huge, so even large numbers of visitors can file in and (safe for a few standard attractions) it won’t feel crowded. By all means, take the 2-3 hours out of your day that it takes to hike up to Delicate Arch (really hike there, don’t settle for the parking lot view 3 miles away). Always take sunscreen, dessert clothing (wide brimmed hat, loose but long-sleeved shirt and pants), firm boots, and plenty of water with you.

With that being said everyplace that we went to was great to see . The Delicate Arch was the most interesting and strenuous to hike to. The Windows was quite a bit easier to get to but still all the walkways are uneven and can cause a trip hazard. By noon it was very hot and we decided to just drive to all the arches we could see from the road.

We definitely would recommend the Double Windows & Turret hike, walk around Balanced Rock, and definitely check out the Sand Dunes Arch (my kid’s favorite). The Upper Viewpoint for Delicate Arch was beautiful, but a steep hike for my little one. Bring lots of water, as there are only two filling stations, and drink it.

You can drive the car inside the Park and the pull outs are made in all strategic places. Not all of the sights are visible from the road and you need to hike to some of them, so bring a bottle of water, sun screen and a hat. We made this trip in mid July, it was scorching.

As big as they are, the balance between time and gravity and erosion is fragile. There are many formations that can be viewed from the road, many more are a short hike from the parking lots and some are a long hike, up and down through ravines and over rocks to view nature's art.

Arches National Park,"Perhaps if you are a hiker, this would be amazing...but I am not. The formations are unique, they are amazing to see how they have been carved out of the stone, but for me, a $30 private vehicle entrance fee is a little steep, it is cheaper to get in most other National Parks...the line to get in was not very well managed, glad I saw it, but once was enough...","August 2, 2019","Neat, but repetitive",62,"Kingwood, Texas",3
Arches National Park,"Wow! We visited with 4 kids ages 10,7,5 & 3 while the dad's tended to some business in town. It was July and we started off at 7:30 - I wish it would have been 6am. However the hikes we chose with this pint sized crowd were not long at all. We stopped at balanced rock and then toured the double arch area. It was quite warm so we did a quick auto tour with the A/C on full blast through the rest of the park to make a plan for the next day. Just driving through this park quickly is so BEAUTIFUL! I highly recommend it even if you are just passing though. It might take longer when the weather is cooler - I can't even imagine how crowded this place must get with cool weather. (although it must not be as bad as Zion because there's no bus system etc... Zion is a joke btw, don't go there unless you have a back country permit and a local guide) We returned EARLY (6:30) two days later and all hiked to delicate Arch! WOW! All the kids did great. The littlest rode most of the way UP in a backpack and the 5 year old got a little tired but made it like a trooper. There is NO shade and it's uphill all the way up. The site is spectacular. We were down by 10am, where the park Rangers had set up a tent and warning people not to go up if they couldn't make it in the heat. Again I can't imagine how crowded this place would be on a cool day. Everyone was patient and accommodating for picture taking, and we think it was amazing. SO glad we saw it up close and personal.","August 2, 2019",New Favorite Park,34,"Saint George, Utah, United States",5

As the sun was getting hotter it was nice to be in the shadows of the canyon towers. I took some amazing photos there.

The visitor center is well prepared to give visitors every version for exploration that is possible. Some require 4 wheel off road drive. Some don't. Some require hikes for the initiated, some don't. Whatever you choose...the two hour driving loop or the however long you want to spend walking hiking t rails, you will not be disappointed. A camera dream. A wonderful National treasure.

Bring lots of water, and wear proper hiking shoes and a broad rimmed hat.Signage on the “primitive trail” in Devil’s Garden is minimal, so pay attention to those cairns (small rock piles). It would be very easy to get lost if you were out early in the morning before the crowds, as we were.The Delicate Arch hike is challenging mostly because it is uphill with zero shade. Devil’s Garden is partly shaded but technically challenging so you really need to be fit and have excellent mobility to do the full 12+ kilometres.Don’t miss Partition Arch.

Other reviews said to arrive either early or late in the day to avoid the traffic, but we encountered heavy traffic in only one area of the park.Be sure to bring your camera, as there is much more to photo than natural rock arches!!

I had an opportunity to do the Fiery Furnace guided hike, without the kids, and highly recommend it. If you’re in decent shape it isn’t really that hard, and it was fun to climb through the canyon. As a family, we also enjoyed the Delicate Arch hike (3 year old was able to do with help) and the balanced rock hike (super easy and stroller friendly).

The heat during the summer here is intense and the area is very dry. We actually witnessed a young woman who collapsed near the North Window.

We could actually see this area waaaaay off in the distance from our camp spot. 2 - Delicate Arch. This is the famous one you always see in pictures. You just need to hike to it. Do it! 3 - Definitely walk the Devils Garden Trail at least to Navajo, Partition, and Landscape Arches. It's a nice family hike that everyone will survive. 4 - Our favorite picnic area is the first picnic spot by Devils Garden Campground. Warning, if you have young kids, or bored teenagers, you might want to be selective with which arches you see. After a while they all start looking the same and no one cares anymore.

Sure enough we spent the day (until about 14:00 when we left) fighting off the selfie zombies.It is spectacular, and it is worth seeing, but don't expect serenity. You need to plan your visit quite well to have the best chance of enjoying your day. Some parts can get really busy and parking is an issue. That being said, I was rather disappointed that the rules of having to park only in designated spaces to limit numbers on trails were not enforced. We spent 30 minutes waiting for a space at the Devils Garden trailhead (we went to the Windows first, otherwise we'd have encountered this problem there). However, when we returned from our hike, 150-200 cars were parked illegally. If you're going to have a rule, enforce it. Otherwise those playing by the rules waste time and lose out to those that don't.We weren't even here in peak season....must be busy beyond imagination sometimes.","July 24, 2019","Spectacular, but crowded",292,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",4

Some of the Arches require some hiking to get to, but they are easy hikes and mostly accessible. It is so worth it. Drink twice the water you think you need in all of the parks.

The view at the top is well worth the hike up the hot rocks and gives you a whole different perspective of the park.

Arches National Park,"Absolutely fantastic park, graced not just with the array of arches, but many other beautiful views of natural phenomena in this desert landscape. I particularly like the fact everything is hidden by an escarpment, so there is a slow reveal of the natural wonders. A few obvious tips if you visit in July, as we did. Firstly, go as early as you can. We were in around 7.30. From then on it gets very hot, very crowded and parking spaces fill up. Secondly, if you are there early, do walk some of the trails as you only appreciate the scale of some of the arches as you get closer. Thirdly, take enough water for your visit. There are long lines at the filtered water dispensers. Finally, if you want to see the Delicate Arch but not do the 3 mile trail, take binoculars or a telephoto lens. It is well in the distance from the short trails.Our two teens really enjoyed the park and thought it better than Monument Valley. We spent about 5 hours in the park and would have stayed longer if not for the intense heat and the fact there is no food for sale in the park.","July 16, 2019",Astonishing,211,"Krakow, Poland",5

Parking is plentiful and the roads are in good condition. Get a map when you enter and follow around to the different areas, all of which have names and are well marked with signage.Don't miss stopping here.

If you've never been to Utah in the middle of summer, it can be extremely HOT. And the heat is a dry heat, so you definitely feel it. The forecast for the day we were there was supposed to be above 95F, so we got up and left our campground by 6:30 a.m. While our kids grumbled about getting up so early, we were on the trail by 7:15 a.m. While all of the literature says that this is an ""easy"" hike, it has some challenging sections. It's definitely not completely flat, and you must traverse rock faces and do some up and down walking on dirt and sand. By leaving yourself a lot of time in the morning sun, you won't be completely exhausted by the time you reach the view, and it is worth the walk! Make sure to take lots of water. My family of five (two adults, three kids ages 7, 13, 16) were each able to carry their own small water bottle, which made the hike much easier.

Arches National Park,"Arches National Park is in eastern Utah, and has recently received Dark Skies Certification.The park is just 5 miles north of Moab, which makes it easy to visit as a family activity. More than 2,000 natural sandstone arches are located in the park, including the well-known Delicate Arch, which is the state symbol of Utah. No place else in the world has this many natural arches. Most are short hikes on marked trails. Parking at the viewpoints works well also if hiking doesn't work for you.The park ranges in elevation from 4,000 feet to over 5,600, but it is not cool. The summer season begins in April and goes until September, and temperatures can easily and frequently reach 100 degrees. There is little shade, and water is found only in designated areas. Sun protection and quantities of water are important. We found that a large umbrella for shade worked well.Arches receives an average of less than 10 inches of rain annually, so it is high desert. There is no food or lodging in the park. Devils Garden features 52 camping spaces, with flush toilets and water. These must be reserved many months in advance and from the website only. Devils Garden is open year round.The park is popular with individuals, groups, and tours so during busy times, it can have parking issues.

Arches National Park,"I arrived at the visitors center at 7am. The guard booth was unmanned and the center opens literally at 7:30. Get there early if you want to take the Fiery Furnace Tour. They show you a movie and you have to pay a $6 permit fee. I skipped that, paid the $30 for a seven day pass to the park and began my journey. You know you are in for fun when you are already on switch backs right out of the visitor center. I hiked the Park Avenue Trail as my first trek. It said it was only a mile, and that it was one way. Of course it was in the shade so I figured I didn't need water. STUPID. Between the altitude (around 7,000 ft above sea level) and the dryness you need water, even in the shade. I then proceeded to Balanced rock where I encountered my first tour bus chalk full of Japanese tourists. Check with the bus driver to see where they are heading next so you can go to a different location. Off to The Windows Arches. I found a great rock in the shade to rest against, eat lunch and enjoy the view at Double Windows arch. Parking can be tough here as the lot also serves Double Arches. Just keep circling around and you'll get a spot. Next stop was Delicate Arch. Take the 3 mile trail that you first encounter. I didn't and went to the observation lot further down. You need a telescope to see Delicate Arch from there. Even the 1 mile trail, which is very strenuous still requires binoculars to see Delicate Arch.

The tourist would spill out by the hordes onto the street walking wherever they wanted to trail or no trail I wish Arches personnel could put up more signs or actually watch certain areas. ,"June 24, 2019",Beautiful,14,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5
Arches National Park,"It was raining and threatening to storm during our visit, so I cannot speak about any of the trails because we were afraid to get caught out in the weather.

Arches National Park,"""The Arches"" has 'em: over 2000 arches, plus a huge array of curious statue-like formations that will remind you of looking up at clouds and guessing what they look like.There are no shuttles in the park and parking can be tricky, especially when tour buses park on the road, forcing traffic around them, but it's worth it. Here are my favorite places to visit:- Start with the Visitors' Center. There is a reason why there are so many arches and cleaved rocks and you have to view the presentation at the center to understand what's going on. - Park Avenue is just after a winding access road at the beginning of the park entrance. See it on the way in, because you'll miss it on the way out.- Courthouse Towers: appears on the left and looks just like city hall or a courthouse- Balanced Rock: appears on the right, just before the turn-off to the windows. If the parking lot is crowded, just drive slowly past... the rock is right on the road.- Windows: a number of holes through rock walls, one of which being maybe 75 feet in diameter. You can walk under the arch while someone takes your picture from 300 feet away or so. Really cool.- Delicate Arch: I was looking forward to this, but it was the most disappointing and far away unless you make a special effort to hike up to it.- Sand dune Arch: By far, my favorite. you park in a lot and take a .2 mile walk around the corner into an oasis in a canyon. To the right is the arch, with rock passageways to the left, right and beyond. So very cool.","June 24, 2019",My favorite Utah attraction,105,"Canaan, New Hampshire",5

Arches National Park,Our family spent one day hiking in Arches. It was an exhausting but worthwhile visit. The sights here cannot be duplicated. Spend as much time as you can seeing as many sights as you can. Delicate Arch is the best of all but does take some work to see up close. Nearly an hour to get there mostly uphill but the sight is the reward. Window Arch in the morning is relatively easy and nearly as impressive. Go if you can.

Arches National Park,"Arches is our favorite National Park. You can see incredible sights from the car, after a short, simple walk, or after a difficult, but rewarding, hike. Be sure you plan in advance what you want to do because the day(s) pass swiftly. Driving in from the park entrance takes you by a host of incredible features. There are many easy pull offs, and usually plenty of room. Balancing Rock is the first ""hike,"" and it is very easy and worth the few steps. Landscape Arch is an amazing feature. It is the longest Arch in the park, and an easy hike over almost level ground. It's days are numbered because it is getting so thin, and you can no longer go under it. The centerpiece of Arches is Delicate Arch. It is a very strenuous one mile hike going up 500 feet. Go early, and bring lots of water. The view is worth the hike. Be sure you take it all in. The last time we went many were taking quick selfies and leaving! You took the time to do the hike - enjoy! There are many other things to see and do in Arches. This is what we have done. Please plan in advance. During our hotel stay we encountered many people who were heading to Arches and didn't know what they were going to do. They will be sorry.

Arches National Park,"There are so many reasons to recommend this park, that is once you get through the entrance. Best to be there before 8:30 in the morning as the cars in summer backlog into the hundreds after that (or go during the heat of the afternoon when people find it just too hot and you can nab a parking spot at the attractions). Your first views will prove dazzling as you ascend the road that makes you feel smaller and smaller against the towering cliffs beside you. But it is upon actually entering the park that you'll be stunned, something I wrote a bit more extensively in a link in Trip Advisor's TRAVEL FORUM but truthfully, photos simply don't do the park justice, much as seeing pictures of the Grand Canyon or the Eiffel Tower. You stand there and try your best to capture the frozen salt domes and rock beds, each over a mile thick! But good luck because this is rather humbling, geology in motion as 160 ton rocks collapse (this happened in 1991 at Landscape Arch) and yet you can still walk under many of the 1900+ arches, some just forming and some appearing about to give way. Many, such as The Windows, are just a short walk (1/4 mile) while others such as Delicate Arch take a bit more of a test of your hiking ability. The crowds are large in summer, which is a good thing and should be a clue that this is indeed a park worth seeing. And sorry but these reviews have a limit of 1500 words and so info is limited...go the TRAVEL FORUM for more details.","June 22, 2019","If you haven't gone, GO!",27,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

Arches National Park,"I know it's heresy but I found Arches overall to be monotonous compared to the scenery of Zion or even other Utah state parks (once you've seen 3 or 4 arches, you've kind of seen them all). Arches was also very crowded, and the first day we drove into Moab (late May) it closed because it was at capacity. You have to get here early or you are out of luck. What made our visit and impressed upon us the beauty of this place was the ranger guided Fiery Furnace hike. We made reservations in November for a hike in May. The Fiery Furnace requires a permit or a ranger-led reservation because there are no marked trails. We checked in at the Visitors Center at 7:30 a.m. and traffic into the park was already starting to build. The drive to the trailhead was another 30 min. or so. Arches is a huge park. We got to the Fiery Furnace trailhead and met with the other 18 people on the hike. They cap the hike at 20 pretty ruthlessly. We hiked with a young woman whose husband was on the later hike; they would not bend the numbers even for family groups. You really need to wear good hiking shoes/boots for this. Regular sneakers will not cut it. You have to be able and willing to jump across crevices, do some stemming, and jump up some big rocks. You don't have to be a top-tier athlete, but you do have to have some basic level of physical fitness to get through the Fiery Furnace. Our group was supportive and helpful; we were among the older (mid 50s) but not the oldest. It was a rewarding and gratifying experience. I learned a lot about the protection of this delicate desert environment that I took with me on other hikes (i.e. do not disturb crusts, do not step in puddles). The Fiery Furnace itself was cool; the name refers to the red color of the rocks, not the temperature. There was a lot of shade. There are some wonderful views (Skull Arch, Surprise Arch), and you get some education on the ecosystem. We went on a 2.5 hour hike starting at 9. When we returned, cars were cruising the lot looking for space. It's a permit-only hike and the ranger checked people to see if they had the permits. Some did not and the ranger turned them away. At one point a helicopter hovered over our hike. The ranger radioed it in to report/arrest them. If you do not have a permit do not try to come here. You will have an unpleasant confrontation.","June 19, 2019",Fiery Furnace ranger-guided hike made it for us,65,"Middletown, New Jersey, USA",5

However, we did get out of the car and one of my favorite stops was one of the shortest hikes to Sand Dune Arch. If you have a young child, this is the place to visit! It's a short, extremely easy hike, but the benefit is that the Sand Dune Arch requires you to walk through a narrow passage (just a few feet long, but shaded and oh so cool compared to the hot sun) and then provides a contained area for youth to explore and adults to appreciate the beauty.

There are temporary parking/stopping spots/areas all along the road to stop and take pictures or simply enjoy the landscape. I prefer those more than the actual stops, as it gives a landscape/panoramic view of the area including the arches and there are too many people at the official parking zones. Most of the arches are along trails from where the parking zones are, though some of them do have a viewing spot, where you can see the arch from a distance. Its mostly sunny, so have a cap/hat and carry water, and of course your camera. The sky is so clear on most days that the photos come very bright and clear. The important arches that I went to are the Delicate arch, the Landscape arch, the Skyline arch, the Sandstone arch. There are a lot more. And everything that you look at seems so grand and beautiful. Its also good to do some basic geology, looking at sedimentary structures (amazing cross beddings) and erosional structures.","June 11, 2019",Mother of all arches,14,"Tuscaloosa, Alabama",5

Arches National Park,"This Park is absolutely stunning! It is so cool what mother nature can offer.Go early! The park gets super crowded but being there before 7 was the best choice I made. Beautiful hikes with less people on trails, easy to stop at view sports or find parking. Managed to do 3 hikes: The Delicate Arch, Balanced Rock and the Primitive Way at Devils Garden. Delicate Arch is a medium hike for anyone. It gets a little scary for people with fear of hight as the tops gets slightly narrow. But it is so worth it and if you keep right on the inside and focus on your steps you will be fine. Balanced Rock is easy. A pretty cute hike for beginners, kids and elderly. And fun for everybody else.In Devils Garden, I wouldn't recommend the Primitive trail for unexperienced hikers. Even part of the mail trail become very difficult after the Landscape Arch. If you are not used to hike, afraid of heights or don't have proper hiking shoes, don't go! Also, I wouldn't recommend to do it with smaller children or even carrying them on the back in a seat. There are narrow ledges, slick rocks you have to jump/slide. For anyone experienced: go for it, it is super fun!

The pathway is not suitable for those with walking issues, especially in the last half. The path is dirt with ""native stepstones"" which make for an uneven walking area. I use a cane and made it, but you need to be careful. In my opinion, Balancing Rock would be a great photo op with the sunset behind it.

We had a 3 year-old and 7 month-old with us.Arrive early to avoid the heat of the day and some of the congestion. No one wants to wait in line to enter a park. We got there around 8:00 AM mid-week the week of Memorial Day and had no problem, but there was a wait of 10-12 cars per line as we exited in the afternoon.We did several hikes: Delicate Arch View (not the actual hike to Delicate Arch), Landscape Arch, Pine Tree and Tanner Arches, Double Arch, Turret Arch, and North and South Windows. All were easy for us (mid-30s, pretty active, each carrying a kid). We wish we had hiked to Delicate Arch looking back, but it was our first day hiking with kids and didn’t yet have the confidence we acquired as the trip continued and we tried more hikes.It definitely got busier as the day went on, but we expected that. After visiting all parks in The Mighty Five, this one was moderately busy. It also wasn’t overly commercialized.

Everyone I encountered were nice and friendly in one area a Jeep guide was kind enough to ask if I had enough water.

Again, make sure to climb through the smaller arch to the other side and then climb up the incline to a flat spot looking down and back through the arches.

Arches National Park,"It is really difficult to put how stunning this park is in words. The sights are unreal. What makes Arches National Park so unreal? It is all the rocks. Arches is a landscape of different colors, land forms and textures unlike any other in the world. Arches National Park has over 2,000 natural stone arches, hundreds of soaring pinnacles, massive fins and a giant balanced rock. It is a red-rock wonderland!The park is in eastern Utah near Moab. It consists of 76,679 acres in the high desert on the Colorado Plateau. The highest elevation is 5,653 ft and the lowest is 4,085. It was first named as a national monument in 1921 and was redesignated as a national park in 1971. The park is very popular had had over 1.6 million visitors in 2018!Arches National Park has a lot of famous arches like the Delicate Arch, Windows, and Turret. The Balanced Rock is also well known, and it is a rock that they think weighs about 3,577 tons. I hope you have a chance to visit several of the 5 National Parks in Utah.

Crowding isn't too bad at that time of day (in early May), and the light is interesting on the landscape. Later in the day, the crowding gets to be a bit much. I can't even imagine this place in the height of the summer travel season. On one day, I walked the Double-0 arch/Navajo Arch/Landscape Arch loop and connecting Devil's Garden primitive trail. When I completed the loop, the main trail and the parking lot were VERY crowded (this was about midday). I think big part of the crowding has to do with the relatively small size of the park and its proximity to Moab.

Delicate arch is a gem, I'm scared of heights, the only issues I had were at the very end. Also hiked a fair portion of Devil's garden and saw the landscape arch which was also quite beautiful. We really enjoyed the windows section because there are many arches concentrated in a small area. We ended the day with a hike down Park Avenue, to me this was more strenuous than Delicate arch hike and looked very different than the rest of the park b/c there are no arches. Nonetheless, I really like the park avenue hike and couldn't believe many simply pass it by on the way in and don't allow themselves at least an hour to hike partially into that canyon and see the view. This was the first park on our Utah/Arizona national parks tour and it blew me away, it is nothing like the other parks in Utah or Arizona.

Arches National Park,"Along with Bryce Canyon National Park, Arches National Park is now tied for my favorite place to visit on Planet Earth. The scenery is stunning throughout the park. Visitors can take a drive of approximately 25 miles, with numerous pull-off spots and vista points along the way, as well as take various walks and hikes of differing degrees of difficulty. Breathtaking doesn't begin to express the views in this wondrous place.Helpful hint to travelers to Arches: Get there early, because the park gets crowded and parking can be challenging (being kind about it) throughout the park after about 10:00 or 11:00 a.m. Helpful hint #2: The weather there is such that the tendency is for the park to get cloudier and cloudier as the day progresses, so your best views will be earlier in the day and your best odds of hitting a rain shower are in the later afternoon.Helpful hint #3: If you're physically able to do it, make a point of taking advantage of the walks/hikes/trails that the park offers. Some of them let you get right up to the arch structures themselves, actually climbing into them. Those views are unbeaten, anywhere.Helpful hint #4: Bring water and snacks with you BEFORE you enter the park. There is water available at the visitor's center, near the entrance to Arches, but nowhere else in the park; and there are no further services available anywhere in the park once you drive past the visitor's center.","May 20, 2019","spectacular, unusual beauty at every turn",77,"Silver Spring, Maryland",5

Arches National Park,"I had high hopes for our visit to Arches and I must admit I was somewhat disappointed. I know this is a popular park and therefore it can get crowded. It took us a good 20 plus minutes to get into the park. The sights are magnificent and beyond belief. That being said, what you need is a lot of patience at the popular spots. Parking is a problem particularly at the arches view points. I would suggest you go to the park as early and possible and go directly to the arches viewing spots and do them first and then work your way back. This might be away to avoid the crowds. I think banning motor homes would also help. A shuttle system like the one Bryce and Zion have might help although I realize Arches is spread out over a much wider area.

Arches National Park,"This was the first stop on our Spring Break tour of Utah and it should have been our last because this park was the most friendly for kids to hike and climb and parents not to need a drink because of kids falling off cliffs. We got there early, most travelers probably try to get there at sunrise but my crew takes longer at breakfast and getting ready so we showed up around 7 am. There wasn't any line to get in and the ticket stand wasn't open yet, so we just drove thru and paid later. On our way out though we saw the line of cars to get in. I would recommend going early so that way at the main stops you have plenty of parking to choose from. There were a couple spots later in the day that cars had to drive around to find a spot or wait for people to leave. There is so much to explore in Arches and the kids loved climbing the rocks. The views were incredible you could see the desert and the snow on the mountains in the background. I would pack a picnic lunch and there isn't a bad spot to eat, because the whole place is beautiful. We were there for two days and we could have hiked for two more. I wasn't blown away by the main arches you see in most photographs, I think there is plenty else to be blown away by. I wish we had gone back at night to see the stars away from the light pollution, but the kids were tired. The park is open 24 hrs. but it might get a little crazy driving in the dark.

Arches National Park,"You should plan to spend at least one full day here, but you may be better off breaking it into pieces and doing two half days, especially since there is nowhere to eat in the park, it gets hot by midday, and it's so much less crowded earlier and later in the days. I spent two afternoons here - arriving between 2-4pm and staying until (or after) sunset, and that was perfect. I didn't get to see/do EVERYthing, but I hiked 80% of the marked trails and saw most things on my list. Some of the arches are much easier to see than others, and the trails vary from deep sand (that gets all up in your tennis shoes, unless you're wearing water proof hiking boots) to slickrock to gravel formed into walking paths. The only hike I'm sorry I did is the hard one up to Delicate Arch. It was no joke, and I had aimed to arrive at sunset, not calculating that the sun might go behind clouds before sunset itself. (Duh. But super frustrating.) If you do that hike, leave more time than you expect to need, so you can take is easy on the way up. (It's hard uphill the whole way there, and downhill the whole way back.) Just the drive through Arches is really impressive, on its own. Just don't cheat yourself by not allowing enough time for yourselves in the park to see what you have the energy to see! This park is like nothing else!","May 10, 2019",Bucket list,336,"New York City, New York",5

Arches National Park,"Unbelievable rock formations. Some hiking if you really want to get close and personal but you don't really have to, just enjoy the scenery. One clue, Delicate Arch is nice to get up close and personal but it's a bit of a hike. The ""view"" only of it is also a hike I don't recommend, take the picture from the lower lot and deal with it. Otherwise take the one mile in hike up the hill. Same is true for Broken Arch but others are accessible. Do the visitors center so you know what you are seeing. Vistas change by the hour depending on sun, clouds, time of day, etc. but anytime is worth it. Better than Zion and if you can't get to Bryce, this suits almost as well.","May 9, 2019",One of the best next to Grand Canyon,14,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",5
Arches National Park,"Arches National Park was stunning! We drove through it and took a few short walks, so I can say it is do-able without needing to do hikes. Having said that, there are heaps of hikes that can be done there. We climbed up into the ""eye"" of one of the arches (I forget if it was the North or South one), which was challenging for me (I am not good with heights) but still lots of fun. Tips - get there early. In spring it was not too busy, but we still had to wait in line to drive in. The visitor centre closes early and there is no food to buy there. Bring your own food, and take plenty of water. ","May 9, 2019",Stunning Arches,6,"Melbourne, Australia",5

Arches National Park,"We went in the afternoon around 3 and had no wait at all getting in. The next morning when we drove by there was a long line of cars waiting, so perhaps the morning isn't the best time to go. We enjoyed the visitors center and watched the movie there before heading out. In our younger years we hiked right up the delicate arch, but this time we opted to go to the area when you could view the arch with just a very short walk from the parking area. We DID hike to one of the arches because it was supposed to be a relatively flat walk. ""Relatively"" is misleading - there were a lot of ups and downs on the way. I can't remember the name of the arch but it's the really long, low, narrow one. The walk seemed longer that the mileage posted, but we visited with some of the other hikers on our way, one was from Germany, and it made trip more enjoyable. It's a beautiful place.

There are several destinations you can get out and walk, although some areas don’t allow pets (dogs); yes you can leave them in the car but not for long as the temperatures can climb quickly.

Beauty everywhere so we kept stopping (in appropriate places) to take pictures. We went to the Windows Section 1st and did the Park Avenue section last. I think we had a total of roughly 6 hours in the park. Still did not see nearly enough of it. We like to meander along, soak up the beauty, take pictures and just enjoy nature.

The primitive trail does have a scramble that is a challenge and could probably use a cable for safety.The next day we hiked to Delicate Arch and were early enough that we got pictures of just us with the arch.There were some other shorter hikes we did as well.It was a great place to get some awesome views!","May 8, 2019",Worth the effort,19,"Lincoln, Nebraska",5

The park is clean, organized, and has paved roads providing access to many of the main arches (or at least access to the trailheads). Well worth the $30 admission fee! I've heard the park gets packed during the summer. I can't speak to that. I went on Easter Sunday which seemed to be a slow time.There is a nice mix of easy, moderate, and somewhat difficult hikes. The good thing is that you'll be able to see arches on almost every hike. Due to our schedule, we were only able to spend 1 day in the park. We did a mix of easy and moderate hikes over the course of about 8 hours.The highlight was the 3 mile moderate hike to see Fragile Arch (the most well known arch you see a lot in pictures). It is much bigger than I thought and just a great sight to see that kind of pops up out of nowhere once you turn a corner on the hike.Definitely worth a visit!

The weather was cloudy much of the time I was there. This was good for hiking because it kept down the heat, but it took away some of the beauty of the rocks. Still I was blessed with some sun and one spectacular sunrise. Arches is a very popular park. Everything I read said either go early, before 7:30 or go late, after 4:00. Shortly after sunrise and before sunset on clear days are supposed to be the best times to see the rocks, so that fits. Unfortunately, the first day I visited was during the middle of the day. It was just the way my schedule worked out. It took a bit over an hour to get through the line at the entrance. On one morning I went very early, missed the crowds and was actually out of the park by 8:30. The line was not very long at that hour, but this was, after all, April.

Arches National Park,"We - my husband, 9yr old & 12yr old & I - went the last weekend of April. We arrived at the park entry at 8 am Sunday morning and there was a very small line, maybe 3 or 4 cars in front of us. I had purchased an entry pass online beforehand, since I had heard a lot of comments about the line to get in being a mile long. It saved us a few minutes but even with the prepaid pass you still would have had to wait in the line as there was no express lane for prepaid entry. The park is stunning of course. Not as busy as we expected. Trails had people but not packed. Delicate Arch parking lot was half empty at 8:30 and almost full when we left at 10:30. Some other lots were full but the turn over is high so we were always able to find someone leaving. We are all pretty wimpy in the hiking department and did just fine with the trails we took. Weather cycled every few minutes from sunny to cloudy to a few drops of rain. Very little shade on any of the trails we took so I imagine in summer it is brutal. Bathrooms have no water but they were all pretty clean. I decided we'd start with Delicate Arch. It took us about 1 hour to get to the arch and maybe 35-40 mins down. You go thru a variety of terrain, including paved trails, sandy trails, rocky parks, the face of hillside that is smooth rock - the smooth rock portion intimidated my 9yr old but it looks worse than it is. The ledge at the end is quite nerve wracking if you have any issues with heights. I clung to the side like no ones business but most people didn't seem to have any issue. After that we drove to the end of the road, stopping at scenic points along the way. Skyline Arch is a great stop if you don't want to walk too far to see a great arch.We also did Windows Loop, which is a bargain - 3 arches in a mile loop and right across from Double Arch, all visible from the parking lot if you don't want to walk. We left about 2:30 to go to town for lunch. I would have gone back for sunset but it turned rainy in the evening.","May 1, 2019",Gorgeous,21,,5

There is no place in the park to get much, some drinking fountains at landscape arch trailhead. We also came back at 9pm to see the dark sky- AMAZING! Cant recommend it enough.

Arches National Park,"I have been here in November and July so can say what it is like for both those times of year. Obviously the summer is extremely hot and weather can be intense with the heat especially if you are traveling with kids. Also to be aware that it is so busy and the crowds can be a little too much in the heat when you're trying to find parking. Highly recommend it though, you will not be disappointed with the amazing sights and scenery everywhere. You will make great memories with your kids or if you are just a couple or group of friends. Great to get the annual park pass and go as many times as you want. Def get there early if you can in the summer when it's not as hot or busy and def recommend going up in the evening as well for sunset. November time was a stunning time to visit, the weather was perfect. A little chilly but perfect blue skies and it was so quiet, it felt at times you had the place to yourself which was a great contrast to the summer time. The only downside to going in November is a lot of shops in Moab are closed but you will still find a few where you can get some stuff.","April 29, 2019",Fab park highly recommend it.,4,"Cork, Ireland",5
Arches National Park,"My family was absolutely in love with the place. I then told them we would be going on a ""little"" hike. They aren't what I would call hikers but after a little convincing they gave it a go. There was some hesitation especially looking up the rock face and seeing all the little dots (people) climbing up to get over the top to see Delicate Arch. After about 50 minutes we made it to the arch and they loved it and were very proud of themselves for doing it. My kids 9 & 11 impressed themselves after making it to the arch and they asked to go on another hike now that they saw what they could do. In all it took 2 hours to hike up and back. Go early or later in the day when the heat is not as much, bring plenty of water, and take your time. Don't forget the camera you are going to want a picture of yourself under the arch.","April 28, 2019",Made it to Delicate Arch.,6,,5

Lots of great major highlights seen directly from the viewpoints or with short easy walks/hikes. Great rocks for the kids (and adults) to climb. Amazing how you see different rock formations that look like people, animals, anything you can imagine if you look at some of their shapes. We spent the first day doing the viewpoints up to Balance Rock with a few easy walks. We spent a second day starting with the hike at Delicate Arch and then the hike at Landscape Arch (see separate reviews).

If you are able to do some short walks, not even a hike, the trails to several places are cleared and well kept. Bring plenty of water and sunscreen to make sure you take care of yourself. The trail to Delicate Arch is not an easy one. Nothing terribly difficult other then the length and elevation gain, so if you are willing to take lots of breaks and rest, you can do it. There are a few spots of narrow trail, and if you want to go up to the arch at the end you will need to climb over some rocks, but you can still see it without climbing over.

Arches National Park,We went here with 2 adults and 2 children (11 and 9). Our kids asked to do the Junior Ranger program at the visitor center. They got their booklets and it encouraged them to learn and actively engage with the park. The cool thing about this park is you can drive through and still get to see many of the arches if someone can’t do walking. If you can do some walking you can get up close to multiple arches and go inside the arch. Several of them have nice paths to them. If walking and hiking aren’t an issue you can see some spectacular sites. If you are doing the more aggressive hikes you will need at least 2L of water per person.

Arches National Park,"This was a highlight of our trip: a must-do when visiting Arches. You need a permit to do this area of the park; permits can only be acquired in person within 7 days of the date you’ll visit. It takes 20 minutes (not including wait time) to get the permit as you need to watch a video. Absolutely worth it!Fiery Furnace is an area with rocks, slots, climbs, descents, “cave-like” spots, views, picturesque viewpoints, peace and quiet, steep climbs, narrow areas to walk though, etc I could go on and on. It’s unique and interesting and fun. There is no map to follow the trail; this makes it challenging and interesting. There are small arrows which are hard to notice (intentional in order to preserve the natural landscape). This adds to the experience as it feels rewarding when you spot one! At times you’ll walk the wrong way due to missing an arrow, and will turn back at a dead end. Along the way we met others and shared the experience for a while, enjoying this challenging experience.

Arches National Park,"We visited Arches the day after we went to Canyonlands Island in the Sky. The park is smaller and we found it easier to see in a day. Like Canyonlands, we used the GyPSy App for the iPhone. It only cost $8 for both parks and gave us a guided tour of the park on the iPhone, played through the car radio, and didn't require a cell connection. The map on the phone helped too. I downloaded the app in my hotel the night before. We entered the park at 8:00 am to beat the crowds at the gate. We saw the line the day before at 9:00 and knew we wanted to avoid that. We found parking at turnouts and parking lots to be no problem except at the Devil's Garden Trailhead/campground/picnic area. We had to drive around the loop for 10-15 minutes until a spot opened. It was lunchtime. By 2:00, the lot had opened up.

I combined visiting Arches, with Canyonlands and Dead Horse State Park, switching back and forth between them to see sunrise and sunset in various different locations. The sunset hike to Delicate Arch was interesting because when we started the weather was really hot. But as the sun gradually went down it got colder and colder. We had planned for that, and we each had backpacks carrying additional layers of clothes: a 2nd layer of pants, a fleece jacket, a wind jacket, a wool cap, and gloves. After the sunset we hiked down in twilight. There was enough light to hike, but we had a flashlight just in case. Note: it is really, annoying to watch all the narcissistic people queue up to have their photo taken in the center below the arch. Finally, they were boo'ed off-stage when the special moment of sunset came... so everyone else could take a photo of just the arch with the snowcapped mountains in the background.

I know many people do the park for one day, but I suggested to plan two days if you don't want to miss any long trail that leads to great views. This way you can enjoy hikings without rush, taking time to take pictures and even include sunset / sunrise watching or star viewing at night. We did the double O Arch trail.

Arches National Park,"Visually, Arches National Park is stunning. It has an amazingly dramatic entrance drive: after winding your way up a huge craggy sandstone escarpment, you round huge rock bluffs to a vista of huge sandstone mesas, pillars and fins. And that's just the opening. It gets better from there.The trails are well designed to show off the best views of the park. They vary from easy, level walks through the desert to finish before soaring arches to very challenging scrambling up boulders and squeezing through narrow rock gaps and avoiding 75-foot falls when hiking The Fiery Furnace (which requires a permit).I visited primarily for the hiking and photographic opportunities, and it totally delivers on both. Best experienced over several days -- you can do 80% of the basic hikes out to the main views in a single day (I did), but the park has so much to see that coming back again and again is highly recommended.

We spent two in ‘69 and it was magical. As a child I scampered all over the rocks in utter amazement.

Even shorter walks take you close to Double Arch, North and South Windows, and Turret Arch. Of course, if you're up to a 3 mile hike, Delicate Arch is a must. However, I've said several times that if there were no arches at all, the spectacular scenery here would make it worthy of National Park status.

Arches National Park,"I truly have yet to visit a national park that I am disappointed with. Arches is incredible, a must see.We went to “the windows” for sunrise and although it turned out to be rather cloudy it was still amazing. The only negative was all the photographers there bickering!!! We just hiked away from them and sat ourselves on a rock to sit back and watch the sunrise. Going for sunrise is a GREAT idea because the crowds are light, parking is easy and there’s a sense of tranquillity. By going for sunrise we were able to do most things without dealing with crowds. We were happy to be heading out of the park when most people were heading in. The trail to the window arches is easy and short.The hike to the delicate arch is a little tricky (1.5miles there) and would not be easy for anyone with health issues or mobility difficulties. There is one point when you have to hike straight up a slab of rock. I saw a variety of people doing it, and it’s definitely doable! But it wouldn’t be considered easy. I wouldn’t recommend it in the heat of the day. The reward at the end is breathtaking though! It’s a very well trafficked trail so I would recommend doing this one early or late, not in-between. Don’t forget your water!The devils garden is another must see. Try and do the full loop. Check the weather as this place can get extremely windy. We were being pelted with sand and dust the whole time! The trails are easy and also well trafficked. This is also near a camping area that I think would be awesome to camp at!!Overall, if you’re in the area GO! And if you’re not in the area, plan a trip!!!

It was fortunate that we went early as by noon there was no parking available and those parking illegally were being ticketed. The trail took about four hours (~eight miles with the side trails). The arches were spectacular and well worth the effort. However, you must be physically fit and not afraid of heights. It also helps to pay attention to the trail markers as it is easy to get off trail in the rocky areas.The second day we entered the park early and visited the other stops and walked the shorter trails.Courthouse Towers View point was spectacular as was Park Avenue. You must visit Balanced Rock and the Windows Area. These tend to awe the visitor. If you want to visit Delicate Arch, Arrive early as parking fills up fast and the hike is long so turnover in the parking area is low. Best time to see the cvolors and take pictures is early morning and late afternoon.","April 10, 2019",Arches National Park,29,"Oceanside, California",5

The landscape never ceases to astonish and make you wonder at the forces that have shaped Earth through its life. You get a glimpse of the Arches while driving on the highway to Moab, but nothing compares with eye-to-eye contacts with the red sandstone formations and the amazement at walking under these gravity defying structures... well, gravity eventually always wins!We were traveling with my 8 and 5 years-old sons so we did not adventure in any of the more “challenging” hikes like the one to the Delicate Arch, but we raveled at the Windows, where my oldest really enjoyed climbing up to the Double Arches. Aside from the numerous stops along the scenic drive, we also did the longish hike to the Landscape Arch in the Devils Garden.

Delicate arch is a moderate hike of 3 miles round trip with a 500 foot elevation gain during the hike. It took my wife and I roughly 35 minutes to make it up there at a moderate pace. Do it early in the morning if possible to watch the sunrise and beat the crowds. By 9:00 in the morning the parking lot will be full and it gets crowded at the top. After this hike head over to landscape arch which is about 1.6 miles round trip and a lot easier. Definitely worth the time to make the hikes. ,"April 4, 2019",Some great hiking,26,Denver,5

The desert looks like a quilt, flowing in beautiful patterns and the colors of rust, tan, orange and shades of green. All of this makes for some very special photos. Some things to keep in mind: This park is laid out for auto touring. You must drive from viewing point/hiking spot to another. The park is very busy. Be prepared to wait at the gate. Finding parking can be difficult. Our best advice, go early in the morning. Drive to the back of the park and work your way forward. This ""may"" help you avoid the crowds.

Arches National Park,"As nature parks go, this one is first class. I researched Arches National Park only briefly. I would suggest anyone planning to visit to research A LOT MORE than I did. From beginning to end the loop is a 36-mile drive. Make sure you have the gas for it. Most of the sandstone formations are fully visible from the pull-off areas, but parking is a problem. We visited on an off-season Wednesday and still had to do a couple of drive-bys because there was no space for us. The guides rate the trails according to difficulty, but they can be misleading. The Delicate Arch is the famous one we wanted to see the most. I read that it was an easy trail to get to. No. You can easily view it from a distance, but to get up close as the photos suggest, you have to hike 3-miles uphill on an eroding trail with tricky footing. They suggest you pack at least a quart of water per person. It's intimidating as well it should be. I simply would have prepared better had the literature I read online not tried to sugarcoat the challenge. What we saw was gorgeous, awe-inspiring even, but this is not a casual excursion. Take a full day and get there early. We arrived at about 11:00 a.m. and had to wait a full 30 minutes to reach the gait. The good news is, a ticket is good for seven days!

It was a tough uphill hike up the hill and a little challenging at the top with a small walkway at the top. You can go with kids, just hold their hands at the top and be careful. the Arch is beautiful, but the hike with the family was just as good. When we reached the top, the wind was howling and we were getting pelted with sand in the wind. We took some pictures and got out of there. If we were without the kids, we would have stayed to take a picture under the arch, but it was still good.

Arches National Park,"We've enjoyed many of the nation's National Parks; while each one has something special to offer, we think Arches National Park rates as our favorite. Certainly, if you're anywhere close to the Moab, Utah, area, this is a ""must do"". There are plenty of natural stone arches to be seen, of course, but the beauty and vistas of the area and other rock formations are equally beautiful. You'll recognize that as soon as you start the drive into the park. Plan for 3-4 hours, giving you plenty of time to see many viewpoints and walk some of the shorter trails. If you're a serious hiker, you'll be here all day.Tip: Skyline Arch, close to the end of the road is beautiful. But rather than view it from the main road, continue past the arch and turn right into the Devil's Garden Campground, following the road to the Amphitheater. You'll have a much better view of Skyline Arch from behind the Amphitheater! (But avoid this if it's raining -- the ground will be very muddy.)Tip: With a 1/2 day in Arches, you'll have enough time to visit the northern portion of Canyonlands National Park (Island in the Sky area) in the afternoon, including the separate Dead Horse State Park (see separate review) if you're visiting in November-March. Other months see increased traffic and may require shortened visits if trying to do both in one day.Highly Recommended!!!!

Go into the park early to beat the crowds at the popular stops/hikes. There is limited parking so plan your trip well. Delicate arch is a must--there is a part that is difficult towards the beginning but don't let that stop you from finishing. Our other favorite was the Park Avenue Trail. Here you walk down in a wash and the formations around you are magnificent! And we were frequently the only people around so it was awesome to hear the dead silence of the area.

Arches National Park,Quick Rundown:Best family camping trip ever! We have 2 boys ages 12 and 9.Where to Camp: We camped at Devils Garden for 4 nights. Site 9 was perfect. Its close to the bathroom. The campground is a great launching point for hiking and driving to sites in the park. There are fun rocks to climb on for kids in-camp. Perfect star gazing at night around camp fire. Ed Waderman was the campground volunteer. Ed was very helpful and full of great information. CLEANEST CAMPGROUND. No showers but the bathrooms were very clean.**Don’t hike or ride bikes on the sand around camp. It’s Bio sand and can be destroyed***20 minute drive from the park entrance but we loved it every time we went to Moab*Favorite Hike: Devils Garden to primitive loop (8 miles)See the best collection of iconic arches on one trail. BEWARE: the primitive trail here has a slippery scrambling section that had many college guys on their hands and knees. Don’t recommend the primitive loop with kids.Favorite Short Hike and Site:The Windows. Easy .5 mile round trip. Cathedral arches and fun scrambles. Kids loved it. Missed Opportunity:Fiery Furnace - have to schedule the hike at the Visitors center. RESERVE AT LEAST 2 WEEKS OUT from your arrival. They only allow 75 hikers in per day. ,"March 17, 2019",Can it get any better than Arches National Park?,15,"Dallas, Texas",5

The advantage to Arches is that it has probably more interesting rock formations in a more condensed (but not dense) area. Advantage to Sedona is further south and closer to a major airport. Both great places. Highly recommend staying in the park until nightfall and stars come out. It is amazing.","March 7, 2019",Awesome!,27,,5

And it was the most wonderful of any of our previous visits.The two unique experiences that you won’t get at other times of the year are the peaceful tranquility and the unique vistas of snow covered mountains that make a startling contrast to the sandstone formations.On a two mile trail we encountered fewer than a dozen people. In the summer there is a constant stream of people and no silence to revel in.Around every curve in the road and bend in the path you’ll see something that will take your breath away.The Park doesn’t have lodging or eateries, but there are lots of picnic areas. There is a fabulous sandwich restaurant in Moab (Love Muffin Cafe; see separate review) where we bought sandwiches for our picnics.

Arches National Park,"I really know this Park, I have lived and guided in this park for years. Great place... can be too crowded and hot. First and foremost realize that all those people visiting Moab, are probably going to visit Arches... the lines to get in can be ridiculous after 8:00, the major sites in the park can be overrun by 9:00am... it’s too bad, but it’s like Yosemite. GET INTO THE PARK BY 7:00am, earlier in the summer... it will be cooler, and very peaceful... better photos too. Do the major hikes, like Delicate Arch trail early... it can be too hot just hours later. The same goes for the Primitive Loop Trail. Early is the key. the Park is open 24 hours. Note: The Fiery Furnace hike is probably the best, most impressive, hike, but limited to a small number of hikers per day... The Ranger led tours are great, but usually booked up for months... you can do it on your own, but navigating is challenging and you will likely miss some of the best places... I just found an online app that has great trail direction and seems reasonably priced compared to trying to struggle or pay for a Ranger led tour. If you’re staying a few days... on the first day go to the Visitor Center and see when and if you can get a permit. 1st thing! Second google Fiery Furnace and check out the guide... have fun, be safe, state early, lots of water... WATER, and sunscreen... have fun.","February 22, 2019",What can I say... you have to see this place,13,,5

We started at the visitors center and my kids did the junior ranger program (which I recommend). All of the rangers and staff were very kind and helpful, and great with my kids. We watched the movie in the center, then headed through the park. The roads were fine, but hiking trails were snowy/slushy/icy.

We arrived early enough that we were able to get into the gate quickly and first stop was the windows section. In my opinion, this was one of the heaviest areas for foot traffic, besides the devils garden trail. Parking gets tight at these places and the windows parking area is not as large as the devils garden. You Must go do the primitive trail behind windows.. there was only 4 other people there besides us.Bring a hat.. and LOTS of water.. no shade to be found anywhere.. and stay on established trails. It’s easy to go off as you’re staring up at the awesome beauty around you.It was hard to see as much as I wanted in one day, so we are returning for another visit for a couple of days and to stay overnight at devils garden campground.

Arches National Park,"Arches National Park was so much more beautiful and amazing than I had imagined. We arrived rather late in the day, and only had 3-4 hours to spend here. There was no line to wait in when we arrived; we went straight though. We had to rush around between the different stops, and although we got to see much of it, you could really spend a lot more time here rather than just a few hours. The Visitor Center was very nice with great information about how the arches formed. Since we didn't have a lot of time, we rushed through it, but you could easily spend an hour inside.The arches were interesting, but I was in awe of the area they call ""Park Avenue."" I felt like I was standing among ancient ruins in Egypt. Another area I recommend visiting is Sand Dune Arch. You walk a little bit through a lot of sand (like a beach, and you will get sand in your shoes) and you arrive in this little secluded hidey hole area with the arch. You have to experience it to understand how cool it is. One word of advice is to be careful, and don't climb around on the rocks if you are not prepared for the consequences. We saw a tourist that had to be rescued on a stretcher from one the trails because he fell and broke his leg. The park is safe if you are smart.I was considering other National Parks in this area, but I am so glad I decided on Arches. It is one of the top National Parks in the country.

The park staff does a great job of keeping it clean and running smoothly. We visited during the government shutdown before they closed the park and no entrance fees or gate control probably contributed to the high crowds.

Plan for a full day, at least. Have good walking shoes. I usually take walking sticks and didn't need them for any of the hikes. However, if you go in winter, it's a good idea to have Yak-tracks in case you encounter any icy spots on a trail. We went to Delicate Arch, Landscape Arch, Navajo Arch, Partition Arch, Broken Arch Sand Dune Arch; the Fiery Furnace... Gorgeous views as well as formations. Park Avenue also beautiful. In winter, have warm hat and gloves (the wind can be cold, even on a clear day), and a thermos of hot tea and/or water with you (normal for hike). You basically drive to each parking area, and then hit the trail to the arch, though the drives along the way bless you with beauty, and there are pull offs along the road for such moments.

This National Park has easy trails and treacherous trails not meant for the faint of heart. We did them both. We hiked over 12 miles the day we were here. We saw amazing landscapes and rock formations. This is now home to the two best hikes of our lives. The three mile hike to Delicate Arch up the side of a bare rock incline we thought was our top hike ever. But then it was quickly topped as we later that day hiked the primitive Double O Arch trail. Hiking on rock fins and up and down steep rock inclines was exhilarating and dangerous (especially in icy conditions). If hiking is not your thing, many of the arches are within easy walking distance of the parking. It also has great drives past some of these rock structures such as Balanced Rock and beautiful vistas. We spent the entire day here hiking, photographing and driving through this wonderland. This is a place we are glad we made the effort to get to and one we will remember all of our lives.","January 9, 2019",A Bucket List Experience!,456,Illinois,5

Arches National Park,"We spent 2 days in Arches and I am glad we did! One would not have been enough.On the first day, we drove from Moab straight to Devil's Garden Trailhead, which is a good 45 minute ride (it's all the way in the back of the park). We started on the 4.0 mile Devil's Garden Trail around 10 am, stopping at Tunnel Arch and Pine Tree Arch. Nice to see, but not spectacular by any means. We continued on to Landscape Arch. This is the largest arch in the park, I think. It was covered in fog, but it soon cleared up. We walked up closer to eat, sat down and had a snack enjoying the view.We then headed to Double O Arch, thinking I may not make it all the way, given what I had read about the trail. It was all true; the trail gets challenging and you have to traverse fins of rock, and we had to deal with ice in some spots, but with some help (some pulling and some pushing) I made it! We arrived at the Double O Arch around 1:30 pm, so it took us about 3 1/2 hrs. The Double O Arch is unique and I am glad the other reviews did not scare me into not including this trail in our itinerary.On the way back, we stopped at Navajo Arch - amazing! - and Partition Arch - also amazing!We took our time - I love to take many pictures, and the landscape in the Devil's Garden area was spectacular. The boys (22 and 18) also love to explore off the trail, sit down and enjoy the views, so it took us longer than it would take someone to just go straight to Double O and back. We were back at the parking lot at 4:30.So the trail took us about 6 hrs to complete, but that included a good 30 minute rest at each of the major Arches: Landscape Arch, Double O Arch, Navajo Arch and Partition Arch. We had a great time, and took some amazing photos.Don't be intimidated by the fins, they are not that narrow. And, as another fellow TripAdvisor member had advised me, keep going after Landscape. The first fin is right at the beginning, so if you feel you can't do it, you can return, but at least give it a try!On the second day, we headed to Park Avenue trailhead. This is only 15 minutes from Moab, it's at the front of the park. We arrived at 9:30 am and started down the trail. By 11:00 we were back at the trailhead. Again, we took our time and took lots of pictures.We then headed to Balanced Rock for a quick look, and continued to The Windows area. We did the short hike to the Double Arch first. Such a cool arch! I loved it. We then did the short hike to the North Window. Beautiful views and amazing photo ops. Then we headed to The Wolfe Ranch, for the hike to Delicate Arch. This was a rather challenging hike but the reward at the end is well worth it all. Amazing scenery!Highly recommend the Devil's Garden trail, the Park Avenue trail, the Double Arch and Windows area as well as the Delicate Arch.

There are many scenic viewpoints along the road to enable viewing and picture taking. At some points, there are trails that enable closer views of the rock formations.We spent about 90 minutes in the park and were able to see most of the sites, although a longer visit would have enabled further exploration.

It is recommended that one gets the yearly national park service membership - pays for itself if you go to canyonlands and go to one more national park. The $80 fee is pretty cheap and does the trick. The trails in canyonlands are slightly technical and not appropriate for kids.Also - don’t travel in a car. Consider a 4- wheel drive SUV OR rent a Jeep Wrangler. The place needs to be seen and driven around in a Jeep. Allow at least two to three days to cover Arches and Canyonlands.

Arches National Park,"It will all depend on how much time you allocate to your visit to evaluate what you will be able to see and it will depend on how much energy you have to expend. Our first visit to the park in 2014 we allocated a day and a half and it was just not enough time to do everything justice. Last time we completed the Fiery Furness walk with the Rangers and whilst it was enthralling and so informative it also ""knackered"" my wife so much that she spent the rest of the day looking at the exhibits from the car parks.This time we were far better prepared. From the entrance station it takes about 25 minutes to drive to the furthest point (Campground). There are two tarmac off-shoots from the main drag (Delicate Arch and The Windows) and both are definitely worth the excursion. There are also three rough track trails which encompass soft sand and wash crossings and these are only passable at certain times of the year or with four wheel drive vehicles.Whilst pretty and scenic drives there are lots more interesting natural beauty in the park to focus your time on.Here are a list of things we did and there timings and terrain.Park Avenue Viewpoint & Trailhead - easy walk couple of hundred feet to viewpoint. Trailhead drops about 60 feet and goes through middle of canyon (0.9 miles). Quite easy going.Courthouse Towers Viewpoint - short walk from car park and good scenery. Easy.Petrified Dunes Viewpoint - view from car park and in reality we carried on driving.Balanced Rock - 200 feet from car park. easy walk. Gets busy. Well worth the effort.Ham Rock/Cove Arch - in my opinion look at the from the road. Not worth a hike up.Double Arch. Half mile walk on fairly solid terrain until you get really close when it turns to soft sand and becomes more energy sapping (particularly on a warm day). However, you can climb up close and personal to this arch which with a blue sky in the background is spectacular. It is a bit of a climb up the rocks if you want to get underneath it about 40 feet up but manageable if you are agile. If you have the energy the Cove of Caves is another quarter of a mile further on but the terrain is not man-made and can be quite challenging. Very little shade around and so wear a hat.Double Arch is easier from the lower car park (which is one-way) but the Windows and Turret Arch are close to the top. There is quite an elevation change between the two car parks and so it is worth moving but they do get busy in high season and so circuits maybe needed before a space opens up. The walk to the windows is longer than Double Arch but the paths are well maintained and stepped where needed. Complete round trip to windows and turret is 1.2 miles and there is some climbing if you want to get up close to the actual arches but if your just after a picture then there are plenty of spots along the way. Fairly easy going but again no cover.Panorama Point has never really held our interest but you are passing anyway.Next offshoot is Delicate Arch and there are choices here. last time we did Lower DA Viewpoint and this was a easier trail of just over a mile on good quality paths but it brings you to the top of an outlook where you can see DA across the valley (no way to climb down and up again). Take a good zoom for you pictures otherwise maybe a little disappointed. Other option is to stop at the large car park at Wolfe Ranch. The Ranch itself is an interesting view of the hearty and determined people that tried to make Arches home. The pathway to Upper DA Viewpoint is 2 miles and whilst the first half mile is on level pathways the rest is far from it. You definitely need to be agile to muster this walkway as it climbs over outcrops and then hugs the side of the mountain on a track that makes passing your fellow travelers interesting. Don't get me wrong when you get there the view is beyond spectacular and well worth the effort. Be careful because even the 'flat' bits around the arch can have angles more than 45 degrees and a couple of times I felt I was going head over bottom and there are no barriers to stop you going over the edge if you do fall and roll. However, with care you can walk under the actual arch for that memorable photo. One way in and one way out pathway and so allow yourself enough time to enjoy. Took me two and a half hours to cover.Fiery Furnace - fabulous expedition but can only be completed as part of a Rangers conducted tour or with a permit (conditions apply) and has to be organised/paid before you arrive.Well worth it even though considered strenuous and challenging.Sand Dune Arch - perhaps one of the most beautiful parts of the park and only 0.2 miles from car park. Entrance is a little tricky for the infirm because it is the most beautiful golden sand you have ever seen and there is one element that is very thin and uneven to negotiate. Once in the open topped cavern it is sensational. Two rocks 'kiss' each other and no matter what angle you look at it, it is perfection.From the same pathway 1.2 miles away is Broken Arch and despite the approach being flat it is very hard work walking in soft golden sand. Trail undulates a little the closer you get and although you can see it in the distance it never seems to get closer until you turn a corner and there it is.Steep climb to get up and underneath it and then you get the sign for Tranquility Arch 0.8 miles further on but be warned, that's now two miles and then you will have two miles back. Makes the calves ache.Skyline Arch is a 0.3 walk from the pull-in and well worth it. read the information board for a history lesson. I guess if you are determined then you could scramble up to the actual arch but it is a good 100 feet up and a lot of energy would be expended in this. You can always drive around the back of Campground and walk through from this side. It is about 500 feet but again you can only get so close before a big canyon stops you.Devils Garden Trailhead - large car park and water refill station (that's gets quite a queue on).Tunnel Arch is 0.5 mile walk and just a bit further on is Pine Tree Arch. But the big one that eveybody wants is Landscape Arch. It's the picture on the front of the brochure and it is spectacular. Walk is 1.2 miles on fairly good pathways but does turn to sand after about half a mile. You cannot walk under this Arch as it is cordoned off but you get great views. Sun is always behind it in the afternoon so an early visit will give you a different perspective.As the crow flies Partition Arch and Navajo Arch are not far away but if you want to go see them then you will have to negotiate the Primitive Trail and this is probably the most difficult trail to follow. It goes up and down boulders you wouldn't think you could climb, across fin edges and you have to follow kernels of rock that point the way because the path is not always obvious. It is uphill and down dale and even though it is only 0.8 miles to the Double O Arch (different from Double Arch) it takes an eternity because the trail is so difficult.Let's take a step back and cover those arches we have passed. Navajo Arch is a 0.3 mile hike across one pathway from the main trail and is a nice arch you can walk under and see from both sides but whilst nice, it isn't the most spectacular. Partition Arch is again 0.3 miles from the main trail and is definitely worth a look. The view is amazing and it all just opens up in front of you. Be careful because it slopes away quite quickly and steeply as you walk underneath it but the scenery is brilliant.Double O Arch is as it says a double arch , one on top of the other and you can again scramble through to get pictures from both sides. A most difficult trail where halfway along I wondered why my in-built risk assessment monitor had ceased to work. I did the trip alone and looking back was not the most sensible thing I have ever done. One trip, one fall and I guess it would have been very serious. In the three and a half hours I spent on the trail I passed 6 people. So if you like solitude then this will certainly get you away from the crowds.

Arches National Park,First visit to Arches and we loved every minute of it. Not too many crowds and it felt at times that we had the arches to ourselves - got so many pictures with just us in them. We got the tickets online so we could save time at the gate. It's a very driveable park and most of the hikes to see the arches are fairly easy. The weather was beautiful on both days we went there. We need to come back again as we did not have time to see the entire park. ,"November 16, 2018","Beautiful, serene and awe inspiring",35,New Jersey,5
Arches National Park,Arches is magnificent...we drove to the end and worked our way back. The Landscape Arch is a nice walk a little undulating but EASY and about 2.6 KMs make sure you walk all the way there as the view is better from below. There is a walk to Navajo Arch further along but the track is steep and narrow along rock ridge so you need to be steady on your feet for that. However if you aren’t there are plenty of easy roadside options that provide magnificent viewpoints without hard walking. The Double arch is also worth the walk and and is easy and under 1km. Though you can see it from the road it really is best close up to see its magnificence. Sand Arch is tucked away behind some rocks and again a short walk though it has some sandy spots. It’s looks like lady and the tramp kissing. This in worth spending time here. It really is gorgeous a must see spot. ,"November 16, 2018",Arches in a day but could stay longer,45,"Melbourne, Australia",5

Arches National Park,"My sister and I just finished a 4-day stay in southeastern Utah. We are both seniors who love the outdoors. From friends' recommendations as well as our own research, we felt we would enjoy Arches N. P. immensely. It was even BETTER than we had anticipated! The incredible thing about the park is how spectacular yet how different the arches are from one another. We were overwhelmed by these arches, listed in no particular order: Double, Windows, Sand Dune, Delicate, Double O, Landscape, Broken, Skyline, Navajo, Partition, and Pine Tree. And we loved the Three Gossips rock formation, as well as the hike from the Courthouse Tower up Park Avenue and back (easier, we were told, than going in the other direction-- we agree). Visiting in early November turned out to be a big plus, since most reviews which find fault with ANP remark on how crowded and/or hot it can be. In November? No problem! It WAS a bit colder than we would have liked, but we had both come prepared with warm hats and gloves, as well as several layers for our torsos, plus water and snacks in the car. We're definitely considering coming back in the spring, when the crowds will still be relatively small, but there'll be more daylight.

We decided to go in early November to hopefully avoid the crowds, and we hardly saw anyone. We only went around sunrise and sunset because my husband does nature photography, and those times make for stunning photos. We also went one night two hours after sunset to view the Milky Way. It was the day before the new moon, and the view was incredible. We went to Panorama Point, which is flat and open, unlike many other parts of the park.Arches is absolutely one of the most amazing places I've ever seen, and I've done a lot of traveling.

Arches National Park,"The park is huge and overwhelming, but it’s wonderful! Use the Visitor Guide given at the park entrance. It has a wealth of information and will tell you how to plan your visit according to how much time you have to spend in the park. To see some of the arches in the park it’s a very easy hike, and some are very difficult. The Visitor Guide has them broken down into easy, moderate and difficult trial hikes. The Windows and Double Arch areas are spectacular and are easy hikes, but if you plan on standing under Delicate Arch you need to be in good shape. It’s a 3 mile round trip, rated difficult. If you aren’t ready for that hike you can still see Delicate Arch at a viewpoint and get a great photo. We like to visit Arches in October and November.

Spend a sunset at Balance Rock and watch the alpenglow on the snow-capped mountains behind. Or just wiggle your way into the ""fin"" rocks at Sand Dune arch and see if you can fine the ""Raven Kiss"" at the arch?

Arches National Park,"My husband and I visited Arches National Park for 2 days. We were able to hike and see almost everything we planned for. Most of the hiking we did was ""moderate"", but there were a few trails that are more taxing than others. We enjoyed them all with 1 exception: hiking to the Double Arch. Portions of this trail was dangerous -- going counter-clockwise, one area of the trail was going up on a narrow/steep area of slippery slick rock. Even with good hiking boots on, I could not plant my feet; my husband stopped me from sliding down/off at one point, and we reversed our hike and said ""not worth it""...greatly disappointed at not being able to finish. Thankfully, there were plenty of other trails we went on with success. The beauty of the arches and rocks are great. We recommend you get an early start to ""beat the crowds"" for heat-control, parking and walking on narrow areas of trails (where there is barely room for 2 people on the trail at one time).","November 6, 2018",A great place to appreciate the power of nature!,29,"Huntsville, Alabama",5

Even if you are not a hiker there is a road through the park with lots of overlooks. Take a drive and get out and marvel at the scenery. We spent one long afternoon. This was our 3rd visit over 15 years and we came at a cooler time so did a few easy hikes that we didn't do when it was 110. We did the loop trail around balanced rock. Worth doing. the Sand Dune Arch is a short walk but could be difficult because of the deep sand. It had rained before we did the walk so the sand was hard packed and not to hard to deal with. The beginning is rocky and the entrance is skinny. Right to the left is an easier way in to the small canyon which we found on the way out. We just looked at the delicate arch from the viewpoint.

This terrified me, a new experience for me as I didn't know I had a fear of heights til then. However it's a short distance and my partner was able to guide me around the corner to see the arch.

Arches National Park,"This has been on my bucket list for years and it did not disappoint. Every stop is breathtaking. The colors were spectacular. We went in October on a very busy weekend so planned to enter the park after 2pm. The entrance lines were much shorter and the parking lots and paths much less crowded. Each stop has information about what you are seeing and a well laid out path to follow to the arches or windows. The most crowded areas were The Windows and Delicate Arch. If you plan to hike to Delicate Arch come early or later in the day to avoid the crowds. We were only here for the afternoon(2pm -7pm) but felt we were able to see everything we wanted. Don't miss Delicate Arch (even if you don't do the 5 mile RT hike go to the viewing area and hike to the top to see if from across the canyon. You can get good photos from that vantage point as well. TheWindows Section is a great area to see lots of windows/arches and the Sand Dune Arch is a great place to cool off when it is warm. So much to see. If you plan to hike any of the longer trails would recommend spending a few days here. There is camping in Devil's Garden Campground. $30 entrance fee for cars unless you have a season pass.

Arches National Park,The Delicate Arch was a high hard climb for us lowcountry people but so worth it when we got to the top!!! The most beautiful of all the Arches I thought. The most fun we had was scaling the maze of the Fiery Furnace. It was like a giant playground for adults!! Do not do this if you are out of shape. You have to go through some very narrow crevices and be limber enough to pull yourself up rocks. Lots of poison ivy so keep your eyes peeled and slippery sandy rocks. I am in my sixties and I was glowing like a 13 year old when we made it through. PS keep your eyes peeled for the teeny tiny arrows. Sometimes hidden around corners. It’s the only way to find your way out!,"October 27, 2018",Delicate Arch and Fiery Furnace,23,,5

Both days we waited over 30 minutes to get into the park even though I bought the passes ahead of time. It would be nice if they had a line for passes and a different line. They also need more lanes and more parking at the different parking lots. after entering the park on Friday , it took 45 minutes to get a parking space waiting for someone to leave one.

We then went to to Devils Garden to see Landscape Arch, a longer walk, but still very easy. By the time we left this area, there was no parking left and many cars were circling the parking area. The highlight was Delicate Arch, probably the most beautiful arch. The hike is about two hours round trip and while not technically difficult, it is not easy.Take plenty of water and a packed lunch.

Since we did not want to spend 45 minutes at the gate, we made sure to arrive the next day by 7:30 a.m. and had no problem at all. Moreover, the early morning light was beautiful on the rock formations as we drove up into the park. We made sure to check out the Windows section first, because we knew it was a popular family attraction and would be full of people by late morning. We did three relatively short hikes at various places in the park and had a picnic at Devils Garden.

Arches National Park,"For whatever reason, convenience or access or climate, Arches National Park has become as popular as Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon in recent years with nearly 2 million visitors in 2018. Located four miles north of Moab, Utah, adjacent to the Colorado River, Arches covers 76,679 acres of high desert on the Colorado Plateau and features more than 2,000 natural sandstone arches in the park, the highest density of natural arches in the world, including well known Delicate Arch and Balanced Rock and Landscape Arch and Courthouse Towers. Arches was established as a National Monument in 1929 and designated a National Park in 1971. Historically, humans have occupied the area since the last ice age 10,000 years ago. Fremont people and ancient Pueblo people lived in the area until 700 years ago. Spanish missionaries encountered Ute and Paiute tribes in 1775 but the Mormons were the first European-Americans to attempt settlement in 1855. Ranchers, farmers and prospectors settled Moab in the 1880s. Word of the beauty of the surrounding rock formations soon spread as a possible tourist destination. So where we are. Arches is unlike any other National Park. Other impressive sites are Sand Dune Arch, Tower of Babel, Tunnel Arch, Double Arch, DarkAngel, Devils Garden, Wall Arch, Petrified Dunes, Fiery Furnace, Three Gossips, Broken Arch, The Windows, Navajo Arch and Skyline Arch. There is an abundance of wildlife in the park, including red fox, peregrine falcon, mule deer, cougar, desert bighorn sheep, antelope squirrel, kangaroo rat, water rattlesnake and midget faded rattlesnake. Approved recreational activities include auto touring, backpacking, biking, camping and hiking. Astronomy also is a popular avocation. Guided commercial tours are available. But climbing Balanced Rock or any arch in the park with an opening of more than three feet is prohibited by park regulations. In 2006, Dean Potter made a successful free climb of Delicate Arch. Afterward, the park revised its regulations to impose the current ban on arch climbing in 2014. Despite the crowds, Arches is worth a visit. Start at the visitors center, which can be very helpful in planning your tour of the park.","October 18, 2018","More Arches--and more people, too",4679,"Chicago, Illinois",5

Easy to see lots of arches and formations from the road / car and short hikes on good paths.Sand Dune Arch is a recommended must see (as is Delicate Arch), and is tucked away in a small canyon, but is only a very short walk from the Parking Area. Parking areas can get congested. Only real downside was the queue to enter the Park. We arrived ~ 9.30am. but it probably took ~ 45 minutes in two lanes of traffic to enter the park.

Arches National Park,"The boulders and stones strewn along the roadway or perched precariously atop sandstone steles look like petroglyphic Winnebagoes spit out by the gods like so many watermelon seeds. You will see a character, a person, an animal in every rock formation. Who needs clouds when there is so much colorful bounty below?This place is one of nature’s largest outdoor studios for landscape artists. The colors are intense; they slap you in the face and demand you pay attention. Set against a background of cerulean blue and cumulus, there are explosions of burnt sienna, bright ochre, taupe, splashes of carnelian red, forest green. . . .If my name were Vincent and I had one ear, I believe I’d spend a bit of time here with the elements.Here’s a sampling of what I’m talking about:","October 15, 2018",Simply Spectacular,16,"Eugene, Oregon",5
Arches National Park,"The line of vehicles to get into the park can be long and slow. Please do not ask questions at the gate - go to the visitor's center to ask questions. Keep the traffic moving. It was difficult to impossible to get a photo of any rock formation without a dozen people in your view. I really do not think there is a ""good time"" to go, as we saw long lines all sorts of times of the day. You may be in bumper to bumper traffic from the entrance gate to the exit.

Arches National Park,"First stop on our National Parks whirlwind tour. Made the drive from Denver to Moab and tried to stop by the visitors center that day to get information to plan our visit. Unfortunately the visitors center closes at 4:00pm...we got there at 4:10. Fortunately for us we did have some basic maps of the park so we could rough out a basic plan.The goal was to see Delicate Arch which is the one most people would recognize and the one that is promoted the most in videos and photos of the park. Since there were a lot of places to go we just started driving around the park to see what we could see. When we arrived there were no Rangers at the gate and the visitors center was not open, but the park was open. This was a little after 8:00am. We have a National Parks pass so we were not concerned about paying the fee, which they want you to leave at the visitors center if there is no one at the gate to collect the money. It was a cool and rainy day so it was not conducive to just hike around a great deal, but there are plenty of stops along the way so that you can get out and view some really spectacular scenery. Spots like Park Avenue, Courthouse Towers, the Petrified Dunes, Balanced Rock, the Parade of Eelphants, Turret Arch, Double Arch, the North and South Windows and the Fiery Furnace viewpoint. We decided to save the Delicate Arch trek until the end hoping that the weather would clear....it didn't, but we did it anyway.You park at Wolfe Ranch and start to make the 3 mile round trip hike from there. You start out on paved walk, but that quickly changes to rock as you ascend. You keep climbing up to about 4800 feet. Be sure to look for the signs or cairns or you could take a wrong path and end up on a ledge that you will need to turn around and go back.When we got up to see Delicate Arch it was impressive, but with the blowing wind and rain we did not stay all that long. Many people were walking down to the arch to take selfies underneath it or have group photos taken. There was a steady procession of tourists lining up to take their picture with the arch. It took us about 1 hour and 40 minutes round trip. We would have stayed longer if it was not raining.A suggestion would be to have appropriate footwear. Flip flops or athletic slides or not the best idea if you are going to do the hike. Also, based on the time of year, have the proper clothing in a day pack and carry some water....even if it's raining.If you do not wish to make the hike the Park does have two viewpoints of the arch that you can drive to. Just check ahead of time to be sure that they are open.This was a great start to our National Parks tour. Just wish that the weather was more cooperative. Would have loved to see this all in the sunshine.","October 14, 2018",Great scenery,109,"Denver, Colorado",4

Arches National Park,"Words cannot describe the beauty and splendor of Arches National Park, it is simply something one has to experience. We approached the desert scape from US-191 South and although admiring the landscape around us were feeling apprehensive about our destination, and then all of a sudden there it was. These awesome natural formations of bright red rising up from the desert floor, it was stunning! We arrived late in the afternoon and decided to enter the park early the next morning. We arrived at the front gate at 8:30am (the park is open 24/7) and slowly crawled through the park. The park is 18 miles in length (front gate to Devil's Garden campground) with a couple of little arms stretching out from the main road. It took us 3 hours total to drive round trip through the park, stopping for photo opportunities and a couple of long hikes. We only had one day to visit the park but highly recommend a long weekend to truly take advantage of this little piece of heaven.

I had read and seen pictures on the webcam how long the lines at entrance station could get, so we got to the park about 7:45 a.m. We found that there is no one at the entrance station until 8 a.m., and since we already had our America the Beautiful national park pass, we were able to drive straight through and not have to stop in at the visitor center. No lines, no waiting! We did a number of the smaller hikes (Balanced Rock, the Windows, Double Arch, etc.) and also stopped at some of the viewpoints in the park.

Arches National Park,"Moab is the obvious base for visitors to Arches National Park. The NP itself is a stunning experience even for those such as me who did not have the time or energy to explore its attractions on foot, relying instead on driving to various vantage points. In addition to the numerous arches included, the overall rock formations are extremely impressive, with massive monoliths set against slender towers and pinnacles of eroded rock, some balancing larger boulders precariously on top.The visitor centre is located near the entrance to the park, at the bottom of a steep cliff which the road climbs before revealing the delights within. The whole effect is almost one of a film set or Disneyland park, since the rock formations are so exotic that it seems hard to believe nature created them over millennia of years of erosion. An added bonus is that this NP is sufficiently close to another (Canyonlands) that a visit to both can be made with little difficulty, allowing the fortunate visitor to compare two vastly contrasting but equally delightful experiences. Finally, on leaving or entering Moab, try to drive Highway 128, which skirts the Colorado River along an enchanting canyon.","October 7, 2018",Stunning experience,59,St. Andrews,5

Arches National Park,"This is a location that receives much attention across all Media outlets and lives up to it in every respect. Arrive early to avoid the queues (we waited 30 minutes to get through the entrance at 9:00am in mid September) but the wait is completely worth it. It is a lot bigger then expected and one tip is not to be tempted to turn off to the first set of 'major' attractions you come across in the park (North/South window; Turret arch etc.) and go all the way to the end of the Park and start off with a hike to Delicate Arch then on to Devils Garden and Skyline Arch. It's also worth noting sun rise/sunset times and also sun angles if you want to get the best from seeing these locations - heavily back-lit Arches don't photograph too well! Finally, I would urge people to go and find Sand Dune Arch and then get back to the Windows Arch area for sunset - don't be tempted to leave once the sun has dipped below the horizon if there are any clouds about as the reflected light off the underside of these on the rocks around the arches makes for really delicate colours and hues. For the Windows during the day, also try taking the Primitive Trail that goes around the back of these in a moderate circular route; you'll get a great view of the Arches themselves and, usually, without anyone being in the arch opening as well - bonus!It's a vast Park and takes time to traverse and really make the most of - it's well worth the effort and whilst we had a couple of days there there is still plenty that we could find on a return visit in the future.","October 5, 2018",Just Iconic,19,"Burmarsh, United Kingdom",5

We took one hike - to Landscape Arch - but we should have started earlier in the day. It was hot and dry, so we took it easy, and took plenty of water. A couple in our party went farther down the trail, which means they went up in elevation.

I am limited because I have arthritis but I did the delicate arch trail with my wife help and I am glad I did . This is a 1.5mile in and 1.5mile to return . So that is a total of 3 miles of sometimes very rough terrain and as you get closer you have to pass thru a very narrow and elevated passage but do not hesitate because of it .

Arches National Park,"Arrive early, as the line is unreal to get in. The rocks and colors of red were awesome. I suggest you start at the furthest overlook and work your way forward to avoid crowds.","September 24, 2018",WOW....THE COLOR RED AT IT'S BEST!,29,,5
Arches National Park,"Arches National Park has a stunning variety of rock formations. The stone arches, the mesas, the buttes, the viewpoints that provide vistas of many colors, the sheer cliffs, and the balancing rocks are so stunning that you will end up taking far more videos and photos than you ever imagined. Once inside the park, there are numerous turn-outs and parking areas to capture the perfect view. Arches National Park is definitely “one for the bucket list” but definitely get up early (7:45 am or earlier) and avoid the frustrating and time-wasting park entrance queues where there are only two lines and you will waste 20 minutes or longer as, in my case, the temperature starts to climb and your hiking plans get less because hiking in the heat will be “no picnic”. In this day and age of buying “on-line”, why does the National Parks continue to use this antiquated system? As there is no accommodation (other than a campground) within Arches National Park, driving in is the only option for the majority of visitors.Fragile and stunning Landscape Arch, at the far end of the park, was at the top of my list. It was an easy hike and totally amazing. For safety reasons, you are prevented from getting very close to Landscape Arch. A crack is clearly visible on the left side. Will this stunning structure survive another rockfall? Maybe, maybe not so be sure to see it while you can.The other arch that really impressed me was Double Arch. Standing right under it, the arches looked like the tops of two rings- a marriage between the earth and the sky. It was truly magical. I hiked up to the Fragile Arch viewpoint. The view was distant but “good enough” and it was a great test on the legs and the lungs! Due to lack of time, no shade and hot conditions, I decided not to attempt the hike to Fragile Arch. Rather than visit Arches National Park for an entire day (there are no food facilities within the park), I visited it over two days. I went in the morning on both occasions then did 4 pm booked tours (fabulous Moab Jett on the Colorado River and equally terrific NAVTEC Canyonlands 4 x 4 Islands in the Sky tour). This proved to be a perfect combination of activity and “taking it easier”.","September 24, 2018",Far More than Just a few Rock Arches,140,"Sydney, Australia",5

Moab is a lovely town lots of restaurants and shopping and only a few miles from the entrance of Arches if you’re in Moab I would also take the time to visit Canyonland if you visit there are many new motels and hotels in Moab and we stayed at the Hyatt Place which had opened only a week before.

We did most of the hikes to the most well known arches, except didn't have time to do the Delicate Arch hike but we did see it from a viewpoint. Stunning arches, amazing to look at. Most hikes were easy to moderate with some elevation gain, probably a little more challenging because of the heat factor and brilliant sunshine, be sure to bring plenty of water you most definitely will need it.

Arches National Park,"What a beautiful park! We are in our early 60s and decent physical shape - did the Delicate Arch hike - rated moderate by the NPS, 480 foot elevation, and drop dead gorgeous. The hike was a bit of a challenge for us but totally worth it. The elevation is steep, almost everyone we saw had to take some breaks - we took a few ourselves. Camelbacks worked great for hydration - the park service recommends 2L per person, we each went through most of our 2 liters and it was only in the 70s - would have wanted more if it had been into the 80s. Some people went up with only 1 500ml bottle. Dry and windy - chapstick was helpful. Some of the people we saw were wearing light scarves and used them to cover their mouths and noses when the wind kicked up - we were ok but the sand can really blow around - seems that a little grit in your teeth is part of the experience! Just as you approach the arch the trail turns you into the wind and it can be pretty intense, - we were grateful some people coming back down warned us about it ahead of time, so if you go, be prepared in case you don’t meet anyone coming back down - hug the wall! And then be prepared to be amazed - it’s beautiful. Worth every step.","September 21, 2018",Delicate Arch hike,4,"Moab, Utah",5

Arches National Park,"This area of Utah is home to an incredible wealth of world-class national parks, each containing its own, unique epic landscape. The nature of Arches is that descriptions and photographs can barely do it justice. The park unfolds over a vast expanse of Utah desert with large empty spaces punctuated by solitary or clusters of unusual rock formations, from towers to arches to miniature slot canyons. If you are photographically oriented, plan to be in certain locations for sunrise or sunset. If you will be exploring the park during the day, have fluids (I drank 2L of Gatorade over 6 hours on a ninety-degree day.) You can explore most of the park with little walking or, you can relocate your car from mini-hike to mini-hike. My longest single hike was the 1.6 miles to Delicate Arch, and back.

Though I'm sure Delicate Arch is amazing for sunset, I'm sure the hike back down can be precarious in the dark. We opted for high noon during the heat of the day hoping others were smarter! It was very windy so it felt cooler -- so windy in fact we had to remove our hats halfway up the trail. We also stopped every 10 minutes to drink water even if we weren't thirsty.

This almost stopped us until we noticed you can walk around this walkway avoiding a possible accident if you cannot readily traverse uneven ground. Either way is not bad, but for a person concerned about falling the walk to the left of the thin passage is much safer. Anyway, it is so nice and cool around this arch.

Highlights were going off the beaten path and traveling the 7 miles to Tower Arch and the Marching Men located near the northwest boundary of the park. The hike is moderately strenuous, and good soled hiking shoes are a must. The trail is well marked with Carins, so if you do this hike know how to navigate. There is little to no shade , so head cover is good to have as well. Turret Arch, the North and South window Arches and Double Arch in the Windows section are very easy hikes. Caught the moon through Turret Arch. Sunrise and sunset are excellent opportunities for the photographer in you. Devils Garden is a great area to explore as well.

Every hike is worth the view, I promise. Make sure you stay hydrated, as the Utah heat can really sneak up on your and sap away all of your energy! I recommend bringing a cooler if you have room in your vehicle, so you can store ice and beverages in there. Arches is also a 24-hour park, so make sure you come back at night after the sun sets, to see the beautiful tapestry of stars above your head. I'm not one to be speechless, but I was seeing this.

Arches National Park,"This is a great park for back country hikers. But you need to be in good condition, carry a lot of water and have sunscreen. The road is well maintained, it has numerous pullouts, and the signage is well placed. The park was getting crowded when we left, we arrived early in the morning and was out by a little pass noon. The best time to see this park is early morning. There were at least 3 bus tours in the park at the same time we were. There are great view points and a lot of easy to do short hikes that give you a great feel for the park. At one point we saw a lady reclining on a rock with a man (probably boyfriend) taking pictures of her. This was not very conscientious of park rules and regulations nor was it eco friendly as they were off the trail. She was doing her best playboy bunny routine for picture taking. Several times there were cars that just poked along instead of getting off at one of the pullouts to let traffic pass. The final was when there was an emergence vehicle on the road and people did not seem to want to give up the road of it. So go early and beware of traffic. When we got home and was reading the park newspaper we saw that in 2019 they are going to be taking vehicle reservations for people to take their own vehicle into the park.","September 15, 2018",Arches National Park,91,oklahoma,5

Are visit to three Utah National Parks began wonderfully using the shuttle systems at both Zion and Bryce, and ended miserably at Arches with all the road and parking frustration and impatience of other drivers and so many (way too many) people on the trails in Arches! In fact, the National Park Service is loosing a ton of revenue at Arches NP since each time we entered Arches NP, no one was manning the front entrance taking any fees and monitoring how many vehicles were entering the park at all. The National Park Service is so foolish for not even attempting to do anything about Arches NP that Arches NP a shame and an insult to the America's National Parks!

I have hiked all the established trails in the park and some of the backcountry routes and I love it every time I am there. If you love landscapes it is hard to beat as you look at all the different arches that time has created.If I had any advice it would be check the weather and prepare adequately. If it is hot bring lots of water. If I am there in hot weather I always see a few people suffering from dehydration and have witnessed a few rescues due to it. Many of the trails have no shade and even though the distances do not look bad - doing it in full sun at 100 degrees changes the short 3 mile hike into something much harder. Good shoes are also your friend. The night sky is also amazing - great views of the milky way and everything else out there.If you have young kids and are looking for a bit of shade and a fun spot I highly recommend Sand Dune Arch.

The trails range from easy to difficult, and even if you never get out of your car, there’s lots to see. We did the hike to Delicate Arch, and while it was definitely strenuous, it was much easier in the early morning before the heat got bad. Other, easier hikes included Balanced Rock and Sand Dunes Arch.

Most of the sights and arches are only a very short walk from the main roads, not much hiking needed. It really feels like you have landed on another planet, stunning in every direction. Bring a good camera, and even then the photos can't do the magnitude and vastness justice. Heed the warnings - DRINK LOTS OF WATER. I got dehydrated and dealt with a vicious migraine the following day even though I thought I had drunk enough water. We were camping, and didn't realize that afternoon storms are common.

We made sure to start early, as we had read about beating the rush (we went over labor day weekend). We were at the park by 8am and had no wait to get into the park. We headed straight for Landscape Arch with a couple stops at viewpoints to be astonished at the views. We made a stop at Skyline Arch and it was so memorable, perfect weather and easy walk to the arch for fabulous photos. We then went to Landscape arch and with a backpack of water we walked to the arch. Its a nice walk to get there and we did not climb up to Double 'O"" arch, and we walked the short trails to PInetree Arch and Tunnel Arch. We were glad to have the water, and use the Junipers for shade. We saw so many resting deer, too! We were done by noon as we had hoped, and drove over to see Windows Arches from the car/viewpoints and Garden of Eden. We enjoyed a leisurely drive back by Courthouse and went back to the hotel for a break. We returned around 545 with no wait time again, and went to see Balanced Rock, Delicate Arch at the viewpoint but it was flooded (the road) so that was not possible. We did go to Windows for the sunset and it was beautiful, and to Double Arch for twilight.

Arches National Park,"For our second Labor Day in Colorado, we decided to head out of town to Moab to check out the National Parks and surrounding areas. We were a bit nervous about Labor Day for two factors – crowds and heat. Both proved to be manageable. Luckily, our kids were off on Friday, so we drove straight from school on Thursday to Grand Junction for the night. Friday morning, we left Grand Junction around 8:30 arriving in Moab around 10:30. After a quick stop to the hotel to drop off stuff, we headed to Arches.We arrived around 11:00 at the park entrance. We were able to go directly into the park. We drove along the road, soaking in the beautiful scenery. Our destination was Sand Dune Arch. We packed in our lunch and headed out with our backpacks full of water. Sand Dune Arch is a short and easy walk – ½ mile round trip and shaded by the arch. A perfect spot for our lunch.After lunch, we decided to take the walk to Broken Arch through the grasslands. The walk is pretty straightforward, but it’s a bit hot with no tree cover. Also as you progress along the trail, the packed dirt gives away to the sand-like ground which takes a little more effort. Broken Arch was beautiful. It is super cool that you get to walk through it, as well. From there, we proceeded to Tapestry Arch – this was a bit more varied terrain with rocks, a bit more scrub, and the soft sand. Also, a couple of easy “canyon-ish” experiences. Definitely liked the variety of the walk. It did get a little confusing at the end when you had to pick up the trail through the campgrounds. One wrong turn and a backtrack and we were on our way.The best part of this walk/hike was that after we left Broken Arch we were by ourselves. What a treat in a national park on Labor Day Weekend. Based on our timing, we ended up with midday hiking – it wasn’t too bad, but definitely drank TONS of water. On Sunday of Labor Day weekend, we got up early and left the teenagers to sleep in the hotel room. My husband I headed back to Arches to find a nice morning hike. We arrived at the park entrance around 8. No line up at this time. We decided to try the Delicate Arches hike since this seemed to be a reasonable 3-mile hike. Guide estimated it was a 2-3 hour hike. We arrive at the Devils Arch parking lot at 8:30ish – it was already pretty full. The hike definitely has some climbs – the first one you can see from the bottom of the trail, with the second walking up the sandstone. Not too bad, but definitely more pleasant in the cool morning. Also, the guide mentions walking along the ledge. While it is true, there is plenty of room and the drop is not too far. I’m not a fan of rock scrambles, but this was fine for me.The hike had lots of different terrains which made it fun. At the top, it was a bit crowded, but a beautiful view of Delicate Arch. Definitely worth the hike and if you are decent shape, you can cover the terrain in a little over 1 hour (if you don’t spend a lot of time at the top).","September 3, 2018","Great Hikes to Sand Dune, Broken, Tapestry and Delicate Arches",47,"Denver, Colorado",5

Rock formations sre lke from another planet. No traffic/crowds at that time of day and shadows started creeping over rocks so it was perfect. Spent about hour and turned around as saw only a third of park. Take water as it is dry high desert climate. Do not have to get out of car but at times may want to stop and take short stroll to get better views. Lots og pull-outs along road for photos.

The 2-lane blacktops in Arches are well-maintained; parking along the way is real good, even though there were a lot of other (mostly foreign) visitors traveling by car.

From the bright red rocks, the bright blue sky, to the burst of green, it feels like another world and planet. We did some EARLY morning sunrise hikes, and definitely recommend that in the heat of the summer. We were off the trails as most of the crowds were showing up, and we avoided the scorching afternoon heat. Many trails start to get crowded around 8:00am, and the parking becomes a little crammed. Our advice, come early in the day, and late in the evening. Plan to star gaze, the night sky is AMAZING here. We saw it briefly, but then the rest of our stay was cloud coverage. Bring lots and lots of water, you will dehydrate faster then you think, and bring extra water too. Stay hydrated.

Every arch has it's beauty and awe so whatever you see is such a treat. Just driving through the Park is breathtaking! We booked an awesome off road Jeep trip from Adrift Adventures for one morning and we went on the Park Ranger's Fiery Furnace Hike which was amazing. Definitely book as soon as you know your dates because things book up quickly. Even going on your own to many of the sites is incredible. The short hikes that we went on included Double Arch ( in the distance close by you could see a few more arches), Delicate Arch (we didn't go right up to it but we took the 1/2 mile trail to it-so worth it), Skyline Arch (amazing trail to it), Landscape Arch was such a pretty walk that we did near the end of day so we saw about 6 deer on the way back and the walk to the Arch was beautiful and the Arch itself is the longest in the world so how cool is that.

Then, Arches has vast areas of the Park that must be “off roadbed” in a Jeep or on a bike or hiking, that includes Arches that you can hike under and through. I highly recommend getting a guide and go off reading in a Jeep. If you do not want to spend the money, then arrive early and see as much of the paved Park before it gets too crowded. There are a series of new hotels almost at the entrance to the Park: stay over and enter the Park as it opens (or before). It does get very crowded, and the crowds can distract from your experience.

The rocks are massive in size and pictures can not put into perspective just how big.

On the longer hike, it was much harder as we were basically walking in red beach sand. Whether you're ready for hike or not, you can see the great landscape and I highly recommend taking the time.

I wanted to see the Delicate Arch, and so we decided to make the 3 mile hike, rather than just the short trek to the viewing site. Most of the way it was overcast, but when we got to the last quarter mile the sun came roaring out. It was extremely hot. The viewing of the Arch when we turned the final corner was magnificent!! All of the folks on the trail were encouraging and super friendly. You do need to bring a lot of water if you are hiking to the Delicate Arch in the sun.

Arches National Park,"Most of the arches require walking down trails of various lengths to behold. Because of this and the extreme temperatures, you'll want to arrive early and have plenty of water. We had to bail on the Windows because it just got to be too hot - in excess of 105. Otherwise, you're going to be seeing a bunch of red rocks. We had already done that at various other parks on our trip, so Arches felt like a bit of a let down, but mostly due to our not planning our arrival time well.","August 16, 2018",Get there first thing in the morning,24,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",4
Arches National Park,Loved this park! The best thing we did in this park was the Fiery Furnace hike that you need tickets for because a park ranger has to guide you. Tickets online were all sold out for just about the whole summere when I checked. But upon our arrival at Arches we went to the visitor Center and found out they will add more guided hikes if they have the staff to do so. They make tickets available for the added hikes one week prior to the date of the hike. So if you want to do this hike you need to get to the visitors center ASAP and see if they have any tickets available during your stay. I was there on a Thursday and they had tickets available for Sunday or Tuesday. Regarding the heat in Arches I learned that the heat and the slight altitidue (5000 feet) rendered all of us more tired than typical. Buy cambelbacks and fill them with ice water and you'll be fine. Wear a hat and sunscreen. ,"August 16, 2018",Amazing scenery,16,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",4

Arches National Park,"We visited the Arches on 8/2. It was a really hot day & wish we would have gone to the end & worked our way back. Bring plenty of water!! We got in the park around 9am. We did a number of trailheads, but I did the Delicate Arch alone. Temps were 106 when I started & 108 when I finished, hubby was so kind to tell me. That was a rough hike with it so hot. Some we didn’t do only because we still had a 5 hour drive to our next destination. We spent about 6 hours in the park, but wish we’d of had a little more time. Traffic wasn’t bad nor did we have any issues parking anywhere. Fortunately we have a lifetime pass we bought a few years ago, when they were cheap, for National Parks so entry was free for us.

Arches National Park,"$30 entry fee. If you visit multiple parks then get the individual entry pass rather than the vehicle pass.Arches is a very busy park. We had been going to the parks after 6pm as it meant we could park at the view points. We were able to park but there are very limited spaces to park in at the viewpoints. I read that during the day there are queues to get one and there is no alternative to the car.Usual affair in regards to information, you receive a map on entry. There is a visitor centre right at the start of the park where you can find out about the trails should you wish to go walking.Delicate Arch is best seen in the morning if you want to get a good photo. If you are want good light then go in the evening. We visited Windows and Landscape at sunset and it was not really that busy.Take lots of water - there was a bottle refill at the start of landscape trail.Overall, we enjoyed the Arches but we preferred Bryce and found it more varied. We do think the National Park should invest in a single large carpark and put many shuttle buses on to alleviate the parking issues but also to reduce pollution.Don't forget arrive very early or after 6pm in the Summer otherwise you will struggle to see the popular arches.","August 14, 2018",Lots of arches...,403,"Worcester, United Kingdom",4

After 9am in August it is EXTREMELY HOT. Easy hikes but the heat is tiring. Lovely scenic drive to see many arches without hiking, but the hike to Delicate arch is worth it! Balancing rock is cool. But the entire park road is stunning. Lots of stops available for photos along the way. Do not walk under the arches. Do not leave the trail.

We hiked up the full trail to Delicate Arch, which was challenging in parts, but oh so cool and novel for us casual hikers! You cross different kinds of terrain, and around each turn is a totally new scene to admire with awe. Hint: we arrived at 7 a.m. to get good parking and to avoid the blazing sun later in the day. Interestingly, the park was cool and mild until the eclipse began to fade after noon, but by then, we were already headed back to the car to drive with the air conditioning on!","August 13, 2018",Fantastic!

Arches National Park,"We took our 9 year old grandson on a trip of his choice and his request was “National Parks”. We visited Mesa Verde, North and South Rims of Grand Canyon, Canyonlands, Arches and many more NP sites.... He earned 11 Junior Ranger badges!! Arches was his favorite!! My best advice is to go very early before the Visitor Center opens. We left our hotel at 5:30 and it was so wonderful to explore before the crowds and before the heat set in!We are in our 70’s and did not think the big hike to Delicate Arch would work for us.... so if you want to do that one, I’d advise to go there first!! We did the shorter hike to see it from a distance later in the day (that was our grandsons only disappointment but also his incentive to return someday:)What we did worked well for us.... I downloaded an audio guide to my iPhone Gypsy Guide to Arches and Canyonlands and it was great as a guide. We stopped first at Balanced Rock and got great pictures and then went on to the Windows area and did that loop.... don’t forget the Double Arch across the road.... a really good one! This area is where our grandson had so much fun! After Windows and our lesser hike to Delicate Arch (which by the way is NOT that easy). Afterwards, we followed the audio guide and stopped where suggested usually... enjoyed fiery Furnace! Can’t emphasize how important it is to start early! If you have a child who wants to do Junior Ranger, download it from the internet so he/she can work on it as you go. After our exploring, we made the Viator Center our last stop and also enjoyed a picnic lunch on some outside tables while he finished up his junior Ranger booklet.

We would skip the Delicate Arch Viewpoint on our next trip. The trail is long and sometimes steep with a less than inspiring distance to the arch when you get to the end.

Go far deep into the park and start backwards. Bring lots of water and be prepared to walk to see some of the amazing Arches.

Arches National Park,"We didn't have a ton of time so only hiked Delicate Arch and a portion of Devil's Garden at Arches National Park. Driving around the park there are beautiful views everywhere. I will definitely go back to see more and hike other trails. Mid-day summer temps are hot so go prepared with lots of water, and snacks. Delicate Arch isn't a long hike, 3-miles round trip, but it can be strenuous. I was amazed at the number of people who were headed out with no water and/or wearing flip-flops. No idea if they made the whole hike. Also go early if you want to beat the masses. Delicate Arch trail is really only narrow in a few spots. It is definitely worth the effort. The arch is so majestic, perched at the edge of the drop. The first part of the Delicate Arch hike across slickrock is not technical but it is all uphill and can be challenging if you aren't used to some cardio or haven't adjusted to the altitude. A few people toted young children up with them but really had to keep a hand on them as there are some precarious edges. Personally, I probably would have done the drive-up view of Delicate Arch if my kids were too young to walk the trail on their own. My teens are both hikers and had no issues with any parts of the trail. We didn't have time to do the whole primitive trail at Devil's Garden but I definitely recommend hiking shoes and LOTS of water if you plan to do the whole loop. Landscape Arch is very cool and another great photo op. It is pretty easy to reach on the walking trail and doesn't require you to navigate the primitive part of the hiking trail.","August 6, 2018","Beautiful, majestic arches",16,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5

Arches National Park,"We visited many National Parks as a family and Arches N.P. was our least favorite for a variety of reasons. During our 3 week 5,000 mile drive we were very much looking forward to Arches N.P. The Visitor Center closed fairly early and prior to 5 pm. Fortunately the rest rooms remained open and we filled many of our water bottles with drinkable water that was available outside of the building. We essentially ascended up a mountain road to begin our self-guided tour. The provided map was difficult to relate to the terrain ahead as it lacked enough mile indicators and info to adequately inform me how far each arch was from each other. There were few if any guardrails and it was a nerve racking drive! Other drivers were on us and it took away from a more leisurely type of visit. There were several pullovers for photo ops which helped but they were very crowded. It took a lot of uphill winding driving to reach the first arch! Other arches requires a fairly substantial uphill climb on a dirt/rock trail that is pretty tricky and difficult in some areas! My 8 yr old daughter was exhausted when we reached the required viewing spot for “Delicate Arch” and it was so amazingly underwhelming and small that several people said, “That’s it?” or “I hiked all that way for that!” We continued to view another must see arch and also was disappointed. Nobody tells you that you can’t go entirely through and around the mountain and come down the other side! No, you have to reverse course and frive completely back the same route you already covered! At the end of the day heading down the winding mountain ⛰ is stressful because everyone is in a hurry to get through the monotonous drive and other drivers who are used to driving in the mountains are riding practically on your bumper to encourage you to drive faster! We occasionally pulled into the scenic overlook where we could to allow people to pass but cars rode so closely that we didn’t always have enough time to pull over! Overall we were extremely disappointed in our most anticipated visit and so much more appreciated the Badlands in S.D., Yellowstone N.P. Wyoming and Great Sand Dunes N.P. in Colorado!!!","August 6, 2018",Arches National Park Visit,11,"Buffalo, NY",2

Arches National Park,"We arrived at 6:30 am on August 3 and avoided both the heat and the crowds. We stopped at the Visitor Center, picked up a payment envelope by the flagpole, and paid our entry fee ($30) in cash by slipping our envelope in the slot. We just put the payment verification slip on our dashboard. The first part of the drive was quite breathtaking. We loved using the Gypsy Guide app as it used the GPS on our phone to tell us interesting information about the park and everything we went past. We drove straight to Delicate Arch and the parking lot was practically empty. We did the upper and lower overlooks because the longer hike was going to be too difficult for my husband. Even with a good zoom on our camera, we couldn't see that arch as well as we had hoped. We drove through almost all of the park and did the short hikes. My favorite was Sand Dune Arch as I got up right up to the arch and only one other family was at that arch at that time. It was surrounded by rock formations and you had to hike through red sand for a good part of the way. Well worth it. Also, we liked the Windows section. When we left, there was a long line waiting to enter the park.","August 6, 2018",Early Arrival Made a Big Difference,4,,5

Scenery is spectacular and pictures do not begin to describe the experience. We did not have a long wait to get into the park and found parking fairly easily even during the very busy summer season. There was one difficult bolder to climb on the primitive part of the trail but we finished this hike in about 3.5 hours. We had lunch in Moab and then returned to hike Delicate Arch.

Arches National Park,"This is truly dramatic landscape. We were staying in Moab and entered the park more than once. If you are not going to go hiking, you can see the most impressive parts in a 3-4 hour visit. This included shorter walks to get close to the most dramatic arches. Photographically speaking, entering early gives you wonderful light on many of the geological features, which tend to wash out, photographically speaking, midday. The park guide that you get on entry gives you photo hints, as in it is a good morning or afternoon view. It was about 100 degrees when we were there so having plenty of water is essential, even if you are not a hiker. There are plenty of pull over places to stop and take pictures, or just to enjoy the view, as well as a number of main parking areas for the most assessible arches.

Arches National Park,"I am driving cross country on 70 and this national park is a detour that was well worth it. The entrance to the park is 30 minutes south of 70. It takes about 20 minutes more to get to the trailhead for the Delicate Arch hike. There are a few pull offs and small lots for other sights within the park. As time was short for us and on the suggestion of a friend who grew up in Moab, we made the time for the Delicate Arch hike. It took us 56 minutes which included a visit to the petroglyphs. As noted by other reviewers, the hike starts uphill. It can get hot. The park service recommends at least a liter of water per person. Sunscreen, hat and sunglasses are also a good idea. There was a wide range of age groups and fitness levels. The Delicate Arch trail is definitely moderate and most guides say the out and back 3 mile trail takes 2 hours. If you’re on a tighter timeline and the two to three hour (time to hike to Delicate Arch) detour off 70, doesn’t work or the weather isn’t cooperative or perhaps the walking is too much for a member of your party, driving through the park and going to the Delicate Arch viewing spot may be an option or our local friend recommended a visit to Dead Horse State Park to which you drive to the viewing point and can see the Colorado river.

They've been named over the decades: The Three Gossips. Sheep Mountain. The Courthouse. Balanced Rock. And that's BEFORE you see any arches! We were there for three days and there were many hikes we didn't get to take.Our big hike on one day was to Delicate Arch. We headed out very early in the morning and were really glad to have the coolness because it was a tough hike. The bottom is laborious and the top is quite challenging. A narrow strip of rock with a giant drop off on one side. And then we rounded the corner and there it was, a huge arch standing all by itself.

Arches National Park,"Utah is one of my favorite places to visit for things like hiking, backpacking, biking, among others. However, a huge problem with visiting Arches NP is that it can be extremely crowded due to its relatively small size and very easy access to many of its signature rock formations. Visiting there in the middle of the day, especially during summer time, can be a nightmare with so many people and heavy traffic. If you're like me whose main purpose to visit a place like Arches is to appreciate what the nature offers in a quiet and peaceful environment with some solitude, I'd strongly recommend that you avoid summer visit (summer is not the most comfortable time to visit there anyway). Spring (early than late) and fall (again, early than late) are probably the most ideal time with less people and more comfortable weather. I'd also prefer winter over summer; although it can get cold, much fewer number of visitors are present. Besides, those red rock formations can be quite beautiful when capped with snow. If you *must* visit there in summer, get up early to beat the crowd, or wait until late (around sunset) when people begin to go back to their hotel or drive to the next place to visit. Watching sunrise or sunset in the park is an amazing experience. There are some trails that take you to more secluded areas, but you still want to start early if you want to avoid traffic.All in all, Arches NP is an amazing place you wouldn't regret to visit, especially if you can/are willing to do what I recommended.

We had free flow driving and parking along the entire route and stops at all the major viewing areas. My wife wanted to hike to Delicate Arch. The placard at the trailhead said, ""difficult, especially in hot weather."" Well since it was early morning the temps were still not oppressive. So my wife convinced me to join her on this 3 mile round trip search for the beautiful view of Delicate Arch. Let me preface that I am a large, out of shape, 64 yr old who had NO business attempting this hike. Flashbacks of almost dying in Yosemite last year. In fact it was my wife who had convinced me THEN to attempt a similar strenuous trail to view a cluster of 4 towering Sequoias. Since Maraposa Grove was closed this would be our only opportunity to see some up close. The hike did not turn out well for me. She almost had me convinced that I could do it successfully this time. Well, about 1/2 mile in I confronted my limitations and decided to turn back, my wife continued on. It turned into a very unpleasant experience for her but thank goodness she made it back and achieved her objective.

Our son loved running around the trails and looking at every rock both big and small! It's important to keep track of the little ones and not let them wander off the trails since the sand is alive. Stepping on the soil kills tons of plant and micro organisms so keep an eye on them. Also, bring plenty of water and plan extra time at each location because hiking with a toddler takes a lot longer than you think. What normally took us an hour was easily a three hour trip with a toddler. Overall though, Arches is a desert wonderland and is not to be passed by. It continues to be a yearly trip for my family.

We did not hike to the Delicate Arch but instead went to the Upper Viewing Point for it because it would've take a few hours to hike to the arch and back as opposed to the 10 minute walk to the upper viewing area. You don't get a close view but it wasn't bad. Our favorite place in the park was hiking out to the Landscape Arch (3/4 mile from parking lot?).

If you happen to have one of the drivers that rides your butt just pull off to the side and let them pass.

It is definitely 1.8 miles and mostly up a grade so the walk to the Arch is definitely moderate, if not strenuous, depending on your condition. Also go to the delicate arch parking lot directly and early because parking is at a minimum. You will pass many other tempting sites but you can see them on the way back out of the park later.

Arches National Park,We went to the visitor center the afternoon of the day before we went for our drive through the park. At the visitor center we saw the movie which was worthwhile in understanding the history and geology of the park. We talked to the rangers at the help desk and they were able to provide us with all the information we needed to plan our trip. The ranger reviewed the map and the key places to see. We were concerned about whether we would encounter any issues with our dually truck. The ranger assured us that we would be fine and parking/driving would not be an issue. The ranger also recommended that early in the morning is the best time to go or in the evening. We chose to go very early the next morning. There isn’t a ranger at the entry gate till 7:30 in the morning. You just drive through as the entry way is open. We had a senior lifetime pass for National Parks so we didn’t have to pay anyway. We were not disappointed with the drive. The rock formations were just a impressive as we expected. The arches were unbelievable. The balanced rock was breathtaking. We didn’t see the delicate arch as the lower viewing area was closed and we not prepared to do the 3 mile hike. We plan on going back when we do not have our dogs along.

Put the envelope in the collection bin near the passes.There were very few people at this time of day. Mostly photographers and people with little kids who wake up early. It was stunning at this time of the morning. We also had some cloud cover so the mid 70’s lasted for several hours. Hooray. When we left at Noon there was a line to get in and it was so hot. The road is smooth and recently paved. I have arthritis and trails are difficult for me, but most of these were doable with my husband’s help, proper footwear, and a hiking pole. My husband has an app that tells how hard trails are. He did a few intermediate trails without me while I rested and read about the park. I only did the trails marked easy and they were spectacular! I was so happy to be able to get up close to theses massive beauties. I am sore, but it was so worth it.Bring a cooler with water and snacks if you need them. Take lots of water. It was so hot and dry, and the elevation will get to you if you don’t stay hydrated. There are no vending or concessions in the park. Restrooms are “latrine” style, like an outhouse, so bring hand sanitizer and wipes if you have a child. A cooling towel or cooling type shirt would be great if you don’t get up early like we did. Freeze your water bottles the night before (take a sip or two out of them to allow for expansion). They will melt as you hike and you will have cold water. Restaurants in town advertise sack lunches. We finished before lunch so we didn’t need this but it is a handy service to all day hikers. Take a good camera! My old iPhone took horrible pictures.

When we got into the car the guide introduced himself and found out the other group was going to do another trip the following day. The conversation switched to maybe we should do a different route so you can see more arches. The woman in the front who was very vocal and we changed the trio. We drive around black to for 3 hours for 200. Where I was about ready to loose it was when we spent 20 minutes for cell service. Who needs cell service in the canyon.... she was trying to call company to change her trip. Hello...... there are other people here in this tour. I kept my mouth shout because I would have lost my top and regretted it later. Then the conversation went to how foreign tourists are rude (mentioned certain nationalities) and didn’t know how to tip. Did I forget to mention he talked to us 5 times about tips. Advise. People signed up sir a certain trip. That’s the trip. Don’t change it. If I wanted to drive around black top I could have done it in my own car and enjoyed it more. I could have stayed at locations for as long as I wanted. Also guides need to be aware of everyone.

Arches National Park,"Arches is one of the premier parks in our National Park system. One of the things that I find remarkable about the Moab area is the diversity in geology in just a short area. While the roads are outstanding, I think the best way to see it is to go into the interior of the park with one of the two commercial vendors that the park allows to do Jeep tours with. The majority of visitors to the park have an unforgettable experience. The ones that go into the interior, have an even better one. ","July 13, 2018",Outstanding ,36,The Cincinnati Region,5

Arches National Park,"In October 2017, my wife and I went on a trip through Colorado, Utah and New Mexico. One stop on our itinerary was Arches National Park in Utah. As we had only one day to spend at Arches, we stayed the night before in Moab, Utah, to allow us to get an early jumpstart into the park the next day. It turned out to be a good decision as we found out the park was closing around 6:30 p.m. due to road work that was being performed in the park. (Campers were allowed to stay in the park as long as they remained at their campground). Given this time constraint, we couldn't complete all the items on our to-do list, and had to eliminate several hiking trips.With a population of around 5300 people, Moab has a number of hotels and restaurants for a city of it's size as well as trading posts and other tourist attractions. Best of all, Moab is very close to the Arches park entrance. Summer temperatures can reach 100 degrees. When we there in October, temperatures got up to the high 80s. As such, we stocked up on water bottles and other gear before heading out to Arches.Upon entering Arches National Park, aptly named ""A red-rock wonderland"" by the park service, we stopped first at the ranger station to get more information about our action items and perused their bookstore. Thereafter, we drove up a short winding road along some towering cliffs until we reached the top where it leveled out. Once there, we looked at the park map and easily navigated to our points of interest. Like our trip to Maine where we tried to find as many lighthouses as we could, our goal was to see as many arches as we could as well as other sights such as the Three Gossips, The Organ, Tower of Babel, Petrified Dunes and the Balanced Rock. With our time allotment, we made it as far as the Devil's Garden Campground and over to the Upper Delicate Arch viewpoint. (Delicate Arch is pictured on Utah license plates). Again, due to time constraints, we had to pass on the trails around the Devil's Garden and the trail going up to the Delicate Arch. In addition to the sights previously noted, we especially liked the elevated view from Panorama Point of the red landscape below us. We also found that we spent a lot of time in the Windows section of the park comprising the Double Arch, North and South Windows and the Turret Arch. We had a number of great views and pictures from this location.My wife and I really enjoyed going through Arches and seeing all the unique structures that it has to offer. We also intend to re-visit Arches and complete the rest of our to-do list including hiking the park's various trails. We may also do some biking or horseback riding as well.","July 12, 2018",Arches and more,65,"Buffalo, New York",5
Arches National Park,"We visited Arches National Park for a half day with our family of five (kids ages 15, 12, 6) at the beginning of July. It’s absolutely stunning, almost other worldly, and everyone should visit at least once. It’s also incredibly hot! There is almost no shade, and it got up to 105 degrees by 11 am. Every bit of moisture was sucked from our bodies. Seriously, get here early or wait until early evening to visit. And bring tons of water and sunscreen! Since it was so hot, we weren’t able to hike as far as our kids normally can. We did the short walk up to balanced rock, the walk to double arch, the delicate rock overlook walk, and the sand dune arch walk. We would definitely recommend the double arch. The walk is easy, and once you get to the arches, it’s shady, and you can eat a snack on your choice of rocky perches. All of our kids liked playing/climbing around here. The sand dune arch is also really easy, short, and rewarding. There are some narrow slot canyons to walk through and there’s some shade. The delicate arch overlook was underwhelming, but our 15 year old really liked because he recognized this from the background image on his Chromebook!Be sure to do the entire scenic drive...it’s really spectacular and each area is unique!","July 12, 2018",Stunning and hot!,13,,5

Arches National Park,"We did several hikes on our visits to Arches this June. We hiked to a variety of arches, seeing those with smooth, thick walls, and others that had slimmer, more fragile profiles.Our favorite was Delicate Arch, which stands on the edge of an expansive area where families can sit and enjoy the views. It's truly impressive. We also had a great time following a park ranger through the twists and turns of the Fiery Furnace formations of sandstone and limestone. The ranger explained that an opening must be at least 3 feet to constitute an arch. We really enjoyed the commentary of our ranger, a long-pony-tailed fellow who was knowledgeable, friendly, humble, and encouraging. He helped me figure out how to ""scramble"" through several tight spots using my arms and legs. We also had to scooch along on our behinds in several spots. Getting onto one of these tours requires reserving months in advance or signing up as soon as you arrive. For the latter, you likely need to be spending several days in the area. We arrived on a Wednesday and got into a tour for 4 p.m. Friday. It was definitely one of the highlights of our stay.","July 9, 2018",Variety of arches and rock formations,1,South Florida,5
Arches National Park,"As a family, we have visited Arches twice and each visit we have stayed for two days. We have lots of young children and they were able to complete the delicate arch trail (which is one of the highlights of the trip) and the other hikes I will discuss. Delicate arch is a steeper, more difficult hike than most that we completed in the park. There is not a lot of shade and occasionally there are some steep drop-offs but the iconic image of Delicate Arch far exceeded my expectations. It is really an amazing experience and one of the best hikes of my life. I really think the picture on the license plate doesn't do it justice! I did feel a bit uncomfortable at times (especially right at the arch) with my small children and the drop offs so I felt the need to keep them close at that point. I also really like the landscape arch hike. It is not very far and is a large arch. I didn't take my kids to double O arch as the trail becomes quite a bit more difficult after landscape arch. There are also accessible hikes to many of the arches and unique formations such as double arch (which the kids really enjoy), the windows, sand dune arch (this is a more shaded cooler walk), skyline arch and balance rock. These hikes are much more accessible than Delicate Arch. If you really want to see delicate arch but feel like it might be too difficult, I recommend the drive that leads to a short hike (like 100 yards) and a view of Delicate Arch at a distance. It is an incredible park and a must see if you are visiting Moab. Take lots of water if you hike and you might want to check the weather to see about attending at slightly cooler times of the year if possible. This was a great place for our family and the hikes were really bonding experiences as we often see the images of delicate arch and are reminded of our shared experience. I also recommend the Jr. Ranger Program for parents who would like to provide their kids with educational experiences. My son had to read quite a bit and then answer many questions from the Ranger. My son really felt like he learned a lot and he became very motivated to learn more about our National Parks and caring for the environment after his experience at Arches. He had to work at it and he was proud to complete it and motivated to complete others (he immediately wanted to do the JR. Ranger program the next few days as we visited capital reef.

But you can beat the crowds! Start your day early - especially in the summer months. Start your day early. This will ensure that you not only hike, sightsee and drive around in cooler weather but also with fewer people on the trails. We wanted to hike to the Delicate Arch and be there early. We got to the trailhead at 6:45 AM and we were done by 8:30! In the heat of the day, it would have easily taken twice the time - while having to brave all the crowds.

There is a place to hike up to the Arch (about 1.5 miles and a bit strenuous), or you go to a lookout point with a shorter hike. Advice is to do the longer hike. If I had to do it over again, I would leave at 5am to make sure I was there by sunrise. The rest of the park is great, with some short hikes to arches, and some longer hikes. We spent about 4 hours there, as we were heading back to Denver, but if you give yourself 6-7 hours, you should be OK. When we were leaving the park around 9:15am, the line to get in was pretty long.

I knew that would be a consequence of traveling there this time of year. The kids had no desire to hike due to the heat, but this park can be appreciated without the hikes. Although I’m determined to go back and hike during a cooler time of year. I have never seen rock such a deep shade of red. The rock formations are gorgeous. I could have stopped every quarter mile to take photos. Bring a lot more water than you think you may need. There are only two water stations in the park. In addition to our hydration packs we had a couple gallon jugs of water just in case. Worked great because my son accidentally spilled his water. Sunblock, snacks, comfortable shoes, and layers are also a good idea. My son earned his junior ranger badge and the ranger he spoke with at the front desk was wonderful and engaging.

Arches National Park,"We visited Arches National Park in June and only had one day so arrived at the park really early (6am) to start hiking which is a good idea for a number of reasons: 1. If you arrive beyond 8 or 9am you will have to queue to get into the park - when we were leaving the queue to just get into the park was about a mile long (all the way back to the main road!) - not fun in 100 degree heat! 2. The popular trails get busy very early. We did Delicate Arch first and when we arrived there were already around 20 people there but we didn't really have to wait to get good photos - this would be very different later in the day. 3. Utah in the summer is blisteringly hot - the hiking is amazing but its much harder work in the full heat of the day and the trails that we did were fantastic so if you can, come for a few days and hike early and then escape back down into Moab and chill by the pool! The drive around the park is really good and there are plenty of arches and windows to see but the best way to experience the park is definitely to hike it!

Most of the park's iconic arches are a short walk/hike away from a parking area. The ""most"" iconic arch in the park ""Delicate Arch"" has several ways to be viewed in fact. There are the Lower and Upper viewpoints, which are quite a distance from the actual arch, but give a very good vantage point of it. If you feel the urge to go out and touch the arch, then the hike to Delicate Arch if for you. This hike is listed as strenuous, mostly for the long steep ascent over ""slickrock"" sandstone which makes up most of the park. Its worth the hike - but make sure that you take lots of water and plenty of time as there's no rush - it will still be there when you get there.","July 6, 2018",Arches and Mote,1,,5

Arches National Park,"This was so worth the trip. It was easily 105 degrees when we went in June but we started early and were done for the day by 12pm. Bring water, and not just a 16 oz Dasani. We took water carrying backpacks (like Camelbaks but cheaper, called Miracool) that each held 2 liters and stayed cool for 4 hours. If you plan to veer off the basic paths, bring shoes with good traction. This is more important for the downhill slopes. The Delicate Arch is the most well known hike. It is 1.5 miles out and 1.5 miles back. It can be difficult at the beginning. I would recommend making this your first stop of the day if you want to hike all the way to this arch. If you opt out of that hike, you can still see it well from the lower and upper observation trails. The upper obs trail is a hot 0.5 miles each way but it is a great view. Again, bring water.

Arches National Park,"Delicate Arch is a demanding hike - go early in the morning. After a brief, essentially level portion (maybe a half-mile), you encounter a long, steep uphill climb on a large area of exposed rock.

We did it on June 27, 2018 and started later than we preferred - around 11 am.However, once you make it to Delicate Arch, you won't be disappointed. Great views and scenery. Many good picture spots.

I got my first taste of the West when I went to Colorado and visited Garden of the Gods. I could not believe what I was seeing and knew I had to get back out there. From what I was told and research I did, I knew Arches was the place I had to go. I can't stop thinking about how wonderful it was. It is impossible to go there and not have your brain go into overdrive pondering how this park was established. The memories I left with are like nothing I can gain from any beach vacation or even any other place on this Earth. My goal was to make the hike to delicate arch and I did it. I never felt more empowered and proud of myself. I will never forget that view when I reached the final stretch of the hike. You turn the corner and it's right in your face in all it's glory. I love how you can not see it at any part of the hike until the end. If you don't want to make this hike but don't want to miss seing the arch, you can go to the view point which is a short, manageable hike. You will see it in the distance which is still worth it. Arches holds a very special place in my heart for the rest of my life. It will take a lot to take my breath away moving forward but I hope to find it someday.

Arches National Park,"We got in by 7 a.m. and surprisingly, there was no line and nobody at the gate, so we drove through. I'm an avid hiker and love the solitude of the outdoors, so I'm not sure how I would've handled the masses of tourists later in the day (we did this same thing in Monument Valley and again, avoided the throngs). Since nobody was there yet, we opted to skip the Delicate Arch hike and go through the park first (our only mistake!). Since there were only two other cars in sight, we hit up the distant Delicate Arch viewpoint and managed a gorgeous hike around that area in total solitude, watching the sun continue to rise up over the gorgeous arches. It was an indescribably beautiful experience. We could barely see Delicate Arch from where we stood at the edge of the canyon, but boy, could we hear the visitors that were already amassing there! The only downside of staying too long on our wonderful hike (where we only saw one other family when leaving) was that when we did drive back to Delicate Arch hike by about 8:30, the parking lot was crammed with cars. Ugh. Tour buses were already circling the lot. If you go in summer, I would highly recommend waking yourself up to arrive by sunup, around 6:00 a.m. You'd have the park to yourself, pay no fee and I'm guessing Delicate Arch will barely have any visitors.

The price of admission is good for a week but I bought the senior lifetime national park pass for $80. I know it's $70 more than it used to be but still, $80 to visit all our national parks and monuments is a no-brainer. Now I have an incentive to live to 125 to see them all. Anyway this park is accessible to all whether you want to just look from the car from the paved road and parking lots scattered about or take a short or long hike to get up close and personal with the rocks. I did little of both over a few days. The most famous arch, Delicate Arch, is only accessible by hiking an hour one way. Since it was so hot in June, 2018, I opted to see it not too far from the parking lot and used my zoom lens to get a closeup of it. Who will ever know I wasn't right in from of it? I'm not telling if you don't. Anyway, when it's very hot you want to get to the park entrance by 8AM or after 5:30. Otherwise you'll sit in your car waiting in line to get through the entrance booth.

Arches National Park,"We had a day to find something to do while in Salt Lake City. Since the Delicate Arch is basically the symbol for Utah, we decided to go there for the day. It is roughly 3.5 hours from SLC - and that is with a stretch where you can do 80 mph. We got there about 1pm. The line at the entrance was no too long and there was plenty of parking at the visitor center and the various trailheads. Most of the trails are easy to moderate. The most difficult is the hike up to the upper viewpoint for Delicate Arch. It is about 3 miles round trip and it is all up hill for the start. If you want to hike this, I would recommend trying to get there in the morning before it gets too hot. You can go to the lower viewpoint but it is a steep hike up to the viewing point. And, once you get there, the Arch appears very small. If you can’t make the difficult hike and choose the lower viewpoint, bring your longest focal lens- I had a canon 70-200 with a 1.4 extender and it was barely enough - wish I had my 300MM.

The gate had no attendant before 8am, and no lines either.

Arches National Park,"We have been fortunate enough to visit many national parks and Arches is hands down, one of the best. Here is the most helpful piece of advice we could offer to you. If it’s summer, go early, like 6AM early. The heat of the day will make the many amazing hikes unbearable. You will also avoid a lot of traffic. The scenery is breathtaking. Pictures don’t do it justice. ","June 29, 2018","Go. Seriously, make the trip!",28,"seattle, wa",5
Arches National Park,"This is another of our national parks that is a grand site. And, like a lot of the others, extremely crowded. If possible, schedule your visit during the off season. The park service does an outstanding job of keeping the park clean and useable.

Arches National Park,"A nice clean park. Got lucky with an awesome cool day in the middle of summer. Well worth hiking to Delicate Arch, if you have time do the windows (North and South) as well. Must stop at the balanced rock. Good value for money. Take good hiking shoes, water bottles to fill at the entrance, sunscreen and enjoy the walk. Every now and again a bit of a wait for parking but in general not too bad.","June 29, 2018",What a hike,7,"Durbanville, South Africa",5
Arches National Park,Had to queue for 30 mins in the car to reach pay entrance station and on a mega hot day lots of water needed even before you enter. First point of call as always is the Visitor Center and as usual very modern and informative. Park literature includes really clear map showing where the major sites are and how long it takes to reach each from the road. Unless you are prepared to do some substantial hikes there are not that many Arches to be seen. Beautiful scenery and the shortish walks we did were rewarding and no restriction on scrambling over the rocks especially at North and South windows,"June 29, 2018",Able to see the park in half a day if not wanting to do longer hikes,34,"Luton, United Kingdom",4

Arches National Park,"This place is amazing!!! Even if you stay in your vehicle, the views will take your breath away! They have arches to see on every level from short, easy hikes to longer, more strenuous ones. But they're all way worth it! The Delicate Arch is our all-time favorite on to hike to. My 75 yr old mother hiked to it & loved it. The favorite for the kids is the Sand Dune Arch, being a short walk & tons of fun sand to play in. There's so much to see that you should plan on more than one day to enjoy it all. The Fiery Furnace is incredible but you need to sign up for the tours & they fill up fast.","June 28, 2018",Family Favorite Place,11,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

Arches National Park,"We spent one full day at Arches and felt that we had seen and gotten a good feel for the park. There are supposedly 1,600 to 2,000 stone arches, which is the highest concentration of arches in the US, but only a few of these are visible from the drive or hikes. The park has an 18 mile scenic drive around it to see the arches and from which a number of short, easy hikes are available. We hiked around Balanced Rock. We went to the windows and hiked up to the North Window with a large group of very disrespectful foreign/Asian tourists. (An Aside: I love the fact that people from other countries want to visit our National Parks, but when people blatantly ignore the signs which say “delicate eco-system” and “please stay on the path” by walking straight off the path in large groups to take photos it makes me very upset. I wish the large tour bus companies bringing them into the parks would talk more clearly to them about this.) That aside, we had a great view of Turret Arch and walked to South Window. The crowd thins out there. If you then hike back from behind South Window, you will be alone. This gives you wonderful views, but make sure you do it with a buddy, water and a hat. The trail takes you back to the lower parking area and near the entrance to Double Arch. Double Arch was crowded and never empty of people. We drove to and loved the longer hike to Landscape Arch. It was my favorite arch in the park. It sits alone in a more natural setting. There is also a look-out to Delicate Arch, so if you do not want to do the long and strenuous hike to Delicate Arch (which is recommended only in the cool morning time), you can see it at a distance at a look-out point. Compared to the other National Parks in Utah, Arches was my least favorite. It is the most crowded and the arches are mostly just sitting out in a barren landscape. It is small and doable in a day unless you want to do the longer hikes. It is most beautiful and enjoyable in the morning and late afternoon. It can be very hot and exposed.","June 27, 2018",A nice set of doable hikes to arches on 18 mile park road; Can be crowded,233,"Des Moines, Iowa",5
Arches National Park,"As our nation expands, so does the demand to experience our national parks. This park is no exception! Plan to arrive early - 6 am is not too early, believe it or not! We enjoyed the services of a guided tour - shout-out to Madeline with Moab Adventure Center for an informative, stress-free visit to Arches. Thank you Madeline for the wonderful pictures she took of us with our phone/cameras!! Aside from being a terrific guide, Madeline is a professional photographer!!Because MAC has an annual pass, we were able to bypass the line and drive right in - a big plus. If you arrive after 9:30am in the summer months, you had better plan on a “crawl” to the entrance.Immediately clearing the entrance you will begin the climb to the park’s interior. The rock formations are breathtaking! There are ample trails and hikes to some of the more well-known arches. And the hikes vary from a few minutes to many hours to view some of the more spectacular ones.Please, please heed the advice of others and come WELL PREPARED. Bring plenty of water!! Pay attention to what your body is telling you! We are from the East Coast and EVERY afternoon I would notice a dull headache coming on - I was dehydrated. I had increased my water consumption before heading west, but it was too little, too late. The body can only absorb small amounts in frequent (as in every 10-15 minutes) doses throughout the day. Downing 16-20 ounces at once will sadly just be wasted because you cannot absorb that much in such a short period of time. And finally, think about your footwear - flip flops are for the beach, NOT for rocky trails.Don’t miss Sand Dunes Arch - it is a collection of petrified sand dunes with narrow passageways. If you have children with you, they will want to climb everything they can! This was better than any playground!!My greatest regret was we were not there for the sunset. I would imagine the arches would provide for some dramatic pictures.","June 27, 2018",Such Breathtaking Scenery!!!,27,"Midlothian, Virginia",5

There were still plenty of people there but we found parking easily. This was a moderate hike and parts were strenuous. The slow but steady and seemingly never ending climb required some rest along the way. The narrow ledges were only daunting due to people coming back from the arch and having to share. What an amazing vista at the top! You don’t realize how truly large the arch is until you see the ant-sized people climbing around underneath.

Arches National Park,We rented a car from Vegas and drove I-70 through Utah and onto Denver. We detoured to Arches National Park near Moab. We arrived later in the day so we had time only for the short film at Visitors Center (highly recommend to understand arch formations) and a drive through the park (2.5-3 hrs total). It was pretty fantastic drive with astounding rock formations & arches. Late afternoon light and shadows made it seem especially beautiful. Plenty of pull-offs for pictures and special features like Delicate Arch and Balancing Rock. Seemed to be a popular motorcycle and biking venue. There were a few serious hikers; they can get closer to some features but need quite a bit of time. It was very hot in June. Bring your own water bottle or purchase one in the Visitor Center. Bottled water was not sold in the park. This is one of the most unique National Parks we’ve been to.

Arches National Park,"Whether you only have time for the scenic drive through the park and a short walk or several days of hot, hard hiking, this is one of Utah's best natural parks. The drive is spectacular from start to finish, and there are numerous spots to visit along the way, many being easy for small children or the handicapped. Devil's Garden offers the most varied terrain, and is a fun, challenging hike--especially if you complete the primitive loop where you can escape the crowds. Delicate Arch is usually mobbed, but it is still worth the hike. All the park's other sites are equally spectacular. And many stops, like Park Avenue and the Windows are a blast for young kids and easy to access. Open 24 hours, but the car line to get into the park can stretch back quite a ways by midday since there are only two rangers (and sometimes only one) selling passes. And parking in the park is always an issue after 8 in the morning until late afternoon.","June 26, 2018",Fantastic even after multiple visits,287,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

The hike is moderately steep in some areas, so wear good shoes and note that young children will need close supervision. Bring water if hiking in the warmer months.

Of course to truly experience the magnificence of Arches it is necessary to park ones car, in designated spots for walks through and around the hills. Each stop along the way offered us a chance to get off the main road and hike into the park's selected viewing points. It is here that we really found colors and shapes coming alive.

After this section it wasn't as exciting. The hikes were longer or the views were too far for total enjoyment. VERY pretty overall though it will not be a park that we return to next trip out with all the kids.Maps: At each location as well as what they hand you are the gate - Were great and accurate and were easy for us to use.Parking: in the park was tough as well.

Arches National Park,"Arches National Park is really popular. You can see by the ratings, it is possible to find this a one of the best National Parks available. My take is a bit different, so read the exceptions carefully, it may still be your favorite.The short summary is we got there at 6:30AM, so we were not shut out of pullouts or parking lots. As the day wore on, that changed. We have a handicap card, or we would have not been able to park in a few places. I can do some modest hiking, but to see more that a handful of arches you need to be able to do some serious distance or have a 4 wheel drive vehicle. There are claimed to be over 2000 arches.The Park is too popular. The cost is too cheap. The lines (2) to get in after at 9:30 is about one hour (50 cars each)! The park is open 24/7. The pay window was not open when we arrived, and the sign said to pay in the VC. The VC does not open until 7:30, so the national parks system is loosing $1,000 every day, to save the salaries of two clerks at the pay booth! When we left, about 11AM, people were making u-turns from the line to bypass the National Park!With people parking in the trail lots for hours to hike, I cannot imagine how people can find parking to participate in the activities.","June 18, 2018","This is a hikers Nat Pk, and too crowed to enjoy",227,Escondido,3

Arches National Park,"One of my personal top 10 National Park in the States. Last visit was 8 years ago. Since then a new visitor center was built, and major parking lots seem to be bigger. Newly or recently paved park road. Many paved pullouts to enjoy views along the way.There is a new feature as it comes to restrooms. Squatting toilets were added, which was really a surprise to me as a European. Especially as I remember that decades ago people reporting from their visits to Italy (where squatting toilets were in use) would eventually mention that they hated the squatting toilets. Those toilets disappeared over the years (at least in the famous cities I have visited) I know signs fulfill a purpose but reading in the restroom „Do not use the floor.“ made me somehow feel uncomfy. On the trail to Landscape Arch I was bitten by biting gnats. After 2 weeks still swollen and itching. Please use repellent. The park itself is amazing and full of beauty. Should be on everyone’s list if visiting the Southwest.Tipp: Window Section: Don’t stop a the North Window, take the trail to South Window and the primitive loop that leads to the back of the Windows and reveals views of both windows before winding back to the parking lot.Trail is mostly flat. There is one part (2 – 3 steps to climb a slickrock) that requires a hand from fellow walkers or one in your group.

Arches National Park,"We were in Moab for five days, and we went into Arches for three of those five days. It seems that many people spend only a day in Arches, and I, for one, think that's not nearly enough. Here are some of tips and reviews of trails from our visit. *Go early in the day, especially during the summer (and go during the week if possible). We usually arrived before the booth was attended, so it was smooth sailing into the park. One day we arrived after the booth was open, and we were about the 10th car in line, but we waited about 15 minutes to get through. Additionally, by getting there that early, we typically avoiding the heat of the day. *Go to the bathroom at the visitor center. All other bathrooms at trailheads are glorified port-a-potties. I've seen worse and they definitely work when you need it. But you might want to get ahead of the game. *Landscape Arch/Partition Arch/Navajo Arch: These three are in the Devils Garden area of the park, which I think was our favorite. Devlis Garden is about 45 minutes into the park from the visitor center. Landscape Arch is a busy but easy-ish (a few small hills) mile hike to the famed arch. Beyond that mile hike, the trail goes ""primitive."" There is a difficult (to the novice hiker) uphill rock scramble shortly after Landscape Arch. My six-year-old loved it, but I was breathing a bit hard and was worried about her falling off the rock scramble. From there, there is a easy hike to Partition Arch and Navajo Arch, which I think were my favorite arches. The view from Partition Arch is pretty spectacular. You can also go to Double O Arch, but were decided not to go on. The way back is back down the scramble, which is just as daunting. Off of the main hike to Landscape Arch, there is a spur to Pine Tree Arch and Tunnel Arch. These are very close, but you must go down a fairly big hill, which means you have to go back up it. *Windows Section: This section is highly visited by those on bus tours. There are essentially two trailheads here. The first takes you to North Window, South Window, and Turret Arch. You then can double back, but I suggest taking the primitive trail back. You get a new view of arches you just looked at, and, even though we were less than a mile away from the parking lot, we saw no one. It was quite special. The other trailhead takes you to Double Arch. It's an easy walk, and there's a lot of rock scrambling at the arches if you are interested in that. *Delicate Arch: We elected not to walk to the iconic Delicate Arch. It's a long hike with almost no shade. Instead, we went to the overlook. There is the upper and the lower overlook. The upper overlook involves walking up something like the equivalent of 6 or 8 stories worth of stairs. It's the kind of thing where we went up, took our picture, and headed back down. *Balanced Rock: You can just drive up and take your pic, or you can do a short, easy walk around Balanced Rock. It's crazy how different it looks depending on your angle. *Fiery Furnace: This hike is only accessible through a ranger-led hike or by acquiring one of the 75 day passes. We booked our ranger-led hike online months in advance. The signs in the visitors center indicated that the earliest FF hikes available were 2-3 days out. FF was a very different kind of hike, with squeezing between fins, rock scrambling, and stemming. It was a little difficult for our 6 year old because of her height, but otherwise, she rocked it. It was surprisingly cool in the FF, mostly because it was shaded. It was a three hour hike, but it wasn't particularly strenuous (though perhaps a bit stressful in places). I was not a fan our our Ranger. She desperately wanted us to do deep introspection: what does balance mean? How are our lives a combination of production and erosion? How do good things and bad things build us, just like they build the arches? I wanted to learn about the geology and the history of the area; I didn't want a philosophy ""lesson"" by a 25-year-old. I don't know if I would do it again with the ranger, but I'm glad we did it with the ranger the first time. Though I wish it had been a different ranger. Overall, we had a fantastic time at Arches, and I strongly urge everyone to add more time than they think is necessary to enjoy the variety of this park.","June 17, 2018",Fantastic National Park,104,"Fort Worth, Texas",5

Look one way it’s a group of people in conversation and look from another side and it’s a prehistoric animal, frozen in time.Arches is worth visiting, but my suggestion would be to read Edward Abbey’s Desert Solitaire, beforehand. You may have your mind, heart and maybe soul opened by his writing and the grandeur of the park.","June 15, 2018",My favorite NP,74,"Denver, Colorado",5

Arches National Park,"Can easily spend an entire day visiting all the attractions. We stopped at balanced rock, eye of the whale, and delicate arch. Balanced rock is easily accessible by car. Eye of the whale is much more secluded and the drive requires an off-road vehicle. There were tours available that brought people out there but we hiked. If you do hike be aware that it took about an hour walking through the desert, so if you go during the summer it will be very hot. Definitely worth the trek though, great views and nowhere near as many people around. But delicate arch is obviously the main attraction at arches. It's a bit of a hike and most of it is uphill so bring water if you need it. The arch is way bigger than I was expecting and the acoustics are crazy. People were generally taking turns for pictures under the arch so we had no issues there. The city of Moab has some interesting shops and good bars to unwind after a long day of hiking.","June 15, 2018",Arches is an awesome park,9,,5

I also highly recommend going to Panorama Point to see the sunset and later star gaze (download a stargazing app to amplify the experience even more).

Arches National Park,"This has been my favorite place to visit thus far. The park is a playground for adults and children alike. We stayed at the Devils Garden campground for 4 nights. It was very hot during the day, but before 10 am and after 6pm the weather is beautiful and gives you more than enough time to hike to the arches. We drove to surrounding parks and local petroglyphs when it was hot during the day. The kids loved climbing the rocks, and you pretty much have free reign to climb other than on top of the arches. It is listed as a difficult hike, but I highly recommend the trek to the delicate arch. It was difficult, but if you take it slow it is totally doable for people who arent in the best shape, as I am not. The park gets very busy, so expect a wait to get in at the gates, but I can see why its so popular. If you stay in the campground, its fantastic for stargazing and has amazing mountain views.

If we were to do the trip over again, I would have started at the Arches. The landscape was beautiful, but after visiting Zion, Bryce, Grand Staircase and Capitol Reef, Arches didn't meet the expectations I had hoped. I highly recommend that hiking play a major part in your visit to the Arches. We had walked to the Windows (short hike that is more of a walk) and an uphill workout to the Delicate Arch viewpoint, (great workout, but not a worthy view). For the delicate arch, plan accordingly to be able to make the full hike to the arch for full appreciation.

Arches National Park,"People from all over the world come to visit Arches National Park. Below is what we found the best way to visit Arches, while not being crowded out.Start early. We visited the second week of May and it became crowded by noon.Have a plan and know what you want to see. The National Park Service web site for Arches contains maps and information. For us we started at Court House Towers view point. Great views of the surrounding area,Next stop was the Upper Delicate Arch view point. A nice hike up to the view point where you are rewarded a view of Delicate Arch.From there we drove up to Devils Garden Trail Head. The day we were there it was very windy with sand in the air. But the views along Devils Garden were great.When we returned to the parking lot, it was full. People in the slowly passing cars looking at you, trying to figure out where you are parked so they can grab your spot.We drove down to the Sand Dune Arch parking area around 11:00 am and there were a few open spots. So we parked and ate our lunch in the car because it was so windy. After we ate it was a short walk to Sand Dune Arch. But now it is almost noon and the park is filling up fast. So where can you go? Here are some good choices in no particular order:Go to Moab. A nice downtown full of shops and ice cream.Drive north on Utah 128 in the canyon next to the Colorado River. Great Views.Drive to Dead Horse Point State Park. Great views looking down to the Colorado River.Have an early dinner in Moab. There are many great places to eat.Head back to Arches. If you return by 6:00 pm it has already started to empty out and you still have a few hours of daylight. For us, we drove straight to the Windows Section. There were still many people there, but there was parking. We first hiked to Turret Arch and over to North and South Window. Then across the parking lot to Double Arch.Our final stop of the day was at Park Avenue. More great views.So there you have it. If you follow this simple guide you will not be one of those people driving around full parking lots looking for that empty space, but you will be out enjoying the park.Make you plan, Arches is worth it.","June 10, 2018",A Simple Plan to Avoid the Crowds,370,"Catlin, Illinois",5

Arches National Park,"A must see national park for those who enjoy the geology of the southwest. The hike to the double O arch was terrific and the landscape views truly amazing. The rock formations leading into the park are just as impressive as the arches. Edward Abbey wrote of this park in Desert Solitaire, a highly recommended read before you come and visit. Don't be foolish and not bring plenty of water with you, and wear appropriate footwear. Sandals and a 16 0z bottle of water is pure stupidity when hiking on rock at temps in the high 90's. Use common sense when considering bringing young children also. Take your time when viewing the formations and allow your experience to relax and refresh your being.

Great hike, lots of climbing, scrambling, squeezing - lot's of fun if you are in to that, with magnificent views at turns along the way. Very easy to get lost in Fiery Furnace - so probably best to go with someone who has done it before, or with the guided ranger. And wear long pants and long shirts for the Fiery Furnace hike - otherwise you may come out scraped.

Arches National Park,"We have visited several national parks in the past few years, and this ranks near the top. There are so many features to see, and most of the arches are a relatively short distance from the parking area. We did all the hikes rated ""Easy"", and came back the next morning to do the Park Avenue Trail hike which is rated ""Moderate"". Both days, we arrived before 7:30, and had no trouble finding a parking place at any of the trailheads. It does get very hot by the middle of the day, so we made sure to carry water for any trail more than a mile round trip. We did the primitive trail back from the North and South Windows, and it was a little difficult sometimes to see the trail markers, but you get some great views that you can't get from the easier trail in front of the arches. Do make the effort to see the rock art near Wolfe Ranch just off the trail to Delicate Arch. We did not do the entire trail, but the art is in great condition and was worth the detour. For the most part, people were very respectful of letting each one take a turn as far as photographs are concerned, so you didn't have to take home photos of random tourists just to get a photo of an arch. We failed to drive the extra distance to see Arches when we visited Zion and Bryce years ago, and I am so glad we made the effort to go back.

I was also lucky to be able to visit in January and in the couple of days we spent there we only saw one other vehicle at various times parked in different parking lots and we never did encounter the people belonging to that car. Basically, we had the entire park to ourselves. We went when we did because I had learned that millions of people flooded the park during the peak months and that those crowds have only increased. So for our latest visit we also stayed away from the peak visitation months and it was still pretty busy. We were always able to get a parking spot and never had to wait in line to use the washrooms. I was there to take photographs of the various arches not the other people visiting the park, thus, I did spend time at each of the arches waiting for people to exit the shots I was trying to take. Because of road construction in the park access to the park was limited from 7a.m. to 7p.m. and the campground was closed as was the Park Avenue Trail. This limited the opportunities to get sunset photographs. It was still a great visit to a spectacular park but you do need to time your visit.

My favorite on this trail was Landscape Arch but the Double O was a satifying climb. Have a great breakfast in town and get there early. You can spend 4 to 5 hours on this trail seeing it all. Wear a hat, pack a snack and lots of water. Make sure you have lots of memory on your mobile device and a battery backup. Of the 3 Parks on this trip, this one was my Favorite. Enjoy!","June 5, 2018",An amazing combination of scenery and exercise,22,"La Habra, California",5
Arches National Park,"Even on our return visit, Arches still amazes us. The scenery is out of this world. Not just the arches, but the entire area. This can be a dangerous area with young kids so do keep a close eye on them. We didn't do the trials but heard others say how wonderful they were.","June 5, 2018",Still Amazes Us,681,"Sebastian, Florida",5
Arches National Park,We are hikers but what impressed me was that if folks are not intense hikers there is still a lot of beauty to enjoy!!!!! If you can I would highly recommend booking in advance the Fiery Furnace hike with the ranger- not very hard but super fun and informative!!!!,"June 5, 2018",Amazing!!!,1,"Knoxville, Tennessee",5
Arches National Park,"We hiked to Delicate Arch at sunrise and to Landscape Arch after that. We were not sure if we could manage the steep trail to Delicate Arch, but reviews on Trip Advisor gave us confidence. We started hiking at 5:17 when it was just light enough to see. We had a headlamp, just in case, plenty of water, and lots of protein bars. All of the descriptions of the steep trail were accurate, and even having read them, we were hugging and puffing at several spots along the way. (We are mid-60s and not super athletic.) However, the view of the arch at the top was totally worth the long climb up. (It took us about 50 minutes.) The steep grade of the bowl surrounding the arch was a little worrisome at first, but we got used to it after a bit. We spent about an hour up at the top, taking pictures and recuperating. The walk down was way faster.I cannot imagine making that hike in the heat of the day! I also question the appropriateness of this hike for individuals with heart, weight, or mobility issues. We passed several people who probably use a cane for normal walking, and I worry that they would not be able to keep their balance on the slick, uneven rock. With those cautions, we highly recommend this hike!Landscape Arch was a piece of cake, by comparison.","June 4, 2018",Worth every step!,7,"Pope Valley, California",5
Arches National Park,Get there early and do the delicate arches hike. It's a somewhat challenging hike (pretty good uphill) but easy terrain for walking. Beautiful!,"June 4, 2018",Delicate Arch!,4,"Madison, Wisconsin",5
Arches National Park,"This can be as easy or as intense as you want it to be. If you're unwilling or unable to do much hiking there is plenty to be enjoyed from the car or very short walks up to various formations. The more adventurous can spend anywhere from 20 minutes to several hours to hike the various trails available. Just be warned: there is no shade, it's hotter than hell in the afternoons, and you need to bring water with you - lots of water. They do have water refilling stations at Gardens and the visitor center. I saw more than one family with dehydrated kids who were suffering from overheating. It's the desert, people. Take it seriously and plan well or you'll regret it.","June 4, 2018","Outstanding views, more than one way to enjoy",61,"Vandalia, Ohio",5
Arches National Park,Just amazing. Our first ride thru was late in the day. The wonderful hues of rocks were so enhanced by the late afternoon sun. Roads thru are well paved. Trails well marked and visitors center lovely. Book early for the fiery furnace hike. It was sold out. Truly one of our favorite Natural Parks,"June 4, 2018",Beauty around every corner,91,"Wildwood, Missouri",5
Arches National Park,Do not leave Moab until you have hiked out to Delicate Arch. The route is so scenic and relatively easy for the most part. It is about 1.5 miles to the arch and the trail is well marked. Bring water with you and wear comfortable shoes. Be sure to get lots of photos along the way. Sure to please. ,"June 3, 2018",Beautiful hike to Delicate Arch,7,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

Arches National Park,"I planned to spend a couple hours here and stayed most of the day. Around every corner is an awe inspiring view. And so much is accessible just driving through or a very short walk on a good path. Of course, there are primitive trails, camping and challenging hikes to be had, but only to the intrepid. The common 55+ person can enjoy all the sites without risking health and limb. Wear a hat, use sunscreen, stay hydrated, take a camera and prepare to be inspired. BEST ADVICE: Go Early to beat the crowds and the heat. I got there at 6:30AM, the visitor center opens at 7:00. I breezed through the check station with no one in front of me. I got to the popular spots (Windows and Devils Garden) before the tour busses started showing up around 10. As I was leaving the park mid-afternoon, the lines at the front gate were a good 50 cars deep. So GO EARLY. In the early cool hours, with few people around and long morning shadows, the place is magical.","June 3, 2018",Amazing. Put this on your bucket list.,28,"Olympia, Washington",5

Arches National Park,One of our most popular and most visited parks make this well worth coming. Yes there are huge crowds and parking challenges but planning ahead helps. Getting there early helps (we arrived shortly after 7:00 am- only a few car wait to enter on Memorial Day Saturday) and going directly to the most popular places first-like delicate arch. Parking there was almost full by the time we got there having stopped at several other places first. Make sure you pack a picnic lunch. We are in our 70's and did a lot of walking and small hikes. Make sure you wear good shoes. We have great walking shoes but kept slipping on slippery rocks lightly covered with sand on elevated hikes. Wish we had hiking shoes with deeper treads. Allow yourself much more time than you originally planned. Hikes took much longer than we thought because we kept stopping to enjoy the scenery at very leisurely pace. Also we did not schedule any time to just sit and rest a bit.,"June 2, 2018",One of the best in our great National Park system,155,"orland park, il.",5
Arches National Park,"The park has wonderful views throughout. Every turn has a different view. There are many hikes that are short and pretty easy although none are a stroll in the park. Parking areas and the entrance fill up quickly in the summer/holidays. My favorite was double arch. Spectacular and fairly easy to get to. After a day or two, many of the arches start to blur- there are so many. Definitely worth the visit.","June 1, 2018",Good for all,77,"Navarre, Florida",5

Arches National Park,"We went to Arches for the first time in May. It wasn't super hot, but it was definitely in the 80s every day we were there. We mostly hiked around a few areas of the park. Devils Garden was a beautiful, challenging hike. I definitely would do some research on it if you are planning to take children under the age of 10 as there is a lot of scrambling and walking out on fins that have vertical drops. But, it was a pretty hike with lots of arches that you couldn't see from the road. We also did the Fiery Furnace hike. Would definitely recommend this hike. We weren't able to get on a ranger lead tour, so we did it with a permit. If you like trail finding and probably getting lost a few times, you would be fine with a permit, otherwise I would definitely recommend a ranger lead tour. All the rangers we encountered were very friendly and helpful. We also did the Delicate Arch trail. Very pretty at the end. Definitely bring water if you're planning to hike more than a mile in Arches. It's hot and dry and water just makes life better.","June 1, 2018",Lots more to see off the main road,2,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5
Arches National Park,"Arches National Park is an absolute gem. It offers something for all age groups. The scenery is spectacular and the the hikes are always rewarding and fun. This was the first time I've been here ""on season"" and I have decided to only return during the off season, crowds and nature just don't work for me. Our family hiked to Delicate Arch at 6:30am and it was tolerable but there were still too many people for me.","June 1, 2018",One of my favorite national parks.,20,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5
Arches National Park,"In a day, you can drive to all the interesting geological formations and arches you could possibly want to see in a single day. Hikes are generally short except to Landscape Arch and a few others. ALL are worth seeing regardless of the hike required. Bring plenty of water, go in early spring and the weather is perfect. We went Memorial Day weekend. Don't do that! The place was way too busy and the overflow of visitors made for terrible restroom conditions and they're way to far apart. Bring your own sanitary toiletries, there's no running water. The park is stunning and worth every effort to visit including the inconvenience of the restroom conditions but the ladies will find that a major distraction from an otherwise wonderful park. Plan on picnicking at one of the formations and you'll be rewarded with a lot of things to see you'll not notice on a quick stop. Read the signs, they're interesting and informative. Don't be in a hurry, come when you can spend significant time. If you like hiking, you'll love it here. Hiking is not essential to enjoy the park but it does provide better sightseeing. Parking is adequate at most stops during regular travel times but can be difficult on holiday weekends though a few minutes waiting or a willingness to walk a short distance will solve that problem. It's a wonderland of God's creativity. Landscape arch was my favorite, especially the moderate hike in. Lots of folks older than me, I'm 69, were making the hikes with little trouble. Arches needs to go on your bucket list.","June 1, 2018",Unparalleled Geological Formations and History,62,"Palm Coast, Florida",4

Arches National Park,We had a great visit to Arches National Park. There’s a lot to see both from the road as well as on numerous hikes. Many of the arches can only be seen after a hike.

Also you need sunscreen and bug spray. ,"May 31, 2018",A must see national park ,32,"Springville, Alabama",5

Thank goodness we had great shoes and plenty of water. Once at the arch, the slanted rock was a little intimidating and I chose not to walk out under the arch. A picture from afar was just as good. The hike is not for the faint of heart. Please wear good shoes and bring water. I’m not sure I would do this hike again. We found many other arches with easier walks and enjoyed them also.","May 30, 2018",Worth the time! ,8,"Middletown, Kentucky",5

I was not prepared for the length of the hike nor the change in elevation, which was manageable but take plenty of water and time. The hike involves a number of inclines so you go up to come down several times, many people did turn around. ","May 30, 2018","Brilliant Park, lots of Arches",82,"Yeovil, United Kingdom",5

Arches National Park,"not really, but that iconic drive from the movie came to life and it was even more amazing than on the big screen. This park is so beautiful. Get up early and beat the crowds, however, if you are just arriving and thinking of buying an annual pass, don't outsmart yourselves like we did and get there before the visitor center opens....you can only buy the day pass if you're too early. Parking gets creative by late morning so it does pay to be there by 7am, get the hike to Delicate out of the way and maybe head over to Landscape before noon. Delicate is not horribly strenuous, but it is longish and we heard a lot of ""are we there yets"" so be prepared. Come back late in the day an hour before sunset and see some of the other marvels the park has to offer, that's when the light is best and the traffic is back down.","May 30, 2018",Thelma and Louise remake,19,"Boston, Massachusetts",5

No overflow parking, No shuttle system. The park is too large to be able to park once and hike to other trails. The park ranger told us that 10 am WAS peak time (schools were not out yet). The park looks awesome. Truly enjoyed the little we could see. If you go, plan to do 1 early hike per day and find something to do in Moab. Perhaps you would have better luck in the evening.

Arches National Park,I always think it’s kind of stupid to rate national parks but here goes. I’ve been to all 47 National parks in the continental US.

The hikes were amazing and the crowds were so manageable compared to the other parks!!!! We especially recommend the Tower Arch home!!!! It is off the beaten path and you will be basically by yourself. We loved it! Landscape Arch hike was great. Delicate Arch was great but almost ruined by two drones (supposed to be banned!!!!).

Arches National Park,"Unlike Zion, Arches doesn't have shuttles so everyone drives into and around the park via their private vehicles. All stops are clearly marked and you have to take some of these hikes as they really highlight some spectacular scenery. The one problem is that parking is limited at each site so you might find yourself cruising around for a while before one opens up. The drive itself is gorgeous and you can have a more peaceful experience by arriving early, skipping the middle of the day and going back in the early evening.","May 25, 2018",Go early or late to get a parking space,17,"Dublin, New Hampshire",5
Arches National Park,"We thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Arches NP. We spent two days in the park, which was perfect for us. We enjoyed many of the hikes and sites. Our favorites were Park Avenue, Double Arch, Delicate Arch and Windows. There are many trails that are easy to hike. We did appreciate having hiking boots and a pole to help us navigate the rocky landscape. We also appreciated our camelbacks for having water easily available. The rangers were plentiful and helpful. A stop at the visitor center and a short conversation with the rangers helped us to plan our time in the park. The diversity of people visiting the park was impressive. There were people who come from all over the world to enjoy this beautiful landscape. It is truly awe inspiring. ","May 25, 2018",Loved Arches National Park!,5,"Springfield, Nebraska",5

Since it was my daughter and son-in-laws first trip to the park, we got an early start and headed out to Delicate Arch. The hike out over the slick rock is strenuous but very rewarding. We passed some people who had been there for sunrise. When we arrived there were only about 6 other people there, sitting around just taking in the awesome view. We hung out, took some photos, and explored a little before heading back. Next on the list was the hike to Landscape Arch. This is an easier path. There are many sights to see from the road, but I consider those two hikes as must for first time visitors. Arches is one of my favorite Parks.","May 25, 2018",Delicate Arch!,20,"Halifax, Pennsylvania",5

Arches National Park,"Visited this park for the first time and had such a great time. So many different natural structures and trails leading to them. I couldn't tell you which one was my favorite because each one had their own unique qualities. However, definitely take the hike up to Delicate Arch and the Landscape Arch located in Devil's Garden. Some advice:ALWAYS carry water and some snacks like granola bars. It is so dry here, you'd be surprised how quickly you can become dehydrated. For safety reasons, always carry a backpack with water/snacks and other necessities just in case. Reading some of the informative brochures will help in regards to how much water to carry with you while hiking and it's no joke. Sunscreen and chapstick are also a must. Too many people were walking around turning as red as a tomato as a result of wearing no sunscreen. Carry tissues/tp because sometimes the bathrooms are out. There are no sinks in the bathrooms and they do have hand sanitizer. I'll have wet wipes on hand also. It gets hot there. There are also scorpions running around, especially starting at dusk. They can be difficult to see because they are camouflaged fairly well.","May 24, 2018",Just an awesome place to visit,29,"League City, Texas",5

Arches National Park,"Visited the park two times during our stay in Moab. The $25 entry fee is good for a week if you keep your receipt. First visit was after 6pm and we had no issues parking and hitting a few of the shorter trails (balanced rock, double arch & windows). Watched the sun set from Windows which was beautiful. Our other visit was at 8 am to hike Double O from the Devils Garden parking lot. At that time of day, the lot was already half full. During the hike we had other people around us, but we weren't ever waiting in a line at some of the rocks you had to scramble up. On the return hike (we didn't do the full 7.2 mile loop but opted for out and back for 4.4 miles total) toward the bottom there was definitely more foot traffic. Back in the parking lot cars were circling for spots. The main road of the park was quite busy and the park entrance was backed up almost all the way to 191. I can only imagine how frustrating that would be to wait to get into the park only to find there's no parking!! Get up early and enjoy the morning in the park. It was cooler and quieter. Clear out around lunch when it gets crazy.","May 22, 2018",If you want a 5 star visit get there before 9!!,8,"Greenville, South Carolina",5

Early in the morning and in the evening are the less busy times (we stayed there all day-7am-8pm). The middle of the day was packed with people and cars and we had a hard time finding parking spots at some locations and had to circle back to them.

The Devils Garden loop (with views of Double O Arch & Landscape Arch) was incredible! For those who cannot hike Fiery Furnace, this is the most comparable hike the park has.

Completely worth a visit, this is mostly friendly for families. Focusing on practicalities - most of the usual hikes are pretty easy by National Park standards. Going beyond Landscape Arch and going up to Delicate Arch are the two most obvious ones which are more difficult that a stroll in the park. It is hot and there isn't much shade, so bringing water and hats is a great idea. The road is in excellent condition, and the one thing that it might need is a restaurant/cafe as it is quite a long drive between the various landmarks.

The air is dry and the temperature rises quickly in this rocky land so be sure to use your sunscreen and carry plenty of water. You will take lots of photos but the photos will only be a faint attempt to capture the images of the wonders you have seen. Well worth the trip. If you are seeing several National Parks consider buying an annual pass. $80 for most (versus $25 - $35 at each park). Seniors 62 or over pay $20 for a annual pass or $80 for a lifetime pass.

The latter has less elevation change, but has some tricky sections on the top of some rock ""spines"" and is about 8 miles round trip. Both, however, are well worth the effort.Traffic is heavy in the park, and the campground fills fast.

Arches National Park,"Arches is a must-do in Southern Utah and earlier in the season is better. When we arrived last Friday afternoon (5/11/18) we waited a short time in line. Yesterday morning around 10 a.m. (5/13/18) we waited 40 minutes in line. Might be better to get there as it opens or wait until afternoon if it clears out a bit by then. The drive itself is magnificent. You could do Arches by car but you'd be shortchanging yourself the gift of walking through slot canyons or seeing arches that are a bit of a hike. Friday we hiked the Devil's Garden area. It's a nice walk to see Landscape Arch. We stayed in that area and just soaked in the beauty of a nice spring day. Going in Spring gives wonderful temperatures, not the heat of summer. Either way, carry water with you. If you continue on the Landscape Arch trail you can climb up the trail (it's a bit of a climb) to see other arches. We went to Partition and Navajo arches - both off the beaten path and worth the hike.Yesterday we didn't have much time so we drove to Double Arch. You see the Garden of Eden and Parade of Elephants there. You can also do the short hike to the Windows and Turret Arch. There's a short walk to Double Arch. Watch for other small arches and windows as you make your way there. There's so much to do in Arches. You can easily spend several days there. Just be prepared to share the most popular sites with lots of other people.","May 14, 2018",A Spectacular Vista of Incredible Land Formations Plus Great Hikes,174,"Provo, Utah",5

Arches National Park,"With nearly 2,000 arches, it is impossible to see everything. We stopped by the visitor center and got a great recommendation from the park ranger.

Arches National Park,"Comparable in our eyes to the scenic grandeur of the Grand Canyon, Arches NP offers a more personalised up-close experience. However, to get that, you have to find a parking spot at the various viewpoints/trailheads, and the later you arrive at the entrance gate after 7.30am, the more difficult it will be. In the shoulder season of May before memmorial day, the parking lot for the trailhead leading to Delicate Arch (""Wolf Ranch"") was 95% full at 9.15am! As it is a long hike (circa 3hrs), the cars do not turn over until noon. As another example, we got one of the last vacant spots (in what was officially a RV space) in the very large carpark at the last (most northerly) trailhead to Landscape Arch at about 11am. By noon, the queue of cars to get into the park can be 50+. It is worse in late May to end August we have been told.And don't think you can see things by just driving around & never parking.....you'll be totally frustrated stuck in slow-moving traffic only able to see some things from the road and then most of the time only at a distance.Some advice about Delicate Arch, the icon of the park. You need to plan before you enter the park if & how you are going to see it. You either do a long (3hrs) return hike to see it up close (=park at Wolf Ranch trailhead), or you take a shorter hike (1hr return) to view it from the Upper Viewpoint from across a deep gorge. In our opinion, the latter is a disappointingly distant view compounded by the angle of view which only permits a bit of sky under the arch, with the rest filled by similarly coloured background rock. So in our opinion, it's a 3hr early hike or nothing. If you elect the former, drive straight to the relevant carpark & ignore everything on the way - you can attempt to see these things on your way back in the late afternoon when crowds have dissipated a little.If you don't do the 3hr Delicate Arch hike, in our opinion, the time is better spent seeing other arches, some of which are equally as impressive. Chief among these are Landscape Arch in the far north of the park, and Double Arch (which you can stand right under).Finally, do not waste time at the visitor centre before you see the park's attractions. Sure, they have a nice film about the park but in our opinion, if you see the arches on film first, it lessens the impact of seeing them in the flesh. Visit the centre on your way out instead. So how do you know what to see & do in the park if you don't go to the visitor centre first? Easy: If you go to the Moab visitor centre in town the day before & ask for it (they are kept behind the counter), you will be given the newspaper-like park guide which the Arches NP gives out, which will allow you to plan your visit the night or day before. The Moab visitor centre also has an introductory film which will give you some idea of the geology behind the Arches (which the Park visitor centre does in more detail).Last tip: There are no food outlets in the park so pack lunch & drinks. Toilets are rare, so bird in the hand.In summary, it's a hassle to visit Arches NP but if you are smart about it, the effort is rewarded with a day of up-close & personal scenic wonders.","May 13, 2018","If you can't go early or late, spare yourself the frustration",877,"Sydney, Australia",5

Arches National Park,"Arches in Moab UT is so easy to access in a car or camper! We drove through the park and went on a couple of easy hikes. Landscape Arch was the most accessible; saw everyone from small children, to those in wheelchairs to senior citizens. It was great that so many can access this natural treasure!We recommend a hike to Sand Arch, then hike on to Broken Arch then Tapestry Arch. This 3 mile trail has almost no elevation change and loops back through the campground to the Sand Arch parking area. The only climbing is up to the arches themselves. (You do have to climb through Broken Arch to continue on the trail but it’s relatively easy). There was almost nobody out there beyond Sand Arch which is very accessible but no wheelchair access as you walk through paths that have fairly deep sand (like the beach). Just follow the signs & cairns.Must-haves: a full tank of gas & extra water before you leave the nearest town (!), a light back pack, water (this is the desert), a hat, sunglasses, lather yourself with SPF 70 sun screen, best to wear a light, long-sleeved linen or other breathable fabric to protect your skin....oh and a camera!

Arches National Park,"What a stunning park! This was my first trip to the parks of Utah and I was blown away by the beauty of the landscapes. Each park has its own unique character, and while I loved them all, if I had to pick a favorite, it would be Arches. You can see the highlights in a day, and can enjoy just driving through, but plan two full days if you can and definitely get out to do some walks or hikes to experience the arches up close. I am a ""stop and smell the roses"" style of hiker (taking LOTS of photos along the way) and in the one day I was there I managed to do all the hikes rated as ""easy"" in the park brochure: Windows Loop, Balanced Rock, Double Arch, Sand Dune Arch, Broken Arch and Skyline Arch, as well as the ""moderately easy"" Landscape Arch, including the side trips to Tunnel and Pine Tree Arches (a total of about 5-1/2 miles). But I ran out of time and sunlight before I had a chance to explore the Courthouse Towers area and I would have loved to make the trek out to the iconic Delicate Arch, but at 3 miles and a ""difficult"" rating, it would have taken me most of the day. I guess I'll just have to go back!I visited in early April, after spring break and before the height of the season, but still found it crowded and had a hard time finding parking at the very popular Devil's Garden area at midday. It must be a madhouse later in the season. Parking fills at Devil's Garden, The Windows and the Delicate Arch trailhead, so my advice is to arrive as early as you can and head straight for the spot you most want to see to avoid spending too much time circling parking lots in search of a spot.

Arches National Park,This is by far one of my favorite parks to hike. My husband and I did about 20 miles in two days hiking to all the arches.

Not a lot of people hiking that early and not a lot of traffic going into the park. There are a lot of easy hiking for families.

Arches National Park,"We visited Arches the day after Canyonlands and it’s my favourite of the two. There are over 2000 Arches in the park and whilst you won’t see them all, the Park newspaper gives a great guide of how to get the most out of your visit. We started by driving the scenic route down to the Devil’s Garden to see Landscape Arch (and a couple of others too) before getting back in the car to see Delicate Arch (which is a famous symbol of Utah). We then drove further back towards the Visitor Centre and stopped off to see The Windows and Double Arch. We finished our trip with a short walk to Balanced Rock. All of these trails I have mentioned are classed as “easy” and take no more than an hour at most to walk there and back. We also returned to the park after dark for some stunning (and free) star gazing. Arches is a “Dark Skies” Park and you will be blown away by the number of stars on show!

So while I am rating this hike as a 5 (it’s beautiful), be forewarned that the trail starts off easy and then quickly turns into one heck of an uphill climb. Just take it slow. Also at the top, near the end of the trail, you hike along a ledge.

Arches National Park,"This is a GREAT park! I won't dwell on all of the things to see, but offer advice on a couple of hikes. Delicate Arch- this 3 mile round trip is not for young children. First, it is long; second, it can get hot, take plenty of water in the summer months. It's worth the effort though to an amazing arch. Much better than the viewpoint. Fiery Furnace- For those who don't mind getting lost and scrambling over rocks and through tight fits, this is a great hike. This is not for the little ones, either. NOTE- Guided hikes fill up fast if that's your preference. If you are going to hike it yourself as we did, the Park only issues 75 permits per day, so sign up early at the Visitor Center. No permit; no hike.","May 3, 2018",Hiking for the intermediate hiker,24,"Okemos, Michigan",5
Arches National Park,We have been coming here for 40 years.....and in my old age have finally claimed Arches THE BEST. But.....the secret is out and there is more traffic in the Park and more peoples in town!The WORST is having to be on line for at least one half hour at the entrance. Those vehicles w/their passes SHOULD be allowed to go thru on a separate lane!!!!! Give me a break and get w/the program!!!!!!!!For us the Park is extraordinary....we always walk PARK AVE. Did not do Balanced Rock this trip.....no pkg available.(sigh) The walk to the North and South Windows and Turret Arch: yummy. While in years past we have WALKED there and back to Delicate Arch....this year....it was only to the viewpoint. (Those darn hips!)We HAVE camped at Devils Garden...but not this year.I can only hope you adore ARCHES as much as we do.

The hike was fairly easy to follow, but we did get lost right at the arch due to darkness and took a harder route. Sunrise wasn't as epic because it is blocked by a tall mesa behind the arch, but it was nice to visit without the immense amount of foot traffic that usually barrels down on the area. By the time we left there were about 25 people already encroaching. Highly reccomend a pre sunrise or post sunset option. A bit cold for end of April, but really pretty.

Be sure to see Delicate Arch at sunset if you can, but other formations are excellent too including Navajo, Landscape, and Partition arches! But it will be crowed any day of week, least crowded times to enter are before 9am or after 3pm; otherwise it's packed just to get in entry gate.

The arches are really incredible, the pictures just don’t do them justice. The hikes are all doable, and even if you aren’t a hiker, the viewpoints are really incredible and the drive through the park is really magical. We started with the Park Avenue hike, and it was mind blowing. Easy hike. A few stairs at the start but there were people of every age doing it. The delicate arch hike is probably the most strenuous, it is quite an uphill hike to get there, not technical, just an incline. People of all ages were doing it and even though it is a bit of a hike, the reward at the end is so worth it! Incredible! I would recommend going in April.

I don't know how they can solve this, as it seemed many visitors are signing up for the Park Pass, or hunting for cash or credit cards, and others can speed through because they've got themselves organized or prepaid. There are jams at the parking lots for the trails and sights too, all because of the park's amazing and uniquely accessible sights.Setting man aside, the park is simply wonderful. The vastness and splendor of the geology here is stunning.

The Windows (most and easiest walk), Park Avenue (viewpoint or walking, Delicate Arch (viewpoint or moderate hike) and Devils Garden (easy walking or a strenuous hike). Respecting the etiquette please stay on marked paths but there are a few trails (known as primitive) which allow you to circumvent and see viewpoints from both sides.

Plenty of room at the top to rest and enjoy the endless land. Just before you start the last streach along the narrow path, there is a small opening in the rocks above you. It can be reached by a 15 foot steep climb. To me, the view there was even better than standing near the arch. Only a few people can fit in that spot at a time.

Some of the trails aren't very long but others are - be sure to take the elevation change into account. We didn't hike to the last set of arches because of time constraints. Be aware that this park seems to busy no matter what time you go. There were a lot of people at each stop which can make parking complicated. There are bathrooms at some points as well.

There are some heights, but my friend is terrified of heights and she enjoyed herself despite them. It does cost $25 (private vehicle) to enter the park.

The gradual assent wasn’t slippery at all and at no point did I have any sense of fear...well, except for seeing little kids running around the edges without adult supervision!

If you like to hike, there are numerous opportunities to walk.The Delicate Arch hike is worth the trip. The parking lot fills quickly. It took my wife and I about 45 minutes to get to the top and another 45 back down. Many with small kids make the trip. Make sure to take water.One cannot appreciate the arch from the road viewpoint as much as being up close. Landscape Arch was also a nice walk.

Arches National Park,If you are visiting Utah is a must see. Great for a day trip with loads of look outs you can just stop and enjoy the view. Option of either short walks or long hikes. There is a great camp site but I imagine you would need to pre book as quite small and great views. If you want to see delicate arch give the walk to the view point a miss as not worth the walk but the walk to the arch itself looks great.

Arches National Park,"My family visited Arches the first week of April. The weather forecast was for warmer weather but it was cold. You need to layer clothes and take off as the day goes on. We spent 2 1/2 days in the park. You need to go early, we got there at 7 am each day. The park gets crowded and it is hard to find parking and too many people get into your photos. We felt like we were the only ones there till about 9am. We saw Balanced Rock, North and South Arch, Double Arch, Delicate arch, Broken Arch, and others. We hiked Park Avenue. You must plan your days ahead of time so that you can keep moving and see everything. There are many points to stop at on the road and just get out and look. It is so beautiful and amazing. We were exhausted by the afternoon but felt we had seen a lot each day. The hikes we went on were not too long they were either easy or moderate. Also pack a lunch. Once you are in the park you want to stay in the park. People have coolers in their car with sandwiches. We stayed in a hotel in Moab and the park was less than 10 minutes away. One night we went back into the park to look at stars the sky is amazing. It is a magical place to go and see.

Arches National Park,"Arches is one of my favorite parks. It is majestic. I highly recommend hiking out to Devils Garden and returning by the primitive trail. Do NOT do this in reverse as it is much easier to get lost! We spent 4 days here and each one was great. Try the fiery furnace area (requires a $6 permit in advance and only 75 people per day are allowed) - either by yourself or on a ranger led tour. If you go by yourself, go in the counterclockwise direction. It's not for those who can't navigate tight spaces and there is one crab walk involved in a narrow crevice.

The second day, we went out to Devil's Garden and hiked to Landscape, Petition, Navajo, Black, Tunnel, Pine Tree, and Double O Arches. Double O is worth the hike! It is more difficult, and we were glad to have hiking boots. Water and snacks are needed if hiking out to Double O. Loved every minute of the more than ten miles we hiked that day. We also drove to the Windows and Double Arch, as well as Balanced Rock. Great views, great photos, great fun!

Some hikes have a bit of rock climbing involved which is not always for the unfit. I did see families so is family friendly. 3) there are loads of spots for superb pictures, 4) toilets in many spots some used more than others if you go to the quieter spots loos a lot nicer (only hand sanitizer to clean hands so have wet wipes avl and water to wash hands)All in all a great visit and glad we took the time to go.

Try to get there early - before 8:00 AM if possible - to get to the top of the park and work your way down from The Devil's Garden to the other trails. There will be crowds. Perhaps reserve two days for exploring Arches - the $20 entrance fee lasts for a week. Some trails are difficult Eg. Delicate Arch so come prepared with comfortable hiking shoes and water bottles.

Arches National Park,"We made it to Arches at 4:00 on a Wednesday afternoon. We missed the visitor center but we were able to get to the Delicate Arch well before dark. We drove past the Park on Saturday morning and there was a line of cars that easily went for a mile. This Park is great for driving through. You can see many of the amazing features of Southeastern Utah without getting out of your car. This makes it accessible to those who do not want to or cannot hike, while still providing ample opportunity to get out and explore. The weather in Arches in the spring is generally mild. But sudden storms can just show up out of no where, so be prepared. If you are going to get out and hike I would recommend a sturdy pair of shoes. There is no need to to go buy brand new hiking gear. My kids and I made the trek in last season's basketball shoes. You can spend as little as an hour and as much as a couple of days exploring all of the features in Arches. We spent about 3 hours driving and hiking, but I grew up not far from there so many of the great geological features were part of my childhood. If this is your first time to Southeast Utah I would recommend taking your time to enjoy the rocks and arches and desert landscape. Also, if you are going to be in Southern Utah for several days it is worth buying a National Parks pass (this pass gets you into all National Parks, monuments, and historical sites, but will not cover the cost of entrance into State parks).","April 10, 2018",Busy Park on the Weekend,16,"Lyman, Wyoming",4

Love contemplating the awesome power of nature and the cycles of the Earth. Wish I could come back in a million years and see the arches that you can tell are just in their infant stages now in the rocks. This was spring break for a lot of schools in Utah (that’s why we went) and yes there were a lot of people. The first day we got there about 12:30 and it was about a 30 minute wait in line. The second day we were there at 8:30 and it was about 10 mins. But, honestly, don’t let the prospect of crowds scare you. Once you get past the entrance point, people scatter. We were able to park and see everything we wanted to see. The Delicate Arch (the most famous one) parking lot and trail probably had the most people, but it’s not like being in a crowded mall store or city street—you’ll have enough personal space. The hike to the Arch itself is definitely doable regardless of physical shape. I do hike a lot, but I also have breathing problems, so I always have to stop more than most people do, but I still made it in about 40 minutes. It’s your own pace. I just had to keep telling my 14 year old son not to get too far ahead. Lol. If you are looking for something a little quieter—the primitive trail past the Landscape Arch is awesome. We didn’t do the whole loop, but we did some exploring. It was still relatively early and there was a slight sprinkle going, so not many people were out that way yet.

The Best of Moab in A Day Jeep tour was what we chose - it turned out to be a perfect pick for our day! Paulina was our driver & guide who, from start to finish, was delightful, very informative & ever so accommodating to our needs. I have some physical limitations & needed help into the Jeep - Paulina had a stepping stool she brought out for me at all of the stops we made. When I was unable to walk to many of the Arches, Paulina found a shorter - & truly awesome - access walk for us all to take. She set up a lovely Al fresco lunch of cheeses, meats, condiments, spreads, olives, fruit, bread for sandwiches & for dipping.Paulina picked us up right on time at our hotel, toured us all around the Arches NP, pointing out the incredible geological aspects of everything that we were seeing, along with the amazing & varied ecosystem of the area.

Hiked for approximately 4 hours and still haven't seen the whole park. It's a huge, gorgeous, well maintained park. I do recommend to arrive very early around 6 AM when almost no one is there and it's nice and a bit cold outside to start the longest hike, because when we came back from that hike 2.5 hours later it was really busy and the parking lot was crammed.Well worth the USD25, - per vehicle(April 2018) which can be paid for in a 'mailbox' outside of the opening times of the NP.","April 5, 2018",The next day we went in again to actually hike and spent the whole day there easily!,3,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",5

We did beautiful sunset pictures here. Follow road making stops at the many pull-off sports back to the Devil's garden area. One main trail out to the Double Arch area. Hike the trip two miles out to the Double Arch passing many nice arches along the way. Come back & take the other trail out to a PinetTree arch...beautiful. From Devil's garden loop around to the campground entrance enter & go forward to end of campground area. Here park & take the trail out to several more amazing arches here. Back in car & return to main road. Stop off at the fiery furnace area, must have a guide to hike here due to a maze trail winding & twisting through the landscape. A must see if you have the time!

Delicate Arch is super popular, but if you don’t want to do the hike, we drove off the 4wd track at the end of the car park and got great shots with a long lens and no crowds.

It's an incredible hike, but I thought quite dangerous! People were letting there little children run around up there, and there is basically a drop off cavern/pit that I'm sure people have lost their lives at...I was nervous just watching. Our family of four, with two kids (ages 11 and 15) did the entire park in a day. We did not feel rushed and pretty much visited or hiked all of the main attractions. It was a great time of the year to go there too, weather wise, because I would imagine it would be very hot in the summer.

Arches National Park,"Lovely views and amazing stone structures. We really enjoyed our time at Arches. I would recommend starting with North and South Window and the surrounding area. You will see many, many arches. We loved Double Arch. It was majestic and the scope of your surroundings is truly inspiring. The walking here is very easy. We came back for a second day because we simply could not see everything we wanted to in one day. Even so, there are things we missed. I would recommend going out to Delicate Arch as well. It is so large and amazing, and after seeing other arches you really appreciate the scope of Delicate Arch. The walk out to Delicate Arch is more difficult, but absolutely worth it. You cannot understand the scope of it from either the 1st or 2nd viewing point. It was breathtaking.Don't let the line to enter the park discourage you. We waited about 20-30 mi s each day at the entrance, but once we were in it didn't feel too crowded most of the time. There are only so many parking spots at each stop, so parking spots are limited at times. We received advice to take the first spot you see and this was a good tip. Water is available outside visitors center. We refilled gallon jugs for free. This was a huge help to us. Pack food in for snacks, lunch. No food available in the park. Rangers were super helpful at the visitors center. We never saw a ranger out in the park. People were for the most part very polite and aware of their surroundings and respected the rules of the park. It is incredibly clean and well maintained. I understand Arches may move to a reservation based system as soon as next year. I would call ahead to be sure you can get in. I think it is our favorite National Park so far.","March 30, 2018",Great experience at Arches National Park.,0,,5

We really only spent a short time in the park but we loved it. Delicate Arch is a must do! I think going earlier in the morning avoids more crowds so I would recommend that. We only got there at 9:00 am but by the time we left at 12:00 there were so many more people hiking up to the arch. Parking is also much better if you get there earlier. They have bathrooms there which is nice, we didn't use them but they seemed like park bathrooms so a little fancier than a port-a-potty. We were also able to make it to ""The Windows"" arches a different day but it was so windy and cold and lightly snowy so we didn't stay long but it was awesome! The ""Garden of Eden"" arches looked really cool but it was too cold for the family to go out anymore. There was more we wanted to see and do but because of our timing and weather we only saw a little but we loved it. Even if you can only spend half a day there it is worth it.

The first time I hiked it, it was life-changing. Since then, always awe-inspiring. It is a dynamic trail & not strenuous if the weather is mild, even for my 4 year old. She bounded up and down the trail. It took us about 2.5 hours all in all with her walking herself. Do not waste your energy on the shorter (1 mile?) hike down the road.

Arches National Park,Arches NP is a must do in Moab. You need at least 2 full days and probably 3 days to really explore everything there is to see in this huge park. We spent 3 days in the park to do several long hikes and visit all of the arches and photo opportunities there are in Arches. We got to Arches in the afternoon and started with the hike into Park Avenue. Then we went right to the 3 mile hike up to Delicate Arch to catch the Arch at sunset. It was awesome up at Delicate Arch and even though it wasn’t a clear sky we still got some great photos. We also did the 3+ mile hike up to Partition Arch. That was a fun and strenuous hike. There are several arches up there and you are at the top of the park so you get some great photos up there. Windows Arch and Turret Arch are also worth going to visit. They are right next to each other and it’s a real short hike ( .3 mile ). This park was my favorite park ever to visit. I am glad I went during the week as it gets crazy busy on the weekends. We drove past on Saturday morning and the line of cars was soooo long that it would take at least an hour to get to the gate to pay to enter the park. I can only imagine how busy and crowded to gets here during the warmer months. I think March/April is the best time to visit Arches before it gets too hot and too crowded.

Be sure to carry plenty of water, wear a hat and use sunscreen as there is little protection from the desert sun. Do not miss Sandbox Arch, Broken Arch. Landscape Arch, and the Windows. Hike over to Turret Arch for a fabulous view of the Windows. Delicate Arch is the highlight. It is the most distant arch and the hike is mostly over exposed red rock, so it gets extremely hot.

I keep saying to people who ask me, if I could guess what the planet Mars looks like: Arches NP is it!!! It was the most beautiful and unique I have ever seen. We did the (not so easy) hike up to Delicate Arch and it was so breathtakingly beautiful that a tear actually came to my eye! We went to lots of other places in the park as well and my favourite was the Devil's Garden area which is at the very end of the park. We hiked to several arches in there. The trails are clearly marked and go up and down to give the less fit hiker a chance to recover. We saw people of all ages, stages and abilities there so it's definitely accessible to a lot of people. In summary of Arches National Park, all I can simply say is WOW! I will be back for sure, already planning the next trip!!","March 19, 2018",Out of this world,21,Grand Forks,5

Arches National Park,"Having been to Arches many times my last visit was a let down. Coming in from the north, traffic lines to the entrance was backed up to the highway, so much for the view at sunset. Went back in the early morning to catch it at sunrise. Not as many people so it was better. Winter is a great time to visit the park. The red rocks and a dusting of snow is spectacular. The road construction going on was a distraction but needed to be done. The completion of the road system should improve the traffic control.","March 19, 2018",Worth a visit,5,"Mission, Texas",5
Arches National Park,To see the delicate arch you can view it from afar at the viewpoint area or you can take a 1.5mi hike to see it closer. Try to hike in the morning before it really gets hot because there are no trees or shades available. ,"March 18, 2018",nice view,2,"Houston, Texas",5
Arches National Park,"One of the greatest places I have ever been. The road takes you into the park with countless stops along the way, with amazing views and unique rock formations. If you like hiking, save enough time to hike to the famous Delicate Arch (couple hour hike). Otherwise, see if from afar at the viewpoint. You can get up close to Balanced Rock and the North/South Windows. I like photography and took hundreds of photos in a short 3-4 hour time span. Stay for the sunset and watch the stars and moon illuminate the landscape. An unforgettable experience.","March 18, 2018","Unique rock formations, well worth the visit",91,"Dallas, Texas",5

Arches National Park,This was our second visit to Arches national Park and we enjoyed it just as much as the first time. Hiked to Delicate Arch early in the morning and got some awesome pictures and enjoyed just relaxing in the beauty. Stopped and saw Sand Stone arch and Broken Arch and took a short hike. Both of these are worth seeing. We drove the rest of the park and stopped at many great spots. The entire park is worth seeing. It’s awesome! ,"March 17, 2018",Must see!,34,"Cypress, California",5

Arches National Park,"I highly recommend visiting this park. There is such amazing views and something for everyone. Some of the arches are accessible by walking path, but there are also hiking trails as well. If you're not into hiking there are tons of pull off from the main route by car to take in the amazing vistas. I recommend going early in the day as it is much less crowded and the light makes the rocks turn a deep red as it rises above the desert. We enjoyed watching the rock climbers as well. Something for everyone!","March 17, 2018",Incredible!!,0,"Richmond, Virginia",5
Arches National Park,Nature at its finest. Only God can create such awesome scenery. The Windows was my favorite. It was also the easiest to access. Just a short walk with very little incline.

Great experience. ,"March 17, 2018",Beautiful Views Galore!,14,,5

You drive the main roads in your car, but you can get out & bike to different rock formations & Arches. Some are super short, others are several miles long, so you can choose how much exercise you want depending on your group, how much time you have, and the weather that day. We go back every year!

Arches National Park,"There are so many beautiful sights on the drive to this park that you may think that there is no reason to go to the park! Don't do that. The park is really special and needs to be experienced from ""top to bottom"" on the full park drive. The drive through the park can be compressed if you are short on time, but I really suggest that you get out and take a walk at some of the more interesting arches. The drive is just an experience that is an opportunity to see beauty on a micro and macro level at every turn. The vistas are breathtaking--no other word for it. The individual arches are beautiful as well as the balancing rocks, columns and outcroppings. An artist could paint a million salable pictures here and not begin to scratch the surface of the potential.Parking is a ""competitive sport"" in this park. There are far too few slots for the number of visitors. There are a number of climbers and hikers that leave their car for many hours in a slot. There are also a number of large vans and motorhomes. We were there at low season--I can't imagine how bad it is at high season. I have no suggestions as to what to do on this issue. Fortunately, there are some turn outs along the road to get long range views of some of the vistas, but not many of the arches. Make certain you have water and some energy bars--there are NO Services in the park.","March 16, 2018","Bucket list!

Arches National Park,"We have been to Arches 7 or 8 times. (We live in Ohio) We enjoy the dry heat of the desert. As long as you stay hydrated, it seems you can hike all day. A wide brim hat is recommended with plenty of sunscreen. There are so many great hikes to various arches. Delicate Arch is a fairly tough up hill climb that seems to go on forever. Do not try this hike in the middle of the day. An out of the way hike is the tough one to Tower Arch if you want one away from all the people. And Moab is really a neat town. High elevation desert with the Colorado River running by. It is a unique area.","March 12, 2018",One of our favorites.,24,"Canton, Ohio",5
Arches National Park,"Had some friends over and soon discussion turned to making a quick trip to wander through and photograph Arches again. So we headed off. Arches has been a favorite for me since my parents took me the first time when I was 16 (long time ago). The first trip whetted my appetite with the truly majestic views that I was only allowed to view from the car window as “we didn’t have time to get out of the car”. Since that time I have been back many times, but on my own schedule which allows for long hikes through this splendid artwork of Mother Nature. This trip was another great experience especially as we had some newbies with us. Sad to see some old friends (Arches) have succumbed to gravity, but always new sights to see as well as old friends. The lighting - time of day and time of year continues to reveal new views of splendor. Remains my favorite national park - you must go if you have not experienced it yet.

Arches National Park,"We rode our bicycles over the length of the park road - starting after the initial climb into the park. We also hiked several of the trails leading to various arches. The striking beauty and uniqueness ot the landscapes make this park a must see.

Arches National Park,Recently hiked Arches National Park with the family. The sights there are blow you away amazing. Like nothing we have ever seen! We stuck to easy/moderate hikes. We were able to handle them with little trouble and we are not fitness freaks. Two of us are seniors and one twenty something. The air is somewhat thinner than what we are used to in NJ. So just take your time and drink plenty of water and you should be fine. March is a great time to visit. The temps are cool and the tourist are few. Parking was easy and the roads were not congested. There is no food service in the park so bring your own if you plan on having a meal. You can still enjoy Arches even if you are not into hiking. Many of the points of interest can be seen from the road side stops. ,"March 12, 2018",Close to a religious experience,6,,5

You could probably drive from one end to the other in a couple hours. But you would be short changing yourself. Take the time to explore the unique beauty of this place. Two must do's are the hike to delicate arch (a bit challenging) and the much easier hike to landscape arch. There are many more exploration opportunities which are too numerous to list here.

No long hikes are needed to see all the sites. We did all 5 Utah National Parks and Ae he’s was one of our favorites. Finding the Ae he’s on the trails was fun and the walking was very easy.

It is noted for the arches but the red rocks as well as the Moab fault and the mountains in the distance drops your jaw at every turn. The park is well-designed with plenty of access roads and stopping points along the road to permit use of the vistas and photographs if so desired.

Arches National Park,"Our National Parks are all exceptional places. Unfortunately, they have become popular with citizens of the US and elsewhere in the world. The trails, viewpoints, and other places of interest are having to accomodate more people than in the past, and this can reduce the enjoyment of being there. We visited in early March. There were no lines to get into the park, and no parking problems. Because of the lower temperature (50's), hiking to Delicate Arch was a pleasurable experience. The only downside of visiting during the off-season is a possibility of snow or muddy trails. It is our recommendation that early spring is probably the best time to visit Arches N.P. and the Moab area.","March 10, 2018",Visit during the off season,13,"St. George, Utah",5
Arches National Park,"This park has spectacular arches and views of the La Sal mountains. Every arch is unique and vary in their access. Some require hikes of up to 2-3 hours where others are relatively short. I have been here twice now and I still haven't seen everything so a lot of time would be required to actually see all of the arches. The fiery finance was amazing too and quite a unique experience. The national park service offers guides through the fiery furnance now and has since prohibited tourist companies from guiding through the fiery furnance. There is some wildlife but they are relatively smaller animals like lizards, birds, chipmunks, and rabbits. There is a possibility of seeing a coyote or large birds but I have yet to see some. I would recommend going in early in the morning or later in the evening when it isn't as busy. I also recommend going before the summer as I did because there isn't as much people and the weather is between 40-60 degrees which is nice. If you go to arches do not leave the trails because you will step on ecological crust. Ecological crust is needed to sustain plant life in the desert and takes about a hundred years to replenish a small area. Delicate arch is the most famous of the arches and requires 2-3 hours I believe to hike up and down while stopping to take pictures. The hike is quite strenuous and windy. The whole hike is exposed to the sun so bring plenty of water and wear appropriate footwear. I saw people walking up in flip flops and business shoes. Enjoy the arches before they start enforcing the reservation policy.","March 10, 2018",Beautiful National Park,2,,5
Arches National Park,Decided to detour off the interstate and make a quick visit. What a mistake. Should have stopped for 2 days. We would have spent an entire day hiking around and exploring the visitors center. The sand dunes arch was cool.

Arches National Park,"Arches NP is a nirvana for the geology and geomorphology enthusiast, it is a landscape of contrasting hues, sculptured land forms and textures unlike anything we had seen before on our travels. There are over two thousand arch formations along with pinnacles, balancing rocks, cliffs and fins. All as a result of the unique geology of the area sculptured by rain, wind, ice and sun over millennia to form this natural “architecture” resulting in a photographer’s paradise of natural beauty. These rocks are visible in layer cake fashion throughout most of the park, the salmon-colored Entrada Sandstone, in which most of the arches form, and the buff-colored Navajo Sandstone, differential eroded create this distinctive topography. Resulting in sunrises and sunsets like no other place on earth. The names of the features are testament to the forces that have forged this landscape. Fiery Furnace, Tower of Babel, Delicate Arch, Balanced Rock, Petrified Dunes, Landscape Arch and The Devils Garden to name some of them.To really appreciate the features in the park, one needs at least two days, three would be best. We had one morning to drive from the Visitor’s Center to the Devils Garden, so were only able to take in the features along the main route. We had planned to walk to the Delicate Arch, which is a must if you visit, but due to the parking being full we drove on to the lookout a bit further down the road, but still had some great pictures of the arch. Further stops to visit the Landscape Arch, Fiery Furnace and Balancing Rock and back to the Visitor Center.There are numerous parking stops along the way, from which you can walk to see other features, some are short, others longer and require taking lots of water. The paths are demarcated so please keep to them, as there is clear evidence of people wander off them and adding to the natural erosion, please don't, if you are a true nature lover you won't. This is worth a stop on anyone’s road trip to this part of the US and is a definite return place for our next US visit, but probably later in the year as August was very warm and walking is tough in the heat and terrain. There are however plenty of water points and a quick visit to the Rangers at the Visitor Center will help you plan your activities.","March 7, 2018","Red Rock, Geological and Geomorphological Wonderland",463,Pretoria,5

Arches National Park,"We had been wanting to get to this park for a long time, and were really glad we finally got to visit. I’m also glad we chose to visit in May before it gets intolerably hot! There’s more than 76,000 acres of high desert in this park, bordered to the south by the Colorado River, which we camped beside for part of our visit. What I didn’t know before coming here is that the entry and visitors center is basically the lowest elevation in the park, so right beyond the visitors center, the park road immediately takes you up 1,200 feet or so. From there, you proceed north and you pass a lot of other formations before you see any arches. There’s Park Avenue, The Organ, the Three Gossips, Sheep Rock, Tower of Babel, Petrified Dunes, The Great Wall, and balanced Rock. The arches begin in earnest in the Windows Section of the park where some of the park’s bigger and more famous arches are located, including the North Window and South Window, Turrett Arch, and Double Arch. Even in the off season, parking can be a challenge were by mid-morning. From here, you go further north, past the turnoff to Delicate Arch (which we only saw from the viewpoint), then on past the Fiery Furnace Viewpoint, which was a very different formation. When we were here, the Devil’s Garden area was closed, and because the entire park was undergoing road work, the park closed early on weeknights. So the Sand Dune Arch, and Broken Arch, were as far as we were able to go in the park. We were able to come back one weekend night, and got to see a nearly full moon rise over the North Arch. It was amazing, much cooler, and there were a lot less people in the park.

I got a beautiful picture of Balance Rock with the sun rising behind it. Great decision and I strongly recommend going early. We drove to the area where we could hike only a mile (or less) to view Delicate Arch. It is an easy hike and we just wanted to view it from a distant, It was about 8:30 am, and again, only 2 more couples were there. We then drove to Windows Section and walked the trail to the Landscape Arch (.8 miles) and then to Double O Arch which was about 2 miles. You can continue to the Devils Garden Trail (7.2 miles) if want. At 8:30 am there only a few cars and few people so the hike was quiet and peaceful. When we were returning from the hike about 11 - 11:30 am, the number of the people starting on the trail was numerous and the parking lot was quite full. Most were in groups and talking (or I will be chattering) loudly. We were so glad we chose to come early. We stopped at the Visitors' Center on the way out and it was getting crowded. I was not too impressed with the Center; it seemed it was more to get information than displays, etc. The video was informative, however.","February 10, 2018",Fabulous!,69,"Festus, Missouri",5

And if you have young children prepare for additional time and potentially snack breaks/or a picnic. We saw several families on the Trail with jogging strollers. You mostly are going uphill on rock. At points there was snow/ice. I would recommend a Hiking carrier or baby carrier. It’s a gorgeous park. One of the most beautiful places I’ve ever seen. The Red Rock reminds me of Sedona Arizona.

An enjoyable hike up from the parking lot. Quite a number of other tourists there with the same idea. Eventually the people stopped crowding the arch so everyone else could get their own photos.

Arches National Park,"This is one of the most beautiful National Parks I’ve been to, to date. My Boyfriend and I went there to enjoy the scenery and hike. We went well prepared for the hike - packed a backpack (each) containing:- a tumbler of water- snacks - dried fruit, beef jerky, nuts, chocolate (basically things that last and contain essential nutrients we would need to sustain ourselves in the event of a mishap - ie if we got lost, stranded, or injured and stuck in a place that’s difficult to be found)- knife (in case we were stuck, in a compromised position and were attached by the wildlife. Eg mountain lions - layers of clothing - and a thick fleece jacket; you’re out in the wilderness and you need to prepare to shield yourself from the elements - hat and sunglasses- chapstick - small flashlight with strobe light- headlamps for when the sun went down - mini first aid kit - antibacterial wipes and hand sanitizer—> these were the basicsThere were a few hiking trails (categorised from easy to primitive, the latter being really difficult). The primitive one seemed more exciting (on hindsight) and is not for the faint hearted (to me at least as I’m a novice who’s afraid of heights). You absolutely HAVE to go decked in proper hiking gear, especially when it comes to the shoes (Timberland boots in my opinion are one of the best), as you’ll need to best grid to ascend the narrowest rocks of the steepest gradients, with no barrier or protection in place. Climb at your own risk! The descend down the canyons are far more difficult, you’d have to be really careful going down the steep declines to prevent slipping or even tripping and falling off! The views you get at the top are well worth the heart Attack-inducing climbs! Highly recommended ","January 21, 2018",Hiking in Paradise,31,"Singapore, Singapore",5

It's like being in an episode of a coyote and roadrunner cartoon! (especially Balancing Rock). I would say the must sees are:Delicate Arch- hike up to it if you can, hard but worth it (3 miles roundtrip mostly uphill, 2 to 2 1/2 hours roundtrip), but it can also be seen from the road below at the Delicate Arch ViewpointsLandscape Arch- longest arch in North America, about a 45 minute hike roundtrip, fairly flat and easyWindows/Double Arch/Turret Arch- these are all in the same area, you can park in one spot and go to all of them- all are very short and easy hikes (10 mins or so) and all are awesome, but Double Arch is particularly awe inspiring if you get up underneath itThe roads and trails are all well marked and maintained, and the rangers were great. Stay in Moab, a nice little town about 10 minutes away from Arches. Also, make a short day trip to Canyonlands and Dead Horse Point State Park if you have time.

PLEASE BE PREPARED. We definitely regretted not following the water guidelines to the ounce. Hiking to the Delicate Arch from the parking lot absolutely requires at least a half gallon of water PER PERSON. We had three kids with us and were rationing water to last us for the return hike. Not good. There are no water fountains at this specific location, if I remember correctly. You may also want to consider granola bars. This hike took us about 3 hours roundtrip and was totally worth it! The arid hills are very challenging and there is limited shade, which is a HOT commodity along the path. Take breaks, but keep on trekking, and you will be rewarded with the most amazing site of the Delicate Arch. Just Fantastic! My kids are 12, 14, and 16. We all struggled a bit, but made it.

I used to blame my friend on why he didn't include Canyonlands when we were in Moab in 2007, since Canyonlands is just 30 miles away from Arches. This year, after the visit to Canyonlands, I know why he only included Arches. While Canyonlands is not bad, Arches is definitely much more captivating. The color, the rocks and the walls are just so unique that as a frequent world traveler, it is something that I do not see often in other places such as Europe, other parts of America and Canada. Therefore, this is a must-go place in the area, along with all the other parks in Utah such as Zion, Bryce, ... just go to every one of them if you loves it unique orange color of rock formation.","January 9, 2018","I once blamed my friend on why he didn't include Canyonlands in our trip to Moab, now I know why...",7,"Pleasanton, California",5

Tourist buses and their throngs block a lot of the trailheads at times. Luckily, most do not continue on further down the trails and the crowds thin quickly.

Arches National Park,"This park is full natural beauty and places to stop for photo opportunities right from the beginning. It is best to go early as the line can back up to the road. we learned this from visiting a local biking shop. We also learned that you can view the park entrance live online to check out the line as well. The best advice is to stop at the visitor center to get water and go to the restroom as there are not too many in the park, and the lines can be long. Make sure you see what trails are for beginners to advanced. We learned the hard way. The Delicate Arch is a must see we had planned before entering, but we did not see that there were two ways to view and ended up hiking on an advanced trail with small kids. We had to turn around and go back since there were some narrow walkways and cliffs. Chalk it up to inexperience, but we learned fast and enjoyed the many other trails and breath-taking views. Also, wear layers, preferably a wind-breaker or jacket as that wind can be freezing, and then you can be comfortable all day and adjust as the weather permits.

Arches National Park,"This was my second time to the park. there is so many beautiful sights to see and so many arches. The colors on the Rocks against the blue sky is a site that everyone must see. This time we took my parents who are elderly. They have never been there and my dad still can't stop talking about how beautiful it is there. I was glad that was able to take them there and see the Majestic mountains and arches. Not only is the park amazing butts or the surrounding areas we got to see petroglyphs ,dinosaur footprints, dinosaur bones, and of course Colorado River. It's a must for any outdoor lover.","December 29, 2017",AAAA-Mazing,2,,5
Arches National Park,"It had been more than 40 years since we had been in Moab. Wow totally unrecognizable! However the raw natural beauty the abounds in Arches National Park remains amazing. Whether you just drive the scenic route, or hike several of the wonderful trails to the arches, anytime spent here is time well spent. We really enjoyed the new handouts you get, in addition to the map, when you enter the park. They are a wealth of information and really do help plan your stay based on how much time you have. They are a great tool for prioritizing what you particularly want to see. The views are breathtaking at every turn and some of the formations mind boggling.

Arches National Park,"We spent 1 1/2 days here to get our fill of hikes and photos. Glad we didn't shorten the visit. The park is notoriously busy in summer, wonderfully quiet in winter. We visited in snow which was magical, a lovely contrast to the red sandstone, and easy to walk in IF YOU WORE YAKTRAX. These are cheap spikes for your boots, sold at the visitors' center for $11/pair and necessary when trails get icy (snow melts in day's sun then freezes at night). If you're visiting in high season, Google for the webcam at the entrance station that will show you how may cars are on the entrance road - this can help you judge your arrival time. Try for a variety of hikes/viewpoints when there. Yes, the Delicate Arch trail is terrific, but so is Park Avenue (a little canyon) with different views. And the Sand Dune arch is a short, cool sandpit for all ages.","December 28, 2017","spend a full day - bring yaktrax in winter, water in summer",50,"Seattle, Washington",5

Arches National Park,"Caution with choice of footwear is advised when hiking on snow. Grooved bottom shoes/boots help but those wearing UGGS were slipping and sliding. Due to snow covered trails and icey spots we chose to set out in late afternoon. Good choice for morning trails are Double Arch, Turret, North and South Windows. The trek up and up is so worth it as the arch suddenly appears and you have that “ahhh” moment. You will remember it without the photos.","December 27, 2017",Delicate Arch in Winter,71,"Toronto, Canada",5

Arches National Park,A very unique national park that was on my bucket list. All of the arches are different sizes which you really can't appreciate unless you see them yourself.

Arches National Park,"This is such an amazingly beautiful place to visit. Went during the off-season, but had pretty great weather.Saw many of the stops along the way, and also had a chance to do a bit of walking and hiking. Did the regular and primitive trails at the Windows Arches area, walked to Landscape Arch, and did some smaller walks as well. All worth it, and the primitive trail around Windows and Turret arch was super fun.Everything is beautiful, and you will want to spend plenty of time here. You should give yourself at least a full day, if not more time.It is also very much worth coming back at night for stargazing. We went, and while we were the only car every place we stopped, we saw a few other cars driving by every once in a blue moon. It was definitely a bit creepy being out there in the vast darkness by ourselves, but the stars were AMAZING! It was like being in a planetarium, the way the sky and starts looked so close and wrapped around you. And you could so clearly see the Milky Way! We were also there during the Geminids Meteor Shower, so saw several ""shooting stars."" We did our first star gazing at Balanced Rock, and the rocks were darkly silhouetted in the background, and seemed to kind of come alive--really hard to describe, but it was so cool. Then we went to Panorama Point, which had slightly better stargazing and was, for me at least, a little less creepy-feeling.I highly recommend visiting this amazing National Park, and spending the whole day but also going back for some stargazing!","December 21, 2017",Seriously Amazing,14,Colorado,5

Sand Dune Arch was one of our favorite hikes. The next morning we hiked windows and double arch. Those were great as well. If you want to hike to Delicate Arch give yourself another day.

Note that its mostly uphill to see Delicate Arch (3 miles total) and the last part is along a ledge. There are no services inside the park once you pass the visitor center, so bring plenty of water & food. Most trails are exposed so bring a hat & sunscreen. Its high desert, so can be cool in the mornings & evenings but warms up during the day. If you go in peak season, start early to beat the crowds!

It was just me and one other person at the summit of the Delicate Arch trial! At most of the other arches I visited, I was the only one! Check the website for Arches National Park before you go. They have a graph showing the number of visitors by day over the year that was very helpful. During busy periods, there is literally NO PLACE TO PARK so you spend your time circling, not hiking and seeing the sights. The hike to the Double O arch is not for folks afraid of heights and exposure.Just do the 1 mile hike to the awesome Landscape arch and turn around.

Arches National Park,"I spent only two half days at Arches NP which is, of course, not enough to see everything but you can do a lot. The Windows Section is a good place to start, there are 2 short trails that take you to the Windows and Turret Arch on one side and the Double Arch on the other. You get very close, like, you can actually touch these Arches. I arrived around 3 pm and got to do all of this before 6, and there was enough time for short stops at Garden of Eden and Balanced Rock along the way. The next morning I went horseback riding outside the park (I highly recommend the Hauer Ranch to anyone who is interested) and then returned to Arches in the afternoon for the Delicate Arch hike. It takes about 45 min to an hour to get there and it is absolutely worth it! Here as well, you get very close and you can stand in the Arch for great photo opportunities. You’ll want to spend some time enjoying the view after you make the way there, so plan 2-3 h for the round trip. After that I had 1 hour left until the park closed (for road work, usually there is no time limit) which was enough for the short roundtrip to Landscape Arch. It is the largest Arch in the Park, but not the most scenic one and you only get to see it from a distance so I would do Delicate Arch first and this one only if there is time. If you go just a little beyond Landscape Arch, you get to a very interesting stretch of the trail towards Double O Arch, a rather steep uphill climb with a beautiful view from the top.Arches was my second stop on a trip that included several Parks, I had been to Rocky Mountain before where I bought a 2-day pass because I realized too late that I should have taken the annual Interagency Pass for $80 which is good for all National Parks for a year.

Arches National Park,This really is the most spectacular national park and fairly accessible for most as many of the views are just a few easy walks off a main carpark.

We only had two days in Arches when I could easily spend 3-4 days. From the very first stop (Park Ave.) to Double Arches (as seen in Indiana Jones & The Last Crusade), arches deep into the park, it was amazing and rivaled Canyonlands.

Arches National Park,Arches National Park is a must do for anyone even thinking about it. All of southern Utah’s parks are incredible but Arches has some of the best hikes and scenery that you will ever see.

Did a quick hike to the Delicate Arch - the trail is not well marked at points, and you may only know the path by seeing where others are going to/from (as well as some rocks/sticks occasionally arranged to point you in the right direction). The arch as well as the hike itself were both incredible, and I would highly recommend to anyone passing through.

The markers (rock cairns) were inconsistent. Sometimes I could see the next 5, other times I would start to wonder if I was off the trail. Twice I had some trouble seeing the next marker but got on the right path by waiting for someone coming from the other direction. My advice is to go in October-February if possible.

Arches National Park,"Arches National Park is like Sedona AZ on steroids! It is just breathtaking, no matter what direction you face there are amazing rock formations. Some of the ""arches"" take a little hiking to get to, and there are a couple that take a lot of hiking to get to - I didn't see those. The easy ones didn't have steep hills or rough terrain to deal with. Arches was completing re-surfacing all the roads in the park, putting in more turn outs for viewing/ picture taking and new picnic areas. The Arches National Park Visitors' Center has a great gift shop and they run a good introduction movie to the park every 30 minutes. It's well worth watching. Unless you're in a hurry to get some place else, this is a place to spend a couple days at so you can wander the paths & trails comfortably. Take time to go to Arches National Park's neighbor - Canyonlands. The Red Cliffs Lodge & Castle Creek Winery, on Hwy 128, just before the Arches turn off if coming from Moab, is worth a stop and a glass of wine. It is Utah's first winery. It also has a fascinating little museum - Moab Museum of Film & Western Heritage... movie Rio Grande with John Wayne filmed here - Thelma & Louise, Back to the Future lll, The Legend of the Lone Ranger (Johnny Depp as Tonto), 2001 A Space Odyssey is the short list for about 30+ films shot in the area. There is also another guest ""ranch"" a little further up the road that is definately 5 Star in every way...Sorrel River Ranch. Stop for a glass of wine/ drink/ beer in their bar to relax after the Arches.","November 20, 2017",Amazing. Breathtaking!,12,"Surprise, Arizona",5

We started our day with Delicate Arch - labeled as strenuous and glad we did it first. Another great reason to visit in October is that the amount of visitors is low.

Stop at the Visitor Center for the Junior Ranger Program and for an overview then head up the hill into the park. There are many arches that are easily accessible on short hikes and others that are worth taking longer strenuous hikes. The park is very close to Moab which is nice because there are no restaurants or lodging in the park which many other parks have. Early October was a little warm but we planned accordingly and brought plenty of water and snacks. We visited on a week day but I imagine weekends and holidays can be very busy.

Only it was a Friday when we visited so the signs should not have been there as many people did not read the fine print. It caused a lot of confusion. But we decided to not heed the sign and complete the delicate arch walk after 6 pm. There were a lot of people rushing back, causing a bit of a hazard due to the time signs.

Do check with the park's website or visitor centre.During high seasons especially, hotels in Moab (gateway to Arches) are expensive and if you have other destinations before/after Arches, you can explore more reasonably price hotels midways.

Then there are many hikes that are relatively flat with a bit of rock scrambling. Devils Garden provides a lot of choices. If you do not want to climb up the very steep rock trail just past the first Arch, you can walk back to where the trail splits and just walk the first mile or so of the primitive trail and then turn around.

Start early (I was on a bus tour and got here around 2 pm and got out by 7 pm) and have a plan on what to see based on your time. Start at the Visitor center, be sure you have adequate water (you can refill your water bottles at the Visitor Center and use the flush restrooms. You are limited to no flush outhouses at most of the sites). If you are hiking, be sure to check in and tell the rangers when you are leaving so they can at least start looking. Cell service is spotty at best and non existent most of the time.Plan on hiking from the parking lot (and it can get crowded with tour buses and cars) to most of the sandstone formations about 1/4 to 1/2 mile to and back. Stay on the paths. October and late September seems best based on temperature. WARNING: they want ""everyone out of the park by 7:00 pm"". If you decide to hike to see some formation and either ignore the time or lose track of it. Your parked car may be towed away. That can become ""nasty"" as you are now stranded and cell service is iffy in some areas of the park and hiking back to the closed down reception center in the dark is not an easy task.

Arches National Park,"Okay, the Park is beautiful. There are some easy trails and wonderful photo ops. BUT..... If you are going to hike up to Delicate Arch, be warned!! This is an extensive hike with steep inclines. If you are not ""fit"" you will huff and puff and feel like dying. If you have small kids that have to be carried, you will struggle. If you have kids that would rather play video games than go outside and play... They will complain non-stop. If you are elderly, or middle-aged (and unfit) like me, your knees will hurt for 3 days after. This is a hike where you will need 2-3 bottles of water PER PERSON going up AND coming down. When you make it to the top, you will feel rewarded with such a beautiful site! However, when you make it down... You'll feel blessed to have survived.","October 20, 2017",For Real....,8,"Georgetown, Texas",5

Arches National Park,We made our annual trek to Moab again this year and checked out Tower Arch for the first time. My daughter had issues and didn't want to take the longer walk back to the main parking lot so we walked back on the 4wd road to see if I could bring our 2012 Honda Pilot back to the 4wd parking lot.

We hiked 11 miles to visit 15 arches, and would offer that if you only had one day to visit any National Park, we would highly recommend Arches. Just north of the fun and funky town of Moab, Utah, Arches is an easily accessed gem of a National Park. The Visitor Center is a wonderful starting point to orient and determine your itinerary - we started at the popular Delicate Arch, hiked the full trail to the Double O arch complex and then worked our way back to all of the other spectacular side trips to see the park highlights. All of the arches are spectacles of nature and geology, so it's hard to rank them...but bring your camera so you can review after your day and then judge! Kudos to the National Park Service who are completing a great re-paving of all the park's roads and park amenities - future visitors will enjoy the well manicured roads and pullouts that enable easy travel within the park's boundaries.

Really the worst part is the slick rock and the first switch back in the beginning. If you want to see this beautiful icon and don’t feel you have it in you, take it from me as I didn’t think I had it in me either. Do it and take as much time as it takes.

Arches National Park,"My husband and I did a Mighty 5 National Park trip and although Zion was my #1 favorite Arches came in at #2 and is truly spectacular and amazing. We spent 3 days here total but I could have spent weeks exploring Moab and Arches NP. The park is very large and there is so much to enjoy and see. Unfortunately, the park can get quite busy mid day which can make parking at trailheads difficult and sometimes almost impossible as there is no bus system at this park. My advice is to get up and go super early to the park - hike the trails you want and then leave mid day when it starts to get too crowded. Then we would return in the evenings again when it wasn't busy. This also has the advantage of missing the hottest parts of the day. You can use the mid day to explore Moab, nap, eat, do excursions or even explore Canyonlands which is significantly less busy. Our favorite hikes were Devil's Garden and Delicate Arch. The Windows are great but get very busy since they are so close to the parking lot. Definitely take the entire drive through the park, even the views from the main road are amazing. Around 9-10pm come back to the park and drive back near Devil's Garden trailhead parking lot far away from the lights of Moab to stargaze.

Some friends have told me they prefer Canyonlands, but I don't understand why. Arches is much more compact and can be explored in a long and exhausting day. Most people want to see Delicate Arch from the iconic viewpoint that requires a serious hike, but I thought it was cool to see it from the other side (admittedly at a distance) that required very little walking. As for hiking, Devil's Garden is worth the 4.2 miles to Double Hole Arch, which also includes Landscape Arch. Beware: part of the trail requires traversing the ridge of a couple of ""fins"". You must pay attention and DO NOT STUMBLE, because the trail is about 4 feet wide with sheer drops on either side. Pretty dicey in the wind. Scared the crap out me.","October 12, 2017",Stunningly Awesome,68,"Seattle, WA",5

Arches National Park,"Everyone has a fantasy that a park will be all theirs when they visit and are disappointed when they encounter lines to get in, construction delays on the roads and other people on the trails. Here are my suggestions to make your visit more enjoyable:-Get advice from the rangers or at Welcome Centers. We stopped at Utah Welcome Center and was advised to visit Canyonlands and Dead Horse first and save Arches for the late afternoon. As we drove to Canyonlands early the next morning, there was already a long line to get into Arches. When we came back in the afternoon we drove right in.-Park passes are usually good for several days. If possible, try to stay a few days. Use one day to get an overview of the park then spend the next day or two focusing on specific sights and hikes-Smile at others at the sight or on the trail. Offer to take their picture. Sharing the experience of an amazing rock formation or scenic overlook makes it more memorable.The sermon is over!","October 12, 2017",Be realistic about your National Park expectations,129,"Baltimore, Maryland",4

We were not able to hike to the Balance Rock, as it being closed due to construction, but we were able to get great views and pictures! There is no places within the park to eat, so we took a cooler with lunch and lots of water. It took us all day to do all the easy trials, so if you only have a limited time, I'd pick the trails that you'd especially like to do and plan accordingly.

We had traveled from Bluff and hadn’t picked up lunch, the only food on offer was cereal bars or tail mixes, They really are missing a trick here. The roads and stopping places in the park area are great. It was a memorable day out.

Arches National Park,First off Arches is one of the most beautiful national parks I have visited. The road through the park is excellent and it offers many beautiful turnouts. The only downside is that many of the arches are best seen by hiking to them: #1 being Delicate Arch. I still wouldn't miss the park though if you can't or don't have time for hiking. My family still enjoyed seeing the many beautiful arches even if they were from a distance. Also try and get there earlier in the morning and I would say go to the Windows area first. This has limited parking and was bumper to bumper when we got there late morning.

Arches National Park,"The park costs $25 per vehicle for entry, and we spent most of our times that afternoon hiking to the Delicate Arch. That was because two of the sites along our way to the Arch was closed that day. It was about 45 minutes one way. About 1/3 the way there, the slope got stepper. Once you got over that steep part about 15 minutes depending on your physical condition, the rest got easy again. The Delicate Arch came into view and looked wonderful. Some folks hiked down below the Arch for a better view pointing their camera up. Although the sign said everyone should leave the park before 7PM; a large number of people started their hike up to the Arches after 6:30PM that day. If you do want to stay late, I would recommend bringing head lamp or torch light for seeing your way down after sunset.","October 9, 2017",A 45-minute hike to the Delicate Arch,81,"Chicago, Illinois",4

Most involved some type of hike, from a short, easy 1/2 mile, to 2-3 miles. The best Arch was easily the Double arch which happens to be on a short easy path. Simply spectacular!

Also where possible some crawling around on boulders but we respect the park and stay on the path when required. In town they suggested getting there early as there is a long line after 9:00 when they start checking passes. We have park passes so we weren't avoiding the fees. And just to get a parking spot at some of the hikes you want to arrive before 8:00. I will say that if you do Park Avenue hike, plan to do it late morning or in the afternoon for the best light on that area but plan to do it.

Arches National Park,"We got there at 7:30 am September 13, although 7am might have been even better especially in the summer. There's no one working at the entrance at that time so you drive right in for free. We skipped the Delicate Arch because we read that you have to walk along the edge of a cliff with no handrail and went right to the Windows Section. We walked right up to one arch and got close enough for some nice pictures of the other ones. Then we went to Landscape Arch and there were still plenty of parking places. It's about a mile hike to the Lanscape Arch, mostly easy but there's one sort of steep hill, not to worry nothing at all like the hills in Zion Park. Once you get close to Landscape Arch you will begin to see it with no sky under it. As you get closer you begin to see it with sky below it. The last 100 feet of the trail is a little difficult. The best way I can describe it is a pile of rocks that you can't walk around and have to go over if you want to get to the end of the trail for a view of the arch with the most sky under it. Walking sticks aren't going to help you get through those rocks. I saw people turn back at that point and someone go over on their hands and knees. It's not at all scary, but it all depends on your balance. Good balance and it's very, very easy. We went back from there but there is another arch another mile down the trail. There was a little sub-trail on the way back where we saw a couple less impressive arches. The parking lot was full there by the time we got back to our car. Then we stopped at the Fiery Furnace viewpoint and managed to get a parking place. It was around noon when we left the park and the line of cars was incredibly long trying to get in. Our visit went very smoothly.

While I only asked why some of the rocks have a green tint to them, he shared that and more, including:⁃ the redness in the rocks is caused by oxidation, and that the red is from Manganese and Iron⁃ the green in the rock is iron, reduced... the iron gets or loses an electron as water flows through it, changing its colorThank you, Ranger.All - go visit Arches National Park, and plan at least 3-4 hours.","October 4, 2017",WOW - what a beautiful part of the American desert!,75,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5

Arches National Park,"We arrived early at the National Park and headed straight up to the Devils Garden Trailhead so that we would be able to park. At that time it was fine but later in the day it would be a bit hit and miss if you could get a parking place. We first walked to the Landscape arch and then onto the double arch, that took about 2hours with a lot of climbing over rocks etc. The views where fantastic on the way and it was fascinating seeing the double arch at the end of it, unless you are fairly fit I would say it would be a struggle for some people but worth it in the end. From there we made our way back through the Arches NP and stopped off at the various view points at different Arches and Rock Formations. We where lucky with the parking and managed to get in every one we stopped at. Well worth going to even if you just stop at the viewpoints on the roadside and not do a lot of walking to the various arches which where further away.","October 4, 2017",Arches National Park,39,"Beverley, United Kingdom",4
Arches National Park,"Lots of Arches and each has it's own character. DELICATE ARCH is the main attraction. The hike is considered ""Difficult"" which is justified. The round trip hike is 3 miles with approx. 450 ft of elevation gain. You should try this hike to the amazing ""free standing"" arch. This arch is displayed on Utah license plates.LANDSCAPE ARCH has the longest span in the world. The hike is a rather easy and picturesque 1.8 mile round trip. Two additional arches, both of which are impressive, can be viewed by taking a short side trail from this trail head.WINDOWS & DOUBLE ARCHES both have unique features making them favorites. These 2 arches start from the same parking lot with the trails in opposite directions. Both arches have easy, short trails from the parking lot. Both arches allow climbing directly underneath the span. There are several additional arches which are on less crowded trails. Some are on easy trails others require longer hikes or more difficult trails. We were surprised that every ""arch we hiked to had features different from those we had already seen.BALANCED ROCK is also a ""Must See"". You will see it from the road and can pull off into the parking lot for a few quick pictures. This free standing 129 ft tall pillar requires only a 0.3 mile easy round trip hike to its base. Standing adjacent to the base of this monolith is an absolute must!Be aware that you may have backups to check into the park, especially from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM and over weekends. Road resurfacing is ongoing during the week after 7:00 PM. You may encounter one lane sections on the road or pulloffs/parking areas unavailable because of parked construction equipment.The Bottom Line: Put this park on your ""Bucket List""!","October 3, 2017",Amazing!

The closer to Moab the more beautiful the scenery. This road has to be part of the trip. One day spent in Arches but could have been 2 or more especially if you are into bikes or hiking. The Arches are incredible! Pictures do not do this park justice. Third day was spent in Canyonlands National Park at the North end called Island in the Sky. They are close together and as implied you are on top of the mountain by car. If you want to hike you can get even higher. Not really fall colors but some color change taking place.

So many people, but few parking spaces, especially for motorhomes. They need more restrooms, too. I really wouldn’t even consider driving a truck and trailer, though it is allowed. How they got through tight parking lots with other rv’s sticking out is beyond me.

When you enter the park, you drive the road in, there are 2 side branch roads, but at the end of the main road, you just turn around and come back out the same way you went in. They are working on the roads, which causes some additional congestion and closures (7PM - 7AM), but even with the road improvements, there is a high volume of traffic and people.We waited until later in the day, about 4PM, and at least there was no line waiting to enter the park.I would recommend going to Dead Horse State Park, or better yet, the Canyonlands, both of which are in the same area.","October 2, 2017",Overrated tourist attraction,13,"Bear, Delaware",3

We skipped the windows section and headed to the other places after Delicate Arch, I would recommend making the Windows section a priority, I found that area to be the most impressive.

There is drinking water and toilets available at the main sites. I'm pretty sure there are no food outlet in the park so take a packed lunch and drink plenty of water.My only criticism was the number of booths open at the entrance.

Arches National Park,"Almost all of Arches can be seen from your car or a short walk on maintained walkways. This is both an asset and debit. Having the spectacular natural arches easily accessible is great but leads to overcrowding. There is only one road through the park and no chance to pass slow vehicles. RVs and tour buses will stack cars behind them so be prepared for a slow travel. It will take an hour or more to travel from the entrance to the back of the park. Avoid the worst of the traffic and crowds by arriving early. Peak times in the park are from 9am to 3pm. There are three longer must do hikes in the park which are on primitive trails. Warning, don' go on these trails unless you are in good physical shape, have experience in hiking, have good hiking shoes, and take lots of water. This is the dessert and dehydration is a real risk.

Arches National Park,We did so many trails in Arches and saw so many beautiful rock formations. Delicate Arch is a tough trail but worth it for the amazing view at the end. Double arch was magnificent and the paragraph of elephants was a double bonus. Only negative about the park is the number of visitors that want to continually yell at each other and stay in little mobs. That makes it a bit frustrating at times. I asked one couple if they could be a bit quieter and they kindly apologized and dropped their conversation a couple octaves.

This park allows you to see naturally-occurring rock formations, even if you do not leave your car. Although, I suggest at least taking the short 0.9 mile jaunt to landscape arch. The park allows for short walks or longer hikes to see the arches, while some can also be seen from the car.

Best advice is get there as early as you can and be done by noon. This is what we did and that way avoided the crowds. I'm hoping we can come back again soon.

Arches National Park,"The Park is very well organized with perfect paved roads, and places to stop and adore the great, stunning arches, and other rock formations. When you plan in your mind, what will you see, it's a disappointment when it isn't available. The trail to the Balancing Rock was closed, but from the road, it was visible, so it wasn't too bad. The trail to the Delicate Arch is 3 km, and since you have to go back as well, it's already 6 km. Because we arrived in the afternoon, and the park closes at 7 o'clock, we didn't have time for this 6 km hike, and the road that we wanted to use to approach this arch, was closed because it was overflooded. I comforted myself with the thought that I would at least buy a fridge magnet in the souvenir shop that depicts Delicate Arch. I was wrong. The gift shop closed at 4:00. With other disappointed guests, we were blaming the bad management who closed the gift shop three hours before closing the park.Besides, we were not lucky anyway, since the sky was cloudy, and it was a windy, rainy weather. Of course, when we started out, the sun was shining immediately. It was just that kind of day.","September 24, 2017",The road to Delicate Arch was closed,1331,"Sydney, Australia",4

Arches National Park,"This is a great park for a scenic drive, and when you get to an attraction you can park and do a little walking to get closer, or even get inside some of the arches. The attractions are mostly rock formations carved by the wind which form, as you might expect, arches. This would make for a very nice half-day to day depending on how much you want to get into. We did experience a thunderstorm, and when we saw it coming we went for the car to leave. Along the way, we saw what a flash flood does in this environment. Since it is all rock, none of the water can soak in anywhere, so it all rushes out as a flash flood, and carries mud and small rocks with it.

We found that the only way to enjoy the park without a ton of people and lack of parking (We couldn't even go to Devil's Garden since there was no place to park.) was to arrive as soon as the park opened which was 7 when we visited.

We eventually found a facility (whew!) - but could not find a parking space so we could eat our lunch! Driving around some more, we finally were able to park and eat in our car - no picnic tables or covers of any sort to get a break from the sun. Luckily there was a breeze and it was only low 80s on this pretty Monday in mid-September. Not sure how people with kids could do this in the heat of the summer with even more visitors!

There was construction in the park on the day I visited, some closures and big crowds but it's so big and grand, the visiting crowds feel miniscule.A side note, get gas in Moab or before you exit the interstate. I entered the park with more than a quarter tank, but driving slowly and running my AC on high, frequent stops and starts to take photos or a short hike used enough gas that I wanted to fill up. North of the park at the entrance ramps to the Interstate is a small gas station with 2 pumps and they charge DOUBLE what the next closest station charges!

Arches National Park,"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the beautiful vistas and cool rock formations. We found the hike to Delicate Arch was a good, but a little tough hike, but if you are hiking with older/younger family members, I would really recommend the Broken Arch hike, because it was much flatter and easier for all fitness levels. Plus it was stunning! No food or water for sale in the park so definitely it pays to plan ahead and bring a cooler.

Take the 3 hours to hike to Delicate Arch, the view is breathtaking and the sense of accomplishment will do your soul good. All of the major attractions are easily reached by car, and the more adventurous will find plenty of moderate trails to satisfy themselves. Arrive early (0730) to avoid crowds and the heat. On your trip in bypass everything and go directly to Delicate Arch to avoid the crowds. Take the rest of your time and work back out of the park. We found two days as the minimum time to see 75% of the park.","September 19, 2017",Epic views,2,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5

Arches is one of the most beautiful areas in the U.S. There IS a lot of traffic and some road construction, but when you get into the park, it's remarkably uncrowded. Take some time and do some short hikes to get the best views. Remember to take water! It gets very hot, even on short hikes. In a half day we saw Delicate Arch (1 ml hike to upper viewpoint); Pothole, Double, Turret, Tapestry, Skyline, Tunnel and Pine Tree (latter 2 w/ another 1 mile+ hike).

To see Delicate Arch you must walk the 3 mile trail because the road to both upper and lower views is flooded. The trail not for 70+ seniors with knee problems although we tried.

Arches National Park,"We liked the other national parks in the area even better than this one, but this is the one your friends and family will have heard about -- and its attractions justify its fame. The tip we had, which we strongly endorse, is to do the hike to the Delicate Arch as soon after the park opens as you can. Even though we were there on a weekday, albeit the Friday before Labor Day, the trail was crowded and the parking lot almost full by the time we finished. We started about 7:10am and finished about 9:30am. The other sites had more space relative to their popularity, and offered easier hikes, so could be done in the busier and hotter times of the day.","September 17, 2017",Best-Known National Park in the Area,15,"Austin, Texas",5
Arches National Park,"We came here on a Friday morning (entered at 08:00) and the entrance gate was unattended so people didn't pay the entrance fee (we have the ""America the Beautiful"" Pass). They open the visitor information centre at 09:00 so I imagine they start charging at the gate at a similar time.Normally entrance costs $25 for a private vehicle, $15 for a motorcycle, and $10 per person (walk-in / bicycle). When you enter early you enjoy the extraordinary colours provided by the early morning sun rays, as well as less busy roads.The park itself has numerous attractions with our top two being the ""Delicate Arch"" and the ""Double Arch"". The first one requires a 30-45 minutes walk (each way) but is absolutely worth it. The odd thing was that we arrived at the arch at 12:15pm and were the fourth to visit it that day. This meant we pretty much had the place to ourselves. The double arch is always busy and requires only a 3-5 minutes walk to reach it.Overall, I would recommend spending a full day here, or even spreading it over two days.No to be missed!","September 17, 2017",Spectacular!

Arches National Park,"We came to Moab to hike and visit Arches National Park. But, driving in, I noticed that park information was available on a radio station. After tuning in, I discovered that the park was under construction. The construction would be done when the park was closed - which currently happened each night SUNDAY through THURSDAY. At 7:00 pm each night visitors were required to be out of the park! Relieved that we would be there in Friday night and Saturday, it was short lived, because they had advice for those visitors, too. Because of the volume of visitors, the Park officials recommended that drivers NOT attempt to visit the park IF the lines were backed up to Highway 191 already - to simply return at another time that was not as busy. They also advised that the park would close IF there were too many visitors at on time- opening as allowable! The Balanced Rock site was currently closed. Now granted, I am sure this was all communicated by the National Park Service on their website. But, having visited the park regularly, I had not gone to the website, so it caught me off-guard. Arriving in Moab - we found that it was indeed high season - RV parks and restaurants were booked solid for the weekend- and would continue to be until the end of October. We chose to do a hike along the River Canyon (fantastic - and not overcrowded!) - and to visit Arches National Park for sunset. It was the perfect choice - vivid colors, relatively few visitors - and the entrance fee was free (about 7 pm!) It was another fabulous visit - but we will return - when the construction is done!!!","September 16, 2017",Under construction! ,92,"Grand Junction, Colorado",5

I hiked the 2 miles roundtrip to see some Arches but passed on a couple other. Be sure and bring sun block and water. Some smaller arches required less of a walk and were nice. I suggest if you are driving go all the way into the farthest point and work your way out. If you stop at everyone on the way in you will maybe get to tired to make the long hike. This way as you drive out you can cool down, drink water, relax to get ready for next stop and hike...Then you can skip some if you are tired...........wish I had done a 4X4 guided of road tour...check with your hotel and see if they have tour group.....tried on line but ran into jerks....","September 15, 2017",Wear comfortable clothes,34,"Kansas City, Missouri",3

Best time to go is spring or fall (October is perfect). A guided tour in the Fiery Furnace is amazing (book in advance).

Make sure you fill your water bottles at the visitor center. Watch your footing and be careful on hikes. Plan to spend a whole day.

We didn't encounter any delays at the park entrance, so maybe September is a good time to visit. There were lots of people at most of the attractions and parking was sometimes an issue though.

But beware: The weather can be very hot (over 100 degrees F) with little shade, so bring lots of water. Also, wear sunscreen, a hat and decent walking shoes. We saw so many people with sunburn sliding around the rocks wearing flimsy flip-flops. Not smart!Try to get to the park early in the morning or in the evening, to avoid the heat and the crowds.

Was very hot and dry so we drove in predawn and hiked early both days returned to hotel and came back late to hike in the evening. Carry water and have cold water in the car. Many short walks and all are interesting. Surprised the entrance booth was never manned, trash cans overflowing, ands signs everywhere about restrictions/closures due to paving with threatened car towing yet when we asked Park Rangers they said to disregard ""all those signs"".","September 13, 2017",Arches National Park,18,"Johnson City, Tennessee",4

Arches National Park,"An amazing place that I equate with Dr. Seuss doing his thing with rocks. How many places on earth have such incredible, free standing rock formations that at times defy description? One of my all time favorite national parks.We were subjected to the current road construction program at our visit in August. At a minimum, the park closes early and you are forced to exit the park...no ifs, ands, or buts, about it. If you are visiting in the near future, please make sure to check the website to see what limitations will be enforced. We were not able to hike to delicate arch so please do your homework.It is an easy drive through the park with fairly generous parking spaces. No cliffs of death to worry about. Just keep in mind that it gets really hot here. The sun is intense with big, big blue skies, so attention to sunscreen is a must. It was very hot and windy during our visit in August so bring water.This is a fee park, and has high visitation. We waited in line for almost 20 minutes to get through the ranger gate. If you can come early, do so to avoid the crowds. The visitor center is big and informative. Lots of rangers around to answer questions and direct your interests.Not sure I can say any thing more that has not already been said other than the fact that if you want to know what really sets our country apart from the rest of the world, in terms of natural beauty, this may be the poster child for such claims. Do yourself a favor and visit. Simply a magical place. If you are limited in time, you can easily see the majority of the good views in 3 hrs. if you just do the drive and view points.","September 12, 2017",Check the website for Road Improvement Construction & Restrictions,196,"Havre de Grace, Maryland",5

Arches National Park,This was an amazing thing to behold and a definite place to visit if you go through Moab or like national parks. You can't see everything it has to offer in one visit because of the time it takes for the hikes and the heat of the day will get to you very quickly so it's best to go in the early morning or late afternoon. If you go after 5 they won't charge you since you have to be out by 6:45 but that will just tease you and make you come back for more the next day and it costs 25.00 which is good for one week with your receipt ,"September 11, 2017",An Amazing Journey,15,Missouri,5

Arches National Park,"This National Park should be on everyone's bucket list. It is truly spectacular. Before you go visit the NPS web site to check out the current condition and any alerts or road construction. Also plan your time while in the park. Make sure that you do visit the Visitors Center to discover the history and geology of the Park plus maybe book a Ranger guided hike.There is so much to do in this park, the big question is what to see & do first. I would start early and hike to Delicate Arch, as it gets quite crowded later in the day and can be hard to find a park. Other must sees are Windows and Double Arch, also Devils Garden and the walk to Landscape and Double O Arch. This is just the start, as the Park has over 2,000 natural arches plus numerous rock formations. If you have time book the Ranger led hike of the Fiery Furnace. This is a park where you will want more than 1 day to really see and appreciate everything that it has to offer.The NPS has done a great job with explanatory signs located in pull-offs right throughout the park. The trails are well maintained and contain markers the more remote trails. There are plenty of restrooms at the most popular places. It can get extremely hot, so take plenty of water with you and always carry it on the trails.Other popular spots in the Park include Balanced Rock, Park Avenue and Broken or Sand Dune Arch.One NP that you really do have to see.","September 10, 2017",One of the most beautiful National Parks in the US,236,"Fairfax, Virginia",5

Arches National Park,"Having first visited Arches in 1974, this is one of the places I must re-visit whenever in the area. The formations, the landscape, is almost surreal. If you have the time, the best hike is to the iconic Delicate Arch, the one portrayed on Utah license plates. Also recommended is reading the novel ""The Monkey Wrench Gang"" by Edward Abbey, who once worked at Arches. Or, if you have a more philosophical bent, read ""Desert Solitaire,"" also by Abbey. Both are actually essential reading for anyone visiting the Moab area.","September 8, 2017",Pilgrimage!,76,Virginia,5
Arches National Park,Arriving early to mid afternoon avoids most of the traffic. You must leave the park by 7 pm loosely enforced. But if you want good pictures do not arrive too late as the peaks and arches get shaded and pictures become too dark. There is a lot of roads in the park and while we were there 2.5 hrs I would have liked to have more time. I think 4 hrs would be the minimum if you want to see everything. There are lots of pull off points and trails to walk. You can see almost everything without a lot of walking if that is a problem. Well worth the visit even if you never get out of the car.

Arches National Park,"It seems most visitors to Arches just do the drive in, a couple of short strolls and the drive out, which is a shame. The Fiery Furnace hike is one of the most enjoyable hiking experiences imaginable. Contrary to what some sites say, you do NOT need to go on a range led hike, but you DO need a permit, and to get one you need to watch a short video and listen to an orientation from a ranger at the visitors center. There IS a marked route, but there are places where the arrows can be tricky to spot and getting lost is certainly possible. You are free to venture off the marked route and explore as long as you follow the rules which are intended to protect the fragile environment. We did a lot of off-route exploring and it was a blast.

You can see pretty much everything in half a day at the park if you're on a tight schedule. You won't be disappointed! When the weather is cooler there are some very nice hikes about an hour and half one way to see Delicate Arch (the one in the postcards and on the Utah state license plate). As you are driving through the park, MAKE SURE you stop and walk up to SANDSTONE ARCH. It's just a VERY short distance from the road and VERY interesting to see.

Arches National Park,"I recently went to Arches National Park with my wife for two days and we were able to see everything that we wanted to see within those two days. Also to note that we did not stay the entire day at the park but were able to see almost everything. Below is the itinerary we followed to enjoy the most of what Arches has to offer. Day 1: Arrived to Arches in the afternoon because we drove straight from northern Utah. We headed straight to the delicate Arch. The afternoon was a perfect time to find parking and not be too crowded on the trail. The down side is that it is high 90s in August, so it was hot. Make sure to pack at least two liters a person for this hike. If you struggle with walking, then this hike is not for you. Delicate Arch trail is a difficult hike, but is well worth the climb to get close enough to touch the delicate Arch. The hike takes about two to three hours to do. After we hiked delicate arch, we left the park for the day because we were tried. There is bathrooms at the delicate arch, but no access to water. Day 2: Got to the park mid morning and headed straight to Landscape arch which is about a 30 minute drive from the entrance of the park. There is plenty of parking here, access to water and bathrooms. The hike to landscape arch is not that difficult. Along the trail, there are two other Arches to see. This hike takes about 1.5 to do. Again make sure to have more than enough water. After landscape arch, we saw some Arches along the way back to the broken arch and tapestry Arch. The hike to the broken arch is fairly easy. If you are looking for an adventure, I recommend going beyond broken arch to the tapestry arch. The trail to this arch is sandy and rocky at certain points. To do both of these Arches, plan a few hours to hike them. When we did tapasey arch, we were the only one on the trail which was lonely and awesome at the same time. We concluded our day at 4pm. I recommend that you pack a water jug or a cooler full of water bottles so you have plenty of water to last you the entire day. Also pack sunscreen, snacks, hats, and sunglasses. Arches is an awesome park to get outside and enjoy the red rocks. ","September 4, 2017",Two Day Plan to see most of Arches,76,"Clearfield, Utah",5

We arrived by 7am on the 2nd day so that we could hike all the Devil's Garden. Area. This was awesome! We were thankful to start very early to beat the heat. We were done by 1pm. We took the regular path all the way to Dark Angel, but we returned by the primitive trail. At many points on the primitive trail, we were by ourselves with all of nature surrounding us. Make sure you have plenty of water if you do this trail, since it is over 7 miles. This trail allows you to get up close & personal with many arches and the desert. Beware, this trail isn't for young children or people afraid of heights. One note: we were disappointed that paving is currently happening at Arches & so the park closes at 7pm Mon-Thursday. Additionally, you are unable to go into ""The Windows Section"" of the park. I am sure as they move forward with paving, this portion will reopen, but other areas will likely close. There were signs saying that paving will continue throughout 2018. ","September 2, 2017","Beautiful, but busy park!",11,"Hurricane, Utah",4

The trails are well maintained. The views are incredible. The only thing I did not like was they close the trail head parking lots at 7 pm. Really limits you on some sunset hikes. Bring water lots of it there are only two places to refill basically 40 minutes apart.For us the two must do hikes was Windows and Delicate arch.

All along the way people on their return hike kept telling us ""it is worth It"", so we continued on our journey. They were right, it is beautiful. A few pictures and soaking in the beauty of the park and we headed back. The downhill return hike was much easier especially with a sense of accomplishment.

Arches National Park,"Arches National Park is wonderful but also relatively small and very popular which leads to a lot of crowding. Also located in a hot desert area, temperatures can get uncomfortably, even dangerously hot, in the spring, summer and fall.However, do not let these difficulties prevent you from visiting this unique wonderland; the trick is to arrive early. In 2017, due to overnight road construction, this means as close to opening at 7am as possible most mornings by staying in Moab just a few miles south of the park.If you plan to hike to Delicate Arch, head directly to the trailhead as the hike involves a long, fairly strenuous climb up exposed slickrock that is not too bad in the cool desert mornings plus the parking lot at the trailhead can fill as early as 9am or so.If you are not up for a strenuous hike, or on a second morning, upon entering the park, visit the Windows section of the park which is best in the morning (assuming it has reopened) then head to the Devils Garden Trailhead, at the very end of the park’s scenic road, arriving by 10am to avoid a full lot, and hike to Landscape Arch, the longest arch in the park, which is best lit in midmorning.Most of the other better park features are close to the road and best lit in the afternoon so series of quick stops, even in the afternoon heat, is appropriate for these.","August 31, 2017",Go Early to Beat the Heat and the Crowds,3757,"Avon, Ohio",5

Since we are not the hiking type, I used a bigger lens on the camera instead. It was my understanding from prior reviews that you could drive near the arches; I guess there definition of near differs from ours. We spoke with some people later on in our trip that took several of the hikes. He said there is a lot more to see if you are willing to walk to them. While I understand it is a natural park and not man-made, I feel their advertising is a little off.

The Delicate Arch hike is very worthwhile and people were taking turns for photos at the arch itself, which I thought was civilized. Still, it was difficult, if not, impossible to take a photo of the arch without anyone in the photo. I don't enjoy hiking with that many people so we made a quick visit. We did not do the other hikes. We drove up to the Gardens area and the parking lot was almost full at that point (this is at 8:30 in the morning).

I hiked to Delicate Arch, Wolfe Ranch trail (took about 4 hours, including rests and just being at the top). People were awesome at allowing each other photo time (we stood in line to get under the Arch) and taking photos for others. The shorter version was still a little trek and offers a view from a distance.Balanced Rock Trail was an fairly easy circle around the structure.Sand Dune and Broken Arch are in the same area and both are worth the hike. Sand Dune has one larger rock to get over to see the arch.

It appeared that only one line had formed but when the park was opened, they let two lines go in. I would recommend forming a second line if there is only one line formed. Then, the attendants waved all the cars through without checking for national park passes or requesting payment, evidently to avoid congestion. The first thing that we did was to hike to Delicate Arch which took us 2.5 hours total trip. Best to do it first thing in the morning before the temperature soared.

But you should know that it might not be a good idea if you are afraid of heights or if you have children with you. This trail (after landscape arch) is not paved anymore and will take you on several ledges that gives you an amazing view. You might have to climb a bit and use your hands (not too much but still) There are places where it can be dangerous to fall (so that is why it might be not such a good idea for children)But still, this was very cool !! We really enjoyed it.Please note that we went the week of August 24th and the road to window section, the campground and the road to delicate arch was closed due to road work. If you plan to go to Arches soon take a look at the website to see what is closed and what is open...

This is the wild, there are no fences or guides to tell you when you are doing something dumb (like allowing your child to walk over an arch that has signs clearly asking you not to do so). It should be protected for all to enjoy in the years to come. Arches unfortunately suffers from a throng of road warrior tourists who rarely look to get off the beaten path.

It is said there are over 2000 arches at this park. We did a drive through tour and were able to see Delicate Arch in the distance (the most famous photographed arch) We also walked to another arch area and saw a couple more arches from the road. The park was more beautiful than we imagined and we would love to be able to return to see more of the park in the future. Allow more time than we did.

Arches National Park,"Spend the time to go to the visitor info in Moab. They gave us maps and told us the best arches to see and when. Some are better in the morning and others better in the afternoon. There is lots of hiking to get to some arches-visitor info will tell you. Go early in the morning when the park opens as we saw large lineups at the gate later in the morning. Wear good shoes, and lots of water. Shade is limited and it can get very hot.

One complaint is people need to read the restrictions posted like no pets on trails, don't deface the property or how about parking in designated spots.

Arches National Park,"There is a reason that Arches is probably the most photographed/published national park! You cannot help but be in awe at the natural wonders. Very drive-able along the main road (and there are some moderate dirt roads as well, for AWD and stock 4x4; along with some other hard-core 4x4 routes for the jacked up beasts). Show up EARLY; the park gets real busy around 9 or 10 am. Fill up your water jugs at the visitor center from filtered filling stations.The arches are crowded, so you may not be able to get those perfect nature shots during peak season. Please wear real hiking shoes/boots, long pants and long sleeves for sun protection, hats. And pack plenty of water, even for the short hikes. You are high altitude, and dehydrate quickly from sun/wind.Pack a short rope as well, since some of the moderate hikes may involve going up/down some slickrock paths, and sometimes the person below you could use a little help.As with all National Parks, there is a per car entrance fee or show your national parks membership pass.","August 24, 2017",Awesome views,100,"Los Angeles, California",5

It was very warm, over 95 degrees, and when we went to the Visitors Centre in Moab they advised us to go very early in the morning and take plenty of water and sunscreen. So we arrived at 7.30 to avoid the queues that form there every day, and because of the heat we were glad we did. We managed to walk to all the arches we wanted to go and see, exhausting but worth it. However by 1.30 it was getting very hot so we decided to leave the park and go out and eat somewhere nice and cool. There was a road closure, also the park did close early that day so we couldn't see the sunset there, but we went to Dead Horse Point instead, which was beautiful and peaceful.

Arches National Park,"My daughter and I have wanted to go to Arches NP for quite some time. We decided that it was worth the 6.5 hour drive from Vegas to Moab. We arrived at opening 7 am) which I would highly recommend. If you get there after 10 the entry gets fairly backed up. Additionally, it is one long road (with a few pull offs) so if you get stuck in the entry line, you may become frustrated with the slow pace through the park.We saw delicate arch first from the upper viewing which states a moderate hike. I would say that was generous. We did not hike to the arch itself because my daughter's asthma was bothering her. All in all if you aren't planning on hiking to the delicate arch skip this stop. There are many more arches with easier access. The delicate arch road is a good distance from the main drag so it is somewhat time consuming if you are on a tight time frame. Irregardless, Arches NP is beautiful. I would definitely recommend wearing appropriate footwear and bringing water. Also, plan on spending a good portion of your day there. If I had it to do again, I would go to the park from 7 to 10 am. Then go back to the hotel to swim or hit downtown Moab for some shopping and lunch until 3 and return to the park from 3 to closing.","August 23, 2017",Breathtaking Views,8,"Boston, United States",5

The Windows section was closed but everything else was open and the weather was great. We took a ton of photos and are still marveling at the natural beauty of this place.

Arches National Park,"Note: I'm writing this from the perspective of someone with some mobility (knee) issues. I cannot do the strenuous hikes that require scrambling up and down rocks.Gorgeous park with spectacular geological features.BUT - Make sure to prepare well before coming to Arches: bring plenty of water (at least 2 quarts/liters per person), food to last you the entire day, and dress for hiking in heat (90+ degrees in blazing sun). There are no water fill up stations or flush toilets beyond the Visitor's Center. The Visitor's Center sells only trail mix - no real food services at all. All other toilets are National Park standard-issue port-o-potties, which are not quite as hideous as others you might have experienced, but still. They are what they are. Most of them are well stocked with toilet paper and hand sanitizer.Also note: Arches is at about 4K feet above sea level. Keep that in mind, if you feel that you're having a harder time than usual walking uphill or catching your breath.Good news:(1) you can drive the entire loop, stop whenever you want to stop to get out and look at many awesome overlooks. One of the most famous stops is Balanced Rock - which is easily accessible. Another nice one is Fiery Furnace.(2) The walk to Landscape Arch is relatively easy - mostly paved, but roller-coaster steep in short bursts. But, I never made all the way to the end to the Double-O arch due to the change from paved surface to sand. After 45 minutes walking in the heat and sun, that was just too much. My husband went on without me and could not find the Double-O. Not sure what he did wrong.(3) We took the one Ranger walk from Courthouse Wash. It was relatively easy (i.e. I was able to do it) and very interesting. (4) The one Ranger program at 7:00 p.m. at the Visitor's Center was also very interesting.Bad news: (1) the park is working on the park roads, so Sunday through Thursday the park is closed after 7:00 p.m. and the section with the Windows arches and the ""Garden of Eden"" is completely closed off. (2) access to the most famous/iconic arch (Delicate Arch) is limited. The trail to Delicate arch is extremely difficult - the rangers told us that so far this year (2017) 5 people have died in the park; weirdly, most of them having to do with this trail: 2 people had heart attacks; 2 people went off trail, got lost, and died of heat exhaustion/stroke; 1 person fell off the ledge along the trail. (3) the two other easier trails are have viewpoints that are so far away, it's almost not worth it to do the harder hike to the upper view point.(4) Ranger programs are limited There was only 1 Ranger walk (Courthouse Wash) and 1 Ranger talk (7 p.m. at the Visitor Center).We visited 5 National Parks this summer (Grand Canyon, Arches, Canyonlands, Bryce Canyon, and Zion). Arches was my least favorite. Doesn't mean it's not spectacular - just that for someone with my limitations, it was the least enjoyable.","August 22, 2017",Come prepared - no services and most iconic arches are hard to get to,5,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",4

We went all the way to the top and worked our way back over the course of the day. There were plenty of spots to park the RV because of the current roadwork in the park. We visited on a Saturday, no construction crews were working, it was the perfect time to visit.

Arches National Park,"This is a government run shop... and government run things don't have to win customers, don't have to improve, don't have to worry about service, competition, business, etc. Let's face it: the folks there would probably be happier if NO ONE came. Their salaries are the same regardless of visitors, and it's less work. Yes- I'm cynical on government. So why the complaint? Because more than half the park was closed, but the price of admission was the same. I understand you need to fix roads, but we planned this trip a while ago. And when you take away half the hikes, you should do something more than put up a sigh ""road closed"". You should charge less for the entry fee. Or the park rangers should sing me a song. Something. That's just annoying. But, like I said, it's government run. Their incentives are not aligned to the customers' experience. Not saying some park rangers don't love their job and love the park. They do. But the business of the Park is not a well run business.","August 22, 2017",I'm taking away a star for service...,224,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",4

Arches National Park,"We had one day to travel around Arches National Park. Park entrance fee is $25. We stopped at the Visitors Center. It has bathrooms and places to get water. You can learn about the rock formations and how arches form before heading to the actual arches. There are many arches to hike to and some that you can view from the road. We only had one day so we picked a few to go see:Fiery Furnace Scenic Overlook: Short walk from the parking lot. It was beautiful. There is a tour available for this area but it is long and needs to be booked early. A guide must take you along this hike. Balanced Rock: A short hike to view Balanced Rock from all sides. It is easily viewed from the road or parking lot. Park Avenue: Amazing walk along an old river bed with a solid red rock base. It is surrounded by beautiful red cliffs. It is a great walk beginning with a set of rock stair s and along the way a few things to climb or step over. It is just amazing! The hike really just goes from one parking lot to another so we hiked about 3/4 of the way to the opposite parking lot and then headed back. Don't skip this one.Broken Arch is an easy 1.5 mile loop to hike. It is just amazing how big the arch is and how narrow the sides are. Sand Dune Arch is on the same beginning trail as Broken Arch. This one has a narrow passage to walk through but amazing to experience. It really has sand and kids were playing in it with a bucket and shovel. The sand has a pink hue. Skyline Arch: you can view from your car or it is a simple- less than a 1/4 of a mile walk to see. Not as amazing as the others, but an arch that can be appreciated from your car.Double Arch: DO NOT MISS THIS ONE. It was amazing. It is a short hike from where you park. Parking was very crowded but we easily found a spot off the side of the road. Not a long hike from the first parking lot but a little bit of a climb if you want to go inside the arches. Is was beautiful!Windows: Same parking as the Double Arch, just hike in the other direction. We did not hike to see them, we just appreciated them from the parking lot at the Double Arches.The road to Delicate Arch was closed the day we were there for road repair but I would loved to have hiked there as well.Landscape arch is the longest arch at the park and is an amazing must see as well. There are probably many others but that is all that we really had time to catch before we needed to leave.It was a beautiful area and we loved it.We traveled in July. Temperatures were in the high 90's. It is usually hotter and in the 100's during this time. We took plenty of water and a lunch. Many of the arches were accessible by everyone, others required some climbing or maneuvering over rocky areas. There were young kids, adults, and older adults hiking at every arch. Some had walking sticks. Hiking shoes or tennis shoes would be the choice of foot ware. Flip Flops may make it hard to climb or walk through sand and brush.

I didn't know what to expect when I first visited, and I still love it after many visits back. Moab in general is a great place to visit. My favorite time in the winter as it has NO crowds there. It can have beautiful snowcapped arches, and canyons too. Arches NP is really pretty, and a must-see at least once. I highly suggest touring around other trails throughout, and around Moab too. Your dogs can go out on those with you (although not in the heat of the summer, please love them enough to keep them out of that extreme heat). Dogs are not allowed in the NP, or it's only on a 6 foot leash on the paved areas. So it is just a better choice to leave them at the hotel if you are visiting Arches in the summer, late spring, early fall.

Arches National Park,"My husband and I hiked to Delicate Arch. We arrived before 7:00 am and waited for the road into the park to open at 7:00. Hiking early with plenty of water is essential. We were able to make the hike up the long slick rock mountain within an hour or so. Staying on the trail is important. After we saw Delicate Arch we walked on a short trail to see a rock with Petroglyphs, and stopped to see the pioneer homestead. Go early as parking fills up early. Be sure to take water. It is a fun hike.","August 16, 2017",Great hike early in the morning,2,"Napa Valley, California",5
Arches National Park,"We did a sunset drive around the park when we first got into Moab and were in awe of all the formations.The following morning we did a sunrise hike up to Delicate Arch and had breakfast at the Arch. Definitely a lot less people in the morning than there were when we drove through at night. The hike itself is fairly short, but there's a lot of uphill on the way to the arch. Just be ready for it! The cairns are a little hard to follow at times, but just keep heading up and you'll be fine.That same morning we drove down to do the Devil's Garden Loop. One of our all-time favorite hikes. So many different arches to see, and there always seems to be a new or unique one around every corner. Lots of great picture opportunities. We did the whole trail with the primitive section, and we were done in about 4 hours, stopping for pictures constantly and having a snack break (about 7-8 miles total). The primitive section was actually better marked than the main trail, but obviously didn't have quite the scenery. Still fun to hike though!","August 16, 2017",So Much to See!,6,"Columbia, Maryland",5

Our Park Avenue hike in the AM was perfect - lighting on the rocks was gorgeous and the trail is just lovely!

Arches National Park,"My 15 year old son, my husband and I hiked two different trails in Arches. Because of a morning mountain bike tour, we didn't get to the park until after lunch and it was HOT (in August). We were somewhat apprehensive about even going, given the heat, but were very glad we did. We each had Camelback type water backpacks, which were a god send.The first trail we hiked was Delicate Arch, which we almost skipped because it was long and hot (almost no shade on the path) and the guide books said it would take 2-3 hours. However, we were VERY glad we did it because the scene at the Arch was so amazing. I've never seen anything like it anywhere. It was pretty crowded along the way. We saw several families with young kids who were fairly miserable; it's not really suitable for anyone younger than 5. It ended up taking us about 1.5 hours and we stayed at the top for maybe 20 minutes.The second trail we did was to Landscape Arch. This path was more shaded and not nearly as steep, a much more reasonable hike for families with young kids. The view at Landscape Arch isn't as dramatic as at Delicate Arch, but it's still stunning. We refilled our half-full water backpacks before setting out on this hike and were actually sorry we did. The water in the fountains was gross!!!Because of our late start, we didn't hike any of the other trails, though we wished we had time to do so. For this who don't hike, you can still see many fabulous arches and structures from the lookout points accessible by car.","August 13, 2017",A must see!!!,3,"Atlanta, Georgia",5
Arches National Park,"We were vacationing in CO and decided to take a side trip to Moab. Though I'm not a big fan of the town itself, both my husband and I found the trip to Arches even better than we had thought it would be. We did a smallish hike (4 miles roundtrip) that took us past the Landscape Arch, the Partition Arch, and Navajo Arch. There was a part just past the Landscape Arch that required a bit of climbing on the rocks, and perhaps not good for people toting some extra weight around. But my husband and I are 57 and 62, moderately fit, and did not have trouble with it. We didn't have time to do the longer hikes, but I would certainly return to do the Double O Trail again. It was hot there in July, probably high 90's, so make sure to take water, a hat, and sunscreen. Also, there are no restroom facilities on the trail. The park is open 24/7 and would be a fantastic place to view the stars, but when we were there the moon was too bright for great star gazing. In July, the parking lots for the various hiking areas fill up fast. We got there pretty early in order to beat the heat (around 8:15 am) and the lots were getting full.

Arches National Park,"If you could only visit a few National Parks, Arches has to be one of them. Some things are easy to see with little to no walking, other items require a hike of different levels...but all of it is breathtakingly gorgeous. It makes me happy this has been set aside and preserved for all to see and enjoy as it's a truly special landscape. It's busy as it receives many visitors from around the world...and totally worth your time to check it out.","August 7, 2017",Greatness of the outdoors and the jewel in the National Park system,14,"Misawa, Japan",5
Arches National Park,"This is a truly amazing place. Everything here is worth seeing and it will probably take a couple of days. Be sure to check the park website for all kinds of important. I'd be sure to plan very carefully, as it can get very busy, especially in the summer and on weekends. They're doing road construction during 2017 that limits hours and area availability, so make sure to double check that on the website.

Arches National Park,"This is really a beautiful national park and the arches make for very unique landscape. Definitely the highlight of our trip to Moab, and having visited both, would choose arches over canyon lands if only time for one. We visited early August, with highs in the mid-90s. Based on other reviewers advice, we started out early- on some days the park is open 24 hrs, you'd have to check the schedule, but we took full advantage. We got to the delicate arch trailhead around 6:30 am, hiked up, spent about 20 min at the top then back to the bottom by 8 am( we were at a pretty brisk pace) perfect time- around 70 degrees, right around sunrise. Not crowded but enough people around to snap a pic or two for you. This is the most popular arch and my favorite of what we saw.Then we headed to Devils garden and took on the full trail - about 3.5 hrs and we skipped 2 of the 8 arches with a few rest stops along the way. Our favorites were landscape, partition and double o. There are some challenging spots (scrambling, slick rock, etc) on the primitive loop, but we enjoyed it. I found this primitive trail significantly more challenging than delicate arch. There were some spots that required some strategizing, but nothing impassable as long as you are agile!Since the visitors center was closed when we came in, we stopped on the way out- lots of info and a 15 min informational video. A little tip- don't rely on the restrooms at the trail heads- they are permanent port-a-potties. We purchased the $50 southeast Utah pass- good for a year for arches, canyon land and a few others.Don't let the summer heat scare you, just get out there early!!","August 5, 2017",Worth the trip - go early!,6,"Dallas, Texas",5
Arches National Park,"Utah is totally underrated and the Arches is every bit as good as Yosemite or Yellowstone. The first pullover inside the park called Park Avenue will just blow you away and yet there's so much more to come. Balancing Rock, Delicate Arch, Windows etc. all make for a grand day and a can't miss experience. ","August 5, 2017",National Park Gem,15,,5
Arches National Park,"If you're going in the summer months, go early to beat both the heat and the crowds. We entered the park at 7:30 on a Friday morning and had no problem finding parking everywhere we went. We went straight to the delicate arch parking area which is about half way into the park. From there we went all the way to Devil's garden. We were able to find parking at both places but it was getting harder by 10:00. On our way out of the park, parking was pretty much full at every place we could see. The line to get into the park was backed up about halfway to the highway. The views are simply stunning from the great expanses to the arches and mountains. ","August 5, 2017",Spectacular doesn't do it justice,63,"Woodbridge, Virginia",5
Arches National Park,"Arches NP is an amazing place not only for the arches, but also for the great number of other rock formations that make it a geological wonderland. Some hiking is necessary to see the arches up close. There are 6-8 of these hikes that are not more than casual walks. Getting close to Delicate Arch is a real hike which should be done before 8:00 am in the summertime. Wolfe Ranch and the petroglyphs close by are a worthwhile stop at the head of the Delicate Arch trail even if you opt out of the hike to Delicate Arch. For those not hiking, there are upper and lower trails to get views of Delicate Arch which are not taxing. If rushed for time, at the very least hike far enough on the Landscape Arch trail to see that postcard subject. It is an arch in its final stages of existence and may not be there the next time you visit (or at least when your grandkids visit).","August 5, 2017",Super NP,31,"Atlanta, Georgia",5
Arches National Park,"Arches was beautiful but to see some of the sites you had to walk to them and that's a difficult thing for some of us to do. I wish there was some other way to get to the distant sites other than walking bit I guess it is what it is.We also thought the main ""arch"" would be easier to get to since it's advertised so much - but, unfortunately, it wasn't. Don't get me wrong - if you are in good shape and can walk distances then this is the park for you to visit.

Arches National Park,"If you want to go to Arches National Park (ANP) Moab is about as close as you can get for a base camp. The entrance is less than 10 minutes from Motel 6. Do not be discouraged by the initial backup of vehicles before entering the park. The NPS staffers at the entrance were efficient in their duties, the line proceeded through the gateway in a regular manner. The entry road remained congested once in the park for a short while but dissipated as we progressed on the road.We saw pretty much all there was to see, the only exception being the road leading to the ""Devils Garden"" (DG) which was closed just before DG due to construction. We went as far as we were allowed on the road which was time well spent but could not explore the far northern reaches of the ANP.Otherwise we stopped at every point we could and did some hiking. The highlight for us was ""The Windows Section"" featuring the North and South ""Windows"" as well as ""Turret Arch"". The hike to the ""Windows"" is relatively short and easily followed but is all uphill. May not be suitable for all ages. The parking area is big but also crowded. Spaces to park were few and far between.Your destination is beautiful to behold. Also, on this HOT day, with temps in the low 90's, the breeze was refreshing upon reaching the Windows. We passed a good 40 minutes just relaxing and enjoying the view through the ""Windows"" as well as our fellow travelers. reconnected w/ a family (Mom, Dad and 3 kids) from Minnesota we had encountered in Canyonlands at ""Whale Rock"" the previous day.

Arches National Park,"Was passing through to Phoenix and had to visit the arches, from all the famous pics how could one not visit right? The park is huge, we thought for some reason we were going to be in and out in about an hour....WRONG. Left 4 hours later as the sun was setting. This place is gorgeous, a lot of red, you're able to go to multiple stops and there's so much to see, get out of the car, climb rocks, take pics. The longest part of the trip was the hike to see the delicate arches. I just thought it was a couple of hundreds or yards away...so I was in flip flops and a sundress, definitely the wrong gear. If you go when the suns out, don't forget sunscreen, water and proper attire and shoes. The hikes about 1.5 miles each way and it's not flat, you're climbing up rock inclines, sand etc and it's treacherous, those older or have issues with breathing or knee probs or have trouble walking will be a difficult challenge once you take into the account of the altitude, the sun and the dry air. Be prepared to be tired afterwards, but well worth the climb. Once you get up there, people camp out for a while just to take the view in, it's quite majestic.For those not able to make the hike, there is an alternative to take your car to a lookout point, but it's from way below as I was able to see the cars once I reach up top, there's something very calming and pure about the place, it truly is breathtaking once you get up there. Allow for about 2-3 hours for the hike.","August 4, 2017","Beautiful view, get ready for a hike though!",15,"Chicago, Illinois",4

Go early during high tourist season, carry water, a sun hat, sunscreen and supportive shoes( not flip flops!) Take advantage of all the view points even if you aren't physically capable of the longer hikes. Also suggest driving clear to the end and work your way forward..helps with the crowds during peak season. Allow several hours unless you stay in your vehicle for the round trip drive..which is better than not going but you'll miss so much.","August 4, 2017",Incredible rock formations,16,"Lansing, Michigan",5

Having visited many National Parks and having just completed another cross-country road trip I have to say that Arches has been the most disappointing and least favorite of all the parks we've visited.As others have mentioned the construction has severely limited access to the arches, which is the whole point of the place. Otherwise, it's just ""Red Blobby Mountain National Park"" which is what we jokingly called it for the remainder of our trip. During our visit the park was closed from 7pm to 7am, which made our afternoon visit feel rushed. While we were there 75% of the visitor areas were closed. We saw a total of three arches. Park employees were closing more and more areas as we were there (before the 7pm deadline).We had a short amount of time and debated doing Arches or Canyonlands.

Arches has a lot of construction going on this summer and it will be nice when it's finished....many new pull offs and not sure what else. The main attraction, Delicate Arch was closed and we weren't able to see that. Park Avenue and Windows, and some of the others were open and crowded. Undoubtedly these are beautiful rock formations and the education one receives from reading how these were formed is exciting. I am glad I went and may even go again when in the area (after construction is complete) but I have to say, compared to Canyonlands and Dead Horse SP, Arches was a bit of a let down for me. The short hikes up to Windows is slight elevation but big wide steps make it easier. I wore Tevas and had no problem. The stops have toilets. My favorite was Park Avenue right at the beginning. Take your water bottle if you leave the car, and of course your camera! Arches is smaller then many NPs so you can see it in just a couple of hours. The gift shop was jam packed with people and a fascinating display of stone in there...plus some dinosaur fossils. One of the best visitors centers of several parks we visited. Peggy was super helpful for general Moab info and I had also seen her at the Moab visitors center where she answered another set of questions I had. She was 3/3 in helping me! (Thanks Peggy!! Greetings from TN!) I am guessing Arches is crowded and more visited than some of the other parks because the entrance is right off the main road leaving Moab.

Arches National Park,"Landscape Arch is a site to see, as it will probably not last! It's razor thin and very impressive. Windows is a great hiking area, lots of trail choices and impressive sunset. If I had to do this trip over again though, I would go in May or early June. Mid-June is the start of monsoon season and we hit a pretty rainy, overcast week. We still caught a bit of the sunset but no stargazing. Also, Delicate Arch was closed due to flooding. ","July 30, 2017",Loved Landscape Arch and Windows,0,,5
Arches National Park,"We were lucky to visit Arches on a cool July morning. However, we arrived on a day after a heavy rain. The rain left the roadway to Delicate Arch closed & the Garden of Eden pull out was also closed. Therefore, the park itself was rather busy as the people were mainly in the 2 major areas of the park. This is a natural wonder and should be a part of anyone's bucket list. We purchased an annual pass for $80 and we got our money's worth by visiting Arches, Canyonlands, the Colorado Natl Monument, Natural Bridges, Hovenweep & Mesa Verde on this trip. Arches was by far the busiest of these parks. ","July 30, 2017",Awesome,58,"Goddard, Kansas",5

Arches National Park,There is only so much you can do on a road trip to the States. We booked a couple of nights in Moab and dipped into Arches late in the afternoon we arrived and then later the following day after visiting Canyonlands and the Dead Horse Park. It did not give us long enough although it was not helped by the early closure necessitated by the current improvement work.What we did see was fantastic. On the first afternoon we stopped and walked at the Courthouse Towers - no arches there but stunning rock slabs like giant pieces of toast! The following day we headed for the parking area at Double arch and the North and South Windows. We walked to the stunning Double Arch but only saw other features more distantly. Would love to have gone on to Panorama point and walked to delicate arch but there was not enough time. I guess a full day here is the minimum to do the area justice.,"July 29, 2017",Needed more time,217,"Inverness, United Kingdom",5

Arches National Park,"This park is crazy popular for very good reasons. The arches, rock formations and landscapes are just extraordinary. When we visited in May, the park was closed from 7 pm to 7 am every night for construction work. The morning we went, a huge line of cars were waiting at the entrance and the moment it was 7 am, everyone raced through including us! It was funny to watch. Everyone had one goal in mind: the Delicate Arch hike! After a lot of driving we finally reached the parking. It was already filling up fast. People quickly set out on the hike walking real fast at first as they wanted to be the first ones there however, we soon saw a lot of people tiring out halfway and slowing down. It got hot pretty fast. This hike (3 miles RT) should def be done early in the morning or early evening. When we reached the Arch there were few people so we got to take good photos but once everyone reaches there you will have a lot of people in your pics. Inspite of all the crowds, this was a wonderful hike! We also visited Fiery Furnace Viewpoint, Panorama Point, Balanced Rock, Garden of Eden, Parade of elephants, North/South Window (only pics), Courthouse Towers Viewpoint, Park Avenue.

Also, the park hours were cut short. I understand the need to do maintenance during the months that are available, but during July??? This has got to be the peak visitation period!!

Consider a hike to pine tree arch it's a relatively short hike and a lovely view. It can be slick in places due to the sand on the trails so flip flops may not be the best choice in foot wear.

Arches National Park,"We came to town unaware of pioneer days but it got us into the park free and allowed early morning access. That being the case we headed out for sunrise at Delicate Arch even though it was about to rain. The off and on drizzle and overcast skies actually made things bearable. The park is well laid out, easy to get around in and offers so much landscape to view. There was a small amount of construction that did not cause problems. We also went very early which helped with crowds. The hiking was great. Do pay attention to all of the notices and take your hydration back pack with you and drink drink drink. Pack in your lunch there are no food facilities but plenty of places to picnic. Wear sunscreen and a hat is a good idea. If you have a capable rig there are also some dirt and 4 wheel drive roads in the park you are allowed to drive on. Overall a great experience.

So many different types and structures of arches. Best moment: we made the fairly strenuous hike up the Delicate Arch for evening (on Fridays and Saturdays, park is fully open) sights. We waited, with a big crowd til sunset and then most people left. I closed my eyes for awhile and darkness fell. I opened my eyes up and my entire vision, from horizon to horizon was filled with stars.

The geologic and natural features are breathtaking, and most are incredibly accessible for people who are less mobile and cannot complete long hikes. However, if you are able, I recommend making the 3 mile round trip hike (considered strenuous as it is mainly an uphill journey) to find the Delicate Arch. Its scale was unexpected, and location was breathtaking!! The only downside to this park was it was the most uncomfortably hot park I have been too. Very few shady locations to take a break.","July 25, 2017",One of my Favorite National Parks,2,"South Royalton, Vermont",5

The heat in this place is unbearable. Don´t take it lightly. Even if you´re used to hiking, the heat is beyond bearable in the summer. Always carry lots of water.

We have limited fitness and my husband has arthritis in his hip, but we were still able to enjoy a number of walks, including some of the longer ones. Take plenty of water.

Arches National Park,"We visited Arches National Park and discovered a wonderland of nature. It is definitely a bucket-list sight to behold. The hike to Delicate Arch is not for the faint of heart. It is listed as a 1.5 mile hike, each way, but feels quite longer. Perhaps this is due to change in elevation and the treacherous terrain that must be traversed to reach the arch. It is quite worth the effort. I definitely recommend hiking to this arch first if you are visiting in the summer months to avoid the heat and crowd. Also, heed the warnings about taking plenty of water, wearing sunscreen and appropriate clothing for the terrain. Many of the other Arches are within easier hiking distance. Sadly, some of the areas were off limits during our visit due to road and park construction. The Rangers and gift store were great. Bathrooms and water for filling drinking containers are easily accessible. Pets are not allowed for obvious reasons, and we saw one family member have to miss out on the park to pet sit.

Arches National Park,"This is our second trip to Arches and it did not disappoint our guests from Canada. You have to be careful esp. if you're traveling with old folks, the heat can be very difficult. We started at 8am and end our tour of the park at 1pm even that is probably an hour over their limit. If you can get a map the day before that would ideal since the visitor center opens at 9am. But there's Rangers roaming around the park who most of them has maps. Our favorite spots are the Windows, where can actually climb the arches, the kids really like that. My personal fav is the Sand dunes, it feels like you're in a different place within the park, you squeeze yourself in this small place the you're inside where's sand and arches meet...amazing. Next one and my husbands favorite is the Devils garden, the first spot to stop is called the Landscape it's about 30min walk to get there, the next one I believe is called Double O arch possibly another 30 min farther. This walk can be difficult esp. in the middle of the day, if there's away you can do it in the morning, highly recommended to see. The Delicate arch is what you will see in most logos and souvenirs around Moab, we have not climb this spot directly although we've done the overlook. The overlook is about 20min walk with minimum hike but if I were do it again I would probably do the direct path to Delicate arch (maybe next time). These are just a few great spots at Arches there's lot to see. We recommend to start early and bring a lot of water and put on a lot of sunscreen...enjoy the natural beauty of nature.","July 24, 2017",Must see,87,"Denver, Colorado",5

Arches National Park,"I've dreamed of coming to Arches for years. I've always been fascinated by the landscapes and formations. In researching the visit, I was terrified at how crowded the park was going to be based on the NPS webpage. They weren't kidding. We got to the road to the park entrance around 930. (Which was later than I had hoped) Luckily they weren't backed out to the highway. The NPS dais this is relatively common and you can't stop your car to be in line in the highway. I guess you just get to circle around. Anyway, we spent a good thirty minutes, probably closer to forty, waiting to even get into the park. We went directly to the turn out for Double Arch and the Windows. The views and arches were everything I thought they would be. I loved it. My kids loved getting to climb and scramble over rocks. Both of the sites were fantastic. Even with of ton of other people there, it was still a lot of fun. We managed to find a parking spot, at the very end of the drive, but be prepared that you might have to go to another site and come back to one you want. We went to Delicate Arch next. Well, kind of. We hiked to the scenic view of Delicate Arch. The hike to Delicate Arch itself is three miles round trip. My husband and I would have been fine with it, but our 7 & 8 year olds weren't going to make that after the climbing, hiking at Double Arch / Windows. The scenic view is obscenely far from Delicate Arch. It will only make you dad and disappointed because you can see all the people who are right there at the arch. Honestly, if you're not making the three mile hike to the arch, don't stop here. Find the next cool thing you want to see and go there.From there, we didn't go any farther. I wanted to go back to Balanced Rock. And, was pretty satisfied with my Arches experience. And there were so many people there. We loved Balanced Rock. It has a paved trail all the way around. A great place for fun pictures. We hit the visitor's center on the way out. Some interesting exhibits and a nice gift shop. We picked up some cool Arches shirts that were printed locally.Overall, a great visit. I'm definitely disappointed that I didn't do the full hike for Delicate Arch and that we didn't do the back half of the park. Maybe some day, will make it back. My personal suggestions. . .Don't mess around and actually be there when they open the park.Don't stop at the first couple of turn outs. Go ahead of the crowds and back track.Do the hike to Delicate Arch. Or if you physically can't, or don't want to, use that time to see a different arch.If you're making a trip just to come to Arches, do it in their off season. This would have been even more awesome with less people. And the temperature is probably way better in their off seasons. That being said, if you're the there in the middle of June, go anyway. Just get there early.You probably won't see everything in one day, so do some research at NPS.gov and find out which parts of the park are on your 'can't miss' list.","July 23, 2017",A place to check off the list,76,Oklahoma City,5

Arches National Park,"This gorgeous park, with its many red rock formations is stunningly beautiful; however, I would recommend timing your visit during an off season, if you can. Right now, there is much road work being done and the Park closes early on certain days, so the Summer tourists are crowded into the Park early. It is also the most accessible park from Moab, which contributes to the number of visitors. Delicate Arch was not accessible the day I visited due to flooding the night before. Long lines to get in and hard to find a place to park to hike, picnic, or just get out to view.

Far, few and nothing in between. Cell phone service will also drop to no service in places. There is a 100 mile stretch on I-70 when they say no service, they aren't kidding.

Arches National Park,"We had planned to only spend one day in Arches and one day in Canyonlands while in Moab, but ended up spending two full days in Arches National Park, with zero regrets. We had hoped to hike in the Fiery Furnace, however, during June 2017, the road to the Fiery furnace was closed due to extensive road work in the park. On day one, we hiked the 7 mile Devils Garden loop, which includes the Primitive trail. The loop takes you out to landscape arch, partition arch, navajo arch, double O arch, dark angel, private arch, tunnel arch and pine tree arch. There is a lot of scrambling on rocks, following cairns to stay on trails, and the trail is rated as strenuous. Add 100+ degree heat during the June heatwave and it makes it that much more strenuous! The second day in the park, we hiked to Delicate Arch, scrambled on rocks in the Garden of Eden and hiked around the windows section. On Saturday night, the park was open 24 hours so we drove into the park at night and looked at the stars- it was surreal. This is one of the most beautiful national parks we have been to and we plan to return when we are able to hike in the fiery furnace.","July 13, 2017",One of the most gorgeous national parks,19,"West Sacramento, California",5
Arches National Park,We went to Arches late in the afternoon to take pictures not knowing that they close at 7pm. They allowed as in for free because it was almost closing time. Visitor center closed at 5:30. Just passing by the scenic way made the drive worthwhile. We stayed on paved roads because we brought our dog. It rained and hailed while we were there but it stopped after few minutes. We were able to continue taking pics after. Would be fun to come back and hike the trails. ,"July 13, 2017",Amazing Rock Formations,34,"Baguio, Philippines",5

I HIGHLY suggest hiking to Delicate Arch first as it is 1.5 miles up a mountain the whole way and we were there around 1:30PM in the heat of the day. It was definitely a struggle, but worth the views! Take lots of water as suggested at each post. The three of us went through 4 bottles each.

Arches National Park,"This past weekend I decided to hike into Delicate Arch for a sunrise. I had a full moon and started my hike from the parking area at about 4:30 AM!!!With the full moon I was able to walk about half the way to the Arch under moonlight. This was amazing. On the latter half of the hike I used my iPhone light a lot as I got off course and footing wasn't as good. As I came up over a ridge at the end of the hike I saw the Arch, but between me and the Arch was the huge, steeply sided, slick rock hole you see in photos. I followed a few people ahead of me around the steep left side of the stone valley, and was cautious about my footing as a fall would have been quite dangerous!I realized my mistake upon leaving, after my visit! When I approached the ridge, I should have been a few hundred yards to the left. With that track I would have found the trail again which wraps behind a large rock mound, on the opposite side of the huge hole! This was a MUCH easier path.Note to self; bring a real flashlight to better insure staying on the trail while hiking in the dark! Even with a full moon.The sunrise and view were WELL WORTH leaving my hotel in Moab at 4:00 AM. This was an amazing hike!!!The temperature was below 80 degrees both ways. I still brought, and drank, 4 water bottles to be cautious. There were about 50-70 people at the Arch by the time I left to hike back, about an hour after sunrise. People were respectful of photographers, mostly, to allow periodic unobstructed photos. People took turns posing with the Arch, and most were quick.This is a hike well worth the effort. If you decide to attempt this hike in 100 degree temps, be careful, even if you're in good shape. Also bring 4-5 bottles of water. Enjoy!!!","July 12, 2017",Sunrise hike to Delicate Arch,17,"Charleston, South Carolina",5

Arches National Park,"We are from Australia and are travelling the USA in an RV so we can spend time in all the beautiful national parks here. This park would be right up there as one of my favourites. We didn't realise there were so many amazing natural arches and windows! Everyone should spend time seeing this park - a MUST SEE on anyone's bucket list! Allow time for hiking to them. Some are only a short walk but others require time, so take it slow and you will have no problems. There are easy paths to them. The drive into the park is great with an up head zigzag road and then only a short way into the park at the first vista point you are met with a stunning view of various rock formations like the 3 gossips, the sheep, courthouse towers, etc.. A short hike in this area takes you to 'Park Avenue', Wow! So worth it! Then you drive around the park and see all the other rock shapes, windows and arches. Even if you don't get out of your vehicle - it is still worth it as you can see all the rock formations and a lot if windows and arches from your vehicle. Do yourself favour- take time and see this place!","July 12, 2017",Absolutely amazing! Must visit!,81,"Gladstone, Australia",5

Arches National Park,"My husband, myself, and our 21-month-old daughter visited Arches NP a few weeks ago. While it was quite warm, we explored it in the evening and morning time frames, which made trails and stops much more doable. Do note as well that there are not any food service stations in the park, so you will have to bring in whatever food you would like to consume while there. There are picnic areas scattered throughout (see the map that is provided). Additionally, there are water refill stations at the Visitor Area at the front of the park and at Devil's Garden at the back of the park. Our favorites to see were The Windows, Double Arch, and Landscape Arch. We only saw Delicate Arch from a 1 mile distance, which was still work the short hike to see. We had a fairly good view with our camera lens, but want to return when our little one is a bit older to do the longer hike to see it at its base.","July 12, 2017",Wonderful trip with a pre-toddler,45,"Dayton, Ohio",5
Arches National Park,"Arches is an awesome experience!' We came here after the Grand Canyon and the scale was still unbelievable! We had fun exploring the trails especially Windows Rock which allows you a little more up close hiking and climbing than some of the other arches. Landscape Arch is also fantastic and is not too strenuous of a hike. We viewed Delicate Arch but did not have time to do the complete hike up to it. We hiked Park Ave. trail, very hot in July.","July 12, 2017",Epic!,41,"Naples, Florida",5

The main viewpoints are clearly marked and the roads are easy to navigate. You can see many of the arches from the pull offs, or you can hike in on the marked trails to get closer to them. Bring plenty of water in the summer. There is a bottle filling station at the Visitor's center and you can pick up a map of the park there also. We had limited time as the park was closing early due to roadwork within Arches when we visited so a ranger was able to tell us what we would be able to do in 3 hours.

Arches National Park,"Arches is quickly accessible from Moab, UT, so lodging and restaurants are also readily available. The rates for rooms are much better in the off season, and many of the hikes are more enjoyable. In the heat of summer, Delicate Arch becomes quite an endurance feat. You need a lot of water for the hike, and of course, bring your camera. Most of the arches and balanced rocks and such are but a short stroll from the vehicle if you are not up to a longer hike. And nearby, there are arches such as Corona Arch outside the park that are no less spectacular. Don't confine yourself to only the park if you want to see the best arches. Mesa Arch is outside the park, but is the best sunrise shot. Of course, this is no secret, so you will have much company when you photograph sunrise with this arch.A family can casually tour the park and get out and walk to several arches. If everyone can't do the 3 mile delicate arch hike, no worry, since the park has much to offer. Double Arch is a very short stroll and quite unique. A bigger commitment is to explore Fiery Furnace (ranger led hike). It is a good explore requiring some agility.The main desert issue is water. Bring lots regardless when you hike.

Arches National Park,"Our group (3 generations: 4 adults, 1 child) had a lovely time at Arches National Park. We arrived around 9am, and waited less than 5 minutes at the gate. Our first stop was the Visitors Center. The center has some nice exhibits about the geology and wildlife of the area. My son picked up a Jr Ranger booklet at the visitors center (for free). We highly recommend the JR Ranger program to anyone taking children to a national park. My son always has fun filling the books out and its a great way to engage kids with what they are seeing. Completion of the booklet requires attending a ranger program or watching the park movie. We love ranger programs. But if you are short on time, the movie is only about 15 minutes long and plays at the visitors center all day. The rangers were super friendly and informative when discussing the Jr Ranger program with my son. Our group enjoyed the Windows/Turret Arch loop hike. Its an easy 1 mile loop. The rock formations are stunning and offer some shade during the hike. Due to ongoing roadwork, a few viewpoints and the campground were closed. This is expected to continue through the rest of the year. An additional disappointment was that Fiery Furnace hikes were not offered while we were there, due to the construction. I believe they are supposed to resume in August.Due to time constraints, we opted for the delicate arch viewpoint hike instead of the delicate arch hike. This trail is all uphill, but is very short. Our group enjoyed it.We hiked to landscape arch and around the Devils Garden area a bit. The hike to/from landscape was level gravel and about 1.5 miles.

The park doesn't open until 7a.m. due to construction from Sunday-Thursdays this summer. We drove back to the Delicate Arch Trail Head and were able to find a parking spot right away. It was already pretty crowded and it seemed like hundreds of people were already started up the trail. It was a nice hike uphill with a great view of the arch that was perfect for pictures. Coming down was pretty hectic because there were SO many people hiking up. We then hiked the Windows Arch Trail where we saw the Turret Arch, and the North and South Windows. After visiting the South Window we jumped on the primitive trail, which unlike the other trails, was not crowded at all. Make sure to bring PLENTY of water. We brought a cooler that we kept gallons of water in it to refill our metal containers. We were able to refill our kids containers between each hike with ice cold water.","July 8, 2017",Go Early!,35,,5

We hiked the Devils Garden and enjoyed the views. We thought about Delicate Arch, but bailed when we saw the crowds and how hot it was.

Arches National Park,"Wow! Wow! Wow! To see the Landscape Arch, Double Arch, Balanced Rock and most of all, the very most special of them all: Delicate Arch!! Brought tears to my eyes! You have to stop, put down that phone and really look and think about what you are seeing to fully appreciate these striking formations. Long ago the sea ripped thru and carved it out along with the wind. Delicate Arch is the arch you see on all the Utah license plates. Hike down to it for a better look. There is no other arch like Delicate Arch. It is completely self supporting. Looking for shade? There is none! I'm not kidding. Seriously there is not a lick of shade anywhere. But here's my best tip: an umbrella. An umbrella is the smartest and easiest tool you can carry to beat the unrelenting sun! Walking to the arches is tough in the heat and sun. Use an umbrella to easily make your own shade to cover your face, head, shoulders, neck and chest. If it keeps you even one degree cooler it's worth it. Water is a must. Bring about 32 ounces of water for every person and each child. Refill often. Keep pushing water. The two things that can really get you are overheating and over exertion. Enjoy Arches, it's truly wonderful and amazing!","July 8, 2017","Arches, my favorite park in Utah!!",96,"Sterling, Virginia",5

We were actually at the end of a fin and needed to turn left but the carins were missing so we turned right and found ourselves down in the ravine. Do you know how hot it gets in July in the ravine? When we finally found the Double O Arch, it was way past noon and still had to hike back out. We were trying to get in and out as soon as possible because of the heat. The crazy part were the number of people hiking in that deep with ONLY one 16 oz. bottle of water!!!! No, you need at least 2 liters. We will never forget that trip.

Arches National Park,"This is our least favorite park of the five we visited in Utah. It was under construction as they were paving the roads at night, so everyone had to be out of the park by 7:00 pm or you would be fined. This put us on a bit of a rush as we did not arrive in Moab until 3 pm and we were only there for one evening. The park boasts 17000 arches, however we really only saw about eight that we considered worth the trip. It is interesting that the arches are more or less in this one area, as all the parks have differences in their rock formations. It is great for hiking. We only give it an average as we really expected to see a lot more arches. Perhaps there were several more on the one trail that was closed off.

Arches National Park,"Just an amazing place to visit. We luckily planned our day well as the temperature got well above 100. Our first stop was the hike to Delicate Arch. The brochures rate this hike as easy but I would differ. It says the elevation climb is only 500 feet but liming in Arizona and doing a lot of hiking there it is easily more than that. It took us about an hour to get to the Arch. Do not stop short as you just have to go around the corner towards the end to get there. The area was crowded so no chance to take a picture without people in it unless you go first thing in the morning. This was the most strenuous thing we did. The other areas including Balanced Rock, Sand Arch and the Windows area are close to the road or involve very short hikes. My wife and I liked the Windows area the best. We were able to do most of the park in a single day. ","July 7, 2017",Amazing,51,"Rio Verde, Arizona",5

Arches National Park,"I was astonished at how people were just racing around as if to say "" I just saw this first- nyah nyah nyah"" This is a huge reserve, it has more nooks and crannies than perhpas even the canyonlands and yet people zoom inot a parking area - jump out- hit the rest rroom - look arouind jump into the car and zoom off- NO NO NO. I will share some pictures of some of the things you can see if you jsut take your time. While i was on the trail I would have people try and turn this inot demonstration of speed walking. THis is not necessary - just try to slow down to the pace of the arches themselves to get a vast appreciation for the beauty in front of you .Unfortunately we went on a hot day 95+ -but at that it was still good to wander around and see things- small birds I had not seen anywhere before- a single prickly pear rose - barely hanging on- wind blasted stumps making eerie sculptures. All beauty .IF you are coming here- prepare for mid day heat - lots of water and because of the altitude- perhaps some salt pills or electrolytes. Also bring a bandana for your face- or you can expect a free dermabrasion treatment once you get out of the safety of the parking lots. The park entrance leaves a lot to be desired- often the lines stretch out to the entrance light and a little beyond . -And this was mid week.If you have a cranky car or trailer- give them a rest before you climb the hill to the main areas of the park or expect radiator problems. There are plenty of places to pull over - but it seems that many people are not comfortable driving unless they are 3 feet behind you . Any more space and they feel like they are too exposed- haha. Explore all the side roads and as many of the hikes as you are able to. You could easily spend a month here but if you only have one day or so - try the easier trails.They are repairing roads. Check before you come to see if there are road closures. We did not see the whole park because of road closures- that were supposed to be at night only but somehow extend into all day as well. Stop at the visitor center first to get oriented to desert life. Stop and turn around often- you will be surprised at what you missed seeing by just not looking back.

We tried to see some of the sites that we missed the first time. Spent some time hiking around the double arches. Took a short hike to the delicate arch overlook. Hiked the trail to landscape arch.

Instead do the small access road to another parking lot with a two minute walk to several spots where you can view the arch and get a great photo. That's my secret...the hike to the arch can be difficult, especially in grueling heat. Do the hike if you're able, but do the stroll if you just want to see it. And NO DOGS allowed on the trail!

Even the last half mile is different since is is mostly solid rock (sloping uphill and a gentle angle), but the final 100 yards is what makes the trip. That part is on a wide ledge that runs around the edge of an outcropping so you don't see anything until you get the ""money"" view in the photo. Also there is another ledge between the foreground of that photo and the arch that also is interesting and can't really be seen well in photos.

From there we drove to and hiked around Devil's Garden - taking in Tunnel arch, Pine Tree arch and Landscape arch. Very easy hike. Fiery Furnace was closed but you can still see it from the road. We ate our lunch sitting on the rocks in the shadows of Garden of Eden which provided a 360 degree view - stunning!

While we weren't really able to get out and hike, the views from the car and overlooks were amazing.There are a few stops along the main road that don't require much effort to see some great scenery. Balanced Rock is right off the main road, and we saw Delicate Arch from the lowest viewpoint. It was too far away to see well, so I guess we'll need to hike it when our kids are older!

The views of the terrain and arches are wonderful but to see some of the arches you have to walk up to 3 miles. It didn't take long before finding a parking spot became more difficult and lines into the restrooms got longer. Many of the turn-outs are being improved and are not yet available when desiring to take pictures. A visit was made to the Information Center after spending 3-4 hours in the park.

Arches National Park,I would just like to point out one hike in particular. Hiking for children (as well as anyone not used to our heat) over the sandstone up to Delicate Arch can be tough during the summer months because the heat coming from the Sandstone and the Sun is INTENSE. It never fails to see parents/Family Members trying to provide shade with their bodies while the child or family member is sitting on the hot Sandstone red face and very unhappy. From the parking lot to the top is 1.6 miles and children really have a hard time in the heat. One 16 ounce bottle is not enough! PLEASE BRING EXTRA WATER OR INVEST IN HYDRATION BACKPACKS.

Arches National Park,"We stopped at Arches N.P. as part of a larger trip through several national parks. So far, this park was our favorite. We travel with an older woman who has trouble walking, so we really appreciate parks that are easily seen from a scenic drive. This park met that need beautifully. While hiking the trails will certainly make your visit to Arches that much more enjoyable, we felt that the drive allowed us to see a good representation of what the park is like. The drive starts at the visitor's center and immediately you go up a switchback section until you come out into the amazing views of Arches. To go from the visitor's center to the end of the road at each Devil's Garden/Delicate Arch/Windows will take you about 45-60 minutes one way, making absolutely no stops at all along the way. There are several great viewpoints/trailheads to stop at any enjoy, even if you can only see them from the parking lot. The park is currently undergoing road work and some areas may be closed during your visit in 2017 and possibly into 2018. During our visit Fiery Furnace and the Salt Valley Overlook were both closed. The park's roads were closing at 7pm Sunday-Thursday, so keep that in mind as well if you are visiting during the summer of 2017.

The topography is truly out of this world and jaw dropping at every turn. If you have kids, the Windows hike is very fun and easy (only about 2 miles total) and there is not much of an elevation change. Delicate Arch (which is the most famous in photos) is a 3 mile hike that is challenging but not impossible. If you go in the summer, hike in the mornings and bring lots of water.

For Arches you can see all the highlights and do the big loop hike, the Devils Garden trial in one long day. Be warned. There is just a small sign at the beginning of the Devils Garden trail that says it is a difficult hike; it is very difficult hike. It is well worth it if you are FIT. Nevertheless i saw parents take little kids on this trail. Not sure if they completed the loop or doubled back. There are some very steep ascents and descents. The trial is not always well marked and not always obvious. Near the top of the loop there is a very steep but short rocky drop. Some young kids scrambled down but there were also young burly guys that froze on the side and couldn't go up or down,and needed someone with climbing ropes to help them.

It was too hot (in October!) and we were too late to take the hike to Delicate Arch, but we did the scenic drive and saw several other arches and rocks (balanced rock), like the windows and landscape arch and eventually also delicate arch although from a distance. They look all so beautiful and delicate not only delicate arch itself, if you hear how they are formed and how they will crumble again (awful and beautiful at the same time because other arches will be formed like it does for million years already). You have to walk also to the other arches, short or a bit longer and also that were challenges because of the underground (rocky, sandy) and the heat (little shadow), but it all was worth it.

She was at the trailhead to Delicate Arch, turning people away. I am not sure if this is the normal hours of the park or because of the heat? I would have liked to hike it, but because of our timing, wouldn't have made it back in time. We allowed my 2 teenage boys to run the trail up and back to make it in time. I had to listen to them rave about how COOL Delicate Arch was. Good for them I guess but again, not sure why they wouldn't be open until say 9pm?

We saw a bunch of sites, including Double Arch and Balanced Rock, among others. The next morning we went about 9 (most say to get there as early as you can, and definitely before 10am or after 4pm, but we had a tired group) and it was a bit busier and was starting to get hot. We went on the Delicate Arch hike! Just wow. A pretty tough hike in the heat (got warm quick). Mother in law made it about halfway until the heat and altitude got to her. My 11 year old daughter almost gave up a few times, but she made it, along with my wife and son to the top. So worth the view. A little scary close to the top for those who don't like heights.

Arches National Park,"This is a huge national park that can be done in a day but is better broken up into several shorter visits. I visited with my husband and three children (9, 9 and 4). We woke up early (got there at 7am when the park opened) an immediately hiked up to Delicate Arch. In my opinion, this is a huge part of the draw of the park. It's 3 miles round trip and can be challenging for some (we had to carry the 4 year old much of the way), but worth every minute. The arch is amazing and the overall view is breathtaking. We also walked and climbed in the Windows area. The kids had a ton of fun there since they basically got to play around on the rocks. Much of the park can be seen just by driving around. There are several toilets at a few of the stops. We came back after dark to view the stars by Balanced Rock. That's an amazing site that you can't see in most parts of the country. Th visitors' center is very well done. It has a movie (really helped us understand how the formations happened...my kids even enjoyed it), a small museum type area that shows different types of rocks and how the formations were made in more detail and a well stocked gift shop. If it wasn't so hot and I didn't have a four year old who's not really into hiking, we'd be back every day exploring all the nooks and crannies of this amazing park.

There is no food or drink in the park, so bring plenty of water and snacks. My favorite formations were seeing the North and South formations, the Three Gossipers and the New York skyline, among many more. This venue is great for couples and families.

Arches National Park,"This was one of our favorite places out of 7 parks we visited. The majestic beauty is overwhelming and breathtaking. We decided to visit Delicate Arch first. This is not for the faint of heart but if I can get there, anyone can. Going up to the arch was not so hard and really a nice workout and beautiful hike. However, once we arrived at the arch I could not walk all the way out to it due to the 80 ft deep bowl in the rock beside it. I was fine until I looked down. However, my husband and 3 children walked out and took photos in the arch. My husband even climbed down on the backside of the arch. There were nice little areas to rest for folks like me that are not interested in walking all the way out. But regardless of whether you walk out to the arch or rest at the entrance to the slip rock you can see everything and the beauty is indescribable. We then took one other hike that was much less harrowing but still had some adventurous things you could do and it was just as stunning. This was near Balance Rock. These were my favorite hikes of the whole trip!! Utah was definitely my favorite spot. I also enjoyed Utah being one of the least touristy spots we visited.

Hiking to the main arch is a bit strenuous, mostly uphill, thin air and the heat make it a workout. If you must do it in the hot sun- take an umbrella and a bottle of water for each person. Tip- if your looking for a nice drive or campsite outside the park take the scenic route (123 I think) it's a right turn about a mile (?) coming from Moab, before you are at the park entrance. Very nice and relaxing. You can stop and wet your feet in the river.","June 20, 2017",Most beautiful scenic area I've ever been to,5,,5

It seems in the past few years that Arches has been discovered by your groups and now your buses abound. Hikes are crowded, parking is scarce, looooong lines for the few pit toilets available.

Arches National Park,"There are roadworks this summer, so there are road closures. Also the park gets busy quickly, so get there as early as you can (we got there 7:30am). Depending on what you do, you could easily spend all day there; the more hikes you do, the longer it will take. There's also hardly any shade, and even though we had water, hats and sunscreen, we still got quite hot and bothered and just wanted to get back to the air conditioned car. Some of the carparks have those eco-loo toilets, but if you want proper toilets you've got to head to the visitors centre.Even though we knew part of the park was closed, it was still an amazing place and you'll get some great photos of the things you do see. We did the Delicate Arch hike which was crowded, hot and took about 3 hours round-trip, but was worth it.The visitors centre has the usual stuff. There's a 15 minutes video about how arches are formed and that the landscape keeps changing, but it was quite repetitive, cliched/cheesy and didn't really give you much information. If you want information, read the display boards outside the theatre.Tips:- Make sure you get a map of the park so you know what to look for and where to stop.- Check out the park's website - they have a PDF you can print off with info about the various hikes to various arches, difficulty level and duration. It also has suggested tours you can do purely in the car, and suggestions for what to do if you only have a couple of hours.- Make sure you go with a full water bottle and take spares. The only two water fountains are at the visitor centre (doesn't open until 9am) and at Devil's Garden (currently closed for roadworks). - If you're doing the Delicate Arch hike, go as early as you can and do this first - it's very popular and the parking fills up quickly, and there are law-enforcement parking rangers driving round.","June 19, 2017",Be as prepared as you can,32,,5

Arches National Park,"The only reason I couldn't give it a 5 is bc they chose to do Ross construction during season which cut off a significant portion of the park (devils garden) and unlike glacier who allowed you to walk/bike past the barricades, they actually had someone sitting there to ensure you didn't. The views, formations and science behind it is a must see!... however , if you have small children.. please , please, please reconsider for when they are older. Maybe 9 and up. We came across countless crying toddlers and babies who were understandably hot... it is the desert .. and folks there is little to NO shade... wind gusts one day got up to 60 mph (clearly we didn't hike that day) . Although not that windy everyday , it stayed around 20 mph with sand, dirt and rocks pelting you so as an adult it smarted.. a baby or toddler it must've been painful. I watched many little kids cowering behind rocks to get away from being pelted. Don't get me wrong , this national park offers us incredible understanding into the earliest elements of our planet and should be on all by bucket lists but be cognizant of who is in your group.

Arches National Park,"...camp in the park and take the time to hike all over the place!My wife and I spent a few hours there last Monday. We slept in Wells NV and drove early in the morning. In retrospect, we should have slept closer to the park to start our visit early in the morning, but our itinerary didn't allow it.First thing: make sure you come into the park with a full tank of gas. You will doing a lot of driving and there are no services of that sort inside. The day we visited there was moderate traffic. We stopped at the visitor center first, got a map and started driving. Our first stop was Park Avenue. We did a little bit of walking around that area. Next, we drove to loop for Garden of Eden, Parade of the Elephants and Double Window. This place was more crowded, with little to no space to park. We did take the time to walk around and take a few pictures. After that, we drove towards Devils Garden (campgrounds closed) to visit The Sand Dune Arc and Broken Arc.In order to get this done, you have to hike. It was windy and sand was blowing all over the place. Be prepare: you need to cover your face or have sunglasses that wrap around your face to keep sand away from your eyes. I took off my t-shirt and covered my whole head, using one of the arm holes as my way to see where I was going.It was a nice visit. As I mentioned in the title, we need to come back and camp inside of the park. It is recommended that you spend a night there to see the arches at sunset and sunrise.

Arches National Park,"Some people travel to Utah as a destination. Some are just traveling through. If you are in the latter category, you need to pull off I-70 and get up close to what you've been seeing in the distance - those magnificent red rock formations. Once you turn south on US-191 at Crescent Junction, it's about 30 minutes to the park entrance, depending on traffic. By luck, we arrived around 4 p.m. and did not even have to pay an entrance fee. Be prepared, though, for a $25.00 cost per car, which I would have happily paid to support our national parks. Although still crowded, people are fewer at this time of day and the late afternoon light makes for striking photographs. This is a park you drive through, stopping or not stopping at viewing points along the way. There are plenty of hiking trails as well if you have the time. The Delicate Arch, the most famous of the park's structures is pretty far away from the viewpoint. To get closer requires a moderate half hour hike. To get really close involves a three mile strenuous hike.

Arches National Park,"Firstly, the park itself is absolutely beautiful. My discrepancy is how the park is handling the lengthy roadworks inside the park.Let me say that I fully understand that these roadworks are necessary and have to be done at some time or other. However I think the closure times could be better handled. From Sunday to Thursday, the park is closed at night from 7pm to 7am. This means that all park visits (including hiking) need to be done at the hottest times of day.We are also deprived of sunrises and sunsets. If 12 hours per night are need for works, couldn't the park open and close earlier or open and close later? Are 12 hours per night needed? Wouldn't 10 suffice?Also the info concerning access to water inside the park was not up to date. The visitor center indicated water being available at Devil's Garden, although this area was closed. The NP website scedule indicated Devil's Garden woud be closed until the 9th of june. An update on the site said until the 3rd of June. However when we left on the 7th, it was still closed.

Arches National Park,"We loved our day at Arches. We felt that we did a good job of seeing the park in four hours. We did not do any long hikes but did get to each area of the park, briefly stopped at the Visitor Center, walked to see and take photos at most of the main stops. We felt that we got a good overall view of the park. Each area is very distinct. I wish we'd had more time at the Visitor Center. You could easily make a full day of it if you included any hikes or spent time reading the exhibits in the Visitor Center.We were there on Monday of the Memorial weekend so it was quite busy.

There are many people, and sometimes hard to get photos of the arch without people, but just be patient and you will be able to get a lone shot of it. Don't skip this hike in the park. The rest of the park is also amazing, traffic is bad and sometime parking was hard to find. I would recommend going early in the day to beat traffic and the heat.","June 17, 2017",Delicate Arch is Awesome,0,"Denver, Colorado",5
Arches National Park,"In our somewhat limited time in Moab it was hard to pick and choose which hikes to do in Arches. One trail we did was the Delicate Arch trail. Mildly strenuous, it was worth every step. Was a longish line at the arch for photos, but provided an opportunity to rest, drink water, and meet new people. Also really enjoyed easy hike to Landscape Arch. Be sure to take brief side trip off main trail to Tunnel Arch and Pine Tree Arch. Pine Tree was a hidden gem - beautiful arch, could go right under it, secluded with very few people so could really take time to enjoy it, rest a moment, and get great pictures. We stopped at most scenic overlooks and were never disappointed.

Arches National Park,"We made 3 separate visits over 4 days to Arches all at various times in the day. They're repaving roads so the park opened late and closed early Sunday-Thursdays. Signs were posted in all the parking lots telling you when you need to exit that particular lot to be out of the park by 7. The furthest areas from the main gate are a 30-40 min drive so plan accordingly. There are no amenities inside the park- no restaurants, no flush toilets (except for the visitor's center @ the main gate), no food to purchase, etc. Plan ahead and bring what you need for the day. We found a few trailheads with spigots that were suitable for refilling water bottles. The visitor’s center is new and nice but has nothing more than bathrooms, gift shop and interpretive center. Pit toilets are available throughout the park.Our favorite stops and hikes were (all of varying length & intensity):Park Ave area- the first parking lot after you go through the main gate. Viewpoints are short walks with amazing views- no arches just huge towering red rocks.-Windows district- Many trails here and ample parking. There's a nice ""primitive trail"" that takes you behind North arch and up to South arch. You can avoid the crowds, see the La Sal mtns behind the Windows district. Turret arch and Double arch are also in this same area.-Balanced rock- short, gravel trail, wheelchair accessible and closer to the main gate.-Delicate arch- if you can't make the 3 mile RT hike that takes you to the base of the arch, there are still decent views at the Delicate Arch viewpoint area (a separate parking lot from the trailhead). The vantage point is from the opposite side of the arch than if you hiked right up to it. There are two places- one very close to the parking lot and the other is about 20 min walk w/ a good many steps. It’s possible to get nice pictures if you have a decent zoom.-Wolfe ranch- near the trailhead to Delicate arch- this is an old homestead it what appears to be original condition.-Skyline arch- easy pull off, large arch and worth stopping forDevil's Garden area- they opened this area Memorial Day weekend but I think it may be closed for road work. If you get the chance to hike out to Landscape arch, it's worth it. This one may not be around much longer (nearing the of its life) according to the rangers. We took advantage of the Jr Ranger program, which was great. Tickets for the fiery furnace tours were sold out 4 days in advance so plan ahead if you want to do that. If you're able to stay until sunset, it's completely worth it. We visited the park at various times so the color and intensity really changes depending on the direction of sun and if it's a clear day.

Arches National Park,"We went in early June & I was concerned about the crowds. We went to visitor center and got advice from a ranger about exploring options. After dinner we went for sunset at Double Arch in the Windows section. I thought it would be viewing and a quick walk. Well, you really want the best view which involves some scrambling up rocks. Definitely worth it, but not easy. The next morning we set out for Delicate Arch. We arrived at the trailhead around 7 am. There are pit toilets...they were obviously well used (yuck, stinky...but do your business and get out). Some advice:1. Go early2. Have good shoes for walking3. Have plenty of water. 32 ounces is about right, but some in our group had less so they had to ration.4. Have snacks5. Have patience once you arrive at the Arch because everyone wants the perfect picture.6. Trail narrows as you get closer and there are rocks to walk on7. Try and imagine what it was like for those early explorers.8. Besides taking pictures, take time to really enjoy the view and awesomeness of this place.So many arches! If you go to tapestry Arch there is a lot of sand to walk through. Sand dune Arch is an easy walk, on the way to broken Arch and tapestry. Skip tapestry and stop at broken Arch if you are tired.Enjoy, but know your limits. ","June 15, 2017",Go early to beat the heat & the crowds,17,Georgia,5

Unfortunately the northern part of the park is currently closed for road construction, but there is still plenty to see. The hike to Delicate Arch is a 'must do,' but it's a fairly rigorous hike; so in the heat of the summer you'll want to do it very early or late in the afternoon. We also loved the various arches in the Windows area.

Arches National Park,"A 15 minute wait in line to enter the park on Friday afternoon the week before Memorial Day was annoying and unexpected - lots of cars and only 2 pay booths contributed to this delay. There was considerable construction at the entrance and in the park so you have to be aware of those also. 1. If you are doing the Mighty Five self-driving tour, you can see this park, Capitol Reef and Canyonlands (Island in the Sky entrance) in one day if you stay near CR, stick to the highlights with short trails on paved roads, start early and end late afternoon. 2. The closest place to stay near Arches is Moab which has ample lodging and restaurant choices. 3. The visitor center was not that useful in helping you choose what to see. The viewpoints we'd recommend are: La Sal Mountains, Courthouse Towers, Balanced Rock and the Windows Section. With short walks, you'll be close to the formations and have time to absorb their beauty. Skip the Delicate Arch viewpoint - you won't see much on the short walk and the longer uphill walk will also make you question why you attempted it. We felt satisfied enough to skip Devils Garden and Fiery Furnace. 4. Bring water and food - provisioning is scarce. Plenty of toilets but you may have a wait for one to open up on busy days. 5. Consider going in the off season when it must be quieter. 6. If you have time, you'll only be a few hours drive from Mesa Verde - a magical place. Plan on the better part of the day there and stay in Durango, Co. Bottom line: Arches is a must-see and we'd rank this park #3 of the Mighty Five.","June 15, 2017",Arches Tips!,52,United States,4

We weren't prepared for the hike to Delicate Arch as we had mountain bikes and then hiked, so I'd advise going to Delicate Arch early so that it's not hot during your hike for there is no shade on your way up.

The North and South Windows with their backdrop of the snow covered - even in mid June - Rockies are also astonishingly spectacular.Owing to work being done at Arches we couldn't access the Devil's Garden area however Arches is not just about...well arches... and the monolithic beauty of features such as Park Avenue, the Organ, the Three Gossips, Sheep Rock and Balanced Rock compare with anything we have seen so far in the four Utah parks we have been privileged to visit.","June 13, 2017",Not only Arches.,223,"Ashbourne, United Kingdom",5

Arches National Park,"They were doing construction overnight here, so you could not go to the park at night to watch the sunsets OR the sunrises. Too bad. But also, you could not wait on the access road to get in at opening either. Talked to another tourist who stated a relative told her that it was a ""short 1 1/2 miles walk to the Delicate Arch."" Don't believe it. It is a difficult walk, and even the rangers advertise it as difficult. Yes, it is about one and one half miles, however, you climb 500 feet in altitude and so it over rock and in full sun. Go early or late and take water and drink lots. That being said, we (seniors with bad knees) made it up, but it took us about one and one half hours to do so. Many seniors on the trail. The walk down is much easier. But it is worth it to see the famous arch you see on all the ads. And you just might meet people from all over the world and country. That is not the only arc in the park, just the most famous, and they are all worth seeing, if it's hot, you find that some are just as nice from the car in the ac. Anyone under 45 will disagree with me and say you should go up close to every one. Take lots of water, drink it and pace yourself on all the climbs here.

However, there is road construction this summer that has closed the onsite campground and the park itself from 7pm to 7am. We got there at the opening bell and there was very little traffic. When we left the line was pretty long just to get into the park. *** Please be advised *** The hike across the rocks into see Delicate Arch (the signature site at this park) is not easy. It took a good hour each way, and it is steep, slippery and cliffy in many spots. Take lots of water. Wear sturdy shoes that withstand the heat that builds up in the rocks as the sun beats down. Kids in flip flops will end up wanting to be carried or bail out. There is almost no shade on the way. No handicapped person accommodations and not dog friendly.

Arches National Park,"This was a spur of the moment decision. My Delta flight got into Salt Lake late and they offered free flight changes. While I was walking the airport thinking of what I could do if I wanted to stay in Utah, and then...there were the pictures. The pictures of Arches National Park. I said ""Gotta do it!!"" Delta bumped my flight from Friday night red-eye to Sunday evening flight. I had 48 hours and I was off. Locals thought I was crazy driving 3 1/2 hours but I told them that was a lot closer than where I would start from Boston if I tried doing this another day.I got to the park in the pitch black night about 2:30am. I drove into the open park with nothing but my high beams of my rental to see glimpses of the scenery. I parked by Devil's Garden trailhead. Stretched out for a couple hours nap before thinking I would hike and see the sunrise. Not this day. Sun beat me to the arches but I had decided I knew right where I needed to be 23 hours later. The first day's hike of about 9 miles was simply amazing. Pictures do not do it justice. Then I drove out, in the daylight this time, and scene after scene, turn after turn, the views amazed. The rock structures changed. The plateaus altered with vibrant contrasting colors to the sandstone. It was an amazing Day 1.Day 2 - start over an hour earlier with the iPhone flashlight (severely under-prepared) for the first 20 minutes. I reached Partition Arch at 5:30. 38 minutes to wait and watch the horizon light up. This pic is why I went there. I don't know if I will ever return and it was hard walking away from this spot.

Arches National Park,"We were staying in Moab about 4 miles away from Arches. Our first day we got up early and we were not the only ones! We headed to the park and got there about 7.30am and headed for Delicate Arch, planning to hike up. We got the last spot in the very large car park at this time in the morning! The temperature was heading towards 25c on arrival and by afternoon it had hit 38c. We started the first part of the walk the sun was beating down then we saw the uphill climb that you have to do to get to the arch. For your average non experienced hiker it looked horrendous. We turned back confident with the heat and our fitness levels we would never have made it. There are also lots of biting gnats that are at all the National Parks in Utah at this time of year and we did not fancy getting eaten alive on the long walk either. We did the scenic route in the car which was really nice. We were unsure as to where all the arches were as we hardly saw any. Maybe you have to hike to them all? This is possibly the busiest National Park probably due to it's proximity to Moab and all the tour buses that go there too. After 9.00am cars queue at the pay point for a long long way.Canyonlands South - Needles and Canyonlands North - Island In The Sky were both much nicer experiences.On the way down to Canyonlands South there is Wilson Arch at the side of the road which looked stunning, which you could easily walk up to.

Arches National Park,"Previous reviews have covered the beauty, hydration, dressing properly, etc., etc. I will only hit a couple of important points we gleaned from our visit. First, coming from sea level in Florida.....the hike to Delicate Arch will kick your butt (be ready for it). The Park Service signage states it is a three mile roundtrip hike, and is classified as ""Moderate."" That evaluation must have been made by a young person who might possibly have been sampling some of Colorado's latest cash crop. It is much longer, and steeper, than you might think. Arriving at the park early cannot be overly stressed.....if you want a parking spot at Delicate Arch. Hike to Delicate Arch first, and then do the Windows section. We did both and still had time to drive over to visit Dead Horse. Hiking sticks will make your life much easier.

It requires a hike that took us 30 minutes each way walking sort of fast to get some exercise. There are some ledges/drops once you get out to the arch so watch the young kids. If going in Summer, def go early to avoid crowds and heat. Oh, and seriously, take more water than you think you need. The rock heats up and you are so exposed.

Saves time and the view is majestic and as tiring. Still good exercise.-Go to the bathroom before you drive up; take water to drink. On the way out you can stop by the visitor center's less crowded and cleaner bathrooms.-Try to visit before school is out and during a weekday or you will encounter lines, particularly as it go past 11.-Dress reasonably.

Since it's a hot day about 100 F we saw the Rangers carried out a lady down the trial. This is beginning of June so we expect the heat will be greater than 100F.

Arches National Park,"Arches National Park is one of the famed Mighty Five in southern Utah that includes nearby Canyonlands, Capital Reef, Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks. Collectively, these are an outstanding range of protected areas to be explored and enjoyed by visitors the world over. The National Park is located just north of Moab, Utah which is a fine base for which to stay a few days if you want to visit and explore Aches NP. The park is normally open 24 hours a day but has restricted day time hours (7am to 7pm) From Sunday to Thursday night this season due to a significant road construction efforts taking place within the park. Note that the entry to the park can be quite busy in the morning time, particularly with the park not open to the public until 7am during week. As such, you should plan accordingly if you want to maximise your time within the park. Further, it is highly advisable to keep tabs of road construction and access status by way of the NPS website for Arches National Park as major sections of the park will continue to be closed at various times this season. This can (and likely will) impact your hiking endeavours this year so best to be as informed as possible ahead of time. As for the park itself, it is wonderful. Vast open spaces with towering sandstone structures, other genuinely unique landscapes like the Fiery Furnace and of course the many natural arch structures that can be found throughout the park. We particularly enjoyed seeing the Balanced Rock, the Windows and Double Arch, Fiery Furnace viewpoint and the nice hike to the iconic Delicate Arch at the Wolfe's Ranch stop. We spent a full day within the park, enjoying a fair number of short and moderate hikes and the outstanding scenery throughout. Based on our experience, it seems possible to see most highlight spots during 1 full day within Arches National Park. However, if you want to explore more leisurely or take in some of the longer and more requiring hikes, you will want to allocate another day or two for a more in-depth visits.Note: For those with 3-5 days, its worth splitting your time with nearby Canyonlands National Park. There is easily several days worth of sightseeing, scenic drives and hiking opportunities there as well. Note: Entry to Arches National Park is $25 per vehicle for a period of 7 days. However there is a combo - Southeast Utah Park Annual Pass for $50 that provides additional access to Canyonlands National Park as well as Hovenweep and Natural Bridges National Monuments. With this pass, you can save a bit of money if you are intending to visit each of these places.Good luck to all and hope you enjoy Arches National Park as much as we did!","June 4, 2017",One of the remarkable 'Mighty Five' National Parks in southern Utah,18551,"Hong Kong, China",5

Very short but lots of deep sand.The road to Devils Garden is closed for construction. Also note that the Park closes at 7pm Sun-Thursday for road work. This has to be done. Much of the park was recently improved and it's a nice drive.Please take care to stay on the designated trails. Refrain from wandering off into this fragile desert ecosystem. The ride through the park in the afternoon only took a leisurely 2-3 hours with many photo stops, potty breaks and hikes. There are many many lodging options in nearby Moab.

Arches National Park,"I love our national parks and have been to a handful across the country and they never cease to leave me in awe of their natural beauty. One nice thing about this park is that the majority of these arches are a very short hike from the parking lot. However, with that being said that means that every single one of them can get really crowded around mid day so I would say go early in the morning to beat the majority of the crowds. At each one, you stand there in sheer awe at the natural beauty of them. Their size, scale and lets not forget their brilliant red color. But don't forget, if you do decide to hike to some of them like Delicate Arch, bring water especially in the summer! This place is a desert so it gets hot and there is no shade. I cant tell you the number of people I saw with very little water. On another note, while this is a ""park"" I wish people would stay off of these natural wonders and not allow their kids to run all over. The desert is a fragile ecosystem and seeing people disrespect them that way angers me. This park is meant to be enjoyed by everyone and should be treated with the utmost care.

Look at our one photo of Delicate Arch with all the people in it to see the incredible setting. The views, wildflowers, rock formations, distant mountains make for a one of a kind experience. There is road construction occurring this year so check in advance what areas you want to visit. They may get shut down. Parking lots get filled up early so plan on visiting in the morning if possible. It worked for us with no aggravation. As stated in the thousands of reviews here, this park is top notch and one not to miss. Expect to spend a full day here at a leisurely pace.

We went on to the short overlook hike which we did cheek by jowl with everyone else to look across in the distance to a mob of people queuing up to take a photo of themselves under Delicate Arch.

Arches National Park,"Moab, and Arches in particular, are now among my favorite places on the planet. Words can't describe the beauty of this area of the country. Take your time. There is much to see. Windows and Park Avenue are my two favorite areas of this park, but it's all incredibly beautiful. I also think you can see the park just fine on your own - no tour needed. Recommend going when it isn't full-up visitation season, or it could get very frustrating. Also, if you're touring consider buying an Annual Pass for $80. We did Arches, Canyonlands, Bryce, and several areas of Zion, and it more than paid for itself.","May 29, 2017",Unbelievable,8,"King George, Virginia",5
Arches National Park,Visited mid-May before the big crowds but it was till very busy. Go early (8-9am) or later (4-5pm) as crowds and small parking lots make it difficult to stop at many key spots. You can see most of the best arches and views in 1/2 day and don't require any hiking. Some places you may want to walk 10-15 minutes in and around but if you aren't a hiker you can still enjoy it. Try to pick a sunny day when the colors of the rock and arches are brilliant from the sun and shadows.,"May 29, 2017",Fabulous but planning ahead makes it best,17,"Boston, MA",5

Arches National Park,"We left Capital Reef and headed to Moab. This is the long ride but when the speed limit is 80, yes 80! You make some pretty good time! We arrived in Moab and found it to be similar to Myrtle Beach - and not in a bad way. The boys, girls and their toys are different than what you see in Myrtle but it's a 'strip'. Several long blocks of stores, coffee shops, bakeries, pizza joints, juice bars, breweries, taverns, fine art, and more. Everyone is in the street walking or on bikes or cruising the street in every sort of contraption I've ever seen to play in the dirt with. We saw 4-wheel drive VANs, Exterras fully loaded like we've never seen before, dun buggies, Jeeps, Razor, and bikes with huge tires for the trails. Every sort of toy you can image used to play in the dirt on the mountains with, exists in Moab in it's uber form! The younger generation speak a lot about organic foods and free traded products. My favorite coffee place, the Moab Roasters make it a point to let you know that their beans are free trade and they recommend establishments that hold the same values in that respect. It's refreshing to see as they try to cater to people from all over the world! We met and talked to People from Switzerland, China, Belgium and many places around the US. It's a vibrant scene full of adventure seekers. You can see it and feel it. People are there to bike, hike, rappel, sky dive, fly, raft - we saw entire families on dirt bikes riding, 4 wheeling... lots of great energy in Moab. It's pretty clear that this small town is changing and it's changing quickly if you believe what you hear. As more and more people look to stay in the US for their vacations, they are discovering places like Moab and the challenge will be/is accommodating the visitors. We made our reservations 5 months ahead of time and many of the hotels were already books - all across Utah and not just Moab. As more and more people seek those ultimate adventure getaways, I can only see Moab growing into something like the Mrytle Beach of the west. I hope they elect the right leaders to manage what they've got going on there. We spend 2 days and 3 nights in Moab. We visited Canyonlands on Saturday AM and decided to skip Deahorse and do the 2nd 1/2 of the day at the Arches. We did this b/c we had a 1/2 Razor tour reserved and wanted to be sure that we had enough time at the Arches. There's lots of places to each in Moab (unlike the road there). The 1st night, we chose to eat at the Blue Pig. The food was actually pretty good and so were the drinks. There's was live music (one guy who I took a picture of). Christopher appears to be a an aritist struggling to make it. So, I was happy to take someone pictures that was NOT me or my hunsdand! when we got to Moab on Saturday afternoon, we headed into the Arches. We didn't go all the way to the top b/c we knew we would be back the next day. We took the 1st trail in the park that leads to the north and south side by side windows. This was one of the funnest hikes we took. We didn't take the main trail but the 'primitive' trail (don't worr! It's marked) and came in around the back side of the arches where we only encountered a group of 4 people! We could see what looked like marching ants of people along the main trail. These spots are so beautiful but I have to say, the # of people doing to same as times feels exhaustively too many. That night, we decided to check out the Moab Micro-brewery. The food again, was really good! We met a couple from Austin Tx who has been visiting Moab for over a decade. They have an Airstream they pull and like to camp in Moab. The too told us about the changes year over year and how asonishing it's been to see the town change from only a few months of tourists visiting to now a Mar-Dec season. We invited them to have dinner with us, Dion and Joel, and we just drank and ate, laughter and shared from each other's life and had fun. We thought we would meet again the following night but we have a HUGE day the next day and didn't know if we would even have the energy to head out for dinner again.We started the day again at the Arches. We got there super early to beat the crowds - 7:30 and the ranger wasn't there yet so if you were one of the lucky ones, you got in for free! We went straight to the top and started there. Sand Arch, wow! The sand we trekked over was many feet of the finest oranges sand I've ever seen. I've only seen sand this fine at hobby stores. And a gorgeous shade of orange - as it's it had been kissed by the sun. It was here that Jamie and I decided to take up rock climbing - pictures to prove it, here. :)We were don't at the arches by 11:30 and headed out towards the Dinasour museum where we were to meet Jessie for the 1/2 razor tour. There were 3 other couples so we had a total of four ""machines"" following the leader who road a 4 wheeler. Jessie was a great tour guide. He took un to Monitor and Merrimac, two famous buttes named after ships, then on the 2nd half to Gemeni bridge. The ride was super exciting most of the time, and terrifying others! Riding on the edge of the mountain unnerved me for a little while so its was like anxious exhileration, if there is such a thing! For four hour we bounced over rocks, sand dunes, rounded cliffs, climbed emanckments and just generally got pounded so cold beers were in order when it was all said and done. We were covered in very fine sand from it all, but I'd do it again!","May 29, 2017",An Adventure's Paradise! Rent the Razors!,12,"Huntersville, North Carolina",5
Arches National Park,"This was the fourth of 5 Utah national parks that we visited during a two week trip. Reviews for other parks will be posted. First, to set context; the parks are different and it's hard to compare. It also depends why you are going to the parks. We went to do day hiking (easy to moderate) and photography so this review is based on that. If you are there to just get on and off the shuttle and snap a couple of pictures or to do major hiking, check other reviews.While we were there, they had construction going on at night so the park was only open 7 AM to 7 PM and the some trails, by the campground, were closed. So we were not able to be there at the best photography times but it was still good. However, night, sunset and sunrise photos are what it is best for. We spent one day in the park and covered a few different hikes during that time. The ranger station was helpful and there is a water filling station at the visitor center but that might be the only one so fill up when you get in to stay hydrated.The morning hike was first to Sand Dune Arch, then on to Broken Arch and then Tapestry Arch. The first arch is very easy to get to from a short sand hike. The next took a little more time but was mostly over sand. However, to get to the other side of that arch and move on, you will need to go up some large rocks. The final arch was a good walk from there and involved more rock scrambling. Each of the arches are unique and interesting. The hikes are not minor but also, expect for the rock parts, not really a challenge.The first part of the afternoon was getting to the upper delicate arch viewpoint. You can go directly to the arch but it was a little more strenuous a hike then we wanted to do. Going up to the upper viewpoint was not a difficult hike but still is a significant elevation gain. If you can't do that, there is a lower viewpoint that is very easy to get to from the parking lot.The final hiking was going to North and South Windows and Turret Arch but except for going on the other side of Turret arch, it's not really a hike. They are all very accessible. Again, all are interesting and worth seeing. Lastly, we stopped at balance rock on the way out and all I can say is that they believe in truth in advertising.We were there on the Wednesday before Memorial day and it was already getting busy. Suggest you get into the park early and drive to the end and work backwards, which worked well for us. Out of the five parks, this was the busiest one we saw and I'm sure it's even more crowded after memorial day. Also, we were there when the temperature went into the 80s and it was already feeling really hot. That sun is strong so bring your hat and your sunscreen.","May 29, 2017",Unique park that provides good hiking and fantastic photo opportunities,17,"Morris County, New Jersey",5

Arches National Park,"Arches National Park is unique and amazing. ""Delicate Arch"" -- the iconic arch seen in so many Utah travel promotions -- is really wondrous to behold, although (and the park warns you of this), to get to the arch by foot, you have to walk a rather arduous course that includes a path that is bordered on one side with a cliff (and no fence is there for safety). Tip: if you plan on seeing many national parks during a twelve-month period, buy an ""America the Beautiful"" national park pass for $80. The price of national parks adds up quickly and the park pass is a good value if you plan on visiting many national parks within that one-year period.

Arches National Park,"Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side.Why do people stand under the arches?If you don't get the joke then the jokes on you. Seriously people, the arches are best viewed from 25-500 yards away. There is NO view standing directly underneath looking straight up, unless maybe you're a birder and permanently look to the sky? So not only is their no view, you're ruining everyone else's view. Arches is a great park (I live 5 miles from a national park) but it is extremely crowded with lots of people who don't respect it. If you're into the park scene, I recommend that you just outright skip things like Delicate Arch (or go really early and really late) and do any hike more 2 miles roundtrip.

Arches National Park,"We recently went on a road trip to visit all five of Utah's ""Mighty Five"" National Parks. Arches has spectacular sights like the ""balancing rock"" and the ""delicate arch"" and the north and south ""windows."" There are also numerous other breathtaking colored rock formations, and you can see almost everything from your car and from the viewpoints along the scenic drives.. A very short easy hike/walk is needed to get a good view or photo of the iconic ""delicate arch."" Two other more challenging hikes to see that same arch from a closer viewpoint or even from underneath are also available for the more adventurous visitors who enjoy hiking. Like Zion, Arches is viewed from the canyon floor, but Arches lacks the massive steep canyon walls and formations that tower above you and that are the hallmark of Zion. Arches also lacks the abundant wildlife that nature lovers appreciate in Zion. But Arches has a uniqueness in its geology and erosion patterns that is unmatched anywhere in the world and which results in the numerous incredible arches and windows that make seeing this National Park a must do.

A great deal but the price is going up to $80 some time in 2017.Arches is primarily a drive-through National Park. It does have some stops along the way where you can get out and roam around. The visitor center is a must to see. It has numerous exhibits showing how the arches, and other amazing sites, were formed. I highly recommend spending some time there before you venture off into the park.Basically, Arches National Park features red rock formations that are millions of years old. Many have been ""named"" (presumably by past adventurers coming the area or park rangers). It is certainly well worth several hours to see these amazing rock formations. Since you drive into the park and loop around to drive out again, you get the chance to photograph the rock formations from two different vantage points (even while riding in you car).If you are anywhere near Moab, UT, this is a National Park that should not be missed.","May 27, 2017",Arches National Park is primarily a drive-through Park,9,"Columbia, Maryland",5
Arches National Park,"Arches is a smaller National Park, and they are struggling to balance public access with protecting the environment of the Park. Don't blame the rangers for filled parking lots and long waits at rest rooms. The ""Mighty 5"" are being advertised globally, and the resultant crowds are a bit overwhelming to the rangers and others workers, as well as surrounding towns. It definitely deserves to be on your Bucket List, so prepare to avoid crowds by going very early or later in the afternoon. This year (2017) the Park is closed 7 PM to 7 AM for road reconstruction. We arrived at 7:10 AM and the parking lot to Delicate Arch (a very popular trail) was over 50% full. The hike was great, very scenic; however, the crowds were distracting, especially all around the rim veiwing area of Delicate Arch. Upon our return, the parking lot was overflowing, with two rangers having to do traffic control and parking lot attending. Lines to rest rooms were LONG. Arches is awesome and a must see; it has fabulous hikes, but plan your visit knowing you'll face lots of people just like you wanting to see the marvelous landscapes, including many from other countries.

Arches National Park,"Arches NP is amazing. One or two days could be spent at Arches depending on how much hiking one likes to do. The parking lots are very crowded at times, but that is to be expected when you visit in May on a weekend.Canyonlands NP is also amazing. There is a lot of driving that needs to be done to visit both the north and south side of the NP. It could take two days to visit all the stopping points. Once again, the time spent at the NP depends on how much hiking one likes to do.We did not do any biking or camping so I cannot comment on that aspect of Moab. The town is crowded on the weekends in May, but the Moab Brewery is an awesome place for food and beer. The Utah liquor laws have changed in the past few years, but you still cannot get a draft beer with more than 4 percent alcohol.Moab would be a great place to visit on the weekdays since crowds would be less. Overall, the two NPs are worth the price of admission and are a must see in Utah.

We took that as to tight, no place to plant it and its not needed anyway. My suggestion is take a hiking stick or staff, I walk up like a champ but coming down it's tough on my knees. My walking stick would have been very helpful. You don't have to have bad knees, you may be over weight, may not be accustomed to the elevation and oxygen levels and a hiking stick would be helpful to you too.BTW, I have not been on a hike in the Moab area that did not benefit from a hiking stick... for me and I see a lot of healthy folks, younger, fit and some carrying two hiking poles.

For early in season, it was very crowded on a weekday where I was turned away from certain areas because of lack of parking.

People were crawling over the rocks like ants. So disrespectful of the environment. All sorts of signs saying stay on the trail/stay off the rocks but they ignored them. ""No pets"" of course didn't apply to them and the wee tiny dogs they could carry - but of course the dogs eventually had to be put down to pee. There were line-ups of 20 people for the bathroom.

Of the three parks we visited, Arches was my least favorite. It felt more like a museum with exhibits. It was extremely crowded, parking was a hassle from beginning to end. And every where there are signs telling you ""this is not a trail"" to discourage folks from wandering off on their own.

Many of the trails have been widened and paved. The trail to Delicate Arch, for example, is wide enough for 4 people to walk abreast, which resembles a superhighway. And the entire trail was swamped with people, who loved to talk loudly about everything but the hike, the trail, or the arch they are going to visit. Devil's Garden, where the best hikes I had years earlier are located, was closed, so I couldn't find out what changes have been wrought. The National Park Service emphasizes ""visitor experience.""

And there were a lot of people. The roads never got crowded but the pull off and parking areas along the drive did. There were several places we had to stop on the way back through because it was too busy the first time. Be patient if you want to hike to some of the places. We were surprised because we were there on a weekday, early in the morning and schools weren't out for the summer yet. You are in a National Park, it is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful so take your time and enjoy it full circle. It is a drive thru loop, and some hikes require passes so check in with the visitor center. The visitor center offers a quick video of the park and information on the Indian heritage there and the different layers of rock and ddifferent formations you see along the way. they offer several ranger led programs so check the web site for that schedule. You can go from there to Bryce to Zion, I'm glad we didn't have to miss any of them because they are all very different and just leave you gobsmacked. It was about 25 miles off the interstate, take food and drink there is nothing out there but the park. I can see where it could be very hot during the day so be prepared if you are planning on being there during the summer months. Also don't think you are just going to roll in ther and get a camp site, chances are not good, call ahead.","May 20, 2017","Wow, wow, wow!",72,kansas,5

Arches National Park,"We made a week of visiting all the big parks in Utah and this was our first start. The beautiful landscapes - each one topped the other. Unfortunately, the road to Landscape arch and Devils campground was closed, but the beauty of the Windows, Delicate Arche and the Salt Valley will be unforgettable. They are also doing alot of road work this summer so the park closed at 7 during the week - which limits the ability to see the sun set on the rocks.","May 20, 2017",Beautiful but crowded,5,"Woodbridge, Virginia",5
Arches National Park,"Wow. The natural beauty of the surroundings here are just something else. But don't take the hike lightly! There are very few shade spots on the way up - so on a sunny day, bring a hat, sun cream and plenty of water - you will be thankful! Try to hike when the sun isn't at it's strongest - in the morning before 11am or after 3pm.We also saw a few people with umbrellas to shade themselves which is a good idea. I can't find the words to describe the views! It's just so vast and canyon like, with dunes in between. At different points your voice can echo as it bounces off the rocks. The Arch itself is a phenomenal rest point. There's a huge feeling of awe and relief among everyone. It's a really special spot. I cannot describe how beautiful this place is, and pictures don't do it justice. Go and see for yourself. Would 100% recommend. ","May 19, 2017",Worth the hikes!! ,27,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",5
Arches National Park,The park has many interesting rock formations visible from the car or via a short walk. The longer walk to delicate arch is up a moderate slope then ends with a safe wide path that is close to the cliff edge that unsettles some people.

Arches National Park,"First disappointment. I so wanted to visit the iconic ""Delicate Arch"" but the walk is rated strenuous. I decided to try the more ""moderate"" trail to the upper viewpoint. I do not recommend it--very steep and challenging. I did not think the view was significantly better than the view from the easy lower viewpoint, but in either case the view is not great and you need binoculars really to see the arch. Second disappointment-- part of the park is completely closed due to construction and the entire park is closed 7pm to 7am because of construction. Third disappointment--it turns out that in May there are bus loads of students on school field trips to the park. Nonetheless, the beauty of the park is magnificent. We had cool weather which made the visit even better. Even with part of the park closed, we spent 3 hours there.","May 19, 2017",great park but....wait til the construction project is done if you can.,65,reno,4

Instead I will tell you it was such a magnificent place which I hope to show you with a few pictures. Then I want to warn you to plan your trip well. We visited in mid May while schools were still in session. 191 thru Moab was packed and we saw more than one traffic jam. The hotels were selling out. The RV parks were posting signs of ""full."" Major attractions in Arches had no parking spaces left, and sometimes even trying to find a space was no good. I talked with some of the locals and generally got the idea that from Feb through June, things got crazier. In July and August it was too hot to camp. From Sept to Nov things got crazy again. And then in Dec and Jan things were too cold, and there was no skiing worth mentioning. So plan your trip well.","May 19, 2017","Such a Magnificent Place, But Plan Your Trip",23,"White Oak, Texas",5

Some of the walks to see arches were a little difficult for me on uneven surfaces as I have an injured knee at the moment. Also the park is obviously popular as traffic was very busy in and out of places, which distracted from the pleasure of seeing the views.

The park contains a variety of named features including, but not limited to, Park Avenue, Balanced Rock, Double Arch, The Windows, Turret Arch, Landscape Arch, Double-O Arch, Dark Angel, and—what every visitor wants to see the most—Delicate Arch! All the features found within the park's boundaries are highly photogenic—bring your cameras or smartphones!There are tons of hiking trails (varying in difficulty), each leading to one or more features of the national park, making it one of the best places in Utah to go have an adventure! A hat, a sunscreen, and plenty of water is strongly encouraged for each and every visitor, especially when planning to spend a whole day in the park while the sun is out. Especially being situated very close to Moab, Arches National Park is a must visit for people making a trip to that small city in southeast Utah!Arches National Park is one of the reasons I am highly grateful about having moved to Utah in mid-2012.

The park is closed from 7pm to 7am, Monday thru Thursday so the park service suggestion of going very early or rather late to avoid crowds isn't possible. In addition, the campground and trails near it were closed. We couldn't get to Landscape Arch, the one arch I most wanted to visit. Signs are everywhere that you have to leave parking by a certain time or risk getting towed. It was a pretty place, not really a visitor friendly place right now.If you haven't already booked your stay, I would suggest waiting until the construction is completed to visit, next year, I believe?

The climb to the top to see Delicate Arch is not for the faint of heart and is well worth the trip. Unfortunately today it started drizzling and the temperature was around 47 degrees so it was a little daunting. There are so many beautiful sights in the park that you really need to Google the National Park Service's website to see them all and pick out your favorite sights before you go as seeing them all is impossible unless you plan on staying for a week. ,"May 17, 2017",Climb to Delicate Arch,26,"Ocala, Florida",5

If you are going to hike, take water it is not for sale in the park. Also go early to beat the heat and crowds. Do NOT skip Delicate Arch toward the end.

Arches National Park,"I've visited Arches National Park several times and I honestly think it should be on A-list for anyone who love to travel and admire nature. The park is so unique and the scale is so grand that you really have to see it to really appreciate. I live in Washington State and for me The Arches Park feels like a different planet. The park is also very simple to navigate - it is single paved road in excellent condition with lots of viewpoints with parking and clear marked branch roads leading to view points and hiking trails. I would recommend to drive all the way to the end (about 40 min) and then you could choose your preferences. The are great hike at the end of the I'd say the hike to Delicate Arch is a must for every able traveler. It is couple hours round trip with nice views and the Utah signature Delicate Arch at the end. You wouldn't regret it! I also love the Devil's Garden trail, but this one is long and difficult. You'll get the nice booklet at the entrance with road and trail maps and very useful details. My preferred time for visiting is May and September - usually warm dry weather. It can get extremely hot in Summer and cold in winter. Be careful with the sun - I always wear hat and long sleeve and use sunscreen. Always have plenty of water. The park entrance is located at the north end of Moab city where you'll find variety places to stay and plenty of places to eat. Moab is worldwide famous for off road Jeep trails, so it may get extremely crowded during events - just check it in advance. Have fun. Be safe.

However, it's what you will find at the end of the hike that makes it all worth it. One of the most beautiful arches in the park. You need to have a nice camera to really catch the beauty. A smart phone just will not do it. Now, if you really what a challenge, sign up at Welcoming Center to do the Fiery Furnace, the most challenging hike of my life. It has it all. Slot canyons, boulders, belly crawling, beauty, steep up and downhill sections. May I suggest the app AllTrails Pro to help you find your way. At the end of the trail, my wife and I hugged as we felt we had accomplished what we thought was the impossible for people our age. We learned we still could keep up with the younger people, and in many cases, outdo them. What a thrill. There are other smaller hikes but not like this.

Arches National Park,"Breathtaking scenery and on a clear day, it's hard to beat this level of beauty. Everything was well marked and there were big signs to guide you around the park. The rangers at the Visitor Centre were knowledgeable and helpful.Arches NP is home to the world famous Delicate Arch and first time visitors need to be aware that it's a strenuous, uphill walk to get there. It's not located at a viewpoint where you can conveniently drive, park the car and admire the view. There is an info board at the entrance to the trail and those who want to do this should ensure they have proper footwear, sunblock (essential when it's a sunny day) and the most important of all, enough water. Try and do this visit during the early part of the day so you don't get too hot - once you get there, the view is great. The rest of the NP has some wonderful scenery and has good parking areas. Also, the Visitor Centre has water refill stations - so convenient and great for keeping down trash/recycling.This NP should be on your ""Must Visit"" list.","May 11, 2017",Beautiful scenery,66,"Arlington, Virginia",5

Arches National Park,"We visited Arches National Park at the start of our 10-day Southwest Utah National Parks vacation in early April. We arrived at the park very early the day of our visit, beat the traffic/car-line up to get in and got a head-start on some of the more popular sites before parking lots were filled. We hiked to Delicate Arch, Tunnel Arch, Pine Tree Arch, saw Balanced Rock and the Fiery Furnace and other incredible geological rock formations. The weather was perfect for scenic viewing and hiking - mid 60's/70's with a good breeze, making our hikes enjoyable -- I think it might be a bit miserable during the Utah desert summer heat. We did not get a chance to tackle every hike, but that now gives us a big reason to return to finish what were not able to get done.

We were aware of the road construction limitations (park closed for 12 hours each night). NPS website visit the night before returned a ""503 error"" for Arches, so no information available. We arrived early, drove to Devils Garden to be greeted by a road closed sign and a ranger explaining that this section of the park would be CLOSED for four weeks. We flew across the country for this.

Arches National Park,"We called by the Arches National Park on our way from Durango to Grand Junction. We had passed on a previous trip and were keen to visit.When we arrived (around 10:15 on a Thursday morning) there was a queue to get into the park. This moved fairly quickly (in spite of the fact we always choose the slowest queue) and within 10 minutes or so we were past the toll gates. You are able to use your annual National Park Pass here, which might make the visit a little cheaper if you have one. The visitor's centre was just inside the gates and we called in here to plan our trip around the park and pick out what we definitely wanted to see. There was ample parking and we didn't have a problem finding a space. The visitor's centre was very good and just outside there is lots of information on this park as well as others in the vicinity, which we found useful. The facilities were acceptable and there were plenty of them so there was no queue. We decided to head towards the Delicate Arch from the outset and then call in at any stopping points we wanted to take pictures from on the way back, but frankly the scenery was so good that we found ourselves breaking our own rules and stopping along the way to take lots of photographs. In spite of the queue at the front gate we did not have a problem parking at any of the viewpoints and both commented on how quiet the park seemed. We eventually made it to the Delicate Arch Overview, but did not realise how far away from the arch this viewpoint actually was - it did seem rather delicate but I suspect that was the distance we were viewing it from. There was a car park before the overview and if you want to get up to the arch itself you probably need to stop there and hike up the hill - we decided not to do this as we had already had a bit of a hike and it was the middle of the day so we wanted to take a break from the sun. The viewpoint we did go to was about 3/4 of a mile hike up the hill so good shoes are advisable, maybe walking boots but these are not strictly necessary, we did it in pumps. We would also suggest you put sun cream on as we found we burnt quickly at this altitude and a hat and definitely some water will be needed. Unfortunately when we visited there was a section of the park not open to visitors so we were only able to make it as far as Broken Arch and Sun Dune Arch. We did make it up there and whilst parking was somewhat limited we were able to find a space as someone else pulled out. After the Delicate Arch we were a little sceptical as to what we would see but these were much more along the lines of what we had expected and you could get right up to the arch from here to take photos. The viewpoints were fairly quiet and we suspected that Sun Dune Arch is so called because it is sandy on the way up there. It was worth the short walk through to see this arch. Broken Arch we saw from a distance as again we were starting to feel the effects of the sun even though we had high factor sun cream on. We would recommend going along to see these arches if you can just because the view points were a little quieter than Delicate Arch. We were not able to see any of the other arches as these were closed at the time we visited. The scenery other than these arches is, of course, stunning but we have to admit that there were fewer arches than we were expecting to see. Nevertheless if you are in the area and have time to call in we would definitely recommend a visit.","May 6, 2017","Worth a visit, but not as many arches to see as we have expected",49,"Peterborough, United Kingdom",5

However, the park avenue hike, delicate arch trail, sand dune arch trail, and tapestry arch trail were all great hikes. While it was relatively crowded, the more out of the way trails weren't too crowded.

Arches National Park,"This is an absolutely beautiful national park with great hiking. Many of the Arches can be seen with a short or no hiking. Some do require serious hiking. I would classify many of their easy trails as somewhat harder than easy unless you are a regular hiker/walker/runner due to the dense sand and inclines combined with the high altitude. I also think many of the distance indicators are ""as the crow flies"" rather than the actual distance covered. I would recommend driving to the top/end of the road in the park and working your way back to see as many Arches as your health and time allow. There are adequate restroom facilities and water, but no food so be prepared.","May 5, 2017",Beautiful Park,98,"Suffield, Oh",5

Hike to the Arch itself on a separate trail for a more close-up view. My husband has done that hike before and it is more strenuous, lengthy, and in summer is quite hot. We then drove back along the main road, stopping to see the amazing features close to the road. Take the short hikes to the Balanced Rock, Fifth Avenue, etc. All are amazing and well worth your time. Be aware that they are doing construction on the main road from 7 pm to 7 am Sundays-Thursdays throughout the summer, so you need to plan your visit accordingly.

We were 10 minutes from the largest arch in the park and didn't get to see it. We moved our car at 6, and headed to the gate as we were told it would take 1 hr - it only took 30 minutes.

Arches National Park,"Small by National Park standards, but just loaded with breathtaking, awe inspiring scenery. The arches themselves are amazing, but there is much much more to see, rocks balanced on spires, shear rock walls with all shades of brown and red, and lots of interesting desert scenery. You can drive the whole park in a couple of hours, or in a half day you can do some hikes to the arches and other rock formations. The Fiery Furnace is supposed to be amazing (we did not go to this), it does require that you go on a Ranger-led tour. The only negative of our visit was the entrance, the shortest wait we had to get in was 30 minutes.

Arches National Park,"Arches was a Leary a popular park. Now that the roads are being rebuilt expect some delays. Times may even prevent you from entering as the line could back up to Hwy 191. They ask you to ""go around and try again and not stop on highway"".The road rebuild plan needs to build a longer cue line to avoid this. Once in enjoy the postcard views form every overlook.Photog advice: As you enter get the well lit Moab Fault and the Park Avenue viewpoint rocks. Arrive early and proceed to farthest point in park 26 miles to Landscape arch up in Devils Garden. Do the 30 min. 1 mile one way walk to the Landscape arch and sunlight will be over your should for perfect lighting. Then go to Delicate Arch and decide if walking up to it (2 hours) or remote elevated view point (30 min. One way walk) Midday or high noon hit Sand Arch. Then hit Balanced Rock Garden of Eden and Windows Arch in afternoon went western sun will light up Windows Arches the best. Pickup Courthouse and Organ going out. That's the best lighting plan.What might foil this plan is people viewing the park in order (most do) and thus may not have parking at the site when you want. My advice, wait 5 minutes for a spot to open. Don't bring a mobile home in expecting to find room.Park is closing entirely at 7 PM Sunday-Thursday for road work so plan accordingly. You need to leave from Devils Garden by 6 :30 PM to exit non-stop in time. Late summer weekday users are going to get hit unable to enjoy the cooler temps with two hours of daylight left. Heads up everyone!Bathrooms (pit toilets) at most major stops. Water also. In summer carry water. If windy, a bandana or mask is needed from the swirling sand at Sand Arch.

Arches National Park,"We've been to Bryce, Zion and Canyonlands. Arches was the best of the Utah National Parks because you can stand right next to/under the arches. Here is how we spent our one day at Arches: we wanted to get an early start since I had read that the parking at Delicate Arch can get crowded (you can print the map from the National Park Service website). So instead of waiting for the visitor center to open at 9 am we drove straight to the Wolfe Ranch parking lot around 8 am and did the 3 mile round trip hike to Delicate Arch (parking was plentiful and the trail was not crowded). The terrain is pretty steep so wear good hiking shoes if you have them. We then drove back to the Windows section and saw North/South Windows Arch, Turret Arch and Double Arch (short hikes). Headed to the visitor center for a while and went back to Moab for lunch at Denny's (about 5 miles). Back to the park and stopped at Courthouse Towers, Balanced Rock, Landscape Arch and some view points. The park is vehicle friendly and most viewpoints are within a 5 minute walk (it was 2 mile roundtrip to Landscape Arch but pretty flat terrain).

Every part of the day makes the park look different from the first rays of sun hitting the rocks, to red rocks against a blue sky midday, to the warm glow of the rocks in the waning light at sunset. It is just such a marvel that these rocks are balanced the way they are. Everyone should see it before they die. Or we destroy it. This is a lot of construction going on but amazing when we were there over spring break we got parked in every parking lot we wanted to. My son did the Junior Ranger program which he loves. If hiking to Delicate Arch, a few minutes before you get to the arch, there is a rock ledge on your right that you can you can climb up that has a hole in it. Gives you a great view of Delicate Arch from afar. See photos below.I also loved Pine Tree Arch, beautifully shaped, nice views through it. Visitor Center had a really good movie that you should watch before you start exploring.

Hiked the Devil's Garden loop ... started with the Tunnel Arch and Pine Tree Arch, then off to Landscape Arch. Next was a ""walk"" up a ""rock"" that intimidated me about halfway up. Had to nearly crawl the remaing ascent -- or stay paralyzed there while the 8-year-olds hopped, skipped, and jumped around me with aboslutely no fear in the world (to be 8 again ...) -- but, finally made it, and tears welled and then flowed. Continued on to Navajo Arch (awesome), and then to Partition Arch (an absolute must see). Made it to Double O with some more steps of finesse on narrow ledges (good hiking boots that you can trust to ""stick"" are very helpful). Didn't make it to Dark Angel, as the park was closing at 7, and we didn't want to have our car towed.) Decided to continue around the primitive trail. It was a hot day, and we were very glad we had lots of water -- rock ledges, up and down -- sunlit trails, up and down -- trails of sand, up and down -- sometimes it felt like there was more ""ups"" than ""downs"", but eventually made it back to the area of Landscape Arch.

Arches National Park,We hiked two trails that were easy: Broken Arch with Tapestry Arch thrown in - about 2.25 hours; and the Double Arch - 1/2 mile. Double Arch was our 10-yr old son's favorite because he could climb up and down the rocks. Cool photo op inside one of the Double Arches if you can stomach the height. Great for all ages. People with disabilities can make to the base of the Double Arch but then it gets very uneven. A must-see national park if you are in the area. Moab offers so much to do beside the parks too.

Arches National Park,"If you're thinking of coming here, you must already know that it is one of the most beautiful and surprising landscapes in North America. And you probably know that it's among the busiest. Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on your point of view, the National Park Service has created a drive-through coffee shop of a park out of this awe-inspiring landscape. If you love quiet contemplation of nature's bizarre and beautiful eccentricities, take a walk in Canyonlands or make sure you go at dawn, or camp here and get up early (presently impossible, as the park is improving their roads and the roads are closed from 7pm to 7am--except on Saturdays and Sundays, and the campground is closed all year in 2017).If you want to drive to beauty the way you buy a doughnut and a cup of coffee, without leaving your car, you can do that here, but you will find that you haven't left metropolitan traffic, with its traffic jams and parking problems, behind. Neither you nor the 1,585,717 other cars' bumpers that your bumper will be flirting with. If that idea doesn't discourage you, then go for it. But don't forget to brush up on your Photoshop skills, because every photo you take of Delicate Arch and most of the other sites will have thousands of extra cast members, that you will have to erase from your photos, if you want your images to look ""natural.""","April 22, 2017",Beautiful and crowded,9,"Arlington, MA",4
Arches National Park,"Other worldly and mind blowing are a good start. We were pretty fried from all the other hiking we did in Canyonlands, Grand Canyon and Walnut Canyon, but did some of the shorter walks in between scenic overlooks. This park a well suited for seeing the essence of the park without hiking. You can do a very short walk or even stay in the car and see the beauty here. But the hiking is incredible also. There is something special about being up close to the arches, towers, etc. It can be challenging to take good photos and enjoy the scenery with big crowds. I didn't realize the week after Easter is still Spring Break, so we had crowds. I'm thinking in another week or 2 during the week, not weekend, would be ideal.

Just to name a few: Delicate Arch is the most popular and photographed (but totally worth the crowds); Landscape Arch has the longest span in the world; Pine Tree Arch was more intimate; Skyline Arch just off the road but had only a few visitors; Sandy Dune Arch was really sandy getting there; Double Arches was breathtaking; North & South Windows and Turret Arch also very approachable. There are over 2000+ arches in this Park. We had no time for the visitor's center, which closed at 4pm. Instead, we just viewed a youtube segment which explained how the arches were formed and looked like it was filmed by and for the Park. Be sure to bring food and adequate water (a quart per person was recommended for Delicate Arch).

These included the Windows, Double Arch, the lower & upper view of Delicate Arch, Sand Dune Arch, Skyline arch, Tunnel arch, Firey Furnace viewpoint, Pine Tree Arch.

Arches National Park,"We were here the first weekend of spring break in many of the Western States and Texas. Both Moab and this park were filled with people. I am convinced that young people and ALL people need to experience our national parks before they are saved in perpetuity. Wide paths led to all of the easy-to-get-to arches, and there were several. Delicate Arch was rated ""difficult"" (but not really), even for seniors in good shape. We did make the comment that the stream of people going up looked like the men climbing the Chilkoot trail in Alaska, except that it was warm, not 45 degrees elevation gain and we were not carrying 100 pound packs. Our biggest thrill was taking a half mile ""primitive"" trail around the back of the Windows arches. We were all alone. It was neither difficult nor primitive and a nice end to our vacation.","April 18, 2017","Amazing but crowded, and that is okay!",135,Washington State,5

Arches National Park,"Be there at 7:00 a.m. in order to find a parking place. The visitor's center does not open until 9:00 a.m., and there is no one to take your admission fee or give you maps. We went to the visitor's center the day before to get maps, info, and watch the video. The Moab Visitor's Center in Moab also has maps.This is a small park that is very crowded in March & April and very hot thereafter. Some of the pullouts are only big enough for 2 or 3 cars. Delicate Arch hike parking lot is large, but it was totally full by 8:00 a.m. The same for Delicate Arch Viewpoint. Both of these sites are a 30 minute drive to the entrance. Don't stop along the way to visit other sites. Drive straight there and park. You cannot hike to Delicate Arch from the Delicate Arch Viewpoints. The Lower Delicate Arch Viewpoint is about 100 yds. over a flat surface. You can see the arch (barely), or really well with binoculars. To take a photo, you need a powerful zoom. The Upper Delicate Arch Viewpoint is 1/2 mile up a very rocky trail. I needed my hiking poles and hiking shoes and I still had to take it slowly. And, when you get to the top, the arch is far away. You need a powerful zoom to get a decent photo.The Delicate Arch Trail at Wolfe Ranch is listed as difficult. It is 3 miles roundtrip, and the estimated time to hike is 2 to 3 hours. The terrain is quite rough and gains significantly in elevation. Follow rock cairns to follow the trail. The last 200 yds is along arock ledge.The easy hikes are: Lower Delicate Arch, Double Arch (1/2 mi. RT over sand), Balanced Rock (.3 mi at base of rock), and The Windows section (about 1/2 mile over paved surfaces and steps). I hiked all of these. If you only want to drive the park and take photos, the best vistas are at: Fiery Furnace Viewpoint, Salt Valley Overlook, Panorama Point, the road to The Windows Section (some pullouts),La Sal Viewpoint, and Park Avenue Viewpoint. Just driving the park and taking photos will take you at least 1/2 day. Driving and taking 2 or 3 easy hikes will take 1 day. If you are really fit and want to see it all, you could easily spend a week here. The passes at the gate are $25 for a 3 day pass.I recommend hiking boots/shoes, a hat, sunscreen, long sleeves, and lots of water (1 gallon per person per day in the summer). Hiking poles are a plus as are binoculars.","April 18, 2017",Major road construction closes rds. in park Sun-thurs nights from 7:00 p.m.-7:00 a.m. until Nov. 2017,596,"Austin, Texas",4
Arches National Park,"We had some car troubles and lost a day on our trip in Moab so got after a packed day in ANP to make up for lost time. Start early to get to experience the Park without the crowds!We got in the park at 6:30AM and did the Delicate Arch trail first. Got to the Arch about 7:30AM, no crowds, a bit windy (bring some light gloves to protect hands from wind burn) - only two other people were at the arch at that time, pretty rare to see without a crowd! If you're going to take pictures, the Arch is actually mostly in the shade during the morning sun - hence why it might be more crowded at sunset because the light hits the Arch more. This trail is very doable, there is a shorter incline part towards the beginning that is a little tough, but otherwise pretty doable for various fitness levels. This view is so worth it and way better than what you'll see from the other viewpoint options.We then did Devil's Garden Trail and also did the Primitive Trail section on our way back (this adds another mile), and really liked the different terrain of this part of the trail. Devil's Garden was a lot of fun - some light climbing, varying trails, and beautiful views.We then did the trails to see the Broken and Sand Dune Arches. Then we drove to the Windows Section, stopping kg at the viewpoints along the way, and did the trails to see the North, South, Turret, and Double Arches. We then drove back towards the beginning, where you can do the Park Avenue Trail.It was a full day and about 20 miles of hiking, but so worth it!

Wow, it's like ok let's drive as fast as we can to the next parking lot and not enjoy what's in between. I can't tell you how many time we pulled over, while driving the speed limit to let drivers go past. That being said, this National Park was incredible and built to perfection by Mother nature for thousands of years. What even made it more beautiful, was the back drop of snow capped mountains in the back ground. I'm guessing they were the Rocky Mountains.

Arches National Park,"This was my first time at Arches -- I had been to Zion & Bryce before, and recommend Arches as highly as Zion. Don't miss the Delicate Arch trail. Even though we came in early April, the parking lot to the trail was full -- we managed to find a sort-of-spot that was legal and didn't block anybody in. Some cars were parked in ways that prevented a space from being used by two cars, others parked illegally. I realize that building a bigger lot would cause crowding of the trail, but parking rules should be enforced or changed. At any rate, the DA trail provided an uplifting experience.","April 16, 2017",Wonderful experience,49,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Arches National Park,"Arches is everything the name promises. We enjoyed 2 days of hiking in the park and still didn't see all we wanted to see! A few of our favorite hikes: 1) Delicate Arch - this one is a must do! It is strenuous in parts because of the steepness of the climb, but it isn't technically difficult. If you go slow and take your time, just about anyone can do the hike. And it is totally worth it. Not only is the arch itself amazing but the view from up there is also breath taking. We hiked it at sunset and the colors were very nice. 2) We did the full hike to Double O and then down the primitive path. If I had it to do over, I would just go to Double O and turn back. I liked going out a different way than I came but it was easier to get lost and had no big advantage of the Double O Path. Double O is nice, but not for those who fear heights or can't hike the distance. 3) Off the path of the Double o there is a turnoff to see Navajo and Partition arches. We really liked these arches a lot and are definitely worth the extra effort to see them. In fact, I liked them better than double O.We hiked for about a day and a half and still missed seeing Windows and Double Arch - so definitely make sure you have a full 2 days to hike, but perhaps spread it across 3 to account for weariness and/or weather. More than any other NP in Utah, you need more time to feel like you have 'seen it all'.","April 16, 2017",Unique and beautiful landscape,91,"Dallas, Texas",5
Arches National Park,"Pack a couple of liters of ice water each day, even hiking in early spring. I hiked the Devils Garden and Delicate Arch trails during spring and the heat of summer, over 100 degrees. The arches of Utah are a worthwhile trip through millions of years of Earth's natural history.

Arches National Park,"Arches is a must see. The natural stone arches are scenic and plentiful. The park was established in 1929 and is in the high desert. It has speculator rock formations and over 2,000 natural stone arches and many soaring pinnacles and balanced rocks. Delicate Arch is the most popular Arch and Landscape Arch has the longest span (306 feet) of any arch in the US. The park has an abundance of trails for all. Its best to get there early as the road to the entrance is narrow and it leads to only two ranger booths. When we were there the park allowed us to enter without a fee because it expedited the traffic. Its also smart to beat the heat of the summer by arriving early as it gets to triple digits in the park and feels hotter because the rock radiates heat - bring plenty of water, sunscreen and wide brim hats and of course a camera. We were there in April and the hiking temp was a perfect 50 degrees. Imperative to stop at the Ranger Station and get the layout and maps of the hikes you are interested in and can comfortably navigate. We hiked to Delicate Arch which is 3 miles roundtrip, Sand Dune Arch and the Broken Arch Trail (1.3 miles roundtrip that we extended by 2 miles when we went thru the arch and went past Tapestry Arch thru the campground. We were in the Park for only one day but we could have easily visited for 2-3 days. For the adventurous plan on hiking The Fiery Furnace (is a labyrinth of narrow sandstone canyons that require agility to explore). FF is a fee area and was closed the day we were there and ranger led hikes there need advanced reservations. Arches is only a few miles north of Moab.

Arches National Park,"You have to want to come here given the distance from anything else and the expense of accommodations in Moab. However, the park is well worth the effort. We did not have a lot of time to explore, but many of the sites are very close to the road, so you can see a lot in a day. One disappointing thing was that the park was doing construction near the entrance, so it was closed from 7pm to 7am. For a photographer planning on sunrise and sunset pictures this was bad. ","April 14, 2017",Well worth the effort,27,"Richland, Washington",5
Arches National Park,"I honestly cannot say enough good things admit my trip to Arches. Incredible, challenging hikes on rock faces and trail levels to accommodate everyone. We hiked to landscape arch, continued to double o arch, to dark angel to primitive trail. Took us about 3.5 hrs and we stopped a few times. The weather was a beautiful 60 something degrees and got hotter around 11. Go during spring break to avoid the heat and crowds and GO EARLY like 8 am/9am because the park still gets crowded this time of year. Fierry Furnace is something we will have to plan in advance for. The tours were sold out and you cannot go without a guide. Next time! Also delicate arch was incredible and a tough uphill climb.

There were already people coming down when we finally made it to Delicate Arch. I think they are probably all stunning but we chose Delicate Arch because it was listed as a moderate hike. Moderate is probably an accurate description. My wife had to stop a bunch of times on the way up. We saw a lot of families of young and old so not to worry.

Highly recommend the Devil's Garden Trail. Has one short stretch that has you walking along a narrow ""fin"" with steep drop offs to either side so not for individuals who have a fear of heights (or who are bur are not equipped with walking sticks for balance assistance).

The temperatures are never too cold or too hot, so the longer hikes are relatively easy and you don't need to carry too much water. The other winter season benefit is that the Park is not crowded. Unlike spring, summer and fall, you'll rarely need to wait to enter the park, find a parking place, etc. Sightseeing and hiking is much more pleasant with only sounds are the natural sounds of the desert.

We headed to the Upper Delicate Arch lookout, which is a 5 to 10mins hike up a hill and had a good view of the arch on the other side of the valley. We decided to go off the beaten track on the rocks to get an even better view of the arch and weren't disappointed. We then drove to the Devil's Garden and stopped at Broken Arch on the way - WELL WORTH it! At Devil's Garden, we walked to Landscape Arch, then climbed the steep incline to start our hike to the Double O Arch and hiked the Primitive Loop; altogether took us 5 hrs. If you're scared of heights (like I am) you're better off climbing the steep incline next to Landscape Arch then hike the Primitive Loop rather than the other way round; coming down the steep incline would be scary!","April 12, 2017",The reason to visit Moab,60,"Melbourne, Australia",5

There are so many things to see that it is hard to do everything in 1 day. It is well worth doing some of the hikes to get to the different arches versus just seeing them from the viewing areas.

It has several viewpoints and you can choose to stop, based on your health conditions. I did the Primitive trail which is the longer and most difficult hike in Arches. It give you the beautiful loneliness sense and the opportunity to discover Private Arch and other amazing scenery.

Arches National Park,Arches is great!!! We can with young kids and we all loved it. We enjoyed the park avenue high which is somewhat strenuous if you come back up the trailhead closest to the park entrance. Other than that flat and fine!We enjoyed the windows and Double Arch hikes. Those were easy as well. Parking lot has an upper and lower lot with a hike up a staircase to get between the two hikes. This is a popular one so parking can be a bit of a problem.The hike to double o and landscape arches is great too. There are a few hills to go up and over but nothing too rough!Sandstone Arch is pretty cool. Pretty easy hike but it does get into some sandy spot so you might need to empty your shoes.Doing the Lower and Upper views of Delicate Arch really don't do it justice. Bite the bullet and hike it. There is some rough terrain and several inclines on rock faces and up the trail on the way there. Coming down is easier. The Arch does have a small cliff edge by it so watch children and those unsteady if you take them. Our 3 year old daughter went up on her own and did 3/4 the return trip. This after hiking 3 miles by herself previously the same day. So some little ones can do the hike on their own. It's a challenging hike but worth it to see the Arch at least once.Balanced rock was fun to see with a small loop hike. Many people have created tiny balanced rocks by it and that is fun to see also.,"April 8, 2017",Family Trip,33,,5

The Park Avenue trail gave a wonderfully different perspective on the 3 Gossips & Courthouse towers. Be sure not to skip Partition (my personal favorite), Navajo, Sand Dune or Broken arches.

It was very busy when we arrived about 1 p.m., but we were able to find parking spaces throughout the park, no problem. We stayed until about 4 p.m. and wanted to get out before the hoards of traffic came out. We visited Devil's Garden and many of the cool spots along the way.

Arches National Park,1st time to visit - a must see & well maintained. As a photographer I was blown away - absolutely gorgeous. Only problem was it was only opened at night on Fridays & Saturdays - due to road construction. It would have been nce to know this ahead of time. I heard there will be more closures of areas due to construction- which is necessary but will diminish visitors options and be very crowded as summer approaches. I still believe it is definitely worth a visit - an annual park pass really helps so you can go & visit it in sections - it is that awesome. For photographers - it lives up to it's reputation for having 'dark skies'!,"April 5, 2017",Amazing national treasure!,3,"Sacramento, California",5
Arches National Park,"Arches National Park is a relatively small park, but every inch of it is gloriously beautiful. Stand anywhere in Arches and turn in a circle, on every side there will be the most awe inspiring, profound views. It is also quite an accessible park, with many short, easy trails to prominent features. Park Avenue and Balance Rock can be enjoyed by driving up to the overlook and taking a few steps. The Windows and, my favorite, the Double Arch, required only a short, easy walk. Other features like the Delicate Arch are more strenuous but can be viewed from a distance. We spent the entire day in Arches and felt like there was lots more to see, or things worth seeing twice. This park reminds me of Zion National Park in many ways and is just as stunning. Of note, the parking in Arches has not been updated in many years and they do not have a shuttle service, so if you don't arrive early, it will be difficult to find parking at popular spots like the Delicate Arch trailhead.","April 5, 2017",A stunning national park,38,"Ottawa, Canada",5

Love the area around Double Arch and The Windows, and we went back during sunset which was really, really nice, and not crowded, which surprised me since the park was closing on Sun-Thurs at 7 pm for road work. Love the hike to Landscape Arch, the area around Sand Dune and Broken Arch, and Delicate Arch. Hope one day to return and do the Fiery Furnace hike. The views at different points in the park are so photogenic that it's hard to stop taking pictures. I've heard there are times it gets so crowded it's hard to find a place to park.

The bathrooms are nice and clean and there were plenty of places to picnic and ditch your trash. There are no food services so you will have to pack your meals. There are also water stations to fill up your water bottles. The park gets crowded early and the parking lot of Delicate Arch get filled up early and pretty much stays filled up. If you can’t make it to Delicate Arch, then try again because it’s worth the hike! You can expect road congestion at Balanced Rock also and it’s easy to get to.

You can easily just show up and still have an amazing experience but I find knowing my limitations and planning accordingly worked well on this trip. We were able to stick to some of the easier hikes and do the scenic drives and still feel as though we had a full and enriching park experience.It was very hot during the day time and not much tree cover around so be sure to bring plenty of water. Stay on the trails and take your time. We planned for a day at Arches but easily could have done a longer trip.

In early morning, around the sunrise, I saw few rabbits and few deers walking near the trail. During the driving in the park, be careful. There is many wild animals trying to cross the road, especially between the sunset and the sunrise. Bring the good hiking shoes if you want to go deeper, not to stay only on the overlooks. In some areas rocks are loose and you have to protect your feet and ankles.This is “must see” attraction and I recommend this place! If you planning to visit more national parks or come back to the Arches, I recommend to purchase the annual pass which costs $80 (as of March 2017). It gives you a freedom as far as number of comebacks to the Arches park. You will not be able to well explore this awesome place during one day. Between Thursdays and Sundays you can stay there overnight.Devil's Garden is another area of the Arches park where you can enjoy the beauty of the rock formations and many arches. This place requires a little bit more experience of the hikers. Especially if you pick the primitive trail to go back to the start point.

I was with my husband and 2 kiddos (ages 13 and 11) and we did the seven mile loop around Devils Garden. The paved trails to the first few arches were easy to navigate, but once you commit to the primitive trail, be prepared for some serious climbing and navigating. There are some special cliffs that make perfect spots to stop and have lunch, but keep an eye on the cairns (rock piles that mark the trail) to lead you out because signage is sparse.

The guided hikes in Fiery Furnace dont start until May, so that was a bit disappointing. Still did the hike, but did not venture far within after they scare you so much before you go. We went to most of the overlooks over the course of a few days and also hiked to Delicate Arch, Windows hike, and Devils Garden area hike to Landscape only.

Many people had young children with them but I wouldn't recommend it. One slip and down they go. Currently the park closes at 7pm due to construction so we were not able to stay in the park to view delicate arch at night. The other arches at the end of the scenic rd have a couple of hikes.

Arches National Park,"My husband and I spent a day and a half in Arches National Park. We arrived late in the afternoon and hiked to the north and south windows and also to the double arch. We then enjoyed the sunset views over Balanced rock. The next morning we arrived fairly early (9am) and hiked to Delicate Arch. There were quite a few people (lots of young people and families) but I am quite sure it would get busier later in the day. The hike was not too difficult but since I am scared of heights it was a bit scary at the end where you have to walk along an edge which is about 3-4' wide. The views at the end of this hike of this incredibly huge Arch are fantastic. Lots of people walk down under the Arch for photos. Everyone takes turns. I suspect this would also be a good site at sunset. After this hike we hiked out to Landscape Arch and a few others in the area. Arches is a very accessible park. Other than Delicate Arch and perhaps Landscape you can walk to many of the Arches within a few minutes of your parked car.Pack a lunch, some snacks and lots of water and spend at least one full day in this wonderful park... so worth it!","March 20, 2017",Beautiful and accessible National Park,33,"North Vancouver, Canada",5

We were able to visit the park during March, right before college's spring break so it was a perfect time visit. Not too hot and not too crowded. The parking for the trails did fill up quickly but if you plan on doing Delicate Arch first thing in the morning, it isn't too hard to find a spot to park. Road construction is supposed to begin this summer (2017) on the roads within the park so this may affect which areas are open depending on when you go. There are plenty of hikes within the park, some harder than others...I would consult your park map, smartphone (although phone service is spotty in the park), or ask the ranger before you go if you have questions. There are flush toilets at the visitors center but no toilets with running water at the trail head toilets so plan accordingly. Also remember to bring with you plenty of water, sunscreen, and a hat, since it can get hot under the desert sun. ","March 19, 2017",Land of 200 Arches,15,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

Arches National Park,"Of course this place is a natural wonder--but we had to get away from the maddening crowds to enjoy it. The biggest disappointment was Delicate Arch--a 45 minute walk, only to find a constant parade of people getting their pics taken under the arch--so much so that it was impossible to just get a photo of the arch itself without ""look at me"" in the frame. Yes, it was spring break and yes, 9 a.m.--but still frustrating. Highlights were walks to less-famous arches, where one could nearly be by oneself. Tower Arch (20 min drive down a dirt road, then 45 min hike) was very nice. As were Sand Dune Arch and Skyline Arch. On another note, the Visitor Center, located at the entrance to the park, is open from 9-4--making it impossible for early comers and late-stayers to actually ""visit"" the Visitor Center. And this summer they close the whole park at 7 p.m. to let construction crews in--meaning you have to be out before the sun sets--limiting photo ops at this prime time of day. And with campground closed, we needed to go 20 miles to a BLM campground to find a spot. (Camp at Fisher Towers if you can--no spaces left when we got there, but very nice spot with great hiking option right there on site.) We left Arches early due to all of the above--and caught the sunset at Canyonlands Island in the Sky area, at an overlook of the Green River--very nice!","March 19, 2017",Get off the beaten path,13,"Blue Ridge, Virginia",4

Arches National Park,"This is one of the most crowded national parks we've ever been to, and we live next to Yellowstone. Parking is limited and I can't imagine what it is like here in peak season. We took one of the last spots at Devil's Garden. Trails were crowded. Staff at the visitor center were not very friendly and a little condescending. We wanted a ranger tour of the Fiery Furnace, but they don't start them until April. They do have permits available, but it would be rather foolish to wander around in there without a guide or some knowledge about wayfinding in slot canyons. We have none of that, so we skipped it. We took a guided off road tour to Tower Arch, which was the highlight of our trip. We were the only ones there, even though you can drive the dirt road in a low clearance vehicle. I can see where it would be easy to get lost and end up on a 4WD only road, so pay attention to the signs and take a map. The park closes at 7 pm until November this year for road construction, so plan on getting out early or taking one of the 4WD roads to get out (this is what we did -- sunset was incredible).

Arches National Park,"We arrived at 2pm in the afternoon coming straight from the airport. Many arches and amazing scenery are visible while driving through the park in the comfort of your vehicle. Also, it is a fairly small park and doesn't take too long to get to the end. There are also just 2 roads that go off the main road so you can't really get lost. Our priority was to hike to Delicate Arch and then see how much time we had left before we lost daylight. We were able to visit 4 other arches making us feel that we got a good park experience. Of course we could have spent more time hiking and exploring, but at least we didn't feel like we had ""barely scratched the surface"" at the end of the day! Bring water and snacks and think about your restroom stops since there are only a few locations.","March 17, 2017",This park is doable in a day if you are in a hurry,319,"Frisco, Texas",4

The time of day, season, and weather make each arch a separate gem. Beware, the summers are scorchers. Take way more water than you think you can drink, good shoes, sun protection, lip balm and a sense of humor. The sand gets everywhere you don't want sand.","March 16, 2017",Do see,135,"Grand Junction, Colorado",5
Arches National Park,This is the second trip back to the Park. The weather was perfect for hiking. High 40's and bright sun!! Not nearly as crowed as the summer and not as hot. There are so many natural arches throughout the park. Take plenty of water and food and of course a big SD photo card for your camera. Do this park in the afternoon to the evening because the sun setting on the arches will offer many photo opportunities. Do the Canyonlands Park in the morning to watch the sunrise - again much better photo opportunities. The long hike up to the Delicate Arch is soooo worth it. Takes about an hour or so (if in good shape) to hike up to the arch.,"March 16, 2017",The Arches National Park is unbelievable.,30,"Canton, Ohio",5
Arches National Park,The initial drive to get into the park wasn't too great but once you get up the hill and get up top it's views in every direction.

Arches National Park,"If you are coming to visit Moab and don't visit Arches what are you thinking? This and Canyonlands National Park are why thousands come from around the world each year to Moab. Natural wonders that just can't be missed. A must is the hike to Delicate Arch. Take water! I don't care if you visit in the spring or late fall Utah the most arid state in the United States. You have to drink water here as the moisture is sucked from you body merely by breathing. The hike up and back is also a couple of miles and uphill to the Arch so you will be exerting yourself. You need in be I shape to do this hike especially in the heat of the summer. Also leather soul shoes are a bad idea as you will be walking on slick rock. Again, what are you thinking? Wear hiking boots or sneakers so you have traction. ","March 14, 2017",What are you thinking?,7,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

Arches National Park,"We were skiing in SLC and with a temp warm up decided to take an adventure day away. The scheduled 3 1/2 to 4 hour drive to Arches seemed like a lot of time to spend on the road but as we like to say ""you gotta be somewhere"" so we left at about 7 AM and headed south. The drive was enjoyable. Good roads - lots of passing zones on the two lane stretches through beautiful mountain desert vistas. Be sure to keep your gas tank full. Service stations are few and far between. (We had to back track 10 miles to civilization on our return trip and glad we did - no gas for 60 miles if we kept going. Don't think there's gas at the next crossroads). Also, pack your lunch and water. Not many choices along the way. Arches has a nice welcome center with helpful rangers, exhibits and gift shop. Load up your water at spigot. We toured in early March and couldn't have picked a better day. Temps in low 79s with low crowds. Can't imagine the busy season. The parking area signs said only park in designated areas. In early March most were used but we always found a spot. Again, can't imagine busier time. Once on the 30 mph road way it was awe and wonder! Every turn brought spectacular, inspiring views of naturally carved sandstone sculptures. We stopped at most every turn out to photograph the landscapes. Glad to see so many big cameras out and few iPhones. That speaks to the magnificence of sights being captured for their beauty. We rented the MP3 narration tour ($25 down with $20 refund on return at the gift shop. Not bad, a few stories and explanations but nothing we couldn't have picked up from a brochure and extra study. Probably worth it. Our time allowed us all the stops up to the lower parking area view of Delicate Arch. We had to save all the northern Arches for another visit. We spent about 3 1/2- 4 hours in the park and visitor center. ( 15 minute film was good). We want to hit the other Utah parks on future trips and will again shoot for March. The long trip back brought beautiful views of the backside of our morning journey. Books on tape entertained the pleasant drive back to SLC in time for dinner out. While I was in a medically weekend state due to some heavy meds I managed a slow pace on a few short walks. The grades were not bad from the parking lots and steps were wide and gradual. All in all a perfect day at the park. It's a good trek there but so glad we went and spent a 12 hour day of adventure to a most wondrous place. ","March 11, 2017",Wow!

The time of day changes the colors of the formations from sunrise to sunset. Go to info station in middle of town for maps and list of what to see, they're very helpful. We didn't take our Jeep out there and still got to visit a majority of the rock formations. Very good back roads, take plenty of water. Just go!","March 11, 2017",Wow!

Arches National Park,"OK, so the state of Utah, in it's infinite wisdom, went with the ""if you market it (without building it's infrastructure to handle it) they WILL COME."" In droves and without management, expecting everything. And so they did, to the point where there long lines at the entrance to Arches is the rule not the exception. And the hike to Delicate Arch is burgeoning with - as I like to say ""cowboy boots and baby strollers."" Plan your trip in the times when LESS people are there. At this point, Moab has no ""off season"" (that again is the Utah Marketing "" Moab - year round adventure""). But December is going to be less crowded than May. Here's the best tip I have for seeing these popular parks: get up early. One primary reason not to do this: you're lazy. OK, well then get in the long line with the other lazy people. For you NON-lazy people --Get to the Arches entrance at 6 am and see the park while others are still sleeping. Morning hikes in the cool desert air are amazing. Photos are way better. It feels like a wilderness when you have an empty trail in front of you and silence. You have more time in the day to get out to other places and your 4 hour tour of the park is done by 10 or 11 am. Get on the road - travel to the next place and do it all over again.Ask park rangers about the ""best unpopular hikes to do"" - they love sharing the less-traveled gems in their park.Pack a nice little snack on the bumper of the car and take it down the trail for 20 minutes and enjoy it in the beauty of the park, not the diesel in the parking lot.

We turned back before Double O Arch as we were worried about being blown off the top of one of the fins the path seemed to go along, and we couldn't see an easy way to climb down the other side (or rather back up again), where we could see a trail below. The walk up to Delicate Arch was good too. Again we chickened out from staying to watch the sunset for fear of returning along the narrow track with steep drop off in the dusk and gusty wind.

My wife and I spent close to two days in the place and we really enjoyed and savored the awesome scenery in the place. We spent a lot of time walking and hiking. While we missed to get nor complete our hike to the Double O arch and the road to Delicate arch was closed (we did not hike there), the other arches such as the Landscape arch, the San Dune arch, the Double arch, the Fiery Furnace and other views were just awesome and breathtaking. One can't miss to appreciate God's creation and God's presence when one is in this place, the science behind it notwithstanding.If we are ever near Moab again, we would go back to Arches again.I just thought that more safety signs be provided and placed as there are some risks and safety concerns in some locations during the hike, especially to the Double O arch.

Arches National Park,"The first time we visited Utah in 2008, we were already impressed with the numbers of national parks the state had, one next to the others.This state is a gem for natural lovers and adventurers with Arches, Canyonlands, Bryce Canyon, Zion, Capitol Reef, Grand Staircase-Escalante and many others. Each of the parks is a natural wonder with its uniqueness and beauty. This past June-July we did a long road trip to let our kids visit many wonderful places we had been to before having them, one of them is Arches. Even years went by and we have seen more and more, Arches is still one of the best national parks in our list. Arches has a landscape of contrasting colors, landforms and textures unlike any other in the world with the world's largest concentration of natural sandstone arches (+2000 arches). They are always beautiful sights to see no matter how many times you visit. They are stunning no matter what time of the day you visit, during sunrises, mid-day, sunsets, and or under the moonlight. We visited Arches in summer only (both times) so the weather was quite harsh (hot, - + 100 degree F, dry, no shade). Visiting Arches requires hiking, from short, easy hikes (+- 20 minutes) to much longer (few hours or half day). You can't avoid hiking here so coming well prepared with water and snacks and extra time for resting while hiking. Our kids (4 and 6) could do up to 7 miles hiking a day under extremely unpleasant conditions of summer, you can too :) Arches is a must see place on your list!","February 11, 2017",One of the Best National Parks,211,"Fresno, California",5

Arches National Park,"I think it goes without saying that a trip to Moab would be incomplete without a visit of Arches. This was one of the most accessible parks, with the majority of the attractions visible from parking your car and walking around a mile radius. Our family is not big on hiking, so this was perfect for us as we were able to get a map from the visitor center, and follow the road to the places we wanted to see. Along the way, there are so many incredible stops with many photo opportunities. A picture outside of South Arch is actually on the back of our Christmas card! Although it gets pretty hot in the summer, visiting just a couple hours before sunset will be the optimal time to avoid the scorching heat. Also, if you decide to travel by car, you'll have the luxury of being able to bring a cooler of drinks and have air conditioning while driving from one attraction to another.

Be sure to take your phone or camera for photos you will always treasure. Hope to return again and do more hiking and spend a couple of days there and at nearby Canyonlands. Check out the Senior Discount Rates available for National Parks. Be sure to watch the quick video at the Visitor Center to get a good overview of the park at the start of your visit.

I only make this point for people who may be visiting for the first time.There are many other roadside pull offs with short and long trails.

Delicate Arch is about an hour hike and recommended to have proper shoes. It's not an easy hike and contains inclines may not be best for little ones. Definitely worth it however.

Arches National Park,"Arches National Park is, essentially right at the edge of town from Moab. The sandstone formations are fascinating in their beauty: arches, fins (long, narrow formations), balanced rocks, and more. They can be seen easily from the car, and there are many paved ""pull out spots"" that allow stopping and studying the formations. For those who are not mobility challenged, there are many hiking trails, but it's wonderful for the less active to be able to see the variety of the sights without needing to do more than take a few steps from the car, or even by staying in the car. It's possible to drive the route in 2 to 3 hours, and there is a movie explaining the geology of the area in the visitor area, which is very, very close to the entrance. The entrance fee is $25.00 per car (seniors are eligible for the lifetime national park pass for a total cost of $10.00. and having a senior with a pass in the car means there is no additional charge to admit the car, no matter how many people are in the car).","December 29, 2016",Absolutely Beautiful and Very Accessible,97,Sun City West,5

Arches National Park," Wife and I have traveled all over the southwest and we love it. We still have not seen all the national parks and subsequent state parks. But this trip brought us to Arches National Park. We were there at the end of July which means it's hot, and I mean sauna hot. Daily highs up to 113 degress were the norm. Plan accordingly for the day, rangers were recommending 1 gallon per person per day. Start your day at sunrise since it gets so hot so fast. Hike and see the arches till noon and take a full siesta till the evening. Delicate Arch is the most popular at Arches, about a 45 min hike over some slightly rough terrain. This is an excellent vantage point in the park, probably one of the best. Landscape Arch is a nice overall easy hike but looks more impressive in pics. There are up to 2k arches in the park but only a few are readily accessible. Bathrooms throughout the park are the glorified port a toilet so some may want to pack wipes. Full scale bathrooms are at the main park entrance. Dont forget to check out wall street and other formations which are on the way up the steep grade into the park.  Dead Horse State Park is worth a look as well as Canyonlands National Park, Island in the Sky district. They are practically across the street from Arches. The following we didn't figure out till the end of our trip so take this advice to get ur most sites per day factor. Stay in Moab of course, start ur day at Arches, transfering to Dead Horse State Park or Island in the Sky in Canyonlands after lunch. Dead Horse and Islands are about a 1k higher in elevation than Arches which means the temp is usually 10 to 12 degress lower, much more bearable. Island in the Sky is also the only district in Canyonlands that has paved roads. Finally Mesa Arch in Canyonlands is a very popular sunrise spot for pics of the arch. Just keep in mind there are busloads of foreign tourists jockeying for the perfect picture spot. The glorified port a cans will be practically overflowing when everyone leaves so go back to ranger station or keep driving deeper into the park for more facilities.  Moab is a small town with your usuall fast food fair. The local brewery resturant was decent. Something we've noticed in touristy areas is some resturants will automatically add in the tip, so be advised. Book rooms ASAP since summer is peak time.

We did only a few short hikes/walks due to the cold, but there is a great deal you can see without extensive walking. One other reason to go this time of year is if you travel with pets - it would be waaaay too hot and unsafe to leave them in the car other times of the year, and dogs are only allowed on leash in parking lots/roads so you can't take them to viewpoints or any hikes. In winter this is not an issue and pets can stay 20-30 minutes in the care while you photograph or visit a viewpoint.

Arches National Park,"Delicate Arch hike I give this hike one star only to warn people of the possible danger involved. I hiked this with my family of five- ages 38 to 66. Although the hike to delicate arch is short it is very much uphill and strenuous. Once you make it up the strenuous hill there is a ledge that is is exposed but wide. Then when you reach the arch area there is a rock wall that I would recommend you sit on to view the arch. Many people including our group went over the wall and sat on a ""bowl"" wall to view the sunset. One person in our group mentioned how nervous the ""bowl"" made him so we all stayed sitting as apposed to wandering closer to the arch or moving about in general. Unfortunately before the sunset we witnessed a woman who was moving about and either tripped or lost her footing and she fell face first down into the bowl hitting the rock several times on her way down. She suffered severe injuries including broken limbs and head injuries. We haven't been able to find any follow up info on her well being but we know she was life flighted out of the area and it is very likely that she did not survive.

Arches National Park, This is my third visit in arches NP and first time in nov and with my family(their first time) and it sure is more comfortable and less crowded than any other months. Im still in awe of arches NP and will probably never get tired of visiting it. it features the most unique rocks and arches hence the name. This place offers from the simplest to the most challenging hikes and you'll be rewarded with the views even when youre looking out from your car.  We also got to see some rock climbers during our trip.  Delicate arch is my favorite and a must..first time to hike in the dark too after sunset. (As if the trail wasnt challenging enough ) but the good thing was we were able to go with some hikers and a number of photographers were just hiking up for the night photography. Arches is a place for everyone...dont forget to bring water. ,"December 11, 2016",A treasure,2,"Sicklerville, New Jersey",5

We had all the weather, sun, sandstorm, cold and snow. Be prepared. We made one big mistake in that we lost the trail to the Double O arch and ended up down in a valley towards the primitive trail. There were still markers about so it was ages before we realised and once we gave up trying to get back up the way we came, we realised that the primitive trail up towards the Double O arch was too scary for us. In the heat of summer we might have been in trouble but it was fine on this cooler day. The whole place is amazing and otherworldly and it is accessible for all abilities.

Plus we did a small walk to the lower delicate arch viewpoint. Plenty of beautiful viewpoints well marked and accessible from the road. Could have done with more places to sit and rest along the trails.Parking at some of the more popular sites was barely adequate even in October.

The tour buses stat rolling in around 8:00 am. The park gets crowded quickly so make sure you have a plan and hit all the arches you want to see. The NPS provides great maps/brouchures at the entrance. These were really helpful in planning out the day and our hikes.

We continued along the loop into the La Sal mountains which was beautiful, however make sure the weather is good and you get out before dark. The elevation is quite high and roads are narrow.

I went very early and I was glad that I did, as the park was very crowded when I was on my way out. The trail has some of the best views in the park, especially Partition Arch. You can just hike up the Double O trail from Landscape Arch to see 3 arches (Navajo, Partition, and Double O) and then go back the way you came. I did the whole loop, which was lovely and quiet. The trail gets hard to follow if you don't keep an eye out for the trail markers and does involve scrambling and walking through washes (so check the weather before you go), but it was a great hike.

Arches National Park,"I can't comprehend how anyone can give less than five star reviews of any national park, after all, it's the nature that we're there for. Some places may appeal to us more than others, but they're all wonderful places.Arches has an unreal quality that will truly amaze anyone who hasn't spent any time in the American Southwest. I've seen a lot and still felt in awe. The great quality Arches has is the ability to easily put you on a hiking trail and get you out with nature no matter how young or old you are. There are plenty of manageable hikes. My wife and I are in horrible shape and we did over three miles of trails on our day in the park.The non-summer months are great. The sun is lower in the sky and it makes for great pictures. Morning hours are best for many of the sights. And I think the Windows spur is the best stretch in the park.My suggestion:1. Start early and drive to the end and hike at Devils Garden. The trail is very manageable to Landscape Arch, then come back and hit the Pine Tree Arch and Tunnel Arch, which are spurs off the main trail.2. Park at Sand Dune Arch and hit that and then hike over to Broken Arch, which was a nice, fun jaunt.3. Hit all the pullouts on the way back and do all the short walks.4. Go to the Windows Arch area and hike out to those.5. In the afternoon hike out to Delicate Arch if you can manage it, otherwise, just go to the viewpoint.I'd love to get in better shape and do the full hike out to Devils Garden. It looked like fun.

Arches National Park,"Don't try to rush a trip in here and for sure, if it's during summer, bring lots of water with you because it gets HOT on all those rocks. That being said, there is plenty to see and do here, most often by simply looking for the signs on the side of the road and pulling off when you want to see something that interests you. Parking is usually available too. There are longer hikes for the more adventurous, but we decided to do those another time, when it is cooler. We'd like to come back so hope we can in the next couple of years. Either way, walking up to several of these arches and seeing them up close is a cool experience you won't forget any time soon.

Arches National Park,"My first trip to Arches was back in the mid 70's and I've been going back every chance I get. Aside from being one of the most beautiful Nat. Parks, Arches is unique in that you can see many of the main attractions with a short hike from a parking area. Some are even visible from the road, but you have to stop and let the grandeur of the park soak in. The most famous thing is of course, Delicate Arch. It is inspiring to look at and you can't help but wonder how long it's taken to achieve its current level of perfection. The hike from the trail head to the arch is easy for young folks, and certainly ""do-able"" for older folks like me. Take a couple of bottles of water as there is nothing along the way (and there shouldn't be) in case you get hot and thirsty. Delicate Arch is like the Northern Lights, pictures cannot do them justice.

And the park was outstanding! We had our puppy with us, so if there were no hikes that we were able to do with him, But we were able to drive around the park and get off at scenic overlooks. It was definitely worth the drive! I would put it on a list of the top five national parks that we've been to so far, and we have been to quite a few! Next stop, Zion state park.

Arches National Park,"My husband and I are on a mission to see all the national parks. While this one isn't our favorite, it was pretty cool. We arrived right at 8am but there was no one manning the entrance station so we drove straight in. After a quick trip to the visitor center, we took off into the park. It was COLD, around freezing, with a brutal wind. Take appropriate head and hand gear.We began by driving to Balanced Rock, .3 mile walk around the rock. Then we went to Windows where we walked the loop/primitive trail of 1 mile. Beware, the primitive trail has semi narrow paths, so be careful. After that we went to Double Arch, .5 miles, where we came face to face with deer eating from the brush. It was fantastic. Next was Delicate Arch, 3 miles. It was steeper than we envisioned and was incredibly crowded. I must say, it wasn't my favorite Arch (that was Turret Arch in Windows). We drove to the Fiery Furnace where we ate a quick lunch, then on to Devil's Garden trailhead. We walked the primitive trail, so a total of 7.3ish miles. The primitive trail is NO joke. At parts, we had to stop and look for cairns. They're there, you just have to find them. It's easy to get off trail so keep your head up. Also, if you're afraid of heights, you may not want to do this one. There is some scrambling in high spots. If not, go for it! You won't regret it.We left the park around 2:30. There was a huge line to get into the park as we drove out. It's a $25 entry fee, and the visitors center is open from 8-4:30.","November 20, 2016",Great Hikes with Awesome Views,119,"Knoxville, Tennessee",4
Arches National Park,"I spent 3 nights here. It was not enough. I would recommend at least 5 unless you are one of those young fit speedy Gonzales. The view points alone will take a day and there are so many trials to hike. Many of the trials involves rock climbing so you have to be at some level of fitness to tackle them. I would strongly recommend staying at the campsite (Devil's Garden). It cost $25 a night and if you have a senior card, $12.50. Have the right change as the host does not carry change. It is a walk- in only campsite which is great because it would be fully booked all the time otherwise. Best time to check in is around 8 to 9 because I notice that most people check out early if they were leaving. The campsite alone is a great place to hike. There is an arch by the amphitheater and a trail and rock formation within the campsite itself. A herd of 6 deer roamed through my site one morning. The campsite is in Devil's Garden which has a few trails and arches and that would take a day of hiking. The other popular trails are Delicate Arch (an icon), total 6 miles to and from the parking lot, Fiery Furnace (require permit), Klondike Bluff (about 4 mile drive on a dirt road to the trail head) and many others. Just driving around the park on the paved road give you some great views of the various rock formations in the park. It took me 2 days to drive from my home to the park but the trip was definitely worth it.","November 19, 2016",Nothing short of amazing,121,"Phoenix, Arizona, United States",5

Arches National Park,"Stopped here for a day on a cross country road trip where we were hitting several other NP's on the way. This was one of our favorites! Our annual pass got us right in and immediately you are driving up switchbacks and admiring the amazing rocks! The road is in great shape and there are many cool sites to stop and see along the drive through the park. We stopped to hike Delicate Arch which is a must do...this is the most prominent arch in the park and is the one featured on many advertisements for the park. The hike was fairly short and not too strenuous and brings you right to the arch where you can take a ton of photos from many different angles. Our only issue were the really annoying people who thought they were the only ones taking photos...they wouldn't get out of the shot so most of our photos have the couple standing at the bottom of the arch taking endless selfies. Anyway, that didn't take away from our awesome experience. You have to take a few minutes to sit there and enjoy the beauty and magnificence of this arch...it is just amazing. After hiking out we drove to the end of the park and did another small hike to a few other arches before heading back out of the park. We spent about 6 hours in the park which was plenty. If we had more time we would have spent a few more hours on some of the other hikes to various arches. We'll just have to go back again to get those hikes in!

It is difficult in spots if you are not used to the elevation (my father-in-law was not!) and there are some long uphill areas that will test those who are not in shape or having a hard time with the elevation. The reward for sticking it out though is great! Pace yourself and take water with you.

Arches National Park,"Devil's Garden Loop Trail at Arches: Early on this trail you will encounter what's probably the most challenging climb until the end of the trail at Double O arch. I don’t remember the name of the section, but you will know it when you come upon it. It’s steep upward. If you successfully make the short climb up the rock, and you should if you are moderately fit and moderately confident, the rest of the trail up until the Primitive Loop will be doable for you. Now a word about the Primitive Loop which is a trail option to return to the parking lot.Mostly the Primitive Trail is doable for people who have made it as far as the trail head to Dark Horse trailhead. Mostly. HOWEVER, there are a couple of sections you need to know about. You’ll come across a boulder that is a steep slide downward. At this first challenge, many, many hikers turn around and return via the main trail. There is no shame to turn back before trying this. It was happenstance that Hans, a German-American who grew up hiking the Alps (Hans, yes, really!), was there with Susan, his wife, at the same time. He coached us on how to slide down a 10-foot drop on your butt and back over a steep face. Once you’ve done it, you realize that physics and friction make it only a moderate challenge for a fit, confident hiker with no experience doing this. This boulder can be climbed back upward if you decide to turn back before the second challenge coming up. We met several people who had come up it: one couple who were moderately experienced, another a family with little experience who were doing the Primitive Trail in reverse, that is, starting near the parking lot. More on the family at the end.The second challenging spot comes soon after the first. There is another downward boulder slide which again looks impossible, ending on a ledge about a foot wide, the ledge located on a cliff face about 15-feet from the bottom where the trail resumes. The slide seemed to be a shorter height distance, but slightly steeper. That landing ledge looks too narrow to stop a downward butt-back-slide. Obviously by the scratch markings in the boulder face, many people have successfully made this slide. And stopped. After making this second slide, I met another couple of hikers who didn’t want to do the next immediate challenge—traversing a steep boulder face for about 10-feet long with no apparent footholds or handholds. This traverse starts at the small ledge you just landed on. This couple went back up that second slide and up that first slide to return along the main trail (I heard their story back when back in the parking lot). My wife chose to traverse the boulder face before me after watching three experienced rock scramblers make it look feasible. There are nearly invisible handholds and footholds that you will see as you hug the boulder. And you can slightly grab into micro cracks. Unfortunately, she slid off the footholds just two steps into crossing the face. Every attempt for her to recover footing made her slip further down the face. My heart stopped. Again fortunately for us, Hans, came back and shouted encouragement and coached from 15-feet below, and a young woman who had just crossed the face ran back and grabbed ahold of my wife’s free hand. Hans and the young woman quickly coached (my wife was slipping further every second) and then yanked her across the face. I don’t scare easily. Those moments were absolutely terrifying.Later while dissecting that face crossing we found that her shoes—old running shoes—had worn flat in several areas where they hardened slick. That was our huge mistake. We’re fit, we’re confident, but some of our equipment was crap. After that ledge, the rest of the Primitive Loop trail was relatively easy downhill going. We once caught up with Hans and Susan. She said the warnings in the trail literature for that trail don’t use strong enough warnings for that type of hiking. She said it should warn that you ought to be an experienced rock scrambler before attempting that trail. Maybe not expert, but experienced.The family? Mom, Dad, and two girls, one looked to be eight years old, the other looked to be about twelve. They did the entire Devil’s Garden Loop in reverse, starting at the Primitive Loop where it ends near the parking lot. Dad seemed experienced, the rest seemed to be new to this. We first met them as we neared that first boulder slide. They had already traversed the ledge and climbed up both faces of the boulder slides. Dad gave us some tips, Mom seemed emotionally tired, and the girls were quiet. We didn’t fully realize what they had just experienced. Dad said the rock face climbing was challenging, but doable. We talked again later when we met on trail near the parking lot. Dad told us how proud he was of the youngsters, but that the ledge was so terrifying that after they traversed it, then climbed up off the narrow ledge and over that steep boulder face, the older girl sat down and cried. I could have done the same! ","November 5, 2016","Has Challenging, Ultimately Rewarding Hiking, But Warning",5,San Diego,5

The arch at the beginning of the trail (photo provided) was the best arch. The vistas of the park were amazing. The out and back is only about 4.5 miles, although you could lengthen it by taking the Primitive Trail either out or back. I hate ledges and drop offs, so I took the crevice route in lieu of the first fin up near the trail entrance. Most people, however, have no problem with walking the fin.

Arches National Park,"Arches National Park is very popular because of the dramatic red rock formations and famous arches. It's only 27 miles from I-70, and compared to other parks, you can see a lot of interesting and exciting sights and desert scenery within a relatively small area. The scenic drive access road to all the features is only about 53 miles round trip. The park can get very crowded and parking spaces fill up. It is best to try to get to the park early and visit the most popular areas first. Try to avoid weekends and holidays. This strategy worked for us; we visited the last week of August and arrived at the park at sunrise. We drove all the way through to Devil's Garden and took a short hike, then stopped at all the features on our way back out. It was starting to get crowded and tour buses were appearing by about 9:30-10:00. We had been to the park before and didn't need a permit for anything, so we waited to stop at the visitor center on our way out. You can get a map with basic geological information about the park at the entrance kiosk where you pay the admission ($25/car, accepts NPS passes). Allow about half a day to see everything - longer if you are going to do some hikes. If you don't have a lot of time, I suggest visiting ""Park Avenue"" and ""The Windows"" as you can see some amazing sights near the road/parking without long hikes. People who use wheelchairs or have serious mobility limitations will not be able to access many of the trails, but fortunately some features can be seen from a car or viewpoint so it's still worth visiting. There is no lodge or restaurant at this park, but it is located just outside the town of Moab, which has all the services you will need. Just bring along some snacks and water. There's a campground in the park at Devil's Garden, visit the park website for information about that. I highly recommend that you take the time to visit Canyonlands National Park as well while you're in the area, and take a scenic drive along the Colorado River on UT128 for more amazing scenery.","November 2, 2016",Amazing Sights Attract Crowds of Admirers,1781,"Tucson, Arizona",5

There was a line going into the park at the entrance and a ranger walks along the line of cars to divert those with national park passes to another line to ease congestion. We waited only 5 minutes. The rangers in the visitor center were very helpful and knowledgeable with trail and other questions. In front of the visitor center there is a place to fill up your water bottle with drinking water. It is a ""one-main-road"" kind of park so not very big, but there is enough to keep you busy for 2-3 days if you want to hike. Delicate Arch and Double O Arch area plus visitor center can be done in one day if short on time.","October 29, 2016",Very Organized Park,36,California,5

Arches National Park,"We had always heard so much about Arches and were thrilled to finally make it...due to a time crunch, we were only able to make it out to Delicate Arch and back but we really enjoyed the short hikes out to view DA and its 'sister' formations (we thought that the 1 mile RT hike to view from afar was a much cooler view than being right 'in' them (use 2nd parking lot at DA for this hike)...and the short hike to/from Turret Arch (SOOO much bigger than you can imagine when looking from afar), but what an adventure! Every turn along the road within the park provides awe-inspiring views and great discussion fodder with your travel mates about 'what it looks like'. Don't miss Arches if you are ANYwhere in the vicinity of Moab...it's amazing...and hopefully you can do both Arches AND Canyonland because they are both don't miss experiences...","October 29, 2016","Beautiful job, Mother Nature!",7,"San Jose, CA",5

However, make Arches Viewpoint to be your first hike and do the Fiery Furnace hike.Some tips before you hike: wear hiking boots, bring a hat, walking poles, water, snacks, your camera & tripod and sunscreen.

Nothing compares to the incredible landscape and the hiking is some of the best you will ever experience. We spent 2 full days here, which I think is the minimum you should spend if you really want to have time to do some of the signature hikes. Be sure to have at least one sunrise or sunset at the park too. Moab is a fun place to stay and very convenient to the park.

Young people wouldn't think twice about walk, but most of it was upward. Take your time and have plenty of water. Hat too. Maybe take a treat to have once you are up there. Plenty of water! I said that twice for a reason, we saw so many that didn't have any water with them. I wouldn't have made it if I didn't have any water. In fact, we each had a regular bottle. I would take an extra one and a couple of bars or fruit to eat once you are at the arch. We also walked to the Windows Arches.

My favorite hike was to the Dlicate Ach which was fun and beautiful. Make sure you take water with you on that hike. Windows Arch was also pretty cool. There was another arch, I can't remember the name, but would be great for children as it was amidst a beach of sand and was very shady.","October 28, 2016",Beautiful!,27,"Springboro, Ohio",5

Arches National Park,Great time to come to Arches National Park as the crowds were minimal; weather was good (65-75 F). Some hiking sites get rather busy so getting there early is always a good motto. Devil's Garden Trial is an amazing hike as was the primitive loop trail to come back to the parking lot; we definitely think that traveling this loop clockwise is the best as there are some challenging areas on the primitive loop that are easier coming down than coming up. The Delicate Arch Trail was excellent but since it is such a popular trail getting there early allows for pictures without people in the pictures too. The Windows Loop trail is a must; a lot of beautiful arches with very little effort in comparison to the other two trails mentioned.

Keep in mind that if you want to hike the Fiery Furnace without a guide, you must get a permit (issued at the visitor center) in advance. They limit the number of permits issued each day.

Surprised to see what an international location it is. We toured with Chinese, Japanese, Brits, Germans, French (and some Americans). Cool that this in our own backyard and people travel from across the globe to experience it. Spent a full week hiking trails and doing ranger tours. Best stuff was Landscape Arch, Balanced Rock, Windows area and of course, Delicate Arch. Note: In October you can't reserve Fiery Furnace Hike in advance... but when we got there there was a 1 week wait, so we were blocked out. But there were so many great hikes it was OK.

Day 1 - Delicate Arch (moderate hike, unique, very crowded especially at the arch), Double Arch and Windows and Turret Arch (easy hike, wonderful views from the primitive trail behind Windows) and Park Avenue (easy hike, felt like we were walking through a dry river bed between spectacular peaks). It was a long, but very doable day of hiking. Day 2- Devils Garden to Double O Arch (moderate hiking, but a little scary for me due to my fear of heights). I highly recommend the short side hikes to Partition and Navajo Arches. Both are exquisite and quiet. We also made the strolls to Sand Dune and Broken Arches- really easy walks- especially after descending from the Devils Garden. We thoroughly enjoyed both days of hiking and recommend all of the hikes. The rangers were very helpful and pleasant - and the Visitor Center gift store staff were awesome too.

Arches National Park,"We got to Delicate Arch early in the morning. The earlier, the better because the parking in this park is horrendous. You have to wait until someone leaves otherwise. The 3 mile hike up is a little tough for us in our late 60's, but with the cool weather it was fine. You walk up in elevation on large rock formations. the only bathroom is at the beginning. If you are afraid of heights, you might not want to do this one because the last part of the train is a path along the side of this boulder. The rock is carved to make a path where the canyon is at your side. It did not bother me, but I saw several people holding onto the side of the boulder as they climbed and came down. It looks just like the picture shown above. You can walk under it to get your picture, but you have to wait in line like everyone else for a snap shot. We had just missed some young men with their cellos that played as the sun came up. This is the one you should do first out of all of the hikes because it gets crowded. On our way back, there were hundreds of people coming up and no parking spaces. There are other arches in this area that we took advantage of once we got to the parking lot.

The visitor centre is excellent, with a shop selling affordable souvenirs. From the start of the drive round the park, we could not stop saying 'wow'! It's hard to find words to describe the wonder of this place.There are many stopovers, allow with amazing things to see. The map given at the entry points out all the stops and names of the rocks etc.There are information boards telling about the geography and history of how these amazing formation came about and it is fascinating.We took a short hike from Courthouse Towers towards Park Avenue, but turned around after about halfway, as there are many steps at the Park Avenue side. It was mind blowing to think we were walking on the same ground that dinosaurs had walked across! With the cliffs soaring up around, it is really worth the effort. We continued our drive, viewing the amazing rock formations, the Organ, the Three Gossios,, the petrified dunes, far reaching views over Moab, I could go on and on.Towards the late afternoon, we were driving the latter part of the drive, where most of the Arches are. We took a hike through the canyon to the Sandstone arch and it was the most magical experience. The colours in there, the atmosphere, the formations of the Red Rocks, wow!As the sun was setting, the colours became even more amazing. We walked up to the Turret arch and the north and south windows. What an experience! The sun was lighting everything up and made for amazing photos.Worth every penny of the $25 dollar entrance fee!

Because of mobility issues with one of us we did not fully partake of the many trails which could be explored. Certainly the weather was perfect the day we went, when hiking would hvae been fantastic. On one of our last stops we met a caretaker for one of the camps who wanted a ride back to her campsite.

It was 108 degrees that day and the climb to the arch was steep and rigorous. My daughter and her friend hike all the time and they couldn't believe how hard it was to get all the way to the arch. I however only made it halfway before I felt like I was on the verge of heat exhaustion. I sat down under a tiny scrub tree with about 15 other people who decided to wait it out and let there more fit younger or determined family members and friends make it to the top. We could have taken the driving tour which we ended up doing after the girls came back from the arch . you can see every attraction then you can get out and walk to most of them you can also take animals on the driving tour.

This time the weather was perfect and we arrived early enough to do several, starting with Delicate Arch at sunrise. All the hikes are fantastic, most are suitable for kids (drop by the visitor's center for advice), and there is a nice geology handout to take along so that you understand how this was formed.

Sunrise and sunset are best - obviously for the light, but also for the crowds. The line up for vehicles accessing the park can be back to the highway (around 30 - 45 minute wait.) as it is one road in and one road out.

Arches National Park,"To avoid lineups at the entrance, it's best to arrive before 9:30AM. Then you have to decide what you going to and in what order. Since parking is problematic and Delicate Arch is most popular, we started at the Delicate Arch, then to the Devils Garden and ended-up with the Windows section. To reach the Delicate Arch you need to hike 2.5km up the mountain and 2.5km back. We saw many people of different ages hiking. The view is amazing and, specially, when you reach the arch. Plenty of picks to take on the way. Totally worth the effort.Next we drove to the Devils Garden, waited for a parking spot and did a short hike, that starts right at the parking. New place, new arches.And for last, we went to the Windows section and saw the North and South Window arches and Turret arch. Of course, there are plenty spots on the way to stop and take pictures.Be patient in the parking lots and a spot becomes available. All in all it's a unique experience.","October 23, 2016",Come early and profit from amazing scenery,112,"Montreal, Canada",5
Arches National Park,"I recently returned from a Utah NP trip and visited Arches while I was there. It was absolutely gorgeous and stunning and there were some amazing hikes. BUT - this was my least favorite park, in terms of crowds and cleanliness. Pretty much every point I visited, I needed to circle multiple times to find parking and there is no shuttle at this park, so you really don't have a choice in this. The crowds were kind of understandable though, it's great to see so many people enjoying nature. What I had a real problem with was the filth and disrespect shown by so many of those people. The bathrooms reeked and there were blatant displays of people disregarding the requests to stay on the trails. There were a lot of really loud, obnoxious people as well, which detracted from my overall enjoyment of the park. This is definitely a park that would be most enjoyed in the off season or plan it so you're visiting the ""hot spots"" (Devil's Garden, Delicate, and Fiery Furnace in particular) EARLY so you don't waste a ton of time looking for parking. Zion and Bryce were crowded too, but I felt like the management of the crowds at those parks was excellent and the people were much more respectful. Arches felt like Zion's little frat brother. ;)","October 23, 2016","So so gorgeous, but also so so crowded!",15,"Orlando, Florida",3

There was lots of other amazing scenery to see on the way and we got some great photos without leaving the car!We walked to the lower viewing point for the arch we were going to see and it was some way off but was still impressive. It was a very hot day though and we were short of time so unfortunately couldn't spend ages walking around to see the more impressive stuff.I'm sure we barely scratched the surface and you need a whole day and lots of water to do it all properly but we still enjoyed what we saw.,"October 23, 2016",Spectacular scenery,211,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",5

Arches National Park,"Devil's Garden had several arches to offer if you could make the full hike. The hike is strenuous and is best in hiking boots with trek poles due to the sand, rock and incline climbing, cactus needles, and occasional rattle snake you will encounter. Delicate arch is fantastic, nothing like rounding the last bend and there it stands. The hike is strenuous with incline climbing, however, with frequent rest on the way it is very doable. The arch itself is incredible, well worth the sweat to get there.","October 22, 2016",Devil's Garden and Delicate Arch,11,,5
Arches National Park,"Arches NP was amazing! We got into the park early to watch a sunrise. We drove to the windows section, when it was still dark. Once the sun came up, it was amazing to see all the scenery! Please please please, if you go there to see a sunrise, please be respectful of the people who got there before you to scope out the perfect spot. The point of going to see a sunrise in arches, is to see the sun shine THROUGH the arches. So don't climb into the arch, as the signs say not to, and block everyone else's view. That's just disrespectful. The National Parks are for EVERYONE!! If you want to see Delicate Arch, plan to hike the trail to the arch. It's not an easy hike, but that's really the only way to truly experience it. The view points of the arch are very disappointing. There are still very far away from the actual arch. Landscape Arch is worth the hike. The Windows Section has a nice primitive hiking trail that lets you see the front of the two arches. Double Arch is also cool. Balancing rock, is not that great.

You'll see various shapes in these formations, and as you continue on, you can have fun identifying what other things you 'see' in the park.

If you can manage it go early, before the crowds and head to the far parking lot and hike the Devils Garden hike. You will knock off 11 awesome arches. It's a 11.6 KM round trip hike and worth every step (bring lunch and water). Go back into the park for a second day and knock off the other areas- park avenue- walk in 1/2 a mile to get a good feel for the enormity of the area, delicate arch- go to the arch not just the look out spots and The windows section-If you are tight on time, bypass the hike around the back of the windows. If you are in a 4X4 Willow springs road is a gas... but it is truly made for high clearance vehicle. Be on the look out for dinosaur tracks near Klonzo biking area near the end of the cray road- super cool.

Arches National Park,"Regardless of the constant tiring and boring explanations that they try to make you swallow about the nature of these rock formations, this place will make you question if we are living in a world that can be measured, observed and tested, and therefore, validated, or if, perhaps, there is something else out there, a bit less tangible, a bit more out of our comprehension, a bit more spiritual.Despite of the crowds, this is a place to find peace, to find the answer to the big questions in life, or if you are like most people, to take a shot and move on, but given the espectacular show of living rocks in Arches, I would use each minute in this park to connect with Nature, this is the perfect place for that.The parking lots get full easily, it is better to try to arrive as early as possible, visitors tend to be noisy, for some reason, and the less of them around, the better.The hike to Delicate Arch is extremely hard and difficult, specially if it is hot, unless you are quite fit, reconsider taking one of the many other hikes offered, if you do choose to take it, the Arch is seen at the distance once you arrive, and depending on whether there are serious photographers around, you will not be able to come close to the Arch itself, as they will yell at you.Always carry lots of water, it is very hot and dry over there. Many of the rock formations can be seen from the road, with no need to do serious hikes, but the most picturesque and beautiful Arches require moderate hikes.Unless you arrive before dawn, you will constantly be surrounded by crowds, still, peace is present everywhere here if you train your mind to discard noise pollution from the crowds.An experience like no other.","October 21, 2016",Out of this world,80,Cadiz,5

Left the park for Canyonlands late morning. If we had more time I would have stayed in the park the rest of the day as there were other hikes we skipped on this trip. My only concern is how bad those little outhouses smell. With the huge crowds there more maintenance of these sites to control the odor would be appreciated. In addition there were lines to use the only 4 toilets at Devils Garden trailhead. There is only one place with flush toilets and that's at the Visitor Center.

Arches National Park,"The geology here is amazing. We went for the hiking but we were disappointed. There are only a few longer, more strenuous hikes.

We went early October and it was still very busy. ","October 18, 2016",Amazing geology; lots of tourists,17,Shropshire,4

Arches National Park,"We have visited Arches National Park 4 times now (driving down from Seattle!) and would visit it again in a heartbeat. There are so many varied, wonderful trails to take. If you go to Devil's Garden, get there early if you want a parking spot. The hiking possibilities from there are superb with many various arches and side trails to be taken. My favorite hike is to Double ""O"" Arch. You have the option of taking the so-called ""primitive trail"" which ends up being a loop trail or going straight out and straight back. I would consider this trail to be on the more challenging side if you are not fit. Double ""O"" is beautiful as is the hike out there. We've done it in the morning and also in the late afternoon and evening. The lighting is definitely better for photographs in the late afternoon. The ""primitive trail"" option is a bit more challenging that the out and back route. Check with a ranger before taking the former route to see if there are any big potholes full of water to navigate. It's an adventure!Another arch not to be missed is Delicate Arch. The lighting is fantastic in the evening. The only problem with this arch is it's popularity. It is THE iconic arch in Arches National Park and the there are literally hoards of people from every nation there. Everyone seems to want to go stand in the middle of the arch and jump around and have their picture taken. People line up to do this. So, if you want to take a ""pure"" photograph of Delicate Arch it's difficult to get one without people in and around it. One time we were there, all the photographers lined up got so frustrated they finally started yelling in unison, ""Get out of the arch please for 5 minutes so that we can take some pictures!!!"" The people actually complied. If you can photoshop people out of the photo, good for you. In spite of these minor annoyances, it's truly a spectacular, gorgeous arch.One could easily spend 3 to 4 days exploring Arches National Park.","October 17, 2016",One of the best parks in Southern Utah,13,"Seattle, Washington",5

You need to make reservations at least 9 months in advance as its always booked. From the campground you can spend days and days hikiing, exploring the famous arches and rock formations and looking at dark sky with stars popping out everywhere. A favorite for both US and international travelers from all over the world.

Arches National Park,"All national parks are the best, but Arches--holy cow yes. Just yes. You think you've seen it all when you're driving around Moab. There's red cliffs and sand all over the place, but all it takes is one drive two miles out of town and up one tiny hill to be transported into this HUGE other world. If you're in a hurry you can do some quick driving, if you have time, stop and do every little hike. You'll fall in love, you'll find your spirit animal, heck you might even step on your spirit animal if it's a lizard or a snake. Pack water, pack a whole lunch cooler full of ice and shade umbrellas and get in there for the whole day. If you're luck you get to camp, but for those who don't have tons of time, you will feel changed from seeing this awesome national park. ","October 17, 2016",Of course.

While we found it impossible to say which of the three parks was the ""best"" or our favorite it is hard not to sing the praises of Arches. We worried about the parking at the trailheads given large numbers of visitors and no shuttle like Zion and Bryce but we had no trouble finding a spot at each of our selected trails. Be patient. Worth it. Go to Arches to see the mind blowing arches. But the fins and towers and pinnacles all amaze. The park is relatively small so with careful planning you can accomplish a lot in one full day. Shoot for a sunrise arrival. The park has a traffic webcam to check on conditions so as to maximize your time in this majestic spot. ","October 17, 2016",Majestic,9,"San Rafael, California",5

Driving into the park in the morning is clearly a bummer.We hiked the whole park, including the ""Primitive"" section of Devil's Garden.

If you decide to hike on the primitive trails (designated as very difficult) especially at the Devils Garden area, make sure you are not afraid of heights. Some of the cairns lead up and down steep rock faces that require rock climbing skills or rope. Butt sliding was required in a few places. There were two small rain bursts while we were hiking and sand from the trails were tracked on to the rocks making them slippery. We did this hike on September 30, 2016 and it was great; just the right temperature. I can't imagine doing this hike in the peak hot summer months. Bring lots of water for the long trail hikes.The viewpoint for the Delicate Arch was anticlimactic.

There are some decent hikes, but no matter how far out you hike, do not expect to get lost in solitude.Beware that the Dark Angel trail proceeds over a 50 yard, narrow camelback with a 40' drop on one side and larger drop on the other (I'd guess 100' plus).

They are created when salt is forced to dome upward and water dissolves the salt to create a series of parallel rock fins in sandstone. The fins are then sculpted by erosion into arches, spires, and balanced rocks. We hiked to see Tunnel Arch, Pine Tree Arch, Landscape Arch, Sand Dune Arch, North Window Arch, South Window Arch, Turret Arch, and Double Arch.

It is really important to get there early and when the temperature isn't so scorching hot. We bypassed the visitors center and drove right to the Delicate Arch, hiked to it and got some pictures. Did the same to several other arches. By 11 we were worn out and hungry. Ate in our car with the air on since all the picnic tables we could find in the shade were already full. After lunch we went to the long loop hike. We only went to the pine tree arch, not the really long loop hike. By the time we got back to the windows arches we were exhausted. The heat just really drains a person! We could keep going, but if you are in need of a bench to sit and catch your breath, good luck!

We hiked in almost all of the park's trail areas during our week here. I really enjoyed the Devil's Garden area. It is at the far end of the entrance and holds a campground (full, reservations required) and picnic area. We went back into the park at night when it was clear. The view of stars and the Milky Way were incredible. Windows is a popular and fun hiking area and a place where many park at night. You can see lots of arches here. Hiking shoes, walking sticks and extra clothing can come in handy here. We did get caught in one gully washer. Also pack in your water and food and plan ahead for bathroom usage. There are very limited facilities in the park.Hours posted are not necessarily the hours staff is available. We had an annual National Park pass and had heard that there was a line to let in pass holders when the park is busy. Our experience is that the shortcut was rarely available.

That way you don't have to go out of your way or make your plans according to when you need to refill drinking containers. And you will need the water. With temps in the upper 80's combined with the altitude and dryness, we constantly drank water and still felt dryed out. This was an incredible experience.

I think it's better doing it from the delicate arch rather than starting at the other end (primitive trail). You'll need to climb, jump, hold on to the slick rock at some points.

The trails are cool enough to keep a child's interest (without causing parental heart-failure). Crowds during September high-season were manageable, and everyone is in a good mood. We spent a day and a half and took in all the major features. Delicate Arch and Devil's Garden took a few hours each because we took our time to ""smell the sagebrush"".

Arches National Park,"My husband and I enjoyed the Arches. We went the second week of October and the weather was perfect! We both climbed up into the window of the double arch to see the view on the other side. We are both 60 and pretty active so the climb is fairly easy, but I have a slight fear of heights these days so it was not my favorite activity. The slick rock was a little slick and didn't boost my confidence in my climbing abilities. Without a harness, I will never be a rock climber. We also hiked to Delicate Arch which is beautiful. The hike was a little strenuous and I was amazed at the amount of people who were bringing their small children with them. There are some narrow ledges on this hike that would have worried me with small children. The view was exceptional and watching tourists climb around the arch was both entertaining and horrifying. There are long places to tumble from here. Luckily, everyone was sure footed while we watched. I noticed there were large numbers of foreign tourists at nearly every park we visited. It is great to see the diversity! The majority were Asian, but the Germans, French, and British were well represented too.

Driving around the park is extremely easy and there are many spectacular views even from the viewpoints very close to the road.

Almost as crowded, 1/4 mile lines to even get to the entrance booth to pay the entrance fee.Arches may get as many as 1.4 million visitors in 2017.

Arches National Park,"I don't need to tell anyone how beautiful and amazing Arches NP is... but what gets a lot of folks is that the campgrounds there are booked for months ahead of time. What many folks don't know is that there are several campgrounds nearby on Mount LaSal and the surrounding area. They are mostly on a first come basis, but when I was there in Sept 2016, Arches was sold out and the Mountain campgrounds were virtually empty. An added bonus is that you can find many lakeside or streamside sites and the drive down to Arches in the morning is GORGEOUS from the mountain going down. Another added bonus is that while there was a burn ban in Arches due to dry weather, the mountain environment was cool and lush with campfires permitted. Honestly, I'd chose one of the mountain sites over the crowded, worn Arches NP sites anytime. It is also MUCH cooler at night up there.","October 12, 2016",Amazing Park!

Arches National Park,"We loved visiting Arches National Park. The rock formations are spectacular, and the views of them change seemingly minute by minute as the sun changes position. Much of the park is inaccessible without a 4 wheel drive vehicle or without doing some hiking, but the hikes are well worth the effort. Going through the park early in the day, then returning in the evening provides beautiful vistas that change with the light. It was warm at the end of September so I would guess that summer is quite hot for hiking. As all of the signs encourage visitors, be sure to take lots of water on any hike, or even drive through the park. There is no water available once inside the park. There is a beautiful picnic area near Devil's Garden--the only picnic area in the park. If you visit, return at a couple of different times of day and appreciate the changes in the landscape.

I was able to do the walk to Double arch pretty easily-its only 1 mile rt. It was spectacular! I also managed to walk to Landscape Arch-that was much more of a challenge given the elevation and up hill trail. Even younger people fall on the rocks-right before us. You can't have peace and quiet at any of the prominent features in the Park because of the high volume of tourists (including us) even in late September. The tour buses constantly disgorge picture snapping and tripod-setting-up tourists. Their loud and shrill voices bounce off the rocks and arch walls, and you have to go around them as they are taking group photos on the paths. The paths to the Windows arch section are busy even into evening. Even so, the Park is an amazing place. It is quite hot in summer, and even late September. My husband enjoyed the Park Avenue walk.

In addition to stopping at all the places along the main road we also took a 4x4 adventure into the back country of the park to see arches that are inaccessible from the main road.

Arches National Park,"We visited Arches in September as part of a swing through all five of the Utah National Parks. Arches could well be the most crowded, mainly because there are so many spectacular photo opportunities right on or very close to the main rod. The line for cars to get into the park can extend for a mile or more at the worst times. If you arrive before 9:00 AM, though, you shouldn't have any trouble driving in. We were told by a ranger that they are considering changing the system next year to require advance reservations for specific dates, so it's worth checking the NPS website before going there.There are very few conveniences inside the park, so you'll need to do some planning. No food service (well, I think you can get snacks in the NPS gift shop), very few restrooms (and they're porta-potties - pungent in the mid-day heat) and only two places to refill your water bottle, so you'll want to make sure you bring more than one bottle and keep it topped off.If you can, you should definitely consider the Fiery Furnace tour. They offer it mornings and afternoons - you have to reserve the morning tour online and it's filled up months in advance. You can make afternoon reservations at the Visitor Center, but they fill up really fast, too. One tip: they do get one-person or two-person cancellations for both tours, so there's always a chance you can get lucky at the last minute. BTW - the ""fiery furnace"" refers to the color of the rock formations, not how hot it is - but you'll still want to bring lots of water.We had assumed that we'd avoid a lot of crowds by waiting until mid-September to go there. Wrong! It turns out the fall semester at European universities doesn't start in November, and there were a tremendous number of college students at the park, in addition to all the retirees who had also decided to wait. I talked with our hotel clerk, who told me that there really isn't a slow time of year - Asian tourists in the spring, Americans in the summer, and Europeans in the fall.I suppose you can do a quick drive-through and see the most familiar sites in one day, but if you can, you should really plan on a minimum of two days - if you've got the time, take more and include a trip to the Island in the Sky section on Canyonlands - it's only about 30-45 minutes further.","October 8, 2016",Arrive early - could be the most crowded national park in Utah,69,"Boise, Idaho",5

The scenery was spectacular with numerous places to pull over or into to get closer for pictures and stand in awe. Stopped at Balanced Rock but did not walk further for Windows. Walked the 1.5 miles to the see Delicate Arch. The hike is not for the faint of heart. Very tough to get to but worth the hike. Take plenty of water.

Arches National Park,"Arches is nearly indescribable for its beauty and diversity of rock formations. Everyone else must think so, too, as there are crowds, even in October. If you do not have mobility issues, take the primitive trails. They're not too difficult, but require more dexterity. The reward is the loss of crowds and enjoyment of seeing the Arches from the back side without unobstructed views of camera-toting droves. But, who can really be bothered by crowds with geology this spectacular.

Arches National Park,"In two words it is ""just great."" I did do advanced planning, prior to our visit to Moab and Arches National Park. My main mission was to hike up to ""delicate arch"" and stand beneath it. Mission was accomplished, but the 1.5 mile hike on the trail of steps, stones and slick rock had me questioning the mission. The sight was really spectacular when you turn the corner of the ledge and see the arch. Then to walk the bowl shaped slick rock to actually stand under the arch, that made it all worth the hike.There are shorter hikes to other arches and rock formations like ""double arch"" and ""balanced rock"", but for me "" delicate"" is the best.Do your planning and stop at the visitors center for info to help make your visit enjoyable.Some parking lots and viewing spots fill up faster than others so take that into account when visiting the park.

Bring plenty of water and a picnic as there are no services available in the park except at front visitors center there is a water faucet.

Based on previous posts, we knew to arrive at the park early the next morning. Sure glad we followed that advice as we were easily able to drive without delay through the park to Devil's Garden Trailhead and hike to Landscape Arch, Pine Tree Arch, and Tunnel Arch with little foot traffic. We thought we would be seeing primarily arches, but were surprised by the gorgeous rock formations of all kinds throughout the park. We joked the park reminded us of Monument Valley...but on steroids! When we returned to the trailhead parking lot around 11, the parking lot was full with cars waiting for spots. We also stopped at Fiery Furnace and Panorama Point then headed out of the park surprised by the long train of cars making their way into the park. We returned to the park around 3:30 to visit the viewpoints from Park Ave. to the Windows section. As we'd heard, the park was not crowded at all during the late afternoon. As a bonus, so many of the views were even more spectacular with the lighting of the afternoon sun. We timed our stops so we would be at the Windows for sunset. The colors of the rocks as the sun set transitioned from glorious shades of orange, to a deeper crimson, and maroon, along with the sky awash with shades of blue and pink, made for a most memorable trip.

The Balanced Rock trail is also interesting as it allows you to circle the feature giving you different perspectives from every angle.While you are able to take in some of the sights in just a few hours, to enjoy the park to the fullest you need to spend several days there.

Arches National Park,"What a great place! What I like about Arches is that it's not SO super big that you end up wasting half the day thinking about what you wanna do ;)Personally I went for the Devils Garden hike in the morning including the primitive trail. I think it took me about 3 hours and a half including photo time. Great trail and it's not as difficult as some brochures make it sound.After this trail I drove the gravel road to the Klondike Bluff area (doable in any car in good weather) and started off on the Tower Arch hike. I would recommend this one also since you can stand inside this nice arch and when I was there, this place was deserted almost, a lot more quiet than the devils garden in any case. If you are up for it I suggest to take these trails which are advertised as more difficult because all others were absolutely packed (this was mid September). Note I drank 2 liters of water on each of these walks so 4 liter in total. And I usually don't drink a lot. Not sure what it is about this place but it makes you thirsty.

When we returned four hours later the parking lot was a zoo. We left to go to Tower Arches which can be reached via a dirt road and only very few people go there. It was great there. The drive out of the park was slow.Bottomline: go early or late in the afternoon. It is way too crowded during the day. Be prepared to drive well below the speed limit due to people driving very slowly and looking (instead of pulling out and looking).","October 1, 2016","Nice park, but also very crowded",51,"Houston, Texas",4
Arches National Park,"Arches is a spectacular place. Ancient rock formations abound, from the Three Gossips to the many arches the experience is over the top.So many visitors and reviews giving great ratings and descriptions make writing a review difficult as most everything has already been said.We happened to arrive midday on Labor Day weekend so the Park was quite crowded. Nonetheless it was well worth the drive. Thankfully so many of our great treasures have been set aside. We did it in a day but I’d recommend taking more time in the area and seeing Canyonlands as well, spend the night in Moab and really take a bit of time to enjoy the area.We plan to return to do just that.","October 1, 2016",Gorgeous,315,"Cedar City, Utah",5

Arches National Park,"Up to our visit to Arches, I thought Bryce Canyon was No. 2 behind Yellowstone, but now Arches is my second favorite. The views were really something to behold and the park was well maintained. Take lots of water for the hikes on the well marked trails. Please take the trails, at least a couple of the shorter ones. I feel sorry for those not capable of walking the trails, since most are not, and cannot be made handicap accessible without destroying the whole feeling of remoteness. Do not visit on weekends if you can help it. It does get very crowded. Take lots of digital space since you will take lots of photos. ","October 1, 2016",Only Yellowstone better,17,Mt. Vernon,5

Arches National Park,"At 73,000+ acres, The Arches is relatively small but it is filled with the most diverse arches anywhere in the world. An interesting fact is that, to be designated as an arch, the opening has to be at least 3 feet and (this could be the sticky part), it has to be given a name. In spite of the rigors of becoming an official arch, the park has 2,400 such ""official"" arches.The visitor center is open from 8 am to 4:30 pm daily (except for Christmas) and the park is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The park is located 5 miles north of Moab on US 191. It has been a national park since receiving its designation in 1979.Our guide, David, planned a full 1/2 day tour designed to give us a view of, or walk to, the most famous of the landmark sites (arches as well as other formations). We made these arrangements through Moab Adventure Center.Little facts our expert guide shared was that Moab has the ideal amount of rain for arch formation: 10 inches a year. He also pointed out ares where arches were in the progress of forming; we could see the rounded sections calving away from the main rock. He also took us up to an arch (some rock climbing effort was certainly needed) for an awesome peek down at least a mile (probably more) on the other side. This park is an easy to difficult park to hike in and around but there is something for all aptitudes and it is family friendly. After getting our feet wet (so to speak), we can't wait to return and making a week series of trips to this park. Everything was so unique; we did not feel like we ere seeing the same arch over and over again (just in a different place with a different name).It was so quiet most of the time that we felt like we were the only ones out there in nature. The dramatic storm-threatening skies added another dimension to this perfect day. Our guide really came through for us!Almost all of the Arches National Park major arches, formations, and trail heads are reviewed in TA as separate"" things to do"" in ""The Arches National Park"" instead of ""things to do"" in ""Moab"". This review is more of an overview and the detailed reviews are listed separately under the Arches National Park heading.","September 30, 2016",Using a guide was the best way to see it all in a half-day,1377,Tucson,5

Arches National Park,This place is just beautiful and awe-inspiring. So easy to get to from Moab. Then many of the arches and rock formations are just off the road with a short hike. If you get an early start you can do a lot of it in a day though you could spend three or four days here too. The hike to delicate arch is a bit strenuous but most people can do it if they take their time. There are plenty of people I've seen who look way out of shape but they get up there. It's worth the exertion. Only real negative is it is very busy. Hard to get photos of some of the arches without people in them.

Arches National Park,"We were only here a day but we did quite a few hikes to see the arches. We started with Delicate Arch, which is a shorter but tiring hike. Definitely worth the view and photos when you get there. Also did landscape arch, tapestry, and few others. Delicate and landscape by far were the best. It gets pretty hot around 2-3, so i'd try to hike before or after. We tried to go to the Whale arch, but even with our jeep we had to turn around because the road was impassable. The only truck we saw that could make it was one of those Monster trucks with crazy high clearance. ","September 29, 2016",Hot but worth the hikes,25,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",4

Arches National Park,"The Arches National Park is a picturesque detour worth taking if you have a few hours to spend seeing the spectacular wonders that nature has carved from the sandstone mountains in the area. There are plenty of turn outs along the roadway to allow you to step out and take photos, and it is well worth stopping at them. We visited the park in mid September and the temperatures were tolerable. I am told we should avoid the hot summer months, especially if planning a hike or two. Still, we enjoyed the beauty of the park and are very thankful that it is a National Park protected from developers. The scenes of red rock and formations remind me of something you might expect to see on Mars! I highly recommend visiting Arches National Park. One tip: If you plan on visiting any of the 5 great national parks in Utah and perhaps the Grand Canyon in Arizona in the same year, by all means purchase the National Park Pass ANNUAL PASS. For only $80.00, it will get you into ANY National Park in the United States. It has already paid for itself after a visit to the Grand Canyon, Arches and Canyon lands National Parks.

You have to have a Hat, Water, and Hiking boots to traverse the terrain, some up to miles ( one was a 1.6 mile hike in dessert sand, no thanks ). This would be a great Park if you were under 40 and visit the Park in Spring & Fall but not in the Winter or Summer. We were looking for a better outcome.

Arches National Park,"Arches National Park is something that you need to see to appreciate. The wonders and grandeur of nature are on display here...especially when the weather and lighting are at its best. It's all here for the taking....a hike, a car ride, or a guided tour. Our visit was a combination of all the above. Drive to certain locations, then hike to see the arches or petroglyphs up close. The beauty and size of these structures is amazing. In spite of the traffic through the park, it is well kept and clean. It is my hope that people will respect and cherish these monuments to preserve them for generations to come. Our group took the 1.5 mile hike to Delicate Arch. The most trying section of the hike was the climb over the large boulder section. Be sure to wear good shoes, bring water and wear sunscreen (if you go in the mid-afternoon). Once you're completed the hike....first congratulate yourself, then enjoy the view of the magnificant arch. It really is impressive. On our last day in Moab, we took a HumVee sunset tour of the park. It takes a little over two hours to complete the tour and it gives you a chance to see the park at sunset in a relaxing and entertaining guided tour.

Arches National Park,"If you're going to Arches to hike, bravo. However, if like us you are doing the ""Gilligan's Island"" version (a 3-hour tour), keep the camera ready at all times and make a note of these spots which are as simple as a pullout, get out and shoot: Park Avenue Overview, Courthouse Towers, Petrified Dunes Viewpoint, Balanced Rock, and The Windows Road. If you have time for an easy hike, park at the end of The Windows Road and hike to The Windows, about 1/2 mile each way.If you've never been to Arches and, like everyone else, 99% of the pictures you've seen have been of Delicate Arch, you may be disappointed in what I have to say next. If you're short on time, forget Delicate Arch-- the only view you'll get with a short hike is seeing the arch from about 1/2 mile away, and even with a huge zoom lens you won't have much to show the folks back home, and yours will be one of the disappointed faces walking back to your car as the eager faces walk in. The photogenic option is to drive to the Wolfe Ranch trailhead and make the 3-hour round-trip hike to the arch itself.Go early or go late unless you enjoy miles of traffic and clogged parking lots.

Arches National Park,"Come early and stay late to see all the colors of this park from sunrise to sunset and then stay for the stars and at the end of the day as you look through the pictures taken they still will not compare to the memories stored in side your memories. Start out your day at delicate arch for a couple of reasons, parking, the 1.5 mile hike is better in the cool of the morning and the sun coming through the arch is amazing. Just be aware as the day progresses parking will become a nightmare of epic proportions, and the frustration level of all these drivers causes some of them to be more aggressive so plan accordingly. The Park rangers are very helpful and are there to make sure you stay safe by having water, hats and other clothing to make sure your stay will be memorable. As with all types of people working with the public there are those who enjoy their jobs and are very helpful and give great suggestions and others who should find a new line of employment, one that doesn't deal with the public. You can do this park in one day if you are in good shape and can walk miles with out getting worn out, but even then you will not see all the arches, 2 to 3 days is very doable for all the major arches and the out of the way but just as majestic arches off the beaten path.The Good: Wonderful water worn sandstone sculptures that defy gravity and give the viewer awe at natures architecture. The Bad: a lot of people that should take care that this is a desert and act accordinglyThe ugly: The parking is limited and needs to have someone analyze flow patterns and use creativity to make more spaces.On the scuba bubble scale of 1 to 10 I give this national park 9 bubbles for what nature created and -3 bubbles for the parking.","September 26, 2016","Arches, canyons, monoliths, balancing rocks what more could you ask for!",173,"Kalispell, Montana",4

Arches National Park,"Unbelievable! Better than the Grand Canyon, because you are right in the middle of the skyward-pointing arches that zoom upward at every turn. It’s so popular we had a 20-minute line to get to entrance. We had our senior lifetime Parks pass so didn't have to pay the $25 entry. Limited facilities for potty breaks, though visitors center just inside park does have great toilets. Clue: Go before you go! There are literally too many photo opportunities. The more you drive into the park, the more impressed you will be. Give it a few hours and take your time. We were a bit rushed because of commitments up the road. Two hours was not enough time. Our most impressive sight was Balanced Rock. See it to believe it. Or look at my photos. It is still unbelievable.","September 26, 2016",Better than the Grand Canyon,237,"Roseville, California",5

Arches National Park,"Great hiking for a variety of skill levels available.We enjoyed the ranger-led hike at Windows. We also appreciated the suggestions given at the Visitor Center regarding suggested hikes for our three days in the area. We also visited Canyonlands, Island in the Sky and Needles, and looked for several hieroglyphs in the area. There is a lot of sand in the hiking areas so wear appropriate socks and footwear. Also it was very windy the day we hiked Arches and we could have used kerchief for our face. It was hot so I had on shorts and my legs were pelleted with sand causing an extensive rash. Longer pants or socks would have been better.","September 26, 2016",Beautiful NP,3,"Joplin, Missouri",5

Arches National Park,"This is one of those places filled with energy. It offers the opportunity to walk/hike at your leisure, the visitors can go as far as they want, if wanting to get away form crowds. The area is surprisingly windy, you will definitely want to protect your eyes from dust/desert-like sand. Paths are well signed and even the 'this is not a path' warnings, will prevent you from going stupid. You must wear and carry sunscreen, water and energy bars for snacks. The area is vast enough to divide your exploring in two days, or you may spend an entire day as well, if you have the endurance for it. The visitor center is by the entrance, and the store is a must. They carry really cool, unique and well made souvenirs. I suggest you stop by there before heading up to the rock formations. You can even fill up your potable water containers at the visitor center. Some asian visitors I ran into were appalled by the entrance booth ranger giving them a pamphlet on how to use a toilet. I have to agree, that is definitely an ignorant move. How do park staff determine that foreigners are to blame for an out-of-target human necessity? It's just wrong, and here is the truth, US National Park outhouses (yes, that all they have), are disgusting, if you ever need to use one, hold your breath and of course, your gut feeling will prompt you not to touch anything, do your business, and run for dear life as fast as you can. BTW, here is a life saving tip. Stop by the visitor center after you pay your entrance fee, and use those restrooms if you want to feel like you are still in the first world. Avoiding outhouses inside the park will always be the healthiest decision.","September 26, 2016",Breathtaking Place,27,Costa Rica,5

Talk about fantastic!We then went on the Balanced Rock and to the various arches in the park. You can do Arches NP in a day. We did some easy hikes and really enjoyed it.

Arches National Park,"What happened to our beloved Arches National Park? I last visited 15 years ago and was able to easily park at any turn-out to view features or do a hike. This year in September it was a zoo, badly over-crowded and congested to the point I could not park at many points of interest because of extremely high visitor volume. I did find a parking spot at Balanced Rock but the huge crowds, including a large bus tour group, made walking on the trail feel more like a cattle drive rather than a nature walk. Sad to say, I believe the park experience here is vastly diminished due to visitor volume. Maybe February or March would be a better timeframe for a visit but I won't be coming back in the autumn again.","September 24, 2016",Crowded and sadly over-run,278,"Stillwater, Minnesota",2

Parking lots overflowing, long lines to enter, etc. Second, the drive through the park is easy. The stopping points do not get you near the advertised attraction. You must plan to hike to get close to any attractions. Great if you are into hiking or in great shape. Disappointing if you are retired a few tears. However, we did see many arches up close that are outside the park and in the general area. If you visit here, plan on taking 1-2 days minimum and walking a lot.

Arches National Park,"What a gem of a National Park is Arches! The scale of the park allows for reasonably detailed exploration in a single day, or several days of getting to know the remote arches and hiking trails. We visited on one day, driving along the different viewpoints and hiking up to Delicate Arch and Landscape Arch. The former was more strenuous than the latter, but totally worth it. Water can be refilled at the Devils Garden parking lot. There is no food on purchase in the park, so bring your own picnic so you can stay longer. There are many stopping points on the route to admire different formations. Once you have an access ticket, you can go into the park multiple times, and we took advantage of this by skipping into the park again towards Sunset, in time to admire the views at Balanced Rock.

For those with a fear of hikes, lots of the hikes are out but some aren't and those are worth the effort. Be sure to bring lots of water. The Park Place hike is pretty easy and no problem for those with a fear of heights. Devil's Garden has an initial section that is great in both those accounts too. The Delicate Arch hike is beautiful but the last little bit is definitely no good for those who have a fear of heights. The ledge is about 4' wide with a deep drop off on one side. My husband hiked the whole thing but didn't get to see the Arch because he couldn't make the last stretch. He enjoyed it regardless, though, because it is so pretty.

The park sits in the middle of the desert, there is no shade and it gets very hot. Landscape Arch is amazing and the hike there is not very difficult. Close to Landscape arch sits Pine tree Arch, that is worth the visit. Other sites we visited and loved were Double Arch, with easy access, and The North and South Windows, kind of twin Arches that are very close to Double Arch.

When I was returning from the hike at around 11am, tons of people started coming in, so it's always worth it to wake up early! Hiked the other short hikes nearby. After dinner returned to hike the windows section, which is best in the evening since the sun hits the windows creating a wonderful glow. It was full moon, and was amazing to see the moon come up from behind. The next evening we went to Park Avenue (great in the evening), the hiked to Delicate Arch (please don't hike there with sandals on...saw too many people almost get hurt! This hike has steep dropoffs)...saw the sunset (if you stay at delicate arch for sunset and leave right after the sun goes down you will have just about enough time to return to parking lot without needing a flashlight, though it's always good to have one, esp if you need to use the toilet afterward!). Saw the stars and full moon at Lasal Mnts overlook - beautiful!!! Next morning double arch. The hikes range from short to long, easy to strenuous.

It is probably best to drive by everything else to park there first and then work your way south. The delicate arch isn't the same from the overlook. It is best to hike there. There's an uphill climb over rock so make sure you are prepared for it.","September 20, 2016",Spectacular ,21,"Plymouth, Massachusetts",5

There are many trails ranging from easy such as the .3 mile hike at balanced rock to moderate such as Par Avenue which is 2 miles one way, but you need to do the return 2 miles unless you have someone to take you back at the other end to strenuous 7.2 mile Devil's Garden Loop.

Arches National Park,We used our Parks pass to enter. Whilst there was a queue to enter and the park looked busy. When we did our hike it was ok. Watched the film about how the arches formed in the visitor centre which is interesting. Picked up a map of the walks from the centre. Topped up with water for a hike. Visited the rest rooms. We stopped off at various view points in the Park. Amazing! We completed the Delicate Arch hike. There is a historic farmhouse near the beginning of the trail and Petroglyphs. You are advised to take two litres of water. On a hot day that is essential. It was cloudy when we walked so didn't need it all. You could feel the heat coming off the rocks. It is a strenuous walk but we took it slowly and it was well worth while. We took 2 hours. ,"September 20, 2016",Amazing rock formations!,502,"North Wales, United Kingdom",5

Had we been up to the walking, there were plenty of great places to hike, short and long trails. There is indeed something for everyone on this venture.

Arches National Park,"I really do not like to give bad reviews of great places, but this SPECIFIC trail is a ... dud. I have hiked up to Delicate Arch, and it is an amazing sight to see, so I wanted to see what the view was like from the Lower Viewpoint Trail. Not worth the effort. If I did not know what I was looking for, I could have missed the arch. If you do not have time to hike up to the arch, then there are other trails that are easily accessible with much better views of other arches.

Arches National Park,"Awesome...amazing...breathtaking. Words can't describe the beauty of this National Park. Once you enter by the visitor entrance the ride up to Delicate arch..which is the arch that is most famous...is about 20 minutes into the park. You can't really see it from the look out area. The only way to really view it is to do the climb up a vigorous trail. The first oart of the trail looks like it could be difficult...it's climbing up a slip rock strait up for about 1/4 mile. It's a flat surface but the incline is somewhat intense. Once you get up the slip rock the trail continues for about 1/3 mile along a narrow ridge where it tends to be windy. The views are magnificent but if you are afraid of heights you should reconsider. There are no guard rails...it's all natural. It's well worth the climb even if you are huffing and wondering when you will finally view the arch. It's like nothing I've ever seen before. A natural wonder! Once you get close to the arch you can see the vastness of it. There is a ledge where you can sit overlooking the arch...but again..if you are afraid of heights this can be scary since it's a considerable ""fall"""" below. For me this was the highlight of the park but the entire park is filled with trails for every level or ability. The beauty of the red rocks and other arches were magnificent. You should give yourself the entire day to visit the park if you plan on doing Delicate Arche. If you plan to just ride through without doing any trails I'd give myself 3-4 hours so you can take I. The beauty and get some awesome photos! It was hot when we were there (September) but a different kind of hot then the east coast hot. It's bearable to do the climb. Make sure you bring plenty of water. You will need it. Be sure to use the restroom facilities at the visitors center before traveling up. There aren't many others in the park.","September 19, 2016",Mesmerizing! ,88,"Clinton, New Jersey",5

Arches National Park,"The Arches National Park is located on the plateau above Moab and is entered by one of the more spectacular roads in US National parks. The road climbs from the canyon floor up the side of 500-600 foot vertical wall of blood red stone in switch backs. Once up, the Moab fault is visible across the canyon floor and the actual arches park begins. The rock towers and mesas in incredible shades of red and yellow stretch for miles with towering columns of rock on both sides of the road. The balancing rock seems almost fake, with a large rock resting on top of a slim pillar of rock, and the rock columns make fantastic shapes. Further on, the road rises slowly through the contorted rock formations with natural bridges visible. The devil's garden is a wilderness of stone shapes with easy walking trails through the area. Camping in the park is allowed in designated areas.For hikers, there are lots of hikes to various landmarks such a the delicate arch, but for less athletic travellers or those under time constraints, most of the highlights can be observed from the road pullouts.","September 17, 2016",breathtaking entryway.

The heat is very strong, DO take plenty of water and wear a hat if you go in any of the trails. Double Arch was spectacular and a fairly easy walk to it.

Relied rock stacks and hiker tracks. The problem is - many wrong paths are well marked by many wrong hikers - via thier fresh footprints.

Arches National Park,"Being native Wisconsinites, seeing Arches National Park was a surreal experience for us. We felt we were on a different planet as we have never seen landscape like this before. We only spent one day there (I would have loved to have stayed a week), but we still were able to hike a lot of trails: Park Avenue, Balanced Rock, Double Arch, Windows, and Delicate Arch. All the trails with the exception of Delicate Arch, were very easy to hike. I liked that they had trails for all fitness levels. My favorite trail was Park Avenue...It was amazing to be down in a valley and being surrounded by the natural skyscrapers. We made the mistake of taking the Delicate Arch trail in the heat of the day instead of in the morning or evening as recommended. It is quite a hike up, but the view is so worth it. The Windows, Double Arch trails are super easy and so fun because you can get right up to the arches and take some awesome pictures. Theres also great scenic views from those trails. Balanced Rock trail is a great trail for people with physical limitations, but you can also enjoy this park from your car if hiking isn't your thing or your unable to hike. Almost all of the major attractions can be seen from the car. It's a beautiful scenic drive too.

Arches National Park,"So, be sure to stay on the trail out to Arches. If you're not an avid hiker - look for the little stone markers or follow someone. It's not for the faint of heart doing this hike. It's potential hypothermia in the morning and heat stroke in the afternoon if the hike itself and its 'moderate' incline doesn't kill you. Ok. I'm exaggerating. But not by much. Bring lots of water. No joke. I suffered a lot on the way up, but let me tell you, the view is spectacular. So Worth it.

Arches National Park,"Great scenary but very popular, very crowded. The fees are more than other Nat'l Parks because of high demand. The entry line can get up to 70 cars during the summer months. You start up a winding road carved into the redrock cliff and the rest is driving from arch to arch, each having its own name and character. Each arch requires parking and then hiking in 0.3 mile to 1.3 miles to reach the arch. It's very dry and physically demanding so make sure to have plenty of water and snacks. Make sure to put yourself in the photos with the arches. For a less crowded less expensive similiar experience, go to Natural Bridges Nat'l Monument, 90 miles south of Arches.

Arches National Park,"We spent an entire day at Arches and were so glad that we planned carefully; even in mid September, the number of cars seemed to overwhelm the available parking. Our first adventure in the park began at the Delicate Arch trailhead at 5:30am, by 6:15am we had hiked the 1.5 miles and 500 feet of elevation gain and were the first to arrive at the arch. Their was ample starlight and pre-dawn light for us to see well enough to follow the trail. The solitude and beauty at the arch were stunning. By the 7am sunrise we found ourselves with about a dozen or two others. And, when we hiked down at 9am we must have passed 50-100 arch-bound hikers. From there we drove to the road end, parked in one of the few remaining spaces at Devils Garden, and hiked out and back to the Double O Arch. That trail was accurately described in the trail flyer as difficult (sections required rock scrambling with drop-offs). We found that arch to be underwhelming, preferring the Landscape Arch and the Pine Tree Arch along that same route. Later we hiked the short trails in the Windows Section to see Turret Arch, North Window, South Window, and Double Arch. All-in-all we felt pleased that our plans allowed us to see all that we wanted, even in spite of the crowds and parking.","September 12, 2016",Definitely Worth a Planned Visit,391,"Roanoke, Virginia",5

Tucked away on the eastern side of Utah, Arches is my favorite National Park. Bring lots of water, (although water is available at the visitor's center, it's warm and kind of flat) and spend the day exploring what indigenous people believed was sacred ground. $25 park entrance fee, wear comfortable shoes (hiking boots or tennis shoes, no sandals! You'll be walking through very soft sand!) And bring a hiking stick to assist you over some of the obstacles.

The drive in, switchbacking up through the red sandstone is worth the usual price of admission (and free for those with Geezer Cards or those who arrive before or after the ranger hours). Expect hot to very hot days in summer and early fall. Beautiful hikes available for any ability level, but choose wisely and heed the water advice. Official hike descriptions often sound more dangerous (in terms of exposure) than they really are, but the water needs and sun intensity are accurate. Reservations usually required well in advance for the single campground. Plan ahead or stay outside the park.

It worked.We did not experience excessive traffic, waits, or parking issues. The ticket booth was NOT open so we entered for free. I don't know what the deal was with that but it was OK with me.

We really wanted to do it and the ranger advised us to do this hike early due to the heat. This hike is difficult but I saw many different people successfully doing it. There were many elderly, overweight people, and little kids who completed this hike. I would advise wearing a hat and sunblock and bringing at least 2 liter of water per person. Also take breaks when you need them. We took a few breaks and also hung out for awhile at the delicate arch and still completed the hike in about 2 hours.This park is amazingly beautiful.","September 6, 2016",Hike to delicate arch,102,"Homer Glen, Illinois",5

We did more hiking in this park than in the others in Utah. The signs at each stop are clearly marked with the trail distance, which is really helps you decide which hikes you want to do and which look too long. The views are wonderful (but not as good a Bryce). The terrain is mostly rocky, with only one trail being very sandy. Our group was all in running shoes or cross-trainers and we were fine.

Arches National Park,"This park was more incredible than we bargained for! Besides the unclear comments about the entrance having a steep grade, which almost stopped us being in a 40' motorhome( its not a big deal, and its a slow grade, no problem) the enormity of these rock formations were not raved about enough.There is motorhome parking at the stops we went to. When you enter there is a shop, info center, restrooms.... And then you drive by huge rocks that are named, they all look like something ( get the map from info center) . Its about 9 miles to first stop, the windows area. We walked/hiked about 3 miles there, phenomenal formations and views. Bring water! The second stop was another 5-7 mile drive in.. More hiking and nice arch and view but the windows section was the better stop. We spent several hours there. Crazy views. The formations were a easy climb, and picture worthy. Lots of people but didnt feel as crowded as zion. People from all over the world were there, we only ran into a few english speaking folks.

Arches National Park,"A fantastically beautiful place to visit, sometimes marred by too many tourists and despite the plea to stay off the arches, far too many people climb up. This spoils the natural beauty of this gorgeous place, but I guess if there was no-one there, they may not stay protected. America certainly does a lot to protect it's National and State Parks, which is why they are so well maintained, and the areas looked after. Toilets were pretty much as you'd expect in a place with no running water, so they were composting toilets, but I never once felt ""lacking"" in needing toilet paper. Some were smelly, others were fine.We wanted to do so much more walking whilst there, but our boys weren't so keen, so we mainly saw the Arches that were within a mile or two of the main roads, but each and every one was spectacular in its own right. Delicate, Windows, Fiery Furnace Hike - all beautiful and enjoyable for different reasons.To do this park properly you probably need a week - to enjoy sunrise/sunset/walks/peace/tranquility - each requires a different time of day, and we didn't have long enough to see it all.","September 4, 2016",Natural Beauty,27,"Singapore, Singapore",5

Within a relatively compact area, we can see over 2000 arches, hundreds of high rise pinnacles, giant rock formations and sweeping sandstone gardens with numerous trails to soak in the beauty and snap stunning pictures.If you only have 1 day to cover both Arches and Canyonlands, one option is to get to Arches as early as possible (open 24 hours) when it's least crowded and best for photos. Then drive out to Canyonlands, have lunch and come back to Arches in late afternoon when lots of tourists had left and perfect for dawn/sunset photos. That's what we did (Oct. 2 years back) but we plan to come back and spend more time in Arches to be able to cover the many places we missed and take the trails.

Arches National Park,"Arches NP encompasses a magnificent spectrum of geologic and topographic features. The well-paved road traversing the Park takes you through an expansive ""monument valley"" showcasing the myriad of mesas and buttes. Further up the road brings you into the ""arch"" area. Here you can take the many hiking trails to a seemingly endless number of arches: be sure to see Delicate Arch, Landscape Arch, Double Arch, Turret Arch, The Windows, Skyline Arch...and if you have set aside the time for your visit, then continue further along the trails to see the more remote arches. Early spring is one of the best times to visit, I went in mid-May...the crowds aren't yet overwhelming as they will later be from mid-June to late-August. Plus, the temperatures are quite mild in mid-May...not the oven-like temperatures that descend during summer. And early-fall would be another excellent time to visit...make sure it is after the Labor Day weekend when the crowds will diminish significantly. I have been to Arches several times, so this most recent visit I stayed about 5 hours. However, there is certainly enough to see that you could spend an entire day. Arches is truly a marvelous National Park !!!","August 30, 2016",Arches National Park - a Must See !!!,186,,5

Arches National Park,"Moab is a unique oasis offering access to some of the countries most spectacular natural wonders. Arches tops the list in this area. Although it takes deliberate planning and effort to get here I highly recommend it. You will feel like you have stepped outside of the US into another world in this sea of red rocks. Give yourself time to explore the entire area around Moab because there is a lot to experience and it is not a convenient trip to get here. My advice is to give yourself a lot of time to explore all that is here because you may not be back.You should book your hotel or camping arrangements in advance and not hope to get a spot upon arrival. This area is wild and Moab has a lot of offerings for sleep and food but it is limited and there is not a hotel at the next stop just down the road. It is an isolated area and although I got lucky my first trip and found a spot I realized that you need to plan where you will stay and book it before you go.Arches is HOT, so bring water and electrolytes and a hat and food and your camera. You can spend the entire day here if you get out of your car and walk to some of the arches or take some of the hikes offered, which I highly recommend with one exception. Devils Garden hike is not for the everyday hiker. It is very challenging and dangerous with nobody there to help you should you fall between the rocks. It can get very windy out towards the end of that hike so I advise real caution to those interested in doing this hike at the end of the park. Take food, water and another person should you run into trouble. The experience out there is like no other I have had. You are in a remote area, untouched by man and at the outer reaches of this hike you really feel that - you may reach an inner boundary where the spiritual and your fear meet. For advanced outdoors folks this will not be a challenge, but the bulk of folks driving through should know that this hike is not like the previous hikes in the park and requires some planning. I did that hike over 10 years ago and the imprint will never leave me. I was alone and am grateful for the experience I had there, but would not recommend that to anyone because you really are in deep trouble out there should something happen. I did not attempt it this trip.All other hikes are doable if you walk regularly.Bring a lot of film or free up your digital device because there is so much to capture. That said, remember to set the camera down and experience the presence of this part. There is true beauty and dignity offered to us here.Leave a donation for the park if you are moved by it. Our parks are severely underfunded and it is up to each of us to keep these areas available for future generations to explore.","August 29, 2016",Moving and Worth the Trip,14,Washington,5

Arches National Park,"Touring The Arches revealed one striking and unique creation of nature after another....truly remarkable. Most Arches can be easily viewed up close and personal except for the well known Delicate Arch (the unofficial symbol of Utah) With that said, it is recommended to begin your hike early in the morning before the sun/heat reaches its pea., We were informed it is about 3 miles round trip (in full sun). All the Arches that we trekked were impressive and worth the effort except The Landscape Arch (It is the longest natural arch in the world, with a span of 290.1ft.) Other than its enormous size, the long journey and final view was just okay. Overall, I want to revisit The Arches and take the trail to the Delicate Arch.

It is about 25 minutes if you drive straight through w/o stopping. Water and bathrooms are available at certain stops, but the water is tap.

The entire park will leave you awestruck!We recommend that the National Park system improve the cleanliness of the restrooms. With modern technology there must be a way to reduce/eliminate the terrible odor that was evident in every restroom we used.

My wife and I squeezed in a visit over two days and spent time hiking all the major sandstone arches in the park. Make sure to start early (8 AM or earlier ) and bring lots of water (seriously, you can never have enough). Wear comfortable clothing (Wik shirts are highly recommended) and either sneakers with good traction or hiking boots. Check out balanced rock at sunset and hike up to Delicate Arches in the AM - it's a strenuous hike, but well worth it! The Double Arches and Windows are spectacular too, but unfortunately it was cloudy at sunset the second day we were there. Regardless, it was still picturesque and amazing to witness in person. We drove around the 18 mile park the first night we got there just to get a lay of the land. I promise you will be stop repeatedly to take pictures along the way.

Although it was a nerve wrecking experience for me due to my fear of heights, I'm glad I did this trail. Totally worth it. We followed the tips to go very early (we were in the parking lot at 6am) in order to avoid the heat. Although a lot of people thought the same too, it wasn't really that crowded yet when we got there. You can still easily wait for your turn to take a picture under the Delicate Arch without having other fellow tourists on the background.

Honestly, we were going to skip the visit to Arches because of he $25/car entrance fee, but it just so happened to be FREE on the day we chose in honor of the 100th anniversary of the National Parks. It also happened to be very small crowds this day, so we scored! The visitor center is informative and the 15 minute movie worth the watch before entering the park. The park is laid out so well, you can stop for lots of photo ops. You can also take small hikes or long ones depending on your plan for the day. We only had a few hours, which allowed us to see the whole park, and still get out for a couple of the shorter hikes. We would love to come back and do some camping here too!

You can venture a short hike out of the parking lot and get some amazing views across the canyon. Not for the faint of heart as there are no rails next to canyon (this is off trail anyhow). The hike to Landscape Arch is manageable...but going beyond that needs some good footwear with treads as the rock is slippery.

This way you see the group and the majesty of the arch. Under the arch members are lost they are so small!","August 23, 2016",short but slightly strenuous heat,1,"Bryson City, North Carolina",5

Arches National Park,"Entrance fee is $25 per car. You should ensure you fill up with water at the Visitor center, as there is no other spot to get water in this park, other than the very far end of the park (18 miles away). Lots of scenic pull offs to view the scenery and various rock structures. Some you can see form the road, while others require a hike. The map provided rates all of the hikes and is very accurate as to the effort level and terrain. Hottest time of the day is 12-4pm. Very little shade in the park. Scenery and the hikes are well worth it! Hike to Delicate Arch was about 1 1/2 hours uphill.

By the time you hike up to the arch and start taking pictures the crowds begin to arrive. Go slow, don't rush...but certainly don't miss out on this trip!

Arches National Park,"What a cool National Park - SUPER easy to get to the various trail heads to hike. No need to go crazy hiking as most Arches are within a 20-30 minute hike.Best advice - do the hikes early and then drive around and take in the scenes from your car. SO much to see here!!!Delicate Arch was an easy hike, for me - in the rain or after rain would be kinda scary as the slick rock is just that - SLICK! Be warned some people think there is exposure on the hike to Delicate - I didn't think so but that's me.I really enjoyed my hike of the Arches Loop - this was a combined hike that allowed us to hike to Dark Angel - a 150' spire that is pretty awesome to see - there is def some exposure on this hike as you need to traverse some serious slick rock that is basically a ridge that you walk on for say about 200 to 300 feet - after visiting Dark Angel you can either go back the way you came and revisit the Arches or you can loop around through a more sandy aspect of the park - some tough hiking here as you are in the sand for about 60-70% of the hike.","August 23, 2016",Easy Hiking to see MANY Arches!!,60,"Bradenton, Florida",5

Arches National Park,My husband and I hiked to the Delicate Arch. I have to say that the hike was rather difficult but well worth it.

Arches National Park,"We had our two littles with us for this trip (4yo and 2yo), so we were a bit limited in what we could do as far as hiking goes. We were able to hike up to the Mesa Arch and the Windows, which were both quick and simple routes. Definitely not stroller friendly, but we were able to put our littlest in a carrier and our big one could walk it. There are a lot of the famous spots easily visible from the road, so once you hit the wall and the meltdowns begin, you can still drive around and feel like you're a part of the action.

Arches National Park,This I our 3rd visit to the park and each time we go back the park is busier and less enjoyable. The park is just not set up for the numbers visiting. There is insufficient parking to view the many fabulous features. The toilets are disgusting and need solar recirculating fans. There are insufficient picnic places. There is certainly not enough parking to cater for the walkers to Delicate Arch (the trail to the arch is badly marked). It would be sensible if a Ranger checked out walkers when they set out for adequate footwear and water and also advised walkers that those descending should give preference to those going up. Finally - why are there no seats along the sides of the tracks and near the features so that older visitors can enjoy the park and sometimes wait for the younger members of their group. I am sue that the Park is underfunded but it is too cheap - why not a $2 surcharge per head over the park fee to allow some of the essential works to be put in place.,"August 22, 2016",Amazing Park but too busy,19,"Tucson, Arizona",4

Once you reach your final destination of the Delicate Arch you'll realize that it's all worth the sweat.

Highly recommend stopping at the visitor's center and watching the 7-minute video of how the arches are formed, it gives an excellent understanding of the natural wonder that you're about to explore. The drive through the park is worth doing twice, once in the morning, once in the evening, to see how dramatically different the scenery looks at different times of the day.

Arches National Park,"We visited Arches National Park in Aug 2016. Before our tour of park we tour in a hummer which over looked Arches National Park, our tour took in Petrifieing Sand Dunes, we saw Dinosaur Tracks that had been found 150 million years after the Dinosaurs, and we learn about the area history. Truly an adventure for all ages.Behind visited center at the Arches National Park, we saw craggy sandstone that rises like a castle’s curtain wall between towers and turrets. Our scenic drive climbed high onto the plateau and crossed a vast and glorious landscape of panoramic views with distant mountains.  It's very impressive 73,234-acre wonderland of eroded sandstone fins, towers, ribs, gargoyles, hoodoos, balanced rocks, and, of course, arches northwest of Moab. The parks' amazing landscape that includes the largest proliferation of arches in the world. Over 2,000 arches (with an arch considered an opening with one side at least 3 feet wide). Landscape Arch, measuring 306 fragile feet, is the second-longest span in the world and it’s a sight you will never forget in my opinion.Elevations at Arches range from 3,960 feet along the Colorado River to 5,653-foot Elephant Butte, the park’s high point.The scenic roads that slice through the park to the many trails that wind among the 300-foot-high towers and take you to some of the most spectacular namesake making Arches National Park one of the top national parks for families with children, and a world-class vacation destination for all. Dead Horse Point is a must to take in the sunset, it is 2,000 ft above the Colorado river with breathtaking panoramic views of canyon country and pinnacles and buttes of island in the sky Distrrict of Canyon lands National park. The park is not wheelchair friendly however in my opinion for me that did'nt matter as the views was amazing. Arche National Park has been a truly wonderful experience and I can highly recommend it.

Arches National Park,"Wow!! What a great treasure! We did the very easy hike around Balanced Rock. Make sure you look up when you get around the back side of the rock--it makes you feel as though the rock will fall on you at any second!Being an adventurous crew, we also decided to take the trail to see Delicate Arch up close. To be honest, I am not a person who exercises or hikes, so this was very difficult for my 50+ year old out of shape body. A few suggestions for those who are not prime physical specimens (like most that passed me) that want to enjoy the hike: it is very hilly, so pace yourself; don't hike in midday on a 90+ degree day(my mistake); use lots of sunscreen before you go; wear a hat and have a light cotton shirt to protect your skin; bring at least two large water bottles per person and use one each way. It took me 2 1/2 hours. I would recommend a cooling towel too since the heat really got to me on the way back. All that being said, it was absolutely spectacular!

Arches National Park,"Going to Arches NP reminds me of some of the worst of going to Walt Disney World. Both places are successful and that success takes away from visitors' experiences. I found myself creating a visitation strategy just like at Disney. At Disney, you have to identify which high demand rides you are going to ride to avoid spending your day in line. At Arches, parking is the issue. I knew that since I was at Arches during the summer, that I risked not being able to park at certain attractions because the Park has insufficient parking. Therefore, I put together a plan, knowing that I needed to park in my last space around 10-11 am. The other thing is that you want to get to the Park early to avoid the crowds, as much as possible. This park seriously needs some kind of in-park mass transit, like that in the Grand Canyon. That aside, Arches reminds me of the State of New Mexico, There is a lot of fairly plain parts, but the spectacular parts are just that - spectacular and worth the hassle. We first went to the upper view of the Delicate Arch,followed by the lower view. The upper view involves going up a hill for about 0.3 mile. Save yourself the time and the effort, and stick to the lower view, which is actually better. The view from the bottom gives you a much better view.Next, we moved to the next site, the trail to the Landscape Arch. The Landscape Arch is a good reminder of how fragile the area is since parts of the arch have fallen. Another spur of the same trail took us to the Tunnel Arch and the Pine Tree Arch. All these arches are also lovely and worth the walk. By the time we came back to the car; 2 things were true. First, parking was getting problematic. Second, it was getting too hot (it was June) to keep walking around the Park, so we headed out. We also did drive-bys of the Balanced Rock both on our way in the Park and out.My takeaways were that seeing more arches was a good approach during our first visit. If I go back, I will concentrate on walking to the Delicate Arch, instead of just going to the viewpoint. Arches NP was worth a visit. I don't know that I would rate it as one of the top 5 national parks, as many have.","August 12, 2016",The Disney World of National Parks,82,"Burnet, Texas",3

Access to some of the arches - the ""Windows"" ones, as well as Turret arch - is pretty straightforward by car, then you can walk up to the arches quite easily. The hike to Delicate Arch is longer and more strenuous if you want to get close. Definitely bring lots of water and go early in the morning if you visit during the summer, as it can get very hot.

Arches National Park,"We were very lucky - we got a reservation in the Devils Garden Campground - which gave us faster access to the park - not to mention longer access. But that said - the park never closes - so anyone can come in at any time to enjoy - and of course after around 6:00 PM - it's free. The trick to avoiding the mob scene is to either do the 'popular' hikes very early or very late - or search out the less popular options like Broken Arch. We loved that hike by the way - no other people, you had to follow the cairns which made it a bit of an adventure - and you could easily go right up and under the arch. Be aware that while the part from the campground to Broken Arch is easy - if you opt for the loop - the 2nd half is moderately difficult and includes some pretty nice scrambles. But the best - aside from the Junior Ranger Program - the Fiery Furnace Hike. If you only do one thing - and you are in good shape - you must do that hike. It's the best. Hands Down.

Hiked Delicate Arch and Landscape Arch and Devils Garden early morning (different days). Hiked Tower Arch at noon with temps well over 100F. Saw only 10 people total on that 3.4 mile round trip hike so not many people as dumb as I to do it during the heat of day. Still, was wonderful to have the arch all to myself when I arrived. Saw Delicate Arch (yes, again) and Double Arch and the Windows at Sunset times. I would say that Delicate Arch, Landscape Arch and Double Arch were probably the most impressive, but all are amazing. Yes, bring a lot of water, sunscreen, hat and I hiked with a long sleeve shirt which I think helped. Best strategy is to hit the park and trails early, take a break for lunch back in Moab and rest up in your hotel during the heat of day, and then return after 5pm for hiking and sightseeing.","August 7, 2016",Amazing and Unforgettable Hikes.

Arches National Park,"Visitor Center is very modern and has a lot of interactive materials. Informative video is a must to understand what you will see. Summer time is a difficult time to visit due to the extremely high temperatures. High temperatures refrained my family and I to do the Delicate Arch hike. We did see Double Arch, the Windows, Park Avenue, Balanced Rock and the Fiery Furnace 3-hour guided tour. The guided tour was great and our guide was friendly and knowledgeable. You don´t feel the hot temperature during the hike since you are not exposed directly to the sun. Visitors must remember to bring and drink a lot of water, wear hats, hiking boots, and have sunscreen. Otherwise, you won´t be able to enjoy your hike as much as you can. We went one night to do stargazing. It was good. It is great that the park is open 24 hours.

Arches National Park,"We had a great time driving from trailhead to trailhead and taking short hikes to different arches. Park Avenue trail is fairly easy, but is not a loop, we were in two cars so we parked one at the bottom of the trail and didn't have to double back. Teens had a great time exploring around the rocks, beautiful views everywhere for the photographers. I strongly recommend having hydration packs for everyone. Consult the trail maps that you get at the park entrance, this is not flat walking and it is hot. We ranged in age from 11-71 and we were all able to get to plenty of arches and other beautiful scenery. Exhausted mom note: if your family is ""overheating"" and needs to get out of the sun and heat head back to the Visitor Center and take in the 15 minute movie.

Arches National Park,"There are lots of reviews about the wonders of Arches NP. Yes it is as spectacular as the photos; yes it is really busy in school holidays; yes it is over 100oF during the day; yes, it needs a couple of days just to see it and more days for longer walks, and yes, the daily entry fee is high. BUT, the real secret if you are driving south from I-70 to Moab is to avoid the boring signposted route and take the Jct 214 off I-70 (it is not signposted to Moab) and follow the narrow (sealed) and bumpy road for about 15km. Just when you think you might have taken the wrong turning, you will come upon the truely creepy deserted and shattered settlement of Cisco, scrawled with menacing graffiti, but oh so photogenic if you dare to stop. A little further on this road meets SR128 (also not signed to Moab). Turn left and keep driving because a few kms further this road descends into the spectacular Colorado river canyon, where it squeezes between the river and red canyon walls for another 40kms approx of stunning scenery. The river is the eastern boundary of Arches NP, so this drive provides more than a taste of the magnificent landscapes to come at Arches, Mesa Verde and Monument Valley.

Drive through, park and hike where you choose. Great pictures! Take a backpack, lots of water, good shoes, sunglasses, hike stuff, picnic items. There is a visitor center and gift shop.

Arches National Park,"I can't say anything to do justice to the Park itself, so instead here are a few tips. There are NO free buses to carry you around so a vehicle is a must. The access roads are good so your RV would be a possibility but some of the car parks close to the main attractions are a little small, so a secondary vehicle would work better. There are quite a few pleasant picnic spots but potable water fountains are scarcer so bring plenty of bottled water. The entrance to the park is slightly North of Moab but most of the RV Camps are at the extreme South end of the town, some more than five miles away and very few of them have a free shuttle service. So be careful where you book and make sure that if you don't have a secondary vehicle that you rent one in advance.

If you're not one for hiking, many of the park's attractions can simply be driven to, with minimal (to get up close) to no (if viewing from a bit of a distance suits your fancy) walking/hiking.Near the Delicate Arch parking lot, there are also Native American pictographs to be seen.Everything here is awesome.(Oh... and arrive early or during the off-season to beat the large crowds that build up in the late morning / early afternoon.)","August 4, 2016",Breathtakingly beautiful at every stop...

Arches National Park,"Arches is a great little park that has a high concentration of arches and other formations. As a result, there are many cars and people, and few places to find solitude unless you go off-trail. Ironically, Canyonlands has more total arches, but they are spread out and less accessible. The backdrop of the regularly snow-capped LaSal Mtns. to the southeast really makes for great photos. This trip was at least my 6th visit and I have seen/hiked nearly all trails (except Fiery Furnace). Plan to spend at least 3-4 hrs or more; one could probably blow through the park in 1-2 hrs if they don't get out of their cars. Landscape Arch is cool due to its thinness. The classic and not too challenging is Delicate Arch. If planning on hiking here, get a very early or very late start (don't get lost coming down) because it is the most popular in the region. Later in the day also has the sun backlighting Delicate Arch for photos.

Arches National Park,"When we left Zion, our son said, ""I can't see anything that's going to be as amazing as Zion."" He was wrong. Arches is completely different and just beautiful. We had a super fun first day with snow in the morning and 70 degree sunshine in the afternoon. The hikes were also different some Zion as we could incorporate some very easy moderate rock climbing, which was more fun for all of us. The video in the visitor's center is well worth the time as it explains how the topography of the area was formed millions of years ago. The only downside was the super slow line to get in. It seemed like the rangers were intentionally moving in slow motion and it was not that crowded but the entrance car line was excruciatingly slow. Once in the park there was not a lot of traffic or any crowds.","August 3, 2016",Stunning views. wonderful hikes,152,"London, United Kingdom",5

Arches National Park,"This is our second trip to Arches in 12 months. There is so much to do! The most important advice that I can share is to wear closed toed sneakers or hiking boots with good traction. Most trails, even the easy ones, have uneven surfaces. There are several drive up quick walks, but to get up close to the arches you need to put in effort. We returned to the park in order to take the Fiery Furnace hike. The Fiery furnace tour is great for older families. You MUST be in shape, as there is rock scrambling to do. I am 50+ and was able to do this hike with little difficulty. Tickets must be reserved 6 months in advance through the park service. There were 2 private companies doing tours while we were there, so this might be an option if you can't get on a ranger tour This is a unique experience in the park. We also came in early for a sunrise and returned for a sunset on the same day. Bring picnic foods and LOTS of water. Finally go as early in the day as you can. It gets crowded.","August 3, 2016","Awe inspiring, but please wear the correct shoes ",44,"Rochester, New York",5

Take some time and come during day as well as for sunset. drive up to the park is about 25 -30 min without traffic, can be 45 in morning. Some Arches at the turning take min 2 hours of stout walking if you want to see all 3 and up to 4 hours to linger looking over the scenery-which is worth it.","August 3, 2016",Absolutely a must see,26,"Hamburg, Germany",5
Arches National Park,"My boyfriend and I did a road trip for a week hitting the five main national parks in Utah: Zion, Bryce, Capital Reef, Canyonlands and Arches. Arches was by far the most underwhelming. You can see a lot in just a few hours by driving through and stopping at lookout points. We spent about 3 hours there and did the Devil's Garden hike (4 ish miles) and the northern lookout point for Delicate Arch. I was expecting a park full of really awesome arches and that didn't seem to be the case. I wouldn't recommend spending more than a day here based on my experience (especially if you love hiking longer distances and exploring trails with less people). If you enjoy driving through National Parks and taking great pictures without much hiking than this is a great park!On a side note, the campgrounds fill up quickly and backcountry permits are more challenging as compared to other parks due to backcountry camp opportunities (also, fire and camp stoves were prohibited in the park when we asked). There is, however, a lot of camping near the park but just outside of it. If you don't book a campsite check in the visitor center (just past the park entrance) for information. Arches is close to Canyonlands National Park which I definitely recommend! ","August 3, 2016",Underwhelming compared to others...,33,"Tunja, Boyaca, Colombia",3

I couldn't stop whispering ""WOW!"" with every single turn!! Even the switchbacks to get IN to the park!!! The long scenic road is great, with many turn offs for photo ops, trails and hikes. Although without getting out of the car, I didn't see an arch for quite a while. They don't just have them on the side of the road like a MacDonalds - you have to work for most of them and you have to work a lot harder for others (I'm looking at YOU, Delicate Arch!) - but every single one was worth it :) Saw a gorgeous sunset from the road one night, rainbows on both nights we were there, and were at Double Arch before sunrise one morning - well worth it to get there in the pitch black and experience the serenity and beauty of the changing colors.

The areas are typically readily accessible and can be seen from a distance if you have difficulty walking. Some, however, do take more extensive effort. The drive is slow so be sure to allow enough time -- just seeing the first 3 sections took us about 2-3 hours. At times it becomes very busy when large tour buses stop so also keep that in mind as that can affect your photo-taking. We were there on a hot day and it was vital to have ample water.

Arches National Park,"I had not been here in 25 years! I was able to help my elderly mom hike up to a view of Delicate Arch early in the morning and we were the only people there for awhile. This is the lesser hike, not the one that takes you to the base of the arch, but the path does climb 200 feet over uneven rocky terrain. I was able to help her up and down. At the top I hiked up some slick rock for a better view, be careful if you do that! It was so quiet and peaceful! Later we drove to all over the park, it was super hot and we drank a ton of water. We ended up doing the hike up to sit under the first Windows Arch, a must do....shady and breezy. We walked over to Turret Arch and I climbed inside and got a picture of Windows framed by Turret. I'd advise going to the park early or late in the day, as midday it's crowded and parking lots get full. You can also go at night, as the park is open 24 hours!! I did not know this, but people go in to take pictures of the stars, and do nighttime hikes. Will not wait 25 years to return! The visitor center has a great movie about the formation of the park. Also, if you go to the parks website, they have two webcams showing traffic in and out of the main road so you can see how crowded it is before you visit.

So be aware of good shoes for the whole way.","July 28, 2016",Nice but to crowded,63,"Reutlingen, Germany",4
Arches National Park,"Fantastic park but be sure to go to Visitor Center first to get help in choosing what you will do. We did not, chose a trail that was too difficult as it was not marked on the map or trailhead as to the difficulty of the trail. I almost did not make it back down. We did the Visitor Center last only to learn that we had picked the most difficult trail up to Delicate Arch.","July 27, 2016",Beautiful views But Go To Visitor Center First,35,"Naples, Florida",5

Arches National Park,"T/W last week of JulyOne of the best national parks!!We did an early morning hike to Landscape arch, Double O arch, and all the side trails. Took 4 hours, including a half hour test in the shade. Incredible rock formations, bunnies, birds and lizards, and very few bugs, but parts of the hike were tough: walking along the top of fins might be stressful for those with a fear of heights.There were plenty of parking spots when we arrived at 7:45am, and several even at noon when we left. Best to arrive closer to 6am since the temps rose to 100+ before noon.We also did the 2hr sunset hike to Delicate Arch. Near the top, there is a short section that is unnerving because of the sheer drop off along the narrow trail with people going both directions. Get there in time to photograph it with the sun's last rays. It was moderately crowded, but most hikers were friendly and courteous, and considerate when people were trying to take photos.We were pleasantly surprised that the park wasn't terribly crowded, there was never a problem finding parking, people respected the rules and Mother Earth, and the trail cairns were plentiful.","July 27, 2016",Amazing!

Arches National Park,"We arrived at about 10am and there must have been 30.+ cars in the line. Once through we went to the visitor center then into the park.There are some long and short hikes.We did park avenue which is about 2 miles total. Then balanced rock, which is short. We then did the windows primitive trail around them both. Worth doing and less busy.We also did the double arch which offered some shade.Then we went to delicate arch overlooks, the lower one is just off the car park, the higher view point is approx half a mile uphill but a reasonable view.It got so hot after 3pm we left the park and will return another day.Ensure you have lots of water as it is limited to the visitor center and the far point of the park.I also found a wallet in the park that has clearly been robbed, make sure you keep your valubles safe.","July 27, 2016",Hit hot hot,64,"Exeter, United Kingdom",5

Arches National Park,"I went here for a vacation with my family, it was such a great place to go. It is a beautiful sight created by nature. I went to all of the arches. Double arch was so fun to climb around and look at. I also went to see the Delicate Arch. It was a long, semi hard walk but completely worth it. While on the walk I was able to get a picture of the Delicate Arch through another little Arch that I found off to the side of the trail. It was truly an amazing picture. Delicate Arch itself was very beautiful to see it was enormous and it was great to take pictures of it was a tad bit crowded it eventually clears up and you're able to get some stunning pictures. This is a once in a lifetime chance. I would recommend going to see this park.","July 27, 2016",Truly amazing veiw!,0,"Moab, Utah",4

Arches National Park,"This was our first time to Arches and it is just amazing. We stopped there on our way to Denver! It costs about $25 to enter the park. You can spend as much time or as little time as you want in the park. They give you a map and information to give you sample itineraries on what sites to see based on how much time you have, which was very helpful. We stopped at the visitor center and viewed their video introduction which is a great video on the background of the arches. Then you can walk through the little museum before you head out to the various sites. We visited the windows, balanced rock, and Delicate Arch. You can drive by the sites or you can park and hike up to them and view their magnificence up close and personal! If you do that, be aware it is a lot of walking so definitely wear your tennis shoes, wear your hats, and apply your sunscreen. We went in the heat of summer in July and it was hot, with of course, no shade. We are in-shape people, but our legs were still sore the next day as we spent about 3 hours there! Arches is definitely a must-see! We stayed at a hotel in Grand Junction, which is about 1 1/2 hours away, which is a great place to stay over if you're heading toward Denver!","July 26, 2016",Amazing and must-do in Utah!,96,"North Salt Lake, Utah",5

Arches National Park,"We've been to Arches several times and it is on our list of ""must see"" parks whenever we are in the area. This time we were taking our seven year old grandson on a tour of some of the national parks, so we knew we had to take him to Arches. He loved it! The Arches are beautiful and there are hikes for different levels, as well as drive up overlooks for those who are not up to hiking. Here are my best tips, I hope they help:1. Come as early in the day as possible, especially if you are here in the summer. Summertime heat is usually in the hundreds during the middle of the day, but morning hours are usually very nice. The best time to visit is Spring or Fall if you can swing it. Also, the park can only hold so many visitors, so during the summer there are times where they will close the gates in the middle of the day until some visitors leave. If you come too late, you may have to wait to get in.2. Make sure to stop by the visitors center to get a good overview of what is the most important part of the park for you to see. Also, this is a great place to get a good understanding of the geology that formed the park and fill up your water bottles (it's free to fill your bottles). 3. You won't be able to see the entire park in one day. Park Avenue is a beautiful walk with great monoliths, but not a lot of arches. If you want to do this hike, it is better to park at the lower parking lot and walk up. Most people park at the top and walk down, but it is a really steep hike back to the car.4. At the beginning of the day everyone goes straight to double arch and it gets so crowded you can't see anything (or even park). If you go further back to delicate arch or devil's garden and see these first you should have a lot less crowd. Then go up to double arch later in the day while everyone else is at delicate arch and devil's garden. We always love the devil's garden hike, but it is 7.2 miles. If you are not up to the full hike, at least do a little of it. It is well worth it!5. One of the best arches is in the campground. There is parking right outside of the campground, so you can hike into it if you are not staying.6. If you are staying at the campground, make reservations on recreation.gov six months in advance or you probably won't get in.7. There is not a lot of picnicking in the park; however, there is one small place right across from Balanced Rock. It shows up on the map as .3 miles down a gravel road. I think that is why it is not very crowded. The road is very nice and it is just right there. You have a beautiful view, there is a nice table under a Juniper tree, as well as three tables under a covered area. There is also a toilet facility here. When we went this last time it was $25 per vehicle for those who did not have their parks pass ($80 yearly pass, $10 Senior Pass, or Disabled Pass). This entrance fee allowed reentry for seven days.","July 26, 2016",A Must See!,57,"Safford, Arizona",5

Keep in mind that hikes that are short tend to attract those who have no clue how to hike (including basic manners and etiquette). You will see people breaking rules. I saw drones, walking off trail, climbing on arches and more. There are very few rangers around. As a guy who LOVES National Parks some of this was quite disturbing but par for the course.

It's a tough climb to the top, it's going to take a few hours to properly appreciate it, but it's very satisfying when you get it done. After that, I'd go to Landscape Arch, shorter walk, but equally impressive. There are other trails around Landscape Arch, so you can spend several hours here as well. Remember, in the afternoon, it gets very hot, many people struggle to walk around the trails in the afternoon.

The guide you get from the entrance rangers will highlight 1/2, 1 and multi day visiting options. Caution - we were there when it was 110'-115' F each day. Listen to the rangers and pack in enough water and salty snacks when you're hiking in these temps. Go early in the day! You'd be amazed at how fast temps climb once the sun is up and beating on the rocks. There are a lot of camping options outside the park on National Forest Land.

There are so many hikes of different ability levels for all members of the family. The surrounding vegetation is very cool, too. My girls loved all the lizards we saw. Let the visitor's center help you plan. Our family favorite was Double Arch at sunset. The light can't be described in words. You have to be there! My 10-year old daughter was truly speechless as we watched the sun set until the last glimmer of light.We spent about 1 full day over two days to catch early mornings and evenings We did several hikes in that time. Each arch has something special to offer. Be aware it gets very hot and busy during the day. Take plenty of water. Our only disappointment was missing out on the Fiery Furnace guided hike because those trips had been booked for months.We were super impressed with the fact that Arches has recycling everywhere for all those water and drink bottles.

It took us 2 hours and we went through 2 bottles (1 one refillable bottle ) each of us. Granted, we are from a state that is at sea level so the elevation killed us.

We drove the entire park and visited several times. Let's start with the drive. If you have time, drive the entire length and soak up the panoramic views. Take time to stop at the view points and take lots of photos. We did lots of hiking trails: The Windows, Double Arch, Sand Dune Arch, Skyline Arch and Balanced Rock. **The Windows is an easily one mile trail to the north and south windows and turret arch.**Double Arch is a half mile easy trail through some loose sand. ** Sand Dune Arch is a 0.3 mile hike and great for kids and those young at heart. **We really loved this hike** For the most part, this is shaded. This hike goes deep inside the sandstone fins leading to a secluded arch within. **Skyline Arch is a 0.4 mile hike on a flat trail. This is an easy hike over rocks to get a closer view of the arch. Great photo spot!**Balanced Rock is a 0.3 mile loop hike at the base of picturesque rock formation. You'll scratch your head wondering how that rock balances itself. Every turn on the road leads to another spectacular view. The Petrified Dunes, Rock Pinnacles, Courthouse towers area are just jaw-dropping! No words can effectively describe the locations.Please stay on the trails to protect the ecosystem. Bring plenty of water to drink. Leave only your footprints!

Arches National Park,"We stayed in Moab for a few days in July, so we were just a few miles from the entrance to Arches National Park - this meant that is was pretty easy to come and go throughout the day. The first day, we arrived in the park at about 5 am and hiked out to Delicate Arch. There were plenty of people there when we arrived, but it was still quite peaceful. Also, it was easy for everyone who wanted a picture by the arch to get one and there was plenty of time when no one was by the arch so people who wanted to snap people-less pictures could do so. After that hike, we drove around a bit and hit a few highlights like the Windows, the Double Arch and Balanced Rock and then went back to Moab during the heat of the day. We went back out to the park near sunset and hiked the Park Avenue trail - we allowed enough time to do the whole trail before dark, but had headlamps with us just in case (this would not be a good place to get lost at night). The weather had cooled off to the lower 90s, but with the dry heat and no direct sunlight, it was quite comfortable.The next morning we got to the park around 4:00 am (this was difficult, but worth it) and set up our camera to take pictures of the Milky Way. After it had faded, we walked up to the North Window Arch where we watched the sun rise. I highly recommend this - the only noise was the wind and some coyotes until the birds started singing as the sky brightened. We had the arch to ourselves until the sun was up. Once people began showing up we went back to Moab for a nap before moving on to Canyonlands.I would definitely recommend spending some time in Arches National Park.

They really needed either a rope or a ladder to climb. We also found that a trail to make a loop started behind a camp site and was not well marked.

If you want a treat, go in the spring or the fall to get the effect of shadows on the many arches. It's beautiful during midday, but seeing them with the sun lower in the sky adds a dimension that is almost mystical. I've been to the Arches so many times I can't count them, but I almost always went midday, took a picnic, and planned for the whole day.

Some suggestions: the Delicate Arch hike is doable, but just bring LOTS of water and be prepared to climb uphill for 500 feet. For children, the sand dune arch or the double arch, I think, is best to go to. Go at night to the panoramic point and watch the stars come out.

Arches National Park,"My wife and I just finished a road trip that included among other places Arches, Zion, Bryce, Dinasour, Monument Valley… Arches was awesome. You get some incredible views here even if you never get 100 feet from your car. You get even more incredible sights if you are willing to walk short distances like ½ mile. The visitors center is great. Make sure you take a little time here and I recommend you take advantage of the flush toilets and top off you water bottles or hydration packs or buy some while you are here. There are pit toilets out in the park and water at at least one of the trailheads but not everywhere. We spent over 6 hours in the park. We drove everything available, stopped at at least ½ of the turnouts, and took 4 hikes. 3 of the 4 were more of a walk than a hike. Here are my walking/hiking recommendations. Double arch is a must see. The walk is easy so just do it. It was our favorite. We did the upper overlook trail for Delicate arch. I think you need to actually hike to Delicate arch to appreciate it and I question whether the hike is worth giving up the time unless you have enough time to do it and everything else too. Sand Dune arch is small but the short hike to it is fun as it is in a slot canyon. I recommend it. The Hells Furnace area looks to be super fun. We were not able to get on the tour as it was booked a week out. If you only had one day I’m not sure I would sacrifice everything else for it but if you had at least half of a second day I would go for it. What is interesting is that the website in my opinion makes it sound like they reserve ½ of the spots for this tour for “walk-up” reservations but that is not true. They reserve ½ of the spots up until 10 days before the tour so call and get a spot before you go and then try again 10 days before your visit if needed. The last area we visited was at the far North end. We hiked to Landscape arch and then out to Double O arch. Landscape arch is not too far and I felt it was worth it as it definitely has a super long spindly how is that still standing look to it. Double O arch while not as impressive as Double arch was still unique and what I loved about this arch was the hike and the fact that we only had one other couple at the arch and they were only there a short time. All the other arches were much more crowded. The hike was fantastic in that the trail is a little hard to follow with a fair bit of boulder scrambling and a “fin” you had to walk across that made you feel very exposed as it has a decent 20’ drop on one side and a good 100’ drop on the other. You really feel like you are in the middle of nowhere and truly exploring on this hike. I was happy we took the time to do this one (about 2 hours). I wish we had more time available at the park to do more hiking and to see more arches. In hindsight a 1.5-2 day allotment would have been better. My hot weather tip is to wet your hat before you leave on a hike/walk. Keep a plastic bag in the car to hold you hat with some water poured on it. I hope you found this review helpful.

We did double arch again easy walk. We did the sand dune arch then went to broke arch. I'd recommend always having the trail map. We saw a big arch but thought this isn't broken so we kept going another half mile. We did the delicate arch which was amazing. It's a moderate hike uphill on a slick rock. Both of my kids 9 and 4 did great. The end is around a steep cliff. I was a little freaked out with the little one but it was fine. Once up at the top, it's breath taking. I have to say there were some crazy people just running around. I had to look away bc I was sure that they were going to fall. We did landscape arch early in the morning on our last day.

After 4pm or early in the morning is the best time to visit because its the desert and it's hot! Bring a hat, sun screen, and plenty of water.

Arches National Park,"This park is all about easy. It is a quick drive to the entrance from Moab. Once you're in the park, the drives to all the main sights are also effortless. There are lots of places to turn off to take photos, there is plenty of parking at the main sights, and we didn't find any particular place to be crowded. We were surprised at how close you can get to some of the main Arches, especially Double Arch and Delicate Arch. It was 105 degrees both days we were there, so we split up our day by going in the morning, taking the afternoon off, then coming back early evening. Because of the heat, we only did hikes that were a mile or less, but there were plenty of them and we felt we got to see so much. If you don't like to do a lot of hiking, you will still see a lot of very interesting natural formations in this park.","July 11, 2016",Easy to get around,84,"Lansing, Illinois",5

Good afternoon shade and cool breezes. Eat lunch at one of the Arches, however be prepared to pack out your trash. MAKE YOUR KIDS respect the park. The park is fragile and kids climbing, marking the walls with their names will find that someone will report them. RESPECT the park. It will be a great experience. Do the Ranger led Fiery Furnace hike. Great 3hr, 2 mile hike loaded with at least 12 challenging obstacles. Made for all age groups as long as you are in desent shape.

Our grandsons talked us into the Delicate Arch hike which we later discovered was actually labeled a difficult hike! We thoroughly enjoyed it, and we were proud of ourselves for finishing. It was worth every step! However, we did not take enough water. Two liters recommended. It is the dessert! The park ranger commented that our puny water bottles were not adequate, and after completing the hike I totally agree. We were dry, hot, thirsty. But we LOVED Arches.

Arches National Park,"On our way out of Moab, we stopped by Arches National Park. It's located just outside of Moab - approx. 5 mins. I would advise to go as early as you can in summer due to the heat. Avoid mid-day. The park is open 24 hours so we went just after sunrise and the temperature was still cool and made the hikes much easier. You can go online and see which formations are best to see in the a.m. and which ones to see at sunset to catch the best light. They are spectacular when the sun hits the rocks!If hiking the longer trails, make sure to bring plenty of water. Visitor Center opens at 7:30 a.m. but you can enter the park earlier than that as it is open 24 hours.Our favorite Utah National Park is still Zion but Arches is very much worth seeing.

Arches National Park,"As usual, we took a drive through the Arches to scout out which areas we would hike. It is still extremely hot, in 100's, so we looked for short hikes that we could do early in the mornings. After our drive through, we left before sunrise the next day to get to some of the hiking trail heads before the heat became too intense. We only did two trails before the temperature got into the 90's. Windows and Double Arches. In spite of the early hour, there were people at the Windows Arch waiting to take photos of the sunrise. Be sure to go early since the entrance backs up for hours. This is a MUST SEE park.","July 10, 2016",Landscapes from Another World,364,"Melbourne, Florida",5

Arches National Park,"We have visited a lot of Parks over the years but this is probably my favourite. It is not a quick visit and you should allow a minimum of three hours and more if you want to hike out to some of the further arches. There are a lot you get good views of from a short wander from the overlooks. I don't know how many arches there are in total but is a lot. There are many more things apart from arches and I ended up with more than a hundred photos. Be warned, the temperature was above 100F while we were there so take a lot of water. This is a gem in the wonderful system that is the National Parks. ","July 9, 2016",What more could you ask?,89,"Scottish Borders, United Kingdom",5

In fact, I recommend staying at night through sunset - it is beautiful. One morning, I hiked to Delicate Arch with my family(wife and 3 children - 14, 11 and 8). I was at the trailhead at 6 am. I was back in my car at 8 and I was sweating - it was hot at 8. Even at 6 am, while it was certainly not crowded, there was quite a number of people on the trail. The final night, we went to double arch and it was amazing. It is so beautiful early and late in the day. My family and I did two hikes - Delicate Arch and Park Avenue - and it was wonderful.

Arches National Park,"Prior to visiting the park, I did extensive online research to decide what activities to do within our time budget. In the end, this made the difference. Knowing which Arches we wanted to see and which hikes were right for us helped us get the most out of our visit. Given the wide range of intensity levels, I recommend planning ahead.The entrance to the park was not crowded when we entered, despite it being high summer. There was some traffic getting up the first hill (which, by the way is an amazing road!), but it eased up immediately after. The Visitor's Center was packed, and we made the decision to stop there on the way out.It is nearly 18 miles from the gate to the far end of the park, with two additional roads adding another 10 miles to loop through. Along the way, there are various viewpoints to stop off at, so the time spent driving is never more than a few minutes.For those with mobility issues or wishing to take it easy and not wander far from the car, you can stick to the road and stop off at viewpoints. These, in my opinion, are worth making the trip. To see any actual arches, aside from a distant view of Delicate Arch, it does require hiking ranging from 400 feet for Skyline and Sand Dune Arches, to miles out to the remote parts of Devil's Garden. For this reason, I again recommend researching and planning ahead.Some of my favorite spots were Double Arch, Skyline Arch, and Sand Dune Arch. All were easily accessible and really neat. The entire drive was fascinating, from the hill into the park to driving between various monolithic rock formations. Between the two of us, we took around 400 photos.I highly recommend this park, especially to people who enjoy moderate hiking and venturing out to see nature's beauty.","July 3, 2016",Plan Ahead To Fully Appreciate Arches,54,"Long Beach, California",5

Our only disappointment was the arch billed as the longest one. It was a pretty long hike round-trip, and it was not nearly as spectacular as all of the others. Yes it was a long span, but it was hard to get any sort of perspective of it without almost getting down under it, so you could see the sky through the arch.

Our first day we arrived at the park at 4:30pm and found that the ticket booths were empty and the gate was open. In addition to no cost, it was cooler and the shadows from the sun being low in the sky were magnificent! We stayed for a couple of hours before heading back to Moab for dinner. In hot weather it is nice to go early in the morning, leave for an air-conditioned lunch in Moab (Spoke was great) and then come back late afternoon evening (you do not have to pay again and no lines...). If you are coming off of a long car ride with kids, the Windows section is a great place to start as it has a wonderful area where the kids can climb up into one of the most spectacular Double Arches (pictures included). On the second day we did the Sandstone Arch, the Devils Garden (Landscape Arch will not be around much longer) and the Delicate Arch. The park overall is pretty small and packed with wonders, so even if you are in the area and only have an hour, it is worth just driving through and staying in the air conditioned car.

Delicate arch was a letdown considering you see it on all the advertisements. The views (we didn't do the long hike) are from too far away to really see it well. The short, steep hike from the parking lot to a viewpoint is also too far away. I thought all the other arches were more amazing.

It's not so much the heat but the position of the sun. More shade available when it is lower in the sky. This walk is a complete assault on the senses. At times you will think you are on another planet. It is phenomenal. It is a bit tricky at times whilst negotiating some slickrock surfaces and if doing it clockwise you would definately lose your way once past the Double O Arch if it weren't for the small cairns (little stone piles) pointing the way. We took 3 litres of water each and used every drop. They're not kidding about the amount you'll need. My tip is that if you are actually going early, don't get drawn in to some of the more famous arches viewpoints. Get to the Primitive loop trail head car park and plod on.

Arches, WOW! (getting the idea?) We arrived in Moab late afternoon and were told at the motel the place gets packed in the AM. We decided to visit that evening, not so crowded then. Good idea. Truly beautiful! Figure about 3-4 hours if not hiking. We have nothing like this in PA. We found that as we visited each park the only word we could come up with was WOW each time.

Arches National Park,"Put this on your national park top 10. God's creativity is seen through out this magnificent place. We arrived early to take a free 9:00am ranger talk/walk. Ranger Dominick (Dom) presented an engaging, well organized talk which included visual aids. He taught us the importance of staying on trail in this unique environment. One hundred years of soil maturation is destroyed with one step! Don't bust the crust. Don't hurt the dirt. Ask a ranger for more info. It was hot - in the mid 80's when we arrived and 106 degrees when we left before noon!!! Water-water-water is a must. Check the trail maps before you head out. What we ""assumed"" would be a short hike in Devil's Garden was 7, heat stroke inducible, miles. I missed the Delicate Arch. I wish I had gone to it at least for a distant view.

Arches National Park,"Arches National Park is a breathtaking expanse of western desert. With over 2000 natural stone arches and numerous other formation, Arches should be at or very near the top of your list. This is the largest and most concentrated collection of stone arches anywhere on earth.We had visited once with our kids about 10 years ago and were unable to do a few of the more challenging hikes. This time, with just a day and just my wife and I, we chose the hike to Delicate Arch, the iconic state symbol for UT. Leaving early to beat the worst of the heat, the hike is about 1.5 miles out to the arch with close to 500 feet in elevation gain. Just past the 1/2 way point is the toughest part of the hike, with a short steep climb. For the height sensitive, the last challenge is a rock ledge just wide enough for two people to pass comfortably, finally revealing the arch after a final turn. Don't miss the relatively easy, short climb to Frame Arch just above the trail near the end for a framed view of Delicate Arch.For a very different perspective, a short but very steep clamber around the backside of the arch provides a challenging but rewarding view most won't see. DO NOT do this if you are not comfortable with steep slick rock climbs with few handholds. Good, solid, well fitted hiking shoes are a MUST for this.","June 23, 2016",One of the most amazing places on the planet,115,"Hampstead, MD",5

We started around 7:30 and left a little after 1:00 pm. We could have spent more time, but the park was starting to get a bit crowded and we had other attractions we wanted to see.

Delicate Arch is the most famous arch in the park and worth the 1 1/2 mile hike to get to it.

Even so we packed plenty of water for everyone on every hike.

Arches National Park,"I have long been a champion of the National Parks, but this was disappointing. I found the rangers to be rather haughty, the facilities inadequate, and we did not even have the chance to visit two of the points due to a lack of parking. An entire family of women jammed themselves into the family bathroom while I waited outside with my toddler son, because the line for the women's room was too long. No kidding. My family almost got run over by a tour bus. The requirements for earning a Junior Ranger badge included picking up trash, which was found nowhere; my kids have to pick up trash? Probably the cigarette butts left by people smoking outside of the Visitors' Center? This park is in desperate need of crowd control, but they will not even correct people going behind their desk to take pictures of the posters. They need a tram like Zion or the Grand Canyon, for starters. The facility clearly cannot handle the number of visitors, and clearly the rangers feel powerless to protect the land. It's not an amusement park, it's not there for selfies, it's to be cherished and admired. We were better off spending out time at Moab Giants, and we should have made the drive to Needles instead. I just don't know why the rangers had to have such a rude demeanor towards me and my kids. Very disappointed in you, Arches, and it breaks my heart, because I love the parks.

Arches National Park,"We went o Arches while on a tour of western National Parks. Arches has some spectacular landscapes to admire. There are many hikes one could choose to do or you could just keep it simple and drive through the park and get out at the scenic overlooks. We only did one hike, to Delicate Arch. We started earlier in he morning, which is the only time I would suggest starting due to the temperature that it could get to in the afternoon. It is a short hike, only 3 miles round trip, but the climb up can be a bit challenging as it is somewhat steep. There are a few places you are close to a cliff edge so keep the kids close. The view of the arch is awesome when you get there. Most people were nice and taking turns going into the arch for photos. Take water and wear decent shoes (not flip flops). I would say that one day is enough for a visit to the park. While in the area spend another day visiting Canyonlands National Park as it is just a few miles away.

There is no food in the Park. Also check the difficulty rating of your hike before heading out. The difficult ones are exactly what they say - difficult.

Caveats (not complaints, adding food services or running water probably isn't feasible or necessary)-little or no access to food in the park...pack a lunch!

There weren't too many rangers out to ask questions, but the maps and newspaper are helpful.

Arches National Park,"...BUT, loud, obnoxious tourists with and without selfie-sticks has made enjoying the park much more difficult. I've been coming here for over 20 years, and it's gotten more and more crowded over the years. They've doubled the parking spaces at the trail to the Delicate Arch, mainly for RVs, but that tells you something about the popularity of this wonderful place.People, when you visit Arches, please be respectful of those around you. There's no reason to be loud and obnoxious, ordering people to pose certain ways at the Balancing Rock. Yes, it's balancing, and it's cute if you can get your finger just right in the pose to hold the rock up, but there's no reason at all to be noisy about it.If you want the very best experience at Arches, hike early and hike late, but avoid the late morning and early afternoon crowds. Besides that, it's too hot to hike at those times. My son and I typically go to the local swimming hole around noon, and come back to hike closer to dusk. We did the Delicate Arch hike at 6:30 in the morning, and the parking lot was already half full, so it shows you how many early morning enthusiasts there are.I will always love Arches, and hope that its popularity doesn't drive me away.

Arches National Park,"We booked this 5 hour ""off road"" trip up and understood that it was not visiting the ""iconic sights"" of Arches. What we didn't expect was a bone rattling 5 hours ""back country"" journey. There is a difference between off road and back country . Please be aware that this is not suitable if you have any back issues. When I commented the following day to the office I was spoken to rather sharply and told that it was advertised as back country and what did I expect. I expected to be spoken to politely and not to basically be called a liar when I said it was advertised through Viator as off road.Also we started 15 minutes early and finished 15 minutes early so in fact lost 30 minutes . We passed some of the iconic sights whilst returning to head office and so there would have been time for our driver to stop there, especially as these vista points were not crowded rather than cutting shorts our tour. Our driver did an excellent job of driving the vehicle but didn't interact with us, it was hard work to get a conversation going with himIf you do not have time to self drive the scenic route and do an organised trip I suggest you stick to doing things yourself.As for the arches in Arches only seeing a few of them back country I can't comment of the more famous ones as never got to see them","June 15, 2016",navtec 5 hour trip disappointing,198,"London, United Kingdom",2

The hike to The Spectacles was warm but easy and the primitive trail was a treat because we met only 2 others on that alternate path. Take photos of The Spectacles and then turn and shoot the view that includes the LA Sal mountains. Further up the drive we hiked the Landscape Arch. Met a very friendly Ranger with good advice. This trail was packed with bus tour clients and people who wanted to see something but may not have been properly prepared with adequate water. On the way down, we saw a near accident with a driver too much in a hurry to exit a parking lot. Slow down and enjoy the beauty of this park.

That scared me a bit, but I was just fine on the hike. It is superb. Double O Arch at Devil's Garden is my 2nd favorite. I did not want to do the Primitive Trail. It may be clear to everyone, but it was not to me. To the right of Landscape Arch you see the sign Primitive Trail. You need to climb the big fin - like climbing on top of a whate's back---once you get up that rock, the trail is quite well marked. Don't do it alone. By about 9 am there are people around, not at 7 am. It's a great hike. The Windows arch trail was very crowded with bus tours. If you are hiking with someone, get to the park by 7 am- then it is cool and not crowded. In June, I always found a parking spot at each spot.

If I come again, I'll do the ranger hikes as those are often amazing. That said, I have been to many other national parks that I love so much more. And there are many arches nearby.

At one place you get to see the wilderness, landscapes of exceptional beauty. The best time is sunrise and sunset. You get all the glow over these structures and the sites are mesmerizing!!

Arches National Park,"This park has so much to see you really need a couple days to explore. Highly suggest to get to the park early at first light and do your research as to what rock formations to see first and last as most of them have the sunlight shining on them at certain times. Landscape arch is lit in the early morning sun whereas in the afternoon it will be in full shadow. There's plenty of information of the internet as to when to see each formation and good times to photograph. The rock formations themselves are extraordinary to say the least. From rock arches (sometimes double arches) to balanced rocks and massive rock walls, there is literary hundreds of sights to behold. Word of warning – in summer time this place gets thousands of visitors everyday so carparking, as much as the NPS have expanded some of the carparks, is difficult at times particularly at the more frequented sights such as the Windows section and Delicate Arch. Plan your day to make most of the day and remember also to take plenty of water and snacks. Everything is accessible by car however many of the places require some walking to get out to see the rock formations. The Devils Garden area for example have hikes that take several hours so be prepared for long hikes and be appropriately prepared for the day. Awesome memorable experience.","June 14, 2016",Rock formations that defy logic,175,"Melbourne, Australia",5

We then returned around 6.30pm to go to the Windows area where the setting sun illuminates the three large arches only a quarter of a mile from the parking area. The next day we arrived at the Park before 8am to hike to Landscape Arch before the crowds arrived 1-2 hours later. A further simple flat 1.3 mile round-trip walk was rewarded with perfect views of the unique Sand Dunes Arch and Broken Arch. We would strongly recommend arriving before 8.30am and/or going a few hours before sunset for the best light, coolest conditions for hiking and to avoid the lengthy queues to enter the park after 8.30am.","June 13, 2016",Absolutely fabulous scenery,313,"Harrogate, United Kingdom",5

The long roads into the park offer many opportunities to stop and wonder at the amazing rock formations and landscape. The Delicate Arch walk is probably the most popular, but should be done. The more lengthy and strenuous Devil's Garden walk will take you past many more different formations over a 4-5 hour period. Take a picnic and plenty of water and immerse yourself in the surrounding beauty for a day or two at least.

Arches National Park,"While I am a very fit adult, I have a close friend with cerebral palsy. The set-up at Arches is nice because there are good views for people who are only comfortable of level surfaces, and there are also more strenuous hikes available for people who want a challenge. Double Arch (at the ""Windows"" look-out) was probably the favorite for our group. There wasn't much of a walk to get there, and it was a nice, easy stroll with lots of views on the approach. With that said, I couldn't resist taking a quick climb, and found a nice spot to scramble just a bit. I was still within clear view (and earshot) of my friends, so nobody was left behind. Landscape Arch was a longer stroll, but still not very difficult. The lookout for Delicate Arch was a little disappointing. It looks so tiny at that distance that it doesn't live up to its pictures.That said, more time and a little muscle would have afforded us opportunities to get closer to ALL of the arches here. Next time, I would like to get right up close to Delicate Arch, as we could (from our distance) see others doing. We only had one day here, but this location could easily take up the better part of a week. ","June 11, 2016",Beauty for explorers at every level of ability.,84,Chandler,5

We lucked out getting an overcast day in 80s. We read to get to park by 8am to get parking at Windows or Delicate Arch. That is true. We went to Delicate first then to Windows.

Then went back into Moab (5 miles away) for lunch, to explore town a bit and take a nap! We picked up sandwiches and fruit in town then drove back into the Park around 6 pm. Hiked a bit more and stayed for sunset. If we hadn't been so tired we would have stayed until it was really dark since we had read how awesome the night sky is with all the stars.

Arches allows you to drive in between the cliffs and ""monuments"", walk up to the arches and explore the stunning geological structures close up. Start by driving the entire inner road end to end. This will help you to get your bearings and determine the areas you want to hike or look at closer.

The most famous of all arches, the delicate arch (the iconic one that is on the license plates of Utah) requires a 1.5 mile one way hike to view close up. There are other views of the arch in which the hike isn't as long, but you don't get nearly as close. I've attached a picture from the upper viewing area which is close as you can get without taking the longer 1.5 mile hike. There are other arches (e.g. windows arch) which don't require as strenuous a hike, but you do need to walk a bit to get the close up view. I think all of the hikes are worth it.Now the bad part, the crowds. The line to get into the park was long. We went at 10:00am on a Saturday. They say go before 9:00am or after 4:00pm to avoid the worse of it. The NPS website has a webcam in which you can view the line to get into the park before you go. Even better if you have a National Park's Pass (Dad did) you can avoid the long line and get right in. Even so, the parking lots at the various attractions are full and you have to sometimes wait to find a space. Then you have to navigate your way through the throngs of people on the paths, many who are absorbed on their phones neglecting watching wear they are going. My personal peeve is the smokers who toss their cigarette butts in the dirt of the surrounding trails. Really? Is it worth it? Yes of course. Words cannot describe the beauty of this place. My advice? Be patient. Know you might have to wait a bit, but it will save you the aggravation if you are prepared. If you can, go during off hours. And be prepared to wait for a parking space, bring plenty of water, be ready for the heat of summer (often the temperature is in excess of 100) and for god's sake, wear a hat!","June 7, 2016",Crowded but Beautiful!,39,"Denver, Colorado",5

Good hiking trails, be advised their ""easy"" in the map is NOT completely easy. I would cetainly rated some as moderate, Rock steps, loose gravel, always pay attention to your steps. We did a 3 mile hike, and made it completely. Not in perfect shape. Short breaks to let the knees and hips recover from the shock of activity. Time your time and you be fine for the older folks.

Arches National Park,"While Arches NP can be a busy park, it's definitely not as busy as Zion NP was at the same time. The key to the park is going where the crowds aren't. I know that seems intuitive, but apparently not. The key is doing all of the really popular places (Delicate and Double Arch) either early or at the end of the day, as most people won't want to get out there early in the day.

We did walk to the Upper Viewpoint of the Delicate Arch and took pictures from there. It was not to bad but would have been better if we could of had the time and energy to hike all the way to it. The other arches in the park were amazing and splendid. We walked to a few short ones and I would say double arch was the coolest. I really liked it here.

And best of all, you'll have the place almost entirely to yourself - very few people leave the parking lot overview area.Stop to take a look at the Petrified Sand Dunes, which truly do look like something from another planet.Take the short hike to see Ute petroglyphs, and the remains of Wolfe Ranch cabin (1898).Finally, consider returning at night.

I climbed to the top of the double arch which was great fun and then walked across the parking lot to the windows. Also awesome views of the land beyond. It was a little frustrating you couldn't get some of the pictures they have in the glossy brochures but just to be there was enough. We drove on to Delicate viewpoint but did not attempt the trek to the arch itself. At the viewpoint you are quite far away so if you can and have the time I think it would be worth doing.

We went on a guided hike in Fiery Furnace, which I recommend due to the lack of a clearly designated path. I'm sure it's fun to hike without a guide, but be prepared to get lost for a few hours. There are restrictions on the number of users, so check into it weeks in advance if you want to do the Fiery Furnace.

(My favorite arch was the Double Arch). Get there early, before 9 at the latest or expect a line at the entrance and difficulty parking. Expect a lot of people; it seems more popular than Canyonlands (but that one's great as well). You can see a lot in one day but if you take the longer hikes you'd want two. And don't forget the nighttime. We came back after dinner, around 10 on a moonless night, to view the night sky. Pulled over in one of the parking areas, let our eyes adjust and leaned back against the car looking up. What a display. Something you'll rarely see elsewhere in this world of light pollution.

Did the roughly 1+ hour hike to get to Delicate Arch and was rewarded with a great view. Took a bunch of photos and then quite rapidly a whole bunch of people arrived. It seemed that each person wanted a personal photo of them in the middle of Delicate Arch. That's cool but I was not that excited about a picture with that person smack dab in the middle of the arch. Like I said, fortunately I had gotten several before the crowd arrived.Coming down from Delicate Arch, I went off trail and ended up on the back side of the bowl that Delicate Arch is situated in. It was interesting to see it from that angle. When I got back to the car (about 11am) the parking lot was full (it's a big lot btw) and people were waiting for someone to leave.

It's straight uphill and not too hard, just seems long. There is a small ledge at the top which people with a fear of heights don't like. But I saw a family helping the mother taking it very slowly, and clinging to the rock. People are respectful of that. Going down you just have to wait til people ahead of you clear out so you can go back the same way quickly. But this hike is sooo worth it.

Arches National Park,Spectacular National Park with lots of amazing rock formations and most notably arches. The trail to Delicate Arch is popular and exhausting. Try to go before 0900 or after 1700 to avoid the summer heat. Probably better to visit the park in the winter of r spring. The trail is tough going but the sight of Delicate Arch after 1.5 miles is worth it. The othe major sites are much easier to walk to and many can be seen from the tar aced roadway.

We were planning on driving to the viewing area for Delicate Arch, but it had rained the night before and the road was closed so we did not get to see this iconic arch.

We drove to all spots to take a quick look for next day's visit, and the park was almost empty, no crowds to beat. We actually got to see quite a few places and noted down what else to see for the next day. So, on the next day, we got in again in the morning knowing where to go. We spent most of the time on the trail to see a few arches in the Devil's Garden.

I made 3 trips around the loop trying to find a parking spot and finally gave up. Early morning was fine, but as the park became more and more full of people, I didn't like it quite as well.

There are short and long trails (as you would expect the popular ones are the best viz delicate arch, windows etc. But none disappoint - look at map you are given at the entrance and get more information at the visitor centre, but best advice of all is avoid visiting in the middle of the day especially at weekends as the crowds spoil it both for the wait to enter and also for parking places on the way round.

We did go to the Arch viewpoint for a great view of the arch and of lot's of people that hiked in. We then went to the Tower Arch trail. Because we were in our Jeep we were able to escape the crowds and have the park and it's amazing backcountry scenery to ourselves. We drove over some very challenging trails and had a wonderful time.

Arches National Park,"The centerpiece of our 2016 vacation, our trip to Arches National Park (ANP), started with a view of their visitor game webcam, as we were concerned about crowds. We were in the park by 7:30, which I highly recommend (less visitors, cooler temp, more parking.)For those new to the park, you drive quite a lot from the gate to the views. We decided that Delicate Arch, The Windows, and Balanced Rock would be our goals. I have heard great things about Devils Garden and Landscape Arch, but we knew we didn't have another 2-3 hours in us. We set a 6 hour goal, and our plan worked great.Ample signage helps you drive in the park. You will want to slow down to take it all in, the monolithic red and slickstone formations throughout the drive.Delicate Arch is a bit of a strenuous hike. Paths are well documented, and it is very well traveled. Lots of kids and parents. Reaching the Arch is breathtaking, views of such majesty it is humbling. I had several zen moments of self reflection and appreciation for the Earth and its delicate design, so do this trail as the work pays off with stunning admiration.The Windows is an easier hike, perhaps 15 minutes, with the awe-inspiring Double Arch a short 5 minute walk. It is hard to describe, but the Windows is so family accessible and fun to move around (Turret Arch is in the same area) that you can easily spend 2 hours with 4 different arch formations. There is just more to do in The Windows area.Balanced Rock, which is viewable from The Windows, was our last monolith and in some ways, the unsung hero of the park. It's unique formation we were able to walk completely around, and the different views and closeness to it was the perfect ending to the day.ANP is a jewel in America.

Arches National Park,"superb scenery -- even better if you follow the trails a bit. It's not that big, but it certainly has lots of natural arches = natural bridges. The visitor center is well worthwhile. Until we talked to a ranger, we had no idea that much of the road trip in ""Thelma and Louise"" was filmed within Arches. Since the trip we have watched the movie and enjoyed seeing Arches in the background of many shots. Many arches scan be seen from the road; others really need a short walk, suitable even for small children.","May 24, 2016",great scenery,15,"Thousand Oaks, California",5

Arches National Park,"I love to go into the park and explore. I take friends to Delicate Arch, the fiery furnace and special places I have explored. Unfortunately Arches has been discovered and resembles and ant hill with all the tourists. If you are going to go to the part the earlier the better for the major attractions (and that doesn't mean 9:00 PM it means 6:00 PM in the summer months).","May 24, 2016",Has some unique rock formations,0,,5
Arches National Park,"Awesome! You pay the entrance fee, drive through, perhaps stop at the visitors center (movie and guides) and then BAM your in the park. From the vehicle it's amazing. Any photographers dream. But once you park and get out - becomes a whole other universe. Here are my favorites... For the kids - Sandstone arch. You hike hardly nothing. Like nothing. And then take a right up to this arch surrounded by sand and in a cave like structure. The kids could play here for hours, your in the shade, the sand feels good on your feet, you can hike around, etc. For the tourist - Duh! Delicate arch but don't be the ninny that goes to the view below. Hike up there. I see shapes of all sizes and people of all ages easily getting to Delicate Arch. Please don't just go look at the viewpoint from the car below. If you do... I hope it's a good reason - because I'm sure there's a few. But mostly anyone can hike to delicate. You get what Moab offers in a short hike. You go over trail, then slick rock, around a few breathtaking views - and then your there - Delicate Arch. You can go right up to it - take that picture and have a blast. Lastly, for ME? - I love to hike. I love to get in it. Devils Garden is amazing. Not to just landscape arch. Not to just the Double O arch - the whole trail around. Takes a few hours but no one does the whole trail and so you can get really caught up in the quiet and the breathtaking views and just slowly take your time walking in sand washes, through rock - and kind of forget that there's people around. They all stopped and went back already. And if you are a true seeker - make sure you book early for a guide - but Fiery Furnace is the cherry on top. Have to with a guide - and it books two weeks in advance ... Arches is amazing. Take your kids! Take your significant other - but sadly, Pets can't go out trails. :)","May 24, 2016",If you haven't been here... GO right now.,10,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

Arches National Park,"We went during some unseasonably warm weather and it was beautiful. Every second of our hike was breathtaking. The entire park is absolutely beautiful. Just make sure you look for cairns or you WILL get lost (we strayed a few times on accident). Just give yourself enough time to get around before dark and pay attention to where you are going and it will be difficult for you not to enjoy every second of your trip here, no mater what you are doing. Stargazing is the best we have ever seen, especially when coming from a place like Chicago! DEFINITELY worth the trip. ","May 24, 2016",Best Place on Earth,2,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Arches National Park,"Arches National Park is one of the most accessible and amazing national parks in Utah. It pales in size compared to Canyonlands, but the accessible, in your face geological formations are unlike any others you will find anywhere in the United States. To be sure, there are sandstone arches in other locations, but nowhere is there such a concentration of arches within a few hundred square miles. This is a must visit national park when traveling through Utah. Camping is very limited inside Arches, so plan and reserve early. If you miss the park campground, there are plenty of camping and lodging opportunities in and around Moab. Moab is the typical staging point for most people visiting Arches. We like to stay at the La Quinta in Moab. So, how do you get to Moab? From Colorado come in on I-70 and turn left on 191 South to Moab. A more interesting side trip past the Fisher Towers and following the Colorado River is made by turning South on 128 about 20 miles after you cross the Utah border. You will be wondering what you got yourself into for the first few miles because the terrain is desolate. But trust me, it gets better and better as the miles go by and when you get to the river, you’ll be glad you came this way, especially if you’ve ever taken the I-70 route before. Coming from Arizona to the south you want to come up 163 East until you reach 191 North and again you end up in Moab. So you made it Moab. If you are bicycle tourists, you will like Moab because there is a bike path all the way to the park. The park is small, so you can ride almost every road in a day, without sightseeing stops. Arches National Park is a few minutes North of Moab by car. The visitor’s center is just a few yards past the entrance gate. This is an excellent place to fill up all your water bottles. There is no other place to get water once you are inside the park, except at Devils Garden. TRAVEL ALERT: There is a ranger led hike in the park in the Fiery Furnace. You must reserve in advance. You must check in at the Visitor’s center. Getting a tour spot on the same day as the hike is unheard of. You can check and if you are lucky……………well, I am unlucky. If you are like me, as soon as you decide to go to Arches, go to the Arches website and drill down to activities. There will be information on how to make your reservations for the Fiery Furnace Ranger led hike. Read the overview and know the rules. BOOK IN ADVANCE or you won’t get to do the hike. You will be happy if you do the hike. You cannot go into the Fiery Furnace without a Ranger. END OF ALERT. The visitor’s center is very educational and a fun place to visit. You can easily spend an hour just in there. Spend some time and learn how these fantastic geological wonders were created. Since you will be spending at least a couple of days here, (I recommend three if you are in to landscape photography with a tripod), you can start out with a simple driving tour, stopping at all the pullouts along the way. About 10 mile in there is a turn to the right that takes you out to the Windows Section. Another 2.5 miles along the main road you come to the right turn out to Delicate Arch. 9 more miles along the main road brings you to the Devils Garden. That is pretty much it for all the paved roads in the park. The rest of the roads are for the off road adventurists and that isn’t me. So, after driving all the paved roads in the park and stopping at every turn off, you have done what most visitors do at Arches. But now the adventures can begin. It is probably still early in the day so head back to Moab to have an early dinner and maybe sight see a little downtown. Then you want to drive back into the park to the Delicate Arch parking lot. You are going to hike to Delicate arch to watch the sun set and the stars come out. You want to start walking at least an hour and a half before sunset. After sunset you will walk back in the dark. Wear sturdy hiking shoes and bring headlamps or flashlights. You will be up there with at least a couple hundred of your newest best friends, so you won’t be alone. Sunset at Delicate Arch is amazing. Depending on the clouds, the lighting on the La Sal Mountains, the nearby mesas and buttes and Delicate Arch will present photo opportunities that will make you look like a professional photographer. After dark, the walk down under the stars is beautiful. And look at the shrubs as you walk. Those glowing points of light you see are the eyes of tiny spiders that live in all the bushes. It is so cool. When you get back to town and you can go to one of the many restaurants or ice cream parlors for an after hike treat before going to bed. Get up early in the morning, have a nice breakfast and head back up to the park. As you drive in on the main road, stop at Park Avenue. There is a trail that goes about a mile down the valley to the road and the Courthouse Towers Viewpoint. We like to drop the hikers in our group off at the top of Park Avenue and then drive down to the bottom of the trail and wait for them. Or you can hike from the top or the bottom and do an out and double back. You will probably want to stop at all the viewpoints along the road again because you have different light early in the morning and the colors are spectacular. The next must stop point is the Balanced Rock. You must stop here and take the quarter mile hike around this unusual monolith. It amazes me that it has not fallen after all these millennia. After Balanced Rock, drive up to the road, turn right and drive out to the Windows Section. The two must do hikes are out around the Windows and Turret Arch and then out to Double Arch. All the trails add up to less than two miles and they are very easy to do. If you were lucky enough to get on the tour, it may be time to head to the Fiery Furnace ranger led walk. You will go out into the fins and get totally lost, Don’t worry, The ranger knows the way. You will see arches that few others get to see. You will get to step over deep crevasses and walk through narrow slot canyons. It is a blast. It may seem or sound intimidating, but it is doable by virtually every one who can hike. In a couple of hours you are back to your car, one of the lucky few in the park that day, and ready for more adventures. Now you can head out to Devils Garden and explore the trails to Skyline Arch and the always amazing Landscape Arch with its huge span. There are many more arches in this area and trails to take you to them. You may have been able to get all the major arches under your belt by now. But I suggest that you hang around, have a picnic and watch the sunset from your favorite location. The next morning you want to come out before sunrise so you can experience the spiritual moment of sunrise in the desert and the first light on the sandstone. My favorite places for doing sunrise are out by the Petrified Dunes, although you will probably have found your own spot for your personal experience with nature. Bring a long lens and binoculars. I like night photography with light painting and shooting the Milky Way. Now that you have seen the main features of the park during the day, if you have a camera and tripod and a good flashlight, you may want to get back out with the other 20 or 30 people who like night photography and explore the park. You are virtually alone, after the sun has gone down and the stars are out. This is when I really like to be out in Arches National Park. So I hope this gives you an overview of the park and a little of what to expect. My suggestion is to start early and beat the crowds. If you do a casual start you will be waiting in line at the gate for a long time and parking at the pullouts may be at a premium. If you are there for sunset you may look around and wonder where everyone went. And if the stars are out, you are all by yourself. This is truly an amazing place and you have to break the mold and start early and stay late. You will be happy you did.

Arches National Park,We did the long hike at the very top of the park with all the arches. If you do all the little hikes out to the arches (which are all totally worth it and pretty short) it is just over eight miles I believe. It was such a great hike! My whole group really enjoyed all the aspects of this hike and would definitely be back to experience it again! Notes: it is long and in the desert so pack enough water! There are no restrooms or water areas along the way so make necessary arrangements at the trail head. We also noticed many people hiked to the last arch them went back and hiked up a ways from the other side. This makes it longer actually. If you want to see both sides just do the loop. There is one small section of scrambling over slick rock I this hike so please be aware it is difficult at one section. This is on the very back side of the loop. I have also hiked both of the Delicate arch hikes and really enjoyed them both. The one that takes you out to the arch itself is pretty easy and totally worth the several mile hike. The shorter version where you hike to a vantage point across the way from the arch is fast and fairly easy. It is short (only 1/2 mile round trip) but is a small ascent up stair-like rocks. All the other arches can be seen from the roadway but are still fun to walk up to. ,"May 23, 2016",This is what we came for! ,9,"Hurricane, Utah",5

Arches National Park,"This was my second visit. I checked out two aspects I missed the first visit.1. The passes for the Fiery Furnace ranger walk were 100% sold out on line weeks in advance. We asked at the visitor center on Tuesday and reserved a Friday afternoon tour. That ranger-led tour was well done and a trip highlight. There were 25 on the tour. The late afternoon hike fills last and will get some shade. I recommend asking about the tour and available tickets at the visitor's center. Cost is $16 each.2. On the north end of the park, there is a dirt road that heads northwest to an arch about seven miles off the pavement. If you want to get away from crowds at Arches, take this road. There is a bathroom at the parking lot but bring water. The road surface was OK for 2WD passenger cars. The Park Service did a nice job maintaining it and were adding gravel while we were there.The park accommodates all visitors: some people drive from overlook to overlook, some take a short walk to the arches, and a few take longer hikes.Delicate Arch is the Arches hike because this arch is the iconic park image. It has a large parking lot and a steady stream of people hiking up. It's three miles round trip with 500 feet of elevation. Don't underestimate the fact there is no shade.We visited twice on a Tuesday and a Friday. Tuesday morning's line into the park entrance took 15 minutes.

It was a peaceful hike filled with so many stunning things to look at while hiking. Some of the trails have steep climbs or drop offs.

I don't think I would recommend a trip at night, so make sure you allow an hour and a half to walk to the arch and some time to enjoy the beauty of the view once you get there!","May 20, 2016",Well Worth the Trek!,52,"San Antonio, Texas",5

The park is relatively small, therefore parking at the most popular ""viewpoints"" along the paved park road can be a challenge. Be patient, as folks don't stay at each viewpoint very long and spaces will free-up. The hike to Delicate Arch took us 90 minutes each way and it was steep in places, but very doable.

During clear skies you can see everything. If you have time i highly recommend returning at night with a tripod and DSLR. For a Wednesday there were quite a few people in the park so we encountered short lines at the various restrooms.Bring your camera and expect to exhibit some patience while you wait for other travelers to take theirs first.Buy a national parks pass for $80/yr and return often.

Arches National Park,"We visited the park over a few days. It was recommended to us to start the day early, so we arrived by 8 am, and were able to do several hikes by mid day. We're not expert hikers, and found the easy trails to be perfect for us, and gave great views of the arches and other rock formations. Absolutely stunning! Starting earlier gave us much less traffic and quiet on the trails. At times we were the only ones there, which made it a peaceful way to start the day. The road back to Delicate arch was closed due to flooding our first day there, but we came back the next afternoon and were able to take the shorter hike to see it from a distance. Our last day we started early again and did the Wall Street hike. It was rated as moderate. We started on the courthouse side and hiked back up to Wall Street and back, which worked well and let us have the more strenuous portion toward the middle of the hike.

Recommend hike to Delicate Arch-takes about 1.5 hours roundtrip for a the fit hiker, not a hike for the faint at heart both from a ledge and ascending perspective-really need to be reasonably healthy; trail needs close supervision for those hiking with children. Bring water and wear good hiking shoes or gym shoes with decent traction for some of the smooth parts of the surfaces of rock; Clean/well maintained private outhouse facilities throughout park except for flush restrooms at Visitor center.

Three hours later after our first hike cars were circling the lot waiting for someone to leave. The hike to arches is up hill. Look for the small rock piles marking the trail.

Arches National Park,"Arches is a fascinating and beautiful national park that if you are anywhere near Moab you really should take the time to tour. There are countless hikes, of varying difficulty, that invariably take you to a spectacular arch or other rock formation. The hike to the Delicate Arch, while not particularly long (around 3 miles round trip) can be a little difficult for those not in shape, as it's uphill all the way, and there is a rock ledge that makes some people uncomfortable. However, it's well worth the effort. There are other easier, hikes to differing arches that are also impressive. The Windows and the Double Arch are two that are easier to get to and also quite beautiful. The part itself isn't that big, and if you have 3 days, you could probably hike every trail it has. For those not interested in hiking, you can see a lot from the main road as well.

Well we had just come from CNP and told him so. We got a permit out of him but he sounded like a broken record, because everything else we wanted to do he would repeat ""Well, you can, but it's not recommended.""

Arches National Park,"Arches National Park is a quick 5 mile drive from the town of Moab. The front gate will charge $25.00 per vehicle for a 7 day park pass, good for all of the parks. Very reasonable, and well worth the cost. The gate leads to a paved road that winds 18 miles through some of the most beautiful scenery in the world. Even if you never got out of the vehicle, the drive is well worth the visit! It showcases some of the arches, rock formations, fins, and spires. Truly spectacular. There are plenty of parking sports at each of the attractions, and even though most are occupied, it never takes long to wait for one to open up. There are picnic spots, and short walks to viewpoints, I even saw a couple of wheelchairs. My point is, you don't have to be a big adventure seeker to get around here. One person in our group had a broken arm and difficulty walking. She enjoyed it as much as the rest of us!For shorter hikes, I suggest the Windows area. Well manicured paths lead to spectacular arches that children are able to climb right up to. The Courthouse area, Fiery Furnace Lookout, Delicate Arch lookout, and the beginning of the Devils Garden area, also have great shorter hikes.If you are looking for something more challenging, the Devils Garden Primitive loop is a must do! It's approximately 8 miles, and climbs 1200ft. It's rugged and difficult in spots, getting up onto some of the rocks and fins, but well worth the effort. The trail is marked by a series of cairns, and at times are small and difficult to see. We got lost once, as did the couple in front of us. Just be alert!We also took our 75 year old father up to Delicate Arch, 3 miles, 500ft elevation. Totally doable for most, just take your time.I recommend going early in the morning. We got to the park before 8am every day, and had no difficulty parking at the trail heads. Take plenty of water!! I can't stress that enough! There is no where to get water on the trails! Take food, again, no where to buy food once in the park. Wear sunscreen and a hat.

Delicate Arch was my favorite but be prepared for a hike that is about 45 minutes long in each direction. You will be walking on a ledge on the side of a cliff for the last leg of the hike. Not many flat area's once you reach the arch. If you are afraid of heights - this is not the hike for you. The hike is mostly uphill but well worth the hike to see this Arch - it truly is amazing to see in person. Pictures cannot describe it.

Arches National Park,"We were fortunate to have a sunny day during our visit to Arches National Park. Be aware that it is quite ""touristy"" so there will be plenty of visitors while you are there. Apparently many people come in early in the morning or later in the evening to take pictures during sunrise or sunset. We did not do that but did take a number of hikes. In fact, a visit to the Landscape Arch requires a 1.6 mile roundtrip hike. The trail is considered ""easy"" but does have some up and down grades. There is a strenuous trail (with a 480 foot change in elevation) to Delicate Arch but we took a moderate trail with about 200 feet elevation to another overlook that still gave good views of the arch, especially since my camera had a zoom lens.The Double Arch was packed with tourists and tour buses/RVs so the hardest thing was finding a place to park.

Arches National Park,"Arches National Park is overwhelming with the diversity of topography and geology. There can be long lines to enter the park, so go early and plan the full day to be there. We missed the Visitor Center due to our early arrival and late departure. There are many trails classified from easy to strenuous. We hiked the Fiery Furnace (with Charley from Deep Desert Expeditions, separate review for this hike), Devil's Garden Trail, and the Windows Section. The road to Delicate Arch had been closed. Fiery Furnace has to be hiked with a park ranger or guide company that has obtained a day permit. The hike is strenuous in scrambling over rocks and slipping through narrow canyons. The hike does give views and experiences not seen from a car or observation point. My husband & I are in our 60s and general good health. We enjoyed the hike and accomplishment. Devil's Garden Trailhead has a good variety of trails to hike and arches to view. We hiked to Landscape Arch, which is a good example of the erosion of arches. The arch dropped a good chunk of rock in the 1990s. The Windows is great for easy hiking and seeing many arches. We saw Double Arch, North and South Window, Turret, and Parade of Elephants. While standing near the Window arches, we counted 8 different arches. Cool! Our final stop was at the Courthouse Towers Viewpoint. This structure is massive and majestic.

Arches National Park,"This is a spectacular, don’t-miss national park filled with awe-inspiring rock formations. If you are an outdoor photographer, rock scrambler or simply a fan of the red-rock topography there is simply no better place. I recently spent 2 days there and believe this is sufficient to fully experience everything it has to offer. On Day 1, I spent the morning driving through the park, stopping at all the scenic overlooks and pull-outs and doing some of the short hikes/walks such as the Windows Section. It was very foggy so some of the views were obscured but it also offered a different perspective. I spent the afternoon hiking the Devils Garden full loop and rock scrambling in that area. The trail can get crowded but there are plenty of sidetrails where you can feel completely alone. On Day 2, I hiked out to Delicate Arch shortly after sunrise and then spent 2 hours in the Fiery Furnace (permit required). I finished with the Park Avenue hike and left the park and headed towards Canyonlands. Tips: Go early in the morning and avoid the crowds and warmer weather. Delicate Arch is best done near sunrise for the best photos and fewest people. It’s a must do. Devil’s Garden gets crowded so go early. Since it’s at the end of the park, drive there first and work your way back through the park. Eat at the Moab Brewery – great place for pub food and a cold beverage after a day of physical exertion.

We recommend arriving at the park early (it opens around 7 am). When we were there last week, we arrived early and hiked to Delicate Arch. When we drove out of the park at mid-day, the line to get into the park on this Saturday was almost out to the highway. The parking lot at Delicate Arch was full to by mid-morning.

Hike to the Delicate Arch was a gradual climb over rocks but imagine in the summer the rocks would be miserably hot.

From the west it's 191 and from east it's 128.Neither my book on national parks or GPS told me to take 128 out even though our trip was Eastbound on I70. It is a little curvy and we were in a camper van ,but WELL WORTH IT!!! It was like driving in a miniature Grand Canyon. I wouldn't recommend this pulling a trailer or driving big RV. So, back the the Arches. It's great. We did this in half a day. I wish I had longer. So many easy hikes (which we did at 56 and 64) and then more strenuous if that's what you are looking for. The rocks and arches are amazing! We stopped at stops on our right going in (BalanceD Rock - easiest hike), The Windows Area (2nd), Delicate Arch (a little more taxing if you go to upper viewing. We didn't do 3 mile hike), Double Arch then last Landscape Arch which is the biggest at 306 feet. Go all the way to the end past the campground.

Arches is my favorite park in UT so I had to make sure he got to see a bit of it. We took a nice hike around Balancing Rock and enjoyed the cool air on the shady side. After that brief foray we drove to the parking area for Delicate Arch. Although the lot was not full there will still probably more than a hundred people milling around and on the trail, even at 4:00 in the afternoon. Our hike to Delicate Arch was uneventful but enjoyable. I always like to watch visitor’s faces as they round the last corner in the trail and see Delicate Arch up close. Almost everyone is in awe. There were no less than 50 people at the arch and it was impossible to get a photo without someone else in the picture. Most people were respectful but there were a few that were not, such as the person that spilled a whole package of crackers and left them there.As mentioned, Arches National Park is my favorite NP in Utah. However, I prefer to go there in March or October. The crowds are smaller. February is great, too, but it can be cold then.

Arches National Park,"Yes, it's worth the $25 admission --- the park service has to maintain this large park / its roads / its trails / staffing. I recommend that you consider paying the $80 for a full year of any National Park, National Monument, Historic Monument / and sometimes it covers other parks as well. Arches ---- you need to allow a minimum of 2 days if you want to do/see most of what's there. Many hikes so this is not extremely accessible, but if you're into hiking, taking photos --- it's a wonderland. Amazing array of geology and scenery (La Sal Mtns a backdrop). We visited on 2 different days so we could cover the activities on our list (and this was not our first time here). We strongly recommend for first-timers, when you get to the visitor center --- make sure that you go to the Rangers Info Desk first and talk to them about your interests and your capabilities. *The hike to Delicate Arch is strenuous. And it is also a very busy trail. You may want to do it very early or late afternoon, when the crowds start to thin. No rush to get out of the park ----- it's open 24 hrs a day!Timing: try to visit on a weekday to avoid some of the crowds, and have patience in the park -- some of the parking lots may be full, but if you wait / or circle a bit, someone is usually leaving.

There's plenty of room to walk on the way up until you get to that cliff and having 2 way traffic, with little kids running around and people (like me) afraid of heights, it was tense! Once you get to the arch, it's tough to get a picture of it without a stranger in the photo -- advice is to go early. And, then come back after the park closes and do some star-gazing.

Delicate Arch, though challenging, is one of those hikes you cannot miss. We would definitely do this one a little earlier in the trip (for our tired feet) but otherwise it was perfect. Skip the short viewpoint trail and go for the real deal...Climbing over giant rocks was awesome for our kiddo and there's something about red rocks against a clear blue desert sky that can't be adequately put into words. The park does a great job of breaking down the hikes into easy, moderate and strenuous so you can plan your visit. They even give suggestions on best spots to photograph at sunrise and sunset. Bring water and lots of snacks - you'll work up an appetite!","April 25, 2016",Simply Spectacular,8,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",5
Arches National Park,"Really, how could you give the place less than 5 stars? Arches NP is wonderful, even better than I had hoped. Lots of really cool stuff is accessible via a short walk from your car, but there are lots of great arches and sights for those willing to hike a bit. ","April 25, 2016",6 stars,65,Minneapolis,5
Arches National Park,"Arches National Park is amazing. It's hard to describe because there is so much to see. It's a different style hiking if you're not from around this area because its all on sand and slickrock type surfaces. It is well worth the time to spend here. I've been twice and would come back. Must do Delicate Arch if you're coming. It is a 1.5 mile trail to the Arch, plus 1.5 miles back, for a total 3 miles round trip. Fairly steep section walking up the slickrock. All internet sites and even the sign at the trail head say that it is best photographed in the evening or near sunset versus early morning. Either way it is amazing.","April 25, 2016",April 2016,49,,5
Arches National Park,"I've wanted to go Arches for a while and finally had the opportunity. The area gets extremely hot so plan accordingly. The park has a number of arches (hence the name) and you do need to drive from parking lot to parking lot to see the different attractions. Go early as the park closed every day while we were there due to over crowding. Most of the hikes are simple and young kids would not have an issue. Be mindful of which hikes you are doing as the rare few of them can be quite intense, with steep sides to climb up and down (double O arch). Majority of the arches can been seen with a relatively short hike.If you have the opportunity to obtain a permit to play in the devils playground, do it! That was the best part of the trip! We had a tour guide with us but you are able to do it on your own if you get the permit. Within the area is such a unique landscape compared to the rest of the park where we had fun climbing over and under rocks, into crevices and on top of arches. The area is delicate which is why they require permits to enter. Please be respectful of where you stand when you go. Also, for those with bad knees, you might want to carefully consider going as there is a bit of climbing up and down (though nothing too intense).","April 25, 2016",Nature at its best,129,"Chicago, Illinois",5

Arches National Park,"I was at the Arches on a small group tour so where I went was at the discretion of my guide. She dropped me off at one end of Park Avenue and picked me up at the other end. To my amazement, I was the only one on this walk until my guide met me towards the end. The formations here were beautiful and we saw a mule deer with twins. We then went to the North and South Window Arches and Double Arches which was unfortunately crowded with bus tours but you could find solitude if you walked around behind South Window. The walk to Delicate Arch is not for the faint hearted, especially if it is hot but it is a popular walk with people vying for a photo in front of the arch, but you have to do it!!

Arches National Park,"We decided to do the hike to Delicate Arch as the panel at the trail head made it look quite easy. We had just done a hike at the Grand Canyon a few days prior so we figured this would be a piece of cake. Be warned, this is a moderately strenuous hike, so wear proper footwear, take some water and be in decent physical shape. We were just fine, but we saw many people who looked like they'd have a hard time walking across the Wal-Mart parking lot attempting this. The hike is worth it, the view is awesome at the arch, well, maybe not Grand Canyon awesome, but still darn nice.","April 24, 2016",Delicate Arch Hike,7,"Pierz, Minnesota",5
Arches National Park,"My husband and I visited Arches at the very end of Sept 2015. It was still very hot (90's during the day!) at that time of year. Here are some things to know:There is one main road through the park, and it is loooong. It probably took us close to 30 min to drive to Delicate Arch AFTER we entered the park. The road, the pull-offs, the parking lots, and the trails get very crowded during the day. GET THERE EARLY! An added bonus is it won't be so hot, either, if you go early in the morning.Take water in with you. I didn't see any place to get water inside the park except for the visitor's center at the entrance. Once you pass it, you're on your own. Bring more than you think you need if you're going when it's hot.If you have mobility issues, don't skip the park because of that. There is a lot to see from the car. There are also a lot of pull-offs where you can park and take photos. Some arches/rock formations are only a very short walk from a pull-off or parking area, and the walk is level. Do not let lack of mobility stop you from going to Arches! You'll still be able to see and do a lot.If you plan to walk to a lot of the arches, wear sunscreen and a hat. Even if you don't normally wear a hat, you're going to need one if the sun is out. There is VERY little shade in this park. You could also go in the evening when the heat and sun aren't nearly as strong. If you're there at dusk, it's actually quite pleasant. When we were there in Sept, it was hot as blazes during the day, but when we returned in the evening, it was lovely. Not as crowded, not hot at all, and the arches looked beautiful in the setting sun.Highly recommend!!","April 24, 2016","Huge park with lots of great hikes, but you can see a lot from the car, too!",163,"Hickory, North Carolina",5

This is a 5* trail taking you among and through so many wonderful rock formations and peaks at small arches as we got to Landscape Arch, an old and very large arch that is beginning to crack and will collapse soon. There were huge crowds of people on this 2 hour easy trail and it was quite a warm day - take water! We did a quick stop at Fiery Furnace (not colorful since it wasn't sundown) and a short hike to delicate Arch viewpoint to see the most famous arch of all. It was a big day, but we loved it. The next morning we got an early start back to Arches NP to beat the heavy crowds and had a great easy hike on the Windows Trail with great arches - N. Windows, S. Windows, and Turret Arch. All were huge; a great hike. After two other short stops, crowds began coming in full force by 10 AM. In spite of heavy crowds, we loved this park!

From the same viewpoint/parking area, the Sand Dune Arch is a much shorter walk, but through an extremely narrow defile & over sand. Sand Dune Arch is particularly spectacular with exceptional geological interest as well. The ""lower"" viewpoint for Delicate Arch offers a better - though very distant - view of Delicate Arch, and is a very easy walk from the parking lot. The upper viewpoint for Delicate Arch is extremely difficult for those with mobility issues, and a fairly strenuous workout for hikers.

Arches National Park,"As the name implies, there are natural sandstone arches created by water flowing through sandstone when this area of land was underwater. The history of the area can best be learned by renting a flash drive for a self guided automobile tour covering the 18 miles of paved roadway taking you into the area. You pay a $20 deposit to rent the flash drive at the gift shop at the entrance and headquarters of the park. When you return the flash drive, you get $15 refunded to you.If you're planning on doing any hiking, fill your water bottles from the two water faucets near the gift shop entrance facing the parking lot. There is no other water available once you continue driving into the National park. When you see signs recommending that you carry a certain amount of water with you, take that advice seriously.  We hiked up to ""Delicate Arch"" carrying only one bottle of water each. That water was used up by the time we reached the Arch far above the starting point because it was a hot sunny day. The only people who didn't seem to be bothered by the lack of water were the younger hikers. For old people like us, your body temperature isn't as well controlled. You will lose water by sweating. I would recommend an early start for hiking before the Sun becomes blazing hot. Use Sun screen or you will burn. I would also recommend wearing a light weight wide brim hat. A hiking stick helps steady you on uneven ground. Of course, the younger hikers don't seem to have a problem walking without a stick or carrying water. We were all there once so long ago.

Parking lots at the trailheads fill up between around 9am and 2pm. Go on the more popular hikes early to have a less crowded experience.

If you do have some time I would recommend doing the hikes during spring and fall when the temperatures are cooler, or during the golden hours just after sunrise or and before sunset. Delicate Arch hike is a short 3.2mi round trip but it can be somehow moderate due to some of the steep grades.

The view are amazing, as is most of Utah!When you get to the arch itself, its a great place to rest and take photos of course. Just remember, when the trail guide says its strenuous, it is. This has not been dumbed down like we have done for clothing sizes! A large is a large, so to speak. I saw some people on this walk that did not look like they could make it. But they did, just took twice as long. But do be careful. There are a couple of spots where a wrong move will actually kill you. There are no guardrails.","April 18, 2016","A lot of walking, and a lot of scenery",20,"Wilton, Connecticut",4

Please remember: this place is run by the government and no returns on what you purchased are excepted. They expect you donate your tickets back to NP and will be proud of it. Another good all day hike is Devils Gardens. Allow for 4-6 hr to make the full circle. Primitive loop section is very difficult and somewhat dangerous. Hiking boots are a must there.

Arches National Park,"The short story: Arches National Park is a ""Life List"" destination that rewards drive-through visitors as well as hikers with scenery that will knock your eyes out---and Canyonlands National Park is just a few hours away.We visited Arches National Park with limited time and so, could not fully explore its many trails. What we were able to see was awe-inspiring! We took one longer day hike to Delicate Arch, and just a few short day-hikes to other attractions. We also drove everywhere we could. (If you have difficulty walking, a slow drive through the Park with stops at its scenic viewpoints will prove to be very rewarding---it worked for us!)Every minute we spent in Arches NP offered a feast for the eyes. If you vacation anywhere within the Southern Utah region, missing Arches NP would be a mistake. Bring a camera, extra batteries, and extra memory chips---or, if you still do it ""old-school,"" bring plenty of film.If you happen to catch Arches NP just after a bit of early-morning rain (as we did), you will be astonished at the rainwater's effects on the colors of the rocks.The Park is just a few miles from Moab, Utah, which offers plenty of opportunity for good food and drink, and comfortable lodging---and hot-air balloon rides, and Hummer tours of the back-country. We did both, and really enjoyed them. The hot-air balloon ride was very entertaining, informative, and relaxing, and very quiet. The Hummer tour was a ""sunset tour,"" and I recommend you do it if you decide on a Hummer tour. (If you have the time, Canyonlands National Park is just a few hours from Moab.

Arches National Park,"Arches National Park is now one of my favorite parks. My experiences here far exceeded my expectations. There are fun hiking trails, breathtaking views, and gorgeous scenery all around the park. I did the Devils Garden hike to Dark Angel and then hiked back to the trailhead (I decided against going through the Primitave Trail). This particular trail was neat because of the diversity of the terrain. At one point, I was walking atop huge boulders that allowed me to see a lot of the park from a unique perspective. There were also parts of the trail that were clearly marked and paved. Make sure to follow the cairns when you're not sure where to go! I saw several arches on this trail. Landscape Arch and Partition Arch were my personal favorites of this trail.Now, the best part of the park is definitely hiking to and seeing Delicate Arch. I've seen so many pictures, advertisements, and works of art that featured this famous structure. However, seeing it and admiring it in person is nothing like what I've seen in pictures. I loved this Arch and trail so much that I hiked it again the following evening, just to catch the sunset on Delicate Arch. It was well worth it.

Bring enough water and stop for rest as often needed. Try your best to make it to the top as it is breathtaking.

I could only spend 1 day in the park and was concerned about crowds, so I got through the entrance gate at 8am (a 5 minute drive from the Motel 6, Moab.) I went straight to Devils Garden trail and did the full hike which included the primitive trail portion. My trip was mid-week the first full week of April. There were only a few cars at the trailhead, although when I finished the hike around 3pm, the parking area was near full, although spots were still available. The hike was spectacular, although be prepared for scrambling over fins, walking up steep rock faces, and sudden drop-offs if you attempt the primitive section. Sturdy shoes and comfort with heights are strongly recommended! I strongly recommend going slightly off trail where appropriate (on rock or previously traveled surfaces - do NOT travel over the cryptobiotic soils or walk on any plants or across any of the arches). These lead to amazing views with little extra effort - take your time with this hike and take all of the side trails - soak it all in! The primitive section was peaceful, but I frequently encountered other hikers on the trail. The main trail was much busier. After I finished Devils Garden, I visited many of the other overlooks and short hikes in the park - again, busy areas, but I never had a problem finding parking. The weather was perfect for hiking - mid-60's and sunny. ","April 8, 2016",Amazing Day in Arches!,16,"Chester, New Jersey, United States",5

Arches National Park,"I spent 4 days in Moab, and used 3 of them at Arches (1 at Canyonlands). The entire park is amazing, but my best recommendations:- Delicate Arch is a must-do, but a tough hike. Go early otherwise your photos will have 1000 people in them. Or go at night, but be wary of getting there in the dark.- Double Arch is my favorite. Really cool and no hiking required.- Landscape Arch is worth the hike, but go earlier vs later because the setting sun makes it hard to photograph.- Park Avenue is a great walk. Especially close to sunset when the light is perfection.- La Sal Mountain viewpoint is the best in the park. Perfect view of the Three Gossips and surrounding area.","April 6, 2016",Absolutely my favorite national park in Utah!,130,"Kansas City, Missouri",5

Arches National Park,"We visited Arches a couple times during our stay in Moab. The first trip we went in on a cold rainy day so not many people out and about. Most toured by car since it was snowing up at the higher elevations. Plenty to see along the main roads. The second trip we went in about 10:00 a.m. Traffic was backed up all the way to the highway (over a half-mile) and it took better than 15 minutes to get to the station. It would be nice if there was an express lane for people who already had their pass and maps...I'm going to sound off on one thing that really irritated me...As you're enjoying the natural beauty of the arch and notice people taking pictures of that natural beauty, ask yourself, will it enhance everyone else's photo if I'm standing in it? There were literally dozens of people standing in line to take a turn getting a selfie under the arch...it was like a photo booth at Disney World. OK end of rant.Take some time, get off the road and enjoy the beauty of God's creation!I like Arches because it's pretty much just beautiful desert.

Arches National Park,"Take your toddler and young children to Sand Dune Arch (no hiking involved, just a teeny short walk) and take snacks, because they will want to spend hours exploring the deep sandy path and the narrow slot (that does not have a nasty fall at the far end of it). Intrepid hikers can do Devil's Garden Loop, which takes you across a narrow fin (don't look down!) and a super-slopy slab (if it rains, stop and wait, don't continue!) during a beautiful loop trail that includes Double O Arch, Dark Angel (rock formation), and a few side trails to additional arches (Private Arch is especially cool - surprise!). Tip: The left trail takes you across the fin; the right trail takes you to the slopy slab, you have to do one of them to get to Double O. If I were doing it again, I'd take the fin. Even though it looks deadly (and it would be if you fell) it is safe unless you do something crazy (like a Warrior 3 pose along it, for instance). I hope never to do the slopy slab again, although I'm super glad I experienced the hike - it is beautiful and a fun adventure.","April 3, 2016",Beauty and fun for the toddler and the death-defying hiker :-),59,"Boulder, CO",5

Arches National Park,"We travelled to Moab in March to visit Arches and Canyonlands National Parks. Arches appeared to be far more crowded than Canyonlands as we waited 45 minutes in traffic to enter the park. Once in the park traffic moved fairly well but be advised that parking near some key attractions is limited and can be filled when you arrive there. Best advice, move on to the next attraction. You will be able to see all that you want but you need to be flexible. We experienced people waiting in their cars for other visitors to leave so that they could take that parking spot. It's disrespectful to hold up traffic in this way. There are many other areas to see, just keep moving and hit the sites missed on your way out. Many of the Arches require walking. Some walks can be short, maybe .2 mile and others can be up to 7 miles. Remember that you are at a higher elevation and that water is a MUST. Lots of water. Drink, drink drink! Some of the walks are no grade and others have many ups and downs. The mid afternoon sun can make your walk a little more challenging. Be prepared by paying attention to weather forecasts. High winds can make your walk additionally challenging. Leave your flip flops for the beach vacation and wear sturdy comfortable shoes. Carry a light backpack with water and snacks and layers of clothing depending on the weather.

On a Saturday in mid-March, there was a 15-minute wait to enter the park, and in the late afternoon the parking lot at the trailhead for Delicate Arch was full. Delicate Arch was my least favorite sight; there were just too many people there. The loop hike in the ""Devil's garden"" section (to the Double O and then the Dark Angel, and back by the ""primitive"" trail) is very easy (more a walk than a hike), except for a short stretch on a smooth sloping rock face, which takes a bit of care to negotiate. (Presumably that short section is the reason the trail is rated ""difficult"" by the Park Service.)","March 29, 2016",Great scenery,20,"Toronto, Canada",4

Arches National Park,"In the Canyonlands v Arches debate, I lean towards Canyonlands, but can understand why many prefer Arches. Arches is smaller, more manageable, and can be visited in a day. The Devil's Garden hike was nice, but Delicate Arch, the Windows area, and Courthouse Towers area were stunning. On a 3-day weekend trip, I was smart enough to visit Arches on the Friday and Canyonlands on Sat/Sun. Arches gets crowded with long lines on cars lining up to get in, even mid-March.","March 29, 2016",Not to be missed.,42,NY,5

Arches National Park,If you are in decent walking shape or have a good attitude you should definitely do the Delicate Arch hike.

Arches National Park,"My 10 year old daughter learned about Delicate Arch during summer camp, so we planned a family vacation to visit it. My wife, 11-year old daughter and I accompanied our younger daughter on this trip.We camped at the Green River State Park the night before our visit (see my other review). Starting less than an hour away, we were able to get to Arches no later than 9:30 without rushing.Things we did well:1. Got there early. The stay at Green River State Park helped. We didn't get there for sunrise, but were early enough.2. Checked out the Visitors' Center to get our bearings (we did not visit the gift shop prior to the rest of our visit).3. Took a quick look at Balanced Rock on the way in.4. Got to Delicate Arch parking lot early. There were lots of spaces at 10 am.5. Did the Delicate Arch hike with lots of water and snacks. Our kids did this hike with no problem; don't be scared away. (There were several families with little kids, even infants. Unless you are able to carry your kid uphill for 90 minutes and trust your child to run around on a trail with cliffs I would not recommend bringing children younger than 5.)6. We hung out at Delicate Arch for an hour or so, taking pictures, resting and eating a snack.7. We took pictures on the way out. Panorama Point is especially beautiful.8. We stopped at the Visitors' Center gift shop on the way out.We accomplished all of the above in 4 /2 hours. Things we did not do well:A. We didn't take the drive into The Windows Section to see North and South Window and Double Arch.B. We didn't see any of the arches at the north end of the park.C. We slipped on the sand going downhill. Be careful of sand on the stones!I guess we will have to visit again!Arches National Park is definitely worth the drive.","March 28, 2016",Extremely Memorable Family Memory,274,"New York City, New York",5

We sat for awhile and watched the arch just stand and change colors as people take turns in photographing it. It was relaxing in that area. Crowds do thicken past 10am.

Arches National Park,"In my opinion this is one of the best National Parks. You really feel like you're on another planet. Having visited the park previously, we only went to see Delicate Arch this time. There are two options: am easy, short walk to view the arch Fri afar and a hike of about 45 to 60 minutes to get there and the same time to head back. I recommend the longer walk if you are able to walk 2 or 3 miles as you can then appreciate the arch from more different angles and be in awe of its scale. However, there's more to it than just one Arch. On our last visit we hiked to Double-O Arch which was a very enjoyable experience. Also make sure you stop for a few pictures of the La Sal Mountains, which looked spectacular at sunset. One thing I regret was not getting a few photos as we entered the park (about 90 minutes before sunset. At this time the rocks on the first few miles of the park road looked amazing.

Wet would be a disaster, but it was a clear day and days since any rain. The road beyond the park boundary was sandy in a few places where we briefly hit bottom, but no problems. There were other places with some deep ruts in hardened baked clay soil. These were also OK in all places except one that was a bit dicey for about 50 feet.

Enjoyed all the hikes and even the drives through the park are so peaceful and calm. Not as crowded as other parks, I believe due to its remoteness in Moab. We visited these areas: Las Sal Mountains Viewpoint, Courthouse Wash, Double Arch (amazing!), Garden of Eden, Sand Dune Arch, Park Avenue (afternoon light), Windows (both day and for night photography), and Delicate Arch viewpoint (lower).

If going to Delicate Arch, I recommend starting from the Wolfe Ranch parking lot and not just doing the view point, you can get much closer.

I would think that people who are able to hike into the back parts of the park would see fantastic views. But people like me, have to be satisfied with what is visible near the road.

A balancing boulder, a rock formation that looks like a giant dinosaur head, huge rock layers that have been flipped into a vertical position, and, of course, many arches. One can both just drive the roads of the park, or get out and walk to the many arches. Caution, walking distances are long ranging from 100 yards to several miles, so come prepared. The park and park roads are open all day (24 hours) as there are places to camp overnight, but the visitor centers closes at 4PM. A drive to the ""end"" of the road (Devil's Campground) takes about 45 minutes depending on how many stops you make and their duration. The return trip is along the same road.

Can see a lot in a day but if you have a few days to explore the different areas in more depth, try to do so.

The only stop we made at this time was to hike a quarter mile up to a vantage-point to look at Delicate Arch that was a half-mile away. It was quite a spectacular view, even from that distance. It wasn’t until you looked through the binoculars that you got a real perspective of the rock formation. With the naked eye, you could not see, but with the binoculars you could just make out the people milling around its base while it towered over them. This is the state symbol on the Utah license plate and any picture of this park, this arch is prominently displayed. You can walk up to and about it but this means parking at a different lot and hiking in a mile and a half up the bluff.The next day (after a big breakfast) we returned to Arches and spent the day hiking, up to and through and around Turret Arch, Landscape Arch, Pine Tree Arch, and the North and South Windows, just to name a few. Spectacular (!), each had its own uniqueness and personality. We also took a park ranger field hike through the desert (Park Avenue) as she pointed out animals and plants and rock formations. That evening we went on another field trip to see picturegraphs. The picturegraphs were on a cliff, and you had to climb 300-400 feet, almost vertically, to get to them. Not a bad climb, but you had better be prepared!! But we were able to get up close and the ranger talked about the history of the art, the people, the area and so on. He then handed out instructions to find more local “rock art.” So we hopped to it and found some more petroglyphs that were right on the side of the local highway. This time the Highway Department erected signs pointing them out and providing a safe place to pull off to the side of the road.That night we took advantage of the clear skies and headed back to the park about 9pm. We stopped along side the main road, got out, and looked up at the stars, which literally blanketed the sky. No light pollution anywhere to spoil the view. The Milky Way was so thick, you couldn’t see any black in it, it was truly solid with stars. Looking through the binoculars just showed star after star after star, deeper and further away, with no end. For city slickers, this is an incredible site.","February 18, 2016",one of the best National Parks . . . ever,163,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5
Arches National Park,"We visited Arches National Park as one of our recent 5 national parks tour. We actually camped at the Devil's Garden Campground situated way within the park for 2 nights.The huge red/orange colored rocks rising above the ground, mostly in big clusters of monuments are breathtakingly beautiful! Truly majestic, we were in awe! One has to see the picturesque scenery in order to appreciate it.  The campground s set in perfect location, within many beautiful rock formations. It is also within easy distance to all the famous arches. If you are not camping, the town of Moab is within 5 miles distance away. It is a very pleasant little town with quite a few restaurants, hotels.Within the national park, be prepared to do at least a little hiking to see some favorite arches. However, there's always a car park near by. Hiking to see the famous Landscape Arch may take around 20 minutes from the nearest car park. Believe me, it is well worth it!We were not able to see the Delicate Arch due to the road leading there been flooded. (this was caused by heavy rain storm brought by the monsoon last Oct) Too bad for us!Don't forget to be up and about the park, even just by driving around, during sunset. The rocks change their color as the sun set at different angles, red, pink, orange etc... Truly amazing!!!We recommend visiting in Sept/Oct as the weather is not too hot or too cold. Days are warm (if not raining), but night can be pretty cold. So bring your warm clothing, jackets.We highly recommend visiting this park, it is truly a national treasure!

Arches National Park,"We absolutely loved our visit to Arches National Park with our 22 year old son and 18 year old daughter. The landscape is spectacular and the sheer scale of the rock formations blew us away. It is a big National Park and there is a lot to do. We wished we'd allowed more time. That being said, it is quite accessible from Moab - 15 minute drive to the entrance- although we did have a queue the first afternoon which was about 30 cars long (I think this was due to President's Day long weekend)There is a good map given to you when you buy your entrance ticket - US $25 for a private car and that gives you a week's entry!We visited many different areas including the Gossips, Elephant Butte, Balanced Rock, the Windows, Turret Arch and Double Arch in an afternoon and got out to walk around several of those areas. There are interesting and informative signs at the trail heads. The second day we returned at sunrise and went to Delicate Arch. We walked to the viewpoint on the southern side first -about .4 mile and it gave an interesting perspective seeing the arch from afar. We also drove to a different trail head and did the 5km return walk. This was quite strenuous and had really icy sections - despite these difficulties it was fantastic to reach the arch itself. We were so early that there were no crowds and we heard that at times there can be queues of up to 50 people.

Then we drove to the parking area where you hike to the arches. It is a pretty good out and back. We had a 3 year old with us, so we just opted to go on the short hike and view the arches from afar.

It is reasonably compact and you can get around most of the main stops in half a day but there's a number of short walks (and lots of longer ones) so it's worth spending more time here if you can.The ground was snow covered in parts which only served to enhance the views but also made some of the paths pretty slippery so we couldn't walk as far as we wanted.We had purchased an annual National Parks pass for $80.

Arches National Park,"We've visited here numerous times and love the place for its scenery, particularly the extraordinary concentration of natural arches that give it its name. Our latest visit was in January, which gives a very different experience from seeing it in peak season -- far fewer people to contend with, and the colors are even more spectacular with snow on the formations, but many of the trails are seriously snow-bound and downright icy. If visiting at this time, unless you're willing to do a ""windshield"" tour (which hardly does the place justice), make sure to bring hiking boots, and hiking poles are a good idea for some of the trails. Note that this is one of the smaller of the national parks of the American West; you can get a good sense of most of the park in a single day, unlike Yellowstone, Grand Canyon, etc. It's still worth taking two or three days to get out and really experience the place, however, and the arch lover can find literally a lifetime's worth of nooks and crannies to explore.","January 27, 2016","One of our favorite national parks, but with some caveats",143,"Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States",4

The thinner air at high altitude effects me, making me more short of breath than usual. The drive through the park is about 18 miles long, we did it in about 3 hrs, stopping for a picnic lunch, walking up to Double Arch and viewing delicate arch from the viewpoint.

Arches National Parks was actually the first park I had ever been too and my first time was an incredible experience. I had never seen anything like it and I was moved almost to the point of tears when reaching Delicate Arch (this is a must-see!). The best way to experience Arches National Park is to slowly drive around the loop road, stopping at each viewpoint/trail and getting out and doing the various short hikes (typically 5-15 minutes) to see each monument. I remember Hidden Arch was a really cool, short hike you want to check out! But more than anything, you HAVE TO DO THE DELICATE ARCH HIKE! It is about a 2 mile hike and well worth it! When we did the hike, we saw people from all ages (4 years old to 60 years old) doing this hike and having a blast. There are some uphill sections, but nothing too difficult.

The info center inside the park was very helpful and the people well informed on current trail conditions. They did, however, try to sell us crampons for our boots because of the snow and they would have been much more of a hindrance than a help, besides being EXTREMELY low quality and certainly not worth the $45 it would have cost for the 3 of us.

Arches National Park,"I feel very fortunate that we visited this place in the ""off-season"". We have so many pictures without a single soul anywhere else in the photo. We could enjoy taking photos and looking around and enjoying the views uninterrupted. As we would move on, another couple would take out place. It truly was amazing. I feel spoiled to have seen this park without a ton of people surrounding me. I had broken arch completely to myself. One couple had started out there and turned around. As the lady passed me she commented, you've seen one arch you've seen them all. What I can tell you is no matter which way you turn, you have a whole new view. I sat out here for quite a while. Total silence and a vast view in front of me..talk about feeling small. I loved itThe snow only added a beautiful contrast to the vast views you have with the Lasal mountain range as a backdrop.

Also saw ""Orion"" come up from the horizon, which I have not experienced elsewhere.Heard the night sky was one of the best in the world, which is probably is, but the light of the full moon obscured seeing a better view of the milky-way. However, still more stars to see compared to most parts of the country.

We happened to go when there was snow on the ground which made it extra beautiful in our minds. Movie at the visitor's center explained how the arches came to see. We thought it was well worth our time. We only planned to spend a day here and thought $25 was a bit steep (it's a week long pass). Wish there was a day rate ($10-$15) and a week rate.

Arches National Park,"The visitor center was a short drive from downtown Moab. Armed with NP Passbooks, we went straight to the stamping station to get our books stamped. The visitor center had much better restroom facilities than the rest of the park. So take note if you're particular about these things.The highlight of our trip was the hike to the Delicate Arch. It was rather strenuous hike as there were icy patches, so definitely get spikes on your hiking boots under such conditions (I was told that visitor center sold spikes in limited quantities). It took about 45min to reach the arch and boy it was a fantastic view! Perched on the edge of the cliff, the Delicate Arch offered a backdrop of miles of scenic landscape. We felt the arch was shaped like a portal and ready to take us to another dimension!The best thing about visiting during winter was the Park became less crowded. We were able to find parking easily for hikes to Upheaval Dome and Devil's Garden. The rest of the attractions were a short walk on easy paths, for example the Balanced Rock, Sand Dune Arch and Skyline Arch.The temperature was in the 20s when we visited.

Bring water--its hot and dry out there. Lots of pulloffs and parking areas. Pit stops here and there--go when you have the chance--you might not see another when you want. A definite destination for everyone's bucket list. It is remote from motels except the town of Moab. I didn't plan well and was lucky to get a room during a race event.

Basically you drive in and you can just drive from one formation to the next. Some formations are seriously right next to where you park, some are a bit of hike. Nothing more than a couple of miles. Probably the hardest hike we did was around 2 miles with less than 1000 feet of elevation change. It was all rock though so if you are used to dirt trails it's harder on your legs. There's a couple of areas where you can just start climbing around and get yourself on top of some smaller rock formations. Overall, very fun and not terribly taxing if you are in reasonably good hiking shape.","December 28, 2015",Super cool. Trails for all levels.,5,"Austin, Texas",5

Landscape and Delicate arches were not accessoble for wheel chair.Landscape arch path was relatively easy with flat and slightly higher pathway on some parts. Delicate arch was a challenge since at the early track we must hike into the small hill without any fence or step , followed by increasing level and at the end with a small path.

The driving route conveniently takes you to all the key sections of the park where you'll have the chance to do some hiking or short walks to viewpoints for older folks. If you like taking in sunrises and sunsets it's worth asking at the visitors center the best places to go.

Arches National Park,"All I can say is WOW!!! I haven't been back here in over 20 years and it was fantastic then as it is now. Great landscape driving to the park. The entrance fee was $25 and it will give you access for up to 7 days. Unfortunately, it doesn't include access to Canyonlands Park. That will be another $25. From the visitor center, it will take about 20 minutes to drive to the Delicate Arch parking area. The hike up will take about an hour or so. Depending on your conditioning. The entire hike is about 3 miles round trip. I wouldn't say the hike is easy, but it is not difficult. Just take your time and make alot of little breaks on the way up. Make sure you bring good shoes as it can get slippery on some spots. The payoff for your hard work is when you get to the top. If you don't want to make the hike up, there are other easy hikes that you can do throughout the park. Landscape Arch, the Windows and Double Arch are a must. These are more like walks than hikes. I would say that these are super easy with no effort whatsoever. You will need at least a full day to enjoy and fully take in the landscape. Would love to come back here when it's warmer so that I can enjoy the night sky.","December 22, 2015",What a VIEW,43,"Los Angeles, California",5

Arches National Park,"We've visited quite a few National Parks in Southern Utah/Arizona and we 'rate' Arches as one of the very best and most spectacular. We visited in mid-September and even then Arches can be quite busy, so perhaps weekends should be avoided although we had no difficulty parking at the various vantage points. In order to appreciate many of the individual arches, it is necessary to park up and walk a distance, so it's essential to bring liquid refreshment as there are seemingly no refreshment booths within the Park. Out in the open, the midday temperatures can be nearly 100° F and this quickly saps one's energy after walking just a few hundred meters from the car, so it pays to be mindful of this when enthusiastically sallying forth to photograph the sights. It wasn't long before we craved an ice cream or a cold drink and it's disappointing that the Park Services don't provide refreshment booths are strategic intervals, which would surely not detract from the pleasure of visiting Arches but would undoubtedly prove a useful additional revenue earner.","December 22, 2015",One of the very best National Parks,108,"Chard, United Kingdom",5

Due to travel delays and rain, we didn't have as much time to spend there as originally planned, but were lucky to do the Delicate Arch hike in light drizzle before the rain picked up and the trail was closed. However the highlight was the trail to Double O Arch, which felt like walking on the spine of the park, on top of the world. Probably the most breathtaking hike I've ever been on! We actually re-arranged our trip to go back to Arches later in the week- which happened to be Columbus Day weekend. We arrived around 11am and it took us over 30 minutes just to get in. The Windows area was absolutely packed, which took away from the experience. Still, it was worth going back to get a second look at things. I can't wait to go back in the future!","December 3, 2015",Absolutely stunning!! But go early and avoid holidays & weekends if possible,23,"Milford, CT",5

If you like to hike, this is a the place for you. If you don't, this is still a fantastic destination.

Arches National Park,.To get in to the park can take a while (the line of cars to get in was extensive even in the off season.) We love this place and the hikes are mostly reasonable for the average person. We went to Double Arch and the Windows (you can park near the windows and walk to Double Arch as well.) We visited the Landscape Arch (recommend this early in the day as it is at the far end of the park and is in the shade later in the day so good pictures can be problematic.) We also hiked a bit of Tower Arch. There is just no way to go wrong at this Park. You can hike or not hike. You can get out and take pictures of sit in your car and take pictures.

Arches National Park,"Even having spent a week in red rock country around southern Utah, this National Park was still spectacular - even on a second visit. It had few people at this time of year and was a pleasure to visit. Lots of nice hikes of relatively short duration mean that you can be quite active during the day. The do-not-miss is the hike to Delicate Arch. Although this has a fair amount of uphill, there were kids as young as 5 who managed it. The close-up view of the arch is not to be missed and one soon forgets any discomfort in getting there!

Arches National Park,"This place is amazing. We managed to wake up for sunrise, but I wished that we got into the park another 20-30 minutes prior so I could have set up for photos in a place a little further in. Delicate Arch hike is a bit of a lung buster at times, but it is really worth it when you turn that corner and see the arch from such a different perspective. It's a little scary when you're walking in the ""bowl"" type structure before the arch, but it's so cool. Before you get to the arch on your right there's another little arch that it looks like you can't climb up to, but you can. Just keep your momentum going. The view is phenomenal through that little arch. I can't believe I forgot to take my camera up. Then I just came down on my butt. The whole park is really amazing. Wear shoes with good tread for the Delicate arch hike.","December 2, 2015",Delicate Arch hike is worth it,23,Lowell,5

Arches National Park,"We spent a whole day hiking and exploring Arches and my advice to you is to hike up to Delicate Arch first! It's a long hike up a mountain with no stairs and you should make sure to bring plenty of water. Its not impossible however, my fiancé and I saw an elderly couple make it up there (although they did need to borrow water bottles). The view is second to none.The rest of the park is fun too and great for small hikes and picnics throughout.

Several can be spotted from the road and can be captured by photo. There is only 1 main road (19 miles one way) with scenic stops.

It gets chilly in November, especially when the sun disappears behind cloud, so make sure you bring warm clothing. There are loads of very accessible hikes all through the park and facilities in certain areas. There is also an audio guide that you can download onto your phone for about $4 that gives you a great commentary as you drive through the park. It's activated by your phone's GPS so starts and stops at the appropriate points as you drive along - very clever!It's $25 per car to get in and that buys you unlimited entry for 7 days - pretty decent value. You can also camp at the park. Access to the park is 24 hours so a great place for stargazing and astrophotography as well.

There are some great views of snowcapped mountains and some interesting rock formations. We hiked up to the Delicate Arch. Unfortunately it was raining. There were not a lot of people due to the dangerous conditions. We attempted the hike. It was slippery at times, and a gradual incline. Once we got to the top we saw the Delicate Arch but did not attempt to get any closer to it because we could hear lightning and thunder. It was still a beautiful sight to see. We made our way down very very slowly. It is about a 6km hike, difficult at times and even more so with the rain. Beautiful views once you get up there.

It was warm and you should always carry a bottle of water. There were a few refill stations in the park. If you go on a lengthy hike you should be prepared to carry at least 2 liters per person.

The drive through the park is full of 'Wow' factor with the colouring and shapes of the 2000+ natural stone arches and balancing rocks really mind boggling. It truly is amazing what nature can do.

In mid-November it was between 48-56 degrees which turned out to be perfect hiking weather. There was some snow on the ground but it was melting. I recommend bringing water, snacks, lunch, hiking sticks, a hat, sunglasses and a good camera. We wore three layers so we could peel sweaters and jackets off as needed, hiking shoes and thin gloves. I would do that again. This park can pretty well be covered in 1 day. I recommend stopping in the visitor center and getting the ranger's recommendations.

Arches National Park,"The beauty of Arches National Park has been expounded upon again and again. The only thing better than the arches is the night sky. Most people have really never seen a truly dark sky. If you are in Moab, go to the windows area and look at the sky. You can see stars like you've never seen before. The Milky Way is clearly visible and if you know where to look, you can see the Andromeda galaxy.

Also - we arrived at the parking lot for Delicate Arch right after sunrise....and the tour bus had beaten us there! I would try to get there right AT sunrise to try and get ahead of that. Still - the crowd wasn't so bad, you just had to wait a little to take picture under the arch. Everyone was well-behaved.

It was drizzling a bit and we were warned at the Park entrance that the rocks could get slippery when wet.Be as it may, we started the trek a little after 4 PM and it is an approximately 2+ mile (5.25+ km) hike (round trip). There is a bit of a climb but is worth it to get a view of the Delicate Arch. Aptly named! A fine example of what rain and wind can do.

Beautiful and I felt so accomplished to have made it as we are both in the Senior Adult category. Definitely bring a camera and be sure your shoes are walking shoes.

We didn't realize advanced booking was required and didn't get to do it - now we have to go back :-)Best hike was to Double Arch - its long and rigorous but I felt incredibly accomplished for completing it! On the way back we hiked across one of the fins - it was marked until we came to the end of the fin and then we got a bit lost. Eventually found the trail but hated to walk in areas not intended. Better signage is recommended at this point. Go here and plan to see some amazing sites!!","November 7, 2015",Incredibly beautiful,10,"Barrie, Canada",5
Arches National Park,"Arches has wonderful new visitor center with a very educational museum. Children see Arches with different eyes. They were fascinated by how the rocks of sands could be crushed in their hands, and this helped them grasp the concept of how the Arches were formed. We visited Double Arch which is a fun and easy climb. It was 103 degrees, but once we got under the shadow of the arches it was fine. We choose Double Arch because it was closest to the road with an easy walk-in. It was just too hot to hike. I wish we had had more time. From what I read on the internet, the Park Service is considering limiting entry into the park by reservations because there is so much traffic entering the the park. We were lucky and did not have a problem (the 103 degrees probably helped), but definitely check with the park service before you go. The National Parks website is excellent, but the rules of Trip Advisor did not allow me to post the link for you.","November 7, 2015",Even more fun with kids.,49,,5

We did the devils garden hike which was a little challenging in some sections but mostly was quite easy and the scenery was just spectacular. BIG TIP - I highly recommend getting there as early as you can. Firstly the temperature is much more pleasant to hike in, secondly the light at this time shows the rocks at their best, thirdly you will have the place almost to yourself. Just as we were heading back to the car hoards of visitors started pouring in.

Arches National Park,"I love Arches National Park. This would be a beautiful place to see, even if there were no arches -- the landscape is that breathtaking. If you're tight on time, at least be sure to hike out to Landscape Arch. It's every bit as breathtaking as Delicate Arch -- maybe more so. There is a short hike where you're able to see Delicate Arch from a distant viewpoint, but I highly recommend taking the time to hike the 1.5 mile trail up to the site of the Arch. A couple of words of advice -- when the signs say they recommend carrying water on this hike, pay attention. Even if it's 70 degrees outside. You will be glad you carried that quart of water. Also, the Delicate Arch hike is not for a mom trying to corral four children under the age of 8, or for grandma in her walker. I saw both of these heading up to the trail from the parking lot, and was tempted to tell them to just turn around. You gain about 500 feet in elevation over a 1.5 mile trail, in thinner air than you may be used to breathing. You don't need to be a world-class athlete or anything -- I certainly am not -- but you can't be a person who gets short of breath if they can't get an up-close parking spot at Wal-Mart. You need to be able to briskly walk 2-3 miles on level ground without stopping, I think, to be up for this climb. The climb up to the Arch is taxing, but if you think you're up for it, you'll remember the reward at the top for the rest of your life. So lace up those boots (OK, tennis shoes are OK, but no heels), get your quart of water, and head up! Don't forget to stop by and see the Petroglyphs on the way back down, too!","November 5, 2015",Spellbinding!,103,"Greenville, Texas",5

Arches National Park,"My wife and I visited this park 15 years ago with our children but we only had a few hours in the evening which is nowhere near enough time. For this visit we spent an evening and almost a full day here and still felt like we came up way short. For the first evening, we went to the double arches area. The lighting in the evening was phenomenal and it was a truly magical experience watching the light change across all of the different rock structures. After that experience, we decided to get up early and find another place to watch the sunrise in the park. After some research the night before about best places to watch the sunrise in the park, we ended back at the exact same location. Were we glad we did! The sunrise was stunning. For photographs, we took a trail to the east side of double arches and the views of the double arches, etc at that time of the day was something to behold. We spent several hours here before eventually moving to other locations further into the park which we had never visited before. We were able to take several short hikes to get a feel for some of the other areas which is when we realized there was still much more to this park than we had allotted time for.","October 31, 2015",You need to spend a lot of time here,52,"Rochester, MN",5

Arches National Park,"Arches National Park is indeed a national treasure. The play of light over the rock formations throughout the course of a day is amazing. Some of the features range from the amazing to the weird. Visiting on a Saturday in late October found the park very busy. Every parking lot to each feature was nearly full. We were told by a Moab resident that, this past Labor Day weekend, they had to stop allowing visitors into the park because it was full to overflowing. If, you are considering visiting, don't come during a national holiday. Interestingly, we heard that few people travel to Moab to view Arches during the snowy winter months when, I can only imagine, it would be even more magical than it already is.Our only disappointment on this visit was that, due to 3 days of rain prior to our arrival, the road to Delicate Arch was damaged and closed for repair.

They are may be not suitable for very infirm people and wheelchairs may also have a problem but a lot of the features are visable from the car parks.

Arches National Park,"First, this place is AMAZING! I think a lot of the reviews on here have already touted its geologic phenomenon and grandeur so I'm going to skip that part. You just have to make it out to Arches at least once in your lifetime. Second, go during non-peak seasons - fall or early spring. We were there mid September. The weather was cooler but the sun was still up; however, even then there were a lot of visitors. It wasn't as crowded as many other places but definitely not sparse enough. I would suggest late september for the best fall colors in Nebo Loop and less crowds at Arches National Park. If you're driving from Salt Lake City and doing a day trip from there to here, do not do the Native Trail back from the Devils Garden area - it is tough and will take a lot of time. Instead, finish the trail and come back the way you came so you can hit other areas such as the delicate arch. This trail is difficult and will take some time to complete as well. We didn't get to do the Fiery Furnace as it requires reservations. If you have to choose between the different areas to go through, I suggest Devils Garden because Partition Arch is the BEST arch you'll visit. The panaromic view from there is BREATHTAKING. I wish I had more time to just sit there and enjoy the view. Do Devils Garden and if you're not tired, head back to do Delicate Arch.","October 24, 2015",I don't know what else to say that hasn't been said,72,"Seattle, Washington",5

Then we headed to the Landscape Arch - the surroundings of this one are also amazing (Devil's Garden), but it's a big area that takes more time. And so there was not much time left to see the Delicate Arch therefore we settled for seeing it from the viewpoint only.. Oh what a poor view - it's too far away! You see the Arch soooo tiny and you can't approach it, there is a canyon (beautiful) between you and the arch.

We were glad we had the RV, because toilet facilities were few and far between.

We stopped here on Labor Day, so there were others at the arch (expected), but there were plenty of spots to view the sunrise. Unfortunately, there were a bunch of photographers trying to capture the arch and they felt the need to ask people viewing the scenery to move, but other than that the morning was perfect. It was a very short walk from the parking lot to the arch, very doable for almost any level of fitness. The day was a bit overcast, but we lucked out. Once the sun came up, it started to drizzle and we were lucky enough to see a double rainbow stretching from one arch to another. It was incredible! The roads in between viewpoints are well maintained and easy to navigate. We stopped at Sand Dune Arch and that was also very beautiful.

Pack a lunch and bring lots of water and wear sunscreen, as well as hiking shoes and comfortable clothing. Of course, do not forget your cameras and video recording devices. FYI, the hike up to Delicate Arch is not for the faint of heart nor the physically-challenged. It is a three mile hike (round trip) up a steep, treacherous and at times slippery path. There are also three narrow (4 ft wide) ledges with no railings which must be traversed before reaching Delicate Arch. I attempted the hike, but decided it was too dangerous for my level of comfort. I stopped midway up and took refuge under the only shade tree while my husband carefully journeyed on. He took great photos of the arch which I thoroughly enjoyed. However, I also enjoyed the safety and sanity of the shade tree. Later, he admitted that when he approached the three narrow ledges, he hugged the side of the mountain, pressing his back against the rock and waved the other hikers to go pass him.

Arches National Park,"When we decided to visit the area and Arches National Park the price quoted for a 7 days pass was $10 per vehicle.When we arrived that price had gone up to $25 per vehicle (Canyonlands was the same). I know the original price is good value but 150% rise for a park that has little in facilities is a little steep. Again when is comes to facilities Canyonlands is worse.However, for all my moaning the scenery is well worth visiting as is most of Utah. The rock formations and the in the area are amazing and the views through ""Park Avenue"" are really worth the visit alone. However, the star attraction is ""Delicate Arch"" perched high on the edge of the rocks. There three ways to see the arch. For the super fit and properly attired there is a three mile round walk that takes you right up to the arch. If like me you are not as fit as you used to be there is a mile round walk that takes you close to the arch and with a long range lens you can cheat and say you got real close. For those who want to say hey there it is it can be seen from a parking lot from a distance away.Not the biggest of Nation Parks but definitely worth a visit and the town of Moab is the perfect place to stay.","October 18, 2015",Well worth a visit,237,"Henley-on-Thames, United Kingdom",4

Arches National Park,"An exquisitely beautiful park filled with world class scenery. Even though being known mostly for two famous arches, Delicate Arch and Landscape Arch, there are many wonderful trails and many lesser known spots to see. We spent two full days in the park and were happy to have done that. The best choices we made were to arrive early at the trail to Landscape Arch before the crowds arrived. Before we came back from the hike the parking lot was full and the trip would have been much less pleasant. We got the benefit of the morning sun and it made the visit very pleasant. After, we went to the south end of the campground and took the side trail to Calico Arch and were the only people there. It was beautiful and absolutely worth the short trip. By the time we were walking back, only one other couple was making the trip. This ""private"" side trip was when the other parking lots were filled with people wanting to see the big name attractions. Another favorite was Double Arch in the ""Windows"" section of the park. Only a very short walk and again well worth your time. Originally we had planned to do the ""Big 5"" parks all on the same vacation but are now extremely happy with staying in Moab and seeing all the area instead of rushing through.","October 17, 2015",Spectacular scenery,9,"Portland, Oregon",5

That said, if you spend a little time with the exhibits it will really enhance your visit to the park, whether you are a drive by type or a multi-day walk your buns off person. I'd also suggest you subscribe to the ""Climb Utah"" web site. It will really give you some guidance about the vast number of wonderful hikes you can explore - with gps coordinates if you need them - but we found most trails very well marked.They advise you take plenty of water and we were amazed at the number of people wearing flip flops, no hat, and no water.

The park ranger was excellent in directing us to the most scenic view points. The Arches Visitor Guide (newspaper received at entrance) is very detailed and informative for your visit. The monoliths are appropriately named. Park Avenue is a mile walk one way. The rocks resemble tall skyscrapers in New York. Balanced Rock is incredible--how can that huge rock stay atop the other formation?? There are numerous natural rock cairns throughout the area. The Three Gossips is very interesting; it resembles 3 women's profile. We were unable to view the famous Delicate Arch due to rains the day before which closed the road. I hiked atop the Double Arch (.5 mile), my husband didn't want to walk anymore. This was well worth the steep climb, difficult walk due to high elevations. It encapsulates the wonders and glory of God's beautiful creation!

I started the trail a little before 4pm and was at the parking lot by 6:35. The only site on the map I did not trek to was Dark Angel because it did not appear to be an Arch and I was Arch hunting!

The ranger tour was only $10 pp, $5 for kids. The private tours are around $100 pp. I went with my daughter and her two boys, age 8 and 5. The boys loved it because it is like ""American Ninja Warrior"". In addition to climbing up and down rocks, there is an area where you have to traverse by having your hands on one large rock face and your feet on another rock face.

Arches National Park,"This is a very popular and often crowded National Park, and for good reasons. It is a few miles from Moab and it is rather large. Since there is only one entrance, there are often long lines at the entrance, so you may consider coming early or late in the day. Because of the vastly of the park and many attractions, the crowd vanishes after the toll booth, although you may have difficult in finding a parking place if you want to hike in the two most popular places. The park is a plateau on top of a large salt bed with layers upon layers of different sandstones and rock formations, reshaped by the activity of the Moab fault. The various arches are therein attraction but there are beautiful rock formations, colored salt deposits and magnificent vistas from all sides. The drive across the park takes about one hour one way with stops and it is beautiful. A side drive to the window section and delicate arch is recommended.There are a few short walks and two medium length: the delicate arch, less than 2 h loop, and the devils garden. This is a loop of 2-3 h with a section of primitive trail which requires some relatively easy sandstone rock climbing. The park has no facilities except for a 50 spaces camping which is usually booked months ahead.","October 9, 2015",Offering much more than arches,667,"Cleveland, Oh",5

Arches National Park,"You know that if the state's license plate uses a rendition of a geologic feature, you best go see the feature. The Delicate Arch is around 3/4 of the way through the 26 mile drive through Arches National Park. There are two viewing locations that really don't require much of a hike. If you go see it, get there at sunset. Arches NP is a fantastic location for night photography, but keep in mind that the temperature can drop pretty sharply. Its elevation and remote location make for a very dark sky, and pretty bright starlight. Unfortunately, I was there when the skies were cloudy, and even if they hadn't been, the waning-from-full moon lit the sky quite a lot. As a suggestion of a nice place to shoot, go to the amphitheater in the campground.

The majestic, weird and eerie rock formations are an amazing sight to see. We felt like we were in the Twilight Zone where aliens or foreign beings lived - so different than any other landscape. The paths and hiking trails were so nice; some were short and others were long. To get to the more popular arches involved a longer walk (about 1 1/2 miles); I didn't do it but my husband did.My favorite scenic hike/path was the Devil's Garden; the path started out between two huge rock formations and extended on out to other scenic areas.

Arches National Park,"If you love to explore the effects of rain, snow, temperature and wind on an environment, this is a good place to start. Arches is part of a pre-historic ocean that once covered much of the middle United States. The land under the ocean rose and receded at least seven times. Each time a new layer of sediment was build up.Arches shows what happened to the top layers of sediment and how they gracefully eroded into rock arches and finned structures.There is quite a bit of wild life in the park. You need to look for it, but it is not too difficult to find rabbits, snakes, lizards, birds, insects and other creatures.We thought this was the perfect place to start our tour of the area. We went to Arches, Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks. Each tells a different story about how this area was formed changed over millions of years.

Also not to be missed is Sand Dune Arch. Another is Delicate Arch. You can chose the strenuous walk that takes you right to the arch, or the semi strenuous walk that allows you to admire it from a distance.

All of those are easily accessible after short and easy hikes. Don't miss Dead Horse Point:absolutely impressive.We only went to Arches at 15:30! There is a long line of cars in the morning, unless you go early enough. You need morning and evening light for maximum results. The track to the end is 24 km long.We started in the lower area because the afternoon light is much better there. Courthouse Wash Rock Art Panel at the very beginning had full sunlight, the back part when you drive around it was of course in the shadow, but not if you return in the morning. Balanced Rock has 2 accessible sides and is ok throughout the day.The important Windows section is a visit for later in the afternoon: North and South WIndow are in perfect sunlight, alredy warming up; opposite those two you will find Turret Arch, in the shadow but you can climb through the hole and find it in perfect sunlight, offering the opportunity to make a picture of both north and south through the hole of Turret Arch; Double arch has full shadow.The best known is Delicate arch, definitely for the later evening, about an hour BEFORE sunset. Everybody goes there for sunset pictures, but read this well: don't do it! Light is much better some time before that, if you wait too long it will lose power, you will lose detail and get long shadows. Moreover, it is a long and strenuous walk even for good hikers. We left at the parking lot an hour and 1/4 before sunset, got up there, took our pictures and got the hell aut of there for a long hike back. If you wait until sunset, you have walk back in the dark and you don't want to do that!The next morning we started around 9 at landscape arch (end of september! earlier in summer) at the very end of the park, came back to the Windows section in the middle and found Double arch in the best light you can get.

Arches National Park,"Our first vist to Arches was almost twenty years ago. We were a young family, with two children-one seven; one tween. We enjoyed Arches then. We enjoyed it just as much now. As one fellow visitor remarked; as we chatted at one of the overlooks, ""these views just never get old, do they?"" We drove our 24' motorhome thru the park; stopping at every overlook. There was ample parking, for both cars & RV's; which made the visit less stressful. Beauty abounds in this park, and we were in awe of its views. I especially enjoyed the variety of vegetation- trees/flowers/dessert grasses, etc. There are multiple hiking trails, for every skill level; several were handicap accessible. Plan your day according to your ability; to ensure you don't miss out. Bring LOTS OF WATER! STAY HYDRATED! It is a dry heat, and it's impacts can be harmful if you don't hike with common sense. Hydration stations are available. Use frequently. The sunset views were spectacular!!! Worth an extra trip, or two!?! Park accessible by bike, foot, personal vehicle, or via tour group/bus. Entrance fee, for personal vehicles, includes all occupants. Bike/On foot is per person. Tip: PROPER FOOTWEAR is ESSENTIAL!!! Bring along your camera, with lots of memory and a well charged battery.

Arches National Park,Stayed late to catch the sunset views. Easy drives and short hikes for the most part. Carry water on longer hikes. Fairly crowded park.

Arches National Park,We started out with a stop at the NP Visitors Center. Excellent displays and explinations of geography and history of the area. Many short hikes and some longer ones; mostly depends on your fitness levels and how you deal with the heat. Take plenty of water. We took many pictures of this amazing park. Near the Wolfe Farm site we discovered some Petroglyphs on a small side loop path. We also saw the Delicate Arch on this first day. The next daywe drove up to the Devils Garden area and view many arches on that hike. We found some nice shade under the backside of Pine Tree Arch to eat the lunch we had brought with us.,"September 30, 2015","Two full days of exploring, hiking, and driving.",53,"Scottsbluff, Nebraska",5
Arches National Park,"I have been to Utah many times and finally got to Moab and Arches National Park. This is truly a special place to see. Give yourself a few days there are so many arches and you will want to see all, good luck. The landscape is fascinating and when you look up and spot an arch it gets even better. If you hike around carry plenty of water, I was there in June and the dry air will dry you out so keep drinking. I walked all I could and still need to return. Even the entry into the park begins to set you up for the experience you are about to have.Delicate Arch is amazing! Landscape arch is very grand and broad. It also has views through it. Also look down the vegetation of the desert is also something to explore.","September 30, 2015",One of God's gifts,24,"Wilmington, Massachusetts",5
Arches National Park,"Beautiful scenery even from the main road. There are several short hikes to even better scenery and several arches. The hike to Delicate Arch was very strenuous and almost all up hill, so only attempt it if you have plenty of time and in reasonably good shape. The view at Delicate Arch is beautiful especially near sunset, but you will probably be surrounded by hundreds of other tourists and may face a difficult hike back in the dark. The park itself is large so it held a lot of people without seeming overly crowded. Be prepared for long lines entering the park between 9:00 - 12:00. When I was there, the entrance gate closed at 5:00 so you can enter no charge. You can exit at any time.","September 30, 2015",Beautiful sights,14,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5

There are numerous sandstone arches naturally eroded over millions of years. Many are within easy walking distance from the road. Among the most difficult to reach is Delicate Arch, the Utah state symbol and a magnificent edifice. To see it up close, it takes a 3-mile round trip trek, of which the first part can be a difficult uphill hike. Make sure you take plenty of water as there is no shade or shelter on the trail.

While most of the trails and arches are out in the open and on ""hard"" pathways in the baking sun, the relatively short walk to the Sand Dune Arch is on pink sand and amongst towering sandstone that offers a cool respite from the sun.Kids that I saw seemed to especially relish the walk and then the ""play area"" under and near the arch.There are many other arches and sandstone formations to see.

We arrived around 10:00 to find cars and RVs queuing to get in, but once we were through the gate it seemed that the vehicles had dispersed and our drive through the park wasn't one long traffic queue as feared.Although the information says that there are numerous arches, we didn't see as many as we expected to. I loved seeing the Turret and the North and South Windows - stunning views from one to the other. It is good to know how far you are expected to walk to the various arches, windows and other things of interest, especially for those of us who find it difficult to walk far. There is the chance to walk further and explore more challenging terrain in order to view some of the other arches. The heat did make such exploration more challenging, so you should heed the advice about taking water.There are toilets at intervals around the park, but the only flushing toilets are at the top, so prepare to hold your nose if using the other type! There is also a drinking water tap at the top of he park.

Never-the-less, the grandeur of this place is breathtaking. We took several trails, the most challenging being to the Delicate Arch, and that was due to the heat. BRING LOTS OF WATER! This can't be overstated. We saw people with serious heat and sun stroke.

Many signs to encourage folks to carry adequate water for a hike in the desert. The most rewarding hike we did was to Delicate Arch from the Wolf Ranch. The hike is a bit strenuous but worth all of the effort which comes at the very last second as you round a corner at the top. As a 60 yr. old (out of shape) I had to talk my husband into attempting this hike and he now thinks it was the highlight of our vacation in Utah. We took our time for a rest and water break now and then. The hike goes up over slick rock which is not at all slick. Round trip took us about 3 hours. Best to do early in the day to avoid heat.

One can reach the 306 foot long Landscape Arch without any exposure to heights. Soon after there are a couple of places where acrophobes should retreat. 3.5 hours to hike much of Devil's Garden area. Favorite was Partition Arch - great for romantic photo op! We ultimately saw over a dozen lovely arches in various areas over about 6 hours.

Arches National Park,"We visited late August and stayed at Slickrock RV park in Moab (absolute recommend). The first thing we did after we arrived in the afternoon was hike the trail to Delicate Arch so we could see the sunset there. It was a cool experience to hear the clicking of all the cameras and the shouts from everybody when we finally had those few seconds of gorgeous light on the arch. We descended quite fast, but if you're a slow walker, bring headlights or a torch as it goes dark quite quickly and it's not even walking everywhere. The next day we hiked in Devil's Garden and took the primitive trail back. We started around 8, when the heat was still bearable. In all the info you get about the park, it states to bring a gallon (approx. 4 liters) water per person when hiking. We had about 3 liters per person with us, but we used almost all of it. The hike wasn't particularly difficult - although the primitive trail isn't always clearly marked and involves scrambling over rocks - but the heat of the sun and the rocks mean that you dehydrate very quickly. And there is no water on the trails: you're in the desert! We were happy to be back at our car around 13.00 where we had some more water. That evening, we visited the Windows section of the park, which is very nice and pretty accessible. We thought it was a great park to have visited. You can spend more time in the park, but for us and I think for most people, a day and a half was enough.","September 24, 2015",Bring plenty of water to this gorgeous park,89,"Amstelveen, The Netherlands",4

This is a very popular park so expect tour buses. At a few places it can get crowded. There is also more than just arches here. The whole landscape is incredible. One arch you really have to work to get to. The delicate arch is the one usually pictured. It is a good up-hill walk to reach it. The sign said 1.1 miles, I believe, but it seemed much longer. Take water with you, especially if it's hot. Very little shade until you reach the arch. Part of the walk is up-hill on bare, smooth rock. It is worth it when you get there but bpeople with physical handicaps may find it difficult.","September 23, 2015","The Arches are a ""must see"".",28,"Winchester, Virginia",5

Arches National Park,"Really hard to describe how amazing this Park is - you really need to go see it yourself. There are easy drives through the place, and a good variety of hikes - it's easy to do a short walk to get up-close-and-personal, which is definitely worthwhile. The Visitor Center is very helpful, and it adds to your enjoyment to know at least a little about the geography behind these stunning formations. The Park Rangers are busy, but super helpful and patient with everyone - join a guided walk for all sorts of interesting tidbits.

We walked upto Delicate Arch and the view was amazing, this is simply a must, I walked up after 6 weeks recovery from 2 operations on ankle and it was a fair bit pain but worth it. take plenty water no mater how fit you are!!!!We saw 2 couples carrying babies under 6 months old and we thought this was simply insane, this is a fairly vigorous hike and you need good hiking boots to support ankles.well worth it.","September 23, 2015",Delicate Arch,60,Murthly,5

Delicate Arch has viewpoint that is easy to access instead of the hike up to it. Cove Arch was cool to see and easy to access. Lots to see while driving through the Park and places to park and get out and walk. We learned about Cryptobiotic soil crust is a living ground cover that forms the foundation of high desert plant life in Arches and the surrounding area. It is black in color and will turn greenish when water is dropped on it.

They DO NOT SELL BOTTLED WATER! they do sell water bottles and have places to fill your bottle. I like this policy because it cuts down on waste of bottled water. I did not know this so I had to buy a bottle and still didnt have enough water for the day. You need at least 2 - 3 litres of water.

It really can't be captured in photos, and even if you think you know what to expect, it's going to surprise you.

But bring your own water...LOL. Let's just say it isn't about the amenities. (Utah's favorite sign = No Services) j/k. We were there in August and it was not crowded, no problems parking. It was 105F. We got there early and went back to the hotel in the afternoon. Park Pass good for 7 days. Bring water, snacks, a cooler is helpful, and wear a hat.

Arches National Park,"As with many things, you have to go early or other people will ruin your experience. We pulled up to the Windows section early (9ish). We had a lot of photos with us alone with the arches. By 11:00 there were vehicles everywhere and long lines to the pit toilets. We totally skipped the Delicate Arch section because of...people. (We chose sanity over iconic beauty). It is beautiful if you can find a piece to enjoy with minimal crowds. I would love to go back and spend time hiking every trail in the off-season. But stupid people will ruin your time here unless you go early or stay in the park. Two examples: one child climbed up to the ledge of Double Arch and couldn't get down...his parent was very far away. Another child (maybe 4 years old) just started climbing up the slopes of another arch, accidentally kicked some rock loose, spiraling down at quite a speed (and with sharp edges) landing and smashing about 5 feet from a family. Short version: GO! But go early or late in the day or in the off-season. If you stay at the campground, don't let the heat stop you...we avoided camping because of the heat, but I found the dry evening heat (85 degrees) cool enough for a light sweater...seriously.","September 20, 2015",Go early if you hate people,44,Iowa,4
Arches National Park,"Arches is beyond words. It's a great park for families as most of the arches are easily accessible. There is one road in and out of the park. The trails start at each parking lot along that road. The trails are easy and accessible and not very long at all. The most difficult trail was to Delicate Arch, as you have to hike a steep rock face. I recommend starting from the back of the park and working your way back towards the front. Also, get there early, before 9 AM as the line to get into the park can get long. A little secret, there's an amazing trail in the back campground - it's quite and just as beautiful!

Delicate Arch is truly amazing - the photos cannot prepare you for the effect when you round the corner on a narrow ledge and suddenly see this completely freestanding arch set out on the edge of a huge, bowl-like expanse of sandstone. I do not recommend this hike for young children or those with a strong fear of heights.

Don't forget lots of film or SD cards for your camera. Mornings and evenings are best for pictures. Middle of the days are a bit harsh for the lighting in pictures.

Arches National Park,"Some of the most spectacular, imposing scenery you will ever encounter. From narrow spires to massive walls, to the odd but intriguing hoodoos to the ""windows"", everything has its own beauty. Many sites (Park Avenue, Courthouse Towers, Petrified Desert, to name a few) can be viewed just by parking and stepping out of your car, some require only a short walk (Sand Dune Arch, Balancing Rock, Double Window) and some are a serious don't-do-this-without-water hikes (Delicate Arch, Pine Tree Arch/Trail's End, Devil's Canyon). The rugged beauty of the different sandstone features etched against the blue sky is breathtaking, but even the desert landscape is awe-inspiring. Our favorites were Double Arch, an easy walk to 2 superimposed arches, with a view of a stratified wall behind them, and Sand Dune Arch. Don't know why it's called that; it's a moderate (half mile or so) walk through some really intriguing slot canyons. We also really enjoyed studying the petroglyphs that can be found a short way up the much longer trail to Delicate Arch. But every single viewpoint and feature is worth at least a few minutes.You can enjoy the splendor of the park pretty much without going far from your car if stamina or mobility is an issue- no one should feel that Arches is not for them.

Arches National Park,"I loved the park. There is a lot of hiking or walking to get to the arches. Our favorite arch was Delicate which is quite a hike so you need to be in good condition. It is about 3.3 miles and up hill, but so worth it. The pictures could never reveal the feeling you have when you are right there. It is awesome. I hope the arch stays standing as long as I live. The other arch that we loved the most was the Landscape arch, wow! It is a distance to the arch, but more of a trail, not as much hiking. You can see 2 other arches along the way and if you want to hike 7.2 miles you can see some other arches. I believe this place should be on your bucket list of places to see before you die and better yet before you are 65, because you need to be in good shape to get to the arches and some of them may not stay standing for a long time. I think 2 days in the park is a good stay. You can see a lot of good stuff in 4 hours to 1 day, but it can exhaust you and you will miss a lot of good stuff. The park is open 24 hours which makes it good to start early or go late to keep cool cause it can get really hot. You are in the desert and there is very little shade. There is not food in the park and very few picnic tables. Bring water with you, you will want it.","September 15, 2015",Got to see!,19,"West Bountiful, Utah",5

We felt like we were in a festival -- people were helping others take photographs, talking, enjoying the pristine quiet and the reduction of heat. We would recommend going in September-December when the crowds are mostly from Europe (so interesting to chat with them) and fewer people come, so you can experience the peace and staggering beauty without feeling cramped.","September 15, 2015",Yes yes yes yes,134,"Los Angeles, California",5

Obviously, you can spend more time if you want, but my wife and I were able to do the following in one full day (originally we planned for 2 days visit). Stop at La Sal mts viewpoint, then 1-hour ranger-led program at Three Gossips, short hike to Double Arch, Delicate Arch, drive in Salt Valley, hike to Landscape Arch. For outdoor enthusiasts I highly recommend Devil’s Garden and Fiery Furnace.

Arches National Park,"We went here 3 days ago and really enjoyed it. Also visited this park with the nation park pass,its way cheaper when you visit 4 parks in a row. In the beginning of the park you will find some stunning rock formations. After that the arches will appear. Truly amazing how mother nature creates things like these. Tip; go to Delicate arch by foot, its quite a trail with a lot of different levels, but the view is worth it! Be sure you bring some water, we walked about 1,5 hour round trip when it was 34 degrees. After our visit we had dinner in Moab, 'cause there are more restaurants in this area than in Green River were we stayed (way cheaper though!)","September 14, 2015",Lovely park!,21,,5

Arches National Park,"As always, Arches is one of the most beautiful and wonderous national parks to visit. Delicate Arch is a must see as well as Fiery Furnace. I had the opportunity to hike to Delicate Arch this time around. Although the climb could be rather arduous at times, the view was worth it. Once you're up there, you think to yourself, ""What is the point of going to the lower viewing area?"" There is no point! If you can make the climb, do it. Get there early to beat the crowds (8 am or earlier) and the heat. CARRY WATER! There's a reason there's a million signs posted around the park saying this. It gets hot there and you will go through more water than you think. On the way back down from Delicate Arch, we went down the little petroglyph trail. I love petroglyphs, so this detour was worth it to me. If you're not into the cultural aspect, I would say skip it. Fiery Furnance is gorgeous, especially in the afternoon as the sun is setting. I wish I had time that day to visit Park Avenue as well as do the hike out to Landscape Arch. You can drive around and get the highlights, but spending two to three days here is not a bad idea.

The hike up to Delicate Arch can be a little tiring for experienced hikers, but the up close view is not to be missed. For individuals who aren't as comfortable with hiking, there are multiple arches that are accessible by a short walk from a parking area. For the more adventurous, there are 4x4 roads which lead to hard to access arches, although listen to the Park Rangers and trust them when they say the roads are difficult or impassable. As a bonus, the Park is open 24 hours, and it's distance from Moab and other towns makes it a great spot for star gazing.

We went about 9:30 in the morning, and personally, thought this to be a good time as the heat was rapidly rising, and is probably quite unbearable mid-day/afternoon.

Everything from lookout points you can stop your car at, very short hikes most anyone with some mobility could walk to, and longer hikes that a person with more endurance for heat and climbing would like. Even the 1-mile or so hikes that said ""strenuous"" did not feel ""dangerous"" or undoable, they just involved some steep inclines, and you might need to go slow. They are NOT KIDDING about the water--even if you are normally not a water drinker, you MUST drink water, you will be shocked how thirsty you get in the desert sun!

Arches National Park,Absolutely stunning views! Have been coming to Colorado for many years and kept saying we need to go to Moab. Well this year when we flew into Grand Junction we went to Utah at the beginning of our trip. It is about a 2 hr drive from GJ and very worth the drive. When you drive up I-70 take the exit for Hwy 128 to get to Moab. It is a scenic road that follows the river into Moab. A little bit further than just taking the regular route into Moab but worth the drive for the view. It is $10 a car for entrance into the park but it is good for 7 days I believe. We spent about a day 1/2 at the park but could have spent longer but we were meeting friends in Aspen. We got a kick out of seeing what the shapes the the enormous rock looked like to us. Could keep your young kids enthused by playing this game with them. For those going to Delicate Arch the hike is only about 3 miles round trip but I can tell you take plenty of water because it is not a super easy hike. You climb quite a bit and be sure to at least wear some steady tennis shoes. Those that I saw in flip flops it was probably not the easiest hike for you!! The views are breathtaking. If you are afraid of heights once you get up to the arch this might not be easy but you can go get underneath the Arch and have plenty of room without getting too close to the edge. I am definitely coming back another time when I have more time to spend.

Chip's enthusiasm for what he does and his love of these National Parks made our trip that much better. There is no other way that we could have seen and experienced all that we did.

Arches National Park,"We visited Arches in mid Aug 2015, during the peak of summer, and we enjoyed every minute of it. Planning an itinerary:------------------Must see spots are the North and South Windows, the Turret Arch, the Double Arch, the Delicate Arch, and the Landscape Arch. Some of the sights such as the Balanced Rock can be done from a vehicle. We spent about 1.5 days here, and comfortably saw these locations. Most of these arches can be visited with low to moderate effort (even the primitive trail around the Windows is not too difficult.)However, the walk to the Delicate Arch is something else - so plan ahead. I was a bit stressed here as we set off late in the evening (around 6pm), and I was worried about risking a night time hike on our return. Fortunately, we made it back by 8:45pm while there was still light out. Other tips:---------------------------Take a lot of water, especially in summer. We had a couple of bottles of water just for soaking our baseball caps.A styrofoam ice box worked very well.We did not have a problem with parking - though I was very nervous about it. I never had to wait for a spot. The situation is likely very different in June or July.For the Windows arches, note that there is another parking lot just north of it at the Double arch. So, if you don't find a spot in the first lot, just keep going around until you reach the second.Take a hiking stick and a wide brim hat if possible. A flashlight would be a good idea if you expect to linger after sunset.The town of Moab is fairly compact, so you don't really have to stay close to the entrance to Arches. Though, we did stay at the Holiday Inn Express, which is about 3 minutes from the entrance. This made it really easy to pop back for a shower, before heading off again for an evening visit.","September 10, 2015",A must see,25,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5

Many of the formations and arches are immediately off the roadside with easy parking for photo ops but Landscape Arch requires a hike of about a mile. More of a walk really. We did it in jeans and boots because we were on a motorcycle (btw THE recommended way to tour this park) and we managed the terrain just fine. It's sandy so don't even bother with a stroller and no dogs are allowed unless they're service animals, of course. The walk is in and out of shade so you can rest if need be. And just ask people coming back how far you have to go before you give up. There's a watering station at the entrance to the path but that's it so bring a bottle.

Parking can be challenging but did not seem to be a problem when we were there as most school districts had already started school limiting number of people in the park. Impossible to schedule into the ranger led hike as we were scheduling only two weeks in advance, so we booked with an outside tour company. We were not sorry about this although there was an increased cost as our hiking tour group had 9 people and the ranger group we saw had 40 people.

It was so much fun, there was so much to see, admission is only ten dollars for a week, and there were a variety of hikes good for any age/capability. We were able to do two hikes, a twenty minute hike to the upper deck view of arches which was a bit of a workout, and an easier hike to see the Landscape arch which was my favorite. We went in the afternoon and the Landscape arch trail was all in the shade so that helped a lot. And we were able to see all the main highlights in about three or four hours. There is so much to see even just driving through the park there are lots of cool land formations besides the main arches and things the park is known for.

While the temperature is hot in the summer, usually 100 or so, we caught a cool spell and it was low 90's. Bring plenty of water, especially if you intend to hike a few miles. Honestly, I have been there at all hours of the day and the early morning is the coolest! For some the red rocks get boring after a half day, but for some the uniqueness of the structures, such as the arches and balance rock, etc.. keeps a lot of people curious and wanting more.

Arches National Park,"stayed in moab, utah and went to all of the aches we could view, took a guided tour with a park ranger thru the devils path way ...it was an insight into the work as a team hiking , there are places there that you cannot walk on ..and a few that are narrow places that you need a hand to get thru, there are always idiots going in there and falling in between the rocks, needing to be rescued. stick with the park ranger. along the way i understood the meaning of slick rock, it started to storm out of no where, being under a ledge helped to keep us somewhat drier but, you have to walk thru the wash afterwards , else you disrupt the small creatures that make up the areas protective base of the sand. visiting the triple arch and climbing up was so huge and great ""unimaginable "" pictures. hiking in and up to the delicate arch is a chore.....but, the results are so grand you will spend plenty of time in arches , at least a week or less according to your schedule. be prepared with hiking boots and water , and stamina ..just great scenes where ever you look or hike.i was in arches and moab quite a while ago . but it was just part of a great city to visit , had a room with a kitchen , in moab there is a grocery store , forget the eating out when you can eat when you want and restaurants are a bit remote. but great finds if you are prepared.","September 3, 2015","""awe inspiring and those arches are huge """,13,"Lahti, Finland",5

The park is in a great location, only ten minutes away from the town of Moab. I recommend spending several days here in order to appreciate the beauty of the park and all that it has to offer. Please bring and drink lots of water as it is easy to dehydrated here! This park is one of the most popular with foreigners and families, so I would recommend starting the day as early as possible to avoid the massive crowds. The must do hike is to Delicate Arch which is the best to go at for sunrise! We arrived at 5am in the parking lot and were the first people up there.

Arches National Park,"....in my attempt to describe this fantastic, surreal park. I was fortunate enough to spend two days there, yet found myself wishing I could stay longer. You truly feel as though you are visiting another planet; it wouldn't have surprised me to find out I'd been teleported to Mars, with all the red sand and the amazing, unparalleled rock formations. The trails are laid out very well, and the strategically placed little rock piles called cairns help make sure you stay on course. Delicate Arch, of course, is a must-see, and the way there is a bit challenging, but absolutely worth the effort. Really, my strongest recommendation is that you hike all the trails- make sure you carve out enough time to do that because you will not want to miss any part. Lots of lizards running around, so you're sure to see your share of them- and yes, there are some poisonous snakes, so be mindful, although I never saw any. It's great that you can fill up with all the fresh water you can carry, right at the Visitor's Center, which you will want to do, trust me! I was there at the end of May, which seemed to be an ideal time, as the temperature only was in the mid-to-upper 80s. Also, it's very advantageous to get to the park as early in the morning as you can; I went through the gate before any Park Rangers were there checking people in. The gates remain open, so take advantage, and try to get there early enough so you can catch the Sunrise at one of the many attractions. The location of the park, only a mile above Moab, also is ideal. Even to say I loved every aspect of this place is an understatement; I hope to be back, and soon.","September 1, 2015",Words fail me....,7,"Parkville, Maryland",5

Most pull offs require a very short walk to the best view which is important if you have mobility issues. Many pull offs have restrooms. Roads are in excellent condition and signs are quite adequate. There is no lodge in this park and therefore no restaurant, but signs warn you ahead of time.

Similarly, we hiked a long a wash trail known as ""Park Avenue"", which again gives your great views of dramatic escarpments, rock towers, and sheer canyon walls but is little traveled by other visitors.

Arches National Park,"This is one of those places that are actually so amazing that they are hard to review. So…start at the beginning! If you happen to be a Senior be sure and purchase your National Parks Senior Pass…a lifetime pass for a one time fee of $10! We really recommend that after you enter the park you stop right away at the Visitors Center. They have water spigots outdoors to fill your water bottles (DO NOT GO WITHOUT WATER THIS COULD LEAD TO A MEDICAL EMERGENCY!) and equally importantly spend a few moments watching the very well done documentary on the park. It is a short 15 minutes and my hubby and I both agreed WELL worth your time! Regarding the water, the park does not sell bottled water so either bring your own or buy their empty containers (not cheap) and fill them outdoors at the spigots. There are also nice restrooms here. Then go into the park and come back later to visit the gift shop for more displays and your souvenirs. So…you came here to see some arches? Get ready for a truly unforgettable experience! Take a few moments to look over the map you received upon entering the park. One could certainly see a lot just by driving through the park, and for someone who may have limits on what they can do physically even doing this would be thrilling. For those who can get out and walk, hike, and explore, by all means do so! The road climbing steeply up from the Visitors Center is not at all shy on scenery. Do stop and read the roadside signs as they tell so much about the history and geology of the region. This park offers something for everyone, and I believe no one leaves here without feeling the immenseness and grandeur of what the natural forces of eons before have done to these mountains and canyons of rock. There is much variety in access to the stunning vistas here. You can park and take your camera and get out and walk a short distance, or you can park, take your water, snacks, backpack, walking stick, hat, sunscreen and go for miles and hours. We happened to be there on a day in summer when the temps were between 99 and 104 degrees, not exactly ideal for hiking, but were not about to miss out so off we went. This is wilderness back country. Take with you what you need i.e. first aide kit, LOTS OF WATER etc. I wore long sleeve pants and long sleeve shirt for protection from the sun. As it turned out I would have been cooler in shorts but since I was not sure how much brush was on the trails I opted to stay safe. The canyon walls hold a lot of heat and offer no shade mid day so be prepared! We hiked down Park Avenue and the scenery was incredible! We were surprised at how few people we saw and truly relished the quiet of this sacred spot. We then returned to the car and drove further into the park in search of some of the famous arches. There were more people here probably because it was a much shorter and less steep stroll, but it was breathtaking nonetheless. This is one of those places where you cannot help but think of your mortality when one compares the short span of human lives to the eons it took to form and shape these rocks. We eagerly look forward to visiting this National Park again. The city of Moab, Utah (population 5,000) is close by and offers easy access to this gem of a park. This is red rock scenery at its finest. Do not miss out! Tip for when you visit Arches: There is no food available for purchase so bring it with you! There are several stores in Moab nearby where you can purchase what you need. Bring snacks as well as something substantial. You will wind up staying much longer than you thought and will be hungry from all the hiking if you don't plan ahead! And wear substantial shoes! My husband and I both wore our hiking boots and were so glad we did. If you know you will just stroll a bit maybe casual shoes are fine but if you wish to hike (and who wouldn't?!) the rocks are slippery and the trails steep so come prepared. Tip for while you're in the area: Another really wonderful activity nearby is a jet boat ride down the Colorado! Great fun for all ages and many different trips are available! This is a perfect companion activity to complement Arches National Park as the Colorado skirts the same red rocks yet offers a completely different (and magical!) perspective. We chose the sunset cruise to get good light for photography and also because it wasn't so hot then! We know you will love everything you do here!","August 27, 2015",So inspiring!

The place is magnificent...every way you look is another beautiful vista. The weather cooperated also. Instead of being in the hundreds, it was only in the 90s. My only tip would be to avoid August since the contingent of people from a certain European country take over the park and they are the rudest people on earth. One nearly knocked me down in a store and just kept on walking. I will visit the Eiffel Tower in August since most of the people are here in the US. Lol.Also, don't miss Canyonlands National Park which is nearby and Dead Horse State Park. We also hiked a trail called Negro Bills.

Arches National Park,"While on a whirlwind tour of the national parks of the Southwest, we had enough time to spend a morning (about 4 hours) at Arches National Park. We started our day so early (arriving around 7:15), that the entrance fee booth and the visitor center weren't even open yet. We were travelling on an Annual Pass, so didn't feel guilty for not paying anyway. 4 hours just wasn't enough to enjoy everything we wanted to see! As others have mentioned, this park has a particularly good mix of driving and hiking. And being there in the morning meant we weren't dealing with major crowds. The only disappointment was not having enough time to hike up to Delicate Arch - the viewpoint just doesn't do it justice, and is itself quite a strenuous climb. We also weren't able to make it up to Devil's Garden, and therefore didn't see Landscape Arch either. If you go, don't make the same mistake I did - plan to spend a full day, especially if you enjoy hikes in the 0.5-3 mile range.","August 25, 2015",Great views!,74,"Fenton, Missouri",4

The girls participated in the Junior Ranger program and earned their badge. Dead Horse State Park also participates in the Junior Ranger program and isn't far away. The rocks are amazing. The park can be done in a day, picking and choosing which trails to do depending on age of children or excitement level of teenage girls.","August 20, 2015",LOVED!!!,5,"Fayetteville, Arkansas",5

Arches National Park,Arches is on of the most beautiful and interesting of the national parks. The red rock jutting up out of the high desert floor is phenomenal. You can hike to dozens of rock formations and arches. The access road offers magnificent views for miles and is well worth it even for those who cannot or choose not to hike. Hiking and off-roading offer even more opportunities for discovery.This park is a photographer's dream.,"August 15, 2015",Over two thousand stone arches,100,"Lebanon, CT",5
Arches National Park,"Be prepared to be amazed when you take In the vistas of this magnificent park. There is truly no way to do it justice with words. The colors and rock formations are the works of nature over millions of years. It is easy to get a sense of perspective on one's own importance when in this place!!! I drove from Grand Junction, CO and have to caution any traveler to be sure you have a full tank of gas and water on hand when you set out. There are no services (until you reach Moab) and the area is quite remote. The drive was well worth it and I would definitely make the trip again. Allow a full day to enjoy the park in its entirety.","April 4, 2015","Breathtaking works of art, created by Mother Nature",0,Hammond,4
Arches National Park,"We spent today driving through the Arches and Needles/Canyonland Park near Moab, Utah. Most awesome sights you will ever see, the rocks that were formed million years ago is too difficult to describe. It's one of those saying ""you have to be there"".We were unable to hike, so missed some of the views. The roads are fine and today not too much traffic.Stayed at Comfort INn Suites which was great.Lots of good places to eat.","September 5, 2014",Don't miss Utah Parks,10,Colorado,5
Arches National Park,"Arches national park is a must see. It is beautiful. We drove the entire park, stopping several times to see the unique arches up close. There are several easy hikes that take you up close for a better view. The park is just outside of Moab, so very easy drive.","June 24, 2014",beautiful....must see,30,Michigan,5
Arches National Park,"I visited Arches Nat. Park in late October 2013, and I was floored by its natural beauty! It was one spectacular sight after another! I only had 4 hours to spend here, and it was not nearly enough. I suppose if you only wish to stay in your vehicle and view the formations from afar, then a few hours is sufficient, but this amazing place is best enjoyed when you take the time to walk, getting up close to these gigantic geological relics! The hikes are mostly quite easy, although a few may be strenuous to some. Even though you’d appreciate this place any time of the year, I’d suggest avoiding the heat of summertime or at least bring plenty of water with you if you do visit in June through August where the temperatures easily top 100° F. I am definitely coming here again!","November 17, 2013",An Absolute MUST-SEE on Any Trip Through the West!,254,"Phoenix, Arizona",5
