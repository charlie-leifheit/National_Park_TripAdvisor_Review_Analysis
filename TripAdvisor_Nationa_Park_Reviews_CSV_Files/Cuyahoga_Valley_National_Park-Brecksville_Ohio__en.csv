Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We only had a few hours in the afternoon to check out this park. We stopped at several of the must see items that were on the map and had a great time. We saw so many places where it would have been nice to have our bikes, or rent bikes, but we did not have the time. It is very different from other parks in that you drive in and out of the park and there are a lot of private homes interspersed along the way. The only drawback is the major highways that cross the park and disturb the quiet. Very beautiful.","October 10, 2019",Wish we had our bikes!,57,New york,5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We started out on a Sunday drive for Peninsula Ohio, in our convertible. With all the detours and road construction we ended up in the beautiful National Park. We were not sorry at all. Lots of activities for families. Many bicyclists enjoying a Sunday ride on wonderful bike paths. Lots of walkers and hikers also. A must see treasure. And Pumpkins for sale everywhere.","October 3, 2019",What a beautiful day!,14,"Elyria, Ohio",5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"I have wanted to visit this park for many months. Finally, we reached the road to the park to discover it is in terrible condition. We are traveling in a 25 foot motor home. There is no parking for RVs on this day because the lot was just paved and no one can use it. The brief stop I had in the visitor center was not inspiring enough to make me ever want to return. If you want to be a National Park, you need the infrastructure to support the travelers wanting to visit. There is no RV camping either.","September 28, 2019",Don’t Go Here Unless You Are Desperate For Something to Do,98,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",2
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We couldn't make room in our schedule for a full day visit, so we opted for the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad tour. It was a warm, sunny day, and watching all those people walking and biking on the marvelous trail system made me want to get off and join them. This is not a grand scenery-and-wildlife park like the iconic parks of the western U.S., but Cuyahoga Valley NP has natural and cultural attractions and activities aplenty and is a prime example of the urban-oriented, readily accessible parks emerging from the ""bring the parks to the people"" initiative of the 1970s. No admission fee is charged; what a bargain!","September 25, 2019","Readily accessible, and no admission fee",738,"Columbia, South Carolina",5
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We are from Pittsburgh and were in town for a concert at Blossom. We had all day Saturday to hang out and I checked on the park. What a great day we had. Waterfalls and hiking through the trails, all the views very nice park. Had a picnic lunch there and ended up being a great day. We attend concerts at Blossom as much as we can as love the venue and Cleveland. Yes as rivals from the Burgh we are fans of Cleveland too!","September 20, 2019",What a find,29,"North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania",5
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"You can hike or bike along the Cuyahoga River and Ohio and Erie Canal. When the train is running, you don't have to walk (or bike) out and back to your car. Instead you can take the train one way (it will carry bikes) and then hike or bike back. Or if you tried too ambitious a distance, you can have the train take you the rest of the way.","September 18, 2019",Two great NPS visitor centers with many hiking and biking trails nearby.,183,"Park Ridge, Illinois",5
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"My co-worker and I had to travel to Cleveland for some training. We were able to get a late enough flight back home so that we could get out early and explore this park. We took the trail around the gorge to see Brandywine Falls which worked out really well with some nice views of the river. Also, took the side trail up the hill to see the canal after which we doubled back to catch the pond and loop around the other side of the gorge taking the bridge just above the falls. All in all we spent a few hours here, got the blood pumping for a brisk hike, and got to experience some beautiful scenery here before returning to the airport to catch our flight.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,The park is beautiful with 125 miles of trails and a biking path that goes on for miles. There are several falls to hike to also.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We stopped here on our way home after a week-long vacation throughout Ohio. There is no fee to enter the ""national park."" There is a very small visitors' center. The bathrooms near the visitors' center had a water filling station, which can come in quite handy. We were unimpressed and underwhelmed. This place reminded us more of a state park. We enjoyed our short hike to Brandywine Falls and the Ledges. There was a very helpful female ranger near the area of the Ledges that gave us information on a good path to walk.","September 16, 2019",just OK,78,"Shorewood, Illinois",3
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"The only reason we stopped at this National Park is because we want to see all the National Parks, and to get the Passport series stamps. We stopped at the Boston Store Visitor Center, it was minimally interesting. The Park is nice, and the river is pretty, but not stunningly so. Lots of good walking and biking options along the towpath. It’s worthwhile that the Park Service is preserving this area, but as others have said, this is more like a State Park. It’s questionable why it was ever designated a National Park. Probably great area for locals, but I would not go back.","September 9, 2019",Nice recreational opportunities but underwhelming National Park,70,Minneapolis MN,3
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"This is the newest of the National Parks. My husband and I love visiting the national park system and found this one rather unique.

Also, if you are interested in trains, this park is for you!","September 9, 2019",A wonderful slice of history,17,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States",4
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We enjoyed biking along the towpath and the train ride back was convenient. We really appreciated the towpath safety volunteers - my wife twisted her foot and they were there with an ice pack and wrap. So overall we had a good time.I was not all that impressed though with the canal or scenery. I grew up near the D&H in New York - so whoopy, a ditch. The scenery was typical boring overgrown bottom land. I guess I have been spoiled by other parks such as Acadia and Theodore Roosevelt. I get the feeling this place became a national park because someone with “pull” in Ohio had a friend in Washington who was willing to throw the state a bone. As a national park - pretty underwhelming. ","September 5, 2019",A National Park?,18,"Painesville, Ohio",3

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"hard to believe this place is just south of Cleveland, OH. Did some biking and hiking on the trails. In particular there is a paved bike trail which runs along the river for about 20 miles. Word to the wise if you are bringing young children, use caution as some of the hiking trails are rugged with ledges and steep drop offs.","September 3, 2019",A natural gem!,0,,5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We love visiting national parks, and combining a weekend trip to Cleveland with a visit here seemed like a good idea. On the plus side it is very close to Cleveland and so does not entail all the hours of driving it takes to get to most National parks. On the minus side it was too urban for our taste, driving around in the park is not really scenic, just any road in the midwest with houses etc along the road. We hiked Brandywine falls and the Ledges and enjoyed both. Certainly not my favorite NP but definitely a worthwhile day trip if you are in Cleveland.","August 30, 2019",Beautiful waterfall,56,"Saint Louis, Missouri",4
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We spent 1.5 days here in August. We visited Brandywine Falls, Beaver Marsh, and the Ledges and rode rental bikes out of Peninsula on the tow path trail. The rangers were very helpful, park maps were easy to use and roads easy to navigate. We also went to the covered bridge in Everett. The park is lovely and was a treat to visit, just remember you are between Cleveland and Akron and don’t expect the complete silence and solitude available in the Badlands. Met lots of interesting people too. Recommend! A big note: the trains don’t run on Monday and Tuesday and that’s when we were at the park!","August 25, 2019",Urban-ish National Park,23,"Richmond, Virginia",5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Spend a couple of days in the park hiking and biking. What a lovely place. Trails are nice and provide a wide variety of terrain, views and interesting geological formations. Well worth a visit if in the area.

We rode our bikes on the Towpath trail in Cuyahoga Valley National Park, hiked the Brandywine Falls and Ledges paths and finished up with a nice bike ride on the Holmes County Trail from Millersburg. One quick suggestion for the Towpath trail. We parked and rode our bikes from Rockside Station to Peninsula. Then we took the train back ($5 each). We did not realize that we rode UP HILL the entire way. If we do it again, we will start bike riding in Peninsula.","August 20, 2019",Nice bike paths and hiking,10,"Adrian, Michigan, United States",5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We went to Cuyahoga mainly for hiking and general outdoor activities. We needed not too long and technical hiking trails, since we are a couple with a 35 pounds toddler on my back almost all the time, so the park was perfect! Well signalized, the main attractions are not so far away from boston and peninsula downtown! We were really glad to go there. In peninsula there are a few restaurants that you can stop by to have nice meals between an attraction and other!

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"This was a pretty place but feel it is more like a state park. Trying to visit as many national parks as possible so glad we went. Just don’t expect to be overwhelmed as you usually are at a national park. One strange thing—the park is scattered in some areas through homes and little towns so you drive in and out of park. Start at Boston Mill Visitor Center in Peninsula. They have a short historical video. Be sure to get a map from them. It had the main attractions and their address that will work in your gps. That is the only way you can find things as they are spread out like a maze. The big thing seems to be to bike along the canal towpath. You can rent bikes in the area. We visited Brandywine falls, blue hen falls, bridal falls and the ledges. Several hiking trails. Also you can horseback ride there. Good history of the role of the canal and towpath. Several restaurants at Rockside station and near peninsula station. Hotels in Cuyahoga falls and a couple inns in the park.","August 4, 2019",Not your usual national park,35,"Whitesburg, Kentucky",4
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Before going please realize this is an urban park, it is not like Yosemite, Yellowstone or the Grand Canyon and no one has ever claimed that it is. It runs between the cities of Cleveland and Akron, so there are highways running nearby and some residential buildings as well. Small farms within the park have been preserved and at the rate things are going they may be the last small farms left in America soon. The whole idea of this park is that it is an urban park aimed to preserve land near two large urban centers for the enjoyment of the public. I was involved when this park was created and I love it because of what is and what it does for the public - it preserves the history and the original landscape of northeast Ohio. Not many urban areas have this.The highlight of the park is the 85-mile Towpath Trail which runs along with the remnants of the Ohio and Erie Canal. You can see some of the locks that once raised and lowered the boats that traveled on the canal. There are two visitor centers, the Canal Visitor's Center and the Boston Store Visitor's Center with displays on canal history. In the village of Penninsula, there is a gift shop. The town is a restored early 19th-century village and is quite charming. You can rent a bike to ride on the towpath trail n Penninsula. There are also hiking trails within the park and the info on them can be found at the visitor centers. An online calendar, found on the park's website, will tell you about all of the activities planned during your visit. There are many ranger-led activities and a farmer's market during the summer. Be advised the park is very busy on the weekends and it is best to go during the week.Please visit and enjoy the park for what it is, a respite from the nearby urban world.","August 3, 2019",Beautiful urban park,21,"Columbus, Ohio",5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,We were in the area and have a love of National Parks so decided to visit this one. It’s not your usual NP but does have some nice walks and features. Not being from the area we headed for the Visitors Center which is a must if you are out of town. Roy the volunteer organized our route with maps and guides. It’s a good thing he did as it is not an easy place to get around. Going from the Falls to the Ledges was interesting as you would drive into the park then out again in an urban setting past private houses and than back into the park.Both places we visited were very pretty nice quiet and peaceful. We picked a day that was not too hot so walked the tail to the Ledges overlook. The path to the Waterfall is a boardwalk so easy to traverse.A nice park for the locals.,"July 18, 2019",Unusual in its urban setting,237,Florida,3
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Definitely not national park caliber. Should be a metro park or state park at best. Not even on par with Hocking Hills State Park southeast of Columbus.If you’re expecting a typical national park experience, this isn’t your park. The interstates are always within earshot and often visible. The trails are nice enough but pretty much just typical wooded trails with a couple of relatively small waterfalls (yes, that includes the “iconic” Brandywine Falls). Worth a stop if you’re in Cleveland. But definitely don’t make a special trip to see this place.","July 15, 2019",Not National Park Status,7,"Boulder, Colorado",2

Loved it and the weather was perfect. ,"July 7, 2019",Very scenic,69,"Tampa, Florida",5
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,Our group went there to bike. We biked north from the Boston Visitor Center to the first train stop. We then took the train north to the last stop. The train ride is only $5.00 and was a plus for the trip and this includes taking your bike onboard. Very pleasant and the conductor walked through all dressed in uniform. Nice touch. We also went to see the Brandy Wine Falls. Lots of steps but worth the walk. We did have some trouble catching the train. It was confusing which side to be on and the signage could be improved. Overall we enjoyed. We stayed a Holiday Inn Express nearby.,"July 2, 2019",Biking,2,"Clinton Township, Michigan",4
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"I was traveling across the country and thought I'd check this place out. It may have been great but I'll never know because they could not be bothered to put a sign saying where to exit. The park is right off a major freeway according to my map, but no sign at the exit?? By the time I figured out that I had passed it, it was too late to go back. I have been all over the country and every other state or national park has a sign, usually brown, directing cars to the entrance.

The trail is well maintained crushed lime stone. It follows the river, the former toll path. We saw an eagle (beautiful) And lots of water fowl. Before going to this Park we wondered why it would be designated a national Park, but having visited weare pleased with that decision. In addition there are trails in the area for hiking around lakes, a Heron rookery, and more. Had a terrific Italian meal at Giuseppe’s family owned Italian ristorante in nearby Northfield.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"After hiking the 3 most popular trails, Brandywine Falls, Ledges trail, and the blue hen and buttermilk falls trail, I was very disappointed. From both the Brandywine and blue hen falls trails all you can hear the whole time is the highway and cars zipping by. You can literally see the road from brandywine falls. Driving in between these sites doesn’t even feel like a National Park but instead more like a crawling urban setting. The ledges trail was nice but nothing spectacular, and the “famous” view was just a view of the highway. Do not go out of your way to visit this park unless you will be in the Cleveland area. If you are looking for a better nature spot go south to the Hocking Hills region which has caves/cliffs/falls that can at least rival out west. I must ask who in the U.S. Congress got paid under the table for this to become a park? This is a joke to all other real National Parks and this would be a state park at best, but really only a metro park.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"I had a four-day weekend and my husband decided to explore this area and see and do what we could. It was early in May when the weather is unpredictable, so we had already decided to stay in a motel rather than tent camping. That was a good choice since it rained all day Friday, our travel day. Saturday was incredibly foggy and even misty to start and end, but the rain didn't divert us. We visited Brandywine Falls and then hiked the gorge trail, taking our time, since the rocks were slick. We were amazed at the informational signs and well-maintained trail. Then we we to see the Blue Herons on their nests, which led us to the nearby Nature Realm--both were fascinating and well done. The Nature Realm was especially great for kids. The next day we rode the train via their bike and ride. A $5 ticket allowed us to get on at the north end of the route and ride the train for an hour--seeing an eagles nest and listening to some folks who do that often. We disembarked at Indigo Lake and spent till 5 p.m. biking the 20(?) miles back to our car. Our first opportunity to bike this year, and what a beautiful day for this sort of thing. Many other people on the trail hiking and biking. We had taken lunch food so we didn't have interrupt our exploration to find a restaurant. We topped off our lunch at the Boston Trail Mix Store in Boston with a couple of cups of homemade ice cream. Delicious! Finished the day by driving to Blue Hen Falls, which was lovely--a steep descent and return climb, but it was worth it. We plan to finish our visit by spending some at the Ledges.

We got a bit turned around as the map given out was confusing. The waterfall at Brandywine Falls was neat. It was pretty busy with other tourists.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Reading the TripAdvisor reviews, I was a little concerned when reviewers voiced their opinions that CVNP didn't deserve to be included as a National Park. Sure it's a little broken up due to the fact that it's in the city but it is beautiful and I imagine with time it will get even better. My favorite place was the Ledges, followed closely by Brandywine Falls. There are lots of other things to do including The Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad and the Towpath Trail, which follows the route of the Ohio Erie Canal. As of now there are only five primitive campsites available but we stayed at Punderson State park in our camper vans and that was very nice.","November 28, 2018",Proud to Have This National Park In My Backyard,146,"Willoughby, Ohio",4

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Its value is definitely its proximity to multiple local cities/suburbs, meaning if you spend the day in the park you can easily get back to your hotel or Cleveland without much hassle. Most of it seems like the canal pathway, so good if you were going on a long run or bike ride. Otherwise a lot of the trails for 'hiking' seemed paved. We enjoyed the brief one associated with the waterfall and associated river. Easy parking in the area and for those who don't want to bike for miles you can practically drive along much of it if you wish. Nice place to visit and worth coming back to many times if you lived in the area, otherwise once is probably enough.","November 25, 2018","Excellent park, not bad hiking",196,Virginia,5
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We started at the Visitor Center, where the staff kindly suggested two hikes and marked them on a map. We saw Brandywine Falls in the morning. Be careful if it is below freezing... we found lots of slippery spots.. but the handrails helped and the trail is well kept.  After a picnic lunch we hiked the Ledges trail and were equally delighted at how well maintained the trail is and how beautiful the views are. (Too bad the most beautiful view was marred by an inconsiderate smoker who fouled the fresh forest air! Manners!) We recommend this for all agile people.. but do wear the right footwear, and keep a tight hold of little ones’ hands and use the handrails when they’re there.  In warmer weather this would be an ideal stop along the bike path.  Always impressed with our National Parks, we would return to this one for sure!

Being so close to a metropolitan area you never had the sense of getting away. There was always the sound of interstate traffic throughout the park. Also the park is fragmented and a bit difficult to navigate. I’m not sure how this area got National Park status but to us it felt like walking in the woods of our local state parks . The waterfalls might have been more impressive during a wetter time, but not so much on this visit.

The info/displays on the Erie canal and canal history was good but other than that it was a disappointment. Visitor center is very small. Brandywine Falls is kind of small and unappealing. The Ledges Trail was nice, but one of the worst marked trails I've been on. It's an oval trail with several cross trails and it;s easy to get lost on even with a trail map.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Cuyahoga Valley National Park -It's got what you're looking for! 1. Are you a Rail Fan or into trains? Take the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad - they offer different programs throughout the year - $15 coach ride is reasonable.2. Do you like history and museums - Visit the Hale Farm and Village - a historical interpretative site with costumed re-enactors depicting 19th century farm life.3. You like nature? There are several waterfalls scattered throughout the park - we saw Brandywine Falls - definitely worth it and not too strenuous. There is also the Beaver Marsh where you might see beavers, herons, muskrat - we saw a couple of painted turtles sunbathing as it was hot in the day.4. You like hiking? - tons of trails of different levels - include the Ledges trail which has interesting giant rocks that you can walk in between - Keep in mind though, you may need to get dirty to go under or between rock areas. I'm a big guy, had to get on my hands and knees a bit, but it was fun.5. You like cycling? - you can rent bikes and bike the flat Towpath that goes for about 110 miles (26 or so are in the park)6. Horseback riding? - there are trails to do it on.7. Kayaking? Yup, it's available.8. plenty of farms to buy produce or fall items.The park has a nice feel to it. You can go in and out of the park by to get to different destinations which is a plus for guys like me that don't want endless hiking to get from spot to spot.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Of the 20+ national parks I've visited, Cuyahoga Valley is by far the worst. It's a collection of metro parks and offers nothing unique that would define it as a NP. (1) The waterfalls are below average as they look man made. (2) The hikes are normal wooded hiking trails you can see in any state park. (3) There are no gift shops in or around the park, so forget about that collectible. (4) there are too many urban/populated areas between each of the so called attraction areas, hence the old metro parks.

We didn't take the train but would have if we had more time. The other must see is The Ledges which is a gorgeous geological formation. If its your first time there (it was ours) I would suggest you visit the Boston Store Visitor Center first and you can get lots of info on what to see and how to get there. They have some great volunteers working throughout the park and the NP staff were excellent sources of information. There are roads going every direction and you're always passing through some kind of residential area to get to the next thing you want to see. So get some maps and info.Another great thing, its free. The railroad costs $'s. A point of advice I could offer the NP service. They need better parking at some sites.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,The Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area is one of the best reasons to live in Northeast Ohio. There are a lot of activities to keep you busy four seasons of the year it's a great escape and the sites Trails wildlife and history of the area is truly a rich and rewarding experience. It's hard to even start but I'll start with the ski areas even though I don't ski anymore there are two of them very close together and if I'm ever able to again I will definitely utilize them. Boston Mills and Brandywine are very nice winter escapes and I use them a lot when I was still able to. Boston Mills actually has a very fine art festival in the summer. there's a beautiful waterfall called Brandywine Falls as well as blue hen Falls which are very close to one another and both worth the trip. Brandywine Falls is a 65-foot waterfall that has been utilized in the past fine Electric Company and has a very rich history itself and blue hen Falls is a smaller Falls real close to Boston Mills Ski Area that if not visited in the same day are worth the trip for two different hikes. The bike trail that runs through the valley goes all the way from the Akron area all the way to Cleveland I believe and it's just got such beautiful sites especially the swampy area just south of peninsula which goes over a pond where you can see all types of wildlife including very large snapping turtles and of course the Blue Heron nesting area is definitely worth visiting early in the summer to see the large birds nesting. blue herons can be seen throughout Northeast Ohio but especially in the valley. if you get a chance to canoe or kayak in the valley just a beautiful experience. There are so many trails in addition to the Summit County and Cuyahoga County Metroparks that you could do a different Trail every couple of days through the whole warmer season and still not go through the all. The Visitor Center on Route 303 in the Boston Heights Peninsula area has got activities as well. Hale farm and Village sets in the valley which is a very nice historic Homestead from the Hale family from Connecticut where they have actors buildings Craftsman including candle makers and a working blacksmith shop where the characters act as though they're from the 1840s and do not break character very entertaining and educational. there's a train that runs through the valley all the way up to the Cleveland area where you can see such beautiful sites pretty much year-round and including the fall Foliage. You also have different concerts within the valley that are free throughout the warmer weather. Blossom Music Center which is separate but is at the top of the valley has all kinds of national Acts from symphonies to Country to rock and all forms of music during the warm weather that creates wonderful memories. There's also an outside play venue from one of the local colleges on site at Blossom as well. There's also a working farm that grows corn and other things in the valley called Szalays that has got all types of vegetables some of the best corn in Ohio and one of the best corn mazes in the fall they're open all the way through the end of October. there are so many things to do that it's hard to name them all but well worth checking out.,"August 27, 2018",Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area Northeast Ohio.,4,"Akron, Ohio",5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Though this is no where near the spectacular spectacle many of the western national parks, this park has some unique features and merits that makes this park just as worthy of your visit. We approached our tour from the south to the north. Due to the spread-out nature of the park and the intermingling of towns and homes, there is no way they could manage entry fees. We entered from W Bath road coming in from the town of Cuyahoga Falls. Riverview Drive was the main vein from which most of our stops came from.

Brandywine Falls is easily accessible, there is a path right next to the parking lot and it has amazing views of the 65 foot fall. The Ledges Trail is also easily reachable and it's about two miles total. It goes through beautiful rocks which are easy to climb on and to take fun pictures with your friends. Other than that you can go biking along the river or take scenic Cuyohoga valley train. These are OK options but nothing special in my opinion.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"I wanted to love this place, and while researching I really thought I would. I'll be up front and state that I wasn't able to spend the time I wanted to here, but the bits I visited, felt just ordinary and perhaps its because I've visited so many other national parks that are bigger and better, I was left disappointed. We happened to be in Cleveland stopping through on our way somewhere else, and I made a point to my group that I wanted to spend some time here. We did, and walked a couple trails, I ran the more popular edges trail, and while nice, was just a bit underwhelming. I might be too hard on the place, and didn't even get to visit the Brandywine falls, so I'm hesitant to put my stamp on the place fully yet. Perhaps if I was able to zero in on some of the better locations it would be different, but I guess I was expecting more. I might have been a bit jaded by the fact that this park is intermingled with interstates, towns, roads ,stop signs, houses, and the like which probably did take away from the more normal isolated national park feel. I can't say don't go, but I can't say go if you are not in Cleveland already though.","July 30, 2018","Wanted to like this a lot more, but maybe I need to try it again?",71,"Springville, Indiana",3

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"There is no entrance fee for this national park. The road into the visitor's center is somewhat narrow & curvy - we probably felt this more as we were driving a U-haul. We were worried about parking with our large vehicle, but there is RV parking just a short walk past the visitor's center. The center was small with just a small amount of information, but the building was fun to see. Restrooms were located in a separate building & were clean. The various hikes are all spread out around the park. We didn't have much time, so we did Brandywine Falls, which is quite short. There was a sufficient amount of parking. There was a wooden walkway with stairs down to the viewing platform. (I believe there is an accessible viewing platform elsewhere) There are restrooms located at the start of the walk.","July 19, 2018",Free National Park!,59,,4

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Having lived in Ohio my entire life, I thought it was time to check out Ohio’s only National Park. I think this is one of the newer National Parks in the country as well having been declared as one in 2000. The park is beautiful, but a bit different than most – lots of areas with homes, and commercialization in the area. That being said, the trails are great. Ample parking at all of the locations we visited as well. I was a bit confused on how to pay the fee or toll as there are no pay booths that we saw, but we did have an annual pass anyway.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We made camping reservations for two nights; my boyfriend and his son went the first night and I joined them the morning of the second day. First the good: the falls and trails were beautiful, and would be easily accessible for most people. The trails and campsites are well maintained, the visitors center employees are fantastic, and there are some organized activities if you enjoy that. I would highly recommend day trips to this national park. Now for the bad: there were ticks EVERYWHERE. Not that this is anyone’s fault, of course, just be aware, especially if you are camping with kids. After picking something in the neighborhood of 20-25 ticks off our tent and finding several on the picnic table, we decided not to stay the second night. That’s nothing against the park, it’s simply a bad tick season. The second “bad” item was when I arrived I was setting up my tent and my chihuaha somehow slipped out of his collar/leash. This is 100% my responsibility. I immediately called his name and a passing hiker said, he’s right here. I ran to grab him as the joker was petting him. The entire transaction was about a minute long at most and everything was fine. There happened to be a park ranger passing by who witnessed the event. He definitely was within his rights to tell me my dog needed to be on a leash. I apologized and explained what happened and turned to go back to the campsite a few feet away to reattach the collar. The park ranger proceeded to loudly scold me with hikers passing by. He then stopped me on my way to grab the leash to say, “I need you to get that leash on NOW.” I want my pup on his leash too as he’s a small dog and could get hurt, so I’m not arguing, but his tone and attitude were well beyond what was necessary. He then stated he was not sure if I was within regulations having a dog at the campsite. I told him the website and reservation service both stated dogs were allowed and I even had to list that I was bringing a dog when I reserved the site online. He said, “I’m going to check into that. I’ll be back if you could just stay right here.” What bothered me the most is his tone and demeanor suggested I was doing something wrong, and he was throwing his weight around but didn’t even know the rules of the park. It turned out fine as dogs ARE allowed but the interaction left a bad taste in my mouth.","July 7, 2018",Really love the park but....,1,,3

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We made this girl’s trip because my mom (88) wanted to see it. Concerned about the length and difficulty of the sights, we stopped in at the welcome center at the north end of the park. This clean building houses the story of the canal, the locks, history and visual aids to explain the area’s history. Very helpful park personnel took her time to point out every point of interest to us and was able to give us details regarding each spot we wanted to visit, where to eat, shop, park, everything. She even was focused on us when the phone rang a few times. (If you call and they don’t pick up, they may be helping someone, leave a voicemail, your call will be returned). I might add, just for fun, pick up a National Park Passport and earn your stamps during this visit. Nine to be exact. Our adventure started by visiting the falls just outside the National Park. We doubled back and drove the main road down to Penisula for lunch. This is a cute little town. The railroad goes right thru it, there is a cycle shop to buy or rent your bikes or shop at a few of the cute shops.  After lunch we searched out the remaining falls. Now, I’m a Michigander and we have and I have travelled and viewed a lot of falls, gorges, formations, etc. these are not spectacular falls however, as a whole, I think it’s worth a trip. This is why: the area is pretty, the people are nice, the National Park is VERY clean and well kept. The trails are nice trails. They are wide, well maintained and safe. Day two we boarded the train at Rockside. We purchased our tickets on line and was not an issue at all. We opted for the dome seats. I thought this might be on the lame side but I sucked it up. I was pleasantly surprised. It was actually pretty cool. The train was long with an engine at each end. It was clean and well maintained with countless volunteers to answer your questions (see review). After our ride we headed to the trail mix stores. There are two, both have snacks, souvenirs and a park stamp. Visited the south welcome center, again, clean and helpful people waiting to help. We finished at the Beaver Marsh. This is an area to view birds, fowl, critters and maybe an otter. Take your camera and be patient. To wrap up, the Park is worth a visit. If you are a family, there is enough to do to keep everyone happy for a day or two. The park had a lot of people enjoying it. More cyclists, joggers and health goers than kids. The bike paths and towpaths are really nice and with the train, cyclists were really enjoying their rides. There are restrooms all over. Go and enjoy this park, it’s free! Oh!

On the trail we met other volunteers who were very informative about the wildlife in the area. We walked from Boston to Peninsula – easy walking through different habitats – prairie, riparian, wetlands and woodland. There are also interesting industrial archaeological remains from the time when the canal was functioning. We also visited the Brandywine falls – picturesque falls with well situated walks and overlooks. On the second day we went to the canal exploration centre where there are excellent displays explaining the history of the canal along with interesting artefacts.

We are on a quest to see all the national parks and had put this one aside. It doesn't have the grandeur of the western parks but it is beautiful and fun in its own way. There are lots of waterfalls to visit with easy walks. The towpath is flat and paved. What more can you ask for. You can walk different sections or bike. There is a bike rental near the Boston Store Visitor Center. We stayed in Stow and went in to the park on 2 days. We hiked the Station Road hike. It is flat, easy and on the towpath along the water. Saw a heron. We did the beaver marsh area. At the Ira trailhead turn left toward Everett. There is a boardwalk. Didn't see any beavers. Lots of birds and wildflowers. Again, easy walking on the towpath. We also walked a trail to India Lake and Hale Farm. Not on the towpath but an pretty easy trail. Pretty little lake. Lots of birds and wildflowers.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"This park is not crowded and easily accessible. We were staying in Cleveland and any part of the park was like 30 mins away. Also accessible since we could get in and out of the park, get some lunch and go back in to do more hikes. The CYNP is very convenient and under rated. I did a bit of research before we went to the park and most people said that its more like a metro-park or a state-park and there wasn't anything to do. I disagree, its a great park for a weekend getaway and not crowded like other NPs.Recommended trails:-Brandywine falls: not much of a hike, you park and just walk down to see the falls- Blue Hen falls: Its beautiful and not many people so its peaceful too. We went on a long hike here and did part of the Buckeye trail. The trail was mucky but not too bad but Do Not forget to carry bug spray, you will thank me later :)- Ledges: This was highly rated on the All trails app (great free app to explore trails around any park). This part of the park felt like Antelope Canyon but with rocks and stones. The formation was beautiful and kept us cool and safe from the harsh afternoon sun. We did the Octagon and Pine Hollow trails here- Bridal Veil Falls: Wasn't great at all, you can give it a miss. It doesn't need to be hiked too so its not much of a strain, can park and walk to the falls.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Our family has used the CVNP for hiking, biking, and horseback riding for many years. The Towpath Trail that runs through part of the park is great for biking and taking the CV Scenic Train with the Bike Aboard program that runs each season. We enjoy parking in different lots each time to explore different sections of the trail. The Beaver Marsh area is one of our favorites, though we also spot wildlife all throughout the trail (great blue herons, tri-colored heron, turtles galore sunning themselves, etc). The Boston Store is a favorite spot on a hot day to stop for a quick break in the air conditioned building and play a quick game of checkers while cooling down. We have ridden horses on the designated bridle trails, which have lots of hills and beautiful areas to explore. Brandywine Falls is a beautiful area to take in, and we have enjoyed stays at Brandywine Falls Bed and Breakfast. Deep Lock Quarry is a short, enjoyable trail to hike. A stop in the Winking Lizard Restaurant in Peninsula is always a treat after a bike ride - great food, reasonable prices. We are grateful to have this park close by to make use of all year.

The park lands are checkerboarded into town and suburbia, so one drives from park to town and back to park. Nonetheless, it is worth a visit: start with the visitor's center and canal and then go to the falls and then see the covered bridge. A short visit can be made in about two hours.

It was cold and raining on the day my family visited, so we went to the visitor's center to learn a little bit of the history, watched a short documentary, and spoke with the park rangers. We saw a portion of the canal and Towpath Trail, the running/bike path that runs alongside the Ohio River/Erie Canal, and then we drove to Brandywine Falls. This waterfall is reminiscent of Bridal Veil Falls in Yosemite in regards to the enormous amount of water rushing from the top. Absolutely beautiful! I wish I could say more about the park, but that's all I was able to see in the short time we were there.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"This was a half-day stop on our road trip, and we're definitely planning on returning!The Canal Exploration Center was, unfortunately, closed for the season, but some friendly fellow travelers told us we could still take a look at the canal lock. It is the only operational lock on what used to be the Ohio-Erie Canal, and we stood on the banks contemplating how a boat might have come into the lock, bump! and waited for the water to be lowered or raised (the Beaver Marsh lock explanation has a fun quote from John Quincy Adams about the experience as a passenger).Of all the waterfalls, our favorite was hands-down the Bridal Veil. I've never seen a stream with a sandstone/shale bed before, and it was absolutely mesmerizing to look at the shallow, clear water sweeping over the layers and layers of shale. We enjoyed the walk to Blue Hen (definitely park in the ""Overflow"" parking area--the ""actual"" parking area had three spots, ha!) and Brandywine was the biggest, but Bridal Veil felt serene and very special.The short film at the Boston Mills visitor center was informative and explained a bit about how we could see a whole road's worth of private homes inside the national park itself. The rangers were friendly and helpful (the Cuyahoga Valley NP stamp is on the 2000 sheet. I totally missed their helpful sign and dug my way back...). You can leave post-it suggestions and feedback for their new visitor center and T-shirt, which is pretty cool. We wished the oral history segments of the boat yard display were working, though that's just one more reason to come back!The Nature Center was a quiet spot when we visited. It's a great spot for families, with offerings such as a few scheduled programs (a ranger was showing two children how to tie useful knots when we were there), live animals (an Eastern box turtle and a ratsnake, not to mention the bird-feeder crowd outside), and a comfy nook with picture books, puppets, and puzzles. Also, don't miss out on Beaver Marsh. Even though we weren't expecting much on a March afternoon, we still got to see a great blue heron go about its patient business of catching things to eat, not to mention some Canada geese. The boardwalk was well-placed, and we felt very much at peace strolling over the water. Overall, the park felt like a little gem, with some GORGE-ous views, pretty waterfalls, and great history, even in late winter/early spring.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"In my attempt to visit all the national parks, my daughter and I headed up to Cuyahoga Valley last fall. This was our 12th park, and it is unique in that it is surrounded by a large urban area, some of which is actually inside the park. There were some beautiful areas, but at no time did I actually feel like I was in a national park. Almost everywhere we were, we could hear traffic noise from the interstate -- when you are at the visitor center, you can look up and see a highway bridge high above you. Roads from the surrounding towns crisscross the park, and there are many private homes inside the park boundary. The park is newer within the park system, and one of the rangers explained that as private property owners pass on, their property will be sold to the park service, so years down the road, I imagine that the park will look a bit different -- but I don't see any getting away from the traffic noise. I feel like this park is probably well-used by people who live nearby rather than being a destination park (like Zion, for example). There are lots of bike trails, so if that is something you enjoy, you would likely get a very different perspective on the park.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"A buddy and myself drove over to Cuyahoga Valley National Park a few weeks back for some hiking. We went on a Saturday and it was still pretty warm, about 75 degrees. I was a little disappointed that the fall colors hadn't really taken hold yet, but this was the weekend we made the plans, so bad luck. Other than the lack of fall colors, the park was excellent. It was pretty busy and most of the lots that we parked in close to trailheads were about full. The trails were not super busy once people spread out a bit. We hiked Ledges, Brandywine Gorge and the Towpath in a couple different areas. In all, about 7 miles total. Ledges is a must do and Brandywine was great with the falls, which were pretty slow from the lack of rain the week or so before we went.We also stopped by the Boston Store Visitor Center and did a little shopping. There are a few more trails that I want to do on a future visit and maybe even do the CVNP Railroad, which we saw a few times. The park also has some great driving roads, small towns that looked really interesting and then all sorts of things like farms, concert venues, skiing and a golf course that we didn't do. As with most National Parks, you could spend 3-4 days and never see the same thing twice.","November 2, 2017",Had a Fantastic Day Hiking,283,Indiana,5
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Lots to do in the Nat'l park in Ohio. Extensive biking trail all along the canal/river path. Train access for those only wanting to do a one-way bike/walk so you can get back to the parking lot of your choice. Quaint depot stops along the way like Boston Mill, Pennsula, Botzum.. I think I'd access bike path at Boston Mill and ride down to Botzum....maybe 15-miles or so and then hop on train with my bike to return. The American Scenic By-way goes all along this canal/river path for a lovely drive between Cleveland and Akron. Also along the way are Blossem Music Venue, Hale Farms and Stan Hywet Mansion and Gardens. Easy access at the north to Rockside Road hotels or maybe a few Inns in the park itself like Inn at Brandywine Falls....right at the falls would be great for overnite stay so as to take it all in!","October 23, 2017",Great National Park right in our Ohio backyard,206,"Granville, Ohio",5
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,Plenty of great hiking trails. We had young kids so biking wasn’t an option but a bike is by far the best way to see the park. The towpath trail runs right up the center of the park and there are several other trails that go out to areas of the park not right along the Cuyahoga River. Driving by car requires going in and out of neighborhoods near the park so it is a much different experience than most national parks,"October 21, 2017",Lots of great hiking opportunities,25,,5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"I've been to many stunning National Parks in the US, as well as amazing destinations all over the world. Cuyahoga Valley NP is beautiful in its own way and worth a visit. You can enjoy it in 3 hours or 3 days and anything in between. I did just a 3 hour visit on my most recent trip and I loved it. I rented a bike in Peninsula, hopped on the train (only $3 for cyclists!), got off, and enjoyed solitude on the trails. I stopped for an Italian ice at Trail Mix, and continued back to Peninsula. I saw wildlife like chipmunks, turtles, and heron. The train is scenic, though I can only speak for a portion of the route that I was on. Sit on the river side of the train! Don't expect it to be high speed; I think it moves around 30 MPH. After that, I went to Brandywine Falls. Parking is available close to the falls. The walk is less than 0.5 miles, with the option of stairs or a ramp. I went on a weekday during the afternoon and I highly recommend it if you want to avoid the crowds. Every person I met was incredibly nice - not just polite but went out of their way to help me - from the bike rental shop, to the train assistants, to the shopkeeper. If you like trains, biking, hiking, neat bridges, and/or Ohio countryside, I think you'll love the park. The park was very clean and there are bathrooms and water fountains at the train stations. The towpath trail is a little narrow in places and has light gravel, so research that if it impacts your biking plans. I went at a leisurely pace.","October 15, 2017",quaintly Ohio!,52,"Stuttgart, Germany",5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"The Cuyahoga Valley National Park is a narrow Park and generally follows the Cuyahoga River between Akron, OH and Cleveland, OH. This Park is about 9 miles north of Akron and about 20 miles south of Cleveland. I visited this park to explore it on a bicycle as there are 5 bike trails in it. In my opinion, the main trail is the Ohio & Erie Towpath Trail that follows the old and historic Ohio & Erie Canal. There is no fee to enter this National Park which is unusual as almost every other National Parks charges an entrance fee.I visited this Park with my wife on a Tuesday afternoon in mid-August and really enjoyed it. We visited on a weekday and it was not very crowded but I learned from a Park Ranger that this park is VERY busy on the weekends. We rented bikes in Peninsula, Ohio and then road an hour north on the Towpath Trail before resting a while and then riding back. I enjoyed the bike ride and also enjoyed stopping to look at the old canal locks that are still standing (I can’t believe they survived).Overall I think this is a great Park close to Cleveland (where I was staying) and I really enjoyed exploring it on a bicycle.

The road went in and out of the park a lot, which is probably why there is no admission fee. But we were glad that we were in the area and enjoyed our quick visit. We only spent about half a day in the park, stopping at the Canal and Boston Store visitors centers, and in between stopping for a couple short hikes (along the canal towpath and to Brandywine Falls). The scenery here is not as impressive as other National Parks that we've visited, so I don't think this is one to go out of your way to visit, but if you're nearby, or live in the area, it was a nice spot with some good trails.","October 3, 2017",Small park but a nice stop,396,"Portland, Oregon",3

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"My husband and I love visiting National Parks - and Cuyahoga was definitely a surprise! Cleveland is absolutely wonderful - and to have this park right outside is just a gem. Great hiking and biking trails with a nice variance on scenery. We hiked from the Boston Mills Visitor Center to Brandywine Falls - mostly deciduous trees. Lovely lookout to Brandywine Falls with plenty of photo ops. Later hiked around Ledges - this had lots of stacked rock formations and evergreen trees. Ice Box Cave is closed on this trail due to white-nose disease for the bats, but this trail is still worth it even without being able to go into the cave. Would have loved to spend more time hiking around in this park as we only had a day and didn't even go to the north side of the park, but based on what we did see I would still call it awesome.I see some other reviews that don't find this really worthy of a National Park, but I would say that it doesn't have to be magnanimous to still be worthy!","October 1, 2017",Great park in the state of Ohio,16,"Lewisville, Texas",5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"As national parks go, this has to be considered a minor park - but we enjoyed our visit. We were there on a Monday in September so the canal center was closed. I understand the economics of that decision - there is no entrance fee here - but it was a disappointment.We took 3 short hikes, in 3 different sections of the park. I really wished we had bicycles with us as the canal path was well maintained and looked like good riding. We saw one of the waterfalls, hiked in the ""ledges"" area, and walked on the towpath to the beaver marsh (which could use some better signage from the parking lot).We did not see beaver, but we did see a heron, a snake, a turtle, and a ... catfish, maybe?There were plenty of out of state cars in the parking lot, so the park does get some visitors, but it seemed like perhaps much of the use - particularly on the canal path - comes from locals.If I lived here, I'd be one of those frequent patrons.There's plenty of hiking and what looks like some good bicycling, but not too much else to do here, particularly if the canal center is closed and the nearby train isn't running.

Lots of miles of well groomed bike/hike trails that appear to be mostly flat but we didn't have bikes and only had 1 day to spend. Unfortunately, we were there on a Mon., and THE TRAIN DOESN'T RUN ON MONDAYS. All 3 of the little falls were pretty in spite of not much water flow at the time. We liked Bridal Veil Falls best but we were told it's actually in the Cleveland Parkway system.We were glad we stopped at the little Canal Exploration Center to get some history of the OHIO-ERIE CANAL.

Far, far away from Ohio these days and on to a new set of paths, I still find myself reminiscing about the valley and the woods around it. It is an incredibly beautiful place to be. Cleveland is proud of this national park jewel (particularly the role the river played in triggering the environmental protection act) and rightly so.

It is a great trail for all ages as it is flat. We parked at Canal Exploration Center and rode south to the Botzum train station. There are locks along the way and some history signs to read. Towards Botzum there is a great swamp area where we saw lots of fish, snapping turtles, and birds that seemed to be posing for pictures. The train ride for a bike rider was only $3! We wished we still had young children because this would have been fun for them to ride on their bikes and then take the train. We only hiked a couple of trails but I highly recommend the Ledges trail. You can actually walk in rock formations that are 20-30 feet high as you look up.The whole trail is 2.2 miles that is rated moderate.

I've been going to Cleveland for close to 40 years and I had never visited until now. The park features a 20-mile towpath trail that follows the Ohio and Erie canals which is great for biking or walking. We had brought bikes with us so, after having lunch on the patio of Foster's, a pub in the cute little town, we biked from Peninsula to the Canal Visitor's Center which was about 10-miles. It was a flat, comfortable trail with lots to see along the way including herons and a small furry animal which I couldn't identify. There were two museums that we stopped at along the trail, one in Boston focused on the boats that plied the canal, and the second at the visitor's center explored the canals in general. Both were definitely worth a stop. A passenger train runs along the path and because we were short on time and the timing was right we took it on the way back from the visitor's center to where we parked our cars in Peninsula. It was fun--volunteers are dressed as conductors and they take your fare which is just a couple of dollars--while other staff load your bikes. I would love to explore this park more the next time I'm in Cleveland since we only did a portion of the trail and there are lots of hiking trails as well.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"If what springs to mind when you hear “Cuyahoga River” are the images from 1969 when the highly polluted waterway actually burned, the long, narrow Cuyahoga Valley National Park will be a more than pleasant surprise. Not only did the infamous fire prompt environmental legislation that led to a desperately needed clean-up of rivers nationwide, it got some folks thinking about the positive aspects of the river and the beauty of the valley through which it flows. Once nearly barren of fish and wildlife, it’s now a thriving habitat. I’m told the word Cuyahoga comes from a Mohawk Indian word for “crooked,” and this river does indeed twist and turn repeatedly on its 85-mile journey, first southward, then north, eventually emptying into Lake Erie in Cleveland. When the Indians lived here, an eight-mile portage from the Cuyahoga to the Tuscarawas River enabled access to the Ohio, then to the Mississippi and all the way down to the Gulf of Mexico.As Europeans settled the area, the Cuyahoga become the waterway that enabled construction of the Ohio and Erie Canal between industrial Cleveland and tire-manufacturing mecca Akron. The meticulously maintained canal towpath is now a centerpiece of the park’s offerings, well traveled by walkers and bicyclists.Also nestled in the valley is a historic train line, which runs the length of the park. From the train, you can not only appreciate the surrounding woodlands and adjacent villages, so removed from urban bustle, but you also may view wildlife. Passengers on our trip saw hawks, a young eagle, turtles, deer, and the tourists swarming the bicycle rental shop in the tiny town of Peninsula.The Park has nearly 125 miles of trails of varying degrees of difficulty for hikers, skiers, and horseback riders, camping options (we stayed at a ritzy B&B), canoeing, kayaking, and fishing. We visited a huge marsh created when beavers were introduced into an area that was the former site of an auto salvage lot. A green heron visited when we did.Villages incorporated in the park harbor interesting features: a covered bridge, huge farmer’s market, canal locks, a ski resort, golfing, nature education centers, and the famous Blossom Music Center concert venue. So near to major cities, on weekdays at least, it’s a true getaway for all seasons.","July 13, 2017",A National Park you may not have heard of--and it's great!,17,"Princeton, New Jersey",4
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"This is a beautiful National Park sprawling alongside the Cuyahoga River and Erie Canal with a great towpath for cycling/walking or distance running. The towpath runs from Cleveland to Akron with so many areas in between to stop and explore all of the parks nooks and crannies and also a few little visitor centers in different areas. The Cuyahoga Valley Railroad also runs the distance of the park with the main station being in Peninsula Ohio, a pretty little town with a couple of good casual restaurants. My husband and I have visited many national parks in the U.S. and have met people who have gone out of their way to come to Cuyahoga Nat'l Park just to ride the train or bike on the towpath.....have said there's no other towpath in the country they have enjoyed more!

We spent several days and covered the entire park. Highlights were the Ledges, Brandywine Falls and Beaver Marsh as well as some of the ""off the beaten path"" waterfalls. One of the best things about this park is that you are never too far off in the wilderness so worrying about finding food, lodging and gas are not things you have to worry about as we had to while filming in other parks.","July 8, 2017",One of the easiest National Parks to Explore,5,Ohio,5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Wife and I didn't even realize that this National Park existed in Ohio. Obviously doesn't get the public advertising like the bigger Parks, but it certainly a place to visit if you are in the northern ohio area. The park is very well integrated into the local communities because the towns and cities grew up near the Rivers and Canals that encompass the park. Is the only park that has a Train that traverses the length of the park and is something that we would to ride on our next visit. Bikers love the park because of paths, numerous towns for stops and they use of the trains to get to different bike paths. Wife and I did the Brandywine Falls and Ledges hiking paths. They are rated moderate with many families with small kids able to traverse them. One of the better looking falls we have seen in a while. Paths are marked but we have seen paths that have more signs but we found our way. They have a Canal Museum with tours which we didn't get to visit on this trip.

The signage was less than adequate to direct us to those beautiful areas that we apparently missed. After going to national parks such as the Great Smoky Mountains, etc. this seemed underwhelming. We did stop at the train maintenance depot by mistake where the kind employees gave us a schedule of the excursion and where to actually board it. Sadly, the train was on its last run.

We then drove around the park and saw the blossom music centre, the historical village and some of the old canal. The next day we saw the bridle veil falls, which were very beautiful. We were sad we didn't have enough time to bike the towpath trail, but maybe it's an excuse to comeback. My only complaint for not making it a 5/5 was that there are huge turnpikes and highways running through the park. The sound of traffic doesn't make it as relaxing as the park could be without them.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"The towpath is a gravel trail following the remnants of a canal. That means its a path following a stagnate pool of water that is a breeding ground for mosquitos and many other flying insects. Bug spray helps but its still hard to not inhale a fewThe parking is ridiculous. if you are not one of the first few people there you are relegated to overflow parking. This is basically just a grass field. If not blocked in by all the creative parking, there is a good chance you will get stuck in the mud. They might as well turn this area into a trailer park with all the motohomes/campers that get stuck in there.The best part of this park is that Akron uses the Cuyahoga river to dump their raw sewage.

Walk the 1.75 mile trail around this stunning geological wonder. The trail is not suitable for wheelchair or stroller but once those kiddies are mobile the trails are a challenge they will love...just make sure they are old enough to perceive dangers and stay on the trails. The Ledges are appropriately named! For locals, the shelter is a great place to rent for family get together. The main shelter is perfect for year round gatherings with two wood burning fireplaces. The building itself is constructed and paneled with wormy chestnut which gives it a rich and warm look.If it's raining just wear good rain gear.

We visited in a Tuesday (in March) so most of the centers were closed. We started north and visited the Scenic Railroad Trains run weekends only, but there was a nice footbridge that lead to the Towpath Trail. We stopped at the Canal Exploration Center, which we knew would be closed, but we lucked out because there was a school field trip and the rangers invited us to stay. We got to see a demonstration of the lock, which was really cool! The rangers also let us look around the center for a few minutes and the kids loved it. We visited the Boston Store Visitor Center which is open year-round. The kids got their Junior Ranger badges. Once of the activities is a scenery tour, which is basically a self-guided walking tour that we really enjoyed. The canal is now woodland and wetland in this area, which was cool to see. Blue Hen Falls was nice if a bit muddy, but the kids enjoyed climbing down to the bottom of the falls. The Peninsula Depot has a nice gift shop (much bigger than the one at Boston Store. Visitor Center) and is part of he historic area in the town (this part is actually not a section of the National Park, but is situated in the middle of park area).Our last stop was the Beaver Marsh. We walked about half a mile from the parking area to the lookout, which was worth it. The old canal was flooded by beaver damns and is a great marsh area.

Stop and eat lunch in Peninsula before taking off on your bike ride.* Drive back into Peninsula in your car and visit any of the cute restaurants. There is an ice cream shop and also great shops and galleries.Day Two- The next day, take your car to Bridal Veil Falls, Brandywine Falls, and hike around the area. Then you can visit the Blue Hen Falls and the Everett Covered Bridge. Do some hiking this time on the tow path. *In the winter you could ride on the train one day and visit Peninsula. The next day you could go tubing or skiing at Boston Mills or Brandywine Ski Resorts.You can also see the Brandywine Falls in the winter and take a winter hike.We stayed at the SpringHill Suites in Independence , Ohio and thought it was wonderful.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"My 11 year old granddaughter and myself have been visiting as many of the National Parks as we can with my parks pass this year. We took a trip to Utah and did the grand circle plus some extra parks such as Mesa Verde and The Grand Canyon.We live in Pittsburgh so we were excited there was a National Park only 2 hours drive away. So we finally went this past weekend since the leaves were turning and thought it would be a nice little day trip.As mentioned by others the park is free. We stopped at the visitor's center first to get the cancellation stamp for our National Parks Passport books. They actually had 5 stamps so if you have a book don't forget it! The visitor's center was really small with a few small exhibits that took about all of 5 minutes to see.The park has a lot of nice bike trails, we plan on coming again in the summer and bring our bikes. Lots of people were biking. The trail along the old tow path is paved and level so great for kids and beginners.We went to Brandywine falls. What was weird is we had to take a road that went out of the park. Then another back into the park. Also we thought it was odd that there were actual residential homes inside the park.Brandywine falls was nice, but there was a road right over top of it that pretty much ruined the view. Not sure whose bright idea that was. Trying to get a nice picture without the concrete slab from the bridge was a small challenge.We also did the Ledges trail, along with some of the ones that connected to it. We walked around 3.5 miles through the woods according to my Fitbit. The only thing that was annoying as heck was even though you were in these nice beautiful woods every few minutes you could hear an extremely loud motorcycle or truck etc. You really didn't get the peaceful away from the city experience that you do at a normal National Park.Overall the park was nice but it just didn't feel like you were in a National Park. Maybe we were spoiled after seeing Zion, Bryce, Arches, Canyonlands, Grand Canyon etc. Cuyahoga while very nice felt more like a state park than a National Park. I have been to some National Monuments that were much more impressive than Cuyahoga.Don't misunderstand, we both liked the park a lot, and if you have never been to some of the Utah National Parks or California Parks you will love it.

Trails were well marked and cared for. Good for families and even those that don't hike much. The Ledges actually had an easy groomed trail and you could if you wanted, walk around and through a lot of rock formations. Definitely want to go back and explore more trails. Family friendly and dog friendly. No charge to access. Make sure you use the restrooms at the trail heads before you start. You might not have additional opportunities on the trail.","October 14, 2016","Easy hikes, nice scenery",77,"Houston, Tx",5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"My son and his family visited this park for a week earlier in the month and raved about it. What is unusual about this National Park is that is ideal for anything like a short (half hour or so) scenic rest stop right off the highway to a week long family vacation. Checking our map it was an easy stop to make on our drive between Chicago and Pittsburgh just minutes off I 80 which runs right through it. We were only there for about an hour and a half and hiked the ridge trail to the beautiful Brandywine Falls. My sons family biked the towpath, took the train ride along the canal, along with hiking several trails.","October 6, 2016",very nice lesser known national park,155,"orland park, il.",5

The trail has a very gentle slope, through verdant forests. I encountered many deer along the trail and ducks and herons in the canal. The train parallels a portion of the trail which is on the opposite shore of the Cuyahoga River. Very pretty views of the river and a must do as an easy bike ride. The towpath trail is used by many folks. From marathon runners, bikers, to folks enjoying a peaceful walk. ","October 5, 2016",Bike ride on Ohio Erie Canal Towpath Trail,87,"Hockessin, Delaware",4

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We biked from the Boston visitor center to the North Akron train station. And enjoyed the relative ease of the ride on crushed stone and enjoyed the pictorial historical markers that tell the story of the Towpath Trail. It was quiet and uncrowded on the weekday. After rain for the last 6 miles, we opted to return by train; one can take their bike for just $3. We also enjoyed Brandywine Falls which can be reached by car or by bike on the county park trail, just outside Cuyahoga NP. The rangers at the Boston Visitor Center were helpful to us in planning our bike trips. Some small wildlife and of course trees and plants add to its beauty and provide cover from rain and sun for the biking. A portion of the park was converted from a scrap yard and now serves as a beaver marsh; the park service has built a deck walk/bikeway across the marsh. This to us was an admirable project. And that is true of the entire park, as a spot of the natural environment covers the area between two industrial areas.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"On our visit to CV National Park, we drove down to the Botzum parking lot, by the train station early on a Saturday morning in Sept, rode our bikes 20+ miles on the Towpath Trail to the Rockside station on a very nice (hard packed stone, occasionally blacktop surface- would not recommend rode bikes) for about 2 hours, then hopped on the CV train for $ 3 to take us back to our car. If you hike, bike or run the Towpath trail the train for you is only $3! The train ride took a bit over an hour, we relaxed, got a beer on board and really enjoyed the scenery. The east side of the train definitely will have a better view as you follow the water on that side, rather than just views of trees. Just so you know, the regular riders on the train, in all the front cars have really cold air conditioned cars, so if you get hot during the ride like I did, just take a walk to one of those cars as the car in the back for the bikers was hot on our Sept day. ON the Towpath trail itself, we saw bluebird, turtles, heron, beaver damns, even a small snake yikes, and some cute towns that we would have stopped in if we weren't in a hurry to complete our journey as we did not want to miss the train ride back. When boarding the train as a biker, you don't pay your fare until onboard the train, and you get on the train at the corner of the Rockside parking lot nearest to the train tracks, you will see a sign there for ""bike aboard"", so don't sit in the train station with the regular riders. If you want to take a more relaxed route, you might want to ride the train first, then bike back, so you don't have to worry about missing your train. The second day in the park we hiked to the Beaver Marsh (where a National Park employee will explain what you see there) Brandywine Falls, Blue Hen Falls, Oak Hill hiking (which was the only really quiet place we explored, and much enjoyed) and the highlight was the ""Ledges area"", really awesome hike, but many stairs. Everett Road has a nice covered bridge. Riverview Rd was quite busy with traffic on our day, and the parking lots at some stops were almost full so we picked the more popular stops to do first (Ledges). No, this isn't like your typical park out west, but for anyone in the Midwest or East this is surely worth the drive in IF you like to bike, hike or even jog. Would be an excellent marathon training run, and you will see plenty others to inspire you along. We got lucky enough to see a visiting steam engine as well this weekend, train lovers paradise.","September 27, 2016",Athlete and outdoor adventurers must do this!

The bike trail is a combination of gravel and paved asphalt with numerous places to stop and explore. There are key visitors centers at Boston Mills and The Canal Exploration Center. I recommend going to the visitor center first. We also visited Brandywine Falls which is very nice. The whole park is very historic with much to learn about the Ohio and Erie Canal.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We’ve visited several national parks (and most of the biggest ones) and we were pleasantly surprised with this park as we made a stop on our trip to Pittsburgh. Living in the Chicago area, this is the closest national park to us. This park has an unique history and there are some towns that are actually within the park area itself. It’s also nice to know that if you check out Beaver Marsh and take the guided hike with the park ranger, you’ll see how the area has really improved and how wildlife has come back to the area. There are also some other parks within the property that are not run by the park service but still are worth checking out. There is no admission fee to the park as well. This is a very good park if you are into hiking or biking. I also saw it was ranked one of the best parks in the country for fall foliage. If you have younger kids however, you’ll probably only need a couple of days to see what you need to. Probably our favorite stop was the Brandywine Falls. Our experience with the train wasn’t good (separate review posted) but it’s probably one of the most popular things to do in the park. Other nice places to quickly check out is the Everett Covered Bridge.The only other comment I wanted to add is compared to the other parks I’ve been to, the overall signage is definitely lacking to the more popular sites. Fortunately (or unfortunately depending on your point of view), since this park is in an urban area you will get good cell coverage so you can use GPS to find your way, unlike in other remote location parks.","September 11, 2016",A nice overall park,55,"Arlington Heights, Illinois",4

Such a place is the Virginia Kendall park where an ornate Octogan shelter is located and the Ledges hiking trail is across from it!! This AREA is A MUST SEE IF YOUR COMING TO THE CUY VALLEY NATIONAL PARK!! The other mini parks are cool-yes but The V. KENDALL park is the cool one!! Fetch a nicely printed color map at the trail head in the little boxes and enjoy how we educate nature lovers in Ohio!! Nicely illustrated!Sadly the Ice box cave back in the heart of the Ledges teail is closed for the time being to restore the Bat habit inside but my fond memories of going INSIDE as a teen still bring me smiles. Id still feel free to explore the cool mini cave and openings all around because theyre everywhere. The rock formations covered in green moss are picturesque so THIS IS CAMERA TERITORY if your looking for good shots!! The trails are only moderate in difficulty and worth dbling back to hang out in the rock formations. There are some great mini bridges and rock steps worth photographing. Bring a picnic lunch and stuff to do (ie. Football, frisbee, kites) out in the massive open finely kept grassy area cause its huuuuge!! Permanent restroom and picnic table shelters are right there w water fountains. Plus A short drive away is the waterfalls at Brandywine., make sure to hike way down into the lower ravine there-way cool stuff!! Then hit Szalays market for true farm food.

The waterfall does look more impressive in the spring due to stronger water flow, opposed to times in the summer when it has not been raining for period of time.My biggest complain about the park is that it does not offer any camping options which I believe they are in the process of adding this into the park but will not be finished until 2020.","August 11, 2016",Ohio's national park,2,"Canal Fulton, Ohio",3

I have read reviews in which folks are comparing it to Yellowstone, Yosemite, Glacier, and so on. That is definitely comparing apples with oranges. If you compare, then I think you will be disappointed. We didn't visit with that perspective. We wanted to accept it for what it is. I think it is a lovely park in a lovely town. We did not hike to any waterfalls. We rode 20 miles on a bike trail, and we liked it very much. It was pretty and scenic. The visitor's center was charming as was the little shop across the street.

There are nice bike and walking trails and signs for horse back riding trails. Some of the trails are under the interstate, so we were a little surprised at the noise. We thought it would be nice to rent some horses to go trail riding, but when I asked about horse rental, I was told you have to bring your own horse. Disappointment. Our nearby state parks in Indiana have more trails and some have horseback riding close by. We also had missed our turn on a trail because of the trail marker being a little confusing. The waterfall is beautiful and the steps and paths are well maintained, the staff is friendly and helpful, but the park was just not quite what I had in mind.","August 2, 2016","Not Quite What I Had In Mind, But Nice",75,"Indianapolis, Indiana",3

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"This is one of the smaller (~35,000 acres; compared to say Yellowstone at 2.2 million acres) and newer, (established in 2000) of the national parks, yet its a beautiful environment, fully meeting all the criteria of a national park. Because of its smaller size, it easily explorable in a day or less. We were lucky enough to explore it by motorcycle, so if you are riding along the Ohio Turnpike in NE Ohio, its easily accessible (and highly recommended) from there. The turnpike passes right through (more like ""over"" it). Get off Ohio turnpike at exit 180 and you are literally minute away. Its worth a few hours to cruise through this beautiful area. The park largely follows along the Cuyahoga river from NE Cleveland then south to the Akron area, and it's also easily accessible from other highways at either end. You can cruise ""riverside drive"" virtually the entire length, and explore sidings from there as time permits. No entrance fee (like many national parks) makes this an easy choice for an enjoyable few hours or a day. There are many trails for walking or bicycling along winding rolling hills, and riverside and canal paths. There are also more rugged areas to explore and many cliffs and ledges, and a few nice waterfalls (Brandywine Falls and Blue Hen Falls), both just a short walk from convenient (and free) parking! Don't expect to see bison or bears, but other wildlife is abundant.","July 28, 2016","A National Park just outside Cleveland OH! A Motorcycle ride ""must""",33,,5
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,We spent the day driving to and walking the paths around Brandywine Falls and the ledges plus having lunch at Peninsula Depot area. The walk to the falls had a board walk with a lot of steps but you could rest of the landings going up. We are seniors and made it with a few rests. I thought the walk to the ledges to be the best part of the day. It was quiet and we were deep in the trees and I felt like it was almost a sacred walk down the incline. It could be a little tricky among the ledges is your footing isn't good but we did fine with it.

There are many options to explore the park and one can choose different routes. The national park community also conducts activities such as "" Treasure Hunt"" to encourage people to explore the different parts of the national park.

We chose to spend most of the day at Hale Farm, which is a little misleading, as it is really the recreation of a village. They also have a visitors center with some very good exhibits and maps, as well as a café for a light lunch. From there, you have a choice of a variety of buildings to go through and many of them have docents in them demonstrating various trades, such as glass blowing, pottery or broom making. You can then tour the village itself and visit what passed as the general store for the village, a house of one of the more wealthy families as well as a church. All the buildings we went into had docents in period dress that gladly answered any questions you would have.

Sites visited included Brandywine Falls, Blue Hen Falls, Beaver Marsh, and the Ledges trail. I liked the wildlife spotting we did at Beaver Marsh and the Ledges trail was also neat to see. We rode the scenic railroad for the experience of it, started at the halfway point in Peninsula and rode to Akron and back. I love the assistance the train gives to bikers/hikers in getting back to their cars, but for site seers it was just a slow ride with several stops and not much more than trees to look at. Some people will board the train elsewhere and ride to Peninsula to shop & eat, in hindsight I think that would have been a better way for us to incorporate the train into our trip. I did not plan to do so originally as I was afraid I would miss out on seeing the sites but the park's natural features do not take that long to see.","July 24, 2016",Day Trip,2,,3

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"My wife and I had a couple of days off around the 4th of July and wanted a quick and easy getaway. My wife wanted to visit a National Park, as it is the centennial of the park system. And Cuyahoga Valley was within a 3 hour drive, so everything lined up and we went.I did a bit of research and found that the park is themed around the Erie and Ohio Canal systems. The old canal towpath has been revamped and is now a multi-use path that runs the length of the park, roughly southern Cleveland to northern Akron. You can walk, run and cycle on the path. It seems to be very popular with cyclists, but we only walked on it during our time there. There is also a scenic railway that runs a round trip the length of the park. We did ride on this and got the superior first class tickets, which are in the upper deck with glass domes above. This provides an excellent view while riding. We rode the railway the first day, and it gave us some ideas about what we wanted to explore the other days we were there. Along the towpath, there are remnants of the old locks used in the canal and those were interesting. There is a Canal Exploration Center in the park that has a canal with the lock doors in place, so you can see what an operational lock looked like back then. The center also has a museum of sorts with some good information about the canal system. The Cuyahoga river also runs the length of the park and you can see it from the railway and towpath a number of places within the park.The park also contains within its borders some other parks. There were some reserves within the Cleveland Metropark system that we visited as well. Overall, it's not what you would likely think of as a national park, in that it is somewhat urban/suburban, there are houses and small towns within its borders, and they also allow you to bring your pets in the park. We saw many dogs while hiking and walking around. There are 2 major highways that cross over the park land, I-271 and The Ohio Turnpike, you don't generally see that in a national park either. However, overall, there is a lot of primarily undeveloped natural land and it is a beautiful area.We like waterfalls, and we visited the Blue Hen, Brandywine, Bridal Veil and Great Falls of Tinker's Creek during our visit. Brandywine is the most popular, and we went there on July 4th, and it was crowded, as was the park in general that day. However, my favorite was the Bridal Veil falls. Those are in the Bedford Reservation, which was one of the Cleveland Metroparks. We went there on the 5th, and we were the only people there.Another surprise to me were The Ledges. It is an area where the glaciers have cut a gorge and the rock formations that are left are giant sections of rock that were broken off the main land mass. The rocks have grooves and smaller rocks embedded into them from the force of the glacier movement. The loop trail is a little over a mile, and well worth it. This was my favorite part of the visit.All in all, a nice park, we will go back, because we liked the natural attractions of the waterfalls, rocks, river, etc. And it's close enough for weekend getaways.","July 10, 2016",Extended holiday weekend visit,25,"Bellbrook, Ohio",4

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"This is a good park, very interesting and informative, and obviously relevant to early transportation for many areas, but don’t expect the same awe factor that you grow to expect from some other National Parks. It’s easily done in a day and it was certainly a good visit and one I recommend, but I felt it was more on the level of a state park than a national park.Boston Store Visitor Center was our first stop inside the park. We got some basic information on the area, watched a short video, collected our Jr. Ranger booklet, and headed out. We first went to the Heronry. We didn’t see any herons, but were able to identify several nests. A short stop.Next came the Beaver Marsh.This trail is along part of the canal system. It can be done on bike, but as our 7 yo pointed out, those people missed a lot. We saw a couple of small turtles and two frogs sunning themselves in the canal. There were a number of butterflies flitting about. Once we reached the marsh, we stayed quiet and saw two large snapping turtles, numerous fish (some pretty large!), and caught a beaver sliding into the water. It was a nice, short walk, easy for kids, and a good return in terms of critter sightings. This and the Canal Visitor Center were our biggest highlights.Next up, the Canal Visitor Center. We planned for our arrival here to coincide with the lock demonstration. The rangers had the kids help open and close the locks, so they got to be involved. They were supposed to be listening to the talk, but they were all very distracted by a large frog stuck between the two locks, and were busy trying not to squash it when they opened and closed the arms. The ranger’s speaker system wasn’t working too well, but we all got most of it. We toured the canal center, which was much more extensive than the Boston Store visitor center. I recommend visits to both though, since they have different information. We were here for about an hour, until close, but we could have stayed about another 30 minutes to finish the exhibits. Then on to Brandywine Falls. The hike from the parking lot to the falls is pretty short. The falls were very pretty and worth the quick visit. Due to the ease of the walk, it’s a pretty busy place, so be prepared for a lot of people.And last came the Ledges. We didn’t have much trouble finding the parking area, but we weren’t sure where to go once we got there. We decided to follow a bunch of other people and ended up in the right spot. From the parking area, you cut across the open field to the upper left corner. Once there, you’ll see trails. Due to a foot injury in our party, we stayed on top of the cliff and didn’t explore any of the lower trails. There were a number of people who had come out to catch the sunset over the valley, probably 30-40, but there was plenty of room for everyone. The sunset did not disappoint! Make sure to have bug spray! Obviously there is plenty more one could do, but we felt we got a pretty decent experience out of one day. (And we even spent a couple of hours at the Hale Farm as well.)

Our first stop was Boston store visitor center to pick up the maps. Park rangers were very friendly and helpful in planning out our day hikes. Here are few hikes worth checking out:1.) Hike to Blue Hen Falls through Buckeye Trail. Trail head is close to the Boston visitor center (you would need to cross the Riverview road on foot and look for a small sign to your left). I would rate this as moderate to difficult hike. We did it in 2 hours. Blue hen fall was Ok but comes out really lovely in pics2.) Brandywine Fall(s): 5 mile hike round trip starts at Stanford house. Follow Stanford trail and loop around the fall on your way back. Hike is mostly flat but goes through woods that protects you from the sunlight and heat. Fall is absolutely gorgeous. Once you are at the lower observation deck, climb over the fence and get down to bottom of the fall. Water is muddy down there but you can take a dip or swim if you like ( 2-3 feet deep).NPS website also recommend Ledges overlook. We went there but did not find anything interesting.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,I'm an avid stamp collector so I had to stop in at the visitor center. This national park would be more suited as a state park due to the urban feel and not much to do. I did not think the beauty of the park was anything special besides the waterfalls. The visitor center itself does a great job curating the special historical attributes and the rangers are very nice and ready to share a plethora of information.

It won't be anything like Yellowstone or the Grand Tetons, so don't expect that. But you can still enjoy a day here. I recommend checking out the Ledges trail. I really enjoyed it.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Cuyahoga Valley isn't a ""national park"" in the way anyone imagines. It isn't going to take your breath away. It probably is on par with your run of the mill state park. If you are ok with that, it is quite enjoyable. Blue Hen falls is nice. Brandywine Falls is very impressive. The Ledges are interesting and the walk from Boston to Peninsula was great along the river, with some history in the old canal. Park staff was quite helpful and with maps and decent signage, we had no navigation issues. Good for a day trip. If you compare it to Yosemite, you will be disappointed.

The towpath is perhaps the most amazing part of this park, its open 24 hours for bikers, hikers and runners. There are tons of beautiful hiking trails all around and ample information and signs to guide you through the park. Ledges trail was amazing and is a must see, not too crazy of a trail so make time for this. Came here during a full moon and there was a moonlight hike lead by the park volunteer rangers. Very beautiful and fun to have gone on a large hike with so many people (40). There are lots of stops to look at throughout the park so I would say at least 2 days to see the highlights. I plan on coming back and renting a bike and riding more of the trail. The people in the town are friendly and so is everyone on the path always with a smile and greeting. I would also recommend that those who like the park and want to stay nearby should look into the Stanford House is a place that you can rent or camp by.

They've recently added a couple of ""real"" mountain bike courses for the real enthusiasts. Each park in the valley has a unique attraction ranging from historical sites to rivers and lakes, to waterfalls, to rocky cliffs, to beautiful views. Most have some trails for walking and hiking as well as picnic areas. Two of the most popular attractions are the towpath and the canal with it's locks (some still working), and the Scenic Railroad which offers many different day trips throughout the year. Winter in the valley is just as fun with things like fantastic sledding hills at Pine Hollow and cross country ski and snow shoe courses at Virginia Kendall. There are many other winter activities and programs as well.

This pond was made by beavers and flooded an auto junkyard. There also the Ohio & Erie Canalway which has a paved towpath that was popular with the bikers. We also rode the train which goes through the park and was beaytiful with the leaves turning. The park doesn't have the spectacular scenery that other National Parks have and it is not that big.

Stop at the visitor center and get some suggestions for hikes since they are a little spread out in different parts of the park. We did two hikes. The first was the Brandywine Falls trail. That was nice. There is supposedly a loop but the bridge across the river is out of commission. We saw some people attempt to cross the stream but the water was a pretty decent current and one woman fell in up to her knees and elbows. We decided not to risk it and we backtracked which was fine. It is a nice hike along the river below the falls. In total we went about 2 miles.The second hike was the Cuyahoga Valley Overlook, which is essentially a 1.8 mile loop with some side options to go see a few more points of interest. Again, it was a pleasant trail with a few ups and downs but nothing too strenuous. We went in the Fall so the tree colors were nice.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"This is the 8th National Park that I have visited as an adult. I will say it is different than those in the west, but nonetheless, beautiful and worth seeing. You have to have a good GPS system and a park map though to navigate. It is in an area that has park and residential areas, but if you have a plan of where you want to go you, it is easy to drive through. We visited Brandywine Falls (very crowded, stairs down to a small viewing area, but a beautiful waterfall), Blue Hen Falls (less crowded, but a smaller fall due to the dry summer, and Great Falls of Tinkers Creek (a very historical place to visit and explore.) Great Falls was not easy to find. You should park at Viaduct Park (you will need to drive over a curb to get onto the driveway but I assure you it does turn into a parking lot) and then walk on the paved path to get down to the falls. Keep going to see the arch up close. These falls were the most impressive. We also walked the Ledges trail which was interesting and easy to hike. The Ice Box cave (bat cave) was closed but you could still explore around it and there was some carved stairs near by that were interesting to see. You can stay on the level path near Ice Box cave, but we climbed some of the rocks and went through some of the gorges. The leaves were just starting to change and it made for beautiful scenery all around the park. There are signs but you really need to know what you are looking for. My three year old had an easy time on all the trails we went on. I think he enjoyed Beaver Marsh the most though. As suggested to us, we went just as it was becoming dark. The geese and the beavers were very active. It was an easy hike to get to the board walk over the marsh from the parking lot. There is also an old lock along the path to the board walk that was interesting to see. We stayed until the sun went down and I wish we would've brought a flash light to get back to the car, but it was a short path so wasn't too bad. We visited the Boston Store Visitor Center and the Peninsula Depot. You need to go to ""Trail Mix"" to get your passport stamp in Peninsula. Both places had bathrooms. Peninsula had food and souvenirs and Boston had limited souvenirs. Boston also had a display about the canal. One final thought, my family and I have a tradition of taking a photo by the ""entrance signs."" We saw two of these signs. Neither have parking near them so we just had to pull off the road and there was no poll to set your camera on (like other parks have had) so we just took separate pictures because we had forgotten the tri-pod.","October 20, 2015","A neat park to visit, but get a map",22,"Joliet, Illinois",5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"There are 3 waterfalls that are only a few min drive or about a 30 min hike away from each other. The bigest one you can drive right up to. There are many trails for cross country or smaller one to two mile loops. It is great for walking and bike riding. It is not over crowded and most of the people are very nice! The only downside is most of the people that work for the park know little about the park and your best bringing your own maps and guides don't expect much help from the staff or the railroad. The railroad is nice but over priced and poorly staffed. If I was rating the railroad I would give 2 stars at best however the park is well worth a trip I travel over 100 miles to visit. There are a few cheep B&B's and inns near some of the main attractions. It is a big park with a lot of history I would suggest making a 2 day trip of it. To sum it up expect to see waterfalls, wild life, old mills, canal locks, high bridges, rivers, large rocks, deep ponds, caves and tunnels. Some of the attractions are Hail Farm a 19th century city, The Railroad, farm markets, winery's, old mills and lots of trails and look out points.","October 15, 2015",Great Park I never knew about right here in Ohio!,16,"Fostoria, Ohio, United States",5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"One has to wonder what kind of pay-off was made to have this area declared a national park. The area is attractive, but the park is small by national park standards (33,000 acres), with lots of private in-holdings, and no particularly striking features. The park seems to be virtually unknown to most people, even a lot of local people. There is no entrance fee to the park and little to see or do. The roads and signs are confusing and the staff, while friendly, are not very clear in their directions. The main ""attraction"" we were pointed to was the Brandywine Falls, which were nice, but no impressive. This would make a nice state park, but seems to have become a national park just to increase the number of national parks in the eastern U.S. In fact, there are many other areas in the east that are more deserving of national park status.Don't get me wrong... you can still enjoy the park very much.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the park, the history, and maps of the area and your visit to the park system will be much more enjoyable. Cuyahoga Valley National Park is an younger national park - established in the 1970s - and used to be called the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area. The park eventually changed its name to avoid confusion with its usage purposes. In reality, yes, it's used more like a recreation area then a traditional national park. National movement to acquire land to protect the Cuyahoga National Valley begun in the 1960's. Individual land donations for a park - not necessarily a national one - had started as early as the 1910's and 1920's. Personally, I have lived in the Cleveland area for most of my life and now moved so that the park system is right down the road from my house. Locals here are no way opposed to the park. We love it. It's located between two major Ohio cities and, yes, the park uses local roads, but that is why it is also fee free. The roads are quite ""country"" so you don't have to worry about rush hour traffic unless you are using freeways. Please stop by one of the visitor centers first and ask for a park map with the suggested trails. If you are looking on getting on the train, you can google ""Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad."" The depot is located right by the Winking Lizard in the center of Peninsula, Ohio. Peninsula is also a great place to start your visit. If you are into history, check out the Erie Canal locks (they have one reconstructed since nearly all were destroyed in a flood in 1913). If looking at waterfalls and hiking is more of your thing, there are several in the area. Personally, my favorite hike is to Blue Hen Falls. Please don't come here with hopes of it being like Yellowstone or the Grand Tetons. ...An extremely suburban and less grandiose version of Zion? Well, that's a little bit more on target. Relax. Hike. Ride the train. Enjoy watching our white tail deer and wild turkeys. I will say they look the plumpest and healthiest of any I've seen in a National Park!

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We drove around the park the day before we road the train and we thought it was all a pretty disorganized affair. I called and asked for an address to one location so we could program a GPS and no one in that office knew the address. We never found information on boarding the train, we just happened to land at the right place. It was always unclear what your could see or do if you exited the train, or how long it would be before the train returned to pick you up. We saw a father and daughter, with bikes, arrive just as the train was pulling away and the father was mad and the daughter started crying. It was hot that day and we think it was 4 hours before the train returned to pick them up. This is a very unusual park in that there are no park roads, all roads are used by the local area as well. No entrance fee because it is impossible to control anything coming or going. Just a suggestion, but a park employee needs to ride with a total stranger and watch them figure out how to navigate that park. No assistance from the park employee, please. It's confusing. Very limited road markings or signs. We were told it was based on the canal and towpath, but we never saw the canal, apparently it doesn't exist anymore. The train was a nice ride but the countryside isn't very appealing and the Cuyahoga River isn't much larger than a trickle and the water is a putrid brown all over. Very disappointing and I've been to 39 national parks and this was a first for me.","September 11, 2015",Not an easy park to understand,26,Osage,2
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"This was a quick stop to break up a long drive on our way through Ohio. The park was very clean and well worth the stop. We stopped by Brandywine Falls and did a little walking along the river. The trail by the river was extremely busy with bikers and joggers, so it was kind of hard to enjoy the scenery, but it was gorgeous nonetheless. The staff was very friendly and introduced us to the Junior Ranger Program. Definitely worth a stop if you are in the area.","September 1, 2015",Great Stop in Ohio,89,"Branchville, New Jersey",3
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"This is a fee free National Park. I am total agreement with many other reviewers... this is a very different National Park! I must note the poor signage when trying to maneuver to different areas within the park. It took us quite some time and more than one visit to the ranger just to find the Ledges due to the very poor road and trail signage. Very uncharacteristic of any National Park I have ever visited. With that said, this National Park has private homes with in the park and unsure if this may be the reason for the poor signage.The Ledges are a beautiful and an interesting place to visit. The Ledges are an amazing feat of Mother Nature comprised of Sharon conglomerate. I even had to learn about the fascinating ""Sharon conglomerate"" from a different source outside of the National Park literature. Brandywine Falls are very pretty. The boardwalk to the falls provides a nice walkway leading to the Falls.We ended our day with a great concert at the Blossom Music Center which is within the National Park. This is an incredible venue that made for a wonderful end to a bit of a disappointing visit to the Cuyahoga Valley National Park.","August 30, 2015",The Ledges and Brandywine Falls are amazing,30,"Hampstead, Maryland",3
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"This park is centered around the Cuyahoga River and is not your average national park.

I expected an amazing view at the overlook but the ledges did not meet our expectations. It is an easy hike. I got to spend some time with friends. It would be a good side trip. The Brandywine Falls is much better than the Ledges. It is a small but beautiful waterfall. It could be that we had lowered our expectations after the seeing the ledges.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"This National Park was a huge disappointment although it does have a few sites worth visiting. The falls and the ledges are nice, the river lovely and there are nice walking paths. On a grand scheme it is small and not embraced as a national park, more like a State Park. The locals are apparently conflicted about giving up their property to make it a National treasure. It has great potential and I am sure the locals really enjoy it.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"If you think of this as a scenic drive (Ohio & Erie Canalway Scenic Byway), you'll be happier with your visit. It's a nice country get-away (I imagine even more so in the fall), but counting it as a national park (which it became only in 2000) is an overstatement.It's confusing to get around. I had printed out a map, but we got way beyond the outskirts and couldn't figure out where we were. Luckily some young park rangers were in the parking lot of Hale Farm (closed when we got there) and they helped us get on our way.The Boston Store info center is helpful, so try to go there first. The train ride sounds like a fun way to get through the park, but unfortunately we were there on a Monday, and it only runs Wednesday through Sunday. We had to work to find the Everett covered bridge (despite having a map). Even though I didn't have high expectations because I read ahead that it had been re-built (lost in a flood), I would say it's not really worth a stop.The little trail to the Brandywine Falls was a relaxing stop. Actually the park is a great place for hiking and biking for all ages, but unfortunately for us we were limited on time. Plenty of places for picnics!The huge rocks at the Ledges were amazing. The ice caves were closed (as noted on the NPS website), but it was still nice walking trail.This is a national park with no entrance fee since there are many roads in and out of it.","August 15, 2015",Scenic drive,173,"Olympia, Washington",3
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We had never seen a National Park like this before, with so many seemingly private homes within its boundaries. The video at the Visitor's Center was very informative about the history of the park, and how the land that comprises it came from quite a few different sources. We didn't have enough time to ride the train, but we were able to take in a few sights like Brandywine Falls and the Beaver Marsh. It was nice to check out, even if it's not the most impressive National Park I've been to.","August 14, 2015",Worth a Visit,70,"Savannah, Georgia",4
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"After reading the article titled “Hidden Valley” about Cuyahoga Valley National Park in the National Parks Conservation Association’s magazine, I just had to visit. With other destinations in the Finger Lakes and Ohio, I planned an 11-day road trip. I drove over 700 miles from home one way to get to this national park. It did not disappoint. The waterfalls, Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath Trail, Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad depicted in photos in the article were represented accurately. The Civilian Conservation Corps created the park one sees today. Its workers built the trails and shelters throughout the park.This park’s path to becoming a National Park began in 1974 when the Cuyahoga River and surrounding land was declared a National Recreational Area by Congress. It officially became a National Park in October 2000 by another Act of Congress.  Throughout the various sections of the sizable park that covers overs over 50 square miles along the Cuyahoga River which runs between Cleveland and Akron, people on bicycles were a very common sight, especially along the former Ohio & Erie Canal Towpath. Parents jogging or walking behind a stroller were another common sight. And, although CVNP is very scenic, it is a place for serious recreation whether it’s bicycling, hiking, walking, or observing nature. Consequently, CVNP is very different from other large national parks, such as the Grand Canyon or Yosemite where one goes to see some type of spectacle as a canyon once in a lifetime. Here, one enjoys the outdoors; hence, locals will tell you that they visit parts of CVNP on nearly a daily basis. It is; therefore, no surprise to hear that this is a very popular national park that receives over 2 million visitors yearly.  There are NO ADMISSION FEES for the park itself. The historic railroad does, of course, charge. The fees vary with what one wants to do ~ just take a short ride and get off with one’s bicycle or take a full four-hour ride. For National Parks travelers participating in the Passport to Your National Parks Program, there are a number of passport cancellation stamps placed at the various visitor centers at the Boston Store Visitor Center and on the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad both in Peninsula, Hunt House Visitor Center in Cuyahoga Falls, and Canal Exploration Center in Valley View.Although the NPS advises visitors to stop first at the Boston Store, the main visitor center, I went to the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad’s Peninsula Depot first to take the 9:40 AM train for the full four-hour ride. Then, I drove to the Boston Store in Peninsula which is the main visitor center to see the 18-minute video “Generations: Cuyahoga Valley National Park” and exhibits about the building of canal boats. From the Boston Store, I headed for the Hunt House. I stopped for a short hike to see Everett Covered Bridge, a 100-foot truss-style bridge was rebuilt in the 1986.  The Towpath Trail passes within 50 feet of the side the Hunt House Visitor Center building so it’s a good stop for families with younger children. There are nature exhibits and activities for children. I finished up with visitor centers at the Canal Exploration Center which is adjacent to Lock #38 on the Towpath Trail.  With 4 hours spent on the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad trip, I had roughly another 3½ hours in this area to get around to the other locations visited. It was a comfortable pace. I didn’t feel rushed. Many parts of this park are wheelchair accessible.I enjoyed my visit to Cuyahoga Valley National Park. I’d like to return. Next time, I’d like to ride a bicycle on the Towpath Trail, see Brandywine Falls and The Ledges, visit Hale Farm & Village, and stay at either Inn at Brandywine Falls or Stanford House.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"My niece discovered this national park during her research for our big summer road trip. I had never heard of this national park and was a bit surprised how close it was to a big urban area like Cleveland. It's a linear park between Cleveland and Akron that appears to preserve the canal history and natural beauty of this area. We only spent a full day in the park, but there is certainly enough to explore to spend two days. We rented bicycles by the hour from Century Bicycles in Peninsula (it's right next to the Towpath Trail). There is 20 miles of the Towpath Trail within the park. We rode the middle 10 miles between Peninsula and the Canal Visitor Center (Hillside Road). The trail is mostly level and tree lined. We saw ducks and a heron on our ride. You can stop for food in Boston or Peninsula. There are lots of short hikes throughout the park, but we only managed to hike to Brandywine Falls (very short, lots of stairs). There were many other trails we wanted to try (The Ledges), but we ran out of time. We would come back to Cuyahoga Valley NP.","August 5, 2015",Not Your Typical National Park,101,"Cumberland, Rhode Island",4
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"This park is spread out but really not very large in comparison to other national parks. It is also surrounded by peoples homes and backyards. We were there for two days and did about everything that the park has to offer, except the train ride, which only runs Wed-Sunday. We biked and hiked to our hearts content. The biking trail is mostly along the river and is an easy bike, being flat. Some of the trails were not very well masked so we just made up our own trail and figured it out. The Falls and the Ledges were pretty sites. If you are into the history of the canal/lock system of that area, this would be a place for you to visit... good exhibits and knowledgeable people on hand. If you lived in the area, this would be a wonderful park to utilize frequently. If you are visiting from afar, it is probably, a one stop kind of park.

That being said we enjoyed the exercise of riding bikes on part of the rails to trails however the views along the way weren't anything too great. I absolutely love how many people seem to utilize the park, lots of families were biking. We planned to hike but unfortunately the train did not stick to the schedule posted! Not knowing how much later than the 40 mins we waited beyond the posted time we opted to ride the bikes back as we wanted to hike. Of course the train showed 5 mins later!

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Ok, it might be a personal thing, but for me, each national park has something that wows me. I didn't find any here. It is a great park, just like some reviewers said, especially for locals. But it probably doesn't make a destination by itself. We took the train ride and visited the Brandywine falls. In both locations, I noticed that there is no running water in any facilities. The restroom on the train can flush, but no water for washing hands. I visited the restroom at the Rockside Train station and at the Brandywine Falls, both are portable potty style, the one at the falls has tons of flies. The train ride itself was very nice, nice trainmen and everything, but the scenery part is not quite there, not much to see. Mostly trees, some wetlands and couple river/canal bends. Kind of interesting to see people's back yard.The Brandywine Falls is very easy to visit, nicely built broad walk, but with stairs. So don't bother with the stroller.","July 24, 2015","Great park, but may not be a great national park",6,"Wilmington, Massachusetts",3
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Being a Clevelander, I had to return to the park system and get together with friends. We drove through the park admiring the beautiful trees and wildflowers. Stopped at Brandywine Falls for a breathtaking view. It was so built up from when they first obtained the land. Many steep wooden stairways to go down and then back up. Those not used to hiking need to stop and catch their breath. Not for a person with disabilities. Saw the bike paths and separate bridges they go under. Truly an asset to the Cleveland area. Familiar smells of the forest came back to me. I always went to my local Metroparks, but now the National Park is new and exciting.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We were taking a car from NYC back to Chicago and made a stop at Cuyahoga National Park.Being Chicagoan with a lack of nearby scenic parks or hiking trails, I can totally see Clevelander or other resident nearby the park rate this a 5 star. If you are avid national parks travelers, this is probably at the bottom of the list. I’ve been to many iconic parks such as Yellow Stone, Glacier, Arch National parks, and I know what to expect in Cuyahoga (which is nearly no expectations), I would rate it 2.5. The directions markings are poor. Nothing much to see besides the Brandywine Falls. The parks has many houses inside, I felt I was crossing someone’s backyard instead of being in a National Park.This will be the perfect park (state park) for weekend biking and hiking with drive less than 1 hr. If you have kids, maybe you can look into the train ride. If you are passing-by the area, stop by the Brandywine Falls and continue on your journey.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We traveled to Cuyahoga from Minnesota with our two boys, ages 9 and 13. As stated by other reviewers, this is a very small national park and doesn't necessarily have the grandeur of, say, Rocky Mountain or Glacier. However, it was ideal with kids or for anyone looking for a pleasant and less extreme hiking experience. There are plenty of half to four mile long loops in the park with waterfalls, boardwalks, wildlife and history. We love hiking as a family, but I believe in the wisdom of scaling our vacation adventures to fit their ages, and this was just right. The park is a little bizarre how it's laid out - felt like we were constantly leaving and re-entering to find new trailheads. From a planning perspective this was maddening. But in execution, it was okay. Again, it gave us a chance to let the kids rest, have a bite to eat and rehydrate while we headed to our next clump of hiking. We especially enjoyed The Ledges and Buttermilk Falls (Ooooh, this is a secret one - start at Blue Hen Falls and hike down stream for about a mile. There are trails, but quite rugged and not marked) and the Beaver Marsh (didn't see any beaver, but giant snapping turtles, and plenty of birds along the boardwalk, plus one of the old canal locks) but every hike we did was enjoyable enough. Some trails were SUPER muddy with all the recent rain, but it made the waterfalls glorious, and Dad wiping out down a slope was sort of a highlight for the kids, ha ha!!! I would have loved to do the bike path if we lived closer and could haul our own, but renting bikes for four people for the day seemed spendy to us. But it looked like an excellent way to experience the park, lovely trail!!! I do wish there had been more lodging/camping available in the park. We ended up staying at the Holiday Inn Express Cleveland-Richefield which was nice and clean, convenient to the park and included free breakfast.","July 18, 2015","Kid size hiking, woo hoo!",7,"Mounds View, Minnesota",4

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Some comments that this park does not have the ""Wow!"" of other parks may be correct. But, understand that some things are worth working for. Frankly, we had never heard of the park and I thought the website was not particularly compelling. My strongest recommendation would be to go to a visitor center and talk with one of the volunteers. The gentleman that aided us was very engaging and full of good recommendations. The story of the canal and the boats is important to our country's history. The Ledges is a truly unique geological area and significant since the glacial periods. Invest some time learning about that before you arrive. The bat cave is quite interesting. Most hikes are reasonable and accessible. They could be better marked though.  They have done a lot of work to get it where it is and have even more areas planned to provide enjoyable family times.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"There is no reason not to say great things about this park. There is a nice waterfall, some pleasant hiking and great cycling. But do NOT except magnificent grandeur here, or you will be profoundly disappointed. In fact, Cuyahoga feels to me like a state park. Cuyahoga became a national park only in 2000, and I suspect there were political reasons for making it so. Many private attractions dot the landscape, from golf clubs to ski resorts, from restaurants to motels. These all were grandfathered in to the national park, formerly a national gateway recreation area. I am glad we went, but do not go here expecting Yellowstone or the Grand Canyon or Acadia or anything remotely close.

I have been to quite a few National Parks, National Historic Sites, etc and this just didn't have a National Park feel. In fact, many of the Cleveland Metroparks feel more like a National Park compared to this. The trails weren't labelled as well as I would have liked. After spending a half an hour on a trail we weren't even sure if it was the one we actually wanted (luckily it was) because there weren't adequate signs. The scenery was just okay.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"As someone who has lived in Ohio for over 50 years, I am amazed that I never knew about this place before. It is huge, beautiful, and full of interesting historical spots to visit.The highlights for me were the Canal Museum and Brandywine Falls. The museum was well interpreted with exhibits that helped one understand what life was like in early Ohio both before and during the canal system's heyday. It was cool to see the demonstration of how canal locks worked. Canal locks are scattered throughout the park, so seeing one in action was helpful. Brandywine Falls is stunning. I could have stood there and watched it for hours. Again, the parks service did a great job with interpreting the history of the area. It was interesting to see the photos and map of the mill that used to operate on the falls.Another thing that impressed me was that the park is chock full of bike trails. We hadn't thought to bring our bikes, but what a wonderful resource! It was also great to see that they were using old houses for park offices instead of putting up new buildings for that purpose. That is a nice show of respect for the history of the area. Although the Frazey House was closed to renovation so we couldn't go on, I am happy that an almost 200 year old house being brought back to life.I have to give big thumbs up to how friendly and helpful park staff was, too.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We have seen 50 of our nation's 59 NP's. While this is not at the top of our list, it is the 11th most visited. Resting on 33,000 acres between Cleveland and Akron, this is a thank god they saved the land park. When you visit, the must do's are a ride on the train, biking or hiking the historic Towpath along the old Ohio-Erie Canal, hiking the Ledges, taking a ranger led hike, visiting all the centers, and seeing Lock 38.Ranger Jonathan gave us an hours worth of geology and history about Brandywine Falls. He's only worked there three years, but what a fine knowledgeable young man.If you can stay with George and Katie Hoy at the Brandywine Inn, a restored home and one of the oldest structures in the park.The train doesn't run Monday and Tuesday, so plan around that. The Towpath is an easy bike route. Stop at Century Cycles in Peninsula and get a great bike or bring your own.That said, this is an urban park. Along the scenic River Fall drive to the Beaver Marsh and the heronry you will pass a trailer park. And around the park they are building some of the most god awful structures, like the new Arhaus monster off Old Eight.Take it for what it is.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"This national park has many beautiful and quiet areas; however, since this national park is surrounded by many major interstate highways and power lines, these areas can be hard to find. For example, there are no nice overlooks with stunning scenery (of course, we may be spoiled by the 20 other national parks we visited with awesome scenic views). My recommendation is to stick to the falls, marsh, and other historic sites. Here is a detailed list of things to do/see:- Beaver Marsh: Look for beavers, otters, muskrats, water fowl, turtles, and fish along the wetland boardwalk.- Tinker's Creek Gorge Scenic Overlook: Best overlook that we found in the park.- Bridal Veil Falls: Beautiful cascade. Visit after a heavy rain to see it at its best.- Brandywine Falls: second highest falls in Ohio- Blue Hen Falls: An overhanging plate of sandstone protrudes from the underlying shale. The small stream falls about fifteen feet from its edge.- Ledges Overlook: most popular overlook in the park- Ritchie Ledges: Towering sandstone Ritchie Ledges was the highlight of the park.- Bike the Towpath Trail: A beautiful bike path that offers views of the river and forest.Bike Aboard! is a program where you can bike the Towpath Trail in one direction, then hop on the train for a relaxing ride back to your car.","June 27, 2015",Very Accessible National Park,148,"Leominster, Massachusetts",4

Also drive to see the pretty Creek George.Must see all the exhibits in the Visitors center.If you are lucky you can witness white tailed deer and Canada geese. It was drizzling when we drove in the park. We could not see any wildlife, coyotees, which they saw is around sometimes. There are classes for primary and middle school children.

One of the paths follows the towpath of the Ohio and Erie canal which still traverses through the the park. The park has three visitor centers, each offering something different. A closer examination of a lock and the canal can be made at the Canal Visitor Center as well has some great presentations on the history of the Valley. Also traversing through the park is the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railway - providing a nice three hour roundtrip ride through the park.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,CVNP represents the best efforts of the late 20th Century park movement. It represents an attempt to preserve nature near a major urban area that otherwise would be suburbia. The park does a nice job of combining history with naturalism.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"This National Park, just south of Cleveland, OH follows the old Ohio and Erie Canal.For us the greatest feature was the cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad, which follws the old canal as well. The deal for bicyclers is unbeatable. For $3 you an your bike get a trainride north or south (one way) and get dropped off at the station of your choice. At that point you can bicycle back to your starting point, enjoying the park's features and scenery along the way. We chose to ride then bike although either is possible, but that way there is no schedule to meet once you start biking. The canal exposition center was excellent, with people in period costume working a restored lock. We kunched in the town of Peninsula - right on the trail. There is a wetlands area with beavers and other wildlife. Not to be missed in the spring is the Heron rookery - MANY nests and heron chicks.

It has a train that runs through it and even a pretty good size (60 ft.) waterfall in it.The only negative thing (at least to me) was that the park seemed to be set up more for hikers and bikers.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"My husband and I just spent the weekend at Cuyahoga Valley National Park located between Cleveland and Akron, OH. We arrived on Friday afternoon and stayed at the Hampton Inn inRichfield, OH.. This park is very different from any other national park I've seen as it's situated around small towns and between two large metropolitan areas.  This park has attractions for many types of people: biking, hiking, train rides, museums, small towns with shops, farmers markets, etc.  On Friday, we hiked a wooded area called The Ledges that was beautiful and reminded me of the country around Old Man's Cave in southeast Ohio. We also went to a newly-opened Canal Era museum that was interactive and informative. There are parts of that museum that are definitely geared towards children. On Sat morning, we frequented a great farmer's market followed by a visit to the lovely and interesting Hale Farm and Village where a crafts fair was taking place. After lunch at Hale Farm, we spent several hours on the train (not that exciting) and finally drove into Akron to have dinner with some family members of mine.  The proximity of Cuyahoga Valley National Park to Akron and Cleveland makes traveling to those cities pretty easy via I-271, I-77 and other connecting highways.  The visitors that would probably benefit the most from Cuyahoga Valley National Park are those who can bike the 100+ towpath between north Akron and Cleveland as well as hikers who can explore all the various trails. As I cannot do those things due to some physical limitations, I felt that two days there was sufficient for my purposes. There are different events and festivities that take place in the nearby towns at various times of the year, so those things could be the focal point of someone's future trips to the park.  Lodging in the park is limited, but there are a number of motels in the area that require only a short drive to arrive at the destinations of your choice.","September 2, 2014",Different kind of national park,31,"Bexley, Ohio",5
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Recent trip to this National Park. Hiked to 3 different waterfalls, Brandywine, Bridal Veil, and Blue Hen.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Bike path south from Brecksville winds along the tow path of the historic (now abandoned) Ohio and Erie Canal. The path, mostly hard-packed dirt-and-fine-gravel, runs all the way from Cleveland to Akron and beyond, has a mile-by-mile guidebook available, and goes through several historic canal-service settlements, including Boston, where there are displays maintained by the NPS. It is a busy bike path, with lots of families. A beautiful part of Ohii, well- preserved, and an opportunity for fun healthy exercise.","August 27, 2014","Busy, fun bike path",41,,5
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We didnt have an entire day to spend here so I think we missed a lot of it but what we did do we enjoyed. We hiked over to the waterfall, the name is slipping my tongue. Brandywine I think. We also hiked down to the riverbed to the rocky areas as my girlfriend likes to search for geodes these days. So we walked along the river as far as we could taking pictures and looking at rocks. There were plenty of other trails we did not have time in our stay to explore but hopefully next time we will.","August 20, 2014",Wished we had more time.,157,"Williamsport, Pennsylvania",4
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Wished we had more time to spend in the park! We only had a half-day here but were able to squeeze in the Brandywine Falls gorge trail, Ledges trail, and a quick visit to Beaver marsh, and enjoyed every minute of it. The falls gorge trail was nice and worth it if you have the time as it takes you down into the valley along the river but the two must see stops here if you're pressed on time are the Falls overlook (which is only a 10 minute walk from the parking lot) and the Ledges trail. The falls overlook gives you the best view of the falls and allows for some nice photo ops, and the Ledges trail was like stepping into a geology book as it takes you down into the depths of the ledges and offers spectacular views of the geological layers in the rock ledges as well as the abundance of trees that surround you. Beaver marsh offered a totally different view of a nice wetland with lavender fields abundant (and if we had more time I would have liked to bike the adjacent trails as many others were doing). All in all this was our favorite stop during our 3 day trip to NE Ohio, do not miss this unique and beautiful park!","August 16, 2014",Loved this unique National Park,42,"Miami, Fl",5
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We drove to the Brecksville train station which was not hard to find. Get the address for the Cuyahoga Valley RR website. We parked the car and then hopped on board the train with the Ride Aboard program. It was $3.00 for the train ride. It runs Wed- Sunday through Oct 26th. The guy did have change but it was easiest to have the money. They also sold concession on the train. The train ride itself was a bit chilly. We rode down to Botzum and got off the train. Our bikes were already off and waiting for us. The ride back to Brecksville was about 14 miles. We passed so many locks , I was afraid we wouldn't see any.... Lots of herons, turtles, deer, etc... We rode over a beautiful wetland area that was filled with lily pads. We went right by Szalays and also an ice cream store. We could have stopped for lunch in Peninsula if we had wanted to. This was a wonderful day and I can't wait to ride again.","August 13, 2014",What a fun day for a bike ride!,82,"Powell, Ohio, United States",5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Geography and geology departments should use this experience of walking in this park as an incentive or reason to obtain a degree in those two disciplines. If you need a reason to avoid Detroit, Chicago or Manhattan here it is in abundance. A few visits here will give you a bachelor's degree value or equivalent of knowledge about geology and geography as well as botany. If you need a reason to learn landscape architecture here it is. If you need a reason to avoid urban areas here it is in abundance. While touring this place for the first or second time last century I was waiting for somebody to ask me to take a hike. My geology class took me here years ago and I have never looked back since then to see what I was missing on campus. If you want to know what better way to forget about urban blight here it is. Numerous parts get forgotten if you concentrate on just a limited or small part of this magnificent park as it extends in many directions that can be appreciated only if you walk through them on foot or look at a map. I imagine that for regular working class people lacking resources and looking for a vacation spot near by - what could be better than visiting this park? It is inexpensive or free for starters. This place can give you satisfaction for having visited a national park if it is too expensive to travel to the western parts of this country to see the other more frames ones. For people with limited resources a visit here can bring happiness and good feelings for having shown respect for the wilderness. The Jolly Green Giant and Smokey the Bear will not greet you at the entry but there are many guides with knowledge to help you and others appreciate and benefit from a trip here. There was for me many years ago and just recently a museum like atmosphere for visiting this place. I felt that I was in the Louvre for wilderness. This was for me like visiting the British Museum for sure just for admiring the beauty of earth. Monet's water lilies might mean something extra for art lovers. I was able to appreciate many still life paintings done by the Dutch masters in the seventeenth century. Chardon's still-life paintings acquired additional importance for me. Go see Meinert Hobema's landscape painting of the water mill now on display as part of the permanent collection at the Cleveland Art Museum. Go see the other landscape paintings by the same Dutch masters from the same period on display at the Cleveland Art Museum. I could mention the paintings of other painters but I have run out of time. The flowers done by the French painters are an example that comes to mind. Maybe this park can be seen as a laboratory or classroom for doing impressionist paintings. I imagine that the paintings done by Thompson from Canada would have meaning here for people who love the Canadian wilderness. I have visited the McMichael's gallery north of Toronto and while that place is somewhat different in both focus or purpose and emphasis there was reason to pat myself on the back for having gone there recently. Walking along the trails in this park is the best you can do to invigorate your appreciation of art and the wilderness. You can not and should not say that if you have seen one forest you have seen them all. That phrase does not apply - and does not belong here - here for reasons having to do with the regional history of heavy industrialization and urbanization that have for many years tormented the lives of so many people here for this part of Ohio. Go to the area of Youngstown and see what I mean. See the former steel mills in and around Cleveland and Youngstown to fully understand this statement. You can fill your day with many hikes - maybe the Ledges is the best - but I will leave that up to you. Rock formations will give you many reasons to study geology. For me and other older people the educational program for outreaching to the young and older people in surrounding communities is an important part for the park's mission. If you want to know what you might have missed learning in school here it is in abundance. Trails are extensive and are providing people with an endless display of natural beauty. There is no waiting in the waiting room to get started walking. In the southern part of Ohio there are two parks that feature natural beauty but I think this place is more magnificent and better. Photographs are there to be taken. Unlike many of the large art museums like the Rom or the Louvre or the British Museum with vast collections of paintings and art, this place will not wear you out if you stay for three, four or more hours at a visit. Walking here is more leisurely than going from room to room in those large art museums with a large crowd at your heels. If you like to walk or bike there is plenty to do here. By all means brown bag it here with a picnic. People who just want to drop in or pop in briefly for a short visit are doing a huge disservice to themselves.This is not the place to pop in for only a brief visit. I do imagine that painters like to come here to paint and photographers like to photograph scenes. Many people might not admit it but there are people who would like to transport part of the park to their front yard. I say this because most good people are by human nature receptive to natural beauty. I do not know if the park is receptive to handicapped people or not. But you might end up intellectually handicapped if you miss seeing and visiting this park when you have a chance to do so. Yes, it is like a gem. Parallels with seeing the magnificent falls at Niagara might come to mind also. I encourage you to read about trees and rock formations and flowers to fully appreciate the importance of this park. Study botany and geology for fun.","August 11, 2014",like visiting a museum of art. Still-life paintings are more important now.,297,"Akron, Ohio",5

Locomotive also passed right through the park during our visit.we hiked the Brandywine Falls Trail, a 1.4 mile loop that's boardwalk and very family-friendly.

I've been traveling on business to Akron and Cuyahoga Valley is a short drive from work. I've gone in the evenings to see different parts of the park. They have very well maintained trails and a variety of difficulty levels. The park is well used and the bike paths are busy. The towpath is great for a long run or a nice flat bike ride. Brandywine Falls is a must see. You can drive right up to the top of it or you can hike 1.5 miles of moderate difficulty from another parking area. The park is very accessible which makes it easy to explore different parts of the park. You do see the history of the locks along the riverside. Not as interesting as I thought but did give me a much greater appreciation of what was accomplished with the canal and locks back in the day. Blue Hen Falls were very easy to get close to by car but no much to see. Most of the trails are well travelled with the exception of some of the longer ones that cross over multiple ridges.

Ran out of time but wanted to do blue hen falls and salt run trail too. Definitely bring bikes if you them. Cover much more ground that way.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We spent our first day at CVNP hiking various areas of the park. The Ledges area was very nice. Lots of limestone walls. We went to the Brandywine Falls which was just a short walk from the parking lot. The rangers at the visitor centers are very helpful, pointing out places to go depending on your time, interests and abilities. We also visited the Beaver Marsh. Tho we heard lots of frogs, we did not see any wildlife even tho we were there in the early morning. On the second day we rode our bikes on the tow path. It follows the old canal which in many places was still apparent. Many of the locks still exist. It was a very nice trail, a little narrower than we are used to. Mostly not paved but hardpack.We road 16 miles thru wooded areas, fields, a couple of small towns and past wetlands . It was a very picturesque. We rode from Indigo Lake station to the Canal Visitor Center. There is a very nice museum dedicated to the canals at this location.At this point we waited for the train to take us back to our car. The Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad runs through here. For $3, you and your bike can ride the train one way back to your car. A very good bargain.CVNP is different from most National Parks.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"This park is a bicyclists and hiker's dream. What less inspired visitors seem to miss is the unique terrain, in between the Appalachian mountains and the prairies of the midwest and the up close access that the park development provides. Add the fascinating Indian culture as well as the New England Western Reserve settlers' history and architecture and the rich learning experience is there for the taking. The 100 mile towpath trail provides a close up view of the canal that opened the unsettled interior of our young nation and connected it directly by water to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Bicyclists who explore the towpath trail in between the river and canal can return on the historic railroad for just $2.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"I'm glad we visited, but for me this park was a one-visit park only. It seems to cater mostly to (urban) locals, who I'm sure do appreciate having a ""wilderness"" area nearby.Highlights for me were Brandywine Falls, and the Beaver Marsh. I saw several different species of birds at the marsh, including several blue herons. I also saw a deer close to the trail. Brandywine Falls is very photogenic.The downside is that, at least when we were there, there was a lot of traffic...especially bike traffic. All the bikes zooming down the canal trail and beaver marsh trails made it difficult to walk on. Even though I was by myself and stayed way to the right of the trail, I felt like I was getting dirty looks from the bike crowd. Another disappointment was the canal trail. I thought it would be similar to the canal trail at Harper's Ferry, which actually has water in it. Not so, at least the part I walked on (by the Boston Store). A little section had water in it; the rest of it is like walking beside a weed-choked ditch.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"It's hard to believe that there is a National Park right in between Akron and Cleveland. While it may not have the size and splendor of some of the huge national parks out west, it offers a variety of beautiful scenes and hikes just a short ride away. It's great for a one-day adventure, or even a half day get-away. There are lots of people in Northeast Ohio who aren't even aware of what it offers. One really nice offering is the tow path along the old canal. It's a mostly flat trail, great for biking or walking. Part of the trail goes over the Beaver Marsh where you are likely to spot turtles, swifts, geese, herons and more. You might also see the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad train go by. It stops at several locations along the rail, where you can hop off (with your bike if you have it) and hop on at another stop. Two waterfalls are accessible with fairly easy hikes. Brandywine Falls is pretty impressive, though you are limited to a boardwalk and deck viewing area. Blue Hen Falls has less water, but it falls down a large horseshoe shaped ledge. It's gorgeous in autumn, and a favorite location for photographers. The park includes areas of rocky ledges, river, fields, deep woods and the ""living history"" Hale Farm and Village. Because it is so easy to get to, it can get busy.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We visited the park on a busy Sunday afternoon. We first stopped at the Boston Mills visitor center to get acquainted with the park as this was our first visit. Trying to find parking near the visitor center was difficult. Luckily, someone moved and we got the last spot in the parking lot. The Park Rangers were very friendly and even mapped out points of interest that we might like to see. There is a small gift shop and exhibit in this building. Across the street is another building that sells snacks, sandwiches and gift shop items. They have picnic tables and benches beside this building as well. The towpath runs right through here so there are many bikers; keep an eye out when coming through this part. We chose to drive to Brandywine Falls; it’s about ten minutes away from the visitor center. There is plenty of parking so there was no difficulty finding a spot. It was a short walk to the falls and then we did the walking trail up and around the falls. It was a pretty sight, but I’m glad we didn’t go too out of our way to visit. At the top of the falls, you can see and hear the cars on the street which kind of took away some of its tranquility. The trail was crowded! It was hard to take a relaxing hike when there were so many people everywhere. Dogs are allowed on the trail, but many people were not keeping them close by and allowing them to run up to strangers and sniff them or jump up on them. This happened to us twice. After visiting the falls, we decided to go see the ledges which was another ten minute drive from Brandywine. Like with Brandywine, there was plenty of parking to visit the ledges. A short walk leads you to them and they are very interesting to look at. Ice box cave is closed due to the declining bat population. The ledges weren’t near as crowded as the falls had been so it was much easier to enjoy our walk. We got some nice photos and for those interested in outdoor photography this area has many opportunities for a great picture. While everything we visited was very pretty, I did not leave feeling impressed or have an overwhelming urge to come back. Like other reviewers have noted, it does not feel like a National Park; especially because of all the houses mixed in with the park. Overall, I was expecting things to be maintained better. The bathrooms were disgusting near both Brandywine and the ledges; it looked like little effort was put forth into maintaining their cleanliness. Perhaps if we had chosen a weekday instead of a weekend day our visit might have been different. However, in my opinion I would recommend a visit only if you are close by and just want to spend a casual afternoon. I would not plan a long drive or long weekend around a visit. There is no entrance fee, so if you're looking for something free to do in the area then you might want to check it out.","June 6, 2014","Nice, but wouldn't go out of my way to visit",267,United States,3
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"in the southern park of the park is a little spot on the map marked as ""Heronry."" The ranger told us about it or we would not have even stopped. You stop at a little pull off at the side of the road and then look in the trees across the street. There were what the ranger said was 64 heron nests in the two trees. It was great to watch. The nests are 2 ft deep and 3-4 foot across. You can watch the parents fly out, return with food and then feed the young. Binoculars would really help here, but even without them we could see it all very well. Walk across the road if you want to take photos, then the electrical wires won't be in the pictures. There is a guardrail you can stand behind. Well worth the stop. I can still hear all of the birds calling out. Really neat.","June 4, 2014","Visit the heronry, awesome",53,"Toledo, Ohio",5

The only downfall is that on nice days, the trail can be a bit crowded for the first/last mile or two close to the multiple entrance point parking lots.

The trail is an easy, flat ride following the beautiful rushing waters of the Cuyahoga River and the old Ohio Erie Canal towpath. Some of the canal locks are fairly well intact with good quality signs to explain its history. There are also a few places to stop and see wildlife along the way. The Trail can become crowded in spots, especially closer to the center of the park at midday. We visited the Hale Farm and Village on a past visit and greatly enjoyed it. However, we were surprised to find out this time that it opens the week after Memorial Day. We rode the scenic train in the past. We would recommend it for kids who like that kind of activity. However, we were unable to see a lot from the old commuter rail cars. We would recommend using the scenic train perhaps to get from one end of the park to another, or after seeing everything else. Those expecting the scale and brilliance of the Smoky Mountain National Park or Yellowstone will be disappointed. This park is a great regional park, and has a lot to offer for a short stay. We would recommend it to anyone who lives within a few hours drive or who will be in the area looking for a day or overnight trip to getaway and enjoy being outdoors.","February 12, 2014",Great Place to Spend A Day,58,Pittsburgh,4
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Nestled between I-271 and I-77 is a beautiful gem of a National Park. With the mountainous terrain of the area, it's a bit hard to get to but worth it.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,We spent a snowy day exploring the Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The trails were snowy so boots were required. Brandywine Falls boardwalk was fun and the icicles were beautiful. We visited a couple of visitor centers. The movie about the park tells the story of creating a park in the middle of a populated valley. Check the hours before going to a visitor center - hours vary in the winter. Everett Road covered bridge is worth the walk. You just don't see covered bridges much at all any more. It was nice to see this one up close.,"December 12, 2013",Charming in the winter,130,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"I have lived near this park all my life. There are many distinct areas with excellent walking trails ranging from easy to difficult. There is the 2.5 mile loop starting at Kendall Lake. There is a loop trail that explores the Ledges rock formations. There is a 3.5 loop trail starting near the Happy Days Lodge. There is a beautiful 2.75 loop trail near Horseshoe lake that cuts through a tree farm. There are so many trails that you need a book to cover them all. My wife and I bought a condo adjacent to the park, so now I can walk directly into the park from my home. I take a moderate trail down a ravine and hit the Towpath trail in 10 minutes.

The park is spread out and is intertwined with the little towns around and within it.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We travel the 2 hours to Cuyahoga Valley National Park every few months. It is close to the Ohio Turnpike, Interstate 77 and Route 8.We enjoy all 4 seasons in the park ! We usually stay overnight in Independence, Ohio and enjoy the park for 2 full days. Independence is clean, safe, has a lot of good hotels and restaurants and is close to the Cuyahoga National Valley Railroad and the Towpath Trail off of Rockside Road. There is no entrance fee for the park.The park has activities for all levels. For those with limited abilities, there is the railroad ( fee ), long drives, short hikes. For those who love more active days, there are the great bicycle paths, the ski trails (fee), and the numerous hiking trails. We love biking the Towpath Trail. It is realatively flat and has interesting and beautiful stops along the way. You can rent a bicycle in Penninsula, Ohio, if you are unable to bring your own.Penninsula is also a great place to stop for a meal while biking, hiking, or taking the train ride. You can even bike 1 way and ride the train back for a fee for you and your bicycle. Our favorite hiking trail is Ledges.It reminds us of Hocking Hills. It is full of beautiful rock formations. We also enjoy Brandywine Falls. Some trails connect to other trails. Pets are welcome.The park is home to many birds and animals, the Cuyahoga River, waterfalls, small lakes, hills, old canal locks, a quarry, Hale Farm, Boston Mills Ski Resort, and and Blossom Music Center. Some areas have flush toilets, while others have pit toilets. Bring water.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"I didn't realize that Cuyahoga Valley National Park existed prior to my visit. Before going, I wondered how it was even a National Park, well, call me impressed! I would return a heartbeat.To start with, the area is very scenic. We did a few hikes in the park and they were all great. You can't go wrong unless you skip them. However, the gem of the park is the bike path. It travels north-south through the park. We only rode a section of it, but it is beautifully maintained and makes for a wonderful ride. We opted not to take the train, but for those interested, you can bike to one end of the park (or any of the train stops) and pick up the train for a ride back to your starting point. That to me is just amazing.During our ride we stumbled upon a farmer's market. That was just a perfect distraction from our ride. We ate a few homemade goodies and were back on our way.If you are in the area or thinking of being in the area, I would highly recommend visiting the park. One key thing is we visited before the summer season. I would wager that peak season is very busy on the bike trail so if you can head there in the shoulder seasons you will be rewarded.","October 14, 2013",Hidden Gem,65,"Rochester, New York",5

The main ""trail"" is an old barge tow path; because this path is wide and mostly flat, it attracts a LOT of joggers, walkers, bicyclers.

A waterfall, river, rock features and more, all in one park. It would be fun to bring bikes and ride the trails that allow them. Everyone we met was super nice.

I kid you not, some moron even was walking around playing a bagpipe (loudly and not well) right on the trail where there are supposed to be beavers…well needless to say, nobody saw any beavers that day! It’s the only National Park (and I’ve been to many) where I had to hold onto my kids as we walked because there was serious threat of people, bikes, etc running into each other.

I started at the Hunt Farm Visitor Information Center, 2054 Bolanz Rd., Peninsula, OH, 44264 and rode north to the Cuyahoga Valley Railway Station in downtown Peninsula. It is near The Trail Mix Gift Store and the Elements Art Gallery. I stopped to eat ice cream at Fisher's Restaurant and returned to my starting point at Szalay's Sweet Corn Farm store. I got fruits and veggies and tried some roasted corn-on-the cob and refreshing lemonade. Szalay's is located at 4563 Riverview Rd Peninsula, OH 44264 (330) 657-27274-1497. The bike ride up and then down on the towpath was relaxing and very enjoyable. I got to visit a gift store, two National Park Visitor's Centers, an art gallery, an ice cream counter & a sit down restaurant and the best ""fruit' and corn stand I know all in one five mile section of the towpath. It was heaven on earth and I did not think I was exercising. I saw lots of birds, deer, turtles and a few thing I was not sure of ...........in and around the bike way.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"It took us a while to get our bearings here as it is spread out with several information sites scattered through the park. We should have studied more about the park on line before our visit. At any rate we spent a very nice afternoon hiking several trails and seeing several pretty waterfalls and lots of wildlife. (This is a wonderful outdoor resource for folks in the Cleveland area!) There is a lot of history here about the Canal and some nice exhibits about the boats etc in the information buildings. Check it out on line before you visit. It doesn't have the grandeur of some National Parks but don't let negative reviews keep you away. The set up of the park is a little confusing as it is spread out and you go in and out of the Park through residential areas and towns. Another area that is next to the National Park but is apparently a city or state park is the Viaduct Park? and Great Falls. With a map we got in the National Park and some persistence we found this place and walked through it. There are plaques along the walkways that explain some interesting history of the site.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Cuyahoga Park was not a destination for us, but rather a stop along the way to somewhere else, but we were pleasantly surprised at what this lovely national park had to offer. As always, the Visitor Center was the place to start, and we were given two main destinations for the several hours we had to spend. First we did a hike on the main trail which runs throughout the park. It is great for hikers and bikers, and was a nice way to stretch our legs and enjoy a little nature. Our second stop was to a beautiful waterfall, which involved some climbing up wooden steps and platforms, but was well worth the hike. Our final stop was Beaver Marsh, where we were told the beavers put on a show in the early and late hours of the day. We were not disappointed - we got to see several of the little guys swimming by, some with branches in their teeth. One even put on a bit of a show, by swimming around and around to the delight of the audience above him. We also saw a heron, some big turtles, and another couple saw a huge snake hanging out on a branch in the swamp. Well worth the stop. As usual, ask the park staff for recommendations, and just relax and enjoy the surroundings for what they are. Nature is beautiful, and always has much to offer if you look for it.","August 19, 2013",Spend a Day,255,"Evanston, Illinois",4
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,Ohio's only National Park is in name only. Just a wooded area with a small stream and a 30 foot waterfall that was half flowing when we were there. There were some trails which amounted to nothing more than a walk in the fields. There are some bike paths if you are so inclined. On the positive side there is no entrance fee and it is a short walk to the waterfall. But to call this a National Park stretches the imagination.

It was nice and cool, I did walk to the first train station there and back. I did walk a total of 1.75 miles each way. The visitor's center was closed due to construction.

We parked at the north end of the park off Rockside road and headed south to the Canal Visitor center (closed for renovations). Round trip was about 10 miles. You hit lock #39 about a mile from the parking lot (headed south) - in pretty bad shape. You pass a couple of other canal historical markers along the way before you get to the visitors center where there is a lock with what looks like working gates. The visitors center is just a couple of blocks from the train stop (trains run several times a day - riders can catch the train one way for $3, runners $9 - schedule at http://www.cvsr.com).

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We had a wonderful time at Cuyahoga Valley NP!!The one downfall to this park, is the layout.... It's spread out throughout the city unlike most National Parks-where once you enter- you are there.... This park; every ""attraction"" was in a different part of the city and it was VERY confusing!We started out at the Boston Visitor Center. We arrived about 8am and were disappointed to see it was closed. (didn't open till 10am). Thankfully we spotted a ranger and were able to ask directions to Brandywine Falls. Turns out due to the weird layout of the park; we had a 15 min drive to the falls.... FYI: turns out several of the ""attractions"" can be pulled up on your GPS which really helps a TON with this park and it's odd layout!Brandywine Falls trail was moderate; not super hard, but not super easy either. It was a 1.5 mile trail. The trail had great overlooks and Brandywine Falls was beautiful! Very worth the hike!!!Next we went to the Ledges. This is absolutely NOT to be missed! SO.MUCH.FUN!! There was signage that Icebox Cave was closed due to white noise syndrome; when we seen this we considered turning back, I'm soooo glad we didn't! The ledges are like a giant maze and the kids (both the young ones and the teens) had an absolute blast! Words nor pictures can do it justice- just be sure to take the Ledges trail weather Ice box cave is closed or not!! Parts of the ledges- you have to squeeze or crawl through and I just can't express how fun it was.... The little kids had to be dragged out of there... I really hope to make it back here someday!!We also visited the Everett Road Covered Bridge. The map/info was a little deceiving as I thought we would be able to drive over the covered bridge, but that is no longer an option- you park and walk over the bridge; but it's a super short, easy walk. There was some history information provided about the bridge itself and I found it very interesting.The Peninsula visitor center/train station was out of Junior Ranger books; so we had to pick those up at a diff center; given how spread out this park is- they should really make more efforts to keep ALL visitor centers stocked with these books and such.The Peninsula visitor center/train station had picnic tables next to it and we enjoyed the sandwiches we had packed in with us.We did take the scenic train ride and unfortunately it was less than impressive. A good chunk of the train ride is through a residential area and simply not worth the time or money. Despite the disappointing train ride, the park overall was just wonderful!This park is the tenth most visited National Park and I can see why! I hope to visit here again someday!!","July 30, 2013",Awesome park!!,34,"Atlanta, Georgia",5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"I love the overall beauty and tranquility of the entire Cuyahoga Valley National Park. The park covers a great portion of the Cuyahoga River Valley and runs parallel to the Ohio and Erie Canal, which was built in the early 1800's and is responsible for making it possible to settle the Ohio wilderness. The park boasts a great number of attractions and activities for all. Hiking and bike trails, Skiing, Wetlands, several Waterfalls, The ""Tow Path Trail"" (which was the original tow path that the mules trod upon for pulling the canal boats along the canal) is very flat and well suited for hiking, jogging, bicycling and sight seeing. Along the towpath trail are the remnants of the old canal locks as well as many of the historic building and stores and villages built along the canal, etc. There is also the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad which runs along the 26-mile length of the park 3 times daily with stops along the way, including the historic sites of Hale Farm, the old train depots in Peninsula and Independence, etc. If you have a family and you haven't a lot of money to spend on a vacation, you should really consider Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Hotels in the area are inexpensive and there is absolutely NO ADMISSION FEE for the park and most of the activities (though there is a charge for snow-skiing and the train excursion, etc.).","July 29, 2013","Beautiful, peaceful and full of fun activities and places",16,"Mantua, Ohio",5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Our family, including two children - ages 3 and 11 enjoyed our 1/2 day trip to Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Our kids enjoyed earning their Junior Park Ranger badges and our daughter really enjoyed interviewing a Park Ranger. The Ranger recommended the Beaver Marsh Trail for us to walk along which we did. It was great. Most of the path was shaded which was helpful as it was getting rather warm. It also followed along some of the remains of the old canal system which was interesting to see. The kids had fun spotting a snake, fish, and turtles in the beaver marsh. The walk was completely level and was being enjoyed by many bikers. From what we seen, this park is a wonderful place for bicyclers to enjoy! Many trails to choose from and I believe a lot of them connect to each other. After the walk, we stopped at the Hunt Farm (farmers market) for cold drinks. A lot of bicyclers were there, enjoying many fresh fruits, ice cream, and fresh roasted corn on the cob. It was a nice place to take a break and the prices were very reasonable!You could very easily spend an entire day at this park or longer if you want to bicycle or do more hiking. We were driving through the area on our way to Niagara Falls & Maine so we just wanted a break from driving. It was a very enjoyable & relaxing park! Glad we stopped and the kids really enjoyed it!

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Your first thought is ... a national park? In Ohio? Once you get there, you think, wow! What we liked most about the park is that it was a surprise. There will significant hills, overlooks and waterfalls (the Brandywine falls were a treat not only because they were larger than expected, but there was a hillside boardwalk that allowed you to hear it for some time before actually seeing it). The trail along the tree-shaded Ohio and Erie Canal towpath made us wish we had been better prepared. We walked along a boardwalk through a marsh (which had formerly been an auto dump!) and saw beavers, geese and turtles. The people of Ohio who have transformed this near-the-city park should be congratulated ... they have preserved a natural area that is a joy to visit and has much to offer from an educational standpoint. Although many would say it doesn't compare to the magnificent natural scenery of the western national parks, it was an appropriate addition to the national park system in that it preserves the area and offers a glimpse into the American historical past.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Visited the park in late April, 2013. This is a very long park that follows the Cuyahoga River and the remains of the Ohio-Erie canal which roughly parallels the river. The old towpath has been restored into a jogging/biking trail that is quite nice, passing several of the old locks as well as a beaver marsh with lots of beaver, muskrats, and other wildlife. The best hiking we found was at the Brandywine Gorge Trail which loops around the falls and follows the creek for a short distance before joining the Standford Trail. Hiking the gorge trail in a counter clockwise fashion, then taking a right at the Standford Trail junction to do that trail then returning to the parking lot will give you a hike of a little over 4 miles. The hike to the Standford House is through an interesting forest and, near the house, passes by several tent camping sites with picnic tables, good for a lunch stop, and goes beyond the house to the towpath along the remains of the canal. The other hike we liked was the Ledges Trail in the Virginia Kendal area of the park. It is a loop about two miles long in total and takes you by some really impressive rock formations as well as a cave that has been closed to the public in order to protect the bats that use the cave. It is possible to rent bikes and ride the towpath trail for as long as you would like. The Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad offers a good deal, allowing bikers to ride the train in one direction, with their bikes, for $2.00 and then the riders pedal back in the other direction to return to their cars. You can ride the train first or ride bikes first. Taking the complete tour on the train without biking is a cost of around $12. The train runs only on weekends until June when it will operate more often. We rented bikes from Great Lakes Touring Company in Cleveland for $24 per bike for a half day rental. Joseph and his mom Bonnie met us at the Canal Visitor Center with the bikes. We rode the train to Peninsula, disembarked, rode the bikes on to Everett, then back north on the towpath to the Canal Visitor Center Once we completed our ride back to the visitor center, Bonnie was there to pick up the bikes. A helmet, a basket for the bike, and a bottle of water are provide for each rider. Both, Joseph and Bonnie were pleasant, helpful, and very knowledgeable about the towpath, train, park, and the area in general. A very enjoyable and reasonably priced outing for a half day.","May 10, 2013",Surprisingly nice urban park.,374,"Central, South Carolina",5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Sunday, April 07, 2013 - MsHick and I spend a lot of time in National Parks, but very little in the one right in our backyard, Cuyahoga Valley. The last time we did any serious outdoor activity in CVNP was back in 2004 when we rented bikes and rode along the tow path for a few hours. As I recall we rode from Peninsula north to Boston Store Visitor Center. So today we headed back to the park for a little hiking as it was one of the first nice days of spring.We left the house at 9:30 and we arrived at the Boston Store Visitor Center at 10:00 AM. We went to the Visitor Center and asked about hiking opportunities in the park. The volunteer, Sally, gave us a couple of good options, Ledges and Brandywine Falls. Turns out that we could string together a few trails and hike from the Visitor Center to the falls, rather than drive to the trailhead, so that’s what we did. We started off heading north on the tow path to the Stanford House trail, then to the Brandywine Gorge loop. Almost 6 miles, mostly through forested areas. There was a lot of traffic on all segments of the trail today, but most was on the tow path (lots of joggers and bikers) and near the falls (many people were walking the loop from the Brandywine Falls parking area).The first half-mile of the hike is along the wide and flat tow path that runs along the old canal. At this point there is a connecting trail that crosses the canal and leads to the Stanford House. From the house, we followed the trail to the Brandywine Gorge. We did take the short sour trail to Averill Pond. It is just a couple hundred yards to get to the lake, which is pretty but nothing spectacular. We only saw two Canada Geese at the pond. Once back at the main trail, we started our descent into the gorge. It was along this stretch that we encountered the first set of steps on the trail. The good news is that steps are in good shape and very even in terms of their height and spacing. The trail drops down to a creek, crosses two foot bridges then reaches the loop trail for the falls; turning left is one mile to the bridge while a right turn is a quarter mile, but with a steep set of steps at the start of the route. We took the right turn. The trial climbs up the steps and runs into an abandoned road. We turned right here, walked up the road a few hundred yards and reached the parking area for the falls. There are restrooms here. After a short break we walked the boardwalks to the falls overlooks. I think the lower boardwalk provides the best view.The upper boardwalk runs past the ruins of the old mill and other industrial facilities on the same site, and then connects with the main trail. The trail winds past the Brandywine Inn, the drops back down into the gorge. The trial runs past some small ponds that are just loaded with frogs (never saw any, but you can certainly hear them singing), then crosses Brandywine Creek along a long foot bridge. Shortly after the bridge, the trail again crosses the abandoned road and shortly after that hits the intersection with the Stanford House trail, completing the loop.As mentioned, it was early April when we made this hike. The trees were just starting to bud, the daffodils had not yet bloomed, but the crocuses were in their full glory. So it was not the most scenic of hikes with the lack of foliage. We decided it might be good to repeat the hike throughout the season (later in the spring, summer and of course the fall with the autumn colors).Other than the geese at Averill Pond, we did not see a lot of wildlife. We heard a LOT of frogs in the ponds and wetlands along the trail and of course songbirds. Back at the tow path we saw three hawks soaring overhead and got a nice photo of a red squirrel. There was also a Mallard pair napping on a log in the old canal.Overall this was a nice hike. The trail was in good shape. Most of the trail is fairly wide and all were in good condition. There are some areas with roots and rocks once in the gorge and along the creeks, but that is to be expected out in the woods. I think we need to make a habit of visiting the CVNP.","April 9, 2013",Boston Store Visitor Center to Brandywine Falls; now that’s a nice hike.,918,"Ohio, USA",4

All turned out OK though. There are many good trail heads in the park for cycling, jogging, and hiking. The canal and lock remnants are fascinating. We parked at the Boston Visitor Center and rode south. This is a scenic route along the river and canal. We ride road bikes so there is a lot of rumbling spots, but also some good smooth areas as well. This is a great area for cycling.

The park offers a wide variety of trail surfaces and experiences, from dedicated asphalt bike paths to seldom-used foot paths leading to secluded scenes of nature's beauty. The park area near the SR 82 entrance and Nature Center was filled with visitors, but didn't feel at all crowded. After following an off-road path upstream, my companion and I wondered whether to keep biking forward, or to turn around. We were guided by the advice of two experienced hikers who we encountered, and returned to our cars without incident. In addition to trails, the park features at least one ball field and soccer pitch, numerous pavilions and rest areas, and par course exercise stations: an invigorating experience for any age and condition.","March 31, 2013","On-road or off, Brecksville Reservation bike trails are invigorating",62,"Kent, Ohio",5

While there are some beautiful sites, it seems more like a city park than a national park. It is also confusing to get around since there are houses and business in between park areas. Brandywine Falls were very pretty and it was a nice hike through the woods to get there. The beaver dam was interesting as well.

This is however a very nice respite in the wilderness should you find yourself in Cleveland. There were a few sections of the park that were more than worth the time to visit, the first was the Ledges section which has some very cool rock formations and a (closed year round now) bat cave. The beaver marsh was also a delightful experience, the best part of this section aside from its natural beauty was the power of nature to restore something back to a more natural state. The park also includes sections of the Erie Ohio Canal which was a fun history lesson to learn about as you ran into the locks that were used from 1827-1913. Though I didn't take a ride of the train in the valley, it would be the highlight would kids been traveling with me. I would be sure to do this ride as a fun way to experience the park.If at all possible to plan your visit, you would do well to do it in the summer or fall, when the park is in full color and life.

Last summer I road the Ohio and Erie Towpath Trail from the beginning in Cleveland to downtown Akron only to discover how incredibly beautiful this part of the country really is! I was blown away it was so awesome! The Ohio and Erie Towpath Trail draws most of the people to the park now a days but try checking out Tinkers Creek Gorge, Ledges, or many other trails. After a heavy rain in early spring or fall go see the water cascade over Brandywine or Bridal Veil Falls! We took some visiting friends to see these falls last fall after some heavy rains and it was an incredible experience! If you have young kids or grand kids try a visit to Hale Farm when they offer some special program. In the winter go skiing at Boston Mills or Brandwine Ski Resorts! If you want to do a short Sunday hike, try hiking the portion of the trail near Beaver Marsh. In late November we hiked Deep Lock Quarry and down the Towpath to Penisula. It was a great experience! Don't limit your experience just to the north. Try riding or walking the newly finished Towpath south of Barberton to Canal Fulton, or to Massillon; or try parking at John Glenn Grove in Navarre and bike to Bolivar.

We saw quite a few dear including an 8-point buck who stood about 10-15 feet from us and didn't flinch. The park gives some great views from the overlooks and if you follow trails along creeks you get great views of bubbling brooks and rapids. We visited during a period where it was raining and the river was really moving quickly through the park, which made the waterfalls even more lively. Viaduct park was pretty neat also. There stands some old remnants of the first industry in the area and you can invision what the area must have been like 150 years ago. At the same area of the Viaduct park are the great falls, which were pretty impressive. You can feel the earth shake when you stand close enough to it. We also visited the Beaver Marsh which was pretty neat and you can see signs of beavers at work, though we did not actually see them, but it was pretty even in the pouring down rain.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We spent a long weekend exploring Cuyahoga National Park (between Cleveland and Akron). This is the first National Park I've visited where you hear a lot of road noise. Major highways run over and around the park. Consistently travelled local roads run through the Park. In the beginning, this was a turnoff but after a few hours I didn't seem to notice as much. The Park has beautiful trails for hiking and biking. This is the first National Park I've visited where dogs are welcome on the trails -- I wished I'd known that ahead of time. There is an excellent option where bike riders with their bikes can hop the CVSR train for $2 and get dropped off at a distant train stop to ride the trail back to their cars. Interesting history on the Ohio canal. Cool waterfalls. The Farmers Market at Howe Meadow on Saturday morning was the BEST market I visited this year. We brought home apples, potatoes, zucchini, squash, raspberries, tomatoes, and goat's cheese. Yum! Yum! Yum!

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"So many place to see in the park. I was only there for three hours but had a wonderful time.Entered via Steels Corners Rd, off route 8, which made access easy. Passed Blossom Music Center where the renowned Cleveland Orchestra was getting ready to perform on a perfect summer day. Stopped at the Hunt Farm Visitor Information Center where the volunteer provided answers to all my questions and pointed out the free posters with several scenes of the park. Frolicked in the grass at Goatfeathers Point Farm then continued to Virginia Kendall Park, as a trail walk amongst tall trees was what I came for. Went to the Octagon section first. A steep trail to the ledges overlook was passed up (due to leg injury) for a leisurely trail walk under a canopy of several species of trees. It even drizzled a little but we kept dry because of the trees. The walk was fantastic! Mushrooms, squirrels, different varieties of rocks. We then drove to the ledges area. A walk across a lovely meadow, after a picnic lunch, to the overlook, which provided an amazing view of the Cuyahoga Valley. I can only imagine this view when the autumn leaves are in full color. (note - for other visitors not able to climb the trail from the Octagon area to the Overlook, the trail from the Ledges section is flat.) Picnic tables and old fashioned grills dot the park in secluded places. Visitors did not intruded in any way on our walks. Quite private and peaceful. Restroom at the ledges was tiled with toilets (not latrines.) Plenty of parking. And admission to this wonderful place is FREE! I highly recommend and will certainly come back.

And the people you meet along the way are the friendliest you will meet. You can run, bike or walk. The tow path itself is flat and smooth but there are many hiking trails off of it. The tow path runs along the old Erie canal that you learned about in history. The ""tow"" path is where the mules pulled the boats. Some of the old locks are still there and you can see the old canal for most of the path. There is a train that runs for part of it.

So plan on some time if you are doing it.There's historical houses, locks to admire, hiking and biking, fishing, skiing. etc. I think there's 120 miles to hike. We took short hikes to marshes and beaver lodges and another 1.5 miles to admire a waterfall. We hike often and our kids are really used to it. Our 3-year-old was a little tired though so keep ages and your own physical fitness in mind.I was amazed at the number of bicyclists. It seems its a park that is really used by near-by residents.

It's about 20 miles south of Cleveland and covers sprawling pastures, hills, rivers, canals and lakes from Brecksville to Akron and Richfield to Boston Mills. Within this sizable park you'll find dramatic rock formations and ledges left by glaciers thousands of years ago, the Eire Canal (President James Garfield worked as a mule boy along this canal 150 years ago) and towpath - great for biking and hiking, historic Boston Mills depot built in 1836 to service the canal, a scenic railroad line that takes you through the park, bald eagle and perigrine falcon nests, one of the last original covered bridges, a dramatic waterfall called Brandywine Falls, historic Hale Farm and Village -- a recreated village from the 1820's with blacksmiths and glassblowers and re-enactors, two ski resorts, the winding Cuyahoga River and miles and miles of beautiful hiking and biking trails. It is incredibly beautiful and never crowded.

However, given its location close to urban america - it is worth spending a day or two. I just hope that people don't come here for a first national park visit and be turned off - for there is much more that the national parks offer!It is definitely a park set up for bike riding, however, we did not have our bikes nor the time to rent them. So, we did several smaller hikes. All were very nice, and it was not crowded on a Sunday in August. Our 6-7 hour visit included Brandywine Falls, Blue Hen Falls, the figure-8 Happy Days/Ledges, Daffodil, Brushwood Lake (we ran at Daffodil and Brushwood Lake...part of the Metro Parks division), the Peninsula Depot Visitor Center, and Boston Store Visitor Center.The train system was very interesting, but we just didn't have the time. The bikepath mirrors the train tracks and river, so I do think that would be very fun and good way to see the park.If you are traveling accross the states to visit this park, I would suggest to tie in some other attractions in the area (we did some things in south-west Pennsylvania and north West Virginia).

My kids noticed stairs and asked if they could go up them. The ranger told us that there was an informational video about the park that we could watch up there if we liked. We needed more time in the air conditioning so we went for it. It was only about 10 minutes long and I would defintiely recommend it for school-aged children and up. The video is particularly informative about the creation of the park system and how important it is not just for those who ive in the are but for America in general.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"This was a nice weekend getaway for us, One of the two national parks near the East coast, and where we could drive to without losing the entire day. Of course, this is probably the most underwhelming of all the national parks in the country (mind you, I have been to only two and just seen pictures of the rest !). Still, it provides some nice hikes (the Ledges trail is a must do here), and a wonderful biking route following the Cuyahoga river. If you have your own bike, you can ride as far as you wish and then take the scenic railroad back (tickets are $2 if you have a bike, $17 if you do not !!). If you rent, on the other hand,as we did, then you have to meticulously plan your schedule to catch the train. Otherwise, you can end up paying quite a bit since rentals are $9/hr. There are a couple of quaint little towns here, and we happened to run into an enjoyable farmer's market in Peninsula, OH on a beautiful day. Also, it is really close to Cleveland.

The park is of an ""open"" design, meaning there are lots of country homes and small towns ""grandfathered"" into the park.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"When we first read about the park, we wondered... ""Outside of Cleveland???? Really?"" We made a plan based on the 40+ miles of bike paths and were thrilled with how the park, nestled between Cleveland and Akron, could offer so much escapism surrounded by so much modernity. The bike paths - with hardly an incline, were a mix of pavement, crushed gravel, along with short sections of boardwalk. The path runs more or less parallel to the river, train rails and a little further down, the road. Yet, for the majority of the miles, you hear nothing except for the call of the birds or the flow of water.We also chose to do a few short hikes - Brandywine Falls, Ledges, and Blue Hen Falls. Ledges offered up a nice dense forest along with some neat rock formations.All in all, despite not having 1 BIG sight to see, this is a must visit park, particularly for those in the Midwest. Being from Chicago, I'm quite jealous of the Buckeyes for this. Riding up and down the paths you'll run across a good number of different birds along with other assorted wildlife. The small town of Peninsula, about 2.5 miles, on the bike path, south of the Boston Mills Visitor Center offered up some food, drinks, as well as a bike store which rented bikes if needed.The only reason it's not 5 stars was that a lack of proper signs around the park made finding some of the destinations (Visitor Centers, etc.) a bit challenging to find once we were in the vicinity.

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We didn't even know this park existed! We were visiting friends in Akron and had a day to kill, and discovered we were nearly in the midst of a National Park. It's actually very decentralized and confusing. The park properties seem intermixed with the local MetroPark properties; there are a lot of non-contiguous sites. But the park is free, and we easily found fun things to see to fill our day. We enjoyed the following: (1) Brandywine Falls is a pleasant waterfalls that is quite impressive (for the area) and requires only a minimum of walking. The parking lot was being reworked when we were there and quite muddy. (2) Deep Lock Quarry was interesting but not spectacular; we enjoyed walking along the towpath here and looking at the river, which had enough rapids to make it worthy of whitewater canoeing. We asked a ranger about canoeing and he said no -- the bacteria levels are too high. (3) The Ledges Trail in the Virgina Kendall area of the park was excellent. It's lots of fun to wander in and out of the rock formations at the Ice Box Cave portion of the trail; both kids and adults should like this. But we found the Overlook section of the trail underwhelming.","October 18, 2011",Stumbled upon it,51,"Austin, Texas",5
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Who knew there was a National Park between Cleveland and Akron. The locals know about this park and it is well attended, but outside of Ohio, it is almost a secret.There are several visitor centers. Stop at one before exploring the park. The park map helps a lot. The rangers can offer suggestions to help you pick the best trails and sights. Our favorites were the Ledges and Cross-country Trails, Brandywine Falls and the Tinker Gorge Drive.","October 13, 2011",Hidden Gem,65,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",5
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,I go into the park from SR8 and look for the leaves for photos. A short walk down any of the trails and I find places to watch. The crowds can get a little heavy at times but never like the Grand Canyon in the summer. The deer gets bad in the evenings and nights through the fall and winter. I drive through the park couple times a week at night and the deer are everywhere,"October 7, 2011",Looking forward to the fall colors,38,"Mogadore, Ohio",4
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"My husband and I were visiting in Akron , Ohio and had a few hours to spare so were able to take time out to hike the old Erie Canal trail in Cuyahoga Valley National Park. There were many people out biking , walking and jogging. I'm sure they were taking advantage of the beautiful day. The park's trails were nice but a bit crowded on a Sunday afternoon. There was construction going on so it was hard to get to the trail head.","September 22, 2011",Hiking trails in Cuyahoga Valley Park,70,"O'Brien, FL",3
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"I love the National Park system, but this park was spread out in a town and at some points it became hard to tell if you were in the national park or just the town's park. Over all I had a great experience. I wouldn't spend all day here though and I'm glad we had other things on the agenda to do!","September 15, 2011",Waterfalls are beautiful,32,"Fort Collins, Colorado",3
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"I was staying in Independence, OH for business and decided to spend an evening after work in this National Park. It wasn't what I was expecting for a National Park, but I loved it just the same. It was great to instantly leave the larger suburb and then be in a park with a ton of hiking and biking trails. The history is interesting - it was an effort by residence of the small towns to prevent the urban sprawl so there are residential houses in the park and small country towns. Lots of history about the Ohio & Erie Canal that ran through there. Lots of conservation efforts. A great mixture of county parks that are also within the boundaries. 4 different visitor centers with passport stamps. I drove along the main road from north to south. It was in the evening so I had about 3 hours before it got dark. I stopped for a couple of short walks to some falls. Brandywine Falls was very nice. I drove back on the other side of the park and stopped to see some blue heron nests up in the tall trees. As mentioned, I was there for about 3 hours just doing a driving tour with short stops. I even had homemade ice cream at the historic market as I had forgotten to bring food and snacks with me. I would say if you were visiting from out of town and were actually going to stop and go on the trails, I would want to spend about 8 hours between hiking and driving. As it was though, I would have liked an extra couple of hours to go on more short hikes. Also the visitor centers were all closed while I was there which would have been more time spent looking at the displays.","September 12, 2011",Impressive Joint effort between National and County Parks,8,"Saint Louis, Missouri",4
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"We were staying in a hotel nearby and decide to come. It wasn't worth it. The trails were not labeled, and they had no signs leading you to them. Once we got to the trails we enjoyed them. There are many houses and towns in the park. The road system was very confusing. It does not feel like a national park. I wouldn't call it a state park either. This is the worst national park I have been to.","August 13, 2011",Very hard to find the trails,151,"Reading, Pennsylvania",2
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,If you are in Ohio and would like to hike some nice trails in the NE Ohio this is a great place. The Brandywine Falls are gorgeous. I have lived in Ohio all my life and just visited. Never even heard of it before. It is cool to visit if you live pretty close or are here anyway and are just dying to get out on some trails. Also perhaps you have a bucket list of National Parks to get through. Its cool but not awesome. We will take what we can get in Ohio. The visitor center at Boston Store is nice and there is an ice cream shoppe.,"August 11, 2011",Nice Park for Hiking and Biking,152,"Marysville, Ohio",3
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"I surprised my wife in October during foliage season to go to Cuyahoga Valley. One of her goals is to hit as many national parks as possible, and this one is the closest to our house. I thought the park would be scenic, and we set off for a 4 day weekend with a littel over 2 days in the park. Seeing the other trip advisor postings, I figured I knew what I was going to get.If you're looking for a Yellowstone, Yosemite, Acadia, Arches, etc. etc. etc. your'e not going to get that, and will be disappointed. The park though has some nice hiking trails, good ranger lead hikes, and some scenic views and waterfalls. I would rate it better than most state parks(in PA), but nothing like most of our other National parks.We drove about 7 hours to get there, and we had a good time. I think we would go back, but it's definitely something we would not go back to on a regular basis. It's a nice weekend trip(2-3 days in the park max) if your within driving distance or in the area, but definitely not a primary vacation destination.We also hit Falling Water on the way back home to eastern PA.","July 11, 2011","not National park standards, but nice long weekend trip",27,"Bethlehem, Pennsylvania",4
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"The Standford House primitive campsites are great -- there is good separation between sites, and they are beautiful and rather unique, with each site cut into the field of high grass, a perfectly neat and level spot to put your tent, with excellent privacy thanks to the tall grass surrounding your site. A Community fire ring provides great opportunities to meet fellow travellers. Minutes away from the Brandywine Falls trail, which is a nice easy hike, with great possibilities to encounter wildlife... We saw beavers and deer...The park also has some fun activities, including a the scenic trainride with an interesting historical audio tour...","January 1, 2011","beautiful location with great trails, excellent tent camping site...",27,new york / paris,5

Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"This National Park is quite large with many different hiking paths and other places to picnic and such. I was particularly looking for the Visitor Center. (I collect National Park Pass Stamps). I was disappointed that I could not locate it! I didn't have much time to find it, but the signage was not evident. Pretty park, though!","May 7, 2010",Where is the visitor center?,191,"Providence, Rhode Island",3
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Went to CVNP In April 2010. Hiked the Virginia Kendall Ledges trail, nice interesting hike, easy to moderate, enjoyable, cool rock formations, deer. Also checked out part the tow path, hope to return to bike a portion. Did not take the Scenic Railroad Train but it sounds like fun too. This Park is not a typical National Park with entrances (and fees) and specific borders; it blends with private property and public roads. This can sometimes cause a bit of confusion but the Park map is helpful in getting you to where you want to go. Simply driving through, there is not alot to see or scenic value other than nice woods, but it's great when you venture out onto the trails.","April 27, 2010",Enjoyed Hiking in CVNP,224,"Virginia Beach, Virginia",3
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"I don't know how anyone with a straight face can call this place a National Park. Seeing signs for it on my way out to the East Coast, I decided to spend a couple of hours (or rather I wasted a few hours) seeing the area. Well it's probably ok for a city or state park, but really this is nothing which puts this in the league of our other National Parks. This was formerly a National Recreation Area and it's doubtful it even qualifies as that. This was a waste of precious driving hours. But it's probably a thrill--for somebody in Ohio.","January 11, 2009",A National Park? You're kidding right?,30,"Minneapolis, MN",1
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"Visited two sites in Cuyahoga: the falls and the canal.The good news first: The falls are beautiful and, if you're in the area, are definitely worth a short drive. There are two viewing stations - an upper and a lower. The upper doesn't require as many stairs, but the lower offers a prettier view of the falls.The bad news next: The canal area was quite a disappointment, though it may have just been my family's lack of understanding what we would see. The canal was so very small and, while the info at the visitor center helped you to grasp what the canal actually meant to the area in its heyday, it's just not enough to inspire.If you're in the area and you have an extra hour or so, Cuyahoga -- especially the falls area -- isn't a bad investment, but I wouldn't make a special trip.","July 25, 2007",Only If You're in the Area with Time to Burn,131,"Huntsville, Alabama",2
Cuyahoga Valley National Park,"If you are not from northeastern Ohio or West Pennsylvania, then save the effort. Driving down from Connecticut was a mistake.This place is beautiful - no question about it. But it would probably have been justified if it was made into a State Park. It is right in the middle of a very urban area (Akron-Cleveland), and there is no boundary for the park. The scenic drive takes you through the backyards of residential houses and under interstate roads. Half of the people you see in this area are here on business (people actually on business, or people just crossing the roads on the way to somewhere else). There are restaurants, bike renters etc. on the roads - and traffic lights.What I am trying to say is that it does not give you the mood of being in a ""National Park"". It is good for a picnic, or a few nice strolls, or just spending a casual afternoon. But it is never a tourist spot - not worth driving more than 2 hours.I was actually disappointed for a different reason, too. So far, the 15 national parks (east and west coast) I have visited have all been great experiences for me. However, with this trip, that benchmark has been shaken. Now, I don't think I shall blindly be able to plan to visit a place just because it is a national park.","April 18, 2005",Save the effort,276,"South Windsor, Connecticut",1
