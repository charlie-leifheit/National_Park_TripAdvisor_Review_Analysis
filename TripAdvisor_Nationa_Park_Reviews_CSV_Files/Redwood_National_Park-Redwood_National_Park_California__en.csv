Redwood National Park,Our visit to Redwood National Park was beyond belief. We never stopped being amazed by the shear beauty and magnificence of the park and the breathtaking trees. Never mind the incredible size of them just walking among them is magical. The trees and the beauty that surrounds them capture your heart and soul and you will never be the same.,"October 18, 2019",Enchanting,116,,5
Redwood National Park,People kept saying it was breath-taking and not to miss on our drive out West but I kept thinking maybe they were exaggerating. Oh no they weren’t do not miss this if driving out this way!!! And get out and take a hike—even if its one of the shorter ones (you can find easy trails that will take less than 30 minutes to hike).,"October 17, 2019","I could not stop saying “wow, oh wow!!!”",31,"Singapore, Singapore",5
Redwood National Park,There are many great trails in this park. Many great trails start from the Prairie Creek visitors centre. You can decide on the hike based on your time and ability. Our only regret with the hike we chose is that we didn't allow enough time in our itinerary to take a longer hike.,"October 15, 2019",You need to take a hike in this Park.,4,"Sydney, Australia",4
Redwood National Park,We did a day trip.very peaceful and you can hike a lot or not.. I think everyone should experience this beautiful place at least once in a lifetime. These trees are truly a wonder!,"October 14, 2019",day Trip with the giants,0,,5
Redwood National Park,"We travelled from Sfo took 6 hours. We had started very early and we reached around 9.30 .Spend some quality time walking through the giants . The feeing is unique . It makes you feel how small are we . We are accompanied by a one and half year old . We stayed in Eureka. While driving back came through the avenue of giants which is must . It is a auto tour , you just drive through the 31 miles . Will definitely go there again. ","September 28, 2019",It is a long drive but is worth,3,,5
Redwood National Park,"Redwood National Park is along Route 101, but there are state parks that sandwich it on either side, too. Frankly, who cares if a mammoth tree is in a state or national park, right? I've never been intimidated by a tree until I saw these. They are almost spooky in their size and while a lot of nature doesn't phase my 20-year-old daughter, she was taken aback by their presence. Route 101 can be a real beast and if I never drive it again, I'll shed no tears, but this should be as high up as places like Grand Canyon or Mount Rushmore on people's bucket lists as attractions to see.","September 28, 2019",Not sure where the park starts or ends,12,"Auburn, Maine",5
Redwood National Park,"In mid September, we flew into San Francisco airport, rented a car and drove up to Trinidad, California where we stayed 4 days while visiting the Redwoods. The Redwood National Park and surrounding areas were amazing. We traveled on Rt. 101 . The scenic drive through the Redwood National Park was very nice. We could pull off and hike trails. Bring an umbrella or poncho. It rained off and on several times a day.","September 28, 2019",Amazing Redwood Trees,50,"Fairfax, Virginia",5
Redwood National Park,Among the things I have to see: the tallest trees in the world. This definitely exceeded my expectations. A beautiful place and a stunning view you feel so small in that forest. One sure thing...humans will never be able to create as beautiful things as nature does. We definitely have to protect it. That's the only thing we can do ,"September 24, 2019",One check on my dream list.,1846,"Neuchatel, Switzerland",5
Redwood National Park,"We found it a little difficult to figure out exactly where to go to best see the redwoods, as there are several different places. We stayed at the Hampton Inn in Arcata, CA. We were limited on time (24 hours!), so we visited a beautiful park right next to the Sequoia Zoo. The park is called Sequoia Park. You can drive right up to the entrance and easily walk to see the giants! This park is a hidden gem and not to be missed if you're short on time. We also drove down to see the Avenue of the Giants. It was gorgeous, and as expected incredible to see.","September 21, 2019",Must see!,7,"Nashville, TN",5

Redwood National Park,"Redwood National Park in California is one of the most well-known of the parks and not just for being the only place on Earth that you can find coast redwood trees.The park has so much more to offer and is home to a string of forests, beaches, and grasslands, giving it’s visitors diverse scenery and activities. I wouldn't hesitate to put this National Park among my Top 5 in America. ","September 6, 2019",One of the best experiences of your Lifetime ,142,"Rishikesh, India",5
Redwood National Park,It was so cool to see such LARGE trees....everywhere. We also got to see Roosevelt Elk right as we entered the park. Plenty of places to pull over and walk thru parts of the forest at your own pace - flat level ground for the most part - lots of places to take memorable pictures. Also there is no admission charge for this national park.,"September 3, 2019",Amazing!!!,3,United States,5

Walking in this forest gives you the sensation that you are walking by wise giants full of life and history.Views roads all is breathtaking....absolutely recommended.,"September 1, 2019",Magic forest,0,,5
Redwood National Park,"This enchanted place needs to be seen, and hiked in, to be believed. The trees are so massive, the forest so green and dense, that you can easily imagine you have left the 21st century entirely. Nature produces shapes and postures here, both giant and miniature, that effortlessly surpass the work of any human hand. So park your car. Set off down a trail. And slowly fall into the quiet, timeless, welcoming arms of the earth itself.","August 28, 2019",Words and pictures cannot capture the splendor,125,"Boston, Massachusetts",5

Redwood National Park,"Really enjoyed the park and all the associated state parks. You can see a lot in a day or keep busy for a week in the area. I think 3 days would be perfect - we stayed two days.Klamath is where we stayed and it is centrally located.Lots of great drives, hikes and photo stops in this incredible place.","August 26, 2019",Beautiful park with something for everyone,457,"Agoura Hills, California",5
Redwood National Park,"Redwood NP is a gorgeous place to visit for both hiking and scenic view. Similar to Sequoia NP with giant trees but different in term of ocean, rivers, lagoons and creeks everywhere.I highly recommend visitors to fly in San Francisco (SFO), rent a car and drive up to Redwood NP via Route 101 (and 1). It’s the most beautiful scenic drive that you will not ever forget about. There are so many vista view points along the coastline that you can stop by to take an unforgettable pictures; however, there’s a beach called Glass Beach where you must stop by for a view of colorful sands on the beach. It comes with bluish, greenish, reddish, crystal clear tiny rocks mixing with the sands. Before reaching redwood NP you will see a sign of “drive through tree”. Don’t miss that! You will have an astonishing experience to drive through a giant tree with your car.There are so many places to visit while in redwood NP, but don’t forget to visit the High Bluffs view point and the Coastal Drive (just right after visiting the High Bluffs). There’s also a place called “Mystery tree “ along the drive that you must visit. Hope you guys have a great time visiting there!","August 25, 2019",Redwood National Park ,15,"Huntington Beach, California",5
Redwood National Park,What amazing tress. You have no idea the scope of size of three trees until you are up close and personal. The mammoth size of these trees just blows you away. There is lots of hiking paths when it is not a rainy day.,"August 21, 2019",Large and Lovely,191,"Navarre, Florida",5
Redwood National Park,"It is hard to truly picture the magnitude of the trees until you see them in person. The drive is a bit long, as the trailhead is a bit remote. But, once you arrive, there is a lovely, easy hike around the trees. You’ll see trees on their side in areas. That really provides some perspective of how large they are. I’d give yourself around 45 minutes to 1 hour to explore the area, at a minimum. One suggestion, go to the restroom at the facilities along the highway prior to turning into the park as the restrooms at the trailhead are best left unvisited. I’ve been to other national parks where there is no plumbing in remote areas & it hasn’t been terrible, but this location has a reputation for a certain unpleasantness. Judging by the reaction from one of our friends, it lived up to its reputation that day.Overall, the redwood forest is something I think is worth seeing at least once. It is a nice place to relax & take in nature.","August 17, 2019",Lovely hike,80,"Fort Collins, Colorado",5
Redwood National Park,"We drove down to see the Redwoods today, but there isn’t all that much to see due to road construction and parking lots blocked off. There didn’t appear to be many hiking trails and the visitor center didn’t have any maps(?). Still, the trees are indeed magnificent and the drive down US 199 was spectacular.","August 6, 2019",Magnificent trees but not much else to see,102,"Benson, Arizona",3
Redwood National Park,"There is so much to see here but here is a brief:- The trees are larger than Sequoias. probably the most grandThat probably summarizes all of the park. The trees are towering over the skyline. If you're in a rush, then try the circle trail starting with the big tree for photographic spots and aesthetically pleasing locations. If you have more time, try the Foothill Path. There isn't much tourists here so you'll have the forest to yourself. If you have a day which is preferable, then visit the visitor center in the south and if you have kids, participate in the junior ranger program","August 4, 2019",Grand!,57,"Hong Kong, China",5
Redwood National Park,"We visited the Redwoods when we first moved to the PNW and now 2 1/2 years later we've decided to come back again and see some new parts the we weren't able to last time. On this visit to Redwoods National Park we went to Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park where we did the Brown Creek trail, Lady Bird Johnson Grove and went to see the Big Tree. Then we visited Fern Canyon this is one of the only areas that has a fee. I believe it was $8.Fern Canyon was made famous in Jurassic Park 2, it's literally a narrow canyon covered all over from top to bottom in ferns. I see why Spielberg chose it for filming.Do your research before you go since it can be closed due to the water levels. Plus make sure you have an off road vehicle for the drive to the trailhead I wouldn't want to do it in something that's not all wheel drive. Plan to wear active clothing and appropriate shoes. Your feet and ankles will most likely get wet. We visited in May and my DH and I got wet up to our ankles and maybe a little past that a couple of times. Most people use the logs to cross over and hike through the canyon, if you can't balance yourself perfectly on the precarious logs then you'll get wet. It was a lot of fun, but also be very careful. I wouldn't recommend it to very small children. This is a beautiful, stunningly gorgeous canyon. We're so happy to have been able to visit this wonderful natural beauty.We also went back to Jedidiah Smith Redwoods State park and did the stunning drive through it.We also stopped and hiked Stout Grove this time. We love our National and State parks they are so important to us and we will continue to visit them and protect them.","August 4, 2019",The Northern California Redwoods are Magnificent.,417,"Camas, Washington",5

Redwood National Park,"* Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park/Redwoods National Park* Turn on Davison Road/Elk Meadow/Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park/Redwood National Park-follow to Gold Bluffs Beach Campground /Fern Canyon Trail—Awesome Drive !!!!* The scenery changes dramatically when you turn onto this road. A 4 mile beautiful drive on a narrow, curvy, up hill road. There are beautiful blue/green ferns on either side of this road.Arrive at the ranger station for entrance fee. Then another 4 mile drive to the Fern Canyon trail. The campground entrance is along the way. You’ll have to ford a creek.Fern Canyon-FANTASTIC!! gorgeous, lush, green rocky, damp trail alongside a babbling creek. ( Be sure you have walking shoes) I could only go about 1/4 mile. We didn’t make it to the waterfall. The entire loop is 1.1 miles. Because I walk with a cane I was unable to complete the entire loop.

Redwood National Park,"Would you like to see giants redwoods, as tall, as wide and as big as can be? I have not seen so many Redwoods in my life. It’s hard to imagine that these majestic trees grow naturally and just received its nourishment from the Creator. Just wild nature. Beautiful drive from Oregon to California and I can not stop admiring Gods creation. To add to the fact that this is near the ocean. I can’t describe the feeling I have being close to nature away from the busy life. Very relaxing.

Redwood National Park,"We travelled along Hwy no 101 from Seattle to LA. Washington and Oregon have truly spectacular beaches. Not to talk about the magnificent redwood trees. The avenue of the giants was really somthing extra. Since 101 run through the park there is no admission fee. You just drive on and on looking up at the giants. Stopping here and there to take in the fact that these trees are huge. I strongly recommend to drive as long as possible on the smaller road, that run next to 101. The park is beautiful","July 23, 2019",How small we are,36,Sweden,5

Redwood National Park,"This is a just-see part of Northern CA! Beautiful scenery and quiet walks in the forest. Especially recommend the 1.5 no walk to the Ladybird Johnson Grove. Just crossing the footbridge alone is beautiful but all along the walkway you will see and br able to photograph all types of plants and trees that are enormous and really make you understand your place in creation! The grove itself is also scenic and the sense of tranquility really helped me to decompress and relax and forget about my hectic life for a while. Don't pass this up if you can spare the time. The drive is great itself, but get out and walk and really soak it in!!","July 11, 2019",Reconnect with nature here!,19,"Orange, California",5
Redwood National Park,"If you have never seen redwoods, then this is a great place to visit. The park is broken up into smaller parks that you need to drive between to see all of the sights.

Redwood National Park,"This park is all over the place. Man has destroyed 96% of the redwoods. So, there are groves here and there thanks to the actions, money, and deeds of many people. Thank goodness, these are protected. Meeting an old growth redwood cannot be described. It is truly awe inspiring. when there benches lay down and look up, it's amazing. The forests are also full of tiny flowers, slugs, snails, just wonderful.

Redwood National Park,"What not to like here.. We were stunned at how huge, old and giant these trees are! And the forest is abundant with easy access to hiking trails, state parks and KOA campgrounds. We drove around the forest stopping at view points to view wildlife and or hiking. We spotted many elks at the Elk view point and we were lucky to spot three brown bears happily munching on wild berries close to hiking trail.

Redwood National Park,"Yes, we've seen incredible redwood trees before. We've been to Muir woods and other parks around the Bay area. So we weren't sure if this was worth the trip. But it was. Seemingly endless groves of remarkable trees, and things to do.

Redwood National Park,"After spending a day and a half on a combination of route one and route101, by the time I got to the redwood forest I was completely out of adjectives and superlatives. Standing in the majesty of the place I understood that I was there simply by Gods Grace. It’s humbling to know that places like this exist with no help at all from the human hand. It makes you understand that what you consider a problem doesn’t measure on the scale of enormity at all. Look around, gather what friends and family you have and let your blessing pour down upon you as you enjoy one more day the Lord has provided for you. And as an added benefit, it’s great place to take a peaceful hike.","May 6, 2019",I’m all out of adjectives.,158,"Ottawa, Illinois",5

Redwood National Park,"We spent one full day exploring the Redwood National and State Parks between Crescent City and Garberville, focusing on the areas where there is wheelchair access. There are actually several parks in the Redwood National Park complex; the National Park Service and California State Parks are working together to protect the old-growth redwood groves and coastline in northwest California. [* Indicates attraction has a separate Tripadvisor page.]We started our day at the Hiouchi Information Center* on US Highway 199 at Jedediah Smith State Park* and picked up a map. The facility offers a short film about the redwoods and coastal environment and also a few educational displays. I asked the ranger on duty about the entrance fees for the park; we have NPS access passes, but would we have to pay day-use fees at each of the state parks? She explained that the state parks in the partnership accept the NPS passes, but there is no fee to drive through the parks- only to access developed areas like campgrounds or picnic areas. I was also told that a state park entrance fee would cover all the state parks visited on the same day (save tag/receipt) but since we have a pass we didn't test that procedure. Our first experience in the redwood forest was the Simpson-Reed Grove and Peterson Memorial Trail on Walker Road in Jedediah Smith State Park. These two adjoining trails are wide and level with a hard-packed surface graded for wheelchair use. The paths form a figure-8 loop leading about a mile through a dense, ferny forest of towering redwoods. We hiked it in the morning and savored the peace and solitude. After our walk, we drove south on US Highway 101 along the coast and were fortunate to see a herd of Roosevelt elk lounging near the roadway at Elk Valley. As the highway continues south, it passes through Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park* and there are overlooks, picnic areas and trails along the beach. We didn't spend much time there because it was cool and foggy.We turned off of US101 and took the scenic route on Newton B. Drury Parkway*, which winds 9 miles through meadows and redwood groves in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park*. There are several pull-outs for viewpoints and trail heads along the way. We stopped at the small visitor center near the south end of the parkway and hiked a 2.3 mile loop on the Prairie Creek, Foothill and Cathedral Trees Trails to the Big Tree Wayside. These trails follow a creek through the forest and are relatively level with a surface of hard-packed soil and wooden boardwalk. They were more heavily-trafficked than the first trail we visited. We successfully maneuvered a wheelchair on the loop, with assistance and care to avoid stones and roots in the path. There are additional trails in this area around the Prairie Creek Visitor Center that may also be passable by wheelchair. By then we were starving, so we continued our journey south on US101 and stopped at Trinidad for a seafood lunch. After we were refreshed, we drove the Avenue of the Giants* scenic byway through Humboldt Redwoods State Park* in the afternoon. The two-lane parkway follows the Eel River past several redwood groves and there are more opportunities for hiking, camping and picnicking. Because US101 passes through the park, the surrounding area seemed more developed with services and tourist attractions (i.e. drive-thru trees and treehouses) than the parks we visited earlier. We stopped at the large visitor center (about 1.5 mile south of Weott) to view the educational displays and purchase souvenir t-shirts. The volunteer staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful! We hiked the Gould Grove Nature Trail and Fleishmann Grove Trail located across the parkway from the visitor center. These trails meander along the Eel River through a more open, airy forest than the others we had visited in the morning. The distance was about 1.5 miles and the trail had a firm surface with a thin coating of leaves, mulch and needles. We were able to negotiate the wheelchair over these trails with assistance, as there were a few tricky spots where the trail narrowed or had a short grade. The Rockefeller Loop and Drury-Chaney Loop trails in Humboldt State Park are also described as wheelchair-accessible, but we didn't have enough time or energy left to try those. We had an pleasant, memorable adventure among the redwoods, and headed for our hotel in Garberville feeling pleased and grateful that the park service has made these majestic forests available to everyone.","April 24, 2019",Exploring the Redwood Forest on Wheels,1781,"Tucson, Arizona",4
Redwood National Park,I was told about Redwood as a child and knew it was supposed to be magnificent. Well it is more than that.

Many tourists miss the Newton Drury turn off - unfortunately the real Redwood Park sign is at the bottom of the offramp so many folks miss this outstanding scenic route which is also something of a short cut! Big Tree and the trail to Cathedral trees is an iconic hike in the best of the Redwood Habitat- takes you back to the age of the dinosaurs- multiple trailheads leave the narrow- tree lined road north of Big Tree for wonderful day hikes! Prairie Creek has great camp sites, the elk were in the prairie for our visit! No traffic- quiet majesty- and then north to sweeping ocean vistas!

Redwood National Park,just visit this national park with my kidos and what an amazing experience. I love big tall trees and have been to Sequoias twice now. This place is a bit further out for me but finally made it happen. It was a religious experience for me walking beneath these ancient giants. Luckily it was low season and so there was not many people. We did the Tall Tree Trail which require permit to get to the trail head. it is not a long hike just 1.4 miles to get down to the grove. The harder part was getting back because it is uphill but still was not bad since it is short. We also visited the Fern Canyon at a state park near by and that was amazing and different also. prepare to get a bit wet up to your ankle in Autumn on this hike and up to knee if you go in Spring. We were also able to see a bunch of Elks. That was way cool. We stayed in Trinidad which was only 25 minutes away and a charming seaside town. It has a bunch of restaurant and some nice beaches.

Redwood National Park,"Redwoods National and State Parks include Del Norte, Prairie Creek, Jedidiah Smith State Park, and Redwood National Park. We didn't see any distinct lines separating them. All were off Highway 101. We did lots of research before planning this trip and there are about a million things you could do but what we decided on was this: We stayed in Crescent City CA, which is just North of most of the mentioned areas. We started early in the morning driving south and took the Newton B Drury Scenic byway-which is a jaunt off the highway and loops back onto 101 further South. Off this route is the ""Big Tree Wayside"". Stop there. Once back on we drove south to Orick. We drove by Elk Prairie and Elk Meadow and into Ladybird Johnson Grove. We spotted a bear running across the road on our way in! So exciting! Here we parked and walked a loop. From there we headed North and drove Howland Hill Road in Jedidiah State Park from the south end to the northern end which ends in Crescent City. I was a little nervous after reading about this road because it is unpaved and it was rainy day. I am so glad we decided to go for it. It was absolutely the best thing we did on this trip. Go slow, watch for cars coming from both ways. The road is very narrow and there are parts where you may have to move over, or back up to let other cars by coming from the other direction. It was o worth it. Here, we walked through Stout Grove. There is a flat easy loop and other longer loops that branch off of it. We spent 1 day dedicated to the redwoods on our trip and I feel like we saw everything we wanted to. Stop at overlooks and waysides. Get out of the car and walk when you can.

Trailhead: Hwy 101, mile marker 16, a little over 9 miles south of Crescent City Harbor. We were there around 9am and mist and fog made the area feel majestic. Starting from around 1.7 mile, soil erosion compromises some parts of the trail, making them slippery and difficult to negotiate. There are two bridges along the trail. The second one has a sign that tells you trail beyond that point is closed due to bridge failure. People would carefully cross it anyway. If you turn around and hike back up, you would just miss the beach, and views of the coast but we didn't find the view any different from the rest of the California coasts.

Crazy how the weather changed about 100 miles south of the park--had been 105 driving up the valley, right until it...wasn't. Temp started falling about a degree per mile, felt awesome. We got to the park (Thomas Kuchel visitor's center) about 8:45 Am the next morning, right before it opened at 9:00. We wanted to get one of only 50 free vehicle passes they give out daily that allows you to drive down a closed access road (Tall Trees Access Rd), putting you right at the trail head of several trails. As we drove towards the access road on an old blacktop road, we rounded a corner and saw a 1-2 year old black bear walking down the road! He let us creep by, snapping our pics as we passed him--pretty cool! We were there on a Saturday in July, but the place was not crowded as we got there early; as we were finishing our hike several hours later, there was noticeably more people on the trail and it wasn't nearly as serene as during our hike. We hiked the Tall Trees trail, about 5 miles round trip, including the loop at the bottom near the river, 700 feet of elevation change each way...but just incredible. Words wouldn't due it justice.

The sign is a little misleading because you'd think you're supposed to look immediately off the road, but the trail starts a few yards from the sign and it is less than a 5 minute walk down to the tree.

Their maps clearly delineate easy, moderate, and strenuous trails. They even have Accessible trails. We were so impressed with the cleanliness of the park, the professionalism and friendliness of Park employees, and the variety of trails that allow you to immerse yourself in the Redwood habitat.

We started around 5 am morning from Sunnyvale and reach to national forest around 7 am morning. Road was awesome beautiful nature all around the road. it is hilly road and nice valleys, forest, Ranches . some are the good view points specially for sun rise and sun set. We pay the entry fee for per vehicle $10 by dropping the money in the envelope into drop box available outside the Visitor centers. Visitor center opens around 8 am. Therefore if you are reaching there before 8 am then you hav eto drop the fee before entering into the park to avoid the fine. There is a parking place around the Visitor center ( infornt as well as other side of road ). There is a map available online as well as inside the forest for various trail for hiking. nice views and nature .. nice, tall, big redwood trees. The major disappointment is nothing is available there to eat. you have to carry your own food. There is booking options online also for camping or overnight stay.. Very few slots are available. so if you are thinking over the weekend or long weekend during holiday time.. please book well in advance. but nice and must visit place for hikers and nature loving people.","April 10, 2018",Redwood National Forest,28,"Ujjain, India",5

Leggit Chandelier tree - a Tree that you get to drive through. Really fun tourist stop that takes less than 30 minutes2. Stopped at Curiosity hill just to take some fun funky pictures really neat twighlight zone type of spot3. Drove through the avenue of the giants as a short detour then got right back on the high way on the way to Eureka4. Staying in Eureka we ate at AA bar & grill. A bar that THE MOST AMAZING STEAKS. It is after all the only thing on the menu order a side of mac n cheese bites also they are amazing. Also checked out the main street shops, really cool used bookstore with hundreds of books from classic to new. Then checked out the wine spot for some after dinner wine. The place was classy and cozy. People were super friendly and the wine was delicious. 5. Drove to the redwoods taking newton Drury scenic Parkway to see Elk prairie. ALWAYS stop by the prairie creek visitor center to check out conditions and which trails may be closed. Get there early so you can do the most with your day. I recommend being there for 9 am at the latest. (we got there at 11 am and still were able to do all of this but if we would have gotten there earlier would have been able to check out another hike perhaps). 6. Hiked James Irvine trail (5 miles one way) and saw beautiful gorgeous views and sites. Plenty to see. This led to Fern Canyon and to the beach. Absolutely gorgeous hike that wasn't challenging. There are other hikes but I feel that this gave us the most for the time. 7. Drove to the high bluff overlook. Beautiful sunset view. Also drove to klamath cove which is also a gorgeous view. Both of these spots did not require much time but were breathtaking. Klamath cove is known for whale watching but you must bring binoculars and be patient. Done. You can add many more stops to your trip if you have more time. There are plenty of wineries on the way from san fran to eureka/redwoods so if you have time make some stops.","January 3, 2018",One night and one day in the redwoods,65,"Hazleton, Pennsylvania, United States",5

Redwood National Park,"One of the most beautiful places in the world is the forest of sequoia. It is called Redwood. These forests are located in California, in the USA. It is one of the oldest trees in the world. Some specimens are more than 3,5 thousand years old. In addition, it is one of the tallest trees in the world and one of the largest in diameter. Very often we can see charred at the base of a tree. There are many fires was in their lifetime, but they survived. The fire had burned out competitors of other types of trees and young growths. It has given more space for these trees. In California, Redwood is a wild forest protected by the state. These are just trails in the forest between huge trees. All trails have their levels of difficulty and any person know the length of the trail, the Lifting height, etc. All national parks in the USA and other countries are paid. It is not a pity spending money. Because for this money the staff support trails, maintain the state of parks. In Ukraine or Russian people understand a park as a well-groomed place most often creating by humans. National parks are placed of wild nature. Everybody can the opportunity to look at these places. But if you will not used trails it is very dangerous because you can meet a wild animals or you can lost in the forest on the large areas.If someone will be in California, you need to visit Yosemite (the oldest national park in the USA) and RedWood. This is a majestic sight. The power and age of these trees give us a feeling of a very short life. So this trees once again reminds us that we must live our short life worthy.","November 3, 2017",RedWood,7,"Kharkiv, Ukraine",5
Redwood National Park,"Impossible to convey the sensations while hiking these woods. For some Native Americans, these redwood forests have spiritual meaning. For us, it was like being in a Cathedral of Trees. We found old logging roads being restored to their natural state and some reasonably short and easy hiking trails.

Until you actually see the Redwoods in person, you cannot appreciate how tall these trees truly are. They are truly extraordinary. (Thank goodness for the vertical pano option on the iPhone!).At times, hiking in the groves, it felt like you had the whole trail to yourself. The perks of going in the off season. If you are short on time, Jedediah Smith and Prarie Creek are two areas of the park I would recommend focusing on. Lots of the old growth Redwoods are located there.

We had expected to arrive at a large/obvious national park entrance and know exactly where to go...that wasn't the case (which I know was dumb on our part). The park spans for many miles, so there are multiple areas to explore. What's great are all of the trails made to easily explore. If you are coming from Klamath, you just have to travel south a little ways down 101 and find the exit sign that references the park. Also, if you are coming from the north and your GPS takes you on a dirt/gravel road into the woods, TAKE IT (well, as long as you have a fairly sturdy vehicle).

I was able to walk some great trails surrounded by nothing but nature.","August 12, 2017",Amazing Beauty,5,,5
Redwood National Park,"We loved the redwoods! This park is a little different from the other national parks I have been to in that it also includes state parks and there is no entrance fee, so its free! We visited in July of 2016 and the weather was great. There are tide pools, and exploring them was really fun! Don't miss fern canyon, its in Gold Bluffs State Park. We saw lots of Roosevelt elk. When we walked through the redwood groves we had a good time looking for banana slugs. We had the best time and already want to go back!","August 9, 2017",Wonderful park!,146,"Dallas, Texas",5
Redwood National Park,"When you plan a trip to the Redwoods, you might not think about tide pools, but that was a big highlight for my kids. Go to Lagoon Creek during low tide to see lots of crabs, sea anemones, sea starts, and small fish. (Tide times are posted at most ranger stations.) Get a permit from one of the park's visitor centers so you can go to the Tall Trees Grove. (The park limits the number and size of vehicles that can access the road.) Plan on 4 hours to drive to the trailhead and go on the 4-mile hike. Unlike most national parks, several of the trails do allow mountain bikes.","August 7, 2017",One of my favorite places on Earth!,24,"Ogden, Utah",5

The ranger was very knowledgeable about the trees and the history of the area. Everything that has been written about the trees is correct. Just stunning and inspiring. Lots of big old growth trees. We then went to see the Stout Grove via US 199. We found the parking lot, if you can call it that, and took the trail into the grove. The trail from that side has its ups and downs, lots of tree roots and large cobbles. It is about 1/2 mile in length so not too long. Once there, the trees are amazing and it is so peaceful.

Redwood National Park,"I recently spent 4 days exploring the Elk Prairie section of the Redwoods, which is a set of both national and state parks. The information centers seem to be run by the National Park Service, while the campgrounds are run by the California State Parks. The scenic beauty was stunning, even in the rain. The mist and fog made the trees even more amazing, and added to the benefits of that redwood canopy above my head. This would be a great place to spend hot summer days too. The visitor center, both the main one a the southern coastal end of the park, and the one at Elk Prairie, were both wonderful, with great exhibits, and friendly, helpful and knowledgeable staff. My only negative was the campground host at the Elk Prairie campground. A man from one of the Carolina states, who openly stated that he hated California and all it's crazy laws and crazier people, and said that he couldn't wait for 6pm when he could started drinking ""a cold one"" even though he was on duty until 8pm, and was just a tad too friendly to the point of being creepy.

Redwood National Park,We traveled from Grant Pass OR to CA in late September which we covered all Redwood National Park. Redwood National Park is not just one park which is a combination of many state parks and there is no park entrance fee. The best way to explore this park not just only driving through it but also do some hiking. There are some short ( o.5 mile) to medium ( 2-3 miles) hikes which are not difficult to handle. To me the best part of Redwood is at Stout Grove (0.5 miles loop trail) which you can get to it from Cresent city or north entrance ( like us). But the road is narrow and with big holes. Do not forget to stop at visitor center which they will give you some ideal where to go. We drove through Newton B Duruy Park way ( you will see the biggest tree at this region) and went to Fern Canyon which you can do more hiking ( narrow road and curvy with big holes and string of water to get there also). At Prairie Creek ( before go to Fern Canyon) you will be able to see many many elks ( I saw at least 14 of them). At Humboldt Redwood you can drive through Ave of Giant. There are couple hiking trails. We hiked at the Chaney memorial Grove ( 2.4 miles) which is loved by local. At Ave of Giant you will able to see the tallest tree at this region. ,"December 15, 2016",Wow...,128,"New Providence, New Jersey",5

There doesn't seem to be much of a distinction between the national and state park.Another suggestion is to go to one of the park rangers office (in my case, Prairie Creek) and get suggestions as to which trails to hike. The rangers were extremely helpful in choosing trails that were fairly easy to hike and helped estimate the time of the hikes. I also took the Lady Bird Johnson Grove hike which was quite easy. The Cathedral Trees Trail is quite easy as well.It's also quite worth it to park your car on the Newton Drury Scenic Parkway.

Very peaceful short path (mile?) around the grove. Quietest place ever. Then we drove further down 101 to the main part of the park. First thing when we drove in, we saw a sign to watch for elk, less than 500 feet down the road, an elk was crossing the street. :D So, be careful. The animals seem to think they have the right of way :DThere is one main road through the park and places to pull off to venture into little trails on either side. Take some time to do this.

Redwood National Park,"It's truly hard to imagine before you get to Redwood National Park how mighty and massive a Redwood tree actually is, let alone a national forest which is full of them. Obviously being a protected nature reserve Redwood National Park is a bit out of the city limits. If you're staying in the city an Uber to Sausalito over the iconic Golden Gate Bridge takes you to the bus terminal where it's just $5 to shuttle up to the National Park (and $5 to get down). I looooovee how organised America is like that! Entrance is also only $10 and for a shared Uber, a shuttle and entrance fee (+-$40) a half day is spent in nature walking amongst I think one of the worlds last natural wonders. Relatively cheap for San Francisco. However being a natural wonder, crowds can get quite large and families with kids make a lot of noise. The only slight downside. So I'd try go early in the morning or a week day to avoid that. Besides that certainly worth seeing a spectacular specimens of nature.

We went to the avenue of the giants first and to another attraction near there.Don't get me wrong, the trees are amazing and its unbelievable beautiful, but since we had two babies with us we didn't really want to hike or camp; if you are going to do both this park should be great for you.I strongly suggest you get a map of the park before going, so you can plan ahead and if you are traveling from the park to Oregon and then to Nevada (like we did), fill up whenever you can while driving in Oregon; we didn't know there is a law that doesn't let you self serve the gas, somebody has to do it and some of the gas stations where closed and the pumps were locked (we were traveling by night).","September 30, 2016",Get a map of the park!,31,Wyoming,3

Redwood National Park,"This is the only National Park of the 25 I have visited that I found confusing !! Jointly run by California State Parks and over a large area bisected by HWY 101 it would be very easy to miss some sections. The visitor centre's are in different locations and only relevant to where they are situated I was glad we stopped at the information centre in Crescent City first if not we would have missed a lot of the beautiful spots to visit because they are not apparent on the general map. The lady there also told us that the main scenic drive through the main section was closed for construction which otherwise we would not have known about, I had looked at the NPS website the evening before and this info did not flag up. Do not let this put you off as these trees and the coastline are magnificent, but if travelling from North to South DO stop at the centre in Crescent city first, it's well signposted.","September 28, 2016",Confusing,137,"Bury, United Kingdom",4

Redwood National Park,"I arrived at this park via the Redwood Highway from Grants Pass, OR down into Crescent City, CA. The drive was about three hours or so and it was very scenic. The Redwood Park is just into Northern CA, and there are many places to stop. The trees became larger and larger as we entered the area of the park. As a resident of the east coast, the size of the trees was surreal. I visited Stout Memorial Grove that was locally recommended and was located off the main road, down a dirt road and then eventually a parking lot emerged. It was so quiet and peaceful. The trees were so large I was in awe. It was beautiful!","September 17, 2016","Rural, Beautiful, Unforgettable!",10,"Burlington, North Carolina",5
Redwood National Park,This elongated national park is also a state park. We enjoyed driving through the tall redwoods. But even more special was the lookout over the Pacific--turn left on Requa Road and go up the hill past the Requa Inn.

Redwood National Park,"We visited Redwood National Park as part of a trip in which we visited Lassen, Oregon Caves, Crater Lake, and Lava Beds National Parks. Redwood National Park is a beautiful Park preserving amazing Groves of Redwood trees. There are three visitor centers, of which the southernmost one seems to be the largest and most developed. This park is a combination of national Park and Jedidiah State Park to the north. The drive through the park on the Newton B Drury Parkway is very beautiful. One of the most fun areas to go involves going down the gravel Davison Road past Gold Bluffs Beach to Fern Canyon - which is amazing. Your car will get very dusty. The beach here is wide open without rocks or tide pools. There is a herd of elk that frequent this area. The park is made up of northern and southern sections. What is amazing to me is how little there is in the way of support services. The nicest lodging is in Klamath which is a Holiday Inn Express that is brand new. There are some smaller older hotels and motels scattered around. Otherwise you have to go 30 miles south to Arcata or 20 miles north to Crescent City. There is no food service in the Visitor Centers or in the parks. In the southern section, your options are in Orick consisting of of a deli in the small store, the Snack Shack and The Palm restaurant, both of which serve casual type food and are good and kid friendly. Beyond that, you have to go to Klamath or as far north as Crescent City before you can find lodging or restaurants. This was surprising to me when you compare this historic and nationally known Park to the other great California parks such as Sequoia, Yosemite, Death Valley and the others which are much better developed with lodging, restaurants and support services. That is the only reason I gave this a 4 out of 5 as it seems like California kind of forgot about this park. Redwood National Park has very nice hiking trails although surprisingly few short family friendly hikes considering the size of the park. The drives through the park are very nice with lots of places to pull over. It is also great that you have such a variety of environments to visit from Coastal beaches and tide pools to the mountainside Redwood Groves and valleys in between. It is also important to remember that in the summer, your views of the ocean are going to be very limited due to the dense fog banks. In the northern section of the park, which is part of Jedediah State Park, Howland Road is an unpaved beautiful road that runs through the Redwood Groves in that area and I highly recommend driving it. Again your car will get very dusty but you will enjoy the drive. Crescent City is also near this area and has numerous lodging and restaurants including fast food chains. Redwood National Park is a beautiful park with tremendous potential and great history. I hope that more will be done to develop this resource so that even more people can enjoy this. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit.","September 14, 2016","Beautiful park, surprisingly undeveloped",153,"De Soto, Missouri",4

It doesn't take too long, nor is it too short. The weather was a little cool so be sure to bring a jacket. The employees we met were friendly. There weren't many there because there were parts of the site that weren't operating the day we were there. The bookstore/souvenir shop was open. Be sure to scratch the guard kitty under the neck when you check out. Prices in the store were normal souvenir prices, a little high. The food we purchased was tasty but expensive. The menu was more extensive than most places like this. You can wander around and look at the site at your leisure and there are plenty of photo opportunities available.

Pick up a map and see the film at one of the visitor centers first. Even the roads through the parks are scenic. Get out of the car and walk amongst these majestic trees. There is nothing like them.

Redwood National Park,We visited the Redwoods National Park today by first going to the Kuchel Visitor Centre. The park rangers are so friendly and have so much knowledge about the local area. The ranger gave us a map and advised us of the best trails for us. We drove up to the Prairie Creek Visitor Centre after this as this is where the starting point was for our walk. We started on the Prairie Creek trail and cut across the Zig Zag #1 trail. The Zig Zag trail is only half a mile but wow was it a good workout! We walked for around 5-6 miles and it took us about 3 1/2 hours. The Redwoods are just amazing and no picture can show just how fantastic the scenery is. There are many scenic drives to do also that take you by the coast or through the prairie's. The best advice I can give is to visit a visitor centre and also to look out for wild elks on the side of the road!,"September 5, 2016",Amazing scenery! ,4,,5
Redwood National Park,"It's a loooong drive out there but totally worth it. After braving the overly assertive California drivers and passive aggressive Northern California locals one should go to any and every national and state park with the Redwoods label. They are all located too far from major population centers to be weekend trip worthy so over crowding is not an issue. Feel free to stay in Eureka or Crescent City if need a place to regroup, though the locals are not the warm and inviting sort. A nice place to start would be Ladybird Johnson Grove just north of Orick.","September 1, 2016",Beautiful place!,19,,5

Gave us greater understanding and appreciation. We walked the Lady Bird Johnson Grove trail. It was a little over a mile long and took us 3 hours--it was that awe inspiring. We two Midwesterners simply couldn't stop being amazed. My husband actually brought along a tape measure, but our brains simply couldn't comprehend the numbers. Wow, wow, wow.

There is incredibly peaceful splendor here. Camping here is a religious experience. The Roosevelt Elk herd that lives here is a joy to observe and photograph. The fern canyon over on the beach side is lovely. But the wonder of it all is when you walk only a few feet into the forest on one of the many trails. You don't really have to go more than a few feet into the forest to experience it. Just walk in a sit down. Perhaps near one of the streams or up the side of one of the hilly parts. You are deep in the most beautiful setting on earth. The trees and the carpet of ferns are breathtaking! Be careful not to step on any of the very slow moving local banana slugs. They enjoy the peacefulness too. Whenever I have been deeply troubled in my life, I have taken time away to come to this hauntingly lovely place and find a new direction in my live.

Redwood National Park,"Even if you have visited Muir Woods and Sequoia National Park, Redwood is worth a visit. This park is a cooperative effort between the State of California and The U.S. Government, spanning 176 sq. mi. near the Northern coast of California. There is a visitor's center (Kuchel Visitor's Center) along Hwy 101 near the Southern end of the park before (West of) Orick, and one a little further north (Prarie Creek Visitor's Center). Park Headquarters are located in Crescent City, CA at 2nd and K streets. We visited both Kuchel and the Park Headquarters, and found both facilites to be informative and the staff helpful.While this is mostly a hiking park, we enjoyed Ranger-led talks and walks at Lady Bird Johnson Grove near Orick off Hwy 101, and Simpson Reed Grove at the far northern end of the park near Crescent City, Ca, off Hwy 199. We also drove The Newton B. Drury Scenic Parkway that parallels Hwy 101 for 10 stunning miles. There are a total of 8 scenic drives within the park, 3 of which are fully paved.The introductory film at the visitor's center was very informative and ran about 20 minutes.They offer a number of Junior Ranger Programs for your children.

Redwood National Park,"This is not a traditional national park, with an easily-identifiable entrance to a single natural area. Instead, it is a federal-state lash-up that offers access to many different, non-contiguous areas with redwood stands and rugged beaches. So it can be hard to figure out where to go and what to see. If you have limited time, as we did, here are recommendations for HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR VISIT.1. Start with maps and advice at a VISITOR CENTER. If traveling north-to-south, you've got 2 choices: The Hiouchi Information Center on the far side of Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, just off Hwy. 101 on Route 127; or the Park Headquarters Information Center at 2nd and K Streets in Crescent City. If traveling south-to-north, you also have 2 choices: The Kuchel Visitor Center on Hwy. 101 near Orick; or Prairie Creek State Park Visitor Center on the Newton B. Drury Scenic Parkway.2. Even if you have to wait in line at the center, TALK WITH A RANGER about your specific interests, the amount of time you have, and the distance you want to walk or drive. He or she will quickly develop a PERSONALIZED PLAN and give you both the maps and the advice that you will need to accomplish your goals.We stopped at Kuchel Visitor Center because we wanted to re-visit the nearby beach that we'd enjoyed long ago. We also wanted to see some of the biggest, oldest redwoods and, if possible, to walk through an entire grove of giants. The ranger sent us north past Elk Creek campground (where we saw a herd of grazing elk) to Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park.There we saw the ""THE BIG TREE,"" 304 ft. tall, 21.6 ft. wide, 1500 years old. And there we walked the short ""CATHEDRAL TREES TRAIL,"" shaded by giants in many different stages of life, with beautiful wildflowers and wildlife to make it all the more impressive. Both experiences were splendidly memorable, and so we made the best use of our limited time.3. CAUTIONS. If you're thinking you don't need a ranger's advice because you have a map or a brochure in hand, think again. One trail that we had considered taking was closed, due to storm damage. The road we would have driven, investing a considerable amount of time to get there, was washed out and would have been dangerous to attempt, had we been so foolish.Conditions in the wilder parts of northern California can change rapidly due to weather or fire. So it's sensible to get a green light from the people-in-the-know before heading off on a dirt road or a trail.We had a great day, as you'll see if you look at the pictures I've attached. Good luck, and enjoy your visit.","August 14, 2016",How to Get the Most Out of a Short Visit,644,"Montpelier, Vermont",5

Be advised! If you want to see the ""tall trees"" you have to get a permit 2 miles south of Orick, which is about 30+ minutes from the tall trees location. We drove to the entrance but it was closed. So we stopped at Lady Bird Grove and it was magnificent! There are plenty of ""tall trees"" to enjoy here and there's no permit needed.

I would recommend this to anyone, as with the easy 0.5 mild walks (Stout Grove Trail), to the more strenuous (Damnation, which was closed!), there is something for everyone. The Hiouchi road was closed and we were told we could not get to the Boy Scout Tree trail but the road opened late morning so we took a chance and it worked out.

Each was alone and they were all separated by about a mile of distance. 3 were definitely young adolescents, and were naively standing in or near the road when we first saw them. The other was much larger and ran fast when it saw our car. The sightings were the highlight of our trip, especially because we were in the safety of our car and away from any adult bears that may have been nearby.Driving back on the highway, we passed a herd of wild elk.

Redwood National Park,"Pictures cannot do justice to this beautiful forest. it requires people and cars in the pictures to realize how majestic these giant trees are. We took the road less traveled into the Jedidiah Smith State park and Redwood National park. The easy way is over a bridge off hwy 160 coming south from Grants Pass. There is a ranger outpost on the north side of the road where you can get directions to Douglas Park Dr and Howland Hill Rd. However, that bridge was under reconstruction and we entered off hwy 101. We visited the visitors center in Crescent City, CA and they directed us down a short distance to the Elk Valley Road that bends into the Howland Hill Rd. Once on this road you will wind your way through these giant redwoods spaced just far enough for a single vehicle to pass through. The road is dirt, dusty, and full of pot holes but that seems to add to the ambiance. After traveling about 5 miles, you enter a parking area with outhouses and trails through the forest as well as down to the Smith river that passes through. You need at least 2 full days to enjoy all that the expanded park has to offer. Unfortunately we only had one which means there is still a lot to see.","June 1, 2016",Humongous Trees,19,"Kingsport, Tennessee, United States",5

For those with young children, I recommend the prairie creek trail that starts at the visitors center and taking it to the big tree. Can take a stroller the whole way. We then we did the cathedral trail and you can't take a stroller on that but we did anyway and had to carry our baby and carry the stroller, as it has inclines and lots of tree roots and then it narrows. My fave was the prairie creek trail. We also went to fern canyon. $8 if you don't have a national parks pass. Worth it. Just go early cuz it was so crowded when we got back to the parking lot! Had our toddler walk that hike/walk. We did the lady bird johnson trail and it was ok. I wouldn't do that one again just cuz it wasn't as spectacular, but you could take a stroller.

Flat trail with lots of rainforest features. Further up Bald Hills Rd, the Redwood Creek Overlook offers an amazing panorama, even in low broken clouds.On up, the narrow paved road turns to a reasonably well maintained dirt road and you find out why it's called Bald Hills. We hiked in to Lyons Ranch, a 100 year sheep operation until about 1960. Again, the only car in the lot. We had a 4 mile round trip down to the old homestead on a jeep track that offered expansive views. Amazingly, there are still old objects in the structures, like a creepy broken tricycle, and remnants of old newspaper used as wallpaper, dating back to 1912.The pavement reappears after the peak, near the turn-off for the fire lookout. You can take Bald Hills all the way to Hwy 96, which then joins 299 at Willow Creek (Bigfoot Central) and you can complete the loop back to McKinleyville.","May 4, 2016",Bald Hills Rd,334,"Houston, Texas",5

Other national parks charge an entrance fee but for $80 you can get an annual pass to The National Parks and Federal Recreational Lands.I'd recommend Late May and Early June for terrific travel without crowds at all the national parks. Each pass covers entrance fees at national parks and national wildlife refuges as well as day use fees at national forests and grasslands, and at lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

There, Rick asked a few simple questions and was able to suggest the best trails, roadside stops and drives for my time and priority. My favorite park for Redwoods was Jedediah Smith, Stout Grove. Then, Prairie Creek for Fern Canyon. Whether you have a week or a few hours, RNPs are worth the stop or the drive through. You can camp, take a serious hike, a short walk, or even a drive to see the majesty of these ancient giants. ","November 2, 2015",A truly magical place,65,,5
Redwood National Park,Really enjoyed all the hikes in this national park. It almost felt like I was in Honey I Shrunk the Kids.

Redwood National Park,"There's something for everyone in the Redwoods if you like nature. Short hikes, long hikes, camping, scenic drives, and more. I stopped by the visitor's center in Crescent City as I entered from the north. Totally worth it. I told the ranger I talked to what kinds of things I was looking for and she helped me out a lot with recommendations, including a great drive through the trees at the north of the park that I would have passed by otherwise.","October 28, 2015",Wonderful trees,9,"Ketchikan, Alaska",5
Redwood National Park,"We entered the park from the north off of Highway 101 onto the Newton B Drury Scenic Parkway. This road took us through the heart of the upper region of the park until we reconnected with highway 101, ie Redwood Highway, over through Orick CA and back along the west coast. Be sure and stop at the ""big tree"" for photo opps and a short easy walking trail. Redwood National Park is free to enter and they give you a map at the entry gate. The park is full of huge redwood trees with a canopy that obliterates the sunlight imparting a silent, eerie response throughout...rather creepy! We were there on a weekday, so not much traffic and signs for headlight use were posted frequently. There are plenty of pull outs for exploring, loads of hiking trails and I believe 3 campgrounds are available in the park. We made a day of it traveling through the Redwood National Park, along Coastal Highway 101 with a stop outside of Eureka CA on the barrier reef at the Somoa Cookhouse (highly recommended...see review) for a late lunch,and then on down to Humboldt Redwoods State Park to camp for the night.

Redwood National Park,"We spent a day hiking in the Prairie Creek area of the park (we really should have planned on 2-3 days). The park staff at the Prairie Creek visitor center were really knowledgeable and friendly: they recommended a great hike that included the James Irvine Trail, the Fern Canyon Trail, a short coastal segment, and the Miners Ridge Trail. In all, this was a 12 mile jaunt, with moderate altitude gains and losses.The entire hike was amazing. Both living and dead trees provided a wonderful variety of things to look at and explore, and they showed how the forest (if given a chance) constantly renews itself.The trails themselves are very well maintained, with opportunities to mix and match trail segments. This allows you to customize your hike easily, both for distance and difficulty.We will have to go back and see some of the other trails in the park. Our visit was a real delight.","October 20, 2015",Beautiful park with great hikes,79,"Whitehorse, Canada",5
Redwood National Park,We visited in August 2015. From the south on the 101 you hit Avenue of the Giants first. All stops on Avenue of the giants are worth it. Then further north is Prarie Creek state park. This park contains fern canyon and some incredible redwood hikes combined with a beach that elk like to graze on. Further up North is Jedidiah Smith state park. This Park contains Stout grove where the Return of the Jedi Endor scenes were filmed. In Jedidiah Smith drive down Howland Hill Road and be sure to hike the Boy scout tree trail for some amazing redwoods. Stout grove is at the end of Howland hill road. There is also a lovely river there. If you're into Gimmicky things the Trees of Mystery Between Prarie Creek and Jedidiah Smith is worth a stop. It has a sky ride and a giant Paul Bunyon Statue out front. All in all the entire Redwood national park is just amazing.,"October 19, 2015",Amazing Bigfoot Country,21,"Los Angeles, California",5

Drove down the hwy to the Prairie Creek State Park drove down to the beach, so neat to look one way to the ocean the other redwoods! and elk on the beach!

I have a friend that assumed he could stop and use the restroom. Echos of his own footsteps in the cavernous entry but no restroom. Lurch appeared as if magically summoned and ran him out though. There are a few visitor centers in the park, just south of Orick at the beach and to the north at Prairie Creek. Check out the Bull Elk embedded in a tree from probably a hundred years ago.

In 1994, the NPS and the State agreed to manage the parks together as the Redwood National and State Parks.Highlights of the National Park portion include the views and redwood groves along Bald Hills Road (trailers and RV’s not recommended), the huge redwoods of Tall Trees Grove (one of the limited, first come-first serve, free permits from the visitor center is required) and the upland Lady Bird Johnson grove where the park was dedicated, all in the vicinity of Orick, CA. Further north, just south of Crescent City, is wonderful Enderts Beach with its sea stacks and excellent tide pooling and definitely worth a visit; after all, it is the almost daily fog rising from the cold water, up the coastal cliffs, that sustain these giants during the dry summer months.The Jedediah Smith SP unit, also near Crescent City, features the Howland Hill Road (narrow and mostly dirt but smooth) which is perhaps the best drive through some of the biggest and oldest coastal redwoods, in an environment that has changed little in millennia. Jedediah Smith also features Stout Grove which features a dense concentration of large old growth redwoods, free of an understory of smaller trees that would obscure the view of the giants, with ferns carpeting the ground and considered by many to be the most picturesque redwood grove as a result.Along the coast between Crescent City and Klamath to the south, with the Redwoods Hwy running through it, is the Del Norte Coast SP unit where the morning sun rising in the east tries to penetrate the fog rolling in from the west through the redwoods creating a primordial scene that is absolutely beautiful, especially in spring and early summer when large numbers of rhododendrons are in bloom; in fact, this area is the primary source of the classic photographs of huge redwoods shrouded in mist, surrounded by pink rhododendrons.Further south, between Klamath and Orick, is the Prairie Creek SP unit which, in our opinion, is the best overall park offering excellent examples of all the features of the other units as well as some unique ones. If you unfortunately have time to visit only one unit, this would be the one. Prairie Creek offers excellent scenic driving through old growth redwoods along the Newton B Drury Parkway; interpretive and hiking trails of varying length through massive lowland redwood groves with some of the best and most accessible radiating from Big Tree Wayside; an example of rugged coastline at Gold Bluffs Beach; a large heard of Roosevelt Elk that frequent the southern end of the park, and Fern Canyon whose shear 50ft (15m) walls are covered in fern and spectacular enough to be used as a location in the filming of Jurassic Park 2: The Lost World.","July 22, 2015",A Wonderful Combination of Federal & State Parks,3757,"Avon, Ohio",5

Redwood National Park,"We enjoyed this short day trip from our rented house in Trinidad. First we hiked Fern Canyon, which is lush and beautiful walk along a gentle gurgling creek. The hike itself is short, but the drive in is long and dusty. Also be aware of the pond-sized puddles on the road in. We then continued North on the 101 just a smidge to view meadows of beautiful grazing elk. Next stop North was a visit to Big Tree at Prairie Creek. Wow, he is large, at a 21 foot diameter.

Redwood National Park,"This park is really a group of 3 California state parks (Jed Smith, Mill Creek and Prarie Creek) the national park is a buffer zone around the three parks. So, you're not really visiting a natiinal park, you're visiting a CA park. Thus no entrance fee only a day use fee. I camped at Mill Creek and then traveled to all of the areas over three days. The parks were somewhat busy (for the area) but not nearly as busy as other National Parks. However all of the campgrounds were full l, other than a few walk in beach sites. The campgrounds I checked out were very nice and well kept. They are overrun with Stellers Jays and they are loud. Really loud. Campsites are $35/night, which seemed high to me .. My favorites:1. Sampson Grove on Walker Road.2. The scenic drive and visit of the beach around the Klammath River slough. 3. The drive down Davison Road all the way to Gold Beach. Be aware wherever you go, it will take you nearly twice as as long to get there as you think. The drive from Eureka was forever .. and the distance isn't that great.

The trail has all these little side-paths you can travel along, too, some of which taking you inside old hollowed-out trees. It's a must-see if you're in the area (and it wasn't even too crowded when we went—on a Sunday, no less).Also important: The gift shop at the visitors' center sells fairly realistic giant banana-slug magnets.

We did Lady Bird Grove (fine..basic, nothing exciting, good for littles and older) Trillium Falls (had water in July!!!) was moderately strenuous, but still fine for the kids. Best hike we've done in ages. Prairie CreekTrail was also done...excellent, but again, safe. Try some of the off the beaten bath trails for total peace and quiet. Elk Meadow to view the elk was fantastic. Davidson Road to the GoldBluff Beach was a perfect lunch/play break. Follow the gravel road to Fern Canyon...was amazing.

I'm not sure if all of Eureka, CA. is as rundown as we saw but it was enough to make us cancel our hotel reservations and drive about 20 minutes north. Park rangers were friendly at the welcome center, you should stop there at least for the basics. We had a small dog and found out that there were some trails that pets were not allowed on. CHP will pull you over for speeding. I was pulled over fo doing 80 in a 60 and the officer seemed over friendly and asked me to slow down.....seemed as though he was too nice, if that's possible, but no complaints here! Pet friendly hotels within 30-45 minutes drive. Take jackets and hiking boots or tennis shoes. Check your brakes and tire conditions before departing; many steep/sharp curves in the park as well as while driving to the park, especially if coming from the east. Pack pack recommended. Cell phone service in the actual peak was non-existent for us. Take snacks for small children.

Redwood National Park,"Redwood National Park is a big place. This comment is about the new trail called Berry Glen Trail that leads uphill from Elk Meadow. That is a rest stop north of Orik, just before Prairie Creek State Park, maybe 3 miles, and on the turn off for the beach. The meadow is a nice picnic place. No staff, bathrooms, and a good place to park, turn around an RV or truck. It also has great Elk viewing most of the time. This time there are no Elk, but usually there are. Berry Glen Trail is reached by following the trail at the south end of the meadow, it will level cross rt 101 after a foot bridge over the water. Berry Glen Trail cuts to the right down an old lumber road and then cuts uphill. After about 20 mins along the trail going up about 300 feet, one walks into old growth redwoods. It continues to be wonderful views of old growth forest all the way up to Lady Bird Johnson grove. That grove is more of the same thing with more vistors arriving from the road above. Budget four hours to go from bottom to top and go around the Lady Bird Johnson grove too. I chose to time myself this time and only go up for about an hour and a half and then turn around. The whole walk is worth it and all of it is stunningly beautiful. There were few mosquitos, if any, up the hill and I did not see another person during the three hours I was hiking. The meadow below has many good spots to have lunch and many nice, shorter, trails to other woods and water nearby. I am posting a rare photo here. Rare because there are no elk. Many thanks to the rangers at the visitor center, just south of Orik, who told me about this hike.

We only had the better part of a day to see it and we spent the most time in the lady Bird Johnson grove area. We attempted to see the fern canyon area but after driving for 12 miles on the worst dirt road you've ever seen we had to turn back due to a small creek crossing the road. I could not chance it with a compact rental car and there was no signs indicating this would be a potential hurdle before you get going down the road. The trees are beautiful but to me they look mostly the same unlike the Sequoia's which seem to have distinct characteristics that set them apart from one another. If I was in the area again I would give a different part of the park a shot to see more. A word of caution, the roads that go to and from the Coast are packed with what seems like endless 10mph hairpin curves. It was draining to drive for 30+ miles on a road so curvy.

You see these giant trees and it is intimidating. It's like nature saying to you, ""yeah, we control stuff around here..."", brilliant. However, I would have liked to stop and take more of it in but I couldn't. See, the car rental company, Alamo, wouldn't come to my motel to swap my non air conditioned with something that worked. They were going to charge me to do that, for a problem that was theirs. So I find myself waiting for the car to be fixed and waiting for a phone call which means I have to travel the hundred miles to Oregon and back. Nice.

Redwood National Park,"This is a tricky one. I went into the Redwood National Park and was disappointed. The trees were pretty enough and there were some nice viewpoints, but I was mostly disappointed. However, the next stop I made was in the Prairie Creek Redwood state park and it was 100 percent amazing. The trees are so tall and the forest is dense and so green. It was as if I was stepping back into the age of the dinosaurs. The trails were gorgeous and you could see the fog rolling into the forest from the ocean. It was exactly what I expected from the Redwoods. One thing I would recommend is Fern Canyon. The drive through the forest to get to the canyon is beautiful by itself, but the canyon is incredible. Once I started walking on the trail, there was a herd of elk maybe 20 yards away. The trail has lots of water running through it, so be prepared to jump across creeks and wear waterproof shoes! Once you get into the canyon, it is incredible. The ferns are everywhere you look and it has an eerie feeling to it. Another fun fact is jurassic park 2 was filmed here! Overall, I would absolutely go see Prairie Creek again, but I would skip the national park.","May 17, 2015",Redwood National Park,29,michigan,5

Redwood National Park,The helpful staff at the visitor center in Crescent City told us to take the Howland Hill road through the forest. We were pressed for time and had to be back in Medford Oregon at a certain time. The road is an old carriage trail that is now a fairly rough gravel road. An adventurous motorcyclist could manage but would need to be very alert. The trees of course are really indescribable. We took a ton of pictures but even after being there the pictures still don't convey the enormity of the trees! Just an amazing trip - highly recommended.

When you turn onto the small two lane highway to drive through the forest, the car immediately goes silent. You immediately realize that your among ancient organisms, thousands of years old. You don't have to be a tree hugger, an environmentalist, or a mystic to be completely and utterly absorbed by the greatness of the redwoods.

They limit how many people go each day and you have to get a permit from the ranger and he tried to convince us not to do it because it is a strenuous hike but we went anyways. Yes, it is a bumpy ride to get there. Yes it is a 800ft descent (and then you have to hike back), yes, I have knee problems, but I did it!!

Redwood National Park,While traveling across country my husband and I stopped at Redwood National Park. We first stopped at the parks information center in Crescent City and got a map and directions. This is recommended as the trees are not in one location and there is another park next to this park. We were expecting the park to have a special route for just the park but the road through the park is a regular country route. The trees are along the coast and inland and some go past small towns and homes. Now the trees are huge both around and tall and are breathtaking! We stopped at the Lady Byrd Johnson grove of old Redwoods and walked the path. A walking bridge goes across the road and continues through the woods. Not only are the trees beautiful but the silence was a real experience. Here they have a pamphlet you can pick up on the trail that tells abut the different trees along the trail. There are signs along the way on the road and trails and lots of places to take pictures. At one point there is a tree on it's side where you can take pictures. We also stopped in a picnic area that had a great tree on it's side for shots also. The history of the trees and the lumbering industry that almost cleared out the old groves and the protecting of the trees now is very interesting. We really enjoyed standing between two large trees and showing how small you feel next to them. We did not go to the area where you drive through the tree but took another route through another part of the park. We would recommend taking pictures with people or other objects to show the scale of these beautiful trees. Worth the trip!,"December 15, 2014",...and they are BIG,324,"Smithfield, Virginia",5

There are many other trails or you can drive the 10 mile stretch and rejoin the 101. Continuing north, there is a turn off for the Klamath Overlook, but only do this if the weather is clear, if it is foggy you will not see anything! Near Klamath, you can also drive through a redwood tree I your car for a nominal charge which was fun.

Take a look, visuals are amazing:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPRz0USZRCMTo sum up what we did, we camped in Prairie Creek and did the hikes around the area. Fern Canyon is a MUST SEE. You CANNOT miss Fern Canyon. Just watch the video to see why. Words don't do it justice. It can get crowded, so be prepared to battle some families and other tourists in the canyon, but it's soooo worth it. Also, do the hikes at Jedidiah Smith, Avenue of the Giants, and Boy Scout Tree. Yes, the trees are enormous and definitely a sight to see. You won't believe the size of some of them. But beyond that, the nature in general is just breathtaking. It's very green, the air is clean and crisp, and there's lots of wildlife to view. We saw two male elk on an empty beach!!! Such an amazing sight - also covered in my video. Lots of banana slugs, tons of reptiles. Keep in mind, this is Northern California....it stays on the cooler side here. Even though we went in August, when most of the country is sweltering, we were bundled up in sweaters during the day (60 degrees) and thermals at night (around 40 degrees). After four days, we could have stayed longer. While we saw a lot in that time, we felt like there was a lot more to see!

Redwood National Park,"Upon reaching Redwood National and State Parks, my first order of business was to stop by the visitors center at its entrance. (I also had to do a quick clothes change–anything that can spill on white will spill on white.) The rangers there gave me a map of the park and a couple of suggestions on routes based on the amount of time I had available to visit. I was surprised there was no admission charge into the park (nor did they ask for my national park pass). I found out why.US-101, which takes you through the parks, is a functioning, normal highway, so it is used by both park tourists and everyone else. There are towns with businesses and residences, too. (And things are *really* expensive there.) This meant I had to pull over a lot to let others pass, but fortunately, there were numerous pullouts so I could take my time and enjoy the sights but stay out of the way of other folks who had regular, Monday things to do.The portions of the park by the Pacific Ocean were very foggy, but inland was clear and extraordinarily beautiful. I visited in early June, so there were many moments where I had the road to myself and really take my time communing with the majestic scenery.

A slight elevation change at the beginning but easy thereafter. Kids will love taking the river trail branch down to the Smith River across a small bridge over and side creek ( see pic)and than over the rustic foot bridge over the river.The Howland Hill road is an experience. The kids will love creeping the car around the huge Redwoods. the driver not so much. Very narrow and requires going slow and having faith that people coming the other way are doing the same. The Park sign stating ""not advised"" for trailers and RV's"" shows that the Park people do have a sense of humor But the tress are massive and worth it.Lost Man Creek south of Elk Prairie. Drive the short distance though the spooky forest to the trail head, park and walk the very good and level pathway through the quiet forest. Good picnic spot. Lost Man creek with its pools and ledges is arguably the prettiest in the Parks. It is only 1/3 mile to the first creek bridge.

Redwood National Park,"Not my favorite National Park, and personally I liked the presentation at Muir Woods better. All things considered, this collection of the national park and the California state parks preserve the largest remaining tracts of redwood trees in the world.My impression of the whole place is that this park was assembled Frankenstein like from bits and pieces. And it was. As national parks go, this one is recent, established in 1968, and only after timber companies had cut many of the areas. The park is not continuous but was probably the best that could be done. As a result, there are a few scenic drives that preserve the forest primeval such as my personal favorite ""Avenue of the Giants"" which isn't actually in the national park at all, but to the south in Humboldt Redwoods State Park.We enjoyed Fern Canyon (again not in Redwood National Park but in Prairie Redwoods State Park), and Big Tree wayside along the Newton B Drury Parkway.Ultimately though, and I'm sure you've heard it before, to really enjoy the park you must park your car and walk in the forest. The park is large enough that even in the height of tourist season you aren't likely to have to wait to park, and you can enjoy the peace and solitude of the forest to yourself. You won't have that experience from your car.There are several visitor centers and they do a pretty good job overall of directing you to the sights. They are also a model of cooperation between national and state parks. Further, if you have a National Parks recreation pass, it's accepted at the state parks too.They also offer a pretty good junior ranger program. Not the best, but interesting enough, and you can pick it up at one visitor center, work on it all day and then have it checked at a different visitor center.","September 12, 2014",Great place to see the tallest trees in the world.,575,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",4

Redwood National Park,"If you are looking for superlative redwoods I would go elsewhere. Prairie Creek and Jedediah and even Del Note Coast all have more impressive and more easily accessible redwoods. Lady Bird Johnson Grove is alright. But the parking lot is small and often full in the summer. Redwood groves on ridges, like Lady Bird, tend to be smaller than those in valleys, like Prairie or Mill Creeks. If you want big trees go elsewhere.Tall Trees Grove is impressive. But access requires driving over an hour and a half round trip through logged over and dusty roads. Then it is over a mile hike down 700 feet to the grove. The ""Tall Tree isn't, and probably was never, the world's tallest tree. The taller ones just hadn't been found and measured yet.

Redwood National Park,"We spent two full days in the park. And we walked about 15 miles total in 5 trails. Best trail in the park was ""Tall Tree"" trail, which was a permit only trail. You first need to visit visitor center to get a permit. Then, a ranger will give you a map and 4 digit code for the pad lock at gated entrance. We were told that the hole trip from visitor center till the end of hike would take about 4 hours. We took 4.5 hours. Once you enter the gate, there is 6+ miles of unpaved road. At the trail head, there are two parking spots. Hiking guide indicated 800ft elevation gain and a bit over 3.5 miles hike was strenuous. It's easy on the way down. All down hill for 30 minutes. Then you'll find one mile loop in Tall Tree Grove area. It's a beautiful area. The best part is it's not crowded at all since it's permit only area. Then, on the way back to trail head was very hilly. We took a couple of breaks, and come back safely. It was a good work out.","September 5, 2014",beautiful primeval forest,19,San Francisco,5
Redwood National Park,"Redwoods are just tall trees until you stand before one. Then you realize that it is a special experience to be able to visit and see trees that are over 1,500 years old. Still standing and still alive after everything our Earth has undergone. The sheer size and majesty can not be portrayed in mere words. You must experience this natural phenomenon for yourself. The hike to the Tall Trees Grove is difficult because it's a straight downhill hike for 1.5 miles before reaching the Tall Trees Grove. Then it's another mile loop around the Grove, which is an experience one will not forget. It's a magical place that takes some work to reach, but it is certainly worth it. Then finally, it's a 1.5 mile hike straight up to the original point. And that's not calculating the hour it takes to get to the trailhead--over rough roads.

We were able to get out and take pictures just to show to others. Once we finally got to the drive through tree, it was closed and dark.

You are surrounded by trees reaching hundreds of feet into the sky and so wide that 4 of us, arms stretched could not reach around the bases. There are many, many attractions there including a cable car ride that takes you up and over the tree tops, a tree you can drive through (if you have a small car). We strolled through the trees to reach the Ladybird Johnson area - about a 2 mile walk, breathtaking and so quiet. Information is spaced along the trail telling the history of the growth, fascinating. You do need time to really take in all that there is to offer. A drive through the Avenue of the Giants is awesome, you need to stop off at the various parking points and walk the trails - most are short - to experience the magnitude of what you are seeing.","August 29, 2014",Awe inspiring,23,"Silverton, Oregon",5

Read on and you will know what I mean- The Park Service was very worried about car break-ins at the parking lot and warned us about it repeatedly- There are 5 sites; three has its own space and privacy but two are right next to each other in an open area- Camping permit is free and the registrant can stay a maximum of 5 nights. 3-4 people means two to three weeks of free camping- Since the site is only a 10 min walk from the parking lot and staying there is free you may not get your genuine backpacker\backcountry campers. While we were there, some people would just jump into their car and drive 5 mins into Crescent City for food- There is cellphone coverage at the site. Whether that’s good or bad is up to you to decide- The beach is only a 2 minutes’ walk from the camp and it was beautiful and mostly deserted while we were there- The toilet is smellyOverall we would not call this camp site a ‘backcountry’ experience.

The trees were by far bigger than any I had ever expected or even dreamed of. Besides large trees, there were many with various types of ""character"". The twisted, thick, ""braided"" trees were like something from a fantasy. Be prepared to search for parking at the most popular trails. Also, though you can see a lot of beauty from the car, the jewels can only be found by hiking the trails. Everyone should see this natural wonder at least once. Only warning- roads are often twisted and steep, make sure that you have a vehicle that is up to the tight turns and steep hills. My full size pickup required me to slow way down to make the turns.

We visited Prairie Creek Visitor Center and did a 5.6 mile portion of the main and Westridge trails. The next day we did the short 1.4 mile loop in the Lady Bird Johnson Grove, which was really beautiful. In the Park, one can't help but experience a feeling of reverence for Mother Nature's beauty. Anyone will enjoy a visit there.On the drive out of Lady Bird Johnson grove, a baby black bear was foraging along the side of the road.

The drive is chock full of beautiful giants and plenty of turnoffs to check them out. Included is a number of overlooks out toward the end that provide an excellent view of the surrounding valleys.

We picked a ""easy"" trail and happened to be the only ones on it that particular day. The forest has a magical quality about it. It was warm, quiet with a slight breeze and all you could hear was the babbling stream, our footsteps and crackling twigs underfoot.

It is certainly a place where you can reflect on just how insignificant we are compared to the forces of nature. The fact that those trees can survive thousands of years through drought, fire, etc. is amazing. We were a little disappointed in the job the park service does with information services in the park. Perhaps it is because we live outside Yellowstone that we are spoiled, but we were never really able to find a map that would show us the exact path of a specific trail, or the distance between points. When the trail would fork, there were no signs telling you what was ahead in either direction or how far anything was. We spent a lot of time backtracking, or hiking back to the car up a road from a trail that the sign had called a ""loop"" which clearly wasn't a ""loop"". Overall, we loved it and can't wait to go again and explore the parts we missed.","June 30, 2014",Mother Nature Did Her Part,24,"Rexburg, Idaho",4

Redwood National Park,"The Redwood National and State Parks (as they are known) can be confusing because the sights you might want to see are spread out and in different parks. A visit to one of the visitor centers will relieve any confusion.We visited both the Crescent City and the Kuchel centers. We were staying near Crescent City and went there first. We were so glad we did. We told the ranger how much time we had, what kind of things we like to do (walks but no big hikes) and we went from there. She gave us great advice, all of which we followed and we were glad we did.On our way south we stopped at the Kuchel center which is north of Eureka, near Orick. In addition to giving us a lot of information on the geography of the area (an interest of my husband) the ranger also suggested we visit the small town of Trinidad if we wanted some lunch and to visit a great beach area. He was so right.Originally I thought I wanted to see the famous 'avenue of the giants' but after being in the area for awhile and seeing what the national and state parks offered it didn't seem worth the trouble to drive down there. It is a very commercial stretch of road and the Redwoods there are no better (some say not as nice) as the ones in the Parks. Of course if you are determined to drive through a tree...you have to go there. It gets a lot of press because it's closer to San Francisco.While at the parks we saw the Lady Bird Johnson Grove. Great drive up and lovely walk, so quiet. We were there on a foggy morning it was wonderful.We drove the Newton Drury Scenic drive in Prairie Creek State Park and walked the Ah-Pah trail among others. The Ah-Pah is fascinating, the trail was a full blown road not that many years ago and along the trail they describe how they brought it back to nature.We saw the SImpson-Reed grove in the Jedediah Smith Park and that was great too.

It parallels 101 for about ten miles. You can enter the scenic byway from the north or south. The scenic byway gives you the easiest access to big beautiful trees.Take a short or long walk through the trees on one of the many trails.We walked the Lady Bird Johnson trail. It was spectacular. A short nearly level walk through the redwoods. I think it was about a mile. Not really a hide more of a tour because we stopped and read information every hundred yards or so.

This is also the nicest restroom at the park so take advantage of it.Our favorite area is Cal Barrel trail - really feels like Jurassic Park meets Empire Strikes Back:) Get there earlier in the day so that you can see elk along the way and mist settles in the forrest and the canopies. The easy trail is the Roosevelt (Lady Bird) one and there are so many 'picture' moments.

Between the giant trees in massive forests, the miles of coastline, or the banana slugs among the ferns this place is a must see for all humans. We started at the visitor center in Crescent City, where the rangers were helpful and where I learned that this park is unique as it is both a State and National Park, (mutally funded), all in one. I asked for their newly published map at the visitors center, which was good, because this park spans 40 miles of rugged coastline among the redwood forest and there are no cell signals to speak of for navigation software to work. There are many places to visit so select four or five points of interest on the map such as Crescent Beach Overlook, High Bluff Overlook, Nickel Creek, Lady Bird Johnson Grove and Tall Trees Grove. Majestic Redwoods with fields of shamrocks were picture perfect, although, it it hard to photograph an entire redwood tree.

The following are just some random ideas and thoughts.Here is a link to the trails in most of the major Coastal Northern Redwood Parks complete with distance, elevation gains, and scenic ratings: http://www.redwoodhikes.comFrom my limited experience, the ratings are correct. One park is not better than the others. They all have great stuff, just pick several trails and go for it.Here is a link specific for Humboldt Hiking (trail head, etc.) - http://humboldtredwoods.org/hiking Below are just some random personal impressions of the entire Northern section - Crescent City to below Humboldt:Stout Grove - great, and an easy walk - access off Howland Hill RoadHowland Hill Road - fabulous 10/10 scenic easy dirt road - highly recommend it - 1/10 difficultyThe Coastal off road drive at Klamath does not connect to Newton B Drury Scenic ParkwayThe Klamath overlook off Requa was not an impressive view pointEnderts Beach - from the top parking area, it didn't draw me in (i.e., didn't do it)Newton B Drury Scenic Parkway - This is essentially Prairie Creek Redwood Park - Take it!Fern Canyon - totally enjoyed the dirt road going out there - at most it's 2/10 difficulty, i.e. pretty easy - Fern Canyon itself - really didn't get why it's that fabulous - bring water shoesThe James Irvine/Miners trail to Fern canyon is reported to be 5 stars out of 5.Lady Bird Johnson Grove - great and easyTrillium Falls was goodPatrick's Point - Just hit the biggest attractions, then move onTrinidad Head Loop - there are a lot of better hikesArcata City (above Eureka) - randomly just dropped by - wow, what fun it was on a Sunday afternoon (any central market, fair, show would work). It's wonderfully ""Kookie"" and what a great place to go to college (Humboldt State)Eureka - sorry, I don't get it. They are trying to attract tourists. It doesn't ""do it"" for me.

Rockefeller is 1.2 miles west on Manttole Road on your left (not well marked). Picking a longer trail, and missing these Groves also seems like a good plan.

I would say that if you have not been to the region before, make sure that you take a few minutes to look at a map before you start out. It's a little confusing because there is a National Park (but no fee) as well as State Parks and Beach areas that are all part of the same area. Once you have a plan, head on out...there are so many sights to see that you just can't go wrong. The groves of trees are just amazing and breathtaking. Even if you don't plan to spend days in the park, make sure that you take a walk around the Ladybird Johnson Grove. It's an easy walk and you get to see a great sample of the Redwoods. We hit this area early in the morning and it was so quiet and peaceful. Just us and the trees. It was a great time for some introspection. You definitely feel small! Make sure you take time to drive around all the areas. There are areas where you can see the elk from your vehicle just standing by the road. There are breathtaking views of the ocean from atop cliffs. There are roadways where you can take a white-knuckle drive through the trees.

The ranger provided us with maps and recommendations for beach and redwood hiking. Right in back of the visitor center is a great access to the beach and ocean, and we took about a 1/2 mile hike (each way) along the ocean to the Redwood River outlet. This is very beautiful, with lots of driftwood and birds. Then we drove North to Bald Hills Road, and drove about 2 miles up this road to Lady Bird Johnson Grove. Here there is an about 1.3 mile loop interpretive trail that travels on a well kept path through towering Redwoods. We then proceeded up Bald Hills Road another 2 miles to Redwood Creek Overlook. Although there are great views from this 2100 ft overlook, we could have skipped the extra drive in favor of hiking through the big redwoods. Next we proceeded back down Bald Hills Road to Hwy 101, and then North to the Drury Scenic Parkway at exit 753. Here we stopped at Big Tree Trail head, and took the Big Tree / Cathedral Trees / Prairie Creek loop trail. These trails took us about 2.7 miles through tall beautiful redwood trees on well maintained trails. The Prairie Creek trail is especially beautiful with some nice bridges and cuts through large redwood trees.

Redwood National Park,"This is a gem of Northern California scenic places to visit. It was a labor day weekend, we 3 families stayed in one of Trinidad's vacation rental (Retro Retreat $900) for 3 nights, we planned for 2 but the minimum was 3, in fact it turned out to be good other wise it would have been a exhaustive trip. On Day one we just roam around Trinidad, beaches, light house, Paticks Point, once passing Patricks point there is an RV park and old school museum where they do have a community music band and free food (you can donate $$ for the food) on weekends, we had great burgers and coffee, then proceed to Gold Bluff's Beach. It's a 20-30 minutes drive through the woods, slight rough roads and small creeks you can drive through. You need to walk down to see the fern canyon and water falls which is a mind refreshing experience, I would suggest plan for an afternoon at this place. We didn't that much time so we spent some time at fern canyon and didn't reach to falls as it was farther and park hours are about to close for the day. We had a close encounter with Elks at this place. Day two we took south to visit shrine drive through tree as we didn't know there was another one in Klamath, so that we could visit drive through tree and trees of mystery in one trip.It turned out to be good as this place has few parking spots inside the park. Even though the tree is supported by the cables and it's leaned to one side. It's not a tall tree, it's a hollow tree vertically (been cut off) and horizontally where you drive through.They are saying that the trunk of the tree has been burned off and fall down ~100 ft from the level. Tree is still alive and it has leaves and branches as well. I visited the leget drive through tree as well, more or less you 'll get the same feeling as you drive through the tree, if you expecting for a fully sized tree from top to bottom, it's not what it is. We still had time to spent but not enough to reach Klamath for visiting trees of mystery. So we took a tour through avenue of gaints and swim at one of the river passing near by. You can drive in to river and park next to the water. The water was not that cold too. We spent some time playing with water, and refreshing swim. Then we visited the one of the beaches at Crescent, it was early evening and a bit cold but kids enjoyed it's fullest as the beach is more of sandy than muddy. On day 3 we went to visit trees of mystery at Klamath, we could have do both day 2 and 3 in one day if we went to Klamath on day 2. On our way back we took a stop at Carson Mansion which is a really great place to visit.","September 7, 2013",Red wood National Park,8,"Roseville, California",5

The campsites were very quiet, nice showers and bathrooms, and several elk really did hang out in the prairie by the campground all day. In addition, there are a number of intersecting trails in this park that take you through amazing, beautiful and huge redwood trees.

I thought there would be clear boundaries to the park maybe one main entrance but I never found anything like that. I think there just aren't clear boundaries around the park since it's free.

Redwood National Park,"When we first entered areas where the redwood trees started appearing along both sides of the highway, we felt like we were in a different world. After spending a night in Fortuna we drove to the Avenue of the Giants in Humboldt Redwoods State Park (part of the Redwood National Park) and made several stops along the way. If you are short on time, the Founder's Grove trail is an easy, level walk through the trees. Walking among the trees takes your breath away! The trees are so tall that the sunlight is very filtered along the trails, allowing other plants to grow in the shade. Take time to read the informative plaques on the trail. The night before we visited the Avenue of the Giants we had hoped to walk on the recommended Lady Bird Johnson trail (which is further north) but discovered when we arrived there that RVs are not permitted on the road that leads to the trail so we had to turn around in the designated turn-around area. North of Fortuna, California on 101 there are also opportunities to view elk safely. We listened to the radio broadcast on the station that was posted on the roadsign which gave us directions to Davison Road, an excellent location to view these magnificent animals walking right across the road in front of us. Park brochures indicate other areas to view them also.You could easily spend several days enjoying these trees and the other plants, wildlife and scenic areas.

Redwood National Park,"I've been visiting Redwood National Park since the very early 1970's. To sum it up, the trees and scenery never fail to impress!A couple of the previous reviews suggest that potential visitors do some research ahead of time before they visit and that is an *excellent* idea. Redwood NP is not a compact, ""enter at the main gate"" park as are many National Parks.Rather, it's a sprawling park that covers about 40-50 miles in a long narrow band. Highway 101 goes right through it, with cars, RVs and trucks. But don't despair as there are thousands of acres of beautiful quiet scenery that is far from the highway. And you don't have to be an ultra-fit hiker to reach these areas, either! Use the search box at the top right of any page here on TripAdvisor for information and reviews about the California Coastal Trail, as well as for natural attractions listed in the towns of Crescent City, Klamath, Orick, Trinidad and Eureka.Within the NP are several State Parks but don't let the boundaries confuse you. Don't worry about which are ""National"" and which are ""State"" areas. They all sort of blend together. I'd suggest looking at the map of Redwood NP before you visit to get an idea of how the parks intertwine with each other.Also, keep in mind that this park contains not only the magnificent trees, but also gorgeous sweeping ocean vistas, many creeks, huge saltwater lagoons, a seemingly endless variety of flora and of course, the famous *elk*.There is something for everyone here, and Redwood National Park should be on everyone's ""must see"" list!","July 2, 2013",Planning before you go will enhance your visit,2876,Oregon Coast,5
Redwood National Park,"Great family experience!!! We visited The Redwoods in late June and had a terrific time learning about these magnificent trees. Our first stop was the Jedidiah Smith Information Center located at US Highway 101 at Hiouchi, Calif. Here we picked up an information packet and directions to the Stout Grove. The ranger service offers guided tours daily. The Stout Grove tour started at 2 pm. The directions led me in the right direction but the turn to the stout grove was a little hard to find because the sign was opposite of the direction of travel. Once I realized I went to far, I turned around and saw the sign leading to the Grove. The Ranger for the tour was very knowledgeable. We hiked on the trail for about 45 minutes and learned about the Park and the trees. I was completely awe struck by the serenity that filled my soul while in the presence of the Redwoods here. For lack of words ,Zen,is the closest thing that I could say about the Redwoods.Bring Mosquito repellant. The trail lies close to the Rogue River and you will be eaten alive without it. Expect to be amazed!!!","July 2, 2013",Zen,8,pocatello,5
Redwood National Park,"This was my second visit to the Redwoods. I didn't think it was possible to top my first visit, but I was wrong. As a tall person, I felt very small. My wife aptly says that the Redwoods ""command silence."" Unconsciously, I found myself tiptoeing in reverence and at times crying. One of the trees was over 1,500 years old. How I wish they could talk! My only regret was the lack of time. It caused me to stop and contemplate in respectful silence.

Redwood National Park,"Redwood National Park is a huge park that requires a little planning to get the most out of the experience. I would give Humboldt Redwoods SP a slight edge over Redwood NP but it's an apples/oranges debate. Driving through Redwood National Park is easy and there are many, clearly marked signs for area attractions. We were going north on the 101 so I'm going to list the details from south to north 101. I would first stop at the Thomas H Kuchel Visitor Center, which is just before the town of Orick (one of the only places around to get decent food) and get some info about the many different things to do in the park. If you would like to go on some great hikes the Park Rangers can provide some clarity on the hundreds of trails available. A must-do stop is the Lady Bird Johnson grove which is just past the town of Orick on the right hand side of the road. There are a few different hikes but the primary one is about a mile long. It is a very easy hike and took us about 45 minutes. This hike presents the Redwoods in many different states and I'll list a few: fire damage, fallen trees, hollowed-out trees, and many various shapes and sizes. Our next stop after the LBJ Grove was the Elk Meadow. This is a pretty quick turn-off. There are dozens of Elk grazing in a meadow just off the 101. It was very cool to get an up-close look at these huge deer. We were fortunate to get an even closer look at Elk as we took the Newton B Drury Scenic Pkwy. This is the closest drive equitable to the Avenue of the Giants at Humboldt SP. As soon as we turned onto the Pkwy we noticed dozens of Elk just off the side of the road. We were able to get much closer pics of the Elks at this spot compared to the Elk Meadow. The Pkwy goes on for about 15 miles and it takes you on a windy road directly through the Redwood forest. It is a stunningly beautiful drive. Also, a majority of the great hiking trails were along this road and very accessible. We were hoping to see some whales so we stopped lastly at the Klamath River Overlook. The overlook features a beautiful view of the Pacific but we were there on a rainy day and were unsuccessful in our attempts to spot some whales. The Rangers at the visitor center told us that March thru early May you can see whales with regularity but timing is everything. I would suggest staying somewhere locally for a night or two to get the most out of the Redwood NP. Trinidad is a quaint little town which overlooks a beautiful bay and is just 15 minutes south of the park. We would highly recommend this town as a stopping point. The Redwoods rank as one of the coolest sights I've ever seen and I can't wait to take my kids there someday.","June 5, 2013",Spend a day or two,91,"Orlando, Florida",5

So many gorgeous campgrounds; so many gorgeous trails to explore. Stayed at the Elk Prairie campground - beautiful and serene with a mellow creek running through it. Bathroom facilities were topnotch: showers were extremely clean and water hot - there is a fee for the showers (25 cents per 2.5min). Also stayed at Mill Creek campground: further north with secluded campsites. Bathroom facilities older, showers not as clean, and varying prices for the showers. Viewed the Jedediah campground even further north - close to Stout grove, but no more special than the other two. Tons of hiking nearby; ocean always within 20m drive.

We were also lucky enough to see grey whales at the coastal overlook on Requa Road which is where the Klamath River flows into the Pacific. This is a gorgeous vista. There are lots of places to get out and hike, but be sure to stop and see the Big/Giant tree that has over a 20 foot diameter. It is only a 5 minute walk from the main road on a good trail.

There are very few places left in our country where nature can be appreciated at its finest, but these redwoods are a reminder of the beauty nature holds. The trees are huge and if only they could talk, what a story they could tell of their 1500 years. No matter what the weather or time of year this park is not to be missed.

Redwood National Park,"We didn't have a lot of time to spend in the park, but we did hike a bit and had one of the highlights of our trip at the Klamath River Overlook.We hiked around Lady Bird Johnson Grove and were amazed at the beauty and size of these trees. Truly another world. We also stopped by Elk Meadow and saw approximately 25 elk grazing - again, amazing!However, the highlight was a stop at the Klamath River Overlook, upon advice from the park ranger at the visitor center. Within 5 minutes of getting out of our car at the parking lot up top, we spotted two whales spouting and breaching. We then hiked down to the platforms that get you closer to the ocean. We sat there for over 2 hours watching about 5 whales swim, spout, jump and play. It was absolutely worth the visit and I would highly recommend this stopping point for anyone in the area. Warning, you may end up spending most of your day just enjoying the beauty of this spot and watching the whales.I can't wait to go back and explore more of the park!","March 21, 2013",Stunning!

Redwood National Park,"My friend from France and I drove through the 31 Miles and it was good but not great on our way north to the Oregon Dunes. Then we doubled back south from Oregon to see a different group of trees, and we were well rewarded. Ask locals for the turnoff to ""Big Tree"". Then farther north on the 101 Highway before you get to the bridge crossing the Klamath River (it has golden bears on each side but you are a few miles south of the Oregon border) you want to head west on the Newton B Drury Scenic Parkway. There are a lot of little trails heading west and we went through one that took trucks all the way to a river - but we had parked near the Drury Parkway and walked back about a mile. It was spectacular. When you leave there, whatever you do, do not stop at the Legend of Bigfoot giftstore. The portatoilets there were as filthy as I've seen anywhere in traveling to 38 countries. Stop anywhere but there.","March 19, 2013",Here is the best place to view them,64,silicon valley ca,5

I get to come here about one every five to ten years and wish it were sooner everytime. The smells of the forest are incredible and you can start to smell them as you enter each individual park along the coastal route from Oregon a little over the border at Crescent City - Jedidiah State Park down to Muir Woods north of San Fransicisco. The Avenue of the Giants is something to behold and for those who think they have seen the big woods, have not seen anything until the see the might Redwoods and Sequoias of the Pacific NW!","March 19, 2013",One of God's most beautiful places on earth!,22,"Bend, Oregon",5

Redwood National Park,"If you like nature excursions, you must see the redwoods in N. California. Redwoods National Park is really several different parks and is linked with the California State Redwoods Parks. Together, they have plenty to offer. You can hike at any level, from a stroll around a short level path to see a grove of ""cathedral trees"" (very impressive) to multi-day hikes including both forest and seacoast. We were lucky, and caught a week of sunny weather in February, but were told that it is not all that unusual to have good weather then. There is lots of wildlife (be careful driving along Hwy 101 or you may have a little too close an encounter with a deer or elk), but of course the big attraction is the enormous trees, which can be over 300 ft tall and as much as 25 feet (yes, feet) in diameter at the base. We didn't do any of the ""drive through"" trees, as it seemed a little tacky to us, but we saw plenty of big ones. My only regret was that we were too early to see the wildflowers and rhododendrons blooming.All in all, a memorable trip for anyone with an appreciation of nature.","February 25, 2013","Spectacular for ""tree huggers""",97,"Ferndale, Washington",5
Redwood National Park,"Our 3rd stop on our road trip took my son (14) and I to Redwood National and Prairie Creek State Parks. Our first loop was down the Emerald Ridge trail, along Redwood Creek where we spent the night and then up the Tall Trees Trail for an easy 5.5 mile loop. You could choose to dayhike it as well. There isn't anything spectacular about the ER trail or the climb back up the TT trail as they are a means to reach the creek (great for kids) and TT grove, which holds what once were the largest known redwoods until other were later found. Not recommended in spring because the water flow is too fast.The second loop was along the Miner's Ridge trail to Gold Bluffs Beach and then back along the James Irvine trail (passing through Fern Canyon). At about 12 miles this may be a bit much for a dayhike for some people, but it's arguably the best single loop you can do if you want to see everything the area has to offer. Highly recommend staying at Gold Bluffs Beach (they had closed Miner's Ridge backcountry site in 2012) and had made site #25 at GBB a hike/bike only (with cheaper fees) the DAY we got there. I see now that only 8 people are allowed at that site and it's not clear whether you can reserve a spot. Elk were grazing through the campground as we hiked in. It will be windy on the beach though site 25 is protected fairly well. We shared it with 2 other users. Fern Canyon was wonderful, too, and we had it all to ourselves since we got an early start (not a single car in the day use lot!).","February 17, 2013",2 classic dayhike/backpack loops,85,Terre Haute,5

We asked one of the Rangers for his advice on how to spend our day. He started describing a few sites and hikes in the south area of the park. We then asked if there was anything we should see up north in the Crescent City area. His eyes lit up and said that was his favorite area. With that endorsement, we knew we were heading north first. He suggested a few sites and we were off.We drove the Newton B Drury Scenic Parkway and it was stunning. It was foggy and the Redwoods looked majestic. We came away thinking the Redwoods look even better in the fog than they do in the full sun. Our first stop was Park Headquarters in Crescent City. Driving north its on the right side. Yes, they have passport stamps.Our next stop was Stout Grove. (Technically this is in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park) You get here by driving Howland Hill Rd. It's a flat but unpaved road that winds around the trees. It was an amazing drive. We spent a lot of time here as it was beautiful. If you could only see one site in the park, this would be on the short list.On the way back we stopped at Simpson-Reed Grove and took a drive down Enderts Beach Road to Crescent Beach Overlook for a fantastic view of the coastline.

In reality, unless you wander the trails it is hard to really see many of the Redwoods and even then the views are not anywhere as nice as in the Humboldt Redwoods State Park south of Eureka.

Redwood National Park,"Spending time in nature always provides 2 benefits for me: Nature soothes me, slows me down and comforts me. With enough time, I find myself in synchrony with the landscape, and the world takes on a different perspective. Nature also humbles me. I can't visit places like Redwoods NP, Yosemite or the Grand Canyon without experiencing a extra dose of humility among grand and wondrous landscapes.My girlfriend and I stretched our vacation plans to include a short visit of 3 hours to Redwoods NP. With suggestions from rangers, we made good use of our time, hiking the Cathedral Trees and Elk Prairie trails in the Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park.We covered 3.5 miles, often with our heads tilted back and exclamations pouring forth: ""Look how beautiful."" ""Oh my gosh."" ""That's a big dang tree"" (repeated 12 times at least).Often, though, we stood silent in reverence. We felt ourselves in the presence of something sacred and magnificent, an ancient forest where life continues as it has for centuries.If you love to hike, don't be dismayed by a crowded parking lot at a park HQ or a trailhead. Most people don't venture far from their cars. During the heart of our casual 3.5 miles hike, we encountered very few people, mostly in ones and twos. The result is silence, beautiful silence! I don't know about you, but I can't fully enjoy a place like this with kids shouting, parents shouting, road traffic or other distractions. Only 8 percent of the original redwood forests remain. Thank goodness we have them, though, and Redwoods NP is a wonderful place to experience their glory.","July 18, 2012",Humility grows in the forest,9,"Orlando, Florida",5

Redwood National Park,"We spent one night in the park, and got great tips from the rangers on the best way to use our time. We stayed in a cabin by Elk Meadow, which was the perfect location, since several park attractions are a short drive. The rangers suggested sticking to the southern area - Prairie Creek and the National Park itselfWe hiked the trail at the Lady Bird Johnson grove early in the morning while the trees were still shrouded in mist. We were the only ones around, and the experience was surreal. Sadly our itinerary did not leave us time to explore the Tall Trees grove. We also drove to Fern canyon, which was exciting for me as a film buff, since parts of Jurassic Park 2 and Star Wars were filmed in there (no signage indicating specific spots though). The drive to fern canyon is along the coast for a part, and we also did some beach hiking. Though there is no fee to enter the national park, there was a fee to enter the fern canyon area and the beach adjoining it. In a short time, we were at least able to gain a perspective of the diversity and the sheer scale of this incredible place. We will certainly return and stay longer.","May 31, 2012",Spectacular,31,"Boston, Massachusetts",5

Redwood National Park,"Ancient GiantsThey will blow you away. There was a moment I literally weeped,. moved by how beautiful, tall, and big they are. No matter fire burns, lighting strikes, human cut their trunk to drive through, they just grow, and even they die, from their body other plants grow. What a lesson to learn.It is said in the book of “Telos” (channeling Adama, high priest of the 5th dimension city of Telos) that these Redwood trees came from the time of the lost continent of Lemuria, and it is because of these trees, their all connected branches and roots, the westen coast is protecte from storm and tsunami, unlike other coasts. Travel - I visited this territory of redwood for bigger and taller trees, easy trafic and coast views. You can reach them by either Crescent City airport from the north or Arcadia/Erica airport from the south. Make sure to get a detailed map with old growth trees from the nearst visitor center, as some old trees are on the high way parallel to 101 as you drive inbetween parks.Camping – You need to make a booking on their official website, but if you don’t have one, you may find some spots reserved for first come first serve, the best time to grab one is at 12 noon (check out time). No camping gear for rental on site or in town, but you can buy some cheap ones from Wallmart in Crescent City. A very good site for travel info is http://www.redwood.national-park.com/Make sure to visit Lady Bird Johnson reedwood park in the morning, the trees, the mist (fades towards noon), the light rays, make it a fairy land. A short loop trail behand the visitor center of Prairie Creek is also a must see.

They show how to tell the age of the tree, what caused differences in the rings of the tree trunk and how you can understand a bit of history from them.

In all of our hikes, in the park, south of the park, we saw either no one, or one or two people. The silence and majesty of the trees leaves one at a loss for words. One reviewer said Redwood National Park doesn't compare to Humboldt State Park or other state parks, but I disagree. We did the Lady Bird Johnson trail, which although not long, was my favorite of the many hikes we did and I thought easily beat Humboldt. Honestly though, you can't go wrong anywhere in this region! The trees are absolutely stunning. The park ranger at Orick was very helpful and pointed us to Lady Bird. I would have loved to go further in on that road, but we did not have the time. The trees on this trail are some of the biggest I've seen. Definitely take the time to go just a bit north and do the Drury Scenic drive--many good trails off of here, but the drive itself is breath-taking. If you can visit in winter I'd recommend it.

Redwood National Park,"We visited the redwood forest as part of our California road trip. We had been to the Muir Woods Sequoia forest the day before so it was interesting to compare this experience to that. The weather was gorgeous that day, warm and sunny with really bright blue skies, but the limited parking areas were full by the time we got there, well before noon. We had to park about a mile or so on the road and walk back, but it was free. The entrance fee to the forest is $5.00 per person. After paying that you can visit the gift shop, eat, drink, go to the restroom or just proceed into the redwood area. There is a whole different atmosphere upon entering the forest. It is a humbling, almost hushed attitude that the visitors have while in it. I looked around while walking the several miles that we did that day and there were people visiting from several nations. I could hear snippets of german, korean, italian, french and some indian and arabic dialects being spoken around us. After a mile or so inside the forest, there is a clearing where one can sit on a bench, reflect, take pics, etc., and where a park ranger gives a 15 minute talk on the history of the forest and how very difficult it is to grow a majestic redwood to maturity. A tiny redwood seed must go through a gauntlet of issues before it has a hope of becoming a fully mature tree. This was fascinating stuff to me. The natural beauty and history of this forest, on the day that we were there, was pretty much perfect.","September 17, 2011","A serene, calming walk through a natural forest",451,Frederick,5

Around some of the trees I felt like an ant. I had a hard time believing that these trees do not have deep roots. The roots are very close to the surface because water is close to the surface. Also, when a tree falls/dies another tree will grow out/around the fallen tree. See pictures below.","September 15, 2011",Absolutely breathtaking,24,Warrenton,5
Redwood National Park,"This is a DON'T MISS trip if you want to see some beautiful and incredible old redwoods! This past June, my family (from Florida) along with close family friends (from Oregon) drove south via #101 to Crescent City, CA in search of redwoods. Before I left from Florida, I read loads of reviews, including TripAdvisor, and Stout Grove Trail and the drive along Howland Hll Rd kept being mentioned as a need-to-see attraction. So, since our time was limited, that's what we did! There were 16 of us (3 vehicles) and our ages ranged from age 2 - 54 years. Everyone had a blast!!Stout Grove Trail and Howland Hill Rd. are free, accessible from Crescent City, CA and are in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park and Redwoods National Park. What makes Howland Hill Rd. amazing is you actually drive through these old redwoods! The 2-way gravel road is quite narrow and in some spots there's only enough room for one car to pass and the redwoods are so close you can touch them! That's what makes this trip so enjoyable and memorable! Whenever we wanted to pull over and get out to take photos, we were able to. Kids (and parents) were sticking their heads out of the windows and car doors to take it all in. The view was breathtaking.Along Howland Hill Road are many trails. We chose to stop and walk the short and easy Stout Grove Trail, which is actually a loop. By that time, the 10, 12 and 14 year old boys were getting antsy and needing to move! This was the perfect place for boys to be boys. Even the little ones had fun exploring and climbing on fallen redwoods. About halfway on the Stout Grove Trail, the park ranger told us of an umarked trailhead that would lead off of it down to the river. It was steeper than the main trail, but it was worth it. The kids skipped rocks at the river's edge and the view was gorgeous.All of us say that our redwood trip was the highlight of our Pacific Northwest Trip, even if it only consisted of 4 hrs. It packs a lot of punch for a few hours of free exploration. Even my Oregon friends, who usually go to The Trees of Mystery attraction to see redwoods LOVED this way more! Looking back, I wish we had additional time to spend hiking more trails off Howland Hill Rd. ... possibly spending a whole day there. This is a definite time to wear comfortable walking/hiking shoes and bring cameras, water and snacks (no concessions nearby). The one downside is the restrooms .... they smelled horrible! I braved it, but most of the gals opted to go behind a tree!! I recommend making a pit-stop before the drive!!","September 12, 2011",Stout Grove Trail and Howland Hill Rd. drive was favorite part of PNW trip!,21,Oviedo,5
Redwood National Park,I'm just going to point out some of the highlights of our trip in case it is helpful to anyone else. We stayed in the Ravenwood Motel in Klamath (& loved it but it is pretty isolated) then we spent a day travelling north & another day travelling south. Starting north on your park map & heading south: we would recommend the Howland Hill Rd. drive & the Stout Grove trail. You can walk over to the Battery Point Lighthouse but nearby is the Seal rescue center & you can walk around outside & see if they are re-habbing any animals & give them a donation for the awesome work they do. We liked the Yurok Loop trail and saw a bald eagle & we also did the Trees of Mystery. We drove the Newton Drury Pkwy & we did see some elk near the visitor center. We really liked the Fern Canyon trail (you can only hike it for a 1 mile loop if you want)--highly recommended but $8 per car load. We also liked the Trilium Falls Trail--we saw elk here too. These were our favorite things we did over 2 days. Good luck!,"September 6, 2011",Large trees--large park...,114,"Dayton, Ohio",5

It is not crowded, the trees are magnificent, and you can actually get close. We walked on two of the fallen giants and got a real impression about their height. If we will ever be in the area again, we will certainly stop again.","June 21, 2011",Amazing trees,128,"Berkeley, California",5
Redwood National Park,"The Redwood National Park was wonderful. I would visit the Cresent City visitor center before anywhere else. Stout Grove has the old growth trees. It is where you will find some of the largest and oldest trees in the park. There is also a river that you can hike down to in the Stout Grove section. There is only room for one car down the road to get to Stout Grove. The Rosevelt Elk are not that easy to find, but the visitor center can guide you in the right direction. We saw some, but we had to climb down a hill to view them. They were shy that day.If you like tide pools, go to the lighthouse in Cresent City at low tide. It is much better than standing on the rocks in the park. Even the Ranger told us that low tide in the park was not that safe. We were able to see several things in the water. Don't miss the seal rescue center( I don't remember the name, but it can be found on the internet). It is near the lighthouse. We did not have any luck at Kalamath Overlook, but it may have been the time of year that we went. On your way to Kalamath, stop at the Drive Through Tree. It was a fun little photo stop for a few bucks. We were told by our hotel that in order to find sandollars, you had to go out before daylight. We went out in the dark with headlamps on to find sandollars. When I went out in daylight early in the morning, the sandollars were covering the beach. I think that they wanted us to look dumb.","January 18, 2011",Amazing Trees,34,"Manassas, Virginia",5

Redwood National Park,"I'm going to start right off by admitting that I am a National Park junkie! Our family goal is to visit every park, and we already have about 20 done! That being said, Redwoods is a fabulous, highly-accessible experience. We stayed in the southern end for our hiking experiences because we were told it is less crowded, which was very true in August.We hiked the Trillium Trail at the suggestion of a ranger, and it was one of the best hikes we've done in awhile. We were almost immediately surrounded by an old growth forest that felt like being in a rainforest! It is hard to find a hike to yourself, but this one did it. We were the only ones on the trail. We saw people start before and after us, but had the trail to ourselves.We also hiked into Fern Canyon which was very different. Be aware that there is a bumpy road into the hike and a pay station for the CA State Park. It takes about 40 minutes to get in and out of the area. You are rewarded with great views and an isolated Northern Calif. beach. Great place to have lunch, and we also saw herds of elk right off the road. The hike is an easy scramble along a creek that is surrounded by walls of hanging ferns. There will be more people on this one, but it is worth the time!We also joined a ranger walk through the Lady Bird Johnson Grove. This one is very accessible for everyone. Easy trail with only a slight elevation change. The ranger was knowledgeable, and we learned a lot about the trees and environment. This is one of the hikes with a numbered brochure with lots of additional information.This was one of the parks that truly inspired us with the beauty and majesty of the trees and coastline.","August 14, 2010",Great Hikes and Awe-Inspiring Trees,93,California,5

After 15 minutes of roundabout speech from her. I accused her of lying to me and she confessed. She told me that she would not tell me where the sights are despite that it is a PUBLIC forest, funded by my taxes, and that I drove for 3 hours just to see those spots. I will never step foot in the information center office again and my attitude now is that the National Park Service people are useless.

Redwood National Park,"Our kids wanted to visit Redwood National Park for our family vacation over the summer. We didn't really know much about it, and did a lot of research online. We turned this into a week long road trip. We drove all along the California coast, and saw all of the state and national redwood and sequoia parks. We were a little worried about the kids (ages 9,7,4, and 2) getting bored, but they had so much fun. There were plenty of short hikes that were just right for their little legs. We found these by going to the visitor center at each park. The rangers were very helpful. My kids really enjoyed hiding in the burnt out trees, or ""tree caves"" as they called them. We also did some driving tours, so as not to wear out the kids completely. When the kids were done they could read a book or color in the back seat. No whining!! All of our excursions were kept to less than 1/2 a day; any longer than that would have burned out the kids. We made time to visit the beach. This was a new experience for my kids and they loved this aspect of our trip as well. They had fun playing in the tide pools and collecting shells along the beach. The weather was too cold to actually play in the water, but they still had fun.Be sure to bring a camera and warm jackets. It rained twice while we were there, but we had raingear, so we could hike in the rain. The park is on the coast, so it's cool and windy all the time, even in the summer. We packed pants and jackets; that seemed to be sufficient. We took plenty of pictures, but they just don't seem to do the huge trees justice. We stayed in hotels every night (only ones with a pool, for the kiddies). There were plenty of reasonable places to stay. We considered bringing our trailer and camping, but the cost of gas to and from California didn't make it cost effective. Overall, we had a great time. I'm sure my kids will remember this trip for many years to come. Now we are trying to decide which national park to visit next.","November 28, 2009",What a great family road trip!,11,Utah,5

Also, if you're addicted to your cell phone, be forewarned: you may not get a signal. But that's a good thing, isn't it?","October 26, 2009",Majestic,2,"Dayton, OH",5

Redwood National Park,"I attended a family reunion at a campout in the redwoods this past summer. The tall trees and beautiful rushing river made for a tranquil setting. The evening by the campfire, barbequing fesh salmon and singing old melodies will not soon be forgotten by all who attended. The parks in the redwoods have great accomodations an are clean.

Redwood National Park,"My family and I did a northwest road trip this past fall and I must say that it would not have been complete without a trip to the Redwood National Park. The trees are just indescribable. Yes, they are big, but it is so much more than that. To imagine how long it must take a tree to grow to those heights and widths, then you see the fallen ones and wonder what they have been through. In America, we don't have buildings from the thirteenth century, but we do have trees! There are plenty of hikes and even just walking trails. And those that are out along the ocean make for even more amazing photo opportunities. This is a must-see in your lifetime.","October 23, 2009",Breath-taking views and an experience you must have!,3,"San Diego, CA",5
Redwood National Park,"The northern CA coast is home to me and I visit this site regularly. All who see it leave with a new appreciation of ""tree huggers"" and why they work to save the huge old growth redwoods. It takes a small crowd holding hands and working together to embrace a giant. The drive along the coast to get there is another wonder to behold. Come see us!","October 23, 2009",Magnificent,1,California,5

Redwood National Park,"From the minute I enter a Redwood Forest an incredible sense of peace and calm comes over me. It reaches all five senses- you can feel it, breathe it in, see it, smell it, hear it. It's hard to describe but just remembering it brings the sensations back to me once again- right here in my office! Every time I visit I come away with a sense of renewal and rejuvination. It truly is my favorite place on earth.","October 23, 2009",My Favorite Place in the Universe!,21,"Cedarville, California",5
Redwood National Park,"I haven't been there since 1972, but this place took my breath away, even as a teenager. It was magnificent. You cannot comprehend the beauty or majesty of these great trees until you've stood next to them. I totally fell in love with this spot. Just knowing that they had stood there for centuries was awesome. Sorry I was too young and it was too long ago for me to offer tips about this park but it is well worth the trip. I hope to return someday with my husband.","October 23, 2009",Magnificent,8,"Columbia, SC",5
Redwood National Park,"Lady Bird Johnson Grove is “must see” in the Redwood National Park. The 1 mile trail is relatively flat and easy, composed of soft needles, leaves and mulch. There are some roots and rocks, but it is a very easy trail. Plan on at least an hour to walk the trail, longer if you walk slowly. I went early in the morning (9am) and had the trail to myself until the very end when more people started walking. It was an incredible experience walking among the towering trees and ferns. There are lots of great vistas and photo opportunities, but photographs do not convey the experience of walking this trail. Put your camera away and just enjoy walking among the redwoods. The parking area is paved and has restrooms but there are only about 20-30 parking spaces so get there early before it fills up.There are many other great attractions within the Redwood National Park. The Big Tree pullout also offers a very easy and flat trail to see the redwoods, along with an easy drive with redwoods right up to the road.","August 30, 2009","Peace, Beauty, Majesty",420,"Chesterfield, MO",5
Redwood National Park,"We just got back from the Redwood National Forest this past weekend and had an amazing trip. We camped in Elk Prairie/Prairie Creek and found it to be the far superior campground. We visited Jedediah & the Gold Bluffs campgrounds to compare and the bathrooms weren’t as good, the locations weren’t as close to as many trails & the trees weren’t as magnificent. We started our trip at Patrick’s Point where we went down to the tide pools and checked out all the creatures – snails, starfish, crabs, etc. It was really fun exploring. We hiked a few of the trails around Elk Prairie (I’m not sure of their names) and stumbled upon some great big beautiful trees, just in the backyard of our campsite. We also went to Tall Trees Trail where we spent some time relaxing by the creek (I would suggest bringing a picnic lunch there – no picnic tables, but it’s just gorgeous). Tall Trees Trail requires a semi-hard hike back up but well worth it! Another trail we took was Fern Canyon. This is a must do! Fern Canyon follows a stream back through the beautiful lush canyon of ferns. You need waterproof shoes or very steady balance as you regularly have to cross the creek on logs – which is a great adventure. We continued in Fern Canyon and did part of the James Irvine and Friendship trails. Both were nice, but we didn’t find anything too exciting on them. We also visited the Mystery of the Trees. The trees were actually not very impressive at all, but the Gondola ride up was nice and then hike down (only for experienced hikers) was a blast! You get to walk down using a rope… we thought that was pretty cool. We also went up to Simpson-Reed trail up north in Jedediah and enjoyed it… it was completely flat, so it was a nice change from all the inclines & declines of the other hikes. A note from our trip – we went the first week in June and Howland Hill Drive was completely closed M-F so we didn’t get to drive it or do Boy Scout Trail or Scout Grove, which we really would have liked to do. If you’re planning a trip in May or June you may want to call to see what week they’re planning to work on Howland Hill as it’s supposed to be awesome. Finally, we also did the Avenue of the Giants… it wasn’t all that different from other scenic drives around but we did make a stop off and enjoyed it. If you head up to the Redwoods – pack in layers, wear comfortable/waterproof shoes & bring a rain coat. Enjoy!","June 8, 2009",Breathtaking! Here are my must-dos...,29,"San Antonio, Texas",4
Redwood National Park,"While on my trip to northern California, I went up to Orick to see some Redwoods. They are truly breathtaking and beautiful. For a short and easy hike that will take you to trees you can climb inside of, try to stretch your arms around, and walk in between, all within a 1 mile trail - check out the Lady Bird Johnson Grove. I highly recommend it!","November 21, 2008",Check out Lady Bird Johnson Grove!,15,"New York City, New York",5
Redwood National Park,"At first I didn't know that the Redwoods is actually not just one place, but multiple places strewn down the California coast. I didn't know which one to go to, so I went to all three majors and a few of the offshoots.The best two drives were Howland Hill Rd out of Crescent City through the Jebediah Smith Redwoods. It is a moderately narrow washboard road that drives right through the thickest groves of redwoods and gives you fairly spectacular scenery without leaving your car. The scenery looks like something out of Jurassic park, with a floor of damp ferns and sunlight streaming occasionally thru the HUGE trees. You have to be very careful driving because the road literally wraps around the trees. But it isn't particularly steep, so not scary. About halfway through the drive is the parking area for the Stout Grove trail and the Boyscout tree.These are fairly flat paths that you can walk on a dirt trail through the underbrush. The other best drive is much further south, through the Avenue of the Giants. This is a fairly large well paved road that intertwines the highway and runs for miles through connecting groves of redwoods. Throughout it are several pulloffs to stop and hike a trail. Although there are several other roads that go through the redwoods, including hwy 101 iteself north of Crescent City, these two routes were my favorite.Prairie Creek, with its wandering herds of elk was interesting and had some easy trails at the info center, the big Newton B. Drury driving loop, which seemed popular for motorcycles, and various harder trails scattered around the forest with access by car. There, you can wander the easy paths at Cathedral trees and the so-called ""Big Tree"" (they were all pretty darn big to me).","September 8, 2008","So many redwoods, so little time, which to choose?",239,"Arlington, Texas",5
Redwood National Park,"To stand at the base of one of these gigantic trees is to experience heaven on earth. I am a little biased since I spent half my childhood living in California, but the redwoods still take my breath away and are certainly worth the trip to see them. If you are traveling with small children, or someone with disabilities, a trail that is easy to hike is at the Lady Bird Johnson Grove. It's a fairly steep drive up the hill, to the trailhead, though, so larger RV's are probably not recommended. You see a good sampling of just about everything on this short, relatively flat, trail.","January 20, 2008",Breathtaking Beauty,153,The NW,5

Redwood National Park,"My husband and I were able to hike this grove without difficulty. We are from the midwest (flat lands) and the description of the terrain in this grove was ""flat"". I would describe it as ""rolling"" but nothing awfully strenuous. It definitely gave us an opportunity to see these beautiful trees and enjoy an afternoon in a very peaceful environment. We visited in October so we met few other visitors on the trail.","November 3, 2006",Very peaceful and beautiful,163,RaceHorseLady,4
Redwood National Park,"Husband and I traveled through the area mid-May 2006. We came upon Howland Hill Road in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park by accident and decided to drive it. It is apporximately a 9 mile drive on an unpaved, severely pot holed road. It took about 2 hours with stops. It was amazing! Just such beauty and the trees were magnificent. Many places to stop, look, hike, picnic, whatever you may want to do. We weren't prepared to do any hiking so just stopped a lot to get out and look around and take pictures. I would not drive this in my own car. We were in a full size rental car with plenty of ground clearance. I would recommend renting a small SUV for the day to do this drive. The pot holes are many and you can only drive about 10mph so as to avoid them as much as possible. But they cannot be completely avoided and therefore, you need a car with ground clearance. The road is narrow at times and very narrow when someone is coming the other way, so a small SUV would be best. The driver is not able to fully enjoy the view because of the difficult road, so don't go with only one driver. My husband and I switched halfway through so we could both fully enjoy the tremendous beauty here.","May 24, 2006",Don't miss out on Stout Grove!,54,"Baltimore, MD",5
Redwood National Park,"My family of 5 (children ages 12, 7, and 3) went to the lower part of Redwoods National Park (not the more northern part up near Cresent City) in June 04. It was a really neat experience, and I'm glad the children have had an opportunity to see ""the tallest trees on Earth"". All roads to get there are winding and sometimes narrow. That gets a little old after a while (takes forever to get anywhere). We stayed in ""Motel Trees"" which is located just across the street from ""The Trees of Mystery"" (which are Redwoods that have grown in unusual ways--it is absolutely worth a visit if you're in the area). I recommend this hotel (Motel Trees) if you (expecially if you are with kids) are visiting the lower (and not as crowed) part of Redwoods Nat. Park. Good sized rooms with the hotel's own restaurant right there next door. The restaurant (though pricey) is decorated with a pond/forest theme that children really enjoy.","September 10, 2004",Nice to see--cool and foggy area with oh-so-tall trees,87,"Honolulu, Hawaii",4
