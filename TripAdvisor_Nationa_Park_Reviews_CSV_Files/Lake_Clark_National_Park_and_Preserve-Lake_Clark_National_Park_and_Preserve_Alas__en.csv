Lake Clark National Park and Preserve,Flew into Lake Clark for a half day of bear viewing. Got our wish. Saw several bears with babies. This was a great trip. The pilot who flew us there was outstanding and gave many details about the area.,"August 6, 2019",Trip to Alaska,43,,5
Lake Clark National Park and Preserve,"Floated the Tlikakila River for four days. We FLEW as the river was in high water. It was in early July and the rapids proved fun and delightful. The scenery was amazing, per usual Alaska!! We did see one grizzly, one moose and lots and lots of tracks of other critters. When the float plane landed we did have to hike quite a ways south in order to put the pacrrafts in. I recommend a pair of extra tuffs as your non drysuit boot. (or just wear those!!) we hiked through water while the boats pulled gear in the beginning. I look forward to heading back out to this area~but in the winter for some ski time fun.","October 4, 2018",Awesome float,2,"Valdez, Alaska",5
Lake Clark National Park and Preserve,"We spent two days in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve. On the first day, we took a float plane to Twin Lakes to visit Dick Proenneke's cabin. What a treat! I would highly recommend reading the book ""One Man's Wilderness"" before you go. The cabin was how I pictured it would but much closer to the water than I imagined. The hike up to Teetering Rock was very picturesque. It is one trip I will never forget.On the second day, we started at the NPS visitor center. There are displays, and also movies to watch. We did watch ""One Man's Wilderness"" to go along with our prior day trip. We then hiked from the visitor center to Tanalian Falls and Kontrashibuna Lake and back (via the Beaver Trail loop). It was a fairly easy and fantastic hike. We considered the mountain hike, but decided to take it easy with the more level hike and then rent a canoe in the later afternoon. This was a fantastic decision as the canoe rental (from the Farm Lodge) was fabulous on a sheet of glass lake.Definitely a hike worth doing. Some very beautiful views, the falls are gorgeous and powerful, and the lake a fantastic place to sit and have lunch.Enjoy this beautiful park!","September 19, 2018",Wonderful!,249,"Warrenville, IL",5
Lake Clark National Park and Preserve,Stayed at Silver Salmon Creek Lodge for bear viewing. Lots of options for day trips from the Kenia Peninsular if you can't stay. Beautiful landscape and lots of wildlife (including bears).,"August 24, 2018",Remote and full of bears,75,Oxford UK,5
Lake Clark National Park and Preserve,"One of the least visited national parks. No roads so you have to arrive by air or by boat. There are a few lodges located in or adjacent to the park. I believe you can also do a day trip by plane, not sure if a short visit by boat is available. Very scenic spot with a lot of wildlife including many bears. Weather will naturally affect your visit, but it is highly variable and changes within hours.","August 19, 2018",Remote but recommended,99,"Highlands Ranch, Colorado",5
Lake Clark National Park and Preserve,"Lake Clark National Park is one awesome place. My sons and I went for a day trip and it beat our expectations. This is one beautiful National Park. We took a six mile round trip hike to a waterfall and lake. Totally beautiful! I would go back in a minute. This is the real unspoiled Alaska,","May 26, 2018",Don’t hesitate just go.,105,"San Clemente, California",5
Lake Clark National Park and Preserve,"Went here on our Alaska National Park adventure. This place was awesome. We hit a day with perfect, while windy, weather. The lake is stunning and the bears were plentiful and constantly exhibiting their fishing skills. Saw lots of brown bears around the lake and were even treated to a black bear and cub. Very unusual to see both species so close together. This is a place you have to fly into but it is a once in a lifetime experience.","October 14, 2017","Remote, Beautiful National Park",184,"Lake Jackson, Texas",5
Lake Clark National Park and Preserve,Great national park very scenic and had fantastic bear sightings he entire week. Bugs and rain weren't bad at all but they certainly can be. ,"August 12, 2017",Beautiful Park,92,"Columbus, Ohio",5
Lake Clark National Park and Preserve,"The Lake Clark National Park is an absolute must see. The inhabited parts of the Preserve are less so. It can be a challenge and expensive to get there. The town of Port Alsworth is the most populous area out there and offers travelers a starting or ending spot for adventures. Gravel runways can be busy, dusty and loud - so be advised. Great hikes to Tanalian Falls and Lake Kontrashibuna. Beautiful scenery from the ground or air. NPS Visitor Center is well staffed, and very helpful with questions. Lots of wildlife, especially bears at Silver Salmon Creek.","July 13, 2017",Incredible ,543,"Denham Springs, Louisiana",5
