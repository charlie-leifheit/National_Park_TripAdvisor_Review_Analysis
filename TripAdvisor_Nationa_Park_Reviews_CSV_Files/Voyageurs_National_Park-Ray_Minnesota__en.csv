Voyageurs National Park,You can only see this special park by boat. We were there too early for a tour but were able to view ice still on the lake and watch the workmen preparing the launch. What spectacular scenery in this northern mist cold spot in the USA. Glad we made the trek!,"September 14, 2019",What a Unique Park,357,Crossett,5
Voyageurs National Park,"Such a different park from the other 20+ I've visited. Out of the way, few crowds, so much water and amazing views and vistas. ","September 4, 2019",What a park!!,1,"Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin",5
Voyageurs National Park,"We spent three days at the park and went on three boat tours - the Grand Tour, Kettle Falls and Ellsworth Rock Gardens. All three tours were interesting and we were able to see lots of eagles and loons. We saw a mommy loon and a chick -- and the mom was communicating with the chick -- so it was very cool. We hiked a few of the hikes; they were short. I found it fascinating to learn the history of the Voyageurs - boy were they tough! We stopped at all three visitor centers and the Ash River Visitor Center had a different film which really gave you a good overview of the Voyageurs and what they encountered and how they survived their journey. Pretty amazing. We totally enjoyed our stay. A beautiful park chock full of wonderful history. Definitely check out the contract the Voyageurs had to sign, the business managed by the Europeans, the Ojibwe Indians and how our international border was established.","August 29, 2019",Beautiful National Park,62,"Wantage, New Jersey",5
Voyageurs National Park,Just tooled around the islands in Kabetogama. Great campsites for midsummer when the woods are too buggy. ,"July 15, 2019",Island hopping,4,"Duluth, Minnesota, United States",5
Voyageurs National Park,We drove to the visitor center east of International Falls. I wish we had allowed more time for the visit and we would have taken the boat ride to see more of the lake and park. The boat had been totally booked the day we were there so I suggest you get reservations.,"September 8, 2018",Vast Park,54,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",5
Voyageurs National Park,"We took the Kettle Falls Tour from the Kabetogama Visitor center. It was a great way to see some of the park and learn about it, especially combined with the information at the visitor center.","August 31, 2018",Great tour,7,"Round Rock, Texas",5
Voyageurs National Park,What a great trip! We rented a houseboat for a week and toured the park with our family. The campsites were well maintained and away from everything. Bring Deet. ,"July 17, 2018",Nature at its best - and a night sky to remember!,14,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",5
Voyageurs National Park,"Voyageurs is the place for people who want to experience the Minnesota-Canada border waters without the hassles of a canoe trip. As a former BWCA guide I really enjoyed the park, which can teach the Boundary Waters a few things about campsite management. Sites have bear lockers, tent pads and better fire rings. What surprised us most was the lack of damage to sites. No stripped arch trees, human beaver marks on trees and beer cans in the latrine. Fishing is good, but the area is heavily fished. Get a Canadian license if you can. Much less pressure. The power boats can be aggressive, especially in narrows. The my boat's bigger than yours contest can reach absurd extremes. If you stay off the beaten path and go to more remote bays you will find yourself often alone and in fish country. The fishing maps sold on many sites are great navigation aids, but if you try to fish many of the recommended spots you will get run down and you won't catch fish.","June 15, 2018",A National Treasure,3,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5

Voyageurs National Park,"Voyageurs National Park is heaven for anyone who loves water and water activities. There are boat docks and boat tours, and there are campsites which are only accessible by water. There is fishing and camping for all levels of visitors. In October there are no mosquitoes; which we heard can be fierce earlier in the summer. The three visitor centers are well staffed and have exhibits that delight children. We saw signs for all kinds of rentals; canoe, kayak, boat, etc. Learn about the intrepid voyageurs who opened up this area and kept Europe supplied with furs.","October 31, 2017","If you love water, you will love this park",59,"Provo, Utah",5
Voyageurs National Park,We booked a boat tour on Rainy Lake at Voyageurs National Park. The visitors center and staff were great. The boat tour lasted 2 1/2 hours and was fantastic. Our Ranger Eric was knowledgeable and our pilot was John who did a superb job getting us close to bald eagles and other sights. ,"August 25, 2017",Beautiful Park,64,"San Antonio, Texas",4
Voyageurs National Park,What an amazing National Park! With the park being a water based park I thought it would be tough to enjoy! Boy was I wrong! The highlight was boating to locator trail and hiking back to the lakes and renting the NPS canoes for the day! The fishing was amazing and being the only people on the lakes was once in a life time dream!,"August 24, 2017",What an amazing Jewel in the NPS,76,"Scottsdale, Arizona",5
Voyageurs National Park,"There are 4 different entrances and visitor centers for the park ranging from Rainy Lake near International Falls on the west to Crane Lake near Orr at the south east end. The drive from one end to the other is about 4 hours including the side access roads. This is not designed to be a hiking park although there are some trails for the determined. Its main appeal is boating and fishing. Walleye is the main catch. Boats ranging from canoes to luxury houseboats available to rent everywhere. Some commercial portaging available. The lakes are big and easy to get lost in for the newbie. Donâ€™t go out without a good map and directions from local experts. Lots of island attractions including historical mining, fishing, and turn of the century resort buildings as well as picnic and full camping options. The Rainy Lake Visitor Center is the main VC so stock up on souvenirs there. It also has the big boat tour. These tours fill up ahead of time. For planning, the NP website is invaluable. The fisherman needs to be careful not to cross the boundary line to Canada unless he/she has a Canadian license. This is a great trip for outdoorsmen and women. Lots of eagles. Oh, lots of bugs inland too. Be prepared.","August 5, 2017",One more Bucket List check off!,27,"Lakewood, Colorado",5
Voyageurs National Park,"The Rainy Lake Visitor Center has three ranger led programs. The North Canoe tour is a hoot. This free canoe trip involves easy paddling and is a fun, entertaining hour or so. After the tour there is a led walk through the Ojibwa Camp and Ethno-botanical Garden. There is also literature so a self-guided tour can be taken. The Oberholtzer Trail is self-guided and has several options for length. The mosquitoes and deer flies can be quite ferocious. Bug repellent is a must. The Grand Tour navigates Rainy Lake in search of active eagle nests, views a former commercial fishing camp and takes a short stop at Little American Island with a 1/4 mile ranger led walk that explores the 1890's Rainy Lake gold rush. Repellent is another must here, too. The Kabetogama Lake Visitor Center is smaller and has the Echo Bay Trail, a self-guided walk with options for length. This walk is within the park and has no views of the lake. All in all, the Park is best viewed from a boat. There is world-renowned fishing and boating.","July 23, 2017",Beautiful scenery ,65,,3
Voyageurs National Park,"My wife and I just spent two days in Voyageurs National Park and we loved it. The first day was all by land, hiking a variety of trails near two of the four visitor centers. The second day was all by sea (or lake really). The trails are very nice, albeit very buggy in the summer. But hey, this is northern Minnesota and you already knew that. Here's our itinerary (we were there July 4th weekend):Day 1:Hiking at Ash River region:-Blind Ash Trail: Must do, just under 3 miles, starts near the Ash River Visitor Center, lush forest, trail leads to great lake views. Our favorite hike of the trip.-Beaver Pond Trail/Overlook: easy short trail to a great view point-Voyageurs Forest Trail/Overlook: about a half mile trail, close to park entrance Would have done the Kab-Ash Trail as well, but the thunderstorms rolling in prevented us. The Park Ranger at the Ash River Visitor Center said this was her favorite trail in the park.Hiking at Rainy Lake region:-Oberholtzer Trail: 1.7 miles, more lush forest, no lake views, two loops within the out-and-back trail-Ethno-Botanical Garden Trail: very short easy walking area near visitor center-Rainy Lake Recreation Trail: 3.5 miles round trip, but we only completed about half due to weather. If you have a bike, this is a nice easy ride.Day 2:We took the nearly 6 hour boat tour to the Kettle Falls Historic District from the Kabetogama Visitor Center (book your reservation at the recreation.gov website beforehand). During the two hour trip to Kettle Falls, we saw about a dozen bald eagles and were provided facts about the area and wildlife by the park rangers leading the tour. Then we got to spend two hours at the hotel and surrounding area in the historic district. It is one of the only places in the lower 48 that you can look south and see Canada. After a short walking tour of the hotel and to a dam, we returned to the visitor center. If you come to Voyageurs without a boat of your own, it behooves you to take this tour. If you aren't seeing this park by boat, you just don't get the full experience of what Voyageurs has to offer.The one thing I found odd about this park is that many of the Park Rangers are very new and weren't able to provide much information. For example, the Ranger I spoke with at the Kabetogama Visitor Center never even hiked the one trail (Echo Bay Trail) that is near the visitor center. She said that the other ranger working also hadn't hiked it yet. How is it possible to be a park ranger in a National Park and you still haven't hiked a trail? Shouldn't that be mandatory for your position? Or better yet, shouldn't you want to?If looking for motels close to the park, check out International Falls, Orr, Virginia, or Eveleth.","July 21, 2017",Awesome and Secluded National Park!,44,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",5
