Grand Teton,"Growing up I visited the smokey mountains with my parents, the Teon Range is much different. The Teton range is saw toothed, they are snow capped. You don't drive through them, they are tall, steep, rugged, more something you scale.","October 15, 2019",Grand Teton,1143,"Coral Springs, Florida",4
Grand Teton,Looking back now a month after I visited I am wondering if it was all a dream but thankfully I have the photos to remind me. However long you have to explore this wonderland it will never be enough. I didn't allow as much time as it deserves but it will still be there for future visits. The only negative is that there is now no discount for visiting both Grand Teton and Yellowstone while the accommodation all around both parks is very expensive making a return visit a financial challenge but one definitely worth making.,"October 14, 2019",Magnificent!,47,"Huddersfield, United Kingdom",5
Grand Teton,The Tetons are some of the most beautiful mountains I've seen in America. They are a tall rugged looking mountain range. ,"October 14, 2019",Stunning views,81,"Clayton, North Carolina",5
Grand Teton,"Entering Grand Teton through the north entrance from Yellowstone, you will need to drive a short distance before seeing the mountains. When I was there, clouds covered the mountain peaks. Stop at various areas provided for sites and look at lakes, nature and more. Take it all in and don't forget to bring your phone and camera with you. The whole park can be driven through, in a matter of hours, 2.5-3; longer of you want to take numerous photos. Speed limit is mostly 45. ","October 11, 2019",Mountains and more,7,"Lincoln, Nebraska",4
Grand Teton,"Loved the fresh pine air, bright sun, and contrasting colors of the valley and early Fall colors. Roads were easy to drive. Saw some moose, many elk (especially at dusk). I've read a lot about the early trappers and explorers of the reagin and following the Snake River was beautiful! Took a rafting trip with a guide. It was fun and safe One of America's prettiest Mountain Ranges","October 11, 2019","Beautiful contrast of sky and valley, and the Snake River",1,"Port Washington, United States",5

Grand Teton,"We had 3 full days to tour Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks while staying in Jackson. First day we did Grand Teton and loved it. Had planned to spend next 2 days in Yellowstone, but after day 1 (see my review) we decided we'd rather spend our remaining day in Grand Teton. Awe-inspiring mountains, very little traffic/people, much more and more varied wildlife. The hike around the S end of Jenny Lake to Moose Ponds took maybe an hour and was a perfect short hike that let you see the lake from many angles. The second day we ventured over to Bridger-Teton National Forest after we photographed the famous Mormon barns on Antelope Flat Rd and loved it as well. Between GT National Park and the National Forest, we saw elk, antelope, deer, moose, and an eagle.","October 8, 2019",Beats Yellowstone hands down,31,"Houston, Texas",5
Grand Teton,"Sadly on the day we visted there were heavy clouds so much of the upper part of the mountains was covered up. However what we could see was amazing, and the occasional time we saw the peaks they were truely grand. Pair that with ample wildlife and numerous quality pullouts with information and stories made this an amazing park to visit and lifelong memories. ","October 8, 2019","Even on a cloudy day, the beauty of this place was evident.",0,"Mankato, Minnesota",5
Grand Teton,"Beautiful place to find nature by hiking, biking, kayaking or just sight seeing. It's a great place to look for animals in their natural habitat: elk, deer, pronghorn, bison, bear, eagles, hawks and much more. ","October 7, 2019",Wonderful Place for an Outdoor Experience,4,,5
Grand Teton,"This has to be one of our most beautifully pristine National Parks with the magnificent Teton Range and glistening lakes. It covers over 300,000 acres and is home to countless species of indigenous flora and fauna. Higher elevated mountains still have small glaciers, the Snake River wends its way through the Park, and some of the oldest rocks have been found here, dating back about 2.7 billion years.We entered at the Moran Entrance and within a couple of minutes we came face to face with Jackson Lake. This is a great photo stop as Mount Moran with its tiny glacier reflects beautifully in the lake. The topography of the Park is interesting in that the land is very very flat with the mountains suddenly rising sharply and majestically.We stopped at the Craig Thomas Visitor Center where the staff was friendly and helpful and there were interesting exhibits. There are over 200 miles of hiking trails, and there is some good fishing, especially for trout. Camping is available. This is a very beautiful, well maintained Park.","October 6, 2019",Pristine Beauty ,286,"Springfield, Massachusetts",5
Grand Teton,We had a wonderful early Breakfast at Headwaters Lodge and then entered the Park from the North. It was before sunrise and the scenery was absolutely magnificent!! The park is much smaller than Yellowstone but even more beautiful. We did as many trails as we had time for and loved the beautiful scenery from each one.,"October 6, 2019",Lovely to see!!!,23,"Munich, Germany",4
Grand Teton,"We toured a number ofnational parks on this trip. While this park is onthe small side, it ws perhaps esiest to view the stunning scenery - many pull-puts, relativley flat drives, moutains clearly visible. My sense is that this might be the easiest of the grand parks for the handicapped to view the magnificant scenery of the mountains.Very nice visitor centers at the various entrances. The park staff are uniformly firneldy, helpful, and professional.What amazed me - we tried to drive through Yellowstone on the way from West Yellowstone town, and reversed course quickly when we hit the traffic jam up. (Please people - try to pull of the road if you need to stop for the mega-fauna photo!) We drove through the towns outside of the park instead, which were their own interesting scenes.","October 5, 2019","Gorgeous scenery, easy to see",540,Wisconsin,5

Grand Teton,The mountains are so big and majestic. Numerous points to view them from varying angles. Trails to be taken. Jenny Lake area was very beautiful. The drive up a narrow road to Signal Mountain Summit was amazing and the view of the valley below can't be beat. The only negative was how crowded it was. I can't imagine how it would be at the peak of the tourist season. One of the best memories of my old life.,"September 24, 2019",Captivating,47,"New Castle, Indiana",5
Grand Teton,"If you visit Yellowstone and miss coming to the Grand Tetons then you have made a mistake. There mountains simply stunning. My words, my pictures, my oral descriptions fail to adequately convey the majesty of this area. Although we didn’t officially take the 42 mile loop we did see quite a bit of it and it never failed to see us. Go see for yourselves.","September 24, 2019",A must visit. ,267,"Louisville, Kentucky",5
Grand Teton,During our last visit the weather in July was snowy and windy making for an unpleasant experience since we hadn't prepared ourselves for such cold weather. This time our September visit was cool with a couple days of rain but the Grand Teton National park showed off splendidly during periods of sun. Rugged beauty was admired while revisiting the park twice around the 42 mile loop park road. Saw everything on my to-see list. If given a chance I would stay here again. ,"September 24, 2019",More magnificent than last visit,497,"Gatesville, Texas",5

Grand Teton,"That's what Theodore Roosevelt said about them and they are spectacular. We visited the middle of September. It was quite busy but not overly crowded. We were among the first at trail parking in the morning around 8:30 although the lots were mostly full when we left.We did day hiking, mostly lake trails and Cascade Canyon. We also enjoyed an evening float trip down the Snake River. We enjoyed the visitors centers and stores at Jenny Lake and Colter Bay. We walking around the historic Jackson Lodge but stayed at the more intimate Signal Mountain lodge which was centrally located and no more than 20 minutes from trailheads.Saw lots of wildlife including ravens, eagles, mule deer, bull moose, pika, chipotle, squirrels, waterfowl, black bear, pronghorn, elk and beavers. We stayed four nights in park which allowed us to see and do everything we wanted.","September 22, 2019",What Mountains are Supposed to Look Like,98,Midwest,5

Grand Teton,"Grand Teton National ParkIn the western part of mountainous region of United States sits its 44th state Wyoming which is tenth largest yet least populated one. Here the Great Plains meets the Rocky Mountains: actually it is a great plateau broken by mountain ranges. The eastern third of the state is high elevation prairie called the High Plains while the Rocky mountains and rangelands cover western two-third of the state. In the northwest of Wyoming sits the Grand Teton National Park. It encompasses the Teton mountain range, the 4,000-meter Grand Teton peak [the second highest peak in the state ], and the valley in the north is known as Jackson Hole.The Teton Range in the northwest extends for 50 miles (80 km). The Continental Divide that spans north-south across the central portion of the state, forks in the south central part of the state in an area known as the Great Divide Basin where the waters that flow or precipitate into this area simply sinks into the soil or evaporates.During June to September the weather remains a pleasant mild to warm and dry. So when we set off, after hiring a car from AVIS at Jackson Hole for 5 days, we’re spell bound by the towering mountains laced with glaciers and sweeping green valleys and vast stretches of rangelands. Even some ranches do not spoil the view simply because, it is a park of epic proportion.The park has numerous lakes, including 15-mile-long (24 km) Jackson Lake as well as streams e.g. the upper main stem of the Snake River. A dozen small glaciers persist at the higher elevations near the highest peaks in the range. Dozens of species of mammals, 300 species of birds, more than a dozen fish species and a few species of reptiles and amphibians inhabit the park.With more than 1,000 drive-in campsites, Grand Teton National Park is a popular destination for mountaineering, hiking [over 320 km of hiking trails], fishing and other forms of recreation.","September 20, 2019",GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK where grandeur weds splendor,22,,5

Grand Teton,"Grand Teton national park was definitely the highlight of our trip. We had originally planned to spend a couple of days here before moving on but ended up spending over a week here exploring the different lakes and trails and taking part in numerous activities. If you are an outdoor enthusiast, love mountains, animals and spectacular views then you really won't be dissapointed. We visited the Tetons after visiting Yellowstone and found them to be more spectacular and less infested with busloads of tourists, and much more accessible in terms of getting around. That said, we also loved Yellowstone, this was just better!","September 18, 2019",The highlight of our trip,2,"London, United Kingdom",5

Grand Teton,"We stayed one night in the main lodge and two nights in Jackson. We enjoyed our time in the park - the views are spectacular, even with some cloud cover. We did a Snake River float trip, which was fun and a great way to experience the park and see things from a different perspective than from the observation points along the road. Enjoyed our time in the park.","September 14, 2019",Spectacular scenery!,46,Michigan,5
Grand Teton,"This is my happy place, so I’m reluctant to share it with everyone as I don’t want it to end up as crazy/ popular as Yellowstone National Park. I’ve loved this place since I worked at Jackson Lake Lodge years & years ago. While I’m not able to enjoy all the hiking trails anymore due to bad knees, I try to get up here as often as I can just to relax, take in the beautiful surroundings and chill. Even city folk will be glad that they experienced the Tetons and were able to see some wildlife in their natural habitat. It’s just Breathtaking!","September 14, 2019","Beautiful forest, mountains and wildlife. Less hectic than Yellowstone!",0,"Scottsdale, Arizona",5

Grand Teton,"Spent about two days here in mid-August when the crowds have thinned (just) a bit. Scenery is beyond description. Parking at popular spots like Jenny Lake can still be a problem. The Jenny Lake visitor center somewhat disappointed with lack of exhibits. The Moose Visitor Center had a movie and very interesting exhibits. Rangers were very knowledgeable and helpful. Little luck on day 1 in spotting animals. Only bison and one bear in the distance, nothing close. Day 2 saw an elk herd from a distance and a bald eagle over one of the rivers.","September 9, 2019",Awesome park,99,,5
Grand Teton,"I have traveled the world and rarely do you find yourself able to get close up to mountains with a town or village at the foot, but in the Tetons you can. And it is wonderful. Well worth a picnic with a view; stop and take it in. I also must say our National Parks are well maintained and staffed.We went looking for wildlife, in a safe way, and we found it. Bear, moose, antelope, bison and more. Drive with awareness. We were there in mid-June and the lakes had lost their ice only a week before.We opted to not go to Yellowstone and just enjoy the Tetons and area.","September 8, 2019",Amazing and close,21,"Boulder, Colorado",4

Grand Teton,This park wasn't originally on my list of places to visit but ended up being the best way to spend the day. I only had one day to do the park so we road the entire loop and it was all great. Couldn't beat the views and all the different little spots and angles for viewing the mountains and lakes. For large panoramic photographs and views I think this park beats out it's Yellowstone Neighbor. I would highly recommend spending at least a day here.,"September 7, 2019",You can't beat these views,121,"Nashua, New Hampshire",5

Grand Teton,"The admission fee for Grand Teton National Park is paid at the entrance gate. There have been 2 places that I have visited that just took my breath away. The first was Devil's Tower and this is the second. (For the record, I have been to the Grand Canyon and Mount Rushmore and neither of them had the impact of the Tetons.) There are amazing vistas--Jenny Lake is spectacular--picnic areas, camping, visitor centers and pretty much anything you would expect at a major national park. Most people want to see Yellowstone, but on your way there, this is a worthwhile stop.","September 6, 2019",Awe inspiring vistas,128,"Anaheim, California",5
Grand Teton,"How anyone can give this an average rating must not have experienced all the Tetons have to offer. So many ways to experience these mountains, the mountain lakes around them and the interesting history of how the Park formed, the life the Snake River brings to the area and the abundance of wildlife. There are so many pictures already posted, no need to post more, you just have to experience it, nothing matches. I will say that for those that are not total outdoors people (my wife), you may decide you have seen enough in two days if you can not experience the hikes.","September 6, 2019",Amazing and Majestic,121,"San Diego, California",5

Hiking the trails through the wildflowers and taking in the epic views was simply priceless and amazing. We are so lucky to have national parks, they offer so much and preserve our beautiful outdoors and wildlife.

We saw a moose and calf at Moose Pond near Jenny Lake. We also saw numerous antelope throughout the park.We loved Grand Teton but would not recommend unless you also did Yellowstone. We live in Massachusetts so it was a long way to travel. We did two days in Grand Teton and five days in Yellowstone.

We had carefully read other's reviews and recommendations and had carefully planned the trip. This was well worth it. While the park apparently has large crowds, it is large enough to easily avoid people. The best decision we made in our planning was to get up early enough to be in the park at 7, especially for the more crowded hikes, like Jenny Lake.

We tried to see as much as we could so we exited Yellowstone via the East Gate with another memorable drive through Shoshone National Forrest. Anyway, Grand Teton, located in Wyoming and very far from any big town, offers beautiful scenery, camping and relaxation for the visitors. The park has fees just like Yellowstone, and it is better to buy an annual pass to visit both.

Grand Teton,"We stopped in the Grand Teton park on the way to and from Yellowstone. It's a very majestic looking park due to the mountain range. Especially with the views of the mountains in the background behind various lakes. I suggest that you carry Bear Spray with you if you are hiking. There are more bear in Teton than in Yellowstone from what I understand. You will find moose near the marsh areas. There is an Elk refuge on highway 191 coming out of Jackson heading North. Our favorite hike was up to Lake Taggart. Plenty of people, not a difficult hike either, and a beautiful environment. There are maps online from the national park service for Teton.","August 23, 2019",Majestic Park,37,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5

Grand Teton,"We came here after visiting Yellowstone NP to continue our wildlife scouting adventure as well as to witness the most beautiful mountain range in America. And it truly is stunningly beautiful. Just when you think you have taken enough pictures of it, then another view or angle or nuance made by light or clouds just take your breath away and there you are taking the millionth picture of it. I was surprised however that more wildlife was not teeming the plains as we drive through and around the park. Coming from Yellowstone's famous Lamar and Hayden Valleys where majestic bison roam the fields in herds and wander solo unafraid of cars and human bystanders, I admit feeling deflated about not seeing much wildlife stand out in the miles of sagebrush. On a couple of occasions we saw 1 prong horn in the fields, hardly the herd we see grazing or resting in Lamar Valley. And this experience was true no matter what time of day we were driving out there, even during the prime time of wildlife viewing which is early morning before the August sun really heats things up.But we were okay with all of this because on this trip we were scouting out moose. Based on our experience of scouting areas around the park starting from the wee hours of the early morning to evening, this is a review of the places we scouted:1) Gros Ventre (pronounced Gro-Vaunt): This is where we saw moose during our 4 day stay in Grand Teton. Take 191 North from Moose Junction and make a right onto Antelope Flats Road and the road turns down around past Mormon Row again to drive you along the Gros Ventre river. I believe it was the first overlook parking area where the street is closest to the river and gives you an open view of the opposite bank and forestation along the river. This place was referred to us by a ranger who lives near the location and usually sees 3 young bull moose here. A tourist who visits each year also referred this place. Judging by the many tourists and photographers that showed up here at dusk, this was the place to see moose.And hooray, we saw our first moose here! We saw a mama moose and her calf relaxing in the willows by the bank of the Gros Ventre River around 3:00pm. We also saw a coyote run across the street from the river back up the hill. Then a couple of days later, we saw our first bull moose across the river around 5:00pm. He stayed close to the shade and ate leaves and would just sit and rest out of sight until he got up again to eat. We hoped he would come out further to drink from the river but he didn't. He was still there at nightfall when we left.2) Moose-Wilson Road: No luck for us here. We visited this place at 6 or 7 in the morning and drove to the look out point where there was a stream and heavy forestation on the opposite bank. The overlook parking area was extremely noisy with gravel and traffic. We drove down the bumpy road and followed the road down til we turned out and nothing. Rangers and the internet have mentioned this road as a good place to see moose but not for us.3) Swabacher Road: Also no luck here but very beautiful area. Located a little north of Moose Junction on 191 in between Glacier and Teton overlook points, you pull into this road which you will follow down where there is parking by a rest room out-house. Then take a walk along the river where some parts look very marshy and looks like perfect habitat for moose but none were spotted here. A woman who frequents Grand Teton each year told us to come here as moose was spotted here before but again no luck for us here. We came here in the morning and late afternoon and nothing. Very picturesque view of Grand Teton here.4) Oxbow Bend: North on Teton Park Road and make a right at Jackson Lake Junction. Travel books have mentioned this place but we did not see any moose here.Although we only lucked out with only 1 of these four places, try them all out when you go just in case you get lucky. We found that seeing them at dusk is not exactly true since our sighting happened between 3-6pm. Have patience and be willing to wake up early and brave the late afternoon heat to seek them out. If you can, invest in good binoculars or a telescopic lens for your camera. But anything is better than nothing.

This park is a good way to ease into the experience if you are approaching from the south. Smaller, with fewer, if any, geothermal features, the hiking is fun, views spectacular, and wildlife easy to see. Construction on one of the main roads has slowed traffic this summer, so take the side road past Jenny Lake and enjoy the slower pace while getting a close up view of what this park has to offer. You will pass the learning center, Jenny Lake (get there early to find a parking spot and take an early ferry across), and then meet up with the main road to go by Jackson Lodge (beautiful photo spot off the back deck).

How could mountains be so spectacular? Let me tell you. The first time I came around the corner and saw them in their majesty, my jaw absolutely dropped. I could not understand how I had never been here before that day, and vowed it would never happen again. We were there in October, and I quite honestly can't imagine a more stunningly beautiful time to experience the vibrant colors of the trees paired with the crisp blue of the sky. The weather was perfection, and the crowds were manageable. Granted, some of the areas of the park were closed for the season, but that was ok with me.

We paid $200 for a 2.5 star motel.","June 8, 2019",Pot luck in a beautiful place.,66,"Sydney, Australia",4
Grand Teton,Spent couple nights here in Colter Bay cabin and absoutely loved it. Bucolic setting which is beautiful beyond words. We enjoyed a few hikes and a scenic raft trip which departed Jacksin Lodge. Church of the Transfiguration- a small chapel over a hndred years old- was a very moving experience. Saw moose and calf out in front of it. Short ride into Jackson Hole for dinner was fun and spotted lots of wildlife on our return ride at dusk. Having been to most of our large national parks- this one is truly spectacular- have to see it in person. Liked the smaller scale and no crowds in May. Taggart Lake is a nice hike and there was snow but it was very manageable to hike through.,"June 7, 2019",Loved our stay,120,"New York City, New York",5
Grand Teton,"This is a great park for driving and viewing all of the beautiful mountains and lakes. We saw an Elk up clos,e next to the car and buffalo off in the distance. We also saw a coyote cross the road. The park is small enough that you can drive around the whole park, stop and take pictures, etc. all in one day. There were lots of trail heads but it was too cold for us to hike in mid may (snow on the ground).","June 7, 2019",Great Scenery and wild life,3,"Melbourne Beach, Florida",5

Grand Teton,"Christian Pond Trail is east of Jackson Lodge and connected to Two Ocean and Emma Trails. It is a 3.6 mile trail with elevation of about 260 ft with a couple of somewhat step inclines. The trail starts at the Jackson Lodge service station/corral. They run horse trips on the same trail so you will need to look out for horse dropping long the way. The trail winds thru some pine tree areas but is mainly thru big sage meadows. Along the way you gets some great views of the tetons jutting out along the hills and trees. You of course past the Christian pond which had about 20 ducks on it when we passed as wells as a number of other water areas. We didn't see any significant animals just a few pretty birds, the ducks and geese. If you are out for a not too long hike and don't mind the horse droppings it is a nice option. The parks newspaper had a nice map of this trail that you should take along as a guide.","June 1, 2019",Christian Pond Trail,125,"Grand Junction, Colorado",3

But I saw on a map that they basically shared a border and decided that on our way back to the SLC airport we would drive through. If you are not a hiker, there was not much to do.

Grand Teton,"We visited the park the first weekend of May and entered through the Granite Canyon entrance on the south end of the park. There wasn't much to see until we got to Moose entrance and the Visitor Center. The gate to the Laurance Rockefeller Preserve was closed so that was disappointing. We visited the Craig Thomas Visitor Center and looked around, visited the gift shop and took a few pics before entering the park again at Moose. This is where you can really see the magnitude of the Tetons.We drove up to Jenny Lake and stopped in to take some pictures - it was beautiful! The lake was still frozen and there were some great photo opportunities.We proceeded up to the Signal Mountain Summit and took in the views before arriving at the Jackson Lake Dam and observed quite a few people fishing. We took some more pictures hoping to get a good one to make into a print at home.Overall it was a good experience and we are glad that we stopped in but it was definitely the end of the off season and many things along the way were closed. Our thought is the park is more for avid bikers and aggressive hikers which is not us. Glad we experienced it though and we would totally recommend it for the views! We also appreciated that the park was not crowded and we were able to go at our own pace and it was beautiful and relaxing.","May 9, 2019",Beautiful!,70,"Reno, Nevada",5
Grand Teton,"We stayed in Jackson Hole a few years ago and planned to see Yellowsone. But we were there in the first part of May so we descovered that the south entrance to Yellowstone was closed. The west gate was open but it was a 4 hour drive so we decided to explore the Gran Tetons instead. We saw a lot of wildlife, including moose, buffalo, prong sheep and assorted birds and squirrels. The drive through the Tetons was really pretty, great for pictures and it wasn't crowded at all. The weather was so nice I put on shorts and a T-shirt. This was probably my favorite vacation we have been on, lots to see and things to do. Next time we would probably wait a few weeks so we could see Yellowstone but our vacation turned out great anyway.","May 6, 2019",Great Vacation,8,"Florence, Oregon",5
Grand Teton,"We have been to the Tetons many times before, but this was the first so early in May. We arrived on May 1st, and found that the park was still in winter mode. Although all of the major roads were open, there was still a lot of snow, and while in the park we were hit by blizzard conditions. Needless to say it was very cold and windy. While we could make out some of the peaks through the clouds, the stunning views that we came for were not there. Partly bad luck of course, as each year and day will be different. And, on previous visits a bit later in May, we saw LOTS more wildlife than we saw on this visit. All we saw this time were distant herds of elk, two lone elk closer to the road, and several groups of pelicans on the river. You might get lucky, but this visit, for us, was close to a waste of time. We strongly suggest that you wait until later in May, or until winter conditions have ended. You will be rewarded with spectacular views of the mountains, and with patience and luck, sightings of bear, buffalo, elk, and so much more. It is truly a special place on Earth when the conditions are right. September is our favorite time, and the best time to visit the park.","May 5, 2019",This review is for April and early May visits only.,60,"Caldwell, Idaho",3

Grand Teton,"We had an excellent time visiting the Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Park. In order to maximize your time and not be driving all over, it is best to go with a tour guide. We used Buffalo Roam and the 4 of us constituted a group and had our own van and driver. He was very knowledgeable about the two parks, which we did in two days (no, do not try to cram the two parks in one day, that would not be a good thing).","April 15, 2019",Lots of things to do and see,4,"Pleasanton, California",5
Grand Teton,"After spending 5 days in Yellowstone we took a short drive to Grand Teton for 4 days in early October 2018. We came with the mindset that the park would be less crowded and the autumn colors would be at their peak and the Park did not disappoint. ""Yellows and reds painted the sleepy brown woods"" and I wondered if we'd ever go home. Grand Teton is breathtaking. The mountain range is mesmerizing. Grand Teton is not as well travelled as the other big National Parks so you can really get away from it all. Especially during the autumn months. No traffic, no lines, easy to get a table in restaurants and the some of the stores have end of season sales. We did some hiking and a lot of driving. We did so much hiking in Yellowstone and driving seemed more appealing in Grand Teton. Definitely take a drive up Signal Mountain. It's an easy drive up a winding mountain road. Once at the top, you'll want to bring a camera and stay a while. Definitely drive to Jackson Hole for the day and when you do, instead of taking the highway, Be Sure To Take Moose Wilson Road if weather permits. You will thank me I promise!!! It's a beautiful small winding road that cuts through the mountain. During the early October, the road is a-blazed with autumn colors and there's a look out point where you can usually see a family of moose feeding in the evening around 5 pm. But be mindful of the time because you don't want to drive that road at night. We also saw a bear from our car. Definitely take tram in Jackson to the top of the mountain where there's world class skiing in the winter. There's a little cafe up there with really good waffles and hot cocoa. We cruised around the top of the mountain for a couple of hours them took the tram back down. While there we saw this girl in about her 20""s hiked to the top. She only had water and bear spray. Ah to be young again. This is an absolute magical place. We loved every second of our visit. ","April 9, 2019",Autumn Colors a-blazing ,14,"Waikiki, Hawaii",5
Grand Teton,"We went to the park in August 2018. It was an awesome experience and I wish we could've stayed longer! There are plenty of things to see and do in the park. There's some amazing hikes ranging from easy to strenuous. To access the trails from Jenny Lake, I recommend arriving super early in the morning during the busy summer months because the parking lot is often full by mid-day! Staying at the Jenny Lake Campground would be an even better option as you can access the trails a short walk from the campground. Again, if you want to get a spot here, I recommend arriving early as well! We came around noon so the campground was full and we stayed at the Signal Mountain campground instead. Still incredibly scenic, like basically everywhere in the park, but less convenient in terms of accessing the hikes we wanted to do. Other activities in the park include boating and cycling. There's also plenty of wildlife to be found-we saw bears, deer, and elk. Make sure to get some pictures but keep a safe distance from the animals!","March 24, 2019",So much to see!,7,"Aurora, Canada",5

Grand Teton,"We did this trip back in early June 2018. We had a great time and hopefully we could go back after a few years. I have been reading posts on here to get idea and information while planning the trip. I recently joined the forum so I just want to share the experience. This was our itineraries. We booked everything 1 year in advance. Took an evening flight to Salt Lake City around 9PM. Got the SUV rental. Drove to Brigham City (1 hour from the airport). Stayed overnight at the Holiday Day Inn Express (recommended- fairly new hotel). Day 1: Left hotel at 8AM. Drove to Jackson Wyoming via Logan Canyon and Bear Lake. WE stopped at Bear Lake for pics. Unfortunately it was hazy that day so we couldn’t see its famous turquois water .This scenic drive is beautiful and we were glad we did. Got to Jackson around 1PM. We checked in at the Ranch Inn Hotel in downtown Jackson. Then we drove to Teton Village. Took the aerial tram to Mt.Rendezvous (buy tickets online in advance to save some money). We went to an Albertson Supermarket after that to buy snacks and waters. Explored the town. Day 2: Left the hotel around 8AM. Heading to Grand Teton Visitor Center. OMG! You can see the Teton mountain range from the Visitor Center. It is awe-inspiring. We bought the Annual Pass- The America Beautiful. Got the map then we did the 42 Miles loop. It is just like out of the world and we have only been at the Grand Canyon (South and West entrance last year) before this trip. Stayed overnight at Jackson lake Lodge. You need to spend money to stay at this place at least one night. I could stay at the lobby and stare at the window all day. Dinner at the Mural Room was great. We used the pool (it was heated). Day 3: Breakfast at the Mural Room again. We did the Buffet option because we don’t plan to do lunch. Heading to Yellowstone via South Entrance. We drove pass West entrance and then we start making stops based on the map to Mammoth Hot Springs. Explored the area. Stayed 1 night at the Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel. Day 4 & 5: Left hotel at 6ish in the morning. Drove pass Dunraven. It was an insane drive. I prayed Hail Mary the whole time. We went to Lamar Valley. Saw so many bison. They crossed the drove and walked pass our car. We checked off every stops on the map. Got to Canyon Lodge. Checked in at Canyon Lodge then had lunch there. We stayed here for 2 nights. After lunch we explored the area: Canyon of Yellowstone, Hayden Valley…. We saw more bison, black bear, elks…. Day 6 & 7: Moved to Old Faithful area. Stayed there for 2 nights. Saw Old Faithful Geyer in action 6 times. Saw Beehive Geyser in action once. Explored Upper, Lower Basin…….We saw a grizzly bear and her cub near our cabin. Day 8: Left Yellowstone via West Entrance. We took the highway this time. Got back to SLC airport. Took the late evening flight home. We love this trip so much and would want to come back after we finish the Mighty Five of Utah, Glacier NP, and Yosemite in a few year. I would want to add at least one extra night at Old Faithful. Two nights are not enough for that area. The weather was perfect. It was chilly in the morning and night but the day was comfortable.

Grand Teton,"The Tetons were absolutely gorgeous in late September, especially with the aspens turning a golden yellow in contrast to the magnificent mountain backdrop. We entered the park from the North Entrance after touring Yellowstone for a couple days, and drove the 42 Mile Scenic Loop, then stayed in Jackson Hole for the night. The two parks are very different from each other, and are spectacular each in their own way. We loved Yellowstone for the wildlife and geyser activity, but really enjoyed the spectacular scenery of the Tetons. With the parks so close together, it would be a shame to see one and not the other.While Yellowstone needs at least 2 to 3 days to experience the park properly, you can easily visit the Teton highlights in a day. We found ourselves stopping at most of the pullouts, and took way too many pictures because every stop gave you a different perspective. While we did see bison and bear here, they were at a distance. And unfortunately we did not see any moose. Lamar Valley in Yellowstone is the place to see wildlife in our opinion. The animals are right near the road in herds. The Tetons are all about scenery, scenery, scenery!The crowds were definitely less in September, but you will still run into parking issues at Jenny Lake, which is the most popular place in the park. The area was still under construction when we visited, but it doesn’t look like they are increasing the parking areas. That’s too bad, because it is sorely needed. Definitely heed everyone’s advice about getting there early. You’ll probably still have to stalk someone for a parking space like we did! The boat ride over to Hidden Falls was reasonably priced (ask for a senior discount, which is not posted on their sign), and the hike to the falls is relatively easy. There are lots of steps closer to the falls, but you can take your time and go at your own pace. The views of the falls are worth it. Expect the shuttle boat ride round trip, the hike and parking to take at least 2 hours. Also make sure you checkout the Jenny Lake Overlook pullout for some spectacular pics.Here are the other “Must See’s” in this stunning park:Schwabacher Landing is said to be one of the most photographed mountain scenes in the country. The reflection of the Tetons in the water, coupled with the yellow aspens in fall is simply breathtaking. There is only one sign on the road for the turnoff, so keep your eyes peeled or you could miss it. Once you turn off the road, be warned, it turns into a bumpy gravel road. Just go slow, and it will be worth it. Drive all the way to where the porta potty’s are, then get out and walk the trail toward the water on the left all the way to the log bench. The whole trail is about a half mile on an easy flat path, where you will see the famous upside down reflection of the mountains in the water. Fabulous!Oxbow Bend Turnout is another incredibly spectacular spot and an easy pullout off the road. It is just past Jackson Lake Junction. It was foggy the morning we were there, and the mountains were a little difficult to see, but the scenery was still outstanding.Make sure you take the Signal Mountain Turnoff and drive to the summit. It’s twisting and a little steep, but easily driven by most vehicles. RV’s are supposedly banned, but you still see them! The view at the top is worth it. Once you get to the very small parking lot, there is a short trail that is easily walked for some fantastic views. There is another viewpoint about half way up the mountain that is easily missed. There is a small sign on the left as you are driving up, but we found it since there were other cars stopped there. It is also a very pretty view.Right after the Signal Mountain Turnoff heading south is the Potholes Turnoff. As you are driving toward this turnoff, you will see the famous postcard view of the Tetons spanning across the road. It’s amazing! No one seems to mention this view, but it is one of our favorites. There are many other turnoffs to stop at, and every one of them is worth it. And as we said, you can see the highlights in a day, but you’ll want to stay longer! If you like to hike or cycle, this is a lovely area to visit for a few days. We’re glad we visited in late September. The rewards were awesome; smaller crowds and fabulous fall scenery.","October 23, 2018",Scenery is Just Fabulous!,322,"Buffalo, NY",5

Grand Teton,"We entered the Park from Yellowstone's South Entrance and stayed two nights at the wonderful Jackson Lake Lodge. In addition to the spectacular granite peaks, which rise unbidden from the plain, we visited the excellent Craig Thomas Discovery & Visitor Center, which offers great insight into local natural history. Gathered around a relief map, a knowledgeable ranger explained in which ecosystems we might see various animals. While we ultimately hoped to see moose and beaver, unfortunately, it wasn't to be. Despite that, we greatly enjoyed our visit to the Park.","October 23, 2018",Fabulous!,110,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5

Grand Teton,"My first vision of Grand Teton National Park was seeing a large moose grazing a few hundred feet from our window in the Jackson Lake Lodge. Beyond the moose was Jackson Lake and the Teton Range, highlighted by the Three Tetons, the signature attraction in the 310,000-acre park that was established in 1929. Yes, the sight of Grand Teton (13,775 feet), Middle Teton, South Teton, Mount Owen (the second highest peak in the Teton Range, 850 feet lower than Grand Teton) and Mount Moran is spectacular and awe-inspiring and picturesque. But there is so much more to Grand Teton National Park. It includes the major peaks of the 40-mile-long Teton Range as well as most of the northern sections of the valley known as Jackson Hole. The valley is 55 miles long and 6 to 13 miles wide on the east side of the Teton Range. Located 10 miles south of Yellowstone National Park in northwestern Wyoming, Grand Teton National Park is named for the tallest mountain in the Teton Range. The park has numerous lakes, including the 15-mile-long Jackson Lake, more than 1,000 drive-in campsites, over 200 miles of hiking trails, more than 1,000 species of vascular plants, dozens of species of mammals, 300 species of birds, more than a dozen fish species and a few species of reptiles and amphibians. It is noted for trout fishing, especially the Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout. It also is a popular destination for mountaineering, hiking, fishing and other forms of recreation. An average of 4,000 climbers per year make an attempt to summit Grant Teton. It is an almost pristine ecosystem and the same species of flora and fauna that has existed since prehistoric times can still be found there. Some rocks in the park have been dated at nearly 2.7 billion years. In the winter of 1807-08, a fur trapper and mountain man named John Colter, who had left Lewis & Clark's Corps of Discovery on its epic journey to the Pacific Ocean, passed through Jackson Hole and was the first Caucasian to see the Teton Range, the youngest mountain range in the Rocky Mountains. Grant Teton and its neighbors began forming between 6 and 9 million years ago. The Teton Range, the Jackson Hole valley and the town of Jackson are a vacation in themselves, a beautiful and relaxing contrast to the bustling activity and crowds of tourists that dominate more celebrated Yellowstone National Park.","October 14, 2018",It's much more than the Three Tetons,4679,"Chicago, Illinois",5

We spent 4.5 days here doing short walks and driving the loop road circuit. The Park is a thousand feet lower than Yellowstone so it makes sense to visit here first from that point of view if you are doing any physical activity. It is also good for wild life.

Grand Teton,"What a scenic drive! We were on a family trip, and decided to do a relatively easy hike. The location we picked was a bit popular and with only 50 parking spaces, we had to wait - but no complaints here, since the view was stunning, and it was nice to take a break and just enjoy being in nature.Our hike was simple, and we made sure to have bear spray with us (suggested by everyone!) - and the sights, sounds and smells were a welcome change from city life.We took our time, stopped for water, explored overlooks, had a granola bar which we shared pieces with a chipmunk when we paused to eat.We went back in a second time, with a wildlife guide, set up by the Four Seasons where we were staying.Our Guide brought us in at 3:30p and took us to areas we would have never found or known about on our own, from a map or talking to anyone else.We saw plenty of wildlife, and also chatted with others who had scopes set up looking at wildlife they had found.Most people with scopes, are very willing to let you have a peek! We saw various deer, bison, moose, elk - all were incredible, and all were in different locations around the park.We also drove through GTNP to get to Yellowstone, which was another wonderful scenic drive to and from Yellowstone.On the way there the leaves were just starting to turn, on the way back, brilliant yellows had captured the hillsides!","October 2, 2018",Views and views and more views,22,"Boston, Massachusetts",5

Grand Teton,"First off, I don't want anyone saying that I missed the point of a national park. Let it be said that Grand Teton is second only to Glacier in natural, awe-inspiring beauty. But ... a couple of ""heads up"" notes for those planning to travel to Grand Teton for the first time. One, wifi or internet access is extremely limited. Yes, I agree that you travel to the park for the natural setting and solitude. But admit it, we all have family to stay in touch with, careers that don't stop, projects that are ongoing. You will have to scout out access and maximize your productivity when available. And don't think that your cell (carrier dependent) will bail you out. Cell coverage isn't universal. Your best bet is to ask employees where they connect, and then go to that location. Finally, if you are a passport stamp collector be aware that Grand Teton has a bunch of different stamps at various locations. See all the visitor centers (warning, some only open seasonally, all close at 5:00). Not crucial obviously, but for those that keep track of such things. Besides, these are also the best places to learn about the park, get trail advice, find out about wildlife sightings, get an updated weather report, know where to get supplies and frequently enjoy displays and exhibits.","September 26, 2018","Drop dead gorgeous, but a few caveats.",155,Fort Atkinson,5

The view from these accommodations is wonderful; we watched the sun set each evening from our balcony before heading to the restaurant building for an excellent meal and more views of this exceptional mountain range. The food in both the formal and informal dining rooms was freshly prepared with good ingredients by a talented chef. We also highly recommend Signal Mountain Lodge’s Snake River float trip, led by a guide who was experienced and knowledgeable about this area.

The smaller size means that you can visit different areas of the park more easily. A short drive from one location quickly changes your views and experience.

Crowds were down in September so it was easier to maneuver the sights. I would suggest that you familiarize yourself with the map of the park before you go just so you know what you want to see and where things generally are. Another suggestion is to use the Gypsy Guide app. I read about it on TA and purchased it. It tells you information about things coming up along your path and it does not matter where you start. It will tell you if something coming up is a MUST SEE or if you can skip it if you do not have the time.

Grand Teton,"For some reason, a lot of people seem to miss out Grand Teton and drive straight past. Those who do are missing a lot. There are many trails of varying length and difficulty but you don’t need to be super fit to find some that are easily accessible and well worth a hike lasting from a couple of hours to half a day or more.One of the best is the trail round Jenny Lake. If you want to run round, and there are those that do, it may be only a couple of hours but if you want to take in the magnificent mountain views and the beautiful scenery around you then allow a half day or more. One of the most common starting points is from the Visitor Centre/Ranger Station at South Jenny Lake and then head North to the head of the lake then South along the other side. For those who feel that the walking is getting too much, there is a ferry that takes you from the West bank to the Visitor Centre cutting off part of the trail. The trail leaves Jenny Lake shore at the North end and takes you up river to a bridge going over to the West bank. For only a little more walking, you come to String Lake where local people come for the day out to swim and canoe. There are lots of places where it is really pleasant to just sit for a while and possibly have a picnic meal.Take note of the information about bears and follow it. On our trip round the lake we saw three bears at fairly close quarters with the nearest being about 20 feet. A bit of a surprise for us as it had been hidden by the undergrowth but not for the bear as, following the advice, we were making enough noise for him (or her) to hear us before we surprised it. The bear was peacefully munching through a patch of berries, had a look at us then carried on munching despite a man (not in our party) seeing the bear and running off screaming “Bear, bear, run, run for your lives!”. Not exactly the best thing to do.Construction work at the Jenny Lake Centre visitor had limited the Visitor Centre facilities, although there were lots of Porta-Potties, and parking is significantly restricted. The first day we were there it was thunder, lightning and pouring rain but it was still difficult to find a parking space. On the second day, cars were parked all along the Visitor Centre Access Road and out onto the sides of the highway. Don’t let that put you off, just get there early! As usual in a NP, the Rangers were excellent in their knowledge and we had a lengthy and interesting conversation with a patrolling group of 3 on the differences between US and Scottish National Parks. Well worth the pause in our hike.We hadn’t realised quite how much there is to see at Grand Teton and it is now on our list of repeat visits.","August 26, 2018","Don't Just Admire the Mountains From a Distance, Get in There!",104,Scotland,5

The Teton Range of magnificent mountains stretches for 40 miles, and is about 10 miles south of Yellowstone National Park. The Park was extablished in 1929, shortly before the October stock market crash. Surprisingly, even with financial collapse, conservationist John D. Rockefeller, Jr. began purchasing land in Jackson Hole (pioneer speak for Jackson Valley) to be added to the national park. Much of this eventually created Jackson Hole National Monument in 1943. The Park is name for Grand Teton, the tallest mountain in the range, abruptly rising 7,000 feet above the valley floor and topping out at 13,775 feet above sea level.","July 23, 2018",And grand it is☺,2202,"Orlando, Florida",5

While it's a national park and subject to crowds in summer, there's lots of space, places to hike, drive and spent time relaxing. Driving north from Jackson Wyoming, there's numerous miles of paved biking paths.

(Congress didn't want them but finally took them.) They are the core of Grand Teton National Park. Thank you, Rockefellers.The Teton Range, in some places more than 12,000 feet high, is so dramatic because it is not obscured by foothills. We saw it by float trip on the Snake River, its gentle stretches all but flat and ideal for floating. We saw the Total Solar Eclipse on August 21, 2017 from the parking lot at the Craig Thomas Visitor Center.

Grand Teton,"Since we were at Yellowstone we decided to also include Grand Teton Nation Park. Grand Teton is much smaller than Yellowstone and does not have as much diverse scenery, but it is still pretty spectacular. The Teton mountain range is pretty spectacular especially if you happen to catch the sunrise as the sun paints the mountains with light.Most of the activity seems to revolve around Jenny Lake. While we were there the visitors center was being re-done so the Park Rangers were set up in a temporary structure. They also had a lot full of porta potties for visitor use.Two of the most popular hikes are also currently closed. One due to renovations and the other due to the possibility that a large boulder may break off and come crashing down and cause damage and potential injury to visitors. The Park Service is not sure when that trail may reopen. Even with that closure there are still many other good hiking trails to take.Grand Teton is not as heavily visited as Yellowstone, but since it is smaller it may seem like there are just as many people.If you are in the area visiting Yellowstone you do need to spend some time at Grand Teton as well.

Grand Teton,"I have already written about numerous aspects of this park but am adding a section which pertains to all of the parks we visited in a five state area of the west. This section is my personal opinion of when to visit, as I have visited the area numerous times and at different times of the year. Without a doubt, the optimal time to visit is from late May to mid June for a variety of reasons. In the first place, traveling before mid June beats the summer season rush after the kids get out of school. Secondly, snow melt is still underway and you will enjoy snow capped vistas which will not be present in late summer. Thirdly, the snow melt turns the landscape green and lush, particularly in Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons.. In September, brown will be the dominant color.

Okay...A few miles from the Jackson Airport, from Teton Village and Jackson, Wyoming are the entrances to Grand Teton National Park. We were there in early July as the summer season advanced...your experience will vary during the time of year.The opportunities abound, from boating to fishing to hiking. We enjoyed two separate hikes: a short one to Taggart Lake and a lone one up the Cascade Canyon trail. In both cases, you are surrounded by grand landscape and the opportunity for wildlife viewing. If the outdoors are your thing, you can easily spend 3+ days here. Have your insect repellent if you are near standing water. Wear sunscreen as you are at altitude.

One trail was closed because of a bear, and there was construction at another visitor center where they are said to hang out. We didn’t see any big wildlife actually. So my advice is if they what you are going there for of course go early or later evening, I guess you need to plan to drive the whole park (we didn’t, we came from the south enterance of Yellowstone and didn’t explore much of the southern most of the park). Now if you own a boat than this has got to be a premium spot. The lake looks beautiful and it’s huge, plus Snow cap mountains in the backdrop. It was nice but wish we had planned it better.

Grand Teton,"Heron Pond Trail is an easy walking path with excellent views of the Tetons. It’s a good, short trail for all ages. Much of the path follows the shoreline and is in the shade. About 40 minutes from the trailhead you’ll come to a spot that opens up to beautiful views of Mt. Moran and its reflection in the water. Trailhead signage (Hermitage Point, Swan Lake and Heron Pond trails) and bathrooms are at the southern end of the Coulter Bay Visitor parking lot, next to the boating docks. I made a loop combining Swan Lake and Heron Pond trails. It would have been better to simply take the trail to Heron Pond and then continue on the Hermitage Trail. Unless you have extremely powerful binoculars, there’s little to see at Swan Lake other than water lilies and grass, ducks, and a beaver dam in the distance. The Swan Lake Trail travels inland mostly through forest. After an hour when Swan Lake turns slightly downhill and connects with Heron Pond, suddenly you have a Teton mountainscape in front of you. Picture time! On a clear day you’ll have gorgeous photo ops of mountains with water reflections. In mid-morning the lighting can be good for family portraits. Colorful wildflowers were along the path in early June. If you are hungry after your walk, there is a casual restaurant (The Ranch House) adjacent to the the parking lot that is open most of the day, with basic menu selections, and wine and beer to celebrate your adventures!","July 7, 2018",If short on time at least take the Heron Pond portion of trail leading to Hermitage Point,188,"Scottsdale, Arizona",4

Grand Teton,"The mountains are always a sight to see! The drive through the national park is nice but it is busy. Parking at the major sights is always full and people park along the road and where there really isn't a parking space so watch your driving. If there is something that you particularly want to do/see and it is one of the more popular sights, plan on getting there early to get a parking space. But the mountain views are awesome and well worth the effort.","July 4, 2018",Spectacular views,67,Illinois,4

Grand Teton,"The Grand Teton Park is very close to Yellowstone but completely different. Here you have real mountains with rocky peaks and wonderful canyons between them with a typical alpine ecosystem as the base formed by wonderful lakes hills and forest where typical wildlife is around (it remember me the European Alps though bears are really present at Grand Teton). In this park you can go for real alpine hikes and/or back country in the wild and the amount of people is not extreme for full day hikes, while simple hikes are quite crowded in the summer peak season. Lodging in hotel or camping might not be simple in order to find a spot, camping works with a first come first served basis which makes quite impossible to plan a vacation here in the high season.","July 2, 2018",Real mountains in a great ecosystem,20,"Ivrea, Italy",5

Grand Teton,"I immensely enjoyed my 3rd visit to this incredible and varied park. My sister and I took advantage of many of the opportunities the park offers. Our drives allowed us to see wildlife including buffalo and antelope. We spotted deer near the Jackson Lake Dam where one also gets great mountain views and reflections. More reflections can be viewed in many of the small lakes, but arrive early for best parking. Wildflowers brightened all our paths in June. We took the Jenny Lake boat and hiked to Hidden Falls. This is not to be missed. The falls and cascades are gorgeous as is the setting. While many trails provide challenging hikes, less strenuous walks for the casual hiker can be found at Taggert Lake and to Heron Pond from Coulter Bay. This is also a good location to rent a kayak or canoe the lake as is Signal Mountain Lodge. For a bit of history, Mormon Row is a great spot and quite photogenic. Several businesses provide float trips on the Snake River. We found the Solitude Float Trip quite excellent. There is so much to do here, such varied scenery to be observed and photographed, and the park is much less crowded than Yellowstone. It can be combined easily with a visit to that near-by park, but will not disappoint as a destination in itself.","July 2, 2018",Spectacular Park,188,"Long Beach, California",5

The result is a serene and beautiful park that can be driven through, photographed, hiked, boated, biked, or tackled in any way you choose.

It was another in the geology buck list visits as some of the rocks in the park are the oldest found in any U.S. National Park and have been dated at nearly 2.7 billion years.Jackson Lake fronts the majestic backdrop of the peaks, giving great picture opportunities especially early morning and evening, if you can couple this with a flat calm water surface the pictures are well …….

It was just amazing.","January 22, 2018",Breathtaking,20,"Fayetteville, Arkansas",5
Grand Teton,When I first landed at the airport all I could do was look at the Grand Teton mountains. The mountains were mostly hidden by clouds and during the winter this is pretty common. You can drive on both sides of the mountains onwards Jackson hole and then to victor. Our last day the mountains were clearly visible the entire day. It was a very special treat and a great way to end a vacation!,"January 21, 2018",Awesome views,69,"Peru, Illinois",5

Grand Teton,"If you are going to visit Yellowstone National Park in northwest Wyoming, then by all means, be sure to set aside at least a couple days to visit the grandeur of Grand Tetons National Park. Some of the most iconic and breathtakingly beautiful mountains views and vistas you will ever see !!! Just as fantastic and as awesome as all those pictures you see in the books and calendars.Here are some highlights to put on your Top 10 List (in no specific prioritized order):1. be sure and do all of the turnouts along the road that loops through the National Park...they are there for a reason, so take the time to check out the fantastic views !!2. Jackson Lake Lodge...an architectural gem, take a stroll through, have a cup of coffee of a light meal...and the views out the windows are fabulous !!!3. do a river float down the Snake River...a totally unique experience and perspective...we actually saw moose along the riverbank, and eagles !!!4. you gotta do some of the hikes, all skill levels are available, but we pretty much stayed to the easy to moderate trails, and had a great time...excellent way to see yet another perspective of the Park...some of the trail names and sites: Paintbrush Canyon Trail, Cascade Canyon Trail, Inspiration Point, Hidden Falls5. Jenny Lake and Jackson Lake...beautiful lakes you will see them as you drive along the loop road, and you can even take a shuttle boat across Jenny Lake when you want to go hike the Cascade Canyon Trail.Plan on at least 2 days...but that really is not enough time...really should be 3 days to do the Park justice...heck, you could spend a week there, if you were really big into hiking !!!Stay down in the town of Jackson...do not confuse this with Jackson Hole (that is just a ski resort development). The town of Jackson is really cool, great restaurants, eclectic shops and galleries...sure it's a bit touristy, but if you go in the off-season, you won't get that.I would recommend visiting Grand Tetons National Park in the off season...we went in mid September...the crowds were virtually non-existent, really nice...everybody disappears after Labor Day weekend...and the temperatures start to cool off nicely as well.Grand Tetons is really a super beautiful national park...put it on your list to visit, you will be glad you did !!!","January 11, 2018",Grand Tetons National Park - is a Must See !!!,186,,5

Phelps Lake hike by the Lawrence S. Rockefeller institute is about6 1/2 - 7 miles, pretty flat, and not heavily trafficked. Inspiration Point - take side trail past the point for great views and to leave some of the crowds.","January 9, 2018",Spectacular hiking and moose watching,60,Santa Fe,5
Grand Teton,"Now that I have written a review for Grand Teton National Park, I assume this one is about the Grand Teton Peaks. So, whether you are on the Idaho or the Wyoming side, this mountain offers two beautiful sides. The national park is on the Wyoming side and offers a completely different view than the resort Idaho side. I recommend seeing both sides if you get a chance. There are many turn off point to admire these peaks, but to truly sink it in, you need to stay a while and enjoy the many features surround this magnificent place. The best part is, you can enjoy this mountain any time of the year, whether you are on the lakes below, or skiing through its slopes in some of the best powder. Believe me, it does not disappoint!","January 4, 2018",Beautiful Anytime of Year,792,Wyoming,5

It is not as crowded and smaller, however, the mountains view, the river and lake, offer some of the greatest scenery I have ever seen.

Grand Teton,"Going to the Tetons in September seemed like the perfect idea. A float down the Snake river was in order! The weather changed our plans as it rained and then snowed! It was the second week of September! We were so disappointed not to share that river trip! Feeling like this vacation was ‘on the ropes’, I went to the visitors center at Colter Bay and met a native artist named DG House! After a wonderful tour of her incredible art, did I mention her famous blue bears? We had a delightful conversation! She said how lucky we were to see the Tetons in the snow! Most visitors to the park never see the park that way! I felt suddenly so fortunate! She was so right! The next day we went on a very cold exhilarating boat ride across Jackson Lake to the foot of the Grand Teton. We were told again how only a small % of visitors to see the mountains this up close and personal! The snow made our visit so memorable. Also the animals are easier to see! Next time we will go in October! ","December 27, 2017",We saw ithe park in the snow,7,"Wayne, Pennsylvania",5

Grand Teton,Unfortunately the tourist season was still going strong. Parking was an issue even in mid September. First stop was the Jenny Lake visitor center. People were parking anywhere and everywhere but we were fortunate in that we found a place. Walked through the visitor center and received appropriate information on the trails. Initially wanted to walk from visitor centers to string lake but changed our minds and decided to walk to Jenny Lake overlook. Path signage did not seem up to the standards of a national park. Several times the map and the signage did not agree but the scenery was terrific.,"December 7, 2017",Mountain Majesty,41,"Springfield, Missouri",4
Grand Teton,"This is a beautiful national park. You probably wonder: why did she only award 3 stars? First, we made the mistake of visiting Yellowstone NP first and then Grand Teton; and compared to Yellowstone, everything else can just loose. Also, we stayed here in October and you can do a lot less here at this time of year than in the summer, that was our second mistake. In addition, my husband is so afraid of encounters with bears that we did not make a major hike, which would have been nice. And, last but not least, we visited Mount Rainier National Park in the summer and the only advantage of the Grand Teton compared to Mount Rainier was that the lakes are really beautiful right in front of the glaciers.The nearby cowboy town of Jackson is a good place to stay and have a good dinner.","December 6, 2017",Nice,190,"Karlsruhe, Germany",3
Grand Teton,"It was so wonderful to see and experience the Grand Teton Mountains and the Grand Teton National Park.

Grand Teton,"Fabulous views of the Teton mountains from largely flat plain below provides unobstructed and sweeping views upwards of 7,000 vertical feet. These mountains and those next to Salt Lake (Wasatch) are only major ranges in US where there are zero foothills due to nature of the fault lines along the mountains, providing jaw dropping scenery instead of obstructed views. Combine with the wildlife and it makes for fantastic trips. Have traveled every 1-2 years here for 30 years. NEVER tire of it! Town of Jackson also has real western boardwalks to enhance the cowboy feelings. Plenty of activities too (e.g., hike, bike, fish, boat, raft, whitewater raft, tram, etc.). And then there's Yellowstone so close. It used to be quiet, but now folks know. Too many know.

The air is fresh, the park is clean (but can be crowded) and the park is loaded with wildlife, but you have to watch closely for it. It's not a zoo! Don't approach the animals that you do see, but enjoy them from a safe distance.

The wife busied herself taking photos outside and I spend some time looking at the information and exhibits. We then drove further into the park.

These are the two pictures of the national park that stick most prominently in my mind.Although time is of the essence for us, time seemed to stand still at the Grand Tetons.

We entered from the South, via Jackson Hole and its a really nice drive following the Snake River. Once in the park, there are plenty of turnouts where you can park and either enjoy the stunning views of the Tetons across Jenny lake, or take any of the hikes which are clearly marked and range from short and easy to quite challenging. There's als a big visitor centre with lots of information and helpful rangers. As you head North you'll go past the reservoir and dam up towards the Rockefeller area and all the way the views are just wonderful.","October 2, 2017",Stunning views,482,"Sevenoaks, United Kingdom",4
Grand Teton,"We visited Yellowstone National Park several years ago but there was so much to do and see we never made it down to the Tetons. Don't make that mistake. It was not until this year that we took our son's advice to making GTNP our sole destination and we are so glad we did. The amazing thing about the Tetons is the way they seem to spring up from the Jackson Valley floor - you won't find many other mountain ranges that are as dramatic as this. The views alone are worth the visit, but the history of how this area was settled and made into a national park are just as important. Here area a few tips about our stay in GTNP (I've posted many more on the individual sites, places to stay, etc. on TripAdvisor so keep looking if you want more info.) As older camper-hikers we did not attempt any of the long or even medium hikes in this park. But the ones we chose were excellent. Here’s a run down of things you shouldn’t miss in GTNP if you aren’t up to anything strenuous in the backcountry. First of all - the Visitor’s Centers - not only do they orient you with maps and brochures, they also have rangers and volunteers who can answer questions (like do I really need bear spray? - Yes you do!) and great gift shops which benefit the park, unlike the shops at the lodges. But there are also restaurants and gift shops at the Jackson Lake Lodge area and the Signal Mountain Lake Lodge area. If you are looking for groceries you can’t go wrong with the general store at the Coulter Bay area. The GTNP 42-mile loop road is well worth traveling, even if you don’t do the entire loop - there are amazing stops along the way to both view and hike. If you’re interested in swimming, you can do so in any of the park’s lakes, but one of the best places to go is to the boat launch near the Signal Mountain campground. The cobbled beach is long and the water is clear and cold. A fifth activity that is very doable even if you are not physically strong is the one-mile-in and one-mile-out hike along String Lake to the south end of Leigh Lake. Some other stops you might want to make are the Oxbow Bend turnout on the loop road or the Snake River above Jackson Lake Dam. Catholic Mass is celebrated at Chapel of the Sacred Heart near Signal Mountain campground. and Episcopal services are held at the Chapel of the Transfiguration. A drive up Signal Mountain road is twisting and steep (about 6 miles long) and parking is at a premium at the top, but panoramic view can be had from the top parking lot while a short walk from the next-to-the-top parking lot takes you to a view of Mount Moran and the Snake River. The best view of iconic Mount Moran can be seen from the Signal Mountain picnic area, campground and boat launch-beach - you can stop over even if you're not staying in the campground or the lodge.","October 2, 2017",Yellowstone's lesser known cousin but so much more!!,416,"North Carolina Mountains, North Carolina",5
Grand Teton,"We've seen gorgeous pictures of this place and our kids have been here and said it's worth seeing, so of course we were looking forward to seeing this final scenic ""hurrah"" on our way home from a huge five week cross-country trip.As we crossed Wyoming, coming from the Black Hills of South Dakota, it was sunny. In fact it was sunny until we got here. Then it started to rain.If you know the ""claim to fame"" for this place, then you know it's the scenery. So, trying to see huge mountains through a rainstorm is a bit depressing. But, we thought we would make the best of it since there really was no choice. We even got to see an elk grazing a few yards from the road, along with a bunch of other people. I'm not sure which was more fun, seeing the elk, or watching people trying to get pictures of their kids with an elk in the background.Ironically, the rain ended when we left Jackson, a tourist town nearby! But we got a few pictures, and there were less people than there would otherwise have been.The best way to see the park is by taking Teton Park Road. It's not marked well. From Moran, the south entrance, you will skirt the Snake River on your left first. The first main road you see on your left is Teton Park Road. You will know it's the right road because shortly after going on it, you will go over the Jackson Lake Dam, where the Snake River comes out of Jackson Lake. If you need them, there are some primitive rest rooms on the right just past the dam. There is also a large visitors center not much further south near Jenny Lake.From the north,Teton Park Road is just past Jackson Lake Lodge. It will be on your right.","October 1, 2017",Surprise!

The river was beautiful, Jackson Lake was gorgeous! We did not see animals as we were there when it was overcast and too cold. I highly suggest the Plains and Panorama loop that last 1.5 hours, but you see a LOT! Pick up a map and follow the loop. Highlight for me was the Chapel of the Transfiguration located at the Jackson end of the loop. Very spiritual and beautiful frame of the Grand Tetons at the pulpit. Ate at Sheffields Restaurant at John D Rockefeller Memorial Parkway at Flagg Ranch. They had the best food we ate our entire week trip. They close at 2:30 for a break before reopening at dinner.

They extend to about 12,000 feet and are really something to see. Along the way they have different water falls and different beautiful rivers to enjoy seeing. We stopped at a place called Jenny Lake and were able to go on the Float Boats due to having a beautiful day out. The Float Boats are large rafts that hold up to 10 to 12 people. We enter the boat at waters edge and once everyone is in we start heading down the Snake River. Our Tour Guide NATE was Outstanding. He was the only one who paddled the boat and it takes a lot of strength to maneuver a boat of that size with that many people in it, but he did such a terrific job. Along the way he would tell us about the river and point our any birds or animals who happened to appear, there were several and they were beautiful. About 1/2 hour into the trip he gave everyone lunch bags which contained a sandwich (we had to let our Tour Director Barb know the day before our choice of sandwich) it also contained a bag of chips, a cookie an apple and a bottle of water. That turned out to be a very delicious lunch and we couldn't eat it all so we just saved the rest for another time. The ride lasted about 2 hours but didn't seem that long, it went by so fast.

The only thing I knew about Grand Teton National Park was that is showed up as a green area on my road atlas.Immediately north of Jackson, the snow capped mountain range was visible to the west. We were mesmerized by spectacular jagged peaks, which were intermittently visible for forty miles, as cloud formations drifted over the tops. We stopped at a dozen roadside turnouts to read the park's educational posters about native American history of the area, the wildlife, and the flora that flourishes in higher elevations. In mid-September we encountered sleet, hail, snow, and gorgeous sunshine all within a matter of an hour. The Moran entrance gate was closed by the time we arrived just after 5:30, so there was no one collecting admission fees. Entry is free after the booths close. We have senior national park passes, so we never pay anyway, but visitors who just want to drive through might like to save the $30 entrance fee.","September 24, 2017",Spectacular Vistas Driving Hwy 191,1006,Florida,5

Grand Teton,"It's hard to believe that the iconic Teton Range is only 40 miles long, but it is such a marvel from every angle that perhaps even a mile more would be overwhelming. Whether viewed from the Snake River or from far eastern Idaho on the ""quiet side,"" they beckon, these natural cathedrals, year-round. The roads, trails, lakes, and waterways are a continuous treat, camping and other recreation sites ample, wildflowers abundant when in season. The land sings with the timeless tracks of the elk, the bear, the Shoshone, the mountain men . . . and women. The wind remembers thousands of years of seasons harsh and lush, impossibly deep snows, dense and lively forests, and shimmering meadows, revised from time-to-time by towering fires. Hollywood came calling in relatively recent times and left with classics like Shane, but you will make your own stories here, in living color, and you will never forget them.","September 18, 2017",Be Dazzled!,125,"Boston, Massachusetts",5

On a trail at Colter Bay towards Swan Lake we got great pictures of a great gray owl. The hiking trail was super beautiful. The trail from String Lake to Hidden Falls has an osprey nest.

Grand Teton,"If you have a disability, this review is for you. If you fly by the seat of your pants, this review is for you. First, you fly by folks. If you plan on camping in Grand Teton and want a good spot. Get there early, as in before 11. If not, you'll be hanging out at the big spots. And while they're still gorgeous they might not be up your alley. It's also much less busy. Much. The lines and pockets of frustrated people get much larger after noon. As far as camping here with a disability, it is amazing. I'm a fly by the seat of my pants traveler and ended up at Colter Bay Campground. Not where I wanted, but that was completely my own fault. It however was gorgeous, tons of spots for those of us who run on our own clock and if you have a disability, they have very accessible toilets in the campgrounds themselves and shower facilities next to the general store. Make sure you ask if you'll be in an area with generators. If you want quiet, you don't want the area with generators. The sites are well kept and clean. There are amazing accessible and off road trails in the Grand Teton for everyone. Do your research if you're looking for accessible trails. Jenny Lake Trail is fantastic, but there are tons more. If you're up for something more challenging search out the rangers and their wealth of knowledge about their park. Wouldn't hesitate to come here again and am already planning my trip for next year. Also, if you don't like a smoky national park, come earlier in the year. August and September are historically wildfire prone times of the year for the area.","September 17, 2017","Camping in Grand Teton, if you have a disability, this ones for you!",37,"Columbus, Ohio",5

Unfortunately, the mountains were obscured by smoke from the western wildfires, great for sunset photos not so great for day time shots.Things we'd suggest you do (in the most fun order) are:1. A wild life tour with the Teton Science School2. hike to Hidden Falls. Take the boat across Jenny Lake (10 min., $15 per person) and it's a 2 mile hike to the falls which are great.3. drive the Rockefeller highway and stop at the various pullouts . We saw a moose at Willow Flats4. Stop at all the pull outs off of Route 26/89. We saw moose on two consecutive days at the Blacktail Ponds overlook.5. stop at the visitor center in Moose, WY6. visit Colter Bay and the VC thereWe drove the Moose-Wilson road and did not think it was worth doing, no moose lots of cars.","September 15, 2017","Great mountains, lots of wildlife",258,"Hurricane, Utah",4

This is my first ever post! If the feedback if positive, I will continue posting on this trip.Wednesday-9/6: We flew American from Louisville, Ky to SLC, arriving around 1:00. From previous postings, we knew we needed to not waste anytime if we were to make it to Jackson Lake Lodge before dark. We had carry on luggage only and a quick rental pick up at Enterprise. We only stopped one time, which was in Idaho Falls. We picked up groceries and a cooler at Albertson's, stopped at the liquid store next door, grabbed some fast food and hit the road as soon as we could. The trip from SLC was interesting and there were quite a few areas of construction, but no hold ups along the way. Starting at Victor we were able to use the Just Ahead audio app, which we enjoyed. Just outside of Moose, we had our first widlife sighting. A mother mule deer and her fawn jumped in the road in front of us. We also spotted 2 male mule deer nearby. On the road between Jackson and JLL, we saw a sign that said ""Bison on Road"", and sure enough a large, solitary bull was in the field next to the road. The rest of the trip to JLL passed uneventfully and we arrived at the lodge at 8:00. Sunset was at 7:56 so just in time. We had a lodge cottage with 2 double beds. We were happy with the room and enjoy the setting, including the 2 chairs on the front porch. The wi-if worked great and coffee was provided.

This trip was really great, and the mountains, activity and wildlife did not disappoint. Truly stunning scenes.... we hiked from Lupine Meadows to Garnett Canyon and stayed overnight, climbed and then hiked out. We saw bears (young cubs - so momma bear was most likely close by - make sure you bring your Bear Spray along!), deer, elk and all kinds of critters. The weather turned out to be spectacular and everything worked well for 3 days in the park. Even if you are not the hiking/camping/climbing type, I highly recommend getting out into the wooded areas and going on some type of day hike just to experience the beauty of nature there. It truly is beautiful, and the views from higher up are outstanding as well. Make sure you have plenty of water and snacks to keep you going. Also, as crazy as it seems, cell phone reception was pretty decent where we were at, so we were able to keep in touch with all things worldly as well.Simply a beautiful, relaxing area to visit - but more tourists there then I've ever seen before so plan accordingly!","August 16, 2017",Stunning Mountains and wildlife,100,"Bountiful, Utah",5

We have been to this park before but chose to spend 4 days here as part of our summer road trip. I could easily spend a whole week here but time did not allow this trip. We stayed in both Colter Bay cabins and Jackson Lake Lodge. I preferred the more laid back feeling of the Colter Bay Cabins. There is hiking, water activities, horseback riding, and just relaxing watching the sunrises and sunsets. Gas, food, and lodging are all available within the park.

I can not help but compare with numerous spectacular sights.We took pictures of the Grand Teton at almost every viewing pullout. One of those have wildflowers.Our brief stop at the Marina was fine. Visitors rented kayaks or went for boat rides. At Jenny Lake, there are not many good choices. Most are cold pre-prepared sandwiches. They do have ramen soup and a microwave but with a wait to use it.The grounds have construction; hence, my memory of it is not pretty and neat.We found the shuttle ride to the Hidden Falls. It is a five-minute ride o.w. for $15 r.t. After docking, it was a nice hike with good photo opportunities. There were mountain climbers on two parts of the rocky mountains, which was awesome to look at through binoculars.Beyond the head of the falls after the 2nd or 3rd wooden bridge along the trail is a steep climb that gives visitors a view of Jenny Lake and the shuttle coming or going.The wait for the boat did not take long.From Jenny Lake, we purposely drove south to Moose and drove the loop where there is pullout directly in front of the Grand Teton, a lovely spot to take pictures.On the way back north, we saw a fourth bison herd that was not as close and not very far from the loop.","July 29, 2017",Majestic mountains,143,"New York City, New York",4

The roads for cycling are wonderful - even the jumpy ones like Mormon Road - and the lakes!!! Beautiful beaches abound along String and Leigh Lakes with just a short hike. We SUPed on String Lake at sunrise, relaxed on Leigh lake during the day and also biked a few trails. Beautiful scenery no matter where you are in the park. The bull elk at sunrise!! Oh my, stunning. Get up early and go for a drive (5:30am or so) to see these magnificent creatures. Proximity to Yellowstone is nice especially if you want to get away from the massive crowds.

I found the park staff to not be as sharp or friendly as those in Yellowstone, which I only made note of after such a positive experience with the park staff at Yellowstone.

Grand Teton,"I have made it a practice to review the hotel that was the final destination of each day's journey to begin each portion of this narrative. This entry is an exception due to my beginning this tale with a review of the Paintbrush Hotel due to our pleasant experience with them while Tripadvisor reviews were largely responsible for our choice of the hotel.This was the first day we had to implement a Plan B (Grand Teton NP) having heretofore faithfully followed the itinerary I had mapped out up to this point although our ultimate destination, Riverton, Wy., remained. We left earlier than usual due to the weather (very cold, windy, snow and sleet, 32 degrees; precip lessened as we headed to Jackson Hole but was off and on most of the day) and the uncertainty of an improvised path. The road from Rexburg to Jackson Hole (JH) was full of interesting sights including the ruins of an earthen dam on the Teton River in 1976, just a few miles upstream of Rexburg. The collapse of this dam took out about 80% of the town we just left! Wow! Many other interpretative overlooks were visited as we traveled east on Idaho 33, crossed over the mountains (w/ occasional light snow) arriving in JH where we found a Visitors Center which proved quite helpful going into GTNP.GTNP well worth the visit. Check the web. Not crowded at all with anything but wildlife and magnificent views. Overcast hid the peaks but the mountains are sublime. Met an entire family of Red Sox fans. Once again, cordiality all around. Spent a good 4 hours mostly driving, pulling out/parking, reading signs, short hikes (it was cold) and gazing at the mountains. Leaving GTNP E to Riverton is a straight shot through the center of the Wind River Reservation. We started E in brief, sometimes heavy snow but soon found sunshine and temps in the 50's. For miles we had the road to ourselves on a scenic drive, towns few and far between. I do not recall the speed limit (65 to 70?) but I believe we made it to Riverton in a ""timely"" manner. This was not the first time the road was almost as enjoyable as our time in the park, nor the last.Next time: Riverton to Provo with another visit from Mother Nature....""the best laid plans....""","July 22, 2017",5/17/17 Rexburg to Riverton via Jackson Hole and the Grand Tetons.......,38,"Saint Louis, Missouri",4
Grand Teton,This is my favorite place to visit and I try to get here once a year. Just know the summer months are the most crowded and if you don't like crowds wait until the end of August to visit. I have been in July and August. I prefer August because I don't like the large crowds. Plus I have seen more wildlife in August when driving around. This was a beautiful visit as always. I came early in the morning to beat some of the crowds. Laurence Rockefeller preserve was nice but the center doesn't open until 9. We were too early to go inside. This is also a major trail head location and the parking lot fills by 9 or shortly thereafter. Next stop was the Jenny Lake loop. String Lake parking lot was full and this was around 8 am. You could find parking in the larger lot down the way. We got down to the overlook and there was plenty of parking. Next stop Signal Mountain Lodge. Walked around and took pictures. We decided to go out the Moran exit. Stopped at a few turnouts for pictures. We did see buffalo in the far distance in this area. We saw no other wildlife (bummer). Early morning and evening are the best times to find wildlife but they do show up during the day as well. The mountains are majestic and you can get wonderful pictures any where in the park.

Whatever it is, these are some of my favorite mountains in the world. These come in close second to the Alps in Europe for me. I never dreamed I'd be so impressed with these. I haven't been here since I was a child and have spent much more time in other mountain ranges, mostly the Alps, so I was very happily surprised with the Grand Tetons. We flew into Jackson Hole, so seeing them from the air was an incredible beginning. My children and European friends also get a big kick out of the name.

Grand Teton,"Located between Yellowstone National Park and Jackson Hole WY, they are a spectacular mountain range. There is not as much wildlife and scenery as Yellowstone, but it is worth a visit if you are in the area. Take a float trip or a hike. There is a car trail for those who need to see the sights without walking. Go to Jackson Hole Teton village to catch a gondola ride to the top of a mountain. I highly recommend staying in a lodge. We stayed at Jackson Lake Lodge and although they are 50/ style motel drive-ups, they are totally renovated and comfortable. (Remember there are no TV or refrigerators in national park hotels). They are drive-up and handicap accessible. There are 3 dining options in the main lodge and an awesome outside bar with a view of the mountains.

I thought that would be hard to do, but yes, I did enjoy it more. Although in fairness, it's like comparing apples and oranges.The scenery is magnificent, but everyone knows that. We bought numerous books on hiking beforehand, but I think that was overkill. Save your money because you can find plenty of information at the park. If possible, go on a ranger led hike or talk. We did a couple of these, and both were incredibly informative. I especially enjoyed the caravan in the the evening looking for wildlife. The park is very busy and can be crowded.

He showed me photos of his family atop Signal Mountain which instantly changed my mind. Being so near at Yellowstone, I'm so glad we went, I have amazing photos and memories.We took a day trip from Yellowstone to the Tetons. Taking the South Entrance out of Yellowstone brings you into Grand Teton NP. We stopped at the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway visitor center for maps and the rangers were extremely helpful in helping us plan our day. We had hoped to hike up Signal Mountain, but the 3 hour one way hike was too long for our short day trip...so we drove up there! Bring a picnic lunch and some chairs and have lunch atop Signal Mountain. You will love it. There is a pull off enroute to the top. Stop there and get some great photos and mountain air. We saw animals in the valley below and a bear nearby.After Signal Mountain, we went to Jenny Lake and hiked to Moose Pond(s). It was a moderate hike that goes off the beaten path. We missed the Moose others reported seeing, but saw a huge buck as we were exiting the trail where it connects to the parking lot. We were literally within 10 feet of this amazing creature as he slowly walked past us, across the path, and into the woods on the other side of the path.I wish we had more than 1 day to be in the Tetons, they are so amazing to experience!","July 17, 2017",Near and deer,48,"Chicago, Illinois",5

It's very important to research your trip in advance, so you know what exactly to spend your time on depending on what you like to do. Everything can be researched online.Mountain viewing? The Tetons stretch for almost 100 miles north-south. There are incredible views from every angle, and specific mountains are more prominent at every viewing area. Check out a virtual map in advance so you recognize the peaks.Hiking? Trail maps available from the FS/NPS. Hikes from 2 hrs to 4 days. If you are coming in winter you can snowshoe some of the shorter hikes close to the southern entrance.Fishing? You need a WY fishing license, but there is no NP license required.Swimming? Don't miss the String Lakes.Lunch/snacks/dinner? Dornan's is loved by locals as well as touristi. Moose often visible there. Less expensive than Jackson Lake Lodge, Lodging? All lodging in GTNP is limited, including camping of all kinds. You must have reservations, preferably a year in advance. Fanciest--Jackson Lake Lodge, but also more touristy. A very nice lunch visit on the deck. A little less fancy & a bit more rustic, Jenny Lake Lodge, where there are also cabins. Otherwise camp or stay in Jackson.Floating/Fishing the Snake River? You must have a guided trip for this, unless you are a very experienced whitewater rafter. Even then, year-to-year conditions can make a huge and violent difference. We have already lost 3 people on the Snake this summer, a real tragedy. (We have our own raft and haven't been out this year ourselves because of the conditions.)

Grand Teton,"During my stay near West Yellowstone I was determined to see a Moose in the wild so I set off from my accommodation for a three hour drive through Yellowstone and into Teton to get to the observations points before sunrise.Seeing the Teton mountains in front of me as I drove out of Yellowstone was one of the most breathtaking sights I have ever seen. Words can't describe the view and I should have stopped to take some pictures. However, I drove on into the park and took some from a longer distance as the sun was rising. The view was still spectacular but not as good as the view from close up.I eventually drove towards Moose Wilson Road, which is a narrow road off the beaten track. I arrived there about 6.45am and drove the whole length of it hoping for success. I spotted to Elk stags near the far end of the road as it approached the other side of the park towards Teton Village.I drove into Jackson, filled up the tank and drove back the way I came. Shortly after returning to the park I observed about half a dozen Moose but they were so far off I could only see them through binoculars. However, I persisted and eventually struck lucky as I saw a mother and calf sitting by the river bank. My dreams came true and that truly made my holiday. I stayed sitting on the bank observing them for about an hour before deciding to return to my accommodation. On the way back I drove past the town of Moose and over the Teton pass, which takes you up a snaking road through the far end of the mountains. This was a lovely drive towards Driggs and well worth the effort. Overall, this was the best day of the holiday for me and I still had another week to go.In summary, anyone expressing a wish to go to Yellowstone, ought to visit Teton as well. There is wildlife a plant and a better chance of seeing Elk, Moose and Grizzly Bears.

I would recommend this park to anyone who appreciates fantastic scenery.","July 7, 2017",Can't beat the views.,102,"Scottsdale, Arizona",4

It is purely amazing to see the mountain range cut into the blue sky, specially for its tallest peak, the Grand Teton. I've seen many mountain ranges and this already beat the Remarkables in Queenstown, NZ as my favorite.The drive as you enter Grand Teton National Park is I think the best way to marvel at how grand it is.

Grand Teton,"Loved the Gran Tetons better than Yellowstone. First. they are less crowded. You can find some off-the-beaten-track trails and easy to hike areas. You can drive this park without sitting in traffic. (It took us nearly two hours to leave Yellowstone because of the traffic!) The views are majestic and thrilling and inspiring whereas Yellowstone has fewer vistas (more lake hiking and geyser viewing (which--and I know how this sounds--is like technicolor hot tubs that smell of a burnt match/raw egg and are several rows deep with tourists if you get there when they're about to ""go off""). There were moose, antelopes, deer, prairie dogs and river otters.

Grand Teton,"My wife and I recently visited Grand Teton, Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks. In terms of most spectacular views, I have to put Grand Teton at the top of the list. From your very first view of the mountains you will be continually saying ""Wow"" around every corner. The Park offers lots of options, whether you are just driving around, hiking or camping. We visited in early June, so it was not crowded at all. If you do visit during peak months and want to get away from the crowds, try Phelps Lake, which limits hikers to 50 cars (just go early). We stayed at the Jackson Lake Lodge (which was excellent), but there are lots of other options. This is a must see if you are traveling anywhere nearby.","June 18, 2017",One of the World's Most Beautiful Places,42,"Fishkill, New York",5

Hard to say which one is better - Yellowstone gets the marquee billing as it was the first national park. . . but Teton gives it a run for the money in terms of sheer beauty. The landscapes are breathtaking, the hikes are phenomenal/oh so numerous to choose from and the photo opps are at every turn. If you go to Yellowstone, don't miss Teton!!!","June 17, 2017",SO BEAUTIFUL!!!,9,,5

Our tour guide George found out our interests and then did everything he could to make sure we saw everything on our list. The only thing we did not get to spot was a grizzly bear. But with wildlife there are no guarantees. George has immense knowledge of the area and the wildlife that call it home. We were so excited to see all that we could he agreed to keep driving and we had our dinner when we arrived back at our condo. When we got out of the van we were all on an incredible high and could not stop talking about the experience.

The scenic drive along Teton Park Road is fantastic and make sure you stop at many of the scenic stops around Jenny lake, Dam spillway and of course Moose where you get some great views of the Grant Teton Mountains. Loved this park and would highly recommend spending say 3 - 4 hours enjoying all the sites.This would have to be one of the more scenic parks in America by far","June 10, 2017",Better than Yellowstone,257,"Sydney, Australia",5

Grand Teton,"Driving to the park was very scenic and approaching the Grand Teton was majestic but misleading. It's not just another mountain. After we entered the park, we drove to Jenny Lake. The approach to Jenny Lake was like out of a magical story - evergreens dappled in snow hanging to create a canopy over the road. Then the lake appears - beautiful, pristine, crisp, serene - with the mountain overlooking and a gentle breeze. Picture perfect! Loved it! One of my favorites!","June 10, 2017",Majestic!,17,"Peoria, Arizona",5
Grand Teton,"We had such a lovely time in the Tetons, the scenery was absolutely spectacular! I enjoyed the scenery here so much more than Yellowstone. It was right up there with Rocky Mountain National Park if not topping it. We hiked the NE section of the Jenny Lake trail and also Leigh Lake. The park is quite easy to navigate and it wasn't terribly crowded. We especially enjoyed Jenny Lake and Leigh Lake. Some overlooks that I recommend are the following: Blacktail ponds, Schwabacher landing, Oxbow bend, Cascade Canyon, Jenny Lake overlook, and the dam near signal mountain. Of course, you have to drive along Mormon row. I was not as impressed by Gros Ventre road. Signal Mountain and Part of the Jenny Lake trail were closed.I thought we would leave the Tetons without seeing any major wildlife, but as we were about to leave the park, we passed by a bear jam. It was a thrill to have a close up view of a grizzly and her two baby cubs! We stopped and I stood outside viewing them for about thirty minutes. The rangers did a great job of keeping everybody safe. For heavens sake, wear proper footwear here. All of the people walking down steep, rocky embankments in sandals were making me a nervous wreck. If you don't have hiking boots, at least wear good sneakers. We packed summer sausage, plain mustard, cheese, crackers, peanut butter, granola, dried fruit, and whole wheat tortillas so that we didn't need to eat out much in the park. Don't make the Tetons a quick day tour from Yellowstone. I preferred the Tetons and recommend spending at least 1.5-2 days here so that you have time to do some hiking.","June 10, 2017",Outstanding scenery!,35,"Malibu, California",5
Grand Teton,"Every positive review is true about the beauty of this place. The scenery is amazing and the hiking very good, but the parking lots were full at many of the trailheads, forcing people to park on the road or in the grass, wherever they could squeeze in. We were blocked in at one point when someone jammed their small car behind us. The park really should consider a shuttle service like Grand Canyon. Would make this park much more enjoyable not having to worry about parking. Definitely visit but bring your patience.","June 10, 2017","Beautiful park, but crowded",27,"Plano, Tx",5

Grand Teton,"Visiting it after Yellowstone, as many people do. It is much smaller, and you can drive around the whole park in an afternoon. We drove through it on the way to Jackson in the evening and saw one half of the scenic loop drive. The next morning we drove back up and around the whole loop. The scenery is breath taking and unusual. There are also lakes and wildlife, in addition to snow topped mountains, covered with trees. There are many hikes and trails and bike routes for those so inclined. Many people seemed to park, and then go for a bike ride. Don't miss it. It is as good as Yellowstone, but different!","June 9, 2017",Outstanding and very relaxing scenery!,34,"New York City, New York",5
Grand Teton,"We spent a few days enjoying Yellowstone, then came down to the Tetons. We thought nothing would top Yellowstone for scenery, but we were wrong.

However, you can enjoy the mountains anytime during the day.","June 8, 2017",Wow!,78,"Huntersville, North Carolina",5

Grand Teton,"This is one of our two favorite National parks (the other is Rocky Mountain Park). It is even more picturesque and awe inspiring than Yosemite. The variety includes mountains, bush covered plateau-rangeland, the Snake River (awesome with the spring runoff), and Jackson Lake. There are lots of animals for viewing, especially buffalo herds. Lodging in the park tends to be expensive and overbooked, but good places can be found in nearby Jackson and Teton Village ski area. We just enjoyed at stay at Spring Valley Ranch.","June 8, 2017",Absolutely stunning,63,"Seal Beach, California",5
Grand Teton,"The first word says it all! We have been here several times over the past 30 years, but this is the first opportunity to comment about it. We camped at the Signal Mountain Campground for 4 nights. Despite some lingering snow banks, and a late spring snow storm, everything was about perfect. Our camp spot was near a CLEAN toilet and water spigot, and we were within easy walking distance of hot showers, Jackson Lake, and the SM Lodge and store area.We did several hikes near Jenny Lake and Jackson Lake Lodge. We also rode the nice paved bike trail round trip between Jenny Lake and Moose (we would have ridden to Jackson Hole, but we got started too late in the day). Except for our first day with snow which blocked the view of the Tetons, every morning and evening view was spectacular.We wanted to launch our kayak, but the water was still tooo cold for us. And the higher flow was more than we backwater paddlers wanted to manage; there were many others who did take commercial rafts down the Snake River.The wildlife was wonderful - bear cubs and moose calfs. Plus lots of birds, deer, and elk.We plan to return again.","June 7, 2017",GRAND!!,29,"Eugene, Oregon",5
Grand Teton,"We stayed in West Yellowstone, and took a day to visit Grand Teton NP. The mountains are beautiful! The Teton's reflecting in the waters of Jenny Lake are breath taking. We checked the weather forecast before we went, to pick the best day to go. We passed through there again 3 days later on our way home, and it was snowing. There were so many clouds, you would never know there were these huge mountains so close to us. The last few times we've been to Moose Junction, we have actually seen a moose!","June 6, 2017",Spectacular!,28,Escondido,5

Grand Teton,"We had heard that the Cascade Canyon hike was very popular but not too difficult. Given that we were there in mid may, which is just prior to the beginning of the busy season, we thought we would try it. We read that you could hike a couple miles to the trailhead from the south side parking lot, or ride the ferry across the lake. Unfortunately, both the ferry and trail to get to trailhead were not open. We stopped in at the rangers station near the parking lot and a very experienced ranger recommended driving up the road to the north side of the lake and approaching it from that end. We did that and experienced a beautiful hike along the west side of the lake. We saw marmots and osprey and a few stumps that looked like bears. I did an informal poll of the hikers and about 50% were carrying bear spray. Finally, we got to the end of the trail that had a turn off to inspiration point. It wasn't clearly marked and much of it was snow covered within the trees. There weren't many people at that point, and without bear spray we felt we should turn back. In the summer it will be fine. On the way back a marmot confronted us on the trail but scurried off. ","June 4, 2017",Jenny Lake hike,20,"Houston, Texas",5
Grand Teton,"This National Park is absolute stunning. Within 60 minutes of the South Gate to Yellowstone, do not bypass this park. Rarely does a National Park give you the iconic image from every place in the park. The Teton vistas are present throughout. We unfortunately only had two days so we hired the excellent company, Eco Tours, to tour the park and look for wildlife. The Tetons are known for their wildlife viewing versus Yellowstone which is more geologically based (hot springs, waterfalls, etc). We also did a float trip with ""Solitude"" down the Snake River which allowed for more stunning Teton views. We did have time for one hike on Jenny Lake which I highly recommend.

Grand Teton,"During a winter the park is covered by snow and looks as infinite white plateau. The cross country skiing option is immense. Naturally the place is designated for the cross country, with the trail which was supposed to be groomed.In the fact, the trail was totally ruined by high-school youngsters which decided to walk on it. The path to Jenny lake takes about 4.5 miles X2, a good workout for the non-experienced and endless scene of the white all around and forests and foggy mountains on the back plane. So definitely worth it!Fee entry was 10$. Can get only by car. Parking was free and abundant.","March 1, 2017",The view is breathtaking. The ski trail was less impressive.,26,"Haifa, Israel",4

Grand Teton,"The beauty is breathtaking and the trails are an amazing hike. To start off, the mountains are breathtaking and everything about the park is beautiful. I’m from Ohio so I hadn’t seen nature like this before. I went with my family to go hiking after we heard so many good things from the hikers at Glacier National Park and family friends. Even after it was described to us, we still were not prepared for the park. I only went for a week but I feel that I was barely able to hike at all, and take in much of the park. Another amazing thing about the par is the wildlife. Grand Tetons National Park has an amazing diversity of life. For example, when I was hiking one of the trails towards the end of my trip, my mother and father split off from my brother and I, but we ended up seeing a grizzly bear. Another example was on the first day, we were hiking around the lake up to the mountains because we didn’t want to take the ferry, and we got to see a mother moose and her cubs. The Tetons are an amazing view, regardless of where you are. The previous year my family and I went to Yellowstone and Glacier National Park, and we heard that we should visit the Tetons. So the next year, we rented a cabin at a KOA near Jackson Hole WY, and drove into the town. Jackson Hole is a nice small town, that is about as active during the snowy season as it is during the summer. During the day, my family would travel to different spots in the park or beautiful lodges. Overall, the Tetons are a wonderful, beautiful place and if you’re in the area, they’re definitely worth visiting.","February 9, 2017",An Excellent View All Around,5,,5
Grand Teton,"I have visited the Grand Teton National Park in the winter and in the summer... so, this review will not cover Spring and Fall. Winter. The park is beautiful but can be inaccessible. The road to Yellowstone is shutdown. The snow can be very deep and you will need appropriate equipment to negotiate any trails or off-road paths. That said, there are many beautiful views to enjoy.Summer. I took my Harley up to Grand Tetons and then rode through Yellowstone. Excellent ride. Incredible views. Worth the road trip!","February 4, 2017",Stunning beauty...,25,"The Hague, The Netherlands",5

I was disappointed that such a wonderful national park eluded my list of travel destinations for so long.I believe that Yellowstone takes many would be visitors from this destination, and it overshadows this wonderful gem. I would recommend this park to anyone who is visiting the area to see Yellowstone. Try to set aside a few days to explore and camp in this area. There are more ""civilized"" accommodations available too for those who don't enjoy being immersed in the great outdoors as well!There are a lot of great hikes, and the weather is pretty decent for late spring through autumn. If you are a nature lover, this is a great spot to go to. I saw brown bears, black bears, elk, mule deer, a moose, and more! Do yourself a favor and check out this underrated gem.

Grand Teton,"Yellowstone Park was beautiful and fun but maybe because we are from Oregon, the terrain was actually not something we don't see often in our own state. Of course, the geysers were a one-of-a-kind sight to behold and that alone was worth the trip. But the Tetons made me feel like we were in Switzerland or something. Just such majestic mountains. SO glad we came south to see them!

Grand Teton,"If you love nature and natural trails, head to Grand Teton National Park. Get there early! Parking can get difficult so get there early to get a spot in the parking lot or you will be parking along the sides of the road and walking. We started with walking around Jenny Lake to get to Inspiration Point. It was a moderate hike but nothing too terrible. It has some beautiful spots to stop and take pictures. Unless you are an experienced hiker, plan on taking the boat back when you get to Inspiration Point. Inspiration Point is completely worth the trek it takes to get there. It is moderate and uphill, not for those scared of heights as there are some places where you walk close to the edge. There are two beautiful places to stop and rest on the way up, and it is quite a ways up, more than we thought originally, but completely worth it. A MUST see!Taggert Lake and Bradley Lake are also beautiful hike. Taggert is a relatively easy hike and a perfect place to spread out and eat lunch. Bradley Lake is 1.4 miles from Taggert Lake. I think it is more beautiful than Taggert, its is not a hard hike. However, there isn't a sign when you get to Bradley Lake. When you get to the sign for 2.1 miles back to Taggert Parking, continue a little father and you will get to a beautiful opening to Bradley Lake, it is a perfect spot to dip in your feet in.

Grand Teton,"The night sky slowly fades into the soft colors of the early dawn. Bleary-eyed and tired we cross over and into the city limits of Jackson Hole Wyoming; we stop at the first open gas station to fill up, stretch and get coffee. There is a slight comfortable chill in the air, it feels refreshing and after a few sips I get my second wind, with a sublime enthusiasm we continue on. Jackson’s Hole as it was originally named is a town established by fur trappers in the early 1800”s, nestled between mountain ranges it offers endless amounts of outdoor adventure, summer and winter, however it’s the ski season that echoes the popularity of this once quaint cowboy town with its photographic backdrop. As we drive through the streets waiting only on traffic lights the sky begins to brighten allowing full view of restaurants, art galleries, and high-end shops. We slowly browse while driving and quickly arrive at the outskirts of town to our next stop Yellowstone National Park.  This mere stretch of road that cover the gap between Jackson Hole Wyoming and Yellowstone National Park is one of the most breathtaking and memorable drives that can be experienced. Plan ahead, It’s best to start early at first sunlight and miss the summer caravans of traffic. The loneliness of the road is calming and thought provoking and with some luck deer and elk can be spotted so stay alert.  As the morning light brightens, there on the horizon, rises one of the most wondrous sites scenic views to gaze upon; The Tetons, the most majestic and jagged mountain ranges in the western part of the United States. From afar the light gently cascades upon them illuminating their snow-capped peaks with shades of pinks, oranges and purples. Speechless and envious, I feel small and humble as we gaze upon their grandeur.

After one morning where it rained so hard you could see the raindrops, the afternoon produced lots of clouds with blue sky and a temperature of 17 degrees C.

Two days was no where near enough time to really enjoy what this park has to offer.We spent a fair amount of time talking to the Rangers to find the best day hikes in the park. The Rangers are so knowledgeable! Be sure to speak to them if you have never been to the park before. There is a fee to get in the park. I believe it was $30 per car. But really, just by the National Park pass. It gets you in all the parks for free for a year and is only $80. Even though we were only day hiking, we took day packs with water, snacks and emergency supplies (because you can't be too prepared). Some of the day hikes are challenging. So you will be happy to have that extra water and snacks.There are lots of great places to pull off and park. Make sure you have a map since some roads are one way or loop back.

We stopped at most of the overlooks and Mormon Row and exited out the South part to Jackson WY. It is a place you could spend a lot or a little time enjoying. A half day was fine for us. We saw a lot of Elk and some antelope. I enjoyed seeing Mormon Row in particular. October was a good time of year to go-pretty trees, animal activity, not crowded.

A bull elk and his ""harem"" entertained us royally one early morning. His bugling was a real treat! We also saw moose near Gros Ventre and lots of pronghorns and bald eagles along the banks of the Snake River. Don't miss doing a rafting trip down the Snake River! It was wonderful, and our guide was extremely informative. I recommend the pulled-pork sandwich at Signal Mountain Lodge. Also, have lunch at the fancy restaurant at Jackson Lodge. The views are magnificent and the food is excellent! For hiking, do the loop around Jenny Lake and don't be afraid to venture off the trail and down to the pebble beaches on the lake.

Grand Teton,"What I liked best about Grand Teton is that they had lots of biking and hiking trails. It seems very bike friendly. While we didn't give ourselves enough time to drive the entire loop, what we saw was stupendous. We drove from Island Park, ID through the scenic bi-way and could see the mountains of Grand Teton almost the entire time. We will definitely return to Grand Teton to see everything we missed and even repeat some of what we did see.","October 9, 2016",Absolutely beautiful.,164,"Abington, Pennsylvania",5

Grand Teton,"I expected Grand Teton National Park to be impressive but I couldn't have prepared myself for just what we experienced. In many years of travelling across the US it was simply one of the absolute highlights. I had never been so captivated by so many views - the Tetons themselves, from the Snake River pull outs to Signal Mountain, to Jenny Lake, Lake Jackson. Simply everywhere had a world class view.The visitor centre was really pretty and a great place to get the background before setting off. We had purchased an annual national parks pass last year which was still valid, A fabulous way of saving money and show your support. We will certainly return we were so taken with this national park. It really needs a couple of days to do it justice and to see the views at different times of day. The sight of an aircraft seemingly gliding effortlessly down into Jackson airport through the morning mist with the Tetons in the background made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. Worth a very early start that morning to see the view at that time. We also found the park to be teeming with wildlife - we actually saw far more variety here than at Yellowstone.I can't wait to come back :)","October 7, 2016",No words can do the Tetons justice,580,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",5

We saw lots of wildlife during our afternoon drive around the park; Elk, Antelope, and Buffalo.

The farther south we travelled, the more spectacular the views were, until we got to Jackson. I would't waste any time on Jackson itself, but GTNP has many, many places to view the mountains, hike, and bike. Fortunately, we had two and a half days to spend wandering around. We stayed at Colter Bay, which was centrally located. Next time, I'd choose a dude ranch in the valley just for the experience.","October 1, 2016",Truly Beautiful,12,"Lansdale, Pennsylvania",5

While driving, don’t expect to go get too far too fast. If your map app says you will be somewhere in 30 minutes, plan on 45. Some people stop to look at any animal – even a standard horse. There are many pull-offs to stop and enjoy the scenery.

I cannot believe that I have never been here before -it revitalizes one and gives one a perspective of how magnificent nature actually is. I think that this time of year is particularly beautiful with the changing of the leaves with the wonderful cloud formations and the incredible skies. Everyone we met was so friendly and when they said hello, it was a really genuine hello. I understand why people love Wyoming so much. It is a very special place!!!!!If you can, I would recommend stopping at the Jackson Lake Lodge for lunch or just a stop. They have a lobby with 60 foot windows that look out to the golden fields with the mountains in the background.

To truly enjoy this park one cannot just drive through it you have to get off the beaten path, but that is difficult to do in just a day or two. We enjoyed some side roads not just the north south route like Mormon Row where we saw settlers cabins and barns and the much photographed Moulton Barn with the backdrop of the Tetons. We were lucky to photograph a Black Bear enjoying berries, a small group of Pronghorn antelope, Bison, Mountain Bluebirds and an Osprey fishing. Jackson and Jenny Lakes are beautiful and we enjoyed a picnic on the shore of Jenny Lake all the while marveling at the beauty surrounding us and we were visited by several Gray Jays. Although the Berry Fire between Grand Teton and Yellowstone was in progress we had clear, beautiful skies during our visit. A photographer's dream.

Grand Teton,There's a main strip that runs north and south along the range. Take that up and back and you've pretty much seen the Grand Tetons. It's a row of mountains. There are a lot of turnouts that allow you to view the mountains at different angles and some include lakes and a river. Good picture opportunities but once you see them from the main road then you won't see anything that surpasses that. Worth a visit but I'd keep it to a day at the most. ,"September 9, 2016",Beautiful but gets old,33,"O'Fallon, Missouri",3

For those wanting to shorten their hike, you can take a boat across the lake or take the boat back to the parking area. $9.00 each way.2. Went to the Laurence Rockefeller Preserve and really loved hiking to Phelps lake. Saw a beautiful baby bar climbing a tree on the way in, from the car. 3.Enjoyed hiking to Taggart Lake and also Bradley. Moderate elevation. Very beautiful views.

We visited an abandoned Mormon village whist travelling through which was very interesting and I would recommend. If you are travelling between Yellowstone and Salt Lake City in a day I don't think I would recommend going through Grand Teton NP as it added a lot of time onto the journey and we didn't have much time to stop at the view points, which just lead to disappointment.","August 31, 2016",Wish we could have had a longer visit,4,"Carlisle, United Kingdom",4

That was well worth doing and you can walk pretty much as far as you like. The second day we drove along Hwy 191 and explored the scenic turnouts. We tried to get into the car park for the Laurance Rockefeller centre as we also wanted to do a hike from there but there was a queue.

Our daughter and boyfriend enjoyed hiking trails in the canyons looking for wildlife. They were thrilled to discover two male moose resting in the shade along a stream in mid-afternoon. The ferry ride across Jenny Lake was a beautiful ride. We booked a raft float trip down the Snake River which was a highlight of our western vacation.

We took a float trip on the Snake River and booked a Fly Fishing trip. We were not disappointed but delighted everywhere we rode the horses, floated down the river, and the wildlife we viewed.

Grand Teton,"Spent 2 full days hiking and driving around the Grand Tetons. Wish we could have spent more time there. We took the boat across Jenny Lake and hiked up to Inspiration Point and out to Cascade Canyon. It was gorgeous and not a very hard hike, even for 2 out-of-shape city slickers like me and my husband. We hiked part of the way around Leigh Lake, eating lunch at a quiet spot and hiked around Taggart Lake. That was a little creepy because someone had startled a bear in that area and people were afraid to run into that particular bear. That day we ended up hiking 15 miles. We hadn't planned on hiking that much, but, we were enjoying ourselves so much we didn't notice. That day my husband got 3 different love letter emails from his Fitbit for all the hiking we did! A different day we did the 42 mile scenic loop around the Grand Tetons. It was beautiful and very enjoyable. We saw the ""Mormon Row"", a must if you like taking pictures and stopped at the Jackson Lodge which was very busy with a lot of people, but, had a magnificent view of Jackson Lake and the mountains. We drove up to Signal Mountain and spotted a small bear cub walking on the side of the road. It was around sunset time. All the people desperate to see wildlife- anything! in Yellowstone should drive an hour south and check out the Grand Tetons. Away from all the visitors, that is the better spot for wildlife viewing, methinks. We also stopped at a lookout to the Snake River. The view was breathtaking and when I turned around, I noticed that a fawn was watching us from a short distance. When I go to the dentist or have to endure something I find uncomfortable, I try to envision a beautiful place that I have been to. Now that I have visited the Grand Tetons, I have new footage to work with. Love this place. Just go. And go back as often as you can. ","July 31, 2016",So gorgeous,122,"Miami Beach, Florida",5

Grand Teton,Grand Teton National Park is one of the true joys of this country. The mountains are unique in that they are relatively young and rise with no foothills with the Grand Teton rising to 13770 feet. The light changes during the day and every phase reveals more of the beauty of the mountains. Be sure to see them after sunset and when the stars are out. The mountains in a full moon are glorious.

The locals were very friendly and welcoming...also met staff from around the globe. Other vacationers were from all over the US and beyond. The three nights /4 datpys at the park were as full as we wanted them to be. The Jackson lake lodge rooms consisted of a large number of 1 story buildings with nice cabin style rooms. The rooms were large, updated bathrooms all walking distance to the main lodge but a van was available. We went on an enjoyable scenic raft float. The lodge had a few restaurants from very informal to more expensive. There are a few shops on the upper floor of the lodge. The view from the real of the lodge is just amazing. You look out over a huge meadow that may have wildlife with the river just beyond and the Tetons just beyond the river. There's also a couple of easy hikes right from the lodge grounds. The activities desk and staff - ask for Carl- were also very helpful. There's a coral on premises. The little dye location is also good. I could go on but I think u get the idea.

Grand Teton,"An amazing place you will remember always. Be sure to explore Jenny Lake (either hike around the lake or take the boat across). Hike up to Inspiration Point, and then on through Cascade Canyon. Continue on to Lake Solitude - this will be a 15 mile round trip hike - but it is worth it. Allow a full day so you can take your time. This is the most amazing hike I've ever taken. During June Lake Solitude is still frozen. Take a good camera and bear spray and know how to use both. Take plenty of water - for three of us, we packed 5 liters of water and ran out on our return. We came within 100 feet of a moose, and had several close encounters with smaller animals such as marmots. Other recommendations: whitewater raft down the Snake River; see the Rodeo in Jackson Monday or Wednesday evenings (I recommend reserving seats ahead of time vs. general admission); take the drive up to Signal Mountain for a great view and a picnic; visit the Church of the Transfiguration; explore Jackson Lake and Lodge; drive along Hwy 191 in early morning or evening for a chance to view wildlife - we saw a huge herd of Bison crossing the highway one evening.

We saw moose, bison, elk, and some other animals. Its kind of like hunting, you need to keep your eyes peeled to spot the animals. They are really not that close. They give you binoculars. Its was a good trip though. Btw, there is a $15 charge per person to get into the park, which is not included. And the trip is a solid 4+ hours.

At the end they got sworn in and were given badges or patches which ended up being a great way for kids to start talking to other kids who had earned their badges.

The condo was perfect (3 bedroom, 3 bathrooms) and next to a very nice heated outdoor pool and hot tubs. We would have liked to have taken a ride up the mountain on the gondola in the village, but unfortunately didn't have time. We had a couple of meals in the village, found the standard ok but could be improved as soup etc. wasn't served hot and we found the choice of restaurants rather limited. We loved travelling in to Jackson Hole however and exploring the town, museums, riding in the stagecoach etc. there.

The next morning, we stop by Antelope Flat Rd and Mormon Row which was perfect spot for photo shot of the Teton mountains, then hiked Heritage Point trail near Colter Bay Village. We loved the trail, easy walk with beatiful view of the lake, pond, reflection of the mountains and woods.","July 4, 2016",Beautiful place,32,"Houston, Texas",5

Grand Teton,"My wife and I visited after some days in Yellowstone. Yellowstone is fantastic, but Teton is just spectacular. The awe inspiting mountains dominate the sky. There is abundant wildlife, but the roads not as confining as Yellowstone. I would recommend the Jackson Lake dinner cruise - where the guides are very informative and the dinner on Elk Island is actually surprisingly excellent and almost worth the trip to the island! We also took a Snake River raft cruise where you lazily float down the river with a very informative guide and it is just apart from civilization - although my wife's cell phone rang in the middle of the cruise! There are many trails you can hike or small dirt roads you can drive down where you can be completely alone - just bring bear spray to be safe. The town of Jackson is just a short drive away and is also worth a visit. I definitely plan to return. More than I expected.","July 4, 2016",Breathtaking and inspiring!

Be sure to drive the Teton Grand Loop, and stop any place you like. The scenery is beautiful any where you go. There are plenty of vehicle pull over spots, and plenty of primitive restrooms along the way. Be sure to take a cooler for drinks and food as you may be too far away from a food source. Take time to stop at the Jenny Lake Overlook or hike around the lake for at least a little distance. You can also take a boat across Jenny Lake for a scenic ride. We also drove to the top of Signal Mountain for breath taking views. A stop at Jackson Lake will also give you more beautiful photos and a chance to soak in the beauty. All of the sights are well marked, and you can spend as much time in this park as you want. Just slow down and enjoy it. You won't have the huge crowds that you have in Yellowstone, but it is always good to get out early for good photo light and to increase your chances of seeing wildlife.","June 30, 2016",Majestic!!!

Parking at most visitor centers were easy enough except for the Jenny Lake area, there is a lot of construction going on. I would say their best visitor center was Craig Thomas and Discovery Center. If you want to catch any view points from the eastern most road, try to drive it earlier in the day when the sun gits the mountains or the barn along Mormon row, or else you'll get silluattes if too late in the day.","June 30, 2016",one day trip,30,"Seattle, Washington",4

The ride that brings you within view of this mountain range after leaving Yellowstone is amazing in itself. The various elevations you pass through give you a unsurpassed view of these scenic wonders. The Grand Tetons offer a completely different perspective of mountain scenery than when we were in Yellowstone.A ride through some of the mountains or a scenic ride down the Snake river within the mountain range offers breathtaking views with unsurpassed scenery.

There's so much to do, regardless of your vacation budget. We highly recommend doing a float down the Snake River if you have more money, and if not, there are many different trails you can hike. One thing I enjoyed greatly was touring the Bill Menor cabin and ferry - the ferry wasn't operating yet when we were there, but the lady in the cabin/shop was knowledgeable and very friendly. Many nice things you can buy and it helps support the park. I love history, so seeing things and pictures from back 100+ years ago was very cool.

Grand Teton,"Grand Teton National Park scores pretty high in the beauty scale. It has grand mountains, crystal clear lakes and prairie lands. Some of the roads around Moose,Wyoming are only open in the summer with good reason- we thought our mini-van may fall apart on the rocks and bumps. They had a sign up that they were going to be fixing the roads and that road closures were coming. If you are looking for a moose, Grand Teton is the place. We were told by a ranger that years ago during a wildfire in Yellowstone - the moose all migrated to the Grand Tetons and never returned North. We were lucky enough to see a bull on those back bumpy roads near Moose, WY. The Jenny Lake Visitor Center is under construction - it was very crowded while we were there. If you are looking to rent a boat on any of the lakes - there is a 2 hours minimum for all boats including kayaks. Kayak rental is about $22 and hour.

Many just drive through on their way to Yellowstone. It's worth a few days. Why?: One, Yellowstone is crowded. GTNP is much less so. Two, the alpine hikes like Cascade Canyon are unmatched. Three, the views. It's worth the time to see the mountains from near, far, from the water (kayak the Oxbow) and from north and south. Four, lots more moose.

Grand Teton,"Grant Teton National Park is breathtaking. The mountains are magnificent, the lakes beautiful, the forests gorgeous and overall, this park has something for everyone.I've been coming here for about 10 years, mostly in the late spring or early fall, either before the crowds arrive or after they've left. In early and mid June, the wild flowers are blooming on the open meadows with Balsam Arrowroot, Lupine, Indian paintbrush just a few that cover the hillsides and open areas. In September, we watch the daily progression from green to brilliant yellow of the aspens as they turn hillsides into gorgeous yellows and orange pictures. Of course, the animals are so special. We see bison, elk, moose, pronghorn antelope as well as bald eagles, osprey, while pelicans, herons, and many smaller birds. In the fall, it's often easier to encounter the bears, although this spring we saw a mother black bear with three cubs. Fortunately, we were far enough away that while she clearly knew we were there from our loud off-key singing, she made no effort to charge us. She did tree her cubs for awhile, but then took them further down the mountainside. We always carry bear spray.I love to hike and this year a group of friends of varying fitness enjoyed the lovely hike around Two Ocean Lake. Three of us climbed up the Grand View which was definitely worth it, but for the two that didn't go, that was a wise decision. It was a very steep climb. Another group of us hiked past Bradley Lake to the junction of the trail from Lupine Meadow. It was a moderate hike with a few strenuous stretches, but wonderful scenery. And the wildflowers were so beautiful.We also visited the Laurence Rockefeller Preserve, which has a lovely pavilion, serene meditation room and library with a history of the Rockefellers in the area. There are also several hikes that people of almost any fitness level can take that end at Phelps Lake.

We visited the park twice from our hotel in Jackson Hole. I recommend taking the Wilson Rd to the park entrance which is narrow and only partially paved. Drive slow and watch for moose & bear. Get to Jenny Lake early or after 4PM to avoid the crowds. The trail around the lake, leaving Ranger station turn right and follow the trail signs, in 1/2 mile take some of the side trails to the lake edge and enjoy the beauty and tranquility.

We were in and out of the park for several more days later in the week as we drove to Yellowstone. Got to see a mama grizzly and her cub on one of the trips and had to stop for an elk that crossed the road in front of us. It's another national park we can cross off our list.,"June 8, 2016",Spectacular!,69,"Wallace, North Carolina",5
Grand Teton," My husband had visited the Grand Tetons about 14 yrs. ago. We got married almost 2 yrs. ago & he has continued to tell me we've GOT to go to the Tetons. So, we took my parents & my sister's family for a week. In all my world travels, this ties with Alaska as my favorite! The blue skies, majestic Tetons, Leigh Lake, Jenny Lake, the bison, and great places to eat just can't be beat. The wildlife is incredible... loved having to stop the car for bison to cross the road. We also saw elk, pronghorns, a fox, and a huge Great Grey owl (the largest owl in North America). My sister & her family also saw several black bears & a moose with her calf.  The raft ride down the Snake River with Baker-Ewing was great. Our guide, Reed, was so knowledgeable & informative.  Even if you're not a big outdoors person, the Grand Tetons National Park has so much to offer! ","June 7, 2016",Favorite Place Ever!!!!,18,"Seaside, Florida",5
Grand Teton,"Driving toward the park, we came up over a hill and BOOM. There they were. We had to pull off the road and just look. Grand Teton is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. There's much to do in the park. We took the boat trip across Jenny Lake and hiked around the falls for about two hours. The views from Inspiration Point are like nothing else on earth. The boat ride is only 10 minutes or so, but it was a great way to see more of the area. Other things we saw: the General Store, Chapel of the Transfiguration, Mormon Row. Loved all of it!

Grand Teton,"We were looking for peaceful walks, views, birds, animals, flowers and butterflies. It is all there. People float from Jackson Lake Dam through a nature area in kayaks, rafts, even standup paddle boards. On walks and even from the car we saw moose, elk, deer, antelope buffalo, bear, hawks heron. The views of the Tetons are surreal.","June 7, 2016","Better than Yellowstone, and less people to boot",11,"Concord, California",5
Grand Teton,"I love the Grand Tetons! They are so majestic and beautiful, such a peaceful place! Filled with s variety of wildlife and incredible trials to explore! There is so much to see there and Jackson is not that far away. I go here at least 2 times per year! Lots of bear, moose, buffalo , elk, badgers, beavers etc. we have seen it all there! ","June 7, 2016",The most beautiful place,35,"Syracuse, Utah",5
Grand Teton,It is hard to describe such beauty. A relatively short ride through the Tetons but such an exceptional ride. It is mostly flat so you can concentrate on the beauty of not only the mountains but the water and land. Our ride ended in Moose and then on to Jackson. A small sanctuary built in 1937 was noted along the way. A nice place to reflect. ,"June 6, 2016",Splendor ,50,"Wake Forest, North Carolina",5
Grand Teton,"We left Yellowstone NP after several days and drove the ten miles up to Jackson Hole. During the summer months, Jackson Hole is not much to look at - all the real action is during the winter months when it's ski season. We drove inside the park and found all forms of wildlife there - just like at Yellowstone. While the wildlife was terrific - the mountain views were simply spectacular!! The mountains are majestic against a summer blue sky. The peaks still had plenty of snow on them. The drive was quiet and peaceful. There is a seven (7) mile stretch of roadway in the park I encourage everyone to drive - and bring your camera..the good one! Your lenses will be able to pick up all the colors and the slightest details in the landscape.If you are doing the Yellowstone/Grand Teton/Glacier NP tour line, as we did, make sure you take a good, long look at GTNP! You will NOT be disappointed!","June 5, 2016",Incredible mountain views and vistas,28,"Fairfax County, Virginia",5

Grand Teton,"Little did I know how stunning this Park is. It's wide open for driving and soaking up the vistas. The Jackson Hole airport is essentially IN the park, so start looking around and turning out at the overlooks immediately. The most attractive route north is to the west of the main road and you need to take a left to get to it soon after leaving the airport. All of the scenic roads are worthwhile for different views of the mountains and grassy meadows.","June 2, 2016",A spectacular gem,17,"Johannesburg, South Africa",5

We got into Jackson late afternoon, grabbed a picnic, fried chicken from Albertsons cheap and works for something hot and quick along with other quick items and headed to park. We grabbed a picnic table and ate and the spent evening driving and looking at animals. Going in evening has less traffic and we see so much more.

Grand Teton,"My wife and I have spent the past week hiking in these beautiful mountains and have loved every minute. Most trailsvare not for someone who does not hike but can be done if you use your head. Be prepared with bear repellant, good hiking shoes, layer you dress ( temps drop as you get higher). If you don't mind cold wx hiking these mountains are great up to June. It is May here and temps range from 32-57 degrees with some snow at night. July is the time for warm wx hiking. Either way, you won't be disappointed. ","May 26, 2016",Beautiful mountains ,8,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5

I myself made that mistake two summers ago by visiting Yellowstone and skipping Grand Teton. I quickly corrected that error the following summer.Grand Teton is magnificent!

Grand Teton,"In the past, we flew into Jackson Hole's Airport & as the plane got closer to those mountains, it just became surreal! Those mountains..they're just so IN YOUR FACE & in a good way! This time we didnt fly in Jaxson Hole Airport, but nevertheless, we drove that long stretch of road out of Jaxson Hole & did as everyone did...try to keep our eyes on the road all the while gawking at the those beautiful mountains. In any season, at any time of day, they're just breath-taking. You eventually come along a stretch whereas the buffalo are hanging out...& hey..if you have the great misfortune to have someone with you on this trip that wants to get close to a buffalo for a great shot or selfie or wants to pet a buffalo or just get near one of them..please have them look at youtube to see the outcome of others who had that same brilliant idea. Don't be fooled by their docile appearance. They're totally unpredictable. And when you're out there in the wild, you're on your own. However, the Tetons are the star of the park..& the buffalo, beautiful as they are too in their own prehistoric way, are, imho, the co-stars. They all play a part in making Grand Teton National Park one of our nations top parks you might want to put on your list to visit.","May 23, 2016",In any season..those Tetons are breath-taking!,63,"Miami, Florida",5
Grand Teton,"OK some folk will disagree but I loved this view more than any at Yellowstone. It is far lesser known but so intensely beautiful. I wish we had allowed ourselves more than 2 days to see it all. Be aware, the mountains create their own weather system & things can change in the blink of an eye. We sailed across Jenny Lake in glorious sun & retuned an hour later in a snow storm! All part of the fun.

Grand Teton,"I didn't know about Teton until I planned our trip for Yellowstone. What a shocker. When we went to Yellowstone it was busy, cool temperature, and rainy. The pools were so steamy (too cold <15°c>) you couldn't see the prismatic brilliance. Teton however; was astounding. There was beautiful sheets of rain over the mountains, enormous billowing clouds, water all over for incredible reflections of the mountains. Personally I would rather spend a cloudy muggy stay in rainy day here, over a hot sunshine day. It just added to the beauty. Even though we saw Yellowstone on a cold day (hard to see pools); Teton was by far my favourite. Take the time to explore it, instead of rushing into Yellowstone.

Grand Teton,"We visited Grand Teton immediately after being at Yellowstone so we had already experienced magnificent scenery. We thought of Grand Tetons as the ""smaller brother"" of Yellowstone but it certainly delivers on stunning scenery especially the massive Jackson Lake, Colter Bay and the magnificent Teton mountains. Don't miss out on this National Park ","May 13, 2016",Jaw-dropping scenery,319,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",5
Grand Teton,"Grand Teton National Park is one of the smaller parks in the park system, but it is one of the most recognizable in the world. Checking in at about 480 square miles it is a little larger than Rocky Mountain National Park (415), but tiny compared to its neighbor, Yellowstone (3,462). What makes Teton such an attractive destination is the amazing scenery that is so accessible. And Wyoming has done an excellent job creating an infrastructure around the park that is cowboy rustic with the availability of all the luxury any one could possibly want. I can safely say that you can go into any restaurant wearing just about anything you want and fit right in. You are accepted for who you are and how you like to enjoy yourself. Sure, there are limits, good taste and common sense, but I think you know what I mean. There is no “Gentlemen must wear a jacket” nonsense. It is casual and relaxed throughout Jackson Hole. So don’t worry about that. I say this because there are some tremendous places to dine in Jackson Hole and the scenery outside the dining room is unlike anything, anywhere else in the world. So, Teton offers everything from slogging through wetlands looking for moose, hanging off rock faces from ropes or your fingers, crashing through rapids, floating through forests, hiking trails, riding horses, flying in helicopters and eating anywhere from a smoky campfire by a lake to 5 star, seven course cuisine in an historic lodge. You name it, you can probably do it. The trick to doing the Tetons right is to learn everything you can about the place, identify what you want to do, learn about that, and then book early. Grand Teton National Park is suffering the same influx of tourists as everywhere else. Cheap gas and an improving economy has more people than ever exploring the national parks. Not quite loving them to death, but certainly making their presence known. So with all the vacationers out there, you want to plan and book way ahead so you don’t have any panic attacks while you are in such a beautiful place. Lodging options are varied. There are many choices to explore including Jenny Lake Lodge ($$$$$$), Jackson Lake Lodge ($$$$$) Signal Mountain ($$$$) and Colter Bay ($$$). There are several camping and RV options within the park too. Outside the park there are hundreds of options from the obscenely expensive to downright economical. My choice, Colter Bay Cabins inside the park on the shores of Jackson Lake. I will say it again, BOOK YOUR LODGING EARLY. One more time: “BOOK EARLY!!!” Dining is another aspect of the trip that you may need to address in advance. If you want to do the fine dining in the Mural Room or Jenny Lake Lodge, book early. Get that out of the way. You will be disappointed if you try to book the day of. Most of the other dining options in Colter Bay and Signal Mountain and even Jackson Lake Lodge are less of a challenge. And check out the chuck wagon breakfasts and dinners where you ride a horse to your dining location or take a boat to a secluded island. Start at the activity desk. There’s even a chuck wagon barbeque at Dornans in Moose as well as a rockin’ pizza joint. So, what is there to do in Teton? If you are at one of the fine lodges, it’s not bad just hanging out in the great rooms relaxing or sitting out on the patio and watch Mother Nature strut her stuff in front of you. Activities are unlimited and you can go to any recreation activity desk and book things to do. All the lodges have brochure stands and you can book your own, or the lodges have their own guides and you can book with the guide. There is hiking that takes you to amazing OMG locations. Some of the hikes involve a ferry ride across Jenny Lake to the trail head. Any hike you take is surrounded by beautiful mountain peaks thrusting up out of the earth as well as dense forests on the lower mountain sides and the beautiful lakes and meadows left over from the glaciers of the last ice age. All you need is a desire to see nature up close and personal and a sturdy pair of footwear. Oh, and carry a can of bear spray. Bears know what the red can means and when they see it, they will usually go the other way. If you get tired or don’t want to walk. Ride a bicycle. Or go for a horseback ride. The float trips are amazing. Some floats are a few hours, others take all day with a picnic in the middle. If you don’t want to float, take a whitewater trip through class 5 rapids. Nasty canyons are nearby. Name your rafting preference, you can find it in Jackson Hole. Teton is also a driving park. You can drive the roads and stop at the dozens and dozens of pullouts to marvel at the scenery. You can drive to the top of Signal Mountain for a panoramic view of the valley. See if you can figure out where Ansel Adams parked his wagon when he took his photo from the Snake River Overlook. You can drive down to the trail that takes you to the beaver ponds at Schwabacher Landing and watch the otters during the day and the beaver at night. You can drive all the roads in the park in less than a day. Don’t forget to drive out the road to Gros Ventre. It is a beautiful valley that is not in the park. There are moose, elk, deer and bison. Well worth the time and miles to see it. Teton is a small park with a big backcountry. If you like expedition hiking, then this is the place for you. You will need to plan early so you can get all your permits and campsites ahead of time, then you strike off into the backcountry for a wilderness adventure. The back country is filled with world class climbing. If you want to try it, there are mountain schools and guides that will take you out and show you the ropes. You will be at altitude and climbing is strenuous, so make sure you are fit for what you want to try. If you are going to go it alone, check the climbing ranch for preparation and permits. If you are a photographer then you are in heaven when you get to Teton. Shoot RAW files as well as JPG. If you don’t know what RAW is, one day you will and you will thank me. The picture taking starts a couple of hours before sunrise and continues well into the night after the sun goes down. There are so many iconic places to take the National Geographic shot that I can’t name them all. If you want to be shown, sign up for a photo expedition with a guide and you will see things most people don’t. Or, you can get out and explore the park and find your own favorite locations. The park has an abundance of fauna and flora. The meadows explode with wild flowers during the spring. Hiking up mountain trails you see flowers all summer long next to the streams and pools. There is a huge variety of trees, so autumn is especially beautiful (Check out the historic barns on Mormon Row in late Septmeber). And the furry animals will be plentiful including bear, deer, elk, moose, bison, coyotes, wolves, ground squirrels, chipmunks and marmots. And there are dozens of birds including owls, hawks, golden and bald eagles, magpies, jays, etc. If you like standing around, getting wet and teasing fish, then the lakes, pools, rivers and streams will not disappoint. You can study up on where you want to go or hire a fishing guide. Lures and flies are standard stuff. Lots of people fish below Jackson Lake Dam (because there are a lot of fish there) but get out and explore the other rivers. If you get a good catch, the chef at your lodge will probably cook them for you. Just ask. One day in Teton is not enough. It will just make your realize that you needed more time and will have to come back. I would say two full days is the minimum stay as a survey vacation with some activities (meaning you will come back). And you could stay a week and never get bored. Remember, it is all in the planning. I know that lots of people are concerned about connectivity. Cell service in the park is fairly good, but can get spotty up on the hill. All the lodges have wifi in the great rooms, but probably not in the bed room. So if you need to stay connected, you can do that with a little effort. It’s kind of hard to review Grand Teton National Park just because it is such an amazing place. There is something for everyone and the park and outfitters have made every attempt to make the park as accessible and enjoyable as possible. So plan your trip early and you will not be disappointed.","May 13, 2016",Grand Teton is a must see National Park,773,"Westminster, Colorado",5

Am grateful for the numerous turnouts so one can gaze in peace and search for wildlife. We normally see buffalo, elk, antelope, deer, and even occasionally a bear. The best view of the mountains are on the road outside the park. And one shouldn't miss going on the roads east to visit some of the historical sites in the flats in front of the Tetons.

The scenery is breathtaking. Driving out from the lodge just after dawn, we were lucky enough to see a multitude of wildlife living in the region. The frost on the ground, mist over the lakes and snow-capped peaks stopped us in our tracks. With this as a background we were also fortunate to see herds of Bison and Elk in their natural habitat.At the Southern end of the park lies Jackson a picturesque old trading post, founded at the start of the 19th century. It is now a bustling mountain town, home to artists and back-packers in summer and thronged with skiers and adventurers in winter. This is a town well worth stopping in. Fabulous art galleries are interspersed with boutique shops and fantastic eateries.On our return to Flagg Ranch, we were treated to a Park Ranger presentation on the wildlife to be found in the park and Bear Safety. This was undertaken outside, overlooking the river and to the sound of Elk and Coyote and beside a big camp fire. Fresh warm cookies were supplied to ward off the chill, one of which was also enjoyed by a local squirrel who made off with one bigger than himself!There are numerous scenic drives and trails to keep even the most adventurous happy.

Grand Teton,"The Grand Tetons are one of those majestic areas in North America. You can just sit and watch the sunset and think to yourself that there is a great power. The hikes are all well within the range of a novice, and some areas that will challenge even the more hardcore hikers. If you were to ask me if the trails are as hard as Yosemite hikes; I would say no. However, the wildlife can only be challenged by the Alaskan frontier. My teenagers enjoyed just taking their water bottle and hiking throughout the many miles of hiking trails. Although, be warned that there is an active bear population. Nothing to fear, but good common sense and knowing the proper protocol will make for a safe hike. In other words, don't pack a freshly cooked steak or don't approach a mother bear and her cubs.

Grand Teton,"The minute we drove into the valley from Jackson I knew this was paradise. The spectacular tetons were breathtaking. The wildlife diversity was awesome. We saw a sizable herd of pronghorns, a red fox searching for lunch (and ignoring us), a huge bull moose watching over a moose cow & her calf right next to the road. Several bugling bull elk were looking for females. Just to hear them calling gave you chills. It felt like we were transported back in time before white men ever stepped foot in here. We actually saw more animals here than Yellowstone. Jenny lake was a jewel, so clear & beautiful. Jenny lake lodge's architecture was beautiful too. So much to see. We took several day trips all over the park. All the different visitor centers have such great people working in them. I couldn't, think of a better place to work. Our only regret was we didn't see bears. Maybe next time.

Grand Teton,"This is one of the most visited US National Parks for a good reason! If bordering Yellowstone National Park was not enough, GTNP has a rich history, amazing views, geological history, world class fishing, wildlife viewing, rafting the Snake River, great accommodations and some of the best mountain climbing in the world! I have been to GTNP every summer for the past 25 years and can always find a new and interesting place. There is a fee to enter the park but very reasonable for seniors and if you are visiting numerous National Parks within one year period. One lane roads are posted at 45-50 MPH so drive slowly and be careful for wildlife and cyclists. The park does have a separate bike path next to the road so be sure to bring your bicycles! Best time to drive the park roads are early morning for sunrise photos of the Grand Teton range and wildlife. Evenings and before sunset are also nice. During the day you can drive the park roads and stop at numerous pull outs, some with bathrooms. Plenty of places to visit with historical markers and such. Camping, lodges and ranches provide accommodations inside the park. There is limited options for groceries and gas within the park and Jackson Hole Wyoming is the closest large town with all you need. Be sure to take binoculars, camera, sunscreen and consult with your doctor on traveling to altitude. Grand Teton National Park is approximately 6,600' in elevation, headaches and shortness of breath is common for new arrivals from sea level. The airport could not be located any closer but fares can be expensive. The park itself is closed to vehicular traffic during winter so check with the National Park Service for specific details. Summertime is the busiest time of year for the park.

I spent a week camping throughout the park, Id wake up at sunrise every morning and do another hike. Cascade Canyon will go down as one of my favorite hikes Ive ever done, be sure to check it out. The boat ride across Jenny Lake is also a fun thing to do if you aren't in the mood for hiking.

Certainly don't miss the spectacle of Yellowstone, but it will be a true shame if you miss the scenery of Grand Teton NP. Experience Yellowstone for all it is, and then relax at the Grand Tetons.

Grand Teton,"Grand Teton National Park is on my top 5 list of National Parks I have visited (and I have visited quite a few). I have visited the park a few times and it is one of those places that always leaves me breathless. On our recent trip (August 2015) to many of the National Parks (Glacier, Yellowstone, Theodore Roosevelt, Wind Cave, Teton) I was very much looking forward to seeing this park again. In fact we added to our vacation as we were planning to make sure that we hit this park. Unfortunately, we happened to hit it at a time that the wild fires were burning in several West Coast areas and the smoke from them decided to settle into Grand Teton National Park. The first day we drove through on our way from Yellowstone to our hotel in Jackson Hole we couldn't even see the mountains! If you've ever been there this will surprise you because the mountains are big and beautiful and all around you. We decided to try it again the following morning because we were hoping some of the smoke had cleared. Well.....it was better than the day before but it was still pretty smokey. We were able to see sunrise at Jenny Lake but it was a little disappointing with the lack of visibility. Still a wonderful place and nothing you can do about natural events. Oh well...just means I have to go back!Do not miss the views of Jenny Lake or the views from the Chapel of Transfiguration if you are headed to the park. Put this on your bucket list!

I want to add that after hiking Teton, Yellowstone hikes were not as rewarding. However, the Yellowstone thermal features are a must. So ideally, stay near Teton and do most of your hiking there. Then take 1-2 days to drive to Yellowstone to visit the main thermal sites (luckily they are south of Yellowstone, the part closest to Teton).","December 8, 2015",Combine Teton & Yellowstone,12,"Chicago, Illinois",5

The place where we were staying was almost at the end of the park. One minor problem we had was there was not much signage and the place where we were staying nobody picked up the phone after 7:00 pm and we were a little tense as to where our accomadations were exactly. The Jackson Lake Lodge where we stayed was absolutely beautiful and the staff were very courteous. The park itself is stunning. The mountains are incredibly beautiful, the lakes are very nice and the trails are very varied. Carry bug spray and you are all set for great hikes.

There are over 200 miles of trails to explore and the area is ideal for mountaineering, hiking, camping, fishing and its alpine terrain has wildlife, lakes and the Snake River to enjoy. No roads cross the Tetons, but those along the eastern side provide great views of the mountains including the Jenny Lake Scenic Loop leading to the enormous 13,700ft Grand Teton Mountain.

It is right beside for the ski lift which has great views and the possibility of an exhilarating bike ride back down. It is only few minutes from the Moose - Wilson Road which is great for those early morning drives in search of wildlife and we were fortunate to see some moose grazing in a roadside lake.

Grand Teton,"While the Grand Teton listing found elsewhere in Trip Advisor has attracted many reviews of the national park, it was not specific to the mountain itself, a unique destination in its own right worthy of your consideration. Dr. Hayden in 1872 called it ""the shark's tooth."" Views of the peak from the valley floor are spectacular but the closer you approach this mountain the more it will reward you. A strenuous 4.6 mile dayhike from the Lupine Meadows trailhead brings you to Garnet Meadows, immediately beneath the towering Middle Teton. It becomes more arduous to hike to the 11,600 foot lower saddle between the Middle and the Grand. Please talk to rangers at any GTNP visitor center for information regarding these breathtaking options. But to approach the summit requires technical expertise and even more guidance; a permit is required for backcountry camping and the best way for a first-time attempt on the summit includes this. In case you seek the easy or ""walk-up"" route to the top, there is not one. Of the 38 distinct climbing routes with many variations in between, none of them are not technical. A very skilled climber under dry conditions may go up in shorts and running shoes if the weather is good, but those are some rather broad caveats: seasoned climbers have perished that way. Please visit the Grand Teton via the Exum Mountain Guides or the Jackson Hole Mountain Guides or, on your own, in a party if you are well experienced and know how to protect yourselves and to decipher the meanings of descriptions in guidebooks.This place will blow you away. It is the iconic American mountain. Please be safe and open up all of your senses.","November 4, 2015",the Matterhorn of North America,543,"Jackson, Wyoming",5

We had always wanted to stay at the Jackson Lake Lodge and our wishes came true. Fantastic, and such views from the lodge of Jackson Lake, Mt. Moran and fellow Teton peaks, elk, wolves and birds of every stripe. We loved catching the rising sun at Oxbow Bend and walking the trails of Jenny Lake and Coulter Bay. Signal Mountain was a great drive with wonderful panoramic views. So much to do...and in September without the crowds. People tend to visit Grand Teton because they love the outdoors, respect the wildlife and scenic treasures, are courteous and ready for the maximal overall experience.

Grand Teton,"This park was georgeous. I couldn't stop taking photos of the mountains. The scenery was fabulous. We saw lots of wildlife, too. Within the first few hours we saw a black bear, antelope and mule deer. We saw lots of bison, lots of antelope, 5 moose and many deer. We flew into Jackson Hole and stayed in Jackson. The drive into the park was short and Jackson was a neat town. The visitor center at Jackson is nice. It has a little more content than most of the centers.We stopped at Moose. It is one of the few places to get food, gas and sundries. We ate pizza on the porch. The pizza wasn't great (nor was the service) but the view was fabulous.We stopped at the Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitors Center just by Moose. The center is worth a visit. You will only need 30 minutes to see it.We drove around Jenny Lake and then drove up towards Jackson Lake. We took the road to the top of Signal Mountain to see the valley. The view is good from there. We stopped at the Jackson Lake Dam and saw a bald eagle.We drove to Colter Bay and went to the visitor's center. There is a small store there to buy groceries and things. While driving through the park, we stopped may times. When we saw people pulled over by the roadside we would stop to see what they were viewing. We saw lots of animals that way. We saw our second bear because we pulled over to the side to see what another couple was doing. We met the nicest people this way. There are lots of hiking trails, there is much scenery and lots of fun to be had. What a great place to visit!","October 13, 2015",Gorgeous!,29,"Bernville, Pennsylvania",5
Grand Teton,"We planned to spend there only 3 days. This short stay turned into a 6 days long visit, and we will be back to do some multiday hiking and backcountry camping. What a great park!! It is shadowed by neighboring Yellowstone, but it really shouldn’t. Both parks are different, both offer different attractions. In Grand Teton it is challenging hikes (especially for those who like multiday backcountry camping trips), dramatic vistas. It also offers plenty of wildlife (although not as displayed as in Yellowstone) and fewer crowds especially when you hike past the canyons. I read comments about this place being boring, and if you just do your sightseeing from the car, or stick to paved walkways I can understand why the impression. If you hike, you will think different. We took long (up to 12 hrs) hikes and on one of them we only met 2 other guys. One thing I learned on more than one occasion – be always prepared for an animal encounter no matter how busy or secluded the trail is. We had a sow with 3 cubs about 50 yards from our campsite, huge elk at the campsite, moose cow with a calf on the trail, bear encounter, missed another bear on another trail by few minutes... in other words wildlife is everywhere. You might not see any but if you come with pets or kids keep an eye on them because this is not a zoo with fenced in animals. Having a bear spray is really a good idea. A lot of trails lead through dense vegetation, along river and waterfalls, and have several blind turns. It is easy to startle an animal.","October 13, 2015",Put your hiking shoes on!,276,,5

Grand Teton,"While Yellowstone can be a bit overwhelming, both in scenery and crowds, our day at Grand Tetons was refreshing and beautiful. Basically it's a drive by the majestic Grand Teton mountain range with stops along the way for visitor centers at each end, many places to pull in and hike, a couple of lodges, and Jenny Lake. Gentle boat tours on the Snake River is also available. Highly recommended is either a hike or a boat ride across Jenny Lake, and the scenic drive up Signal Mountain for great views. A round trip can be done in a day, and I regret not getting to the south east corner of the park--there are some good photos to be had there. The park adjoins Yellowstone at its south entrance. Not knowing the area, we got a cabin that we thought would be nicely situated in between Yellowstone and Teton, but we ended up having to drive through Yellowstone a lot anyway to get to other places so we would have done better to find a place at one of the entrance cities of Yellowstone. Old Faithful Inn is perfectly situated for a trip into Grand Teton, since it's on the lower loop of that park. The way we did it was to drive outside the parks from Island Park, ID, down through farmland and into Jackson Hole, a stop in JH to eat second breakfast and walk around, then up through Grand Teton Park Road and up to the south entrance of Yellowstone, stopping at Old Faithful Inn for a late dinner and to see the geyser one last time, then back out through the west entrance and down to our cabin. Not a bad day, but I wouldn't recommend it.","October 2, 2015",AMAZING! And more managable than Yellowstone,157,"Chattanooga, TN",5

When I think of the Rocky Mountains, these are the views I think about. There are many pull off's along the way where its possible to take great pictures (most seem to be on the side going toward Jackson and traffic can make crossing back and forth difficult) and there are stops along the way (camp grounds and so forth). The lower portion of the drive along the Grand Teton's is outside the National Park itself and is, therefore, at no charge. The park contains parks, well developed camp grounds (with stores, laundries, and shower facilities) and beautiful lakes, which reminded us of Scotland. Grand Teton is truly a wonderful experience and is well worth the charge. It was moderately busy when we were there in September (it closes mid October); however, I was told that the shoulder seasons (including September) are much better visiting times than the summer itself when it is very crowded.","September 20, 2015",Incredible,49,"New Market, Maryland",5

Grand Teton,"This church has a background that would make it difficult to concentrate on a sermon. It is stunning in its beauty, and it makes for a beautiful photo opportunity from an outside standpoint. However, even with quality photographic equipment, it would be very difficult to capture a stunning photo of the interior of the chapel and the mountains as well. If a photographer would choose to capture this image, you would need to light the interior of the chapel and / or come at a very early or very late time of day. No matter what your interest, this chapel is worth a visit when you vacation in the Tetons! Enjoy!!","September 20, 2015",Beautiful Scenery- begs to be photographed!,30,"Cokato, Minnesota",5

If you can, take the boat across Jenny Lake (it runs something like every 15 minutes between 10am and 4pm from South Jenny Visitor's Center) and hike half-a-mile to Hidden Falls. It's worth the effort! And if you get stuck on the other side, you can hike three miles to get back to South Jenny. This 30-mile string of mountains is beyond beautiful! Someone else said ""breathtaking"", or I would have said it, too! If you're staying close enough, you'll also have time for a piece of Yellowstone, my all-time favorite National Park.

When we were there other times (in our younger days) we hiked in the mountains. This time we drove the various roads thru the Park and I enjoyed it just as much. The time of day makes such a difference in the appearance of the mountains. Take time to enjoy them morning, noon and sunset. I believe this is my favorite national park.","September 19, 2015",Outstanding Vistas,39,,5

Most folks hike thru without paying attention to what is going on off the trail, spotted a female moose working it's way down to some vegetation 50 feet off the trail. She came down and ate for about a half-hour. We did the same trail another day and went to Bradley Lake first then to Taggert, moderate the whole way. While sitting on the rocks along Taggart Lake spotted a Black Bear swimming across the lake, it got out and made it's way up into the woods. The view of the Tetons from Taggart Lake is spectacular.","September 17, 2015",Taggart Lake Trail in Grand Teton Park,3,"Raleigh, North Carolina",5

We could not get a room in the park in the second week of September. When we go again, we'll try to book a room in the park. That would give us more time to explore. We spent 2 days in the park. Walking the trails, taking lots of photos. Some trails are not marked too well once you start out. Many are long so staying in the park would help. If you are 2+ years old you can get a senior pass from any National Park for $10. This is a life time pass and gets you into all NP's for free.

There are many other stops along the way but time did not allow us to stop by them. Please make sure that you stop by the Visitor Center near the entrance of The Park.

We hadn't been to the Grand Tetons (barring driving through from Yellowstone to Jackson). There was a variety of activities.

Grand Teton,"On a recent road trip where, amongst other things, we visited 6 national parks, we spent an afternoon and the following morning in Grand Teton National Park. Think this was one of my favourites - definitely enjoyed more than Yellowstone. We stopped in at the visitor centre in Jackson about lunch time and had the good fortune to talk to an employee there who was obviously quite passionate about the park. He drew us a route on the map and pointed out things of particular interest which we would in all likelihood have missed had we not spoken to him first. For instance, in one example of many, he told us of a side dirt road in which a large herd of bison had been seen that week. We pretty much followed his suggestions to the letter, and saw so many wonderful animals (bison, elk, a wonderful moose and a bald eagle, coyotes, etc., etc.) as well as other attractions. The Tetons themselves were not overly clear on either day - we wondered if forest fires much further away might be creating the haze, but they were glorious nonetheless. Would definitely recommend a visit here!","September 12, 2015",Spectacular!,191,"Stittsville, Ontario",5

We visited from the Southern entrance and went up to Jackson Lake and then back down to Jenny Lake - this will now be my new happy place. It is clean and absolutely beautiful.

As a tip, buy your bear spray at the visitor's center.

I feel that if God had a mountain house, it would be in the Tetons. I also feel overwhelmed by their beauty in all seasons. Only a divine power could have created something that beautiful. Most people go to that location to see Yellowstone National Park. While it is also a treasure, nothing compares to the Tetons. The float trip down the Snake River inside Grand Teton National Park is a remarkable experience. Riding a horse in the Tetons comes next.

Each is unique and has a name - Grand Teton, Cathedral Group, and Teton Glacier as examples. No matter the time of day or weather conditions, the Tetons are a dramatic reminder of Nature's Grandeur.

In addition to the loop roads that make viewing easy, and offer lots of photo ops, visits to Jenny Lake and Signal Mountain should not be missed. Take the boat across Jenny Lake. Caution on the short trail to see the waterfall if your knees give you trouble. The trail is rocky and steep enough to feel it the next day (and the next...).

Camping inside the park is good, but we stayed at the Coulter Bay campground, which had nice sites but HORRIBLE bathrooms (the sinks in the womens bathroom had a facet with cold water that you had to hold to keep the water on...no hooks or pegs or shelves to set anything down.

The cabin was basic but clean and comfortable enough. The staff were great too. Sadly our stay was marred as we left our back-pack by Jenny Lake one afternoon and when we went back to get it, it had already been taken. Unfortunately, whoever had taken it decided they liked it and didn't bother handing it in. They obviously had a slither of kindness in them as they removed our phones and left them on a table in a completely different location. Some very kind person found them and handed them in. (If you ever read this review - thank you!) All the staff we spoke to around the park were so helpful in trying to locate the back-pack. We were eventually contacted by a volunteer from the Lost and Found team who told us the phones had been handed in. They arranged to forward them to our hotel for us to collect on our last night in the US. Thank you so much for this. We left Grand Teton feeling very fed up due to the loss of the backpack and its contents, however, the helpfulness of the staff really cheered us up and we can now look back on our stay here with very fond memories.

Restaurant and cafe food is as good as any I've eaten in the big city or at a fast-food chain.And if you want to visit Yellowstone, it is a short drive North to the entrance.","August 21, 2015",Two Weeks in the Grand Tetons,5,"Kirksville, Missouri",5
Grand Teton,"The Grand Tetons are one of the most recognizable, and picturesque mountain ranges to see. I had seen pictures of them throughout my life, but seeing them in person was truly amazing. When I first arrived at the park it was very overcast and cloudy; the mountains were partially obscured and had an almost haunted look. Later after the clouds departed, the mountains contrasted against the crisp blue sky really took on their stunning look I had expected. Tons of activities, trails, and other things to do in the park. Read up on wildlife before exploring and take precautions; there are bears and even grizzlies in the area.I'll review some hikes & activities I did in the individual TA entries for Grand Teton NP, but for the park as a whole, it's a must see!","August 21, 2015",Majestic,79,"Utica, Ohio",5
Grand Teton,"The mountains are breath-taking, but they are serious about bears. Everywhere you go are signs warning you about the bears and if you go swimming at String Lake, there are plenty of metal cabinets to store your food. Having said that, I did not see any bears In fact, I didn't see much of any wildlife other than rabbits and birds. However, that may be more due to the time of year. Otherwise, Grand Tetons is gorgeous although I'm not sure how much young children would enjoy it, as there aren't as many activities as, say, Yellowstone. But if you are looking for some of the most breath taking scenery in the US, then Grand Teton lives up to the hype","August 21, 2015","Beautiful scenery, but probably not exciting enough for young children",17,"Poughkeepsie, New York",5

Grand Teton,"We really enjoyed Grand Teton NP. From the moment you see the majestic Tetons, you are mesmerized by their glory. We only had a day and decided the visitor center, Jenny Lake and driving around was the best for our limited time. We enjoyed the info at the visitor center for about 1/2 Bergen headed to Jenny Lake. WOW... Gorgeous. We found a hiking trail around the lake and one that lead us down to the lake where no one was. Very secluded and quiet. The drive around was relaxing and worth it. Enjoy God's beauty....","August 20, 2015",Very relaxing,18,"Johnson City, Texas",5
Grand Teton,"Rising 7,000+ feet above the valley floor, the Teton's are an amazing sight to behold. The park is typically well run, with a well appointed visitor center at both the North and South ends, with many scenic roads traveling the length of the park. Highly recommend hiking around Jenny Lake and driving to the top of Signal mountain.

Grand Teton,"While Yellowstone seems other-worldly, the Tetons provide sheer beauty. The big craggy mountains are gorgeous. The best time to see them is in the morning when the sun is just peaking over the eastern mountains and it seems to highlight the Tetons. In the evenings, the Tetons' details get masked in the shade of the setting sun. Definitely get up early one morning to see the mountains or take an early morning hike.","August 17, 2015",Breathtaking scenery,609,"Panama City, Florida",5
Grand Teton,"Everybody knows of and praises Yellowstone Park and for good reason. Yet Grand Teton to its south completes the Yellowstone experience and to many is the superior destination in its own right. Geologically, historically and ecologically, Teton compliments Yellowstone so perfectly that one park is not complete without the other. This is missed by those visiting Ynp only from the north, west or east.That being said, Teton pleases with grandeur unique to itself and to many even more movingly than in any other place on earth.","August 17, 2015",Every bit the equal of Yellowstone or greater,543,"Jackson, Wyoming",5
Grand Teton,"Whether you are driving toward Yellowstone after leaving Jackson Hole, or leaving Yellowstone headed toward Jackson, be sure to take the cutoff that runs through the middle of Grand Teton NP. The views of Jenny Lake are well worth the side trip. Yellowstone has a unique flavor, but the views of the Tetons across Jenny Lake are wonderful.

Grand Teton,"We always go through the south entrance to Grand Teton to get to Yellowstone, This time we had a lot of vacation time and explored Grand Teton Park, The Park has numerous back roads that are car friendly and picnic heavens. We also took the Grand Teton Lodge Company's dinner cruise to Elk Island. I enjoyed the crew, especially our host; Annalesa, and the dinner was on the better side of so-so. Be aware however, there is no awing or cover at the picnic tables (Although the crew sat under an erected tarp)and you eat dinner in the direct sunlight. I imagine the Park disallows building on the island but this exposure would be hard on the elderly or the very young so take a large hat. Coulter Bay campground is first rate if you can find a spot. We found the diesel prices to be cheaper than any other city in Wyoming. Thank you National Park System for doing such a nice job!","August 16, 2015",Take the time to visit,14,"Arvada, Colorado",5

Grand Teton,"There is something fabulous about this park. I could look at the Mountains all day . We visited Jackson Lake, Jenny Lake, & Colter Bay. Colter has old pioneer cabins. We only stayed there one night. It is no frills. The restaurant on property was good & had items to please everyone. You can walk to waters edge. Boat rentals there & the view is priceless. Lake & Tetons. Gorgeous. Really worth a stop. Walking trails along the lake. There is a good visitors center at Colter with tons of information to plan adventures near. You do not need a pricey tour. They are a waste of money. If seeking animals. Ask the entry rangers. They know where animals have been spotted. Look for groups stopping & pointing. Usually an animal has been spotted. Have an amazing time. This is a trip I would do again. Love this place!!","August 15, 2015",Tetons- love this place!,6,"Kilgore, Texas",5

We got a very early start and saw A LOT of wildlife....moose, bison, pronghorn. We stopped at Jenny Lake to take in the view. The loop took us almost 4 hours and that was taking our time. This can't be missed. We enjoyed it more than Yellowstone.","August 12, 2015",Wow! It will not disappoint,27,"Tulare, California",5
Grand Teton,"Visited in August. Weather during our trip was perfect. 70s during the day, and sunny so shorts were perfect attire. Had a senior with us so we got a senior pass from the visitor center. Saved us a lot of money as a senior pass is $10 for a lifetime pass and a typical carload charge can be upwards of $50. So make sure to get your park pass. Well worth it. Pays for itself in 1 visit. Lots to do here from the Jackson Lake Dam to Jenny Lake crossing by boat (NOT ACCESSIBLE so bear that in mind if you take the shuttle boat across). Set aside a whole day. If you plan to hike you probably need a couple of days. Don't miss at least a drive through this beautiful place.","August 12, 2015",Beautiful Views and a picnic spot for all.,53,"Louisville, Kentucky",5

Grand Teton,"Traveling to the Grand Teton National Park is one of the thrills of my traveling experience. I found the setting breathtaking and I don't mean due to the altitude. The vistas were absolutely stunning, bar none. At first, I felt like a kid in a toy shop! Which way to turn next??? Whether I was at the bottom of the mountain range looking up or near the top of a mountain looking down, the site before me was awesome .. and that is using the word in its true sense. I was in awe!! I also faced the notion that I really am rather insignificant in the total scheme of things. The majesty of the vista also caused me to want some time 'off to the side' for a bit to contemplate life and those things that really matter and those that are frivolous.

Grand Teton,"Grand Teton was on the way to Yellowstone and we thought 1.5 days would suffice. Wrong. Turns out we enjoyed the Grand Tetons more than Yellowstone and wished we could have spent at least another full day to do more hiking. Grand Teton seemed less crowded, had fewer cars, and traffic flowed much better than at Yellowstone. A volunteer based in Jackson suggested the Taggart-Bradley Lakes hike which is 6 miles round-trip. Most hikers go to Taggart Lake first and then would have to hike UP the switchbacks to get to Bradley Lake, but the ranger advised us that at the first fork, take the trail to Bradley Lake so that we would be hiking DOWN the switchbacks to Taggart Lake. What a difference that made!!! He also suggested that we begin our hike early in the day because the parking lot and trails get crowded. He was right!","August 9, 2015",Magnificent and majestic,207,California,5

We hear a lot more about Grand Teton's book ends - Jackson Hole to the south and Yellowstone to the north - but GT steals the show. With a fraction of the crowds rolling through Yellowstone and vertical views like nowhere else in the US, the Grand Tetons are a MUST for anyone who loves our national parks.

Grand Teton,"We took a 4 day family trip to the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone National Parks. After reading many reviews I thought we had allowed enough time to see everything without making it so long that the kids would get bored. I have to say, we were not ready to end the trip when we had to leave. There is so much to do in the Grand Teton National park area that we didn't get to do. It would have been great to rent bikes and ride on the bike trails, rent a boat on Jenny Lake, do more hikes in the area, horseback ride around the area. We were there mainly to see animals for the kids, which we saw plenty. But if we go back I think I would focus less on seeing the animals and more on experiencing some much needed downtime in one of the most beautiful areas of the world. You really don't have to look for the wildlife, they are there naturally in everything you do. They are like the icing on the cake of a wonderful outdoor vacation in nature. It's definitely a trip I feel we have to do again.","August 6, 2015",There is SO much to do in Grand Teton National Park!,5,"Phoenix, Arizona",5

I recommend to take a park road and drive close to the mountains this does not take much more time than main road and you are much closer, binoculars are also fun to use here to look at the ridge and try to find climbers there. You have a chance to see a Moose or Elk as we did. We just drove through it on the way from Yellowstone to Salt Lake City after morining sightseeing in Y it is on the way and made a perfect day.

Grand Teton,"The Grand Tetons are a wonderful place to visit. The scenery is beautiful. The mountains remind me of the Swiss Alps, but there are far less of them. The lakes are wonderful to look at especially if you can get a photo with a reflection of the mountains. Lots of animals to see. The Snake River adds to the enjoyment. This is MUCH smaller than Yellowstone. The park can be toured in about a day. If you want to add some activities like a float trip or white water trip, add another day or two. Restaurants in the area are generally average to above average with a few exceptions (both ways). Prices are above average.The views in the Grand Teton National Park are not as varied as Yellowstone. There are no thermal areas, no Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and no lodges in the park in various locations (as in Yellowstone).

We started with ranger guided tour to Taggart Lake that was a nice intro to the region. Due to cloud cover we did not get a great view of the Tetons that morning, but the hike was still wonderful. Day 2 we when to Jenny Lake and Hidden Falls, taking the boat on the outbound leg and walked back round the lake. Saw 4 bears on this trip! The next day we took the Lookout Rock trail from Jackson Lake Lodge and saw lots of wild life, the view of the Tetons was spectacular.

Figured it would be worth it since we've never seen it. I suppose it was worth it, but not a slam dunk. The mountains are certainly scenic...reminds me of pics I've seen of the Alps. But as a drive-through destination, it's kind of one-note. In Zion, there's something new around every curve. Here, it's pretty much just the same view over and over. Perhaps more exciting if one has the time to get out and hike/boat. As a drive through, it's nice, but borderline call if it's worth adding 1-2 hours to your drive. Actually, found some of the drive exiting Yellowstone and south of Jackson to be almost as ""scenically involving"".","July 17, 2015","Scenic, but a bit one-note",90,"Long Beach, California",4

If you are 62 or over you can get a senior pass for $10 that is a lifetime pass good for all the national parks. They do check your ID and the pass is good for all people in the vehicle, so your spouse or children, friends etc do not need a pass.

Many places to pull off and take in the beauty of it. It offers so much nature between the dams built by beavers to the wild flowers blowing in the wind. Walking on flat trails or hiking up towards the hills. Lazy and relaxing or hard core bike rides along the road itself. Rentals are nearby to offer you that experience. Helicopter tours are available to get an up close picture of the peaks. Jackson Hole is the city that is still sinking to this day because of the Grand Tetons.

When we visited in 2008, they had just begun construction of the park's paved bike path. This is not completed from Jackson, WY all the way to Jenny Lake Lodge. I would never ride a bike in this park on the roads (too many people do the old ""drift and jerk"" when trying to look at the views while driving).

Grand Teton,"We landed at the Jackson Hole Airport,grabbed a rental car and headed north toward Yellowstone. We entered the Grand Teton Park at the Moran entrance and within minutes arrived at Oxbow Bend and were overwhelmed with the beauty of the Tetons. The park roads were in great shape and we were surprised how quickly we could get from one attraction to another. We simply followed the scenic route stopping whenever we wanted. We saw bison, eagles and a few deer. We also stopped at the Moose Entrance and went to the visitor center where we got to touch all sort of animal pelts, planned a future 3 day hike and watched a 20 minute film about the park. Afterward we headed south and passed the numerous old homesteads and were back to Jackson Hole in 5 hours.

Grand Teton,"One of the prettiest parks I've been to - it is breathtaking. There are many clearly marked areas to visit. Check out String Lake in the morning - there is a peaceful walk. One of my favorite things was the boat ride on Jenny Lake over to the Hidden Falls - there is a short hike that is worth the walk to the falls. There are a sections that will make you breathe a little harder but I saw all ages on the trail. When you get to the falls, there is a shady spot to sit and look at the falls - it will be tough to photograph as there is harsh light and shade on them but they are really beautiful and the park does a great job on the upkeep of the trails. The park rangers are very vigilant and heavily monitor guest behavior. The monitor all groups making sure they have the correct permits in place, keep an eye out for drivers who may be drinking and insure you stay a proper distance from animals.

Grand Teton,"Grand Teton National Park surpassed my highest expectations. Gorgeous, accessible, and beautiful either up close or at a distance. To best enjoy the park, begin early in the day. We did the Taggart Lake Loop (about 3.9 miles round trip), starting about 8:30 in the morning. We were among very few in the parking lot or on the trail which made the experience that much more enjoyable. When we finished the hike, the parking load was over-full and the the trail was crawling with people. Because we had started with Taggart Lake, it meant that we got to Jenny Lake (among the most popular locations in the park) later. Jenny Lake offers the Hidden Falls and Cascade Canyon, two iconic Grand Teton sites. When we arrived, about 11, the parking lot was very crowded. (I think if you continue to the subsequent lots, parking gets a bit easier.) We were worried that the trails would be equally crowded but most people take the boat over to the falls. The walk is well worth is with appropriate footwear. (It's probably 5 miles round trip.) We walked the southern trail. The falls themselves are a bit of a crush, because of all the people coming off the ferry. Coming out of Jenny Lake, if you go north and complete the loop back to Jackson, more stunning views of the mountains that replicate the positions of Ansel Adams. I especially recommend stopping at the Snake River Overlook.Park Service personal very helpful. Entrance to Yellowstone and Grand Teton $50 which is good for one week.","July 1, 2015",Amazing Park,49,"Richmond, Virginia",5

Grand Teton,"This is one of the most breathtaking national parks in the US that I've ever visited. June was an ideal month because the days were clear, nights cold and crisp and the park was filled with all kinds of wildflowers (and animals). We did a number of lake hikes; most were fairly well used but every time you looked up the dramatic Tetons were in front of you. Would highly recommend for a day hike the 6.5 mile hike around Two Oceans Lake (not far from Jackson Lake Lodge). It seems less used than most, but was spectacular. The trail stays near the lake the entire way, with only one short but moderate climb. I'd recommend going counter-clockwise so you experience the meadows in the morning sun, and the conifer forest in the afternoon sun. Remember, however, there is no access to the lake from the trail and few places to stop to rest. We went crazy over the varieties of wildflowers and butterflies nectaring. -take pictures and ID later. Our major complaint, however -- biting flies and mosquitoes (use PLENTY of insect spray).

Great views of the mountains from many vantage points.Best place to see buffalo (and pronghorn) is at the Elk Ranch Flats turnout on the west side of the main road north to Moran Junction.To see moose, ask park personnel for ideas. One location is off a turnout on the east side of Wilson Road, which leads to the Laurance Rockefeller Preserve. From the main highway, turn left at the Moose Junction intersection. Stay on that road, past the visitor center, and turn left onto Wilson Road. This is before the pay station to enter the park. At the turnout on Wilson Road ask people already there if they have seen the moose or know where to look.Have lunch at the Signal Mountain Lodge, with a view of Jackson Lake.

We picnicked all over the park. We just enjoyed the beauty as much as we possibly could! One evening we drove down to Jackson to watch the rodeo. That was fun, but as soon as it was over we were ready to head back up to the mountains. All the rangers that we met up with were very helpful with helping us determine which trail to take or which wildlife we spotted, etc. Also the park has a great water bottle refill station in many locations. Made it so convenient to keep our bottles filled with some excellent tasting water.We were all sad to have to leave even though we were heading up into Yellowstone.

Grand Teton,"I’ve had the good fortune to visit this national park on numerous occasions, and I’m in awe every time. Some people have told me that naïve tourists have actually speeded by the Grand Tetons on their way to Yellowstone from Jackson, Wyoming. Such a mistake! Absent any hiking, tours or float trips, you could drive every stretch of the main roads (Teton Park Road and U.S. Routes 191 & 89), stop at all the turnouts and maybe even hike a short trail or two, all in one day. Of course, visiting a lodge for dining or gift shopping, plus any kind of trail or tour activity adds time … possibly measured in days. Everything in this NP is simply amazing: the Teton peaks are dramatic, the Snake River Plain is very scenic, as are most of the turnouts. The trails vary from excellent to awesome. Bottom line: JUST GO!Here are some tips/recommendations for your consideration:(1) Area residents tell me that the peak tourist season is summertime, when families are traveling with kids.(2) Teton Park Road is closed in the winter, so my preferred times to visit are in the fall before the road closes (before ski season), and in the spring just after the road opens. Naturally, this can vary from year-to-year, but I shoot for either late-May or mid-September.(3) There’s a 2-mile stretch of Moose-Wilson Road between the Teton Village and Teton Park Road that is unpaved (traversable via standard passenger car, so don’t worry) and also closed in the winter. Even if it is open, the drive will be reduced to not much more than 30 mph—slower over the rutted parts—so try not to get frustrated. Given a closure, the alternate route from Teton Village is to go south to Route WY-22, through the town of Jackson, then north on US-191.(4) All of the roadways are east of the Teton Range, so early morning will provide direct light on the mountains. Teton Park Road will get you the close-up perspective, while Route 191/89 will provide vistas with the Snake River Plain in the foreground.(5) Virtually all the turnouts are worth a stop, which means: get out of the car. The one that should not be missed is called “Oxbow Bend,” which could be the one location where more photos are taken than from any other. Other must-sees are called “Jackson Lake,” “Jenny Lake,” “Teton Glacier” and “Snake River.”","June 23, 2015",Supremely awesome; worth designing a vacation around this NP,598,"Tustin, California",5
Grand Teton,"First of all, “Thank You” to all the Trip Advisors that provided great information for my husband and I to plan & experience a trip of a lifetime! This trip report is to summarize what worked for us. • Flew to Salt Lake City from California, rented a car. Stayed 1st night at Crystal Inn in Brigham City. Wanted to be able to go to a couple of local cheap store to pick up a cheap Styrofoam cooler, some lunch snacks and a case of water bottles. Staying in Brigham City allowed us to get onto Highway 89 easily and follow Logan Canyon to Bear Lake then up to Jackson – took about 5 hours max – a beautiful drive!• Stayed in Jackson at an Airbnb home! We had a queen-size bed with private bath. Was perfect location, $70/night – about 12 miles from Grand Tetons. Bought the $25 National Park pass for both Tetons/Yellowstone. Explored all of the Grand Tetons and the Visitor Centers, and did daily hikes around the alpine lakes. When weather was rainy, we took car rides to Wildlife museum, Teton Village/tram ride, drove to Mormon Row, Kelly, and Moose-Wilson Road. We spent our last night @ Signal Mountain Lodge. Was beautiful in evening but raining in the morning – so nice to be inside Grand Tetons NP for 1 night. • Jackson has a Dollar Store and several grocery stores – we stocked up on luncheon items, snacks, fruit, bread, peanut butter and jam before we headed to Yellowstone because for the next 8 days we were only going to be in Yellowstone NP and did not want to have to purchase groceries in the park – much cheaper in Jackson. We ate peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for breakfast, had lunch snacks, but had dinner somewhere each night. Coffee was always available at every location we stayed at.• Yellowstone NP: Stayed the whole time within the park.- Stayed 2 nights at Yellowstone Lake Hotel – beautiful! Lots to see and hike in southeast Yellowstone and Hayden Valley.- Stayed 3 nights in Canyon Village – explored Norris Geyser Basin and the area in-between Norris and Canyon Village 1 day. 2nd day – explored the Canyon Area. 3rd day spent from early morning till dark at Lamar Valley. - Stayed 1 night at Mammoth Springs to explore Travertine Terraces. Hiked a couple of short trails between Canyon Village and Mammoth Springs.- Road from Mammoth Springs to Norris was under construction. Spent last night at Old Faithful Inn. Spent time exploring all the Geyser Areas and took some short hikes. Then we left at the end of the next day for West Yellowstone.- West Yellowstone – spent time at Grizzley & Wolf Discovery Center – a nice slow day and stayed another night.- Headed back to Salt Lake City – turned in our car – took airport shuttle to Sheraton Inn. Our flight was at 4pm next day – Sheraton allowed us to check out late. Had time to sightsee downtown SLC and Temple Square.- Recommended books: Lonely Planet’s Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks & Yellowstone Treasures (Janet Chapple)- National Park lodging is expensive! Make your reservations 9 months to 12 months to get the rooms/cabins that you want.- Having a cooler, food, and water allowed us to make the most of our days in the parks. Water at National Park lodging is drinkable – so bring a reusable water bottle.- If you can attend a Ranger hike/talk or evening program – they are worth it!- The was a perfect time to go if you are looking for “minimum” amount of crowds – lots on vehicles were coming in when we were leaving – glad to have gone in late May! Still alittle snow on the ground, lots in the Mountains but it did not affect any hiking/car travel.*We each brought one carry-on bag with a day pack which included a raincoat with hood, gloves, hat, and scarf for each of us – only needed the raincoat – hiked in rain one day – not bad, a fun experience. Wore hiking boots most of time but did bring sneakers which was a nice change every once in a while. Weather was more on the wet side in Grand Tetons than Yellowstone – never saw the night sky which was our biggest disappointment due to clouds every night. Saw all the animals/babies except a grizzly – both parks are amazing! Having the time to explore it all was worth all the planning.We tracked all of our expenses for our 17 day-trip – it was around $5K. We felt that we were not extremely frugal nor were we extravagant. The Park Lodging is where we spent most of our money. Car (4-door Dodge Avenger) was about $585 for 17 days. We hope this helps someone else plan their “dream trip” to Grand Tetons & Yellowstone National Parks.","June 22, 2015","Tetons/Yellowstone Late Spring 16-day trip of a lifetime!

The hiking is excellent in this park - did the hike near the Rockefeller Center with friends. It is a fairly easy three mile loop hike that is kid friendly. Lots of bears out so take Bear Spray if you hike in early summer. Rangers are very knowledgeable and helpful. This is a very easy park to get to in summer. American, United, and Delta all fly large jets into the Jackson Hole airport - which is within the Grand Teton National Park. We do the Breakfast Lake Cruise on Jackson Lake each time we come and we really enjoy that activity as well as the hiking and great places to eat.

Grand Teton,"We had spent the Memorial Day holiday in Yellowstone National Park, which was incredible. We are so very glad that we drove the extra miles to stay at the Grand Teton Lodge and see Lake Jenny as well. The vistas (the Cathedral mountains-7 sisters) are absolutely breathtaking, especially at sunset! They are not to be missed. The boat tour on Lake Jenny is well worth the modest expense. We also hiked the area and enjoyed waterfalls, overlooks, and even a snowball fight. In the area we saw a brown bear, elk, moose, and plenty of buffalo. We did not see any grizzly bears on our trip. Binoculars and a good SLR camera are essential to take all of this in, but my iPad took some great pictures and allowed me to upload them to facebook to share with my friends. Be prepared to get out on foot and climb the hills, a moderate feat, but if you need to be dressed for the elements and climbing moderate terrain. We spent two days at the Grand Teton Lodge. The Wi-Fi was very good. However, we felt, coming from West Yellowstone, that in comparison, the food was expensive and the portions could have been more generous, but, we did not feel as if we were ""ripped off"" since it was only two of us, but I'd be concerned if we had brought our family of five/ The formal dining area was lovely, and we had a wonderful view of the Grand Tetons at sunset, but once again, very expensive. The accommodations at the Lodge were acceptable, they were clean and slept well, but for $225.00, I have had much better rooms. However, on the second day, we had toilet problems as the Lodge had just opened that weekend and toilets had not been used that winter, so their were explosions as clogged toilets were stressed. The maintenance team could not quickly rectify the problem so they suggested that we move. We requested and received another room. The staff was efficient and friendly. The gift shops in the Grand Teton Lodge had some lovely items, it was well stocked. The artwork was well beyond our budget as tourists, but glorious to behold. We had the opportunity to travel into Jackson Hole, WY from this location for a day trip, which was a great deal of fun. We really enjoyed our stay.

We stopped at the numerous turnouts to see the mountains, view wildlife (although mostly deer, did not see a bear), and had a picnic. We stopped at the different visitor centers to learn more about the park.The next day, we entered GTNP from the opposite direction at Moose junction since we were staying at Jackson.

Grand Teton,"We visited the Tetons after 4 nights in Yellowstone. Obviously they are different types of Parks since Grand Teton is much small but there are other important differences. Animal viewing was MUCH better at Teton. We saw more animals closer up than we ever saw at Yellowstone. This included several black bear sightings, bison, elk, moose, deer, pelicans, and a variety of ducks. The park is also much more biker and hiker friendly than Yellowstone and the food options are much more plentiful and better. We did game viewing drives twice a day but the best time was between about 6:45p.m. and 8:30p.m. We stayed at the Teton Mountain Lodge and there is an interesting drive between Teton Village and Moose (1 1/2 miles of which is not paved) that we had to traverse several times. Teton Village is really nice albeit ""upscale"" and a bit pricey. There are a number of smaller lodges in the Park that you may want to check our if you want to actually be in the Park. Jenny Lake lodge looked interested but we did not stay there.

I've been going to Teton park for forty years and although I no longer climb there (probably a good thing) it's much the same as it was long ago. Of course there are more visitors and things are a bit harder but it's still one of the most sublimely beautiful and majestic places on the planet. Just don't think you'll be enjoying it by yourself.

The animals are more widespread and not as close to the road, the sights may take a little more hiking, etc. But, this is helped out by lots fewer people. The fishing, to me, was excellent and worth the effort. Sunrise, and Sunset, at Oxbow/Mt Moran are not to be missed. As a caution, in the fall it might be really cold (10-15 degrees) for Sunrise.

I also had a marmot join me in a jog down the trail which was sort of bizarre. Bear spray is a really good idea and knowing how to use it is an even better one. The boat ride on Jenny Lake provides a lovely view and is worth the ride in one direction .

Even with lousy weather, we are finding times usually early in the morning when you can see the whole mountains. Unfortunately, the week we visited was cold and rainy. However, that did not stop the wildlife. The Grizzly Bears and their cubs frequently are easy to find, we are having the best luck in the Oxbow Bend area. We have seen the sow and her two cubs for three days in a row, morning and evening. One time she came with in 25 yards of us. We now carry bear spray which is highly recommended by rangers. They will teach you how to safely use it. Many bison, elk, pronghorns and deer are also easily seen throughout the park. Hiking down along the Snake River provides lots of great vistas with reflections of the mountains in the water.

Grand Teton,"Bad weather in South Dakota meant we travelled west in our journey to Yellowstone earlier than expected, allowing us an unexpected longer stay in grand Teton. This park is included in Yellowstone NP entry fee (we had our year pass though) but is definitely a standout on its own as well, and because it isn't quite as large as Yellowstone it doesn't feel as overwhelming to complete a couple hikes. It is a different environment to Yellowstone, full of flat land filled with sagebrush (and hence deer, elk and mountain sheep) that is flanked by stunning mountains with crystal clear lakes. We went on two shortish hikes and the Jenny lake scenic drive over the day and a half we were there. The Taggart lake walk was a great fairly easy there and back again trek, with a little tough uphill section that even a whiny thing like me can cope with! We ran into an elk (literally) and a few grouse, and loved the lake view at the end. You walk through a mix of rocky trail, bit of light forest and a meadow, all allowing for lovely surrounds. The Jenny lake scenic drive scored us our first bear, and we were lucky enough to be able to watch him from just about ten or so metres (from our car obviously) all by ourselves for a good amount of time before others turned up. The Jenny lake walk is a little confusing to work out but once we picked an amalgamation of the hikes to make for a loop it was very enjoyable. Mainly wooded sections with a fair uphill (not tough though) with a marshy area to allow for moose sightings and then marmot heaven of meadow with many big warm rocks. Beautiful views of course. Definitely worth a side day trip if you are solely considering Yellowstone.","May 18, 2015",Beautiful park with amazing flora/fauna,133,"Darwin, Australia",5

A few bison were right by the road. We were hoping to see some grizzly, but no luck. However, we did see a large old moose in a river on our way back to town.

Grand Teton,"Yellowstone gets all the credit as being the first national park, and it truly is an amazing place, but a trip to Yellowstone without including the Grand Teton National Park, and in particular a view of the Teton mountains and Mount Moran is simply incomplete. The Tetons are one of the most impressive mountain landscapes in the world. My Idaho friends don't like to hear it, but if you are planning to visit, make sure you drive through on the Wyoming side. The view is that much better. If you are coming from Yellowstone, consider stopping for a snack at the Jackson Lake Lodge for an extended view of the Teton range from indoors. This will be particularly welcome in the colder months. The view from the Wyoming side is east facing so morning and early afternoon hours are generally better than the silhouetted evening hours (though this is impressive in its own right). If you are in Jackson, consider making a lunch stop at The Granary.

Rising from the valley without foothills is amazing to see. I've been going to the Tetons since I was little and after moving to Kansas City, made it a point to visit almost every year. Even though the mountains don't change, every year brought new found pleasures. The animals are plentiful and varied. The wild flowers brighten any day. The air is clean and the weather is a joy to watch. The best time to go is August if you want to avoid rain. But by August, many wild flowers are past their prime.

Grand Teton,"The park is not as stretched out as you would expect. We stayed here for a day, which is in fact good enough to get a good impression. If you wish to make some hikes, go for the longer ones. You will get to enjoy more of the nature with less humans around. Great panoramic views from both the lower flats as well as from higher grounds. It can get very crowded during the weekends.

Grand Teton,"We arrived at Grand Teton National Park in late September. The Teton mountain range rises majestically into the sky. It was an awesome sight. We spent hours in the park before we saw a single soul and then recruited a mom and daughter to take our picture. We did see bears, bison, moose, elk and many different birds. There are hundreds of miles of hiking trails for all levels of hikers.We hiked around Jenny Lake which was formed by a glacier over 12,000 years ago. The Jenny Lake trail loop is just over 7 miles. The trail was not that strenuous for this middle aged couple ( it took about 3 hours 45 minutes) There were also boat rides, camping. and a very expensive lodge. The reflection of the mountains in the lake was a breathtaking sight that I will never forget. You will not need as much time here as you do in Yellowstone, but you should go to both parks, they are very different. Even Ansel Adam's photographs do not compare to the real thing, it is a sight you need to see for yourself.","December 27, 2014",Autumn in the Tetons,62,"Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey",5

Had the place to ourselves - as in we spent a couple of hours at a beach on the edge of the lake and never saw a single person or heard a sound. Just us, huge mountains perfectly reflected in the lake and a moody sky (and thankfully no bears). It is indescribably beautiful. Photo's do not do it justice.","December 23, 2014",Beautiful,8,London,5
Grand Teton,"We visited the Grand Tetons in conjunction with our trip to Yellowstone National Park. It was a wonderful way to end our trip. Although we loved Yellowstone, the Tetons were different in a lot of ways.The mountains to start are amazing. Although it's only a 15 mile range, it is visually stunning. Similar to Yellowstone, there are wide and varied landscapes and scenery, but in our case, much less congestion. There are plenty of turnouts along the scenic route to stop and take photos or hike, but there are also less facilities available. We had underestimated the distances required to travel in YNP, so in many ways, GTNP was easier to navigate.Although we saw very few bison here, we lost count of the elk and deer that we encountered. Early mornings and dusk were the best times, and Signal Mountain Road was a prime viewing area. We arrived at Mount Moran Turnout before dawn to take pictures of the rising sun rays on the mountains. These are some of our favorite pictures from our entire trip. You can enter the park from the southern part of YNP, but the road is only open from mid-May to around the end of October. You enter on Route 26 from the west at the Moran entrance, and from Jackson on 191 from the south. The good news is that you only have to pay one entrance fee that applies to both Yellowstone and the Tetons. I certainly recommend visiting the Grand Tetons. You won't need as much time as you will in Yellowstone, but it is worth the trip!","December 20, 2014",Stunning Scenery and Wildlife,143,"Sardinia, Italy",5

Add to that all the attractions from singing ranch hands, the Jackson Shops and accommodation you can't go wrong. It's also no time at all to experience Yellowstone National Park.

There is glacial ice in the Tetons, which is cool. And the different angles of the mountains is awesome.We saw elk in the yard of a building near the visitors centers. The poor ranger couldn't keep people away who were trying to get pictures. The elk seemed content to allow photos and just kept grazing, but they are still ""wild"". They had to call in a volunteer to stand there and keep people across the drive.The prices at the gift shops were pretty reasonable, possibly due to it being October, not sure.We drove though Jackson but did not stop due to time frame.

We even saw an eagle swoop down to get a fish! ""Older"" visitors can appreciate the many level walking trails and scenic spots for photo taking. We went in early September so traffic was sparse. There are visitor's centers at each park entrance and two within the Park. Get a map so you can plan your stops. Two lakes right on The Loop make it easy for visitors who want a water adventure. Each stop is worth investigating. Note: if you only have one day and are on your way ""traveling through"" to Yellowstone's south entrance, take the highway to Moose and then up to Jenny Lake, then to Colter Bay then north to Yellowstone.

Surronded by mountains, it has buttes amid open pastures and reminds me of Cades Cove in Smokey Mountains NP, but on a much larger scale. It is cool to watch the jets come into the valley and land at the airport that is actually inside the NP. If you like skiing, you should stay in Teton Village. It has many lifts, gondolas etc coming right into the village. We were there in summer and enjoyed our stay in a condo there as well.

Grand Teton,GTNP is one of my favorites. The view of the mountains with the lakes or the Snake River in front is outstanding. We took the boat across Jenny Lake and hiked up to Hidden Falls. This was well worth the journey for the wonderful views. We began our visit in the Chapel of Transfiguration. This provided a wonderful way to start the day in prayer with a view of the mountains and the organ being played. The view from Jackson Lake Lodge is also nice as it overlooks Willow Flats. I would recommend driving all the roads and pullouts in the area. We took the road to the top of Signal Mt. for awesome views of the valley below. This park provides a peaceful retreat. One can bike or hike or just sit and enjoy the beauty. Don't miss a scenic float on the Snake River.,"September 16, 2014",Majestic Mountains,62,"Simpsonville, SC",5

You can hike and bike for miles, there are enough flat plains to cycle and hike.We stayed in Colter Bay Cabins, and got up at sunrise and stopped at the turnout after the Oxbow Bend Turnout, to get the Red glow shining on the mountains, it was great. The fog was lifting from the lake and slowly rising, and the Sun was burning it off. After sunrise we went back and had breakfast at the restaurant, before we continued our journey.Make sure you bring your camera with a panorama possibility or able to stitch pictures together so that you can capture the whole mountain range, because you do not want to lose that memory.","September 16, 2014",Fantastic,59,Innishannon,5

Those were 3-4 hour hike that was compensated by the breathtaking views! Sunrise and sunset here are to die for! Make sure you bring your camera! My top 3 favorite photo spots are: Oxbow Bend, Mormon Row and Snake River overlook. If you love to bike, this is one of the best places to do it!

Grand Teton,"A lot of reviewers have covered most of the things that you can do in Grand Teton, so I'll avoid too many specifics. It's an absolutely beautiful place and you'll be left in awe. In my opinion, if you're planning a trip; make it slightly longer and also include Yellowstone in the itinerary. It's very close and definitely adds to the trip.My personal experience has been that, Yellowstone, given it is more famous, is well laid out for the more touristy stuff. Both in terms of the facilities and trails. Grand Teton is a bit more rough and it's a good thing. You get to mix the well laid out of Yellowstone with the bit more natural Grand Teton. I spent 5 days in the region and can say that a 4-5 day trip is a minimum if you really want to spend quality time here.","September 7, 2014",Nature at its best,4,"Boston, Massachusetts",5

Great food and shopping in Jackson; friendly customer service everywhere we went. However, after about 10 a.m every morning, Jackson gets very busy with lots of folks exhibiting their cultural habits -- loud talking and laughing and crowding out other people. Some groups were made up of 8-10 people; you were kinda forced to get out of their way. Be careful when shopping. If you think an item is overpriced, it probably is. We found some souvenir shirts priced 30-40% lower than the identical shirts in a store directly across the street. -- The sights and beauty all along the Tetons and the lakes is unmatched anywhere we have traveled in this country in the last 30 years.

The ski resort is popular in the winter and the town of Jackson is busiest in the summer. Get away from the traffic and tourists that just drive around and see the wild areas that are unknown with a little research. We never even go up to Yellowstone, but I'm glad everyone else does.

Grand Teton,"There's a reason they are called the Grand Tetons. If you find yourself travelling to Yellowstone National Park (a must do trip) carve out a day or two to see the Grand Tetons. We traveled north from Park City Utah to Jackson Hole WY and into the Grand Tetons. It was amazing to experience the famous calendar photos of the Grand Tetons and Jenny Lake in real life! From Pink and Purple sunsets over the granite peaks to quiet reflections in Jenny and Jackson Lakes, every breath and every sight is one you will want to hold onto forever. I recommend a raft trip down the snake river for wildlife viewing along the base of the Grand Tetons. We saw several eagles and a baby moose. Also, wildlife crossed our paths several times while hiking. The waterfalls are phenomenal and the wildflowers are everywhere. This place is like waking up into a dream! We stayed two nights at colter bay cabins, which was nice and rustic. I would like to try to stay at Signal Mountain Lodge next time (and there will definitely be a next time) as there were many restaurant options, the view was beyond breathtaking from the facility.

The scenery is spectacular! We stayed at the Jackson Lake Lodge, which was very convenient and rustic, yet comfortable. The room had two Queen beds which was perfect. There is no TVs, no a/c and not much of an internet connection. So plan on playing family games or go to bed early. A couple of highlights for us: We took the ferry across Jenny Lake and hiked to Inspiration Point. The hike is not too difficult, but it wasn't super easy either. The view at the end was worth it. Along the way there is a nice waterfall and we saw a yellow bellied marmot for the first time.We also did the 10 mile scenic float down the Snake River which included a very nice picnic! Hamburgers, coleslaw, fruit salad, cookies, and drinks. If you are looking for a little relaxation, take the scenic float and bring your camera! We saw many eagles and other birds, but no moose on this trip. We didn't care, we enjoyed the ride with Matt and Pat our raft guides.

Over a series of days there was an opportunity to visit different parts of the park from the Snake River Basin to open prairies off the road as well as Jackson and Jenny lake to view different panorama of the Grand Tetons range as well as wildlife. Wildlife, including a grizzly bear, was abundant and best seen earlier in the day prior to 10am or mid-to-late afternoon. From a personal perspective to see the entire park and do a reasonable amount of hiking one could need anywhere from 2-3 days - in our case two days were sufficient. Each day began at/around 4:30am/5am to take sunrise and morning photographs and lasted until the late afternoon. In one case a grizzly bear was seen approximately 50-60 feet from the road as well as Elk, deer, pronghorn and other wildlife. One of the more amazing aspects related to the park is how accustomed the wildlife has become in seeing humans and consequently do not automatically run once being seen.Overall a wonderful and memory-filled experience that will never be forgotten.","August 23, 2014",Majestic Sights Blended With Wildlife,5580,"Irving, Texas",5

We stayed in Jackson for three nights, and spent two full days driving through the park. One of the major highlights of this park is taking the boat across Jenny Lake. It costs $30.00 for two adults for a round trip across the lake. After the boat docked, we hiked to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point and the views were awesome. We were told you could also take a one-way trip across the lake and then hike about 2 and one half miles back to the visitor center. We had a couple of really good lunches at Signal Lodge while in the park. i would also recommend visiting the Chapel of the Transfiguration and joining the ranger for an informative session about the history of the park. We were told the best chances for seeing wildlife was either at Oxbow Bend or at Antelope flats, where we did see bison. Of course, the best chance to see animals is either early morning or toward dusk.

Grand Teton,"This is my favorite park by far, but I'm a wildlife photographer and this place has the 'goods' in spades. There is roughly one grizzly bear for every 500 acres of this park. You can easily see moose, elk, deer and a variety of birds as you traverse this park by car or on foot. Grizzly are plentiful in this park and it behooves you to talk with the local Forest Ranger at the Visitor's center at the Moos Entrance (about 10 miles north of Jackson Hole, Wyoming on route 26). If going in June, be bear aware and don't get around huge willow stands as they are hunting in them for newly born elk calves. Get bear smart by talking to your forest ranger folks.I always go early June before the real tourist glut occurs. A lot less people, you can drive easily around the entire park. There's something for everyone. Easy trails, tough trails, places to eat from down home cooking food to the Jenny Lake restaurant that is upscale (don't come in with your hiking clothes on--you'll be turned away like we were).Jackson Lake Lodge is a fabulous landing pad in the park and I highly recommend it. We like the diner cafe in the lodge. They also have an upscale eatery there. June is the month to see grizzly bear, moose and elk down below the sundeck area of this lodge. Be there with your camera....you'll get nice shots.","August 20, 2014",Grand Tetons National Park a Hidden Jewel,145,"Sedona, Ariona",5

Grand Teton,"I adore the Grand Tetons- having first visited 26 yrs ago. On this second trip- so little had changed which was amazing. The Park has everything you could possible want if you love space and nature. Mountains, lakes, rivers, birds, incredible mammals to find, horse riding, boating, sunsets to die for, great locations to stay, and excellent roads to travel on. It is SO well managed, excellent visitors centres and it's a photographers dream landscape. Plus its next to Yellowstone. Even in the summer high months- its not too busy- compared to European roads! Best to book early before you go if you want to stay in the immediate are if the park as it is so popular. Cannot wait to return some day.

Your attention is drawn in many directions.Then, you round a curve and you see the Grand Tetons over Lake Louise and you will be lucky you don't run off the road while you stare (I almost did).See the magnificent mountains from the lodge. See where Ansel Adams took his iconic picture of the Snake River valley. See the abandoned ranch that is in the foreground of so many famous pictures of the mountains. Stay at the lodge, if you can and listen to the coyotes at night. See the moose at various spots around the lodge.Check at the square at Jackson with the Elk antler arches and the raised wooden sidewalks.You won't be sorry if you get there - you will be sorry if you miss it.","August 16, 2014",Jaw-Dropping,76,"Bay Village, Ohio",5

Well the Tetons did well. The distance of the highway from the mountains, along with great pull outs, provide for wonderful viewing opportunities. Morman row is a definite stop. The old buildings with the Teton background is beautiful. Plus Bison are often nearby for a photo too. Recommend get up early and get out before sun gets too high.

Grand Teton,"We have visited a good number of National Parks and enjoyed this one as much as any of them. The reason it is so high on our list is because it has all the beauty of any park with similar wildlife, but is far less crowded. As you travel single file through the other parks it can feel like assembly line vacation. Here the roads are not busy and you can stop or travel at your own speed. There is a place called Mormon row about 20 miles northeast of Jackson that has provided many calendar pictures. I almost hesitated to leave this review because I want to go back and find it just like it was last year. Our method of travel is in a 5th wheel and we might not have felt the same about this area if we were in a motel.","August 10, 2014",An excellent place to spend a few days,20,"Ellsworth, Kansas",5
Grand Teton,"Have traveled to The Tetons for several years and the past 2 years we stayed at the Libby Creek Campground on the northern edge of the park. About 35 miles from Jackson to the north, but well worth the scenery. This national park is a spectacular visit during any season, but we prefer late summer/early fall as the crowds have thinned out and the wildlife is starting to come around more. There are many wonderful hikes around Jackson Lake and Jenny lake to the south. Day trips are abundant and with our location, we are only 25 min from Yellowstone Ntl.

Twilight over Jackson Lake was out of this world. As the minutes passed everything began slowly turning the same color of a soft, periwinkle blue. A crescent moon rose over the mountains and the lake was so still you could see its reflection perfectly in the water. We stayed in the tent-only section of Coulter Bay campground. There was plenty of privacy and shade. I will most definitely be staying there again. We got up at 4:30 for the sunrise over Oxbow Bend and spent sunset down at Schwabacher's Landing. Saw pelicans, beavers, moose. It was spectacular.","August 8, 2014",Majestic!!,26,"Des Moines, Iowa",5

We took a balloon ride, paraglided off the top of the mountain, and did a scenic Snake River raft...we were there for 3 days and barely scratched the surface of things to do. We have been to the Swiss Alps and they have nothing on the Tetons. Jackson Lake Lodge has the best view in the valley (just on AC) and the staff of college students from around the country are bubbly and eager to serve/please.

Views from everywhere in the park are amazing. Hiking is fabulous, and the many lodges offer great food and beautiful accommodations (but fill up very quickly). It's expensive relative to many places, especially in Jackson, WY, but absolutely gorgeous. The park is also relatively small (at least compared with Yellowstone) so you can see a lot of it in one day. But I recommend staying longer than that if you can.The only downsides are bears (we didn't see any, but they recommend not leaving anything food or water or scent-related in your car overnight, which is a pain), and bugs. Definitely need good bug spray.","August 2, 2014",Even more majestic than the photos suggest,16,"Pasadena, CA",5

Grand Teton,"The centerpiece of this national park is the Grand Teton, a 4197 m horn that rises abruptly from the plains. No mountaineer can resist its appeal. There are dozens of routes, and each climber will sort her/his approach to the mountain. Unlike many ranges in the US, the Tetons have guiding services that are organized along lines that will be familiar to Europeans. Exum Mountain Guides has a concession with the NP that allows them to guide, and to keep a hut (really, a glorified tent) in the Lower Saddle, from which they escort dozens of aspiring climbers to the summit of the Grand via the trade route every day in summer. That is no different from the herding of novices up the Mont Blanc or the Matterhorn by the Chamonix and Zermatt guides' cooperatives, respectively. For those with more experience, time and money, Exum will provide private guiding at low (i.e., 1:1) guide:climber ratio, on routes of any difficulty. For a climb of the complete Exum (one of the infamous 50 classic climbs of North America), they asked for a climbing CV, one day of private cragging (on Guide's Wall in Cascade Canyon, a 6 pitch route at 5.9 max) to evaluate competence, a day to approach the Lower Saddle, and a day to summit and get out to the trailhead. Logistics were well organized, and the guides were as competent as I have seen anywhere in the world. Also, unlike many guide operations in Europe, Exum is eager to guide technical rock climbs in which each and every pitch is belayed (e.g. Irene's Arete). I strongly recommend this highly professional operation.","August 1, 2014",Summit Grand Teton with Exum Mountain Guides,63,"Bethesda, Maryland",5

Every time I see this range of mountains they awe me - just like the first time. I never tire of coming here. The line of peaks are something to behold as is the whole river valley. The combination of rivers, lakes, meadows and trails in this park make for endless opportunities for adventure, fun and photo opportunities.

The views of the Tetons themselves are amazing and take on different life with different lighting. You can hit the same place twice and swore you've never seen anything like it the second time around. The crowds around Jenny Lake Visitor center spoil that area, but there are many more isolated and less crowded options nearby.

We went early June, upper 50's, perfect for hiking, not a lot of people. The most crowds we saw were at Jenny Lake. We took the boat across which I recommend. Hiked to Hidden Falls which was beautiful. Continued on to Inspiration Point. If you are afraid of heights I would not go the full distance. You can get a beautiful view half way up.

Grand Teton,"We planned a family vacation of 14 people ranging from 8 to 79 to Jackson, the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone. The Tetons are my favorite, not to say that I loved Yellowstone, too. What I loved about the Tetons, were the trails, the views, the majesty of the place. I always caught my eyes going to them. If you like to hike, there is a wide variety of difficulty. Around String lake and Leigh Lakes, easy. Jenny Lake moderate up to Hidden Falls. Inspiration Point is a little more difficult, especially if you are afraid of heights and edges! That's me, but I still did it. So did my 8, almost 13 and 15 year olds. A recommendation from a river guide took us to Phelp's Lake, a great hike where we saw a grizzly bear cross 30 yards in front of us. We did have bear spray. Yes, there is such a thing. We didn't know until we read up on Yellowstone. Overall, one of my favorite places. Would definitely go back. The 79 year old did not hike.","July 9, 2014","Grand, indeed!",23,,5

Grand Teton,It's hard to say what it's really like here. You have to experience it in person. Everywhere you look the views are breath taking and spectacular. Take time to drive the speed limit(45 or less) visit the pull-ins for views that you won't believe. A previous writer said he/she didn't like following at 45mph. Seems strange to make that comment as the posted legal speed limit is 45 mph or less in some high traffic areas. One of the reasons why so many animals are killed by cars each year is because people like him don't obey the law. Protect the animals that so many come here to see.,"July 8, 2014",Breath Taking,690,"Louisville, Kentucky",5

The drive through the outside of the park is scenic, but a nice hike in the park would do it even more justice. Our favorite short hike is Jenny Lake Trail--you can take the boat back afterwards if you want a different view of the Tetons. A more ""serious"" hike up to Inspiration Point will also give you a new perspective of Moose, Wyoming. Just can't say enough about this park.

We used GaperGuide, a GPS that you rent at lots of points near the Tetons or Yellowstone. It even told fun facts, the best bathrooms, wildlife info, and trail information. It was wonderful and always knew where we were and gave us lots of park information that we would have missed without it. The Barker-Ewing Scenic Raft trip on the Snake River was terrific.

I would recommend that hikers ask for specific trail guides at the gates of the park to ensure you know how to access the trail heads and exactly how long those hikes are going to be--it's easy to underestimate.

If you are wary of the hike, you can also opt to take the Boat Shuttle, which will take you closer to Inspiration Point (the hike would only be about 30 minutes after you get off the boat).

Grand Teton,"Our first hike in the Grand Teton National Park brought us to the Jenny Lake Loop Trail. At 7.30am we already saw a Moose very close to the visitor center standing in the river. With beautiful weather and well equipped with hiking poles we started off going east around the Lake. At first we were a bit disappointed as the trail was going parallel to a road. A couple warned us that they have seen a mother bear and her cubs. Bear spray ready we just continued talking loudly and clapping our hands. Indeed, after 20 minutes we saw the bear and one of the small ones next to her standing approx. 25 meters on the hillside away. We continued with beating hearts - nevertheless what an amazing experience! The trail winds around the lake and we were glad to have our hiking poles with us when we came across a stretch where there was still quite a lot of snow. Later on we came across some dear, marmots and cute chipmunks and another moose just 10 meters away from us. The whole hike around the lake takes approx. 4 1/2 hours but is easy as there is nearly no elevation change. There is also a possibility to take boots across the lake to shorten the hike. Though we found the noise from the boat motor a bit disturbing.Grand Teton has a breath-taking scenery, abundant wildlife and seems to be less crowded than e.g. Yellowstone.","June 8, 2014",Jenny Lake Loop Trail - Amazing beauty and wildlife,13,"Bern, Switzerland",5

We saw a moose, bedded down in some brush. I wonder what he was thinking when a bus stopped and 20 people got out to look at him while he napped. Ha! Ha! He was HUGE with a face only a mother could love. ;)The mountains are nothing short of amazing - the sheer size and stature of them make you marvel at nature in all her glory. Our guide showed us where people had climbed to the top of the tetons and we thought his joke about how many was funny. He said the explorers who named the park must have had too much to drink as there are 3 mountains!! (Teton means breast in French.)While photos do not do this place justice, we took them anyway. Ansel Adams, the famous photographer, took many here and you can see why it was a favorite source of inspiration. We took a few photos in the exact spot he did for fun.We saw some lakes were people were swimming and kids were playing.

Grand Teton,"In my opinion, Grand Teton is often overlooked by the Yellowstone visitors. But this is exactly what makes Grand Teton National Park even better. I have visited both Yellowstone and Grand Teton. I usually only spend one day in Yellowstone and five days in Grand Teton. Why? 1. Less crowded. 2. Have always seen more wildlife. 3. Ease of travel around the area. 4. Easy access to remote hiking trails. In Grand Teton you can see the same wildlife as Yellowstone, with a much better chance of seeing the various types of wildlife more than once. Two Ocean Lake is wonderful for a secluded kayaking adventure. The time I kayaked on Two Ocean, we were the only people on the lake. There are also kayaking opportunities on Jenny Lake and Leigh Lake. Anyone who goes to Grand Teton should hike Cascade Canyon. Another wonderful thing about Grand Teton is the amount of really good lodging locations located on private property within or near the park. This gives you the option to stay at bed and breakfasts, rustic cabins and guest ranches right inside the park itself.","March 15, 2014",Best Place To See Wildlife,28,"Fort Worth, Texas",5
Grand Teton,"We recently made a very specific visit to Grand Teton NP. We trekked the Granite Canyon trail on XC skis with a guide. Lucky for us, the trail had already been broken by someone, making it slightly easier for us. The entire loop took about 2 hours, including a full five to ten minutes where I fell in deep snow and it took that long get up. (Humbled!) By the looks of it, only one or two people had preceded us in the fresh snowfall but it was enough to tamp it down slightly and gave us the added advantage to having a trail to follow. Our guide brought bear spray, something I might not have known to do. While there were no bears, we did see FRESH bear tracks, unusual in late January I gather, but there they were, demonstrating that the bear spray wasn't just a superfluous splurge. The trail was lovely, winding uphill (sometimes it seems that everything is always uphill) through forest, over streams and aspen groves. There are many other trails and trailheads; we only had time to explore one. The mountains ringing the distant views were constantly changing in the light, clouds and snow. It was quiet, beautiful and perfect.Since we were true newbies there, our guide was indispensable; we learned what all the animal tracks were (came in handy during the rest of the week) and also the types of trees and assorted history. Restaurant verification ad recommendations, too. And, of course, that bear spray.","March 2, 2014","Majestic Mountains, Deep Tall Woods, Burbling Streams",190,"Farmington, Connecticut",5
Grand Teton,"I've heard many people say that Grand Teton is better than Yellowstone for wildlife, and this may well be true.We had limited time in the parks, and the lure of the Geysers meant that Yellowstone was our priority, but we spent most of a day in Grand Teton. We didn't get to see much wildlife, but the scenery was spectacular.

It was about 20 degrees, with 40 mph winds, and snow. We still went and it was awesome! Beautiful and serene. The ranger (Ann? She was from Houston and I forgot her name!) was great! We used actual snowshoes from 1943 when they were scouting the park. We learned about the different park animals and snow (our 14 year old loved it!).

It does not matter what season of the year you visit, the beauty and magnificence of nature will be right there. My husband and I visited Grand Teton in late October 2013. We experienced fall and winter in two consecutive days. The Visitors Center has a very nice movie that explains the geologic origins and changes of the area, and a very nice store. Please note that by mid October all the lodges and restroom facilities throughout the park close until the spring. Only a private restaurant and some shops are open. Some roads become too dangerous during the winter and are closed by the park police. Whether you are a professional or amateur photographer, take your time stopping at the different outlooks.

Grand Teton,We spent two months touring the West Coast of America recently and we are glad that we took the time to visit Grand Teton. It is a very attractive park with lots of wild life and a must see and well worth the drive from Salt Lake City. We had a lovely camping spot just beside Jackson Lake and it was wonderful being able to see the stars at night from the camp site. There are many pleasant walks around the park and the walk to Jenny and Taggart Lakes is very attractive. As we visited several national parks on our trip we found it useful to purchase the annual pass to get into the parks because it is more convenient and a saving in costs overall.,"November 1, 2013",Worth the trip,62,"Auckland, New Zealand",5
Grand Teton,"From the sparkling blue waters the Tetons rise from the lakeshore to touch the clouds. The Fall colours are wonderful and the Glaciers still cling to the mountain side in sheltered gulleys which all makes for spectacular viewing. A stroll along the lake, a boat trip across it and a drive up Signal mountain for spectacular panoramic views are just some of the options you have to enjoy along with the views. We found it easy to find quiet spots along the lakeshore just to sit and breath in the air and surroundings, it was so peaceful you could not help but feel the 'inner calm' wash over you.

Grand Teton,"This park is well worth your visit, even if you have to drive 6 hours from Salt Lake City International Airport. I went in August when the weather was still warm and the skies as blue as the finest turquoise. It's $25 per vehicle for a week pass to the park (includes entry to Yosemite) and many of the top attractions are only within a few miles.I loved Jenny Lake, and the hike around the lake from the Visitor's Center to Hidden Falls is well worth the time and effort--and risk of encountering a bear. Rich conifer forest and well-worn trails take you higher and higher as you go, with a spectacular view of the lake as you near the falls. Watch your step in some areas as there's a steep dropoff.Another favorite is Phelps Lake, easily accessible near the Jackson Hole entrance, but also along the narrow, windy park entry road from Teton Village. A 4-mile roundtrip is all it takes. It's not as far as it seems and the peace and serenity of just gazing at the lake does more for your mental health than anything I've ever experienced. The John Moulton Barn with its Grant Teton backdrop is probably one of the most photographed scenes in the U.S., if not the world. Though the barn is not lived in, you almost want to move in here so you can continue to feel the exhilaration for the rest of your life. If you're lucky, you'll get a chance to see grizzly bears, black bears, moose, elk, bighorn sheep and mule deer as you drive the John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway, which leads through the park on up to Yellowstone.Truly, there's so much breathtaking scenery here that I could go on for days. You also should spend time in Teton Village (to the east) and Jackson (to the south).

As many pictures as you take they never can replicate the feeling of standing in front of those mountains.

We spotted nothing at Antelope Flats, one lonely moose near the campground, and were heading the last area thinking, oh well, maybe next time. First we spotted the herd but it was far away from the highway, so we took Wolff Ranch Road to get closer. Along the way we were treated to two dozen+ pronghorn antelope, then noticed that the herd was crossing the road from over the hill into the big meadow. Worth every minute! Evidently this time of year the bison hang out there as the next day we once again saw them, this time alongside the main highway near Wolff Ranch Rd. again.

Grand Teton,"On a recent road trip, we drove through most of Wyoming. I have to say that most of the state can best be described as desolate, mostly uninhabited and not very welcoming for a road-weary traveler. Shortly after leaving Jackson, however, we arrived at Grand Tetons National Park. What an amazing place. Majestic, breath-taking, and awe-inspiring are certainly appropriate descriptors but they fall short of expressing just how incredibly this place is. In addition to the ""GRAND"" mountains and natural scenery, the wildlife was abundant and such a treat to see in the wild. We felt like we were truly given a refreshing respite after hours and hours and hours of driving through ""nothingness."" Truly an oasis for us. I will definitely be back!","September 4, 2013",A-MAZE-ZING!,1,Seguin,5

Early one morning as we were traveling to Yellowstone, the amazing sight of the Tetons was breathtaking, and the herds of bison, moose and antelope. The view of Jackson Hole and the Snake River from the top of the Tetons was a sight to behold. Haven't experienced anything like it. I believe I enjoyed exploring Teton National Park more than Yellowstone.","September 4, 2013",Amazing!!,5,Maryland,5

We were so happy to spend 2 days in the area and wished we could stay longer. There is plenty to do -We started each day at the lodge watching the local wildlife start their day on the plain. We floated on the Snake River and were treated to a moose and her calf on the water's edge.

Grand Teton,"I'm here in mid-August, and there still weren't too may people. Almost half were not Americans either. Why are we missing out on this place?? For viewing, go to 'Jenny Lake' first. Then try Jackson Lake. Try a boat rental on either if you can. No really. Think you can't do that? It's so easy and the tour guides will easily take 5 minutes to show you the way to do it. You'll then be hooked, though.PS. Outboard boat rentals? In Glacier NP, I was showed the ropes for a couple of minutes, and know how to do something I never thought I wish I knew how to do. Cost $25/hour there. Great deal . Learning to use a Moped would be harder.Jackson Lake is larger, but the views won't be quite as good as Jenny Lake. They may have more boating opportunities though, while still having great views.Of what I've seen, and we tried most USA West vistas, this is up there with a few top places here. Like Zion/Bryce, Globe-Showlow (AZ), Glacier NP's 'Going to the Sun road"", Grand Canyon/Royal Gorge (seen from the Bottom/river, via raft, rail, or mule), Silverton-Ouray (CO) narrow gauge rail or drive, and there are many more.","August 18, 2013","Excellent Park.

Grand Teton,"We spent a week hiking the Tetons, and loved every minute. We stayed at a condo in the Aspenwood complex near Jackson Hole ski area- and it was more convenient to most of the hiking than the town of Jackson Hole. We are in our mid 60's but in very good physical shape and we were able to enjoy most of the hiking labeled easy to moderate. Best tip is to NOT be afraid of hikes label difficult, as the first hour or so of these hikes is across beautiful terrain with marvelous views. Once you get to the base of the Tetons, tackling the ravines is for a different class of hiker than we are :) There are two very good ranger stations that can provide maps, advice, and some good orientation movies. Would advise packing lunch and LOTS of water - there are few places to buy provisions, and the altitude really dehydrates you more quickly that we generally experience. Early/mid June had beautiful weather, and not too many people yet - a good time to come.","August 15, 2013",Nature at its Best,74,"New Smyrna Beach, Florida",5
Grand Teton,This National Park is such a treasure! The views and wildlife are amazing and there are so many great trails available for hikers of all ages and abilities.

The round-trip hike was moderate and probably about 4 miles round-trip. Perfect family hike!,"August 15, 2013",Spectacular!,99,"Mount Pleasant, South Carolina",5

Grand Teton,"After three days in Yellowstone, we headed to the Grand Teton Natl. Park and started seeing the real beauty and wildlife. It was less crowded (Though Jackson Wyoming was very crowded). We saw moose here, lots of elk, and generally more wildlife than we saw in Yellowstone. We found this to have better visitor centers than Yellowstone, better roads, and better scenery. And the scenery was amazing. Moose can be seen early morning along the Gros Ventre river northwest of the Gros Ventre Junction. I'm sure they are other places, but that is where we saw them. We found the Morman row to be very picturesque. We also loved the amazing Craig Thompson visitor center at Moose. You have to go there for sure. When you go to a visitor center, ask them for the driving tour. It is well worth it to get their suggestions. One place we almost didn't go to was the chapel of the transfiguration. We found that to be beautiful. I strongly recommend this park. The mountains are unlike any I've ever seen.","August 14, 2013",Intoxicating Beauty,57,"Rochester, Minnesota",5

While at GTNP, we decided to add another day to our trip. We found a hotel in Dubois, WY, which is about 1hr. from the park. Besides capturing amazing scenes with our camera, canoeing on Lake Jackson was the highlight of our short time in GTNP. The Marina at the visitor center rents canoes and kayaks. Because of the little traffic in GTNP, compared with the heavy traffic at Yellowstone, we decided that when we return to these parks, we will camp at GTNP.","August 5, 2013",Photography and Adventure,210,"Waxahachie, Texas",5

The scenic overlooks are great - each one you stop at boasts another breathtaking panorama. It's unlike anything I have ever seen! I think my favorite overlook was the Cascade Canyon one.

Grand Teton,"We visited the Grand Tetons as part of a 13-night Globus bus tour from Rapid City to Las Vegas. Before the trip, everyone I know who had seen the Tetons had raved about their unbelievable beauty and majesty, and so I had high expectations going in and was not the least bit disappointed. The youngest of the Rocky Mountain chain, the Tetons stand out for their glacial, angular peaks still snow-capped in mid-summer laid out before a pair of pristine lakes and the Snake River -- their stark shadows clearly visible in the waters that lie at their feet. We had two very different opportunities to view the Tetons -- from afar and up close at several lookout points and from the Lodge where we enjoyed lunch while on our way to Jackson; and the next morning on a float trip along the Snake River. Visiting the Tetons, even in these ways, did not grow tiring; it was hard to take your eyes off these majestic mountains and cast them elsewhere.There's only a couple of places to stay or eat in the Park itself; with close proximity to Jackson, it's probably best to stay there and spend time in the Grand Teton National Park as a day trip or two.","August 2, 2013","...""Purple Mountain's Majesty...""",32,"Millsboro, Delaware",5

Take the Wilson- Moose road at dusk for a chance to see these animals, Bear also sighted in the same area.

We saw wildlife and were alone for most of the hike. All of the trails are clearly marked, and you are really out in the wild, which is what we wanted. We heard about Jenny Lake, but for us that was just too crowded. You don't have to hike for 6 hours like we did, and can make it a shorter hike if you want.

Grand Teton,"We are 2 adults, 2 kids, 10 and 11. We visited Grand Teton NP, Jackson Hole, WY and found a place for $100/nt at the Hostel in Teton Village, saved alot by staying there. We arranged to eat our breakfast at the hostel (an old ski lodge-from Olympic trials or? .. it seems), and ate dinner we prepared there. Saved alot of money, saw incredible animals, did alot of hiking, went to top of Jackson Hole Ski Resort (a little spendy but well worth it). the Hostel was pretty sparse, it had small bathrooms, the rooms were narrow, dark, with only one window, might be some dust in the corners, no desks or swimming pool here, but they were comfy. It had bunk beds, the floors creak --creaks alot, a large rec room in basement with a large frig for all to keep their groceries (all were labelled) and rec room included a toaster, a microwave, lots of tables and a tv, a ping pong table, and more games that i can imagine, a table just for checkers and chess. OK..it wasn't the Marriott, but neither were the prices. Alot of younger college age kids working at the place, my kids made friends with some at the front desk, and they liked their dog Cinch. I saw quite a few families, and older couples who look like they were in good shape and maybe retired but saving money while visiting the area, also saw plenty of Foreigners who know how to stay in hostels. Grand Teton NP is just up the road from the hostel, as well as Jackson Hole which has a cute historic downtown- our kids did a stagecoach ride, short and sweet for $4/each, and check out the Million Dollar Cowboy Bar, too. We did alot of hiking in Grand Teton, ate lots of PBnJ sandwiches, baby carrots, string cheese, beefsticks, and always brought our own water bottles.

Grand Teton,"Grand Teton had been on my list of parks I wanted to visit for a long time. I am so happy we included it in our trip to Wyoming. It is a fairly small park, so you can see and do much of the park in a visit of a few days. Except for the hike to Hidden Falls, which you can get to by boat, so it attracts a lot of people, most of the trails were very quiet and we saw few other people. We stayed in Teton Village just outside the ""back"" entrance to the park, so we were able to get into the park very quickly. Great hikes, beautiful scenery and lots of animals--elk, deer, moose. We saw several beaver dams, but no beavers.","July 16, 2013",Don't miss this park,60,"Madison, Wisconsin",5
Grand Teton,"We visited the National Park and the Grand Tetons cannot be adequately described or shown in pictures. It is truly stunning. From the first view of the mountain range visitors will be impressed with the beauty of the place. We took the ferry at Jenny Lake across to the Jenny Lake trail head. We then hiked up to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point. Those are .5 and 1.0 miles from the ferry landing respectively. The trail was pretty busy all the way up. Once we were past Inspiration Point the number of hikers dropped of to very few. We proceeded all the way up Cascade Canyon to the crossing and then took the trail toward Lake Solitude. Due to the lateness of the day we only got about a mile up that trail (just past the tree line) before we needed to turn back to catch the last ferry back across the lake. Our total distance was just about 11 miles. The ferry is $16 per person and if I recall a good bit less for seniors. Veterans can take it at no charge. The last ferry is at 7pm but if you miss it you can hike the trail around Lake Jenny which will add 2 miles to your total hiking for the day.The views were spectacular. The trail ranges between moderate and strenuous; with most of it being moderate in terms of difficulty. Along the way we saw moose, deer and marmots and fortunately no bear; although we saw bear scat on the trail. Hiking in the Tetons is quite safe provided you have good boots, lots of water and carry bear spray with you. Bear spray is an absolute necessity. It runs about $40 for a canister, which may seem expensive until you stumble upon a grizzly or black bear. Then it can seem pretty cheap! Bear encounters are pretty rare but if you are one of those rare occurrences you will be glad that you have it. Traveling in a group is also a great idea because the noise of several folks can spook a bear out of the way. I wouldn't hike alone in the Tetons (or Yellowstone for that matter). Seeing the Tetons from the base on the east side or west side is quite impressive. Hiking up for a closer view is and experience that is rewarding for first time or many time visitors. If you love the outdoors, impressive natural views, running mountain streams, wildlife and nourishment for your soul, the Grand Tetons are for you!","July 15, 2013",Awesome View and Fun,92,"Newnan, Georgia",5

Grand Teton,"Since we were staying at West Yellowstone we thought it would be great to take a full day and travel the 42 mile loop in the Grande Tetons and as much else as we could fit into a day. It was about 3 and 1/2 hours to Jackson where we entered the park at Moose and traveled a rough road a few miles until we it turned to pavement. Stopped at the Visitors and then headed up the Grand Teton Park Road stopping at Jenny Lake, Signal Mtn,and Willow Flats. By this time it was clear the loop would have to wait for another day and we continued on to Colter Bay and then to the south entrance to Yellowstone. Nine hours well spent in a most beautiful National Park which is very different from Yellowstone. I would recommend others who plan a similar trip to stay over a night and break the trip up over two days. We stopped and took pictures at all of the turnouts, so that added to the time.

Grand Teton,"We were in the Grand Teton National Park for four nights after our 8 night trip to Yellowstone. We loved it. It was beautiful. We were there from June 26th to June 30th and the wild flowers were in abundance.I want to thank BlueBirdDay and PeachBelle for all their suggestions and the help they gave me to plan our trip to the Tetons. The rugged mountain range was beautiful. We followed the Park Map supplied by the Grand Teton National Park Service and covered most of the sites pointed on the map. Stayed at the Signal Mountain Lodge for 4 nights. 1st day took a drive to the Signal Mountain Summit. It was a beautiful drive with good lookout points and the top of the summit was beautiful with wild flowers in abundance. Drove on the main road south towards Jenny Lake and took the one way road to Jenny Lake overlook and then to the Jenny Lake visitor center. Parking was full. Had to change plans. Drove to Laurance Rockefeller Preserve. Waited not too long to get a parking spot and hiked to Phelps Lake.Unfortunately weather turned out to be in the mid 80's and it was just a little warm for the hike. Also visited Craig Thomas Discovery and Visitor Center.2nd day got early to Jenny Lake Visitor Center and took the boat across Jenny Lake and hiked up to the Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point and covered some of the points of interest on the Park Map.3rd day took a hike to Taggart Lake, beautiful place with the Teton Range in the background. The trail was not too crowded as we went early being worried that we would not get a parking place. After the hike went to Teton Village in Jackson and took the tram to the top of Rendezvous mountain. On our way saw a glimpse of a moose. It was worth the trip even though the ticket was a little pricey. $26.00 per person. Views were amazing. We had waffles at Corbet's Cabin. They were yummy with butter and brown sugar in between. Visited Jackson Lake Lodge and viewed the Lake from their Mural Room. We also had great views of Jackson Lake from the Signal Mountain Lodge.Had a great 4 night stay in the Tetons. The day we left we had a beautiful view from the Oxbow Bend Turnout. It is a beautiful place for photo opportunities with the reflection of the Tetons in the Snake River. Snake River Overlook is also a good place to take pictures. Took a drive over Antelope Flats road and took some photos of the Mormon Row and took the loop to Kelly and got back on the main road. Plenty of wildflowers. A few bison.","July 3, 2013",Beautiful and breathtaking,75,United States,5
Grand Teton,"We spent 2-3 driving through the park and found it difficult to spot wildlife. We did finally encounter the moose several times, both mom, calves and bull moose. The scenery is gorgeous with the mountains. 2 days in the park is plenty of time is you are just driving around and seeing wildlife.

It is smaller than Yellowstone, but it still packs a punch for activities and hiking. Your Yellowstone pass will get you into the Tetons for free. Be sure to see Jenny Lake, Inspiration Point, and Lake Taggart. If you are more of a hiking enthusiast, Amphitheater Lake will leave you breathless (literally). You have a 3,500 feet change of elevation in about 4 miles. Keep going because the pay off is worth it. Be warne that the trail will be covered with snow in higher elevations even into mid June.

Grand Teton,"I travelled to Jackson, Wyoming to do some real hiking and bond-building with my 15 yr old son. We do some hiking back home in NC, but were looking for something a little more challenging. We found that and lots more! We started with a moderate hike around Jenny Lake and up to Hidden Falls and Inspiration. Immediately, we knew we were onto something special - the hike around Jenny Lake was beautiful - and then the Falls and Inspiration Point were amazing. The next day we decided to try a tougher hike - and so we selected the Garnet Canyon trail starting at Lupine Meadows Trailhead. The hike starts with mountain meadows in full bloom and keeps getting more rugged and beautiful the further you go. It is a strenuous hike, climbing over 2000 feet. About 2/3 of the way to Garnet Creek, you round a corner and are awestruck by the view of Middle Teton (see attached photo). We continued up to the creek crossing - and somewhere around 9000 feet we ran into snow and couldn't go further. We did some free rock climbing, took lots of pictures, had a well-deserved snack, and then started back down the mountain. It's definitely easier going back down! Overall, the hike was about 5-6 hrs and about 8.5 miles roundtrip.For our last hike, we decided to hike up into Death Canyon. This was also a very beautiful hike, along the way you get a great view of Phelps Lake. One bad thing is that after climbing about 500 ft, the trail goes back down towards the lake (dropping over 500 ft) before turning back upwards towards the mountains. It's tough to ""give up"" that hard earned altitude - but if you press on, it is worth it. About halfway up, the trail meets up with Death Canyon Creek and then follows the creek all the way up the valley. At around 8500 feet, the terrain flattens out (for awhile) and there is a ranger cabin and some flat water. From here, you can hike onwards higher up the canyon, but we decided to turn back. The walk back again was alot easier, but this time, there was some ""unexpected"" uphill - which just seemed wrong for the return trip! Overall, another great hike of about 6 hours and almost 8 miles.We initially thought about taking the Jackson Hole Tram up to the top and hiking down Granite Canyon, but there was still too much snow at the top and so we decided not to press our luck. Later in the year, I suspect this would be a terrific route of something like 10+ miles (but mostly downhill) with duration 6-7 hours.There are lots of traile we never made it too - and so we hope to make it back to explore those... but for the trails we did see, we rate GTNP a superstar!","June 27, 2013",More stunning around every next turn,7,"Cary, NC",5
Grand Teton,"We really loved our hike around the North end of Jenny Lake, up to Inspiration Point and on into Cascade Canyon. I recommend parking at the String Lake lot and hiking the North end if you prefer a less crowded hike. The parking lot is small, so I would get there early! We spent over 6 hours and hiked about 11 miles, taking frequent breaks and stopping for lunch. We had Bear spray, but never saw any bear, tho I have heard they are more abundant in July and August when the berries are ripe. We saw lots of marmots, a fisher, osprey and deer. The hike was not very difficult, tho the climb to Inspiration Point is a bit steep, but well worth it! We started very early in the morning and had only a few other hikers, but in the afternoon, it got crowded by the Ferry for the South end of Jenny Lake. There are many breath taking hikes in the Tetons! Cascade Canyon is relatively flat, following a stream between the Tetons, it is very beautiful, and you can go as far as you want, we only went a few miles before turning around.","June 26, 2013","Jenny Lake, Inspiration Point and Cascade Canyon",22,"White Bear Lake, Minnesota",5

Traveling through the park north on Hwy 191/26/89 there are various turnouts for views and picture taking.  When you reach Moran junction turn left to continue north on Hwy 89/191/287 passing Jackson Lake. Before reaching Jackson Lake Lodge you may want to take a short detour to Signal Mountain for great 360 degree views of the valley. Then you may grab a bite at the Jackson Lake Lodge if you wish. A bit further on at Colter Bay Village, there is an Indian Arts Museum. You can return by taking the road to the left to pass Jenny Lake stopping at the many turnouts for views of the Teton Range. Be alert for wildlife such as moose, elk, and pronghorns. Also you will see many water fowl by the lakes.The Jenny Lake Lodge is another great place to grab a meal. In fact, it's my favorite lodge in the park.The scenery in the park changes as you change your elevation.Most hikes in the park are all day or half day hikes.

Grand Teton,"Grand Teton National Park is named after the tallest mountain in the Teton Range located at the northeastern edge of the Rockies. The jagged snow-capped peaks and their reflections on pristine alpine lakes are the principal features of the park. Add to that vast wilderness and abundant wildlife; you get a heavenly feeling all through your stay. True to our expectations, we were blessed by countless interactions with permanent residents of the park, namely bears, elks, bisons, mooses, deers and antelopes.The mesmerizing beauty of the shimmering waters of Jackson Lake was enhanced by its awesome backdrop, a cutout of a portion of the Teton Range. Snake River, which enriches the biodiversity of the park, can be best explored along the scenic Grassy Lake Road. Being a dirt road, this is not so popular among tourists, but offers serene sunset view along the Glade Creek.The other popular scenic drive around the south of Jackson Lake leads to the top of Signal Mountain, which tenders 360° panoramic views of the four mountain ranges: the Tetons, Gros Ventres, Wind Rivers, and Absarokas.Oxbow Bend and Blacktail Ponds Overlook are the best bet to watch a number of wildlife. Pronghorn antelopes were abundant in the nearby Antelope Flats Road and the Mormon Row dirt road.Teton Village is located just outside the park boundaries and offers a spectacular ride on an aerial tramway to the summit of Rendezvous Peak. The view from the top, to say it mildly, was captivating.","March 14, 2013",Gateway to Tetons,73,"Boston, Massachusetts",5

There was a rain storm off in the distance when we came in, and it was just beautiful. If we were back in this area again, I would try to spend some more time here just looking at all the natural beauty of the whole area. We really did not think it would be a big deal after exploring Yellowstone for 4-5 days, but it was just a mesmerizing experience. We did manage to stop at two visitor's centers and enjoyed those very much, but just taking in the area is a serene experience that you have to check out if you are anywhere close. Even just driving by was amazing. Neither words or pictures can describe it, but I am adding a few pictures and noting that they definitely do not do this area justice. I can't imagine what exploring the area would be like, but I do plan to do just that at some point in the future if I am able. Just amazing!!!","February 23, 2013",Wow.

When you view the Tetons they look unreal because they just rise straight out of the prairie. We saw moose both male and female, beaver colony and dam, Prong Horn Deer, Byson and many other types of wild animals. We did a private 4 hour wild life tour in the Tetons, it was absolutely awesome.

Grand Teton,"I don't know how to describe Grand Teton National Park. Most parts of the park were shut down. But nature works its mysteries 24/7. And they did for us. One day, we took the northern loop drive, from Jackson Junction (I think), going west and then south to the visitor center and Moose. The weather was threatening and it did rain at times. Some of the mountain areas were visible, much was not, and when we took some side roads, the rain and wind continued to make the visibility poor. Still, we continued and we finally returned to our accommodation - and then experienced a thunder and lightening storm, hail, rain and slush - and had about two inches of slush on our windshield!!Then came the next day. The sky was bright blue, and the mountains were glorious with newly-fallen snow. We repeated the journey of the day before, then continued, at Moose, down on the road to Teton Village ski center. This time, the mountains glowed in all their glory. I think Mount Moran was special, but the most spectaular peak, to me, was Grand Teton, approaching from the norhtwest. Shadows made it possible to see the ""horns"" - spires and cliffs that somehow are not seen from the typical views looking from east-to-west. There is something about the side hidden them, the north or northeast side, that has the unearthly appearance of parts of Torres del Paine, in southern Chile. The spires and jagged edges in of Grand Teton certainly, to me, make this a unique mountain in the Lower 48 states.","October 27, 2012",How can you Describe It?,95,"San Jose, CA",5

Grand Teton,"My husband and I spent a week in Jackson Hole, WY and thoroughly enjoyed meandering through the park each day we were there. If you visit, make sure you drive the Moose-Wilson road to see wildlife! There are many pullouts and places to hike. On a gorgeous, sunny day we hiked to Phelps Lake Overlook - a beautiful vista! On another day, we hiked to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point. It was overcast and drizzled for most of the hike, but we had fun anyway. (If you visit in the off season like we did when the ferry is not running across Jenny Lake, drive down the Lupine Meadows trailhead and take the boat launch turnoff and you can cut off some of the walking distance from the South Jenny Lake parking area.) The week we visited the park, we saw moose, bear, elk, deer, and pronghorn. Although the fall folliage wasn't at its peak, there was still color and it was beautiful! If you go, make sure you visit Jackson Lake, Oxbow Bend, Jenny Lake, Signal Mountain and Mormon Row. While we were there, the weather ranged from sunny to overcast to rain. BUT although it rained in the valley, we discovered snow on the mountaintops! The crowds were light since it was the off season and some of the attractions had shut down on Oct 1, but we preferred this time of year over the crowds of summertime. If you love clear blue sky with white puffy clouds that look suspended in air and wide open spaces, then this is the place for you!","October 18, 2012",Absolutely breathtaking!!!,63,"Goose Creek, SC",5

It was a cool and rainy with some snow showers, which is typical for May. The mountains were snow covered and just beautiful. Hiking can only be done in the valleys due to snow cover. We saw elk and bision calves. The fall is also very nice. The weather is usually sunny and cool. We just missed peak fall folliage, which is about the 3 rd week of Sept. The animals were active and in rut. The crowds were not bad, but more crowded than spring. Lodging is cheaper in the off seasons, but many of the lodges were closed. All roads were open in the fall, in the spring, the road to Signal mountain was still closed. Anytime if year would be an amazing time to visit!! Of course Yellowstone is just to north and also a definite 5 rating!! If you love the outdoors, and want to see one of the most beautiful places on earth, do not skip the Tetons!!

The Tetons are pretty spectatular, and the main visitor center (near moose junction) is truly a must see for all. We watched a movie there that made us appreciate what we were seeing more. There are also some nice chances to view wildlife, depending on the season and time of day (if you want to see moose, you evidently need to get out there pretty early). If you are trying to visit Yellowstone and the Tetons just to sight see, and want to base out of one hotel, I would recommend getting one in West Yellowstone. You are then only 3 minutes out of Yellowstone, and maybe 50 minutes out of the Tetons.","October 8, 2012",Nice Park,222,"Inverness, Florida",4

Within 20 minutes of our entry into the park on our first day, we saw a bear (within 15 feet of the road and apparently oblivious to us), a bull elk, and a bull moose. More elk and moose 'posed' for our cameras in other visits. And the scenery! Lakes so clear that even on a hazy day, the abutting forests shimmered in reflection in their waters. Forests and meadows. And of course, those mountains. Whether dark and brooding in the dusk or rising and triumphant in the morning sun, they inspire awe.

We walked several of the easier trails, Phelps Lake, Jenny Lake and visited the National Museum of Wildlife Art. All highly recommended, saw moose in the river, a golden eagle, a bald eagle and several osprey. I'd love to go back there one day. When we were arranging our trip to Grand Teton and Yellowstone an american travel 'expert' recommended at least two days in Yellowstone, and a day in Grand Teton...we spent four days in Grand Teton, which was probably about right, and eight days in Yellowstone.

When I arrived, there were wildfires in Idaho dumping smoke into the Park from the West, and the Grand Teton Mountains were barely visible. The next day the smoke was less, the day after even less. When they finally appeared, nothing could prepare me for their impact. The Grand Tetons are a fairly young range, still stark and craggy. They rise swiftly from the valley floor and top out at over 13,000 feet (I believe that is 3,939 meters if my math is correct).. The Park has abundant wildlife viewable from the road, or during hikes off-road. You can rent a boat and fish for lake trout, or several other species of trout. Fly fishing is very popular in the Snake River both in Grand Teton Park and on the Snake River to the south of Jackson, Wyoming. I took a gided hike with a Park Ranger to Inspiration Point and had a wonderful time, and was rewarded with an absolutely beautifull view of Jenny Lake when we arrived at that point. The Park is fairly big, and there is lots to see. My recommendation is that you spend several days there in order to enjoy your experience.

Next time, we will be sure to add the Canyon trail to our hike, as everyone said it was incredibly scenic.","August 25, 2012",A wonderful place to relax and enjoy Americana,5,"Portland, Oregon, United States",5
Grand Teton,"I spent a few days with my family exploring this spectacular park. Anyone silently standing at the foot of these magnificient rocky peaks will fall in a state of contemplation, a sense of humbleness in the presence of giants. For the sporty ones, there are superb cycling paths (paved), and for the walkers quite an array of hiking trails. Be prepared to dodge often though, because horses have left behind an impressive amount of dung in the trails (not cool). I must say that my hikes, although benefical for my personnal health, did not permit me to develop more awe than from the car windows. In Yellowstone, one MUST walk to see the best of the geysers, but this seems not to be the case in GT. The best points of interest CAN be seen from the road, or short hikes.","August 24, 2012","Spectacular vues, not so good trails",168,"Annapolis, Maryland",5

Grand Teton,"May be it was just our bad luck -- but we came here to get some fresh air and cool alpine scenery - and were met by hot dry weather with air quality worse than san fernando valley, thanks to idaho wildfires. overall the place is ok to drive around for a day or two -- but yellowstone a lot more scenic in my opinion, and better from a wildlife perspective as well. this area seems more like a rich winter playground, along the lines of vail, etc. ","August 19, 2012",Prefer Yellowstone over this one,15,"Los Angeles, California",3
Grand Teton,"I recently did a 3 night backpack trip at the Grand Tetons National Park. I parked at the Leigh Lake Trailhead and hiked up the Paintbrush Canyon Trail the first day. A challenging but worthwhile hike. I saw a big black bear midway up the canyon eating in a raspberry field next to the trail. I set up camp just below the end of the upper paintbrush camp zone. A beautiful view all around. The next day, I went over the Paintbrush divide and also summited the peak to the north of the divide. 10820 ft. Great view and easy climb. Then down to Lake Solitude. This area is full of flowers and the lake is wonderful. I continued down and saw the largest moose I have every saw. It had 8 points but another 10-12 points that were about to complete. A sight. The South fork Cascade was fully of waterfalls and cliffs. Going to the end and climbing Hurricane Pass is well worth it to see the perfect view of the 3 Tetons and the valley where the South Fork Trail runs. I stayed two days in this area. Well work it. Lastly, I hiked down early the last morning down Cascade Trail. A very easy slow decline. I will go back.","August 18, 2012",Utmost Beauty with a good challenging hike,60,"Austin, Texas",5

Grand Teton,"Even if you're not doing serious backpacking, the mountain vistas are fabulous from so many vantage points and perspectives. Some of ours included from a very early morning float trip on the Snake River. We saw bald eagles on that float trip also. Views from Blacktail POnds Overlook and Schwabacher's landing also gorgeous. Several short hikes are also pretty accessible. We saw plenty of moose near moose junction. Surprisingly, we saw no elk or bison, though we saw plenty of bison in Yellowstone, as well as a bear. I would recommend doing both parks in one trip - we've done that twice. Our grandkids participated in the Junior Ranger program, and it definitely enhanced their experience, I think they learned a lot about both Parks, and begain to develop a real appreciation for them.","August 17, 2012",Grand Teton National Park,32,"Cleveland, Ohio",5

We saw several moose, a grizzly and lots of bison in our short 2 days there. Make sure you catch sunrise at the mormon row barns and at the Snake river overlook. These are the two best spots to be at that time and it's the best time to photograph these beautiful mountains. The inspiration point trail is well worth the trek and don't miss the taggert lake trail too.

Grand Teton,In planning my trip to Grand Teton National Park I had scheduled and paid for a dinner lake cruise on Jackson Lake. The first day at Jackson Lake Lodge I check in and picked up my tickets and was told to be at Jenna Lake at 5:15 PM on the day of the cruise. I received a cell phone call the day of the cruise and was told that they had overbooked the cruise and they would have to cancel my reservations. Needless to say I was very upset. My activity tickets had printed on them that they had a 72 hour cancellation policy if I had wanted to cancel. Obviously Grand Teton Lodge Company does not have to adhere to their own rules.Be aware that booking far in advance does not guarantee you a seat on the dinner cruise,"August 4, 2012",Don't assume that your reservations for dinner cruise on Jackson Lake will result in you taking the cruise.,20,"Aiken, South Carolina",5

We stayed a few nights in the Colter Bay campground (be sure to get there early in the day to secure a spot!). We also backcountry camped one night on the Paintbrush trail, which involved trekking across glaciers, which were incredible to see in July. We hiked to Inspiration Point and through Cascade Canyon, which was absolutely stunning. We white-water rafted the Snake River, made stops for grub at Snake River Brewery (LOVE Pako's Beer) and the Bunnery in Jackson Hole, and kayaked Jackson Lake out of the Colter Bay Marina.

We also did a rafting trip in Jackson and a horseback riding trip through the park (Colter Bay Stables). It has to be one of the most amazing parks I have visited. It needs to be on everyone's list as a must see. We headed up to Yellowstone afterward and I hate to say this, but I thought GTNP was more scenic! We did several ranger programs while we were there and the presenters were passionate about their work and the park. We did not hike as much as I would have liked and it was quite crowded in the end of July, but I would do it all again in a heart beat.

We also had a great hike up to Inspiration Point and took some great pictures.There are an abundant number of Park Rangers to assist if needed. We asked one if he could direct us to a location where we might see a moose. He gave us directions to a place where one had been spotted and he told us how to watch for them. Sure enough, after following his guidance we found her standing in a small pond just as he told us we might.

I also highly recommend getting a guide book or taking a guided tour as roaming on your own, at least the first day, could be counter-productive.

Grand Teton,"GOING TO SOUTH ENTRANCE AND GRAND TETONSHeld up by bison wandering on the road at Alum Creek! After about an hour Lewis Lake pull-in which was very pretty. Then Lewis Falls was difficult to park – roadworks - following the Lewis River and still snow here. Views of the Tetons ahead.Moose Falls – pull-in at Crawfish Creek about 50 yards down a very uneven path to the top of the falls and view into the gorge, then 50 yards of rocky steps down to the bottom for a very close view. 2 mins to the South Entrance from here.We chose to the take the US 191 through Teton National Forest to get a panoramic view of the Grand Tetons. After 20 mins we had our first photos of Jackson Lake with the Tetons in the background. Absolutely beautiful, stunning views again. At the Colter Bay turn-off there are proper toilets and general store first. The Visitor Centre is another 900’ down, but you can park here as well. This was only a small shop, with a couple of Indian ladies with their jewellery and a small display of Indian culture. There was an auditorium, with no sign of times, and a marina.Bear cubs crossing the road sign. I wish! Chance would be the thing. 5 mins down the road there is a pull-in with picture opportunities. Elk Ranch Flats, Snake River Outlook and Glacier View have wonderful views all along the road.About an hour from Colter Bay there is Moose Junction Craig Thomas Discovery & Visitor Centre. This is a new wooden building and well worth a visit. There are lots of exhibits, impressive bronzes, 3 sections of glass floor with videos under your feet.Half an hour on we turned off onto Teton Park Road (Moose-Wilson Rd). Needed to go through the Park Entrance at the base of the Tetons to see Jenny Lake. At Cottonwood Creek here there was a moose with her baby.Jenny Lake is very pretty. It is a 10 min walk down on a paved path. $10 return on a shuttle boat to the other side.Here I consider we made a mistake because we decided to carry on down the Teton Park Road, because the main view from here is obscured by tree covered hills. It is a narrow road with thoughtless drivers coming the other way. About 3 miles and nothing to see until you reach Granite Canyon Trail. There is no stopping for miles. I wished we had gone back to the main road instead because the Tetons are so beautiful, but then we would have to have come back the other longer route.We finally got to Teton Village and Jackson Hole ski resort in about half an hour. Here they operate an aerial tram ride (cable car) to the top of the 10,000+ mountain. This is an absolute ‘must do’ as there are incredible views in a complete panorama, with explanations of what you are looking at. You can see for miles. The cabin holds 60 and runs every 15 mins until 5.30 pm. It was 48F at the top, so need a jacket, but not freezing though, more fresh, but sunny. It boasts the highest ski run in the US. $23 in June, $29 in July. No disabled access.We stayed in Jackson 20 mins away at the Virginian Lodge (see separate review) and ate at the Gun Barrell 2 blocks down.

Grand Teton,"I've just driven past Grand Teton on my way to Yellowstone NP the first two times I was in the area, stopping for a short 10 minutes along the picturesque Jackson Lake. It's not until I started hiking seriously along the Wasatch Front in Utah that I started paying more attention to this smaller, much less famous, yet much more scenic national park, and I soon fell in love with it. Idyllic lakes, plunging waterfalls, rugged mountains, brilliant wild flowers, abundant wild lives, Teton has it all. You can take an easy 1 mile round trip hike, flat, around a beautiful lake; or you can rough it and backpack in to climb to the highest peak; or choose any of the dozens trails in between. With so many lakes, big and small, fishing and boating are good too; but I don't have time for those yet, I'm not quite done hiking!","June 27, 2012",Hiker's Paradise,98,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

Grand Teton,Our experience in the Grand Tetons was great. I read about the area before our trip which was good background material. The park is very user friendly and has something for everyone. The scenery is extraordinary. We spent a couple of days in the area hiking and taking in the scenery. Next time I will have my bike. The bike paths are flat and run parallel to the roads of the parks most of the time. The hiking paths vary in length from1 mile in a paved area to over 15 miles through the mountains .The trails are designated by length and the level of difficulty. We chose a3 mile of medium difficulty through the woods by the falls and then down to the boat dock - you may choose to take the ferry back - IMO good choice. For the photographers the photo opportunities are endless. There are lots of places to pull over so you can get that shot of the mountains or the wildlife. On the second day we hiked in the morning and went for morning shots of Jenny Lake. We worked our way through the park to the north entrance and on to Yellowstone. We did not spend much time in Jackson Hole but it looked very interesting and the downtown is a mecca for shopping. As we drove through one evening there was a native American demonstration in the city park which was drawing a lot of attention.,"June 21, 2012",Awesome experience in Grand Tetons,98,Chicago,5

The views from the Moose Visitor center and from the Jackson Lake Lodge were the best, since it was a nice angle with the flanking mountains in the same photos.

In our FIRST 45 minutes in the park, driving in from Jackson after a long day of travel, we were completely revived by seeing a mother moose and calf, a grizzly bear, a coyote catching and enjoying his dinner and countless bison. The next days did not disappoint. The rangers are knowledgeable and helpful with advise about recommended hikes -- and those NOT recommended due to increased bear activity.

I personally felt the views here are way better than Yellowstone. The feeling of this national park is different from its counterpart up north. It doesn't feel as crowded, yet there were still plenty of people. You'll see plenty of wildlife, yet I didn't get the chance to spot a bear when I was there.

It only takes 1-2 hours to drive from one end of the park to the other depending on how much wildlife you see and how many stops you make to read the signs.

Yellowstone is so crowded, it is more of a drive through and ohh ahh. Animals were out all day, but we have some amazing shows from the Elk around dawn each day. Favorite hike was up to inspiration point at Jenny Lake. A lot of people take the boat but the hike is where it is at! Hidden Falls is a gem, take some time there. The view of the lake is fantastic from the top of inspiration point, we had a great time relaxing up there taking it all in.We were only there 3 days and saw a lot but could have used a little more time.

From here, we tried a double kayak for the first time, took a ranger-led geology walk up to Inspiration Point (must see!!) that began with a ferry ride across Jenny Lake. Don't stop at Inspiration Point, though, because Cascade Canyon trail takes you nearly to the mountain peaks. We took a 6-8-mile hike every day--Bradley and Taggart Lakes, Phelps Lake, String Lake and Two Ocean Lake. Driving up Signal Mountain on our last day in the park gave us our final awe-inspiring experience -- taking in a 360-degree view of where we had just spent our last two weeks -- the Jackson Hole, Snake River, Jackson and Jenny Lakes, and Yellowstone to the north.","January 1, 2012",Awesome vistas from the ground and the mountain tops,19,"Litchfield, Connecticut",5

Grand Teton,"If you are in the Yellowstone area, take the time to see the Tetons. You can enter the park going south from Yellowstone or you can go north from Jackson, Wyoming. I've been to Grand Teton National Park 5 times now and I always stayed in Jackson. It's a very touristy town. You can blow a lot of money there, so be frugal and think ahead.The park is accessed by a Hwy that runs right through the park with incredible views of the Teton peaks. The speed limit is 45 mph and some people push that even higher. If you want to get closer to the base of the Teton mountains, you drive on the Teton Park Road. You must pay an admission fee to drive that road. The Hwy is free to drive.You can access several trails and lakes from the Teton Park Road. Taggart Lake trail is a very popuar trailhead that takes you to a couple of gorgeous lakes - Taggart and Bradley. Jenny Lake is extremely popular. Stop there and pay $20 to take the ferry across the lake for a great hike up to Inspiration Point. In the same area, you can hike around String & Leigh Lakes. String lake was a very fun hike.I highly recommend you take the road up Signal Mountain. It's a great area to view wildlife and you get an incredible view of the mountains and the surrounding area.Further north on Teton Park Road, you can go check out Oxbow Bend for great photo opportunities of Mount Moran and more wildlife viewing, or you can go check out the enormous Jackson Lake. Jackson Lake is well-worth a visit. Take the Lakeshore trail for a pleasant hike with more mountain views. We saw a mule deer right on the trail!On your way back to Jackson, don't forget to take Antelope Flats Road and look for the bison herds. We had a big herd cross the road right in front of our car! Just make sure you give them plenty of space (at least 25 yards) and stay in your vehicle. Pronghorn are also often in that area.Grand Teton is a great national park. It clearly needs to be protected from development, however. This park's history is blemished by repeated attempts to commercialize the area. It's easy to get a sense that there is a pressure from Jackson trying to move north closer to the park. The National Elk Refuge helps prevent that. Let's hope and pray that the National Elk Refuge continues to receive immense support. That is another INCREDIBLE wildlife area, especially in winter.Let's keep Grand Teton a wilderness area! Support those who are working hard to ease the flow in and out of the park without destroying the natural environment. They were building bike paths along the Hwy this year, which is a great idea. Trying to reduce vehicle traffic is paramount. Please drive slow and plan ahead when visiting.

We saw: moose, elk (herds and herds of them), bison (tons of those too), bear, antelope, deer, birds of all kinds, etc. We went into the park many times at different times of the day and saw wild animals every time. Oh and going driving into the park, we were able to see snow. Being from Georgia where we are lucky if we see snow each year let alone in the middle of the summer, we were happy.

Grand Teton,"Twenty-five years ago, one of number-one hits on the Billboard Hot Country Top 100 was a song by Mickey Gilley called “Don’t the Girls All Get Prettier at Closing Time?” If you ask the same question about Grand Teton National Park during late September and early October - when the campgrounds and lodges are shutting down for the winter and a gold and orange carpet of aspens and cottonwoods blankets the banks of the Snake River and the foothills beneath arguably the most distinctive mountain range in America - the answer for many travelers is a resounding “yes!”  It’s not only the Tetons’ towering peaks (a dozen over 12,000 feet in elevation) and luminous leaves that beckon travelers this time of year. There’s rare solitude in places you would least expect it, such as the Snake River Overlook, a popular turnout off Highway 191/26/89. During the summer thousands flock to the spot where Ansel Adams’ shot one of his best-known photos in 1942. On a sunny morning in the first week of October, I had the entire parking lot to myself.  The following day I navigated the narrow, five-mile, corkscrew-shaped road to the summit of Signal Mountain, where the reward for the white-knuckle climb is the most panoramic view in the park - the Tetons, Jackson Lake, and the Snake River meandering across the sprawling valley 800 feet below. There was only one other couple at the observation area.  The window of opportunity for this precious privacy is very short. “The first three weeks of September are [booked] to the wall,” according to Heather Falk, tourism manager for the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce. “The occupancy rate for September is more than 90 percent.”  This includes 6,800 rooms spread out through the 55-mile long Jackson Hole Valley, including Teton Village at the base of Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, properties on the highways leading to the park, and lodging within the park and downtown Jackson, which is 10 miles from the only commercial airport in a U.S. National Park and four miles from the south entrance to the park.  Accommodations are more likely to be available after the annual Jackson Hole Fall Arts Festival from September 8-18 that will attract as many as 15,000 people. An anticipated 500 runners plus friends will be in town for the first Jackson Hole Marathon on September 24, followed by Destination Fall Wellness Week, a local initiative that attracts far fewer visitors than the Fall Arts Festival. Most hotels and motels lower their rates either after the Festival or on October 1. Last year Grand Teton National Park ranked seventh in attendance among the nation’s national parks with nearly 2.7 million visitors. Most of them, however, are gone by the end of September. August attendance soared to nearly 600,000, dipped to 421,830 in September, and dropped to under 150,000 in October.  Fall in the Tetons generally lasts from the beginning of September to mid-October. Temperatures hover between the 60’s and 20’s. If you’re lucky, there will have been sufficient rainfall and cool evening temperatures to create the colorful foliage that historically peaks in the third week of September. The weather, however, is capricious. Last year a sprinkle of snow fell on August 29, but it rarely accumulates much before November. Only 0.5 inches fell in September, 4.4 in October, and 25.2 in November.  In the fall, aroused and sometimes aggressive animals abound in the park during the rutting (breeding) season for the deer species, including the elk and bull moose. In the early evening, you might hear the haunting bugle of a male elk letting females know he’s dominant and available. On occasion, elk will literally lock their huge racks of horns in a skirmish to determine the leading man – an extremely rare and unforgettable sight. With only a few weeks before hibernation, bears in the park are gouging themselves with berries and other sources of food to build the fat that enables them to survive the harsh winter. There are 61 species of mammals found in each of the four major habitats in the park: the alpine, coniferous forests, sagebrush flats, and wetlands. Your odds of undisturbed time with the Grand Teton animal kingdom increase significantly from the end of September to mid-October. My serendipitous moment came when I stumbled upon a small herd of bison off of Antelope Flats Road in an area called Mormon Row, one of the most photographed settings in the park. In the foreground, an abandoned wooden barn from an old Mormon homestead conveniently posed in the tall golden grass poking up through frosted snow. The Cathedral Group, adorned with eight of the highest 10 mountains in the Teton Range, bestowed the breathtaking backdrop.  Had my chance encounter with the bison in the midst of this stunning scenery occurred a month earlier, a horde of rubberneckers likely would have invaded my spot within minutes. However, not a soul was around this time of year! It felt like a private viewing of the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace. I lingered ecstatically, shooting every conceivable angle of my 2,000-pound subjects until they got bored and walked away.  A word of advice, though. It’s best to take pictures of capricious bison from inside your vehicle or very close to it, especially if you are lucky enough to be alone. Their size creates an illusion of sluggish docility, but if riled they can charge at 30 miles per hour, exceedingly faster than you can sprint. This strategy applies to bears, moose, elk, mule deer, pronghorn, or any large species of mammal you might run into. There’s a good reason they’re called wildlife. One of the most spectacular settings in the park for beauty, birds, and beasts is Oxbow Bend, one mile east of Jackson Lake Junction where the Snake River forms a U-shape that looks like the ox collar used by western pioneers. In the summer and early fall, tourists cram the turnout and shoulder of the road to photograph the reflection of 12,605-foot Mt. Moran in the slow-moving water. During autumn, brilliant aspens add another layer of color on the western bank of river. White pelicans, osprey, and on occasion, and bald eagles dive for fish in the shallow water. Moose occasionally roam among the willows. My wife Susan and I soaked in this scene on a late afternoon…by ourselves!  If you’re searching for an exclusive engagement with moose on a scenic road - and don’t mind a bumpy 1.5-mile dirt interruption – try the otherwise paved 15-mile Moose-Wilson Road in the southwest corner of the park. It winds through aspens and across streams near the Snake River between the park headquarters in Moose and Wilson, Wyoming, eight miles outside the park on Route 22. Bear, deer, and other animals also frequent the area, There’s even a Moose Habitat turnout. We watched a pair of moose foraging in the grass and flopping along in a stream.  Only one other couple was there to enjoy the show. That’s what makes Grand Teton National Park so special this time of year.","October 18, 2011",Tetons are Prettier at Closing Time,32,"Prescott, Arizona",5
Grand Teton,"I cannot convey how amazing beautiful and serene Grand Teton National Park is. The airport is located within the park and when we arrived and saw the mountain range while grabbing our suitcases and buffalo wandering through the parking lot it was immediate awe and wonderment - and it only got better. We were lucky enough to see several moose including a day old calf, buffalo, coyotes, bald eagles, elk, mule deer, a black bear, and a grizzly bear with two cubs. I highly recommend taking an Eco tour with Jackson Hole wildlife tours. We went on the sunrise tour and learned so much about the area; we were the only ones on the tour, and our guide stayed with us past the time we were due back because we were lucky enough to find a grizzly with her two cubs. There is so much to see and do in the area and the people in Wyoming are the nicest I have met anywhere. I would happily pick up and move there! I think the beginning of June is the perfect time to go because it was not crowded at all, the weather was lovely even when it snowed (very lightly), and our guides said the wildlife viewing is abundant because the animals move up into the mountains as the weather gets warmer in the summer months. Visit Wyoming - you will not be disappointed!","October 9, 2011",Can't wait to go back!,5,New Jersey,5

We hiked another 20 minutes past Inspiration Point toward the canyon and we were rewarded by seeing a large moose lounging in a shallow waterway. What a magnificant creature.Another breathtaking view is from the Chapel of the Transfiguration near Moose entrance. An amazing little chapel open during the day with a clear glass window view inside of the Tetons with a wooden cross in the center. They do have worship service on Sunday mornings.

We also hiked the Leigh Lake and String Lake Trails. All if which I would highly recommend. The Leigh and String Lake trails were much easier hikes than the hike to Hidden Falls, Inspiration Point and Cascade Canyon. And, the only wildlife we saw while hiking was the moose. We saw no signs of bear activity.The weather in mid-September was perfect and the park was not crowded at all.We rented a condo through VRBO in Jackson Hole.

Grand Teton,"This is a very nice National Parks with lots of water in several lakes. We loved the drive around the area. There are several places where on can get food, gas or lodging in the park. By the way there is a fee to enter. Maintain the proper speed limit as there are many park rangers that have nothing to do other that set up radar. When I first visited the area many years ago this was not the case. It’s apparently turning in to a revenue generating activity for the Nation Park Service If traveling north you will leave the Teton National park and enter Yellowstone. Be sure and allow plenty of time especially during the summer high season. The road will more than likely be closed in the winter according to one of the guides we listed to. If you have never been to this part of the United States you should certainly make it a point to add to your travel list.

I found very little in the way of quality hiking here. I characterize it as a rich man's national park. Not much effort is needed here by the visitor to get the most out of this park. I always appreciate a tough hike with a rewarding vista. Or braving the elements to watch a sunrise, fighting off sleep to watch a sunset.

I would like to go back in the fall and winter to see the large elk herds. All facilities were nice and the lake is beautiful. We recommend you take a boat ride on the lake.

At Jackson Lake you can rent a boat for a couple of hours, or take a tour and let one of the well informed guides entertain you.

The best closeup views are on Grand Teton road, but some of the panoramas from US 191 are also excellent. Wildlife can be found anywhere; we encountered a large herd of bison crossing US191 one day. Although it didn't work for us, there is a lesser known road known as Moose Wilson Road that is known for good wildlife sightings.

The newspaper you get at the entrance have all the relevant information about the park and about the activities with rangers. The kids can find their part of entertainment with rangers, too, and learn a lot! Every organized hike with rangers is full of different knowledge about the nature and geological changes. The movie at the visitor center introduced me to the park and it's worth to watch! The restaurants, gas station, groceries are all near the south entrance and near the visitor center.

But Yellowstone has all the geologic features AND many more animals. So, put side by side Yellowstone will win, in my opinion, every time. Does that mean you should skip GT? Absolutely NOT!

The Inn was 10minutes from the airport and within walking distance to downtown Jackson. The rate includes an unbelievable huge breakfast with lots of choices.Dinner at the Blue Lion was fabulous with a wonderful guitarist serenading us softly during our meal.Cafe Genevieve was a perfect place for lunch with great reasonable comfort food. Mad River Rafting was excellent for white water rafting and they supply wet suits,booties and slickers which I highly recommend as you will get wet and have a blast! Take the tram up the mountain in Jackson Village for unbelievable views and the best waffles and hot cocoa when you get out at the top.After two nights in Jackson, we headed to the Grand Teton National Park to stay at Signal Mountain Lodge. This could be the best family vacation spot ever! It is set on Jackson Lake surrounded by the Tetons with wrap around views that go on forever. We had a wonderful upper lake view unit 160 with two double beds, a big comfy leather sofa, stove top, microwave and full size fridge and bath.I would highly recommend an upper unit unless you have small children or a dog, then I would suggest a ground floor unit or separate log cabin. Our unit was smoke and pet free. Everything is very clean, but not fancy. There is a convenience store, gas station, gift shop, and three restaurants. with organic and gluten free options.The Peaks , has unbelievable views in a beautiful fire placed dining room with great food and service. The staff are friendly and helpful and seem genuinely happy to be working there.Andy set us up with a motorboat at the marina steps from our room to zip around the lake and explore some of the hidden coves. You could also canoe , kayak or rent a larger pontoon boat. Johanna , at the front desk, set us up with horseback riding at a family ranch about 25 minutes away followed by lunch at an adorable place called the Buffalo Cafe with great burgers and huckleberry shakes on a screened porch.Yellow Stone National Park is just minutes from Signal Mountain. Pack a picnic,water,beach towels , sunscreen and lots of bug spray and plan on a full day of exploring. We spent time swimming in Moose Falls and found a perfect picnic spot, but did't have enough time for the hour and a half trip to Old Faithful. The next day we took a shuttle boat to Jenny's Lake for some great hiking to beautiful Cascade Falls and amazing views from Inspiration Point.We had the best pizza and homemade ice cream 20 minutes from Signal ,at Leeks. The line was out the door, but well worth the wait. Once inside the big retro styled dining room overlooking the lake, we joined families of many different nationalities sitting at picnic tables sharing pizza and bopping to the oldies ,piped in from the ipods of the fantastic group of young people working there. Watching the staff singing and dancing as they worked made us all smile and enjoy the fabulous pizza even more.

Grand Teton,"It is truly unfortunate that people rush through Grand Teton National Park on their way to Yellowstone. My husband and I spent three nights in the Tetons in the summer of 2010 and were so sad to leave that we decided to return this summer for eight nights, all of them spent in the Colter Bay Cabins.. It was definitely not too long. We enjoyed each and every day; taking the hikes with the rangers, visiting the Lawrence Rockefeller Center as well as the Murrie cabin, and just being surrounded by absolute beauty. It was wonderful to be able to do everything at a liesurely pace. The ranger led hikes were generally three miles in length but took over two hours. Maybe because we're senior travelers we enjoyed the pace, but we learned so much along the way. We did go to Teton village twice, one morning and one evening in order to attend the Jackson Mlusic Festival, but other than that we spent our days in the Tetons. Wherever you look you are surrounded by magnificent scenery. We had read many of the reviews of the restaurants in the park and found it easier to take our meals in the various restaurants.

You don't have the crowds, just peace and quiet and wonderful scenery. Some of the dayhikes we wanted to do were still closed because of heavy snow on the trails.

Grand Teton,"Only spent couple of days each at Grand Tetons & Yellowstone, and needless to say that’s not enough time. Although both national parks are remarkable for different reasons, my favorite goes to the Tetons hands down. First, you have to be impressed with mountains as the constant backdrop – snowcapped, stately, and majestic in so many respects. There’s abundant wildlife (even during the day), breath-taking scenery (too many vantage points), and gorgeous hiking all around (only two we had time for). One of the best hikes is the cascade canyon trail, which you can shorten by taking the Jenny Lake shuttle across. One can side track to go to Hidden fall and Inspiration Point like most visitors but the stunning views comes when you hike deep (and up) the canyon trail. We were there in early June so it was packed snow but with good hiking boots you will be fine. Make sure you bring adequate water, layer your clothing (though most of us were still in t-shirts because it is strenuous), and start early so you can catch the boat ride back. Another great hike is Taggart Lake / Bradley Lake trail which again takes you to see some spectacular views. After the first couple of miles the trail does split, consider going and coming back on different segments of the trail as the different elevation will give you totally different views. The upper trail is very picturesque with mountains then against the lake background when you go higher up. The lower trail is very tranquil and charming when you walk along Taggart Lake. A note on the vantage points, when driving there are several overlooks on US191, which is excellent for the all encompassing view of the Teton Range. From deep within the park there are again numerous places along the Teton Park Road between Jackson Lake Junction and Jenny Lake Lodge. An unique view is to drive up Signal Mountain Rd., although the best vista point for the Tetons itself is not from the very top since it faces a different direction. Finally, further north on the road going towards Yellowstone there are couple more places that give you a view of Jackson Lake against yet another perspective of the Tetons","June 17, 2011",“Grand” is simply inadequate!!,110,"Chicago, Illinois",5

The route is very scenic and offers ample opportunities to see wildlife.","June 16, 2011",Nice Nice Nice....,13,"New York City, New York",5
Grand Teton,Scenery was beautiful and the weather was perfect the day we were there. There had been some recent snow so some of the trails were not open. The park rangers were very helpful in letting us know which ones were open or closed. Would definitely like to go back again.,"June 11, 2011",Beautiful,12,"Holton, Kansas",5
Grand Teton,"I highly recommend renting four wheelers and riding the trails in the Teton Park. They ROCK!! We packed snacks and spend half a day riding allover them. We even had one very inexperienced rider with us, and she enjoyed it too. Stay close together, because the forest is thick and you won't be able to see eachother otherwise. Bring a rain coat too, it sneaks up on you. The scenery from those trails is amazing!!","June 9, 2011",Beautiful place for ATV'S,19,"Dallas, Texas",5
Grand Teton,"Went to Grand Tetons after Yellowstone mid/end of May. There was still a lot of snow in both parks, so finding an open campground was hard. We were shooting for Jenny Lake, but ended up staying at Signal mountain campground. Only half the campground was open, but I managed to find a great site next to the lake (#17). There are almost 100 pitches, but the location is great. Had a wonderful meal at Jackson Lodge, and ducked into their bar till the rain let up a little bit. Next day was rained out again, so I headed to Steamboat Springs. When the skies did finally clear and reveal the Tetons, you could of sworn you just found heaven. What a magical place. Would love to go back and explore the trails and the water ways.","May 25, 2011",Heaven on Earth,25,"Bailey, Colorado",5

Grand Teton,Don't miss Schwabacher Landing for some great photographs and a beautiful easy walk along the Snake River. There are great water reflection shots of the Grand Tetons. The landing is just a short drive off the road.Another great close-to-the-road photo opportunity is Cunningham cabin. The rustic cabin is situated with the Grand Tetons as a backdrop.Oxbow Bend turnout offers a great shot of the Snake River and the Grand Tetons. Jackson Dam offers picture opportunities from both sides. Lots of water action on the river side and a placid lake on the dam side. Watch out for mesquitos. The drive up Signal Mountain to the Jackson Point Overlook is well worth your time. You have a terrific view of the entire area.,"August 24, 2010",Great spots for Photography in Grand Tetons,165,California,5
Grand Teton,"Grand Teton is beautiful. We stayed in the park and loved the views, the hikes and the abundant wildlife. We saw an ENTIRE wolf pack in the Teton National Forest. Bears are present near trails around North Jenny Lake.Ride the ferry from South Jenny Lake across the lake and take the hike to Inspiration Point. The hike is rocky but doable. Wear old shoes than can get muddy. The view is unbelievable of the glacier and the mountain's geology. We saw a mother moose and baby, marmots, chipmonks, lots of birds, and a huge falls. Few peoples are conducting lectures from 9th August to discuss about the changing climate of the Grand Teton Natinal park, which a attraction in Australia. Summer, autumn, and winter are the best times to visit the Northern Rockies. The days are sunny, the nights are clear, and the humidity is low. Typically, from mid-June on, you can hike, fish, camp, and watch wildlife, and if you come before July 4 or after Labor Day, you won't have to share the view all that much. Wildflowers bloom at these elevations in early summer -- beginning in May in the lower valleys and plains, while in the higher elevations they open up in July.","August 18, 2010",Attraction in Australia,22,Florida,2
Grand Teton,"Just returned from spending 4 nights in GTNP and then 4 in Yellowstone. First time for both. Grand Teton is so beautiful and there are so many beautiful trails/roads/etc that it's worth all the time you can afford. We stayed in a cabin at Colter Bay Marina. Loved it, the area has everything you could need, grocery, laundry, gift shop, gas station. I loved the sunset from Jenny Lake the best, it is lovely. Great area for photography, I'm pretty bad but I got a couple shots that are very nice. Lots of wildlife, lots of roads you can just pull of an wander. There a great little restaurant 1 mile from Colter Bay, at Leeks Marina. They have great pizza and the view from their deck of the mountains was terrific. A must is also driving up Signal Mtn. to the overlooks. Very nice. This is just a beautiful place, I hope I get to go back someday. It would be a great honeymoon destination for some lucky people! Oh, and we did see quite a bit of snow still on the mountains and it was July 2-6, the weather was around 65-70 degrees and just gorgeous stars out at night. You can almost touch them!! Enchanting!!","July 15, 2010",Enchanting!,52,Virginia,5
Grand Teton,"We have just returned from a 2 week fly drive holiday in Wyoming and Montana and had to finish at Salt Lake City for our flight home.Our main ""must do"" when planning the holiday was to see Yellowstone National Park, and we were not disappointed as the park is amazing.We have to admit that we were really just travelling through Grand Teton National Park as a means and route to get to Salt Lake City and as an afterthought had booked a couple of nights in Jackson to break up the journey and we are so glad that we did.Grand Teton is just as scenic as Yellowstone and is far less crowded, we also saw plenty of wildlife so don't regard Grand Teton as the poor relation of Yellowstone it is well worth spending time in the area and Jackson is a very nice town with plenty of restaurants, bars and hotels.","June 29, 2010",Excellent park with great views and wildlife,267,"Yorkshire, England",5

Grand Teton,"The road from Yellowstone to Grand Teton had only been open for 3 days when we visited in May 2010 - the views were spectacular, particularly with snow sparkling in the sunlight. However, the first views of the Teton Mountain Range were breathtaking and the views continually improved . Grand Teton is quite different to Yellowstone but well worth a visit nonetheless.","June 7, 2010",Breathtaking views,556,"Stockport, United Kingdom",5
Grand Teton,"This National Park is the most beautiful one. Yellowstone is nice, but the scenery here is outstanding. Take some of the walks, the one to Taggart Lake is very easy and the view is great. Inspiration point is just that an inspiration, but the walk is strenuous and if you have a fear of heights, this walk is not for you. The boat ride to this area from Jenny Lake visitor center is nice, but you need to be able to walk up some steep stairs to get to the walking trails, and they are not easy hikes. So if you have a hard time walking, need a cane, do not spend the money on the boat ride. Stop and see the view from Jackson Lake Lodge, just spend some time in the lobby looking out their windows, you will not be disappointed. Stop at Mormon Row, the view is great.","June 5, 2010",Need to See,163,"Houston, Texas",5
Grand Teton,"As soon as you arrive at the Jackson Hole airport, and look over at the Teton range it is breathtaking and unbelievable, it is the most beautiful thing I have seen in the U.S so far.We entered the park everyday of our 5 day trip, and we never tired of that view, at times we said it was hard to believe that we standing right in front of something that beautiful almost looked like a green screen.1 st day we were able to see Bison and Moose.We took at float trip with Dave Hansen, that was nice and relaxing on the snake river.We went to the rockefeller preserve and went on the phelps lake trail, gorgeous.We stopped at many different overlooks, snake river overlook is the best, its the picture point of one of ansel adams Grand Teton pictures.We saw Moose and Bison many times, plus a coyote and some Elk once.Another day we stopped at oxbow bend on our way to Yellowstone, that is abosolutely beautiful, with the reflection of the mtn in the lake.One other thing we did in the park was the Jenny lake trail, we walked the trail one way and took the ferry back, I would suggest to at least walk it one way if you can, then once the other side, we did hidden falls and inspiration point, I really enjoyed going up inspiration point, great views of jenny lake and of the Teton range.We did some of the Beaver creek trail also, but it was a little scary for us,we're not big hikers or anything, both in good shape, but that trail was so quiet, and we were on it for over an hour and only passed 1 other couple, we stopped and saw some bear claws on a tree, so we decided to turn back from where we were, and once we got to the parking area, we passed another couple who were about to start the trail, I knew to make noise so as to not walk up on and scare a bear, but will still decided to turn back, just incase.Overall Grand Teton is an amazing park, we loved it, I feel like the 5 days we had were enough to see everything you would want to see in GT, and we even went to Yellowstone for 2 out of those 5, only returning to GT to drive back to our hotel in Jackson hole each evening.Grand Teton is a wonderful park, lots to see and do","January 10, 2010",Breathtaking !,417,"Camas, Washington",5
Grand Teton,"The Grand Tetons are an imposing mountain range - easily recognizable when flying into Jackson Hole airport. A must visit - give yourself at least a full day. There's lots of turn-ins into this park - essentially all on the road towards Yellowstone if you start out from Jackson Hole/Teton Village and head north. We did one closest to Teton in the southern end called Jenny Lake. Nice easy 3 mile walk from visitor center around the lake to waterfall area. Waterfalls are nice to see. Since we had younger kids, we took the boat back across the lake. No food except at visitor center - definitely carry your own. Visitor area is clean, personnel helpful and the scenery fantastic.","November 12, 2009",Small yet majestic National Park,256,"Skillman, New Jersey",5

As we rounded a cruve, there was the most incredible range of peaks with the sun illuminating them from behind. The sight literally brought tears to my eyes! We stopped to take in the magnificent view. As we continued on our journey, we encountered the same peaks from many different angles, each one more dramatic and spectaluar than the last. The next 2 days brought overcast skies, as predicted, and we even got to take the boat across Jenny Lake and hike to Inspiration Point in a steady snowfall. We saw elk, bison, moose, eagles, beavers and a blue heron. But our first view of the mountains was the clearest one we saw","October 21, 2009",Awesome,5,"abington, pa",5

Grand Teton,"In my short experience, Grand Teton has been one of the most memorable outdoor experiences. The Mountains are absolutely gorgeous and the best part is that there are so many places where you can stop and take in the scenery. This was a big plus for me as I am unable to hike, but I didn't feel shortchanged for not being able to go too deep into the wilderness.If you are going to Yellowstone as well, make sure you buy the combo pass and save $$$, I made the mistake of buying passes separately.I was not sure if I wanted to stop by Grand Teton during my latest roadtrip, I was on my way to Yellowstone and thought I could just admire the Mountains from afar. I'm glad I did stop. More on my WY experience at http://tr.im/KAAWY","September 14, 2009",A Majestic Treat on the way to Yellowstone,6,"Los Angeles, California",5
Grand Teton,"Unfortunately, we only spent ½ a day hiking on the way to Yellowstone. The scenery (mountains, lakes, wildlife) is breathtaking. We skipped the boat to cross Jenny Lake and decided to hike from String Lake to Jenny Lake’s west shore and up to Hidden Falls. The hike was enjoyable as it ran along the creek that connects the two lakes. After passing the dock and seeing how crowded the boats were I am glad we skipped the ferry. We also hike Schwabacher’s Landing. This was quiet easy hike along Snake River. It provided great views of the mountain range. It was a bite of trek to get to the parking lot so make sure you have a semi-off road vehicle. We definitely want to return and spend more time exploring the park.","August 8, 2009",Wish we spent more time,94,,5

Grand Teton,"My family and I traveled out west from Illinois...By Car, with gas prices over $4.00/gallon.We were in the area from July 5, 2008 - July 12, 2008. It was one of the best vacations we ever had. We rented a condo in the Aspens just West of Jackson Hole. Easy drive to Jackson Hole, and only a few miles to the entrance of the Grand Teton National Park. Just a perfect spot for getting places.Kids ages 9-16 had a great time. I highly recommend taking a scenic float trip down the Snake River at night. We saw moose, elk, eagles, beaver, and gorgeous scenery. We used Barker/Ewing company to book, and our guide Steve H. was fabulous. He knew so much about the area. It was like sitting around a campfire listening to stories of the West, but actually floating down the river.My older kids rented a kayak at Colter Bay and spent two great hours on Jackson Lake. The views are breathtaking, and there is no way to acurately describe them. You must see for yourselves.Ate 2 times at the Gun Barrel in Jackson. Very good, and great menu for kids. Also Q Roadhouse BBQ. GREAT!, There is a Bagel place in Wilson and Jackson has the name street in it. WOW! Go early morning, they are making bagels on site. My bag I got was hot and the taste was incredible.Jenny Lake is a MUST see/do item also. Take the boat across the lake and hike up to Inspiration Point. Hidden Falls along the path is majestic. Do not miss this one.Worth the drive?? You bet! Worth the price of gas? Absolutely! Am I going back? Passionate about it!","August 10, 2008",Grand Teton National Park,55,"Champaign, Illinois",5
Grand Teton,"Vacationed in early June '08. Be warned - unfortunately it was unseasonable cold in WY - highs in the 40's a couple days (not high of 69 degrees as stated on weather.com as average). Don't be surprised if it gets cold in early June. We made the best of it and still did most of the activities we had planned. Day 1 Jenny Lake hike to Hidden Falls and Inspiration Point - great hike!!! We did the alpine slide in Jackson in the late afternoon - a bit pricy but the kids loved it. Dinner at Rendezvous café - nice place. Toured Downtown Jackson which is a must. We even did the Stagecoach ride through town which was pretty good. Day 2 Bridger Gondola ride in Teton Village. This was fun. The heavy snow last winter was not yet melted so we were not able to hike much at the top but still was fun - snowball fights in June. We did the 5:30 PM raft trip with Solitude inc. that night and HIGHLY recommend it!!!! We saw a ton of wildlife including a grizzly bear from a distance which I guess is rare in GTNP. A great raft float trip. Oh by the way we stayed at Moulton Valley Cabins which we highly recommend. Secluded, awesome views, good cabins and nice south park location (closer to Jackson). Day 3 The horseback ride at Jackson Lake Lodge was good then we did a general tour of GTNP overlooks and sites.","July 14, 2008",Grand Teton - Nice!,30,Ohio,5
Grand Teton,"There are some nice scenic hikes, a few lakes and some limited wildlife viewing. We stayed in park for 4 days, after 4 days in Yellowstone.Some of the so called ""attractions"" are nothing more than tourist traps.In my opinion, GTNP and YSNP worth a ONE visit, and that is mainly for geological points of Yellowstone. Considering the travel expense and flight time from California, we take any island of Hawaii any day, for their truely unique nature, and visitor-friendly people.","October 6, 2007",Overrated,69,"Orange, California",2
Grand Teton,"We spent four days at Grand Teton (Jackson Lake Lodge, review posted) and absolutely fell in love with it. Going to Yellowstone afterwards was more ""interesting"" but less satisfying in many ways. Grand Teton is just simply gorgeous and while there aren't as many ""attractions"" as Yellowstone, there is so much to see, do and so much to enjoy that I wish we had had a couple more days.Other than the requisite float trip on the Snake River and Horseback Riding, we filled our days with the boat across Jenny Lake and the hike to Inspiration Point which was fantastic (our 9 year old made it only half way but our 11 year old led the way for me up to the Point). We also went on various other smaller hikes. One of our favorite days there was a trip we took out of the park to the area of the Gros Ventre landslide. This has to be seen to be believed. Find Antelope Flats Road and take it out through buffalo filled fields and fantastic scenery and follow the signs to the short trail at Gros Ventre. It was so ""off the beaten path"" and so beautiful that we all loved it. We also drove through the Teton pass from Jackson Hole into Idaho and then back which was just gorgeous.This place is almost paradise. Yellowstone is more unique and there's more ""to do"" but coming back through Grand Teton on our way to the airport in Jackson was like coming home. If you're going to Yellowstone, make sure you spend at least two or three days in GT, you won't regret it.","August 7, 2004",Absolutely the best!,551,ann arbor michigan,5
