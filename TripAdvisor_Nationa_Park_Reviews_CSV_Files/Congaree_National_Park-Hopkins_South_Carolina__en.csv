Congaree National Park,"My friend and I canoed on Cedar Creek from Cedar Creek Landing all the way to the Congaree River, finishing at Bates Bridge Boat Landing at Hwy 601. It's a 20-mile trail that requires countless portages due to numerous fallen Cypress and Tupelo trees on the creek. The water level in the first half of September was 2-3 ft. Sometimes there were so many obstacles that we doubted whether we were on the right trail. Once, we doubted so much that we traveled back to a fork in the creek. Then we discovered we had been on the right trail the first time! So, we had to travel that way again. In the end, we carried our boat over several of the same obstacles twice. We tried to wash the mud from our hands with black creek water so we could replenish our energy with a snack. We had to attempt to clean our hands this way every time we wanted to eat, as our hands were constantly getting dirty as we navigated around fallen trees. At some points on the trail, we could remain in the boat by lying on our backs on the bottom of the canoe so we could squeeze under a fallen trees. A few times we had to get out of water and portage on the creek bank, which was a nightmare. It was extremely hard to portage on the land as it was very muddy. We often found ourselves up to our knees in mud. Often we had to portage over trees, a couple of times slipping into the black water of the creek. Snakes weren't an issue as we hardly saw them. We did see some otters along the trail. We met many fluffy spiders that had spun webs on fallen trees; while we were going under those trees they were hanging right above our faces.The creek portion of trail took us 7 hours to complete. We had rented a Ford F250 to pick up the canoe from a rental place in downtown Columbia. Then, we locked the canoe to a tree at Cedar Creek Landing. Next, we drove our 4Runner and the truck to Bates Bridge Landing. We left the truck there and drove back to the Cedar Creek Landing to start our adventure at around noon.By the time we got to Congaree River, it was 7 pm. We had another 13-14 mi to go. We canoed a big portion of it in the dark at the mercy of the light of moon. It was nearly full, generously shining on the river enough to make the path ahead visible. We also had a powerful light that we were using only on the turns to make sure we don't hit branches of trees possibly fallen in the river or land on the bank of the river. I cannot say it was a very pleasant experience. We were constantly hearing strange noises, not being able to identify the source. I fell asleep a couple of times for a second or two while canoeing. We eventually finished, arriving at Bates Bridge Boat Landing just past 10 pm.It was a life experience unlike any other. I have no regrets. However, I certainly do NOT wish to try it a second time. It was a sweet nightmare. How can I not say it was sweet, while we were blessed by the scenery of those beautiful marvelous Cypress and Tupelo trees, sounds of Otters and birds, those scary spiders, and watching strong lightning happening on the distance while we were at the mercy of the moonlight paddling on the astonishing Congaree River at night with no one around. It was us and nature alone!","October 12, 2019","Canoeing on Cedar Creek, Congaree National Park",0,,5
Congaree National Park,"I was pleasantly surprised when I visited here as a side trip on my way to Florida. A 2.8 mile boardwalk through the forest was an enjoyable walk on an early Fall morning. Lots of cypress and loblolly pines along with birds, reptiles, amphibians and other wildlife.","October 9, 2019",Beautiful,1,"Beachwood, New Jersey",4
Congaree National Park,"My wife and I visited Congaree National Park on a recent visit to the Columbia area. I recommend starting at the visitor center. We talked to the rangers ahead of time to figure out the trails we wanted to hike and their conditions. The park was stunning! We started out on the boardwalk and hiked down to the Weston Lake Loop Trail. We saw a doe and a wild boar. There was also many types of trees including some massive ones! The Loblolly Pines were particularly tall and impressive! I have never seen trees that massive in the eastern US. There were also several lakes and a creek. It was such a peaceful, relaxing place! I look forward to visiting again in the near future!","October 8, 2019",Beautiful Forests and Trails,215,"Tallahassee, Florida",5
Congaree National Park,"The boardwalk trail at The Congaree National Park was a great option for our family. My daughter has special needs and I’m always worried about her slipping when we are hiking. This trail is elevated with a relatively smooth path and rails gave me peace of mind for my daughter. Would be great for families with small children and the elderly. It’s about a 2.4 mile loop with plenty to see along the way. There is also a nice gift shop at the entrance of the trail complete with souvenirs, maps and bug spray. Also exterior bathrooms and a water fountain if you are out after the gift shop closes. FYI - there are lots of bugs in the summer and it is incredibly hot and humid under the canopy of the trees. Lots of shade but not much of a breeze gets down through those trees. Make sure you bring plenty of water! ","October 3, 2019",elevated boardwalk trail,4,"Elizabethtown, Kentucky",5
Congaree National Park,"Arrived late afternoon on National Public Lands Day for a leisurely stroll. During the walk we saw a rattlesnake (off the boardwalk), red-headed woodpecker, pileated woodpecker, prothonotary warbler, wild pig (small), several squirrels, turtles and bream at the Weston Lake overlook, and many Golden Silk Spiders (Nephila clavipes). Always an adventure... even on the boardwalk.","September 29, 2019",Boardwalk Loop,17,"Columbia, South Carolina",5
Congaree National Park,"After my meeting in St. Matthews’s, I decided to check out this National Park and I am thankful I did. The park is beautiful and features the largest remaining tract of old-growth bottomland hardwood forest remaining in North America. There is a visitor center with a short film explaining about the park. There is also a two mile plus elevated boardwalk that takes you into the wilderness to experience nature. There are benches along the boardwalk where you can sit and enjoy the quiet. ","September 25, 2019",Beautiful and peaceful National Park ,320,"Cookeville, Tennessee",5
Congaree National Park,"This is not a National Park where hoards of people pour in to take in the sites. It is a beautiful, calm and unusual Park. The boardwalk, leading from the visitor’s center, identifies trees will see. It is an easy walk, too. You can choose to leave the boardwalk and take the Weston Lake Trail, which not only extends your walk, but you will be high on a dirt path. It is a fairly quiet walk which enables you to hear the fauna and you can almost hear the old growth trees growing. Such a beautiful, peaceful walk. Plan to spend several hours. We used misquote spray, but did not have a problem with the bugs. ","September 4, 2019",Beautiful and peaceful,65,,5
Congaree National Park,We hiked about 6 miles down the river walk and had to turn around. Freaking snake was sitting on a tree branch right by my head on the trail no joke. I only noticed it when it was a foot away.

Congaree National Park,We went out of our way to go to this park as my spouse loves trees and parks. It had rained hard the day/night before we went so we chose the boardwalk trail. Other trails are through the park and they have different lengths. On the boardwalk You get to walk above dry and wet lands. The signage and information in the provided flier was interesting. They do have a short video which i would recommend that you view before your walk. The rangers are friendly and pleasant and we enjoyed our visit. ,"August 28, 2019",A great park,103,"Englewood, Florida",5
Congaree National Park,"Tho there are other trails, we only did the 2.4 mile boardwalk. There are many large baldcypress, loblolly pine and beech trees here. You will see the curious cypress ""Knees"" thought to protect the trees during storms and flooding. At the time we were here , mid August' there were lots of big spiders with their webs crossing the boardwalk. We also saw skinks with brilliant blue tails, squirrels, and turtles. The park literature says they are mistakenly called a ""swamp"" when they are actually an ""old-growth bottomland hardwood forest periodically flooded by groundwater or surface water."" I don't think they are going to convince people to call it that!!It is a pleasant walk where you need to look for small things. Great for wheelchairs.","August 21, 2019",Excellent Park for a Wheelchair.,149,"Dayton, Ohio",4
Congaree National Park,"My family stopped here for a rest on a road trip. We took the 2.4 mile boardwalk hike which probably took us about 45 minutes because we stopped several times to look at bugs and animals. This is an easy hike and we took a stroller with no issues. It was incredibly hot in August, so be sure to bring water in the summer. Keep your eyes peeled for spiders!!! Always keep your head up. Even with tons of hikers, there were still spots where giant spiders made webs across the path where you could walk right into if you aren’t paying attention.","August 19, 2019",Spiders!,21,,4
Congaree National Park,"We only had time to hike the raised boardwalk, but saw coons digging for crabs and a snake wrapped around the handrail...I think it was a red bellied water snake. Other visitors saw an alligator at the the viewing platform near the river.

Congaree National Park,At the Visitor Center you can watch the video on the history of the park before you plunge into it.

Congaree National Park,"Congaree is a pure hidden gem of South Carolina as it is surprisingly Unknown. Me and my parents had a great time on the boardwalk trail really reccomend it. The bluff trail is a scenic trail of floodplain wilderness. Great staff at the Harry Hampton visitor center and wonderful presentation of the park in the theater. Its a short drive from Columbia,SC and has a beautiful scenic drive. Really reccomend this to any family. Best time to go would be December or January as the summer months are okay but get hot and humid. On some occasions Congaree is open at nighttime and puts on a show of wonderful synchronous fireflies at your display! If your going canoeing on the Congaree river its best to be aware of your surroundings as it contains lots of wildlife. If kids come along for the trip its best to go on the trails as canoeing is for a more mature and experienced audience. If your an extreme outdoor enthusiast going by yourself to conquer a hard trail the kingsnake trail (a 7.2 mile trail) as there's even longer trails than that. Other than that i really reccomend this to all families. One more thing! If your going to go to Congaree you must see the odd wooden stools called knees that grow around the trees for some odd reason. Enjoyed the trip!","July 23, 2019",Amazing place!,2,"Canton, Georgia",5
Congaree National Park,"I briefly walked on the Broadway trail, but didn't see very much because the two people I was traveling with did not want to walk any further. However, what I saw was nice. I'll have to come back and see some of the taller trees and alligators when I'm alone alone.","July 17, 2019",Nice Park,4,"Dillon, South Carolina",4
Congaree National Park,"Some of the neighborhoods you must drive through to get to the Congaree National Park are a bit sketchy. A lot of homes have chain link fence around the entire property, uncut lawns, trash, and old junky cars. Fuel up along the nearby interstate before you arrive because you may want to think twice about accessing these gas stations. Upon our arrival, the person who was working at the Visitor’s Center could care less that we entered. His back was to the door. He sat in a chair with his head buried in his personal phone. I greeted him and he was anything but welcoming. We watched an 18-minute video, looked at some displays, and walked on the Boardwalk Trail. If mosquitoes bother you, then bring the bug spray. A small canister costs $6.95 in the Gift Shop. Have a contingency plan if a wasp bites you. Snakes are everywhere. Wear shoes that do not slide on a wet boardwalk made of would. This particular trail does accommodate a wheelchair. ","July 10, 2019",The Boardwalk Trail,243,"Reading, Pennsylvania",4
Congaree National Park,"We visit many national parks and unfortunately, this is probably the least impressive one we have seen. Is it worth a visit? Absolutely. It's just not as grand as the others. We drove up to see it on a trip to Myrtle Beach. It was pretty hot in July, but the trees do provide a nice canopy. Definitely bring bug spray. The bugs were bad, but not unmanageable. There is no food at the park, so plan ahead or stop along the way. We saw some wildlife-- turtles, lizards, cranes, and raccoons.","July 10, 2019",Just can't compare,82,"Berwick, Maine",4
Congaree National Park,Walked the boardwalk- unique scenery and history. Not a highly visited park and it’s sort of out of the way. Wish I had more time to explore. I understand it’s very popular during certain times of the year for the beautiful fireflies. We went in June and it was very warm and humid at 95 degrees. Some mosquitoes. I would plan an entire trip around it bits it’s another one of our lovely national parks that if you can see it- you should do so. The two rangers at the desk seemed very bored and basically directed me to the printed materials. ,"June 30, 2019",Stop if you cwn,40,"Delray Beach, Florida",4

Congaree National Park,"Great hiking trails through the swamp. Enjoyed the Boardwalk Trail and various other trails walking deeper into the swamp--plan on getting muddy if you get off the Boardwalk. A lot of wild pigs in swamp as you can see their rooting areas throughout but we did not see any, just a large orange belly water snake. Surprisingly, misquotes weren't bad but the horse flies were.

Congaree National Park,"This park blew me away. I wasn’t expecting much because it’s not talked about that much, but wow. My visit was so peaceful and everything I saw was amazing. The staff were nice and informative. The scenery was unlike any I’d ever seen before. I took one of the longer trails and it was a bit muddy, but that added to the adventure. A lot of the time I was by myself and got to enjoy the serene environment. At the end of my hike I saw an alligator, three turtles, and some alligator gar fish. I’ve been to many national parks and this one made it into my top 5 because of how wonderful my visit was.","June 4, 2019",Absolutely amazing!,6,"Willcox, Arizona",5
Congaree National Park,"We've been to many National parks, and this one was different than all the others, and enjoyable. We walked the 2.4 mile boardwalk trail and saw interesting trees, wildlife (alligator, snake, raccoon, woodpecker and more) and learned about the importance of the swamp to the environment.","June 3, 2019",The boardwalk was a great way to see the park,31,California,5
Congaree National Park,"We visited on one of the first few days that the fireflies became synchronous, which also happened to be midweek. Arriving early, a bit before 5pm, anticipating crowds, we were able to get a close in parking spot and the crowd never became an issue on the night we visited.Ahead of sundown and the fireflies, we used the nice picnic area to enjoy our picnic dinner, hiked the length of the 2.4 mile (3.9k) boardwalk trail, and the kids completed their Junior Ranger earning their badges. While this may seem strange to some, the swamp along the boardwalk is beautiful and we saw snakes, turtles, deer and an owl along with other birds, huge cypress trees with their numerous knees, and some massive loblolly pines. This easy trail through the last remaining old growth bottomlands swamp is well worth a visit on its own.As sunset approached, access to the boardwalk trail was closed and the short, approximately 1/8 mile (0.2k), firefly trail was opened. As the skies darkened, the fireflies became more numerous and eventually several dozen became synchronous as the number steadily increased until hundreds became apparent along the short trail. At times they became asynchronous for short periods and at other times, the fireflies seemed to flash “the wave’ across the forest. We feel fortunate to have been able to see this rare, unusual, natural phenomena that happens for about two weeks each year in the latter half of May and sometimes into June.We look forward to the opportunity to return to Congaree to hike some of the other trails and hopefully to take a guided canoe trip on Cedar Creek which is offered on many Fridays and Saturdays throughout the year and, like entrance to the park, is free.","May 29, 2019",Beautiful Swamp and Synchronous Fireflies,3757,"Avon, Ohio",5
Congaree National Park,"Went 5/25/19 for the Firefly event. Used COMET to go from the fairgrounds to the park - THIS IS THE ONLY WAY ONE SHOULD GO TO THIS EVENT. Dropped us off at the entrance (Others who drove to the park had to park up to a mile away and walk along a trail to get to the entrance.) The crowd was big, the viewing area small, the fireflies were few. We were told that the first part of the two week period is always better. The smell of bug spray was absolutely overwheming EVERYWHERE we walked. I suspect the fireflies were as annoyed by the smell as we were. Why one puts on bug repellent when they want to see bugs is puzzling indeed!","May 27, 2019",Bug spray vs Fire Flies,198,"Martinez, Georgia",3

Congaree National Park,"The Congaree National Park features ancient marsh laden forests, great facilities that interpret the area pretty well and a staff that should give any of the other NPS sites a run for their money on any day of the week. Every Spring they have this synchronous firefly event for a few weeks...and it is amazing. I grew up in the Midwest and we had lightning bugs with their amber lights that would flash with about the same speed of a stoplight in a one stoplight town. Very peaceful. This is different - these fireflies should be called lightning bugs - gone is the peaceful amber lights replaced by a frenetic white LED that kind of go on and off together as a large group. It’s like Christmas lights - it’s pretty cool. I’ve never seen anything like this in nature and apparently, ALOT of other people have not either. It gets very crowded, so if you can avoid the peak days, I would highly recommend that - but recommend it I do! Sorry - no photos on this one - the flash messes with the fireflies. Also, for this event only, pets are not allowed - it’s just too crowded. ","May 25, 2019",Firefly Show Is Awesome!!!,342,"Charleston, South Carolina",5

Congaree National Park,"A wonderful way to see a wonderful National Park - the canoe trip is an out-and-back paddle on a small, slow flowing creek that separates the higher ground of the bluff from the flat bottom land floodplain and allows you to see a good cross-section of the park and some of the flora and fauna of this special place.","May 7, 2019",Cedar Creek Canoe Tour,13,"Columbia, SC",5
Congaree National Park,"As one walks along one of the many trails, there are times when there is complete silence. Then, there is a chorus of bird calls and other creatures that could probably have been heard hundreds of years ago. To offset this, there are the frequent sounds of planes from the nearby airport bringing us back to the present.I do not recommend even the shortest trail during the heat of summer for anyone not acclimated to very hot and humid conditions. Bring mosquito repellent and water.","May 7, 2019",A Walk Back in Time,9,,4

Congaree National Park,"Love this park. Easy hike along a boardwalk. We strolled the main loop and spent 2.5 hours just taking in the nature sounds and bird watching. Saw a barred owl, Scarlett tanager, and many other birds. Enjoyed watching a raccoon climb a tree and turtles swim in a lake. Enjoyed a picnic at their tables near the parking lot. Definitely worth a visit.","April 28, 2019",Great Bird Watching,12,"Louisburg, North Carolina",5
Congaree National Park,"Congaree is one of the smaller and lesser-known national parks. It protects one of the last remaining areas of bottomland forests, which used to stretch from the east coast of the US to Texas. Large areas of the park flood multiple times each year, so be sure to check on park alerts in advance. Our favorite activity was a canoe tour, which was led by an intern and volunteers. This tour showed us a part of the park that we otherwise could not have seen, and the guides explained what we were seeing along the way and why those features are important to the park. These tours are offered only a few times each year, and they sell out as soon as they open up, so be sure to look at the website for information about how to book the tours and when they will be offered. There are many hikes -- we did the 2.4 mile boardwalk hike, which has numbered stops along the way, and a brochure is provided so you can know more about each stop. The boardwalk has benches at regular intervals, so you can take a break, and it is wheelchair/stroller friendly. I would recommend this park in early spring before it gets so hot outside and before the bugs are really bad. There is a nice visitor center with an informative film, and there are a few snack choices (granola bars, trail mix, etc.) and a vending machine for drinks. There is NOT a restaurant at the park and the nearest place to get a meal is about 20 minutes away. Visiting Congaree is a good one day trip (maybe 2 if you do more hikes or camp).

Congaree National Park,We stayed in Rock hill sc and once I saw there was a national park within a 2 hour drive I was in the car already. Congaree is essentially right outside Columbia SC but the park does not feel like your near a large city. In fact the drive into the park is scenic and laid back. Upon arriving in the park signage is well placed and the visitor center is easy to find. Inside you can learn about the history of the land that’s now the park. I only did the boardwalk trail but wow it was amazing. Walking amongst trees of that size is quite a feeling. There are multiple other trails with much bigger trees. The only downside to my visit would be there were no ranger tours out on the water. I believe those were on the weekends?

Congaree National Park,"We stopped here on our way from Asheville to Charleston. It was a nice respite from a heavy day of travel and activity the day before. We enjoyed seeing the old growth forest and walking on the boardwalk trail. There had been a lot of flooding, so much of the boardwalk was closed (under water) and so were many of the trails. That wasn't an issue for us as we were had limited time to visit anyway. It is wonderful that this forest is preserved.

Congaree National Park,"We visited the day after a significant rainfall in an already very wet autumn. This was a boon in that we were able to observe the park in full flood. In that this park is a preserve of hard wood floodplain forest, the flood process is integral to its ecology and broad bio-diversity. Seeing the park during full flood made for interesting view of the forest while we walked the elevated boardwalk in 2 sections totaling nearly 2 miles overall. While we missed the opportunity to explore other park trails (they were under water), we were glad to see it when we did. We can plan an alternate time to visit during a dry event to explore other trails, but I believe we saw the best the park can offer. This park is free admission and it does offer tent camping facilities.","March 10, 2019",Go during full flood,93,"Fallston, Maryland",5

Congaree National Park,"We visited after a ton of rain had fallen in the week before, in mid-November, and had planned on only doing the boardwalk trail loop. We were surprised to find out on arrival that half of the loop was closed due to flooding, and sure enough, the boardwalk lowered down into murky water and disappeared at those points! Luckily, half of the boardwalk was built elevated, so we could still walk that half and experience the park that way. That meant an out and back hike, instead of a loop, which took the same amount of time as the loop would have, and apparently meant we also missed the areas where the cypress trees grow. It was still a very worthwhile visit. I wished I had chosen different shoes, though, as the boardwalk itself was wet, with fallen leaves on it, and together these things made it verrrrry slippery. I slipped and slid around several times and eventually fell down entirely. Better shoe traction would have helped a lot! On the positive side, the boardwalk is dog friendly, so I was glad my pup could come with us!","December 13, 2018",Boardwalk trail,336,"New York City, New York",5

Congaree National Park,"We went the Saturday after Thanksgiving. It was a cool overcast day and we were hoping to have the park to ourselves, WRONG. However, it was not that crowded and it was actually good to see people out there enjoying the park.Great time of the year to visit as there are no bugs. Part of the boardwalk was flooded. This is common and one must remember, this is a swamp that is in a floodplain. It will flood. The beauty of this boardwalk is that a lot of it is low at the water level which outs you down at the swamp level and gives an interesting perspective. This is also why it floods.There are several trails, not just the boardwalk. Highly recommend you check in at the visitor center to check the status of the trails so there are no surprises. Take the time to read the boardwalk brochure to learn about what you are seeing. This is not a ""destination"" National Park. What I mean by this, I would not travel a long distance JUST to visit this park. If you are in the area it is a wonderful park to plan a day trip to. As a Nation Park, it is still young.

Congaree National Park,"We stopped on the way home. I'm so glad we went in November because it wasn't buggy. I would never visit a swamp in the summer! It's the only National Park we've visited which allowed dogs on the trails...which was great since we had our dog with us. We loved the boardwalk trail which was raised above the flooded swamp. Seeing the large pines and small palmettos was very peaceful. The trail was very quiet and peaceful, save for the gunshots we heard in the distance, which was a bit unnerving. The movie in the visitor center was excellent. The visitor center also had an interesting display about the old growth trees.

Congaree National Park,"Although the park is about 18 miles from Columbia, SC, the capital, it seems of another time. These swamps were part of the haunt of Francis Marion, aka ""The Swamp Fox"" of Revolutionary War fame. I can see why the British could not catch him. A word of warning: no services in or near the park. Eat and gas up in Columbia. They do have restrooms, a few vending machine type snacks, and potable water at the visitor's center. The visitor's center is open from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., 7 days a week except for Federal holidays. The park is open 24 hours a day. There is no fee.There is a small museum and an on-demand film at the visitor's center. Ranger led walks on the boardwalk, Big Tree hikes, and canoe tours (3 1/2 hours) are available. See the website for dates and times. The canoe tours are only Spring Season: April 1-May 31 (Fridays & Saturdays)Fall Season: September 1-November 17 (Fridays & Saturdays)You may also walk the boardwalk on your own w/the help of a brochure that talks about the flora and fauna. There are also trails on the ground that regularly are under water. Watch for snakes.If you enjoy visiting national parks, I think you should consider this one simply because it is so different. I suggest October or November because there are very few insects. Otherwise, bring LOTS of insect spray. It is a swamp, and mosquitoes abound.","November 10, 2018",Interesting experience unlike any other U.S. National Park,596,"Austin, Texas",3

You can mostly see cypress and hardwoods along boardwalk w/ hardwood bottomland forest and big trees along Weston Lake trail. Plant community rather uniform w/ limited plant species diversity. At least no bugs this time of year (end of October). Summer must be HORRIBLE. I would only go back to canoe, but I have spent a fair amount of time in bald cypress-tupelo swamps in southern Illinois.

Congaree National Park,"Our family loves visiting National Park sites so we were very excited to be visiting Congaree National Park after spending time in Charleston, South Carolina. However we went on Labor Day and were very disappointed to find that the visitor center was closed. This is reflected on their website which I should have checked but I found it pretty unusual especially for a National Park. I can understand that some of the smaller more obscure National Monument sites might be closed but there are only 59 sites designated as a National Park which are supposed to be the best the Park Service has to offer. Thankfully the gates were open so the park could still be enjoyed but there were a lot of people who came to the park and were similarly disappointed. There is very little in the area surrounding the park so we got food when we exited the interstate 30 miles or so outside the park and ate it at a picnic pavilion by the visitor center. We loaded up on bug spray but really didn’t seem to have a problem with bugs. We walked the entire boardwalk trail and brought along the brochure that details the numbered stops and read them to our kids. The hike went by surprisingly fast and it was enjoyable to see this unique environment.We enjoyed our visit to Congaree National Park but were far from blown away. Some of the reviews here gush about the park and how amazing it is and I don’t get that.

The campground was nice though you do have to park your car in a parking lot and hike all your gear into the campsite. Definitely recommend getting one of the first three sites.

Congaree National Park,"We went in early September at about 4 p.m. It was very hot, humid, and full of bugs (mosquitoes). The visitor center sells bug spray but but we brought our own -- which is very much needed. They even have a bug meter at the visitor center. Most of the park revolves around a boardwalk around the swamp between the trees. When were were there, the park was dry, which I think takes away from the look. The coolest things were seeing the tree knees -- pointy stumpy things. Other than that, the views on the boardwalk are pretty repetitive -- trees and dirt. No special features, flowers, or amazing Instagram shots. There is a small lake at one point, but it was so full of mosquitoes, one did not want to linger. And the view there was also not that special. The boardwalk loop is a total of a little over 2 miles. By the end, I was running it because I just wanted it to be over as it seemed never-ending and I felt like I was in a sauna. This is on the lower end of national parks. The visitor center was just ok. A small store, and minimal exhibits.","September 11, 2018",Can Be Unpleasant,79,"Los Angeles, California",3

I had been worried that it would be too hot to enjoy on an August afternoon, but was pleasantly surprised that almost the entire hike is in the shade. And being a boardwalk trail, almost no exertion required. We were diligent with the bug spray, so this was not a problem.

The brief movie offered in the visitor center gave a good understanding of the history and significance of the park to the nearby area.

You can always check the mosquito meter near the bathrooms if you unsure of the conditions. The bathrooms are air conditioned and there are water fountains for use.

The raised boardwalk trail is about 1.5 hours at a leisurely pace, where you will see some of the tallest, oldest specimens of some species of trees to be found anywhere in the USA. This national park is a gem, and not bustling with tourists. Be sure to watch the 15 min. documentary about the park, shown in the auditorium, BEFORE touring the park; it will make you enjoy your visit even more when you realize how fragile the ecosystem is in this park, and the decades long effort to have this unique forest certified as a national park. There is a small museum in the Visitors Center that is well done and interesting to meander about. A tidy little gift shop area near the entrance where you can purchase books, postcards, caps, tee shirts, etc. with a portion of the proceeds from sales helping to support the park. This park can get lots of skeeters in the summer, but was absent any when we visited in April, so plan accordingly. The only wildlife we encountered was one squirrel LOL, but we were not hiking the less traversed trails. Park staff (1 man, 1 young lady) was friendly and answered questions cheerfully.

The park visitor's center is small but nice. I would recommend taking a snack or pack a lunch. There are drinks and some snacks available at the visitor's center, but if you stay for the day, it is better to bring your own food.

So we walked the boardwalks that were not flooded. The old forest pines and cypress were huge and pines may rise over 160 feet. The visitor center is great and the place is free though donations are welcome. We can't wait to go back and do the other trails.

We camped for two nights and found the campground area extremely clean with nearby composting toilets (no running water, however). It is primitive camping - which means hauling in everything you need (water, etc.) The Visitor's center staff, park rangers, and volunteers were friendly and helpful. The two big events for us at the Park were seeing the synchronized fire flies at night and a canoe trip offered by the park service. Both events were worth the trip to the park in and of themselves. The synchronized fire flies were for us impossible to capture on camera, but best described as nature's Christmas light display. This only occurs a couple of weeks out of the year. An experience for a lifetime to behold. On the canoe trip, we saw all kinds of wildlife from barred owls to snakes. It was breathtakingly beautiful to float down in silence taking in the sights and sounds of a swamp. You do need to make reservations for the canoe trip, and it is only offered certain times of the year.

I don't go to many places that can carry me away but Congaree is for sure like that for me. No where in the US eastern states can one feel nature so vividly and all around you. I mean wild and even a little dangerous if one doesn't take care, as when you enter the part you feel like a visitor to another world. I guess you can tell, I was amazed at this place.

We got lucky and hit it on a day with the sun hiding behind clouds, before the heat and mosquitoes arrived. So it was very pleasant. Just a few minutes outside Columbia, SC, Congaree is an old-growth, tropical rain forest with huge trees. Although we took our time and carefully watched for wildlife along the trails, we only saw birds and lizards. The park features miles of loop trails, some primitive, some paved and some boardwalks. The latter would even provide opportunity for people in wheelchairs. For about half the year, this place would feature mosquitoes like the Everglades. But if you visit in the dry, cooler months, it's quite pleasant. Just be prepared to be underwhelmed by the maps they provide, and be prepared for a walk much longer than you expected. It is challenging to stay on the trail you want. A visitor center provides the usual, superior national park info and resources. Allow two to four hours, and don't start the trails late in the afternoon. It gets dark early there due to the many massive trees more than 100' tall. Do be alert for reptiles on the trail.

Congaree National Park,"Planned our day to arrive around 8 AM knowing the visitors center not open till 9 (bathrooms were open and brochures available). Did the boardwalk loop first. This is a very easy and worthwhile hike especially if you take the brochure and read the info at each marker. Then we hit the visitor center, got some good tips from the staff on other hikes, and then caught the movie. The movie is one of the best we have seen at a national park (and we have been to most of them). Very informative and very well done! Then we opted to do the river hike. It's long, flat, and quite frankly, very boring. What was disappointing was you didn't get to actually walk along the river. Just a glimpse here and there. This was a downer as we expected we would be able to walk along the river for a stretch. In addition, trail maintenance is not a priority here and we spent a lot of time climbing over down trees (which we were previously warned would be occurring). It took us about 4.5 hours to navigate this hike and not sure I would have done it knowing what I do now. Not a very popular hike probably due to its length as we only saw 7 other folks scattered on the trial.","April 4, 2018",A nice smaller national park,467,"Winchester, Virginia",4
Congaree National Park,"This was our 23rd National Park we have visited and Congaree did not disappoint. We began at the visitor center. The rangers there were very friendly and helpful. We looked around at the displays, got our stamp for our passport book, and bought a few postcards. We then took the boardwalk trail, but then got off of that to go on the Weston Lake Loop trail - if you do that be aware that you will miss the middle of the boardwalk loop. I wish we would have went back to see what we missed on the boardwalk loop but the lake loop was interesting to see. We did a glimpse of a couple of turtles and lots of birds along our hikes. The mosquitos were almost non-existent with the weather being a little on the chillier side the day we were there. And the trees, the trees are something to behold. It was very cool to be surrounded by such giants. Be sure to get a self guided tour brochure for the boardwalk loop as it has numbers that coincide with the brochure along the path with fascinating explanations of what you are seeing. Enjoy your hike! ","April 3, 2018",Great day for a hike!,22,"Joliet, Illinois",5
Congaree National Park,"This national park is acres of floodplain encompassing bald cypress, loblolly pine, and dwarf palmetto. Much is accessible by boardwalk (so easy for strollers and wheelchairs), but there are many other easy-moderate trails branching off. We also to the Weston Lake Trail. Lots of woodpeckers. Take time to watch the orientation film in the Visitor's Center, which gives a great overview.

The diversity of trees is nearly as immense as their sizes. Apparently a number of the trees in the park are the tallest specimens of their type. Some are immensely tall while others are tall for their species. Not like western trees, but huge nonetheless. I was really impressed.

Congaree National Park,"We flew into Charlotte in August of 2017 and drove 1.5 hours through the world’s most uninteresting stretch of highway to arrive at Congaree National Park. My fiance and I have been to eight national parks so far and Congaree was easily the worst. The title to another post is “how is this a national park?” and I couldn’t agree more. You could easily find state parks which are more interesting and exciting than what basically amounts to a glorified swamp. Between the giant spiders (which are literally everywhere and if you’re not careful you’ll walk into them) and the bugs, it’s tough to enjoy your surroundings. The boardwalk is a well maintained, easy two mile stretch but there’s not a ton going on.

There are plenty of rest stops and benches along the boardwalk to relax, listen, and observe.We visited in March and were not tortured by mosquitoes at all. Nor did we see any snakes or alligators along the trails. However, we did see numerous bird species, deer, and squirrels. The boardwalk has numbered trail markers with a guide(free at park headquarters)to describe things along the way. There are also scavenger hunt brochures for the kids! Also free. The film at the park headquarters is well done and informative.The ONLY reason I gave the park a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the canoe adventure. You must make reservations WAY in advance since there are only 6 ranger led canoes available. The website says you can follow along with your own canoe but this is no longer an option.To get a full experience of the swamp and see the wildlife of this wilderness, you would need the canoe experience! So make those reservations way ahead of time! From what I hear, May is a great time to go in order to experience the firefly phenomenon. I may have to go back for that and the canoe journey!

We both walked the entire board walk and canoed/camped the Cedar Creek from Cedar Creek landing to Hwy 601 - a two day trip. We loved our entire time in the park. The quiet of the back waters, the pecking of the pileated woodpecker, the enormous call of the barred owl, the otter, the adventure of portaging over enormous downed trees all spoke to the call of adventure and the quiet of being in a peaceful place.","March 12, 2018",Canoeing amidst the Tupelo and Cypress and Champion Trees,39,"Shelbyville, Kentucky",5

We grabbed the self guided tour and headed out on the boardwalk, it was an informative walk. We stopped at each of the numbers and read something about the tree or other history of the area. It was a pretty hike, about 2.4 miles. We did it in about an hour. We also looked at the lake. If we had more time, I would’ve liked to go on the river trail. You can also canoe here. When we finished, the visitor center was open, so we watched the park film before hitting the road, that was nice.

You can enjoy the quiet and be amazed as you gaze at the canopies of trees around 150 feet tall. The boardwalk near the Visitor Center is a great way to see a variety of old growth trees and terrain. The Visitor Center itself has insightful displays on the history and ecology of the park as well as very helpful and nice rangers. Visits in cooler weather help avoid mosquitoes, while spring visits allow for beautiful color and more active wildlife. Kayaking is a favorite activity to plan for.

The 2.5 mile boardwalk would be great for someone with limited mobility as you see the forest, hear the birds,learn about the area and have benches to rest or ponder at regular intervals.

As we were leaving (I'd say walking the last half mile of it), we passed no less than 20 families going in.

Congaree National Park,"The little blond haired boy in a plain yellow t-shirt approached me on tiptoes with his finger over his lips. ""Shhh!...There's an owl"". Sure enough about 60' ahead I spot a group of people on the boardwalk peering off the left side into the trees. I was in Columbia the day before to witness and photograph my first total solar eclipse. And a visit to Congaree seemed like an opportunity not to be missed before heading back South along the I-95. As luck would have it I still had the 150-600mm Tamron lens I had rented for the celestial event. The perfect wildlife lens. I rushed to quietly put it onto my camera. But when I looked up, the crowd was dispersing and making their way along the boardwalk. ""You're too late"" whispered a woman with a large straw sun hat. As I stared dejectedly into the trees mentally willing the owl to re-appear, I see my young friend in the yellow t-shirt from the corner of my eye waving to me to come. She's landed on another tree close by. I trot as quietly as I can along the boardwalk towards the gathering crowd of about 9-10 people. I strain my eyes to see the owl but all I see are leaves and branches. A woman with a pair of binoculars tells me to follow the small tree directly ahead and look for the big branch that is sticking out to the right. I finally see her. And she is beautiful. And she is looking right at me with her big round peering eyes. I ask my binoculared friend what type of owl she thinks it is. She replies ""I don't think, I know it's a juvenile female Barn Owl"".

Trees, spider webs galore, a snake and a snake skin, boardwalks, water - just a general good old time in nature.

Congaree National Park,"Our goal in retirement is to travel all of our National Parks. So far we've visited 36 with Congaree being 37 - so we've been to our fair share of parks. We came here during a recent trip to Beaufort SC and were really looking forward to seeing this park. We stopped at the Visitor Center and the Ranger suggested we take the Weston Lake Loop Trail (#3) Round Trip Distance: 4.4 miles. The brochure says ""This loop trail provides great views of Cedar Creek where otters and wading birds are regularly observed. The eastern portion of this trail follows a cypress -tupelo slough (dried up river bed) where many cypress knees can be seen sticking up out of the water"". NOT! We are fit for our age so we weren't concerned about downed trees, etc. But on the path there would be a tree that was cut to clear the path then 50 feet away there was one that wasn't cut so you had to figure a way around it! We were given some bull that there is a ""conservation act"" that prevents the NP from removing trees using any type of power equipment. Then how were the contractors allowed to use power tools and ATV's? The path was so poorly marked we took a wrong turn and ended up walking about 2 miles longer! Not good for my poor husbands bum knee. The ranger back at the visitor center couldn't have cared less. It may be a free park but to us that's more than it should be. There is a boardwalk trail you can take, so if you REALLY want to go to the park do that; otherwise don't waste your time!","July 17, 2017",Poorly marked - hike at your own risk!,63,"Runaway Bay, Texas",2
Congaree National Park,"We visited Congaree for a day with our kids ages 18 to 9 It was a unique national park - the swamp-like landscape and the hugely tall trees. We walked along the boardwalk trail, which was easy and flat walking and had an interpretive brochure to learn a little more about things, while my kids did their Junior Ranger booklets. The rangers were very friendly and helped give advice. We were a little disappointed that part of the boardwalk trail is currently closed for construction, so instead of doing the full 2+ mile loop, you would have to go twice as far walking each half as an our and back. We just did one portion, which was enough for the kids with the heat and humidity. At least the many trees provided a lot of shade. The mosquitoes were out but not horrible - we didn't use bug spray and were fine. The other things that stands out to me from this park is the spiders - they are huge and there are a lot of them! It was definitely a unique park to visit - we stopped there for a couple hours and were glad we'd made the detour to see it.","July 16, 2017",Unique and uncrowded - but hot in summer!,396,"Portland, Oregon",4

Congaree National Park,"Wow, how did I overlook a national park in my own backyard (less than thirty minutes from my home). The Congaree National Park is in Hopkins which is near Cayce. Recently, I heard a story about a family who got lost in Congaree NP because they decided to venture out by themselves. To make sure that didn't happen to me, I opted for the canoe tour. The canoe tour lasts about 30 minutes (15 minutes going and 15 minutes coming back) down the ""river."" Francy, a USC grad student and Congaree NP volunteer, and her husband led us on the canoe tour. They were individual kayaks and, because the creek was calm, it was easy for us to follow behind them. There were about five people on our tour (me and my little sister included) and two tour guides. On the tour, we saw three snakes and the tour guides were patient as we tried to take pictures of the scenery and animals (just snakes but I've been told they have feral pigs and deer). Francy and her husband were both very knowledgeable of the park and they answered every question I had. I think our canoe tour was the last canoe tour for the season but I'll definitely take a walking tour when it gets cooler.Also, make sure you bring bugspray and sunscreen. I left Congaree National Park with dozens of mosquito bites and two horsefly bites.....ouch!!

I'm not 100% sure that the fireflies were synchronized that Saturday night but we were not disappointed and it was worth the trip. Due to recent flooding much of the paths were under water but we did venture out as far as possible on the boardwalk which for the time of day was plenty. We went back out to the park around 6:30pm to wait for sundown and the fireflies. By 9:30pm the forest was lit up - it was one of the most magical experiences and I'm so glad I could share that with my family.

We did not have a lot of time, and without leaving the boardwalk we saw an owl, pileated woodpecker (new for us), baby turkeys, and many other birds. This park is defiantly worth the time to stop.

Congaree National Park,"We traveled more than 300 miles to visit our #35 National Park on our phenomenal quest. We were certainly not disappointed in the beauty of the swamp, wildlife, flora and conservation mission. We do lament the overall management of the park. This is -- by far - the worst managed of all national parks we've visited. The boardwalks are chock full of people walking multiple dogs...and, some animals were quite aggressive. Dog feces was apparent and the rangers' responses were lackluster after notification. There was no enforcement of any established standards of decency whosoever. The Park's Superintendent even defended such conduct...saying ""the Park is a dog lover's dream."" Well, I do love animals, but NOT on a National Park's trails and boardwalk! And, certainly not if I must carry a weapon to defend myself and family! I'd rather catch a glimpse of a critter or listen to the sounds of the swamp in its clear purity...and in relative safety.Then, when we showed up for the ""walk-on canoe trip,"" some 45-minutes early, we saw them floating away! The ranger there said he felt like they should go early...completely ruining our plans after driving so far. Why follow their own published schedules, right? So, tough luck, I guess.

Only recently in 2003 was Although the old growth bottomland hardwood forest were being logged and fragmented rapidly, Congaree gained National Park status in 2003.About half of the National Park is also a Wilderness Area, which further protects the area by placing certain restrictions on the use and access.Species found in the area include: loblolly pine, sweetgum, cherrybark oak, American elm, swamp chestnut oak, overcup oak, common persimmon, bobcats, deer, feral pigs, feral dogs, coyotes, armadillos, turkeys, amphibians, turtles, snakes, alligators, and many types of fish, including bowfin, alligator gar, and catfish.For a relatively small area, the diversity and different things to do is wonderful. For example, we canoed on the Congaree River which consumes about 50% of the park it seems.Also Congaree offers camping, hiking, fishing and more. There is a boardwalk look that protects the environment and keeps you out of the water.I hope you will visit.

Congaree National Park,"I was traveling from Columbia to Charleston with some friends so we decided to stop at Congaree and do a hike. We did the Weston Lake Loop which was 4.4 miles. I came in with very low expectations, and they were exceeded. The swamp forest is quite lovely. Once we were off the boardwalk, there were some very dicey places on the trail where it was pretty flooded, but we always found a workaround to avoid going ankle deep. Your shoes WILL get muddy though. There are a number of huge trees that have been uprooted (presumably from the hurricane last year) that are really awesome as you can see their entire root system.The park service has ranger led free canoe trips every Friday morning that get rave reviews. We would have loved to do this as we were there on a Friday, but when I checked the website a month ahead of when we were coming, it was already ""sold out."" Not that surprising given it's free (I believe they charge something like a $3 service fee, but still basically free). As I was hiking around, I couldn't help but think that canoe is really the way to see this park. There's nobody to rent canoes from at the park, which means you either have to haul in your own canoe (or pay a company to do so at great expense) or book one of these once a week ranger tours months in advance. This is a big miss by the national park service. My recommendations:1) Offer canoe rentals on site. I'd have happily paid $20 or more to get a canoe for a couple of hours.2) Offer many more ranger led canoe tours. If you had more canoes on site per #1, this becomes much more feasible.3) Charge for the ranger led canoe tours if necessary to support the increased staffing.This way, the park can still be free to those who want to hike, but you're providing an important service for those willing to pay to meet the demand for canoeing that clearly exceeds the current supply.","May 8, 2017","Enjoyable hike, wish more people could canoe",75,"Chicago, Illinois",3

The water we saw in the park was not moving rapidly, so I don't believe rushing water or fast currents played a part. Since this was supposed to be ranger led, we would have thought that they could still have taken a group out on the water as experienced guides. Instead, we walked the trails and boardwalk.

On the trail, we saw A red-shouldered hawk, two pileated woodpeckers, two squirrels, and six white-tailed deer. There were only five tourists besides us. The Harry Hampton Visitor Center had a fun Junior Ranger Program and fantastic exhibits. If you plan to take a vacation in Columbia, put some time aside for this underrated (yet awesome) park.","January 9, 2017",Far Beyond Expectations,24,"Cape Coral, Florida",5

The staff in the visitor center was polite, helpful and extremely personable. During the summer months and rainy season, much of the area is flooded, which is what creates such a wonderful environment. Wish more people would visit.

Congaree National Park,"This park is not far from Columbia, SC and seems very popular. There was a huge parking area but it was almost full! . Bring bug spray as the Mosquito's are relentless and bottled water. There is a small visitors center with restrooms. From the VC is a boardwalk extending over 2 miles long. They have a brochure with numbered points of interest and a description of each. Off the boardwalks are other trails that weave thru the swamps and trees. You can also Canoe and Kayak here. There is 2 campgrounds also. All the trails are extremely well marked and easy to follow on the map you get at the VC. A very interesting place for a desert dweller like myself!

The park is a designated wilderness area and if you have the time, there are some great trail hikes. Also, canoeing and kayaking is available. We will be back.

Congaree National Park,"We visited here October, 2016 after a few days in Great Smoky National Park. They had a ton of trees blown down due to the recent hurricane. They were cleaning up and repairing the boardwalk even as we were there. Many of the trails were closed. We hiked the Sims trail and were able to connect to the Oakridge Trail. We had to climb over and hike around dozens of downed trees. The trail looked like it wasn't a very well hiked trail even though it is one of the few hikes in the park. We had to constantly search for the trail. Luckily there are trail markers consistently placed on the trees. There are a number of old growth trees on this hike as well as many bridges to cross. One bridge was damaged by a tree and required climbing to get down. Most of the mess should be cleaned up before winter. This is a fairly small national park, but good to see that it has been protected. If you like to hike you might able to spend a couple days here at the most. They have a nice visitors center with a great movie highlighting the park. Be aware that this park floods about 10 times each year, but the newest sections of boardwalk appear to be tall enough so that you could still get a good feel for the park. If you are in the area, give it a visit. ","October 26, 2016","Small, but interesting",186,"Waukesha, Wisconsin",3

Congaree National Park,"I'm a SC native,but I've lived the last five years as an expat. Upon returning home, I was dying to visit this area to photograph it. Upon my arrival I found it clean and safe with a small welcome center with a gift shop. I'm not sure if it's my age or I just picked the wrong the day to go, but personally I see no reason to ever return. I found it to be more for people with kids or dog walkers. Very little to see when you have kids screaming and yelling on the pathways. Lots of dog walkers and dog poop on the walkways. I'm not saying I'm against kids, or dogs I'm just wanted to state please bare all this in mind based on what your wanting or expecting to get out of us this trip. Please wear bug spray. Beautiful trees, nice little swamp, and I did see a small squirrel.","October 6, 2016",It depends on what you are expecting,29,"Las Salinas, Nicaragua",3
Congaree National Park,"I went to Congaree on a solo hike this past week. It was a wonderful experience, with a few caveats. The boardwalk section of the trail (over 2 miles) is great. However, I did the full river trail (10 miles in total). This was a mistake. Lots of the backwood trails are overgrown and covered with spider webs, tick-infested weeds, and other unpleasant pests. I used half a can of backwoods DEET and I was still being attacked by mosquitos. I also ran into a golden orb weaver web, and was bitten on my forehead. I developed a knot on my forehead from the spider bite about the size of a golf ball in a matter of hours. I wasn't concerned about my health based on what I had read, but it was still an unpleasant experience. I just popped some antihistamines and was fine.I also saw a cottonmouth and an unidentified snake with a triangular head (probably a copperhead). DO NOT ALLOW YOUR DOGS OFF-LEASH ON THE BACK TRAILS OR THEY WILL GET BIT BY A SNAKE!!On the plus-side, I did see some wild hogs and piglets on the back trail.I would not recommend the back trails during the summer unless you're VERY comfortable with roughing it. The boardwalks are great, but I won't do any more backwood trails at Congaree until the winter months.Overall, I highly recommend this park. Boardwalk is great year-round, but back trails are winter-only.","September 24, 2016","Beautiful national park, but don't forget it's a swamp",4,"Sautee Nacoochee, Georgia",5

Congaree National Park,"On August 25 I was part of the enthusiastic crowd that gathered at the park to help celebrate the 100th birthday of the National Park Service and the 40th anniversary of Congaree National Park. Highlight features included a big tree hike, a ranger talk on NPS history, a video about the park, and a big birthday cake. Among the special invitees in attendance were retired ranger Fran Rametta (the legendary “owl prowl” guy) and a gaggle of the park’s “founding fathers/mothers” most notably Jim Elder, Dick Watkins and John Cely. This was a very inspiring event, making me prouder than ever that we’ve got “Redwoods East” right here in central South Carolina. Kudos to the park’s staff and volunteers for being such gracious hosts. Clarification: The main events celebrating the park’s 40th anniversary will be held in October.

We picked up a map with tons of information at the visitors center. I came away refreshed and renewed. The boardwalk goes through the forest that was once used by slaves as they escaped their owners. You will see interesting plants, an old moonshine still and wildlife while on this walk of two to three miles. My favorite was the twisted trunks of the trees. It was truly an amazing sight.

We saw some HUGE trees, a Midland's Green Rat Snake, some small skinks, a decent sized skink, and some HUGE Golden Silk Spiders. The hike was humid but mostly shaded and in the hottest part of a July day. We enjoyed our trip to this park but the ranger station is a little lacking. The station looks big on the outside but it really isn't that large of a room and the gift shop was lacking the one thing I wanted for my boys which was a sew on patch of the park.

Congaree National Park,"We had a great walk on the boardwalk and a very nice experience with park staff. We saw amazing trees and a lot of good birds and lizards. We expected heat and humidity, and we should have expected that our wished-for kayak tour of the park wouldn't be able to go in the low water of late July. What we didn't expect was the complete lack of cabins, food, hotels, groceries or anything in the near vicinity of the park. Columbia is close, but we don't go to national parks to spend our time driving around in city traffic. We rented cabins at Poinsett State Park, which were wonderful, but we ended up driving to Sumter for meals and groceries. I'd say at this point it is a park with a lot of potential, but two days in July were more than enough time for this park.","July 24, 2016",Amazing boardwalk,5,,4

There is a 2.4 mile hike on a boardwalk trail, although part of it was inaccessible due to a tree that had fallen. Even with an injured foot, this was a smooth hike through the beautiful forest. I especially enjoyed the boardwalk trail that was raised, because you could really see all around and we saw some wonderful sights. Make sure that you take bug spray with you because it is a swamp area, and even though the National Park's mosquito meter was at a one, they were still everywhere.

The GPS also does some weird things, taking you on a cross-country trip through the backstreets, so be careful.The Congaree National Park is a small cypress forest, thankfully saved from development and logging in the seventies. They have a well-done and very attractive visitor's center, and then a couple of miles hiking trail on a boardwalk behind the center. It's nice, it's peaceful.

Congaree National Park,"Congaree is a beautiful small national park with wonderful old-growth trees, a nice little visitors' center, and some neat hikes. However, the park is surrounded by private, rural land, especially in the visitors' center area. While taking a peaceful hike on the boardwalk behind the center, we could hear the ""pop pop pop"" of nearby residents target shooting or hunting feral pigs or other game. We didn't know how far away the shots were, so the threat of stray bullets undermined the peace and solitude of the place. Out of an abundance of caution, we cut our visit short. Even the ranger admitted that the sound of gunfire was a pretty common occurrence. Definitely a place worth visiting, but, hopefully, the NPS will work on purchasing additional surrounding land as a buffer because, even though guns are not allowed in the park, the guns are apparently right next door.","July 9, 2016",Beautiful but marred by the sounds of gunfire in the distance.,35,florida,4

It is difficult to find old growth forests anymore and Congaree gives you a chance to experience the majesty of champion trees. The area is actually a flood basin, not a swamp, because it does dry out between flooding. I have heard the barred owls, seen deer and woodpeckers here also.

With this being the 100th anniversary for the Park System, we decided to visit here on our way to Charleston, SC. We spent 2-3 hours at the park. It is nothing Spectacular like some of the Parks out west, but it certainly is worth a visit. The Park is located in the lowlands where Rivers overflow and water gathers in the springtime. We walked the 2 1/2 mile Boardwalk. The Palmetto and Cypress Trees were plentiful. Watch the brief video before the hike so you know what you can see and look for. The staff are friendly and helpful and the Park is a lovely serene place. The rangers explained to us that in May the fireflies ""sync"" and all light up at the same time in the evening at the park. They said it is quite an attraction and kids as well as adults really enjoy it!!!We were just passing through so we could not stay for the evening ""show"" but if we return we definitely will do so.

Congaree National Park,"This is a small (by national park standards) but very nice park. The 2.2 mile boardwalk is wonderful with 20 stops to observe various items. About 1/3 of it is newly renovated (and completed as of late May 2016). The story is interesting. We went on a very rainy day so we didn't explore beyond the boardwalk. Be prepared for bugs. We went on a day where the mosquito meter is at a ""2"" out of 6. We were not bothered by mosquitos but we had deer fly buzzing around us, which is very annoying. Since it's low land swamp, it will flood regularly so check for conditions before you go to make sure it's not flooded. There is ranger led canoe trip on Fridays for free, as well as ranger led hikes.The park is FREE! Did I say the park is FREE?

Unfortunately, the ranger was not willing to take us even if someone didn't show up. The trees with the ""knees"" are really cool. We saw an owl. It was very hot but you sort of get wrapped up in the tour and forget about the heat.

Congaree National Park,"Congaree National Parks protects the largest tract of old-growth bottomland hardwood forest in North America. The park is home to some of the largest trees of their kind in North America. It is a birder's paradise with 170 documented species, a botanist's dream with more than 80 tree species and a river rat's playground with 60 reptile and amphibian and 49 fish species surveyed in the park. We arrived in Congaree in the afternoon. We checked in at the newly built visitor center to see if our canoe trip the next day was still on and it was. There is no entry fee for this park. We checked out the displays and watched the video about the park and the forest it protects. We still had time so we took the Self-guided Boardwalk Tour. The boardwalk begins just behind the visitor center. Be sure to pick up the very informative tour pamphlet. As you stroll the 2.4 mile boardwalk look for numbers corresponding to the guide. Along the walk we saw numerous birds and three deer. Check with the rangers, in May one portion of the boardwalk was under repair so you needed to take a detour on the Sims trail which shortens the walk. Unlike the boardwalk, Sims trail is not wheelchair accessible. The ranger-led canoe trip is held Friday, Saturday and Sunday. There is no fee for this adventure but space is limited to 12 people. Register online. We planned our three days in the park around this canoe trip. Ranger Patrick Hair met us at the visitor center to give the group a safety briefing and get everyone who didn't have their own personal flotation device fitted for one. Starting time for the briefing is 9:30. Don't be late, it cuts into to creek time. Once briefed and fitted, everyone goes back to their vehicles to follow the rangers and volunteers down to Cedar Creek. Once there, participants help unload canoes and carry them down to the creek. There is a rest room at the launch site. The ranger recommended everyone go before they went. There are no pit stops on the creek. By the time we were ready to go it was 10:30. The creek is loaded with tannin from trees in and along the creek giving the water a deep brown color. It was like floating in chocolate. Most of the sounds were birds and the lapping of paddles. It was magic. We floated and paddled for two hours. We saw a couple snakes and a pileated woodpecker. The trees are so tall the birds are mostly hidden in the high branches. Once back at the launch site, canoes were beached and we helped get the equipment back to the Ranger Hair's trailer. Although not advertised, there are half-hour canoe trips later in the afternoon if staff is available. Once again, space is limited. This was the highlight of our trip to Congaree and we would absolutely do it again. After our canoe trip we hiked the Weston Lake Loop Trail . This is an easy 4.4 mile walk that begins and ends on the Boardwalk. If you did the canoe trip, this is an opportunity to see Cedar Creek from the shore. On our last day in the park we hiked the Oakridge Trail which is 6.6 miles long. Because the park is relatively flat the hike made for an easy walk in the woods. The big draw for us was the wildlife. In addition to animals we had seen previously, we saw river otter, turtles and water moccasins. Check with the rangers before you take this hike. Rains could make some parts of the trail difficult to travel.The start and end of the three trails we hiked overlap, so if you are limited on the amount of time you have to spend in the park chart the longest hike time allows and go for it. The park publishes a trail map that will help make your decisions. If you only have time for one hike we would suggest the Oakridge Trail. It covers a little of everything the park had to offer.While Congaree doesn't have the vistas of the Grand Canyon National Park or the majesty of Rocky Mountain National Park, it has a it's own unique subtle beauty that reveals itself quietly to anyone who is willing to spend the time to venture into the forest.","June 2, 2016",Hike and Canoe in a Giant Tree Forest,498,"Phoenix, Arizona",5
Congaree National Park,"We wanted to see the display of the synchronous fireflies which only happens for two or three weeks out of the year. We arrived at the park during the daylight and walked the 2.4 mile loop in perfect peace and solitude. The old growth trees were incredible and the circumference of some of the trees was quite impressive. There are numbered markers and an informative pamphlet at the visitor center that explains what is being seen at each marker. Pamphlets are provided outside of the building if the center is closed and during the summer, there is plenty of daylight left after the center closes. As darkness descended, we were able to see many of the fireflies as they began their synchronized light show, but it was a very small display. I think we were there after the week of the peak display. We still enjoyed watching them flying throughout the bushes and into the tree tops. There were five adults in total and we all agreed this was a great visit and look forward to visiting the park again.","May 31, 2016",Beautiful Park,20,"New Orleans, Louisiana",5

Congaree National Park,"This is well worth at least one day of a stop, if not two. There are lots of good hiking trails. There was a free canoo trip the day I went. There is a suspended boardwalk over a swamp area behind the visitor's center that you can walk for a long time and look down on the amphibious wild life. My only complaint is that I did not have more time there. Excellent!","May 25, 2016",Excellent,20,"Long Beach, California",5
Congaree National Park,"Huge Thanks to Scott who was enthusiastic on the phone when I called to inquire about the event. We had driven through South Carolina a couple of times and did spend a few days at Santee a number of years ago. But haven't considered it a destination until we started looking for a National Park to visit. Last fall we spent 6 days at the Smoky Mountain National Park - yes of course we fell in love! Congaree Nat'l Park iyhs really something else. We have never encountered such energetic and informative Park Rangers. You could not pass one of these Rangers without hearing about something else there was to do in the Park. And because of the event, there were so many volunteers and happy faces - well very uplifting.The speakers were outstanding - not only were they outgoing in their talks - they seemed to go out looking for opportunities to connect to the children and folks attending. The man who was John James Audubon never left character and he was informative on not just the birds, their calls, and characteristics, but all things Forest. I was fortunate to walk on a short hike with him and a great ranger, and get to see him in action - not just on stage. He dressed the character and walked the walk.You could not imagine a more real Rachael Carson. My husband Theo was a chemical sales man for Dow Chemical in her hay days was totally intrigued. We understand parks across the nation participated and our only thought was we might have missed it all if not for Scott.","May 23, 2016",Wonderful Birding Event 'Bioblitz16',20,"Jacksonville, Florida",5

No biking, no horseback riding but if you like quiet hikes from 2-12 miles on well maintained trails--visit and enjoy this place. You will see bald cypress trees and loblolly pine well over 100 feet tall. You will hear an amazing symphony of song birds. You will love the still beauty of this forest.

Congaree National Park,"This is not what you think of as a typical National Park. It has the Rangers, a visitor's center, board walks and guides, but it's very small and (unless you arrange or meet a given tour) it's mostly an on-your-own sort of experience. That said, it's all totally FREE (find that in another NP!) and I enjoyed learning more about the nature of the area, the trees and local history. I was sad so many great old growth had been destroyed in Hugo. It must have been amazing to see. October is by far the best time to visit, but only due to the mosquito count. Definitely bring repellent with you between April and September...and USE IT! The staff were VERY friendly and eager to provide assistance in the visitor's center. That was nice.","May 17, 2016",Not what you think of as a typical National Park,10,"Morehead, Kentucky",4
Congaree National Park,We visited this park on a Sunday. It was sort of busy. The weather was just right- about 75 degrees. The visitor center is very friendly and helpful. The boardwalk trail is a good way to see the normal flora and environment. We took a canoe trip with the ranger on a creek off of the Congaree River. That was very nice. We saw lots of nice wetlands and about 15 snakes! It was a very relaxing way to enjoy nature and your family. My little girl did the junior ranger program and she learned a lot. I think it is a good way to spend a half to a full day with family. There are detours on Hwy 48 right now- so follow the signs.,"May 16, 2016",Great way to relax,98,"Branchville, South Carolina",4
Congaree National Park,"CONGAREE NATIONAL PARK features lakes, streams, and hiking trails. Although there is a boardwalk, most of the trails are on dry land. Initially, visitors will encounter Weston Lake and the trail that boarders the northern edge of the lake. Photographers will be thrilled by the strangely shaped tree formations found along the northern edge of the lake, as well as in the shallow areas at the eastern most and western most corners of the lake. These shallow waters enable the photographer to wade out into the water and capture astonishing photographs of oddly contorted trees and the reflections in surrounding waters. To digress slightly, one of my favorite artists is Richard Estes, a photorealist painter who specializes in reflections within windows in New York City. Congaree Swamp enables the photographer to convert himself to a photo-version of Richard Estes. I am not sure if anybody has named the trees, but the following names indicate the variety of weirdly conformed trees: (1) Heart tree. This tree is located at east corner of Weston Lake; (2) Shelf tree. This tree has an inexplicable wooden shelf extending out from the trunk. The shelf is like a large human hand, and a little plant grows on the shelf; (3) Hermaphrodite tree. This tree had a large male thingee that extends downwards, and immediately below the base of the male thingee is a large crevice in the trunk resembling a female thingee; (4) Monkey clown tree. About ten feet up on the trunk of this tree is a symmetrical growth that resembles a clown with puffy cheeks; (5) Plumbing tree. This is a symmetrical array of roots from a tree, resembling plumbing pipes, that inexplicably comes out of the ground and forms a couple of complete loops, and then goes back into the ground. The plumbing tree takes the form of roots only, and is not associated with any tree trunk; (6) Curly ear tree. This tree is located in the shallow water area at the western corner of Weston Lake. Great photos of the curly ear tree can be taken at dawn and at dusk, but at dawn the photos are more mysterious.The Congaree Swamp has two personalities. The first is when the swamp is wet and the other is when it is dry. When completely dry, the trees take on a gray color, and hikers will be able to examine up close the strangely conformed trees. When in the wet state, photographers and others will be thrilled by Mother Nature's compositions taking the form of arrays of parallel shadows on the water's surface and of reflections from the surrounding forest.During my six visits to Congaree Swamp, I only saw a snake once. It was a corn snake (harmless snake). I never encountered a water moccasin, copperhead, or alligator, despite the fact that I hiked all of the trails, and despite going off trail on many occasions. This is not to suggest that hikers throw caution to the wind.I visited Congaree Swamp on six occasions, five times with my Olympus OM4 camera and once with my Tachihara 4X5 camera with Schneider lenses. I printed my 4X5 images, resulting in a portfolio of 20 inch by 24 inch color prints. I had my negatives scanned, resulting in a 400MB file for each scan. My swamp portfolio of about 20 prints was exhibited on the main floor of Lawrence Hall of Science in Berkeley, CA. Congaree Swamp has had a continuing emotional appeal to me.","May 13, 2016",Excellent for amazing photography of reflections in water and of bizarre trees,349,"Berkeley, California",5
Congaree National Park,"The last time I visited the Congaree was twenty years ago when it was a National Monument. Not much has changed except that the visitor center is new. The boardwalk is a good way to see the large trees and the swamp areas. At the time of our visit, repairs to one section of the boardwalk were not completed so we walked on the Sims trail which was not quite as interesting as the boardwalk. On a cool day there was not the insect activity you might expect on a much warmer day.","May 13, 2016",Second visit,158,georgia,3
Congaree National Park,"Getting to the park was a bit difficult due to roads closed and detour signs. If it wasn't for GPS, we probably wouldn't have made it. I had checked the website beforehand and understood the potential for flooding, but nothing had been updated in regards to part of the boardwalk trail being underwater. The Park Rangers at the visitor center were very kind, but not knowledgeable of some of the trails listed in the park, but outside of the direct vicinity of the center. The part of the boardwalk we were able to do was easy and beautiful. The Weston Lake Trail was a decent hike- could have used a bit more warning up front about the amount of snakes for those who aren't locals. The Bates Ferry Trail is portrayed as a loop trail of 2.2 mi. This was the most disappointing. Not only was it hard to find, the Rangers were unable to give us specific directions, and the trail itself was tire tracks through the woods to the Congaree river. Overall, the park is beautiful, but compared to the other National Parks, it is not worth seeing more than once. ","May 8, 2016",Not Worth Seeing Twice,0,,3
Congaree National Park,"Not knowing what to expect at this park we were very happy we stopped. The visitor center was very nice, the movie informative and the rangers very helpful.

Today was a mild 85degF, with mostly sunshine during our walk- not crowded, with perhaps just a hundred or so tourist like us.The tall trees and green shades were magnificent. During our walk, we saw a turtle, several green and orange/brown lizards, squirrels, colorful birds and dragonflies.The walking paths were nicely setup with evenly spaced out park benches for stops. We did not get off the paths to do the Bush trails, as they appeared very muddy and wet.The Rangers at the Visitor Centre were terrific and helpful with information.There are restrooms at the campsites just up the road.","May 5, 2016",Nice Wetland National Park,197,"Melbourne, Australia",5

Congaree National Park,"I hiked here during a visit to Columbia. The Weston Lake Trail (4.4 miles) includes most of the boardwalk plus a trail out along the bank of a creek. I live near a river that has great hiking on its banks, and what I enjoyed most about Congaree was being surrounded by 130' trees and birdsong. I saw a lot of lizards skittering around, as well as a great blue heron in flight and a tiny little snake on the trail. I heard a pair of red-shouldered hawks calling too.The park infrastructure is small compared to the huge national parks, but you can easily experience much of the park in a few hours. On a weekday in April, I passed maybe a dozen people on the boardwalk but nobody else on the trail. Definitely worth a visit if you're in town.

We did see many types of birds, butterflies, saw tracks from deer, and others. There are many types of Champion trees here, both nationally and state wide. This park has a lot of researchers come from all over the world, and sometimes the park holds talks on the current research projects. It can get hot and buggy, so bring spray and plenty of water to drink. The park also have plenty of programs such as ranger led hikes, kayaking, and more. The Nature center has a few nice exhibits, and a nice 18min movie about the park and it's history. Bathrooms are really clean. I went with a group of friends, but will def return with my family.

The visitors center is clean and well appointed, and the rangers and volunteers are ready to answer questions. Best of all, there is a well-marked canoe trail through the swamp on Cedar Creek. We put in at Bannister bridge and took out about six miles downstream at the parking lot. Check the USGS water level before paddling, as the trail spreads out in the swamp and may be confusing above 7 feet, as measured at Cedar Creek. There are mile markers every quarter mile on the water. Bring your own canoe or kayak, or sign up in advance for a free equipment-provided session offered by the park.

Congaree National Park,"My girlfriend and I took a trip to the Congaree National Park awhile back and it was a very pleasant experience! We had been looking for something recreational that was new, fun, and active to do, so when we found out about the park on Columbia’s CVB website, we decided to make the short trip from Columbia to the park for a nature discovery walk. Admission for the park and tour was free, so as college students it was the perfect activity for us.The Nature Discovery Walk was very relaxed, informative, and overall a very satisfying time. We joined a park volunteer on a walk around part of the park, which started at the visitor center and went around the entire boardwalk. We walked at a very leisurely pace while the volunteer explained interesting facts about the habitat, animal life, and plant life to us. Even though we went on the Nature Walk, there were other people who rode their bicycles throughout the boardwalk and trails. The boardwalk is even stroller and wheelchair accessible which makes it perfect for any kind of visitor!The employees there were another great part about the Congaree National Park. From the moment we got to the visitors center we were serviced with the utmost care and respect! The woman we spoke to at the front desk was extremely informative about anything and everything in the park. She helped us pick out what trails to walk on, what we should bring with us, the length of the trails, and even hooked us up with bug spray to keep those pesky insects off of us! Furthermore, she took us around the gallery inside and explained to us the kinds of animals, insects, birds, plant life, and general habitat there. The employee that helped us at the visitor center gave us the best service we could have asked for and is one of the reasons we tell our friends to visit the park for themselves! Along with that, the tour guide was also very knowledgeable, caring, and overall fun person who made what could easily have been a boring tour into an exciting one. Although the canoe tour was unavailable when we went there, they made the nature walk into an enjoyable and memorable tour. The service at this park is outstanding and I highly recommend going on a visit for yourself! Overall, the tour had an extremely positive impact on me. I have since become environmentally conscious of the natural habitat around South Carolina, namely the Congaree National Park Region. I am pleased with the amount of things I learned about the animals, plant life, and habitat there. Before I had no idea about some of the animals that lived in those woods and I was amazed at the diversity of the habitat there. I’ve now been there a few times, and it is incredible to see how much the water levels change during different times of the year. However, my favorite part of the Park is the serene view you get on the boardwalk over the lake there.My friends and I used to be hesitant to try and go out and do things because most things we could think of doing required a lot of money, but since visiting here our perspectives have shifted. Now, we love going to recreational places like this to go hiking, biking, and simply just relaxing out in nature which is completely free to do! All you need is your friends and you’re set to go have a wonderful time. The Congaree National Park itself is fantastic in this nature not only because of its accessibility to us frugal students, but because of the preservation and teaching of the park to both its local and out-of-state visitors. The people here do an amazing service for the community that I praise them with the highest respect. This is definitely a great place for people looking for nature tourism, as well as ecotourism. If you don’t believe me, go visit the park and see for yourself!","September 8, 2015",Amazing National Park Experience,5,"Columbia, South Carolina",5

We had no idea that an old growth forest of this magnitude still existed in the area. The park rangers were all very friendly and engaging. The new movie in the visitors center was very informative. The best part of a visit here is taking the boardwalk trails into the pristine wilderness area.It is a bit tricky to find, but well worth the effort.

Congaree National Park,"I'm sure many people do not realize this National Park in South Carolina, but this in one folks should try to visit. First off, realize that the park is based in flood plain and showcases the bio-diversity of this area. Yes, it is moist and swampy. Yes there are bugs. Plan your trip accordingly. Bug spray is a must along with water. But with that said, the trails offer a variety of hiking for those wanting to view this forest area. The boardwalk trail provides an easy walk through the old growth forest. We visited in July and part of the boardwalk was closed due to storm damage. Yes, large trees do fall in the forest and that is part of the charm of the hiking. There are other longer trails to hike that can provide anywhere from a 90 minute to 4 or 5 hour tour. We did the Weston Lake trail to circle back to the boardwalk. Overall about 2 1/2 hours with great views of the forest. We finished up with the visitor center and the movie. it's not often that you can get history of a National Park that was identified and created in our lifetime.

Congaree National Park,This is a beautiful old growth forest - the last of it's kind in the south. We walked as much of the boardwalk trail as was open.

Congaree National Park,"Went there for our NP bucket list. We were there on a weekday, and wasn't very busy. The visitor center was our first stop - a beautiful facility. The rangers were very helpful in helping us determine what hike to do. We had our dog, and came from NY so we wanted to see as much as possible. We hiked the boardwalk, and all the way down the Sims Trail to the River trail onto the sand bar. On the way back we did the Oakridge up the Weston Lake Loop Trail. The park was full of wildlife. We saw about 30 wild pigs on the entirety of our hike, many with little piglets. Evidence of their presence was everywhere with the upturned ground and torn apart logs. We also saw several turtles, a tortoise, some snakes, lots of birds - in general lots of wildlife. We loved it! The only wildlife we didn't love was the mosquito which were just shy of war zone on the meter scale. We had to reapply our bug spray almost every hour. By the river it wasn't too bad with a breeze, but it was a decent hike to get there. Luckily we didn't get any poison ivy. I'm not sure how prevalent it is in the park, but I saw it on one of the jr. ranger pamphlets so knowing it was there kept me on high alert to the point that I saw leaves of three everywhere! Given we all walked out without poison ivy, I've already recommend this NP to anyone who is interested. The giant trees left us awe struck. Definitely a highlight of our road trip.","June 3, 2015",Loved it!,11,"Syracuse, New York",5

Make sure you get a park brochure and detailed trail guide before you start your walk, there are numbers along the board walk and the guide has very detailed explanations. There are also interactive guides for kids. The first half mile or so isn't very exciting but keep walking and you'll be amazed by the beauty in this forest. The bald cypress trees are a sight to be seen! There are benches throughout, sit down and listen to nature.

Congaree National Park,"Congaree was unlike any other national park I have been to. Being from the northeast, I had never seen a landscape Congaree. Park of the elevated boardwalk was shut down, due to storm damage, but there was still plenty of boardwalk and trails to walk. We even saw a couple of wild pigs and several small piglets! The visitor center has a short film that the rangers are happy to show at visitors' request. The film (about 20 minutes if I remember correctly) is worth the short time it takes to view it. The rangers are also happy to answer any questions, and they have a good amount of educational literature/pamphlets, including a self-guided tour of key sites along the boardwalk.We also camped in the park, and the campsites were good sized and comfortable. (Note: the bathroom facilities at the campground consist of just pit toilets, although the building does have electric lights. The handicapped bathroom outside the visitor center, with running water, is open all night.) Camping is first come, first serve, and being a weeknight in February, there were only 3 occupied sites, including our own.

In one direction it was flooded over and impassable for us. The other direction had some kind of construction. And just our luck, the visitor center is closed Monday. So it ended up being a quick visit.The scenery we did get to see was very interesting. The forest floor was flooded like a mangrove swamp but instead of short little trees there are huge talk hundreds of year old trees. Many hiking trails and would be a great place to canoe or kayak if you want.

This April day with mild temps was a perfect time to explore the Congaree Park....humidity as well as bugs were at a minimum. I have to believe that a summer day here would be brutal.Large Loblolly pines, Cyprus and Tupelo trees as well as varied undergrowth made the walk interesting.

You may want to call the park office before visiting to find out which trails are flooded and which trails are open. This is a watershed area / flood plain. There is a boardwalk which is slippery after it rains so be careful. The bridges along the trail are slippery as well after they get wet so be real careful - someone in our hiking party slipped and fell, but was okay. There are stubbly pointed trees called ""knees"" which I have never seen anywhere else. We saw a feral pig and a spider the size of your hand and heard owls hooting to each other.You may want to visit the Nature Center first and watch the movie to get an idea of how different this park is from the others. The Nature Center also has snacks available and a gift shop. There was a slight mist in the air when we hiked because of the rain. I am sure this place is also really beautiful on a sunny day and in the Fall. Even the fallen/dead trees look different here. I posted some photos.Between the bathrooms at the Nature Center there is a mosquito gauge. I hear during the summer months it can be brutal with the bugs.

There aren't a lot of trails but the ones that they do have are worth your time. They wind you through the swamp and the scenery is what you think of when you think of South Carolina. The tall trees mixed in with the swamp really commands your attention and really gives you a sense of peace. One of the trails is an elevated boardwalk if you want to enjoy the scenery but don't want to get your shoes dirty.

From there we started out on our hike, initially on the boardwalk and then onto the Oakridge Trail. Be sure to talk to the ranger at the Visitors Center and ask the condition of the trails, as they are often wet and muddy.While we did not see any alligators, wild hogs or deer we did see a lot of birds including an owl, have a turkey gobble near us, see fish and turtles swimming, and enjoy many very large trees. The swamp had water in it when we visited but not enough to make anything impassable. As I looked around at the terrain I kept wondering if Yoda would be around the next corner sitting on a log, as it reminded me of Dagobah in The Empire Strikes Back. The hike was very easy as the terrain is quite flat, but I would recommend hiking boots so you don't get too wet or muddy if you venture off the boardwalk.An easy afternoon, I would recommend stopping here if you want to see some of the last old growth forest in the eastern US.","March 27, 2015",A most interesting old growth swamp.,61,"Holland, Michigan",5

Congaree National Park,"In the southeast we are light on national parks. So on a trip out west, we were excited by the prospect of a close-by national park, a mere four hours from our home in Raleigh. At first glance coming into the park and to the visitor center, we were reminded of coming into an average state park. But the visitor center is informative and is the jump-off point for a 2.5 mile walk on a boardwalk. The trip on it reminded us a little of the hike we had a few years ago into the old-growth forest of Olympic National Park. This is, we are told, the last remaining old growth decidous hardwood forest in the U.S. The trees here are towering up to 135 feet or so. Among them are tupleo, bald cypress, and loblolly pine. The cypress are surrounded by ""knees"" that seemed like a forest of gnomes. Quite strange and interesting. Part of the high boardwalk (the river here can flood this area up to 12 feet, so I would call ahead before visiting) was closed as it was damaged by the recent ice storm. This is a floodplain swamp. I understand that in parts of the year there are ranger lead canoe trips through it although right now the park is struggling with staffing. This is a habitat for the barred owl, which we heard but did not see, and the piliiated woodpecker. We did see a family of feral hogs, a small snake, and several large turtles.","March 24, 2015",Small but interesting,692,"Raleigh, North Carolina",4
Congaree National Park,"One of the newest national parks, and nothing overly dramatic, but well worth the time. Easy walking trails from 2 to 10 miles (the first two on a boardwalk) are a nice introduction to the park, which is sometimes erroneously called a swamp, which it is not, but it is a seasonal flood plain.Do check the website for the free canoe trips, available Saturdays only. Led by a ranger, you paddle down (and back up) the Congaree River, surrounded by birds, turtles, the rarely seen deer or wild hog. Keep your voice down and your eyes open. Park provides (again, free!) boats, paddles and PFD's (life vests). Takes about 3 hours, at least 2 of which is on the water.","March 23, 2015",Free ranger led canoe trips.

Congaree National Park,"You can be excused if you have never heard the name ""Congaree National Park,"" it is not one of the most well-known of the US National Park System. But you may not be excused if you are in central South Carolina area and fail to visit this unusual park. The park was previously known as Congaree Swamp National Monument. Reclassified as a national park and dropping the word ""swamp"" from its name increased some of its popularity but it is still nevertheless a relatively less visited park. That is a shame, because Congaree offers something that no other park does.The swamps create an unusual landscape where the trees come out of water. The best way to visit the park is probably with a canoe. The National Park Service offers free guided tours but they have to be booked ahead of time. If you miss that, then the next best thing to do is just to walk on the 2.5 mile long boardwalk loop, which rewards you with interesting vistas. As of this writing, however, the ""elevated"" boardwalk (about 1/4 of the total loop) is closed due to ""structural damage."" Check before you go.I visited the park in March. Warm enough to be pleasant, cold enough for mosquitoes to be around, so it is a perfect time. if you go any other time, make sure to have ample mosquito protection. There is no fee to enter this national park (unlike most other national parks), but the visitors center is closed on Sundays.If you are in South Carolina, make sure to visit this most unusual park. I drove for almost three hours - each way - on a day trip from Hilton Head Island, and I have no regrets. It is one of the most interesting parks I have seen.

Congaree National Park,"I recently camped for a weekend at Congaree Nat'l Park with a group of Cub Scouts. The group sites in the Longleaf camp area are large, flat and plenty of firewood available in the surrounding woods. We hiked about 8 miles on the Low Boardwalk, Oakridge Trail, Weston Lake Loop then the Sims Trail. There are MASSIVE trees on the Oakridge Trail that are more than worth the trek. We saw a mother and 3 young wild boar and a large percentage of the trail area was heavily rooted by boar. A ranger said recent high water has pushed them into the area at high numbers than normal. The trails are well marked and maintained but it is a swamp so certain areas are wetter than others so a phone call to the park is a good idea to check on trail conditions. My only negative is there is NOT potable water in the campground, which is why I did not rate it excellent. The only water is a spigot at the visitors center. We knew this beforehand so packed in water for the trip. There is 1 male and 1 female toilet in the campground in the form of a composting toilet house next to the parking area. There are only (4) group sites and about (10) individual sites which are all first come first serve so get there early. There are strict guidelines on firewood so read them carefully on the website. During the warmer months there will be poisonous snakes, alligators, mosquitos and other bugs so I recommend cooler months. That is why we braved freezing temperatures to avoid the other things. Overall it was an awesome trip and the Scouts loved it.

Congaree National Park,"Congaree National Park, formerly Congaree Swamp National Monument, is South Carolina's only National Park. The park encompasses the largest intact area of bottomland hardwood forest in the southeastern United States. Frequent flooding of Congaree River brings in rich nutrients and fosters great diversity of plant and animal life. It also has a lot of very big trees. There are around 25 state champions and 6 national champions in the park that are known, and there could be even more that no one knows about yet. When we visited, we managed to find one using GPS that was about 500 feet off River Trail. It was a cherrybark oak ( Quercus pagoda ). The official circumference is 282 inches, but we measured 304. Finding these trees is extremely difficult, so if you're interested in seeing them, check out a Big Tree Walk with a park ranger. You'll be able to see some of these magnificent trees without the risk of getting lost in the swamp! If you're walking on your own, the park has around 25 miles of trails and these trails provide the best way to see the swampy landscape. The most popular trail is the boardwalks that start from behind the visitor center. The boardwalks are raised off the ground to keep your feet dry as well as protect sensitive vegetation. In the winter of 2013, an ice storm damaged the elevated boardwalk, which is currently closed and no time frame of getting it fixed. You can still make a loop with Sims Trail, however. The total mileage is about 2 miles. The rest of the trails are natural surface, though there are several footbridges throughout. Weston Lake Loop Trail makes a 4 mile loop and runs along its namesake oxbow lake and Cedar Creek. River Trail leads out to Congaree River. If the river level is low, there's a big sandbar and you can walk out to the middle of the river. The best time for hiking is in the winter - it's cool and less humid, the bugs are mostly dead, and snakes are hibernating. We visited when the mosquito meter was All Clear; I would not want to visit during War Zone!","December 26, 2014",Cypress Knees and Giant Trees,1031,"Raleigh, North Carolina",4

The trails are in the midst of being remarked and the ranger at the visitor's center is more than willing to explain the changes to any guest. Camping is free and first come, first serve. Paddling Cedar Creek is a real treat! Just be sure to check water levels to ensure something more than a portage fest. We experienced good water levels and had a great time navigating the creek's obstacles. We saw an abundance of wildlife on the water as well. Just be aware that the visitor's center is closed on Sundays and Mondays, and the elevated boardwalk is not entirely open.

The Boardwalk trail has been damaged and unfixed for nearly a year, obviously not high on their ""to-do"" list. Is the swamp beautiful? Yes it is.

An ice storm last winter damaged some of the boardwalk areas but they are being repaired and the late Fall, Winter and early Spring are a great time to visit if you don't care to bathe yourself in deet. Though a more colorful spectacle in the Summer, the mosquito population can be a real trial at that time of year. If you want to get a glimpse of trees 700 to a 1000 years old and experience a part of our country that didn't get logged off, come for a visit!

How sad a national park had to be created to stop companies from cutting down all the trees in the country.We hiked the Weston Lake Loop Trail through stands of cypress and tupelo trees. Along the river front there was a wild pig family with 2 adults and 3 piglets. We also saw a few but heard many songbirds and saw a great blue heron. We also saw a bug that either is naturally camouflaged as moss or somehow camouflages itself to look like moss.

Congaree National Park,"Whether you stroll the boardwalks, hike the dirt trails, or canoe Cedar Creek, you’ll quickly come to appreciate that Congaree National Park is much more than just a bunch of trees that are among the largest of their kind and a forest canopy that’s one of the tallest in the world. The park also harbors an amazing variety of plants and animals and protects the largest contiguous tract of old-growth bottomland hardwood forest remaining in the United States. It’s for good reason that it’s been called “Redwoods East” and characterized as “a living dinosaur.” Whatever you call it, there’s no place like it anywhere else in America. I’ve been visiting this place for 40 years now, dating back to when it was privately owned and we were struggling to save it from the loggers, and I’ve never gotten over my sense of awe and wonder. I love to show Congaree to others and watch their reactions, but I also love the isolation and quiet that I can easily find when I go there alone. I recently paid a solo visit to the park on a drizzly Sunday afternoon and found few other people there. Bicyclists were enjoying the smooth pavement of the long, twisting park road, several people were walking their dogs, and a few groups were on the trails, but that was about it. Even the visitor center was closed (as it is every Sunday, Monday, and federal holiday). It was wonderful.","October 15, 2014","Giant trees, old-growth forest, and amazing biodiversity",738,"Columbia, South Carolina",5

Congaree National Park,"My husband were excited to visit Congaree as part of a multi-day road trip. We researched and booked a well recommended ranger led canoe tour far ahead of time. The tour is only offered a limited number of times each year. Three days before we were supposed to do it, they called to cancel. We were a bit disappointed, but still wanted to give the park a fair chance. We arrived at the park and decided to walk the boardwalk, which was partially closed for repairs. We were able to make a loop by cutting across a service road/trail. The cypress knees look like some sort of fairy land, and the self guided tour sheet provided interesting information. Stop by if you are in the area to enjoy the National Park that the US government has set aside for preservation and enjoyment of the public, but it is not worth driving hundreds of miles to see. Also, the Visitor Center is closed on Sundays and Mondays.","October 8, 2014",Average,221,"Mariposa, California",3

It has a great one mile boardwalk for small children and older adults that don't want to actually hike. If you do want to hike the trails are very well marked and very easy. Bring your bug spray as there is water everywhere. Make sure you're wearing proper shoes, not sandals or flip-flops. It can be wet and a little muddy in places. The trees are hug and the landscape magical especially if there is a little fog hanging around. A must see if you're ever around Columbia SC.

Congaree National Park,"Everyone's heard of Yellowstone and Yosemite, but how many people know of Congaree National Park? Not many..... which is unfortunate because this little park is a real gem! Only designated a national park in 2003, the Congaree isn't as spectacular as the famous western national parks, but it includes some of the best biodiversity of any eastern U.S. park, with huge old-growth trees and unique bottomland hardwood forest. The park boasts several national and state champion trees (meaning they're HUGE!). Exceptionally large and tall loblolly pine, tupelo, and cypress. The park has a wonderful boardwalk that allows people to easily (and dryly) walk out among the giant trees. Even better is to canoe to some of the less accessible spots of the park, but the number and timings of the canoe trips are limited. You'll have a good chance of seeing tons of birds, snakes, turtles, and wild pigs. Good to bring your mosquito repellant, although the mosquitoes weren't bad at all the day we visited.The visitor center is small but includes typically high-quality National Park Service exhibits and movie.

Stick to the boardwalk area in wet weather as we went all the way to the congaree river, along the way we saw large pigs/ boars, which made it cool.

Congaree National Park,"We visited Congaree National Park during a road trip to Florida. As my screen name implies, I like visiting national parks, and I wanted to cross Congaree off my list. While it was not the most scenic, rugged, or adventure-filled national park, Congaree is worth seeing. Recent flooding prevented us from hiking any of the backcountry trails or even from walking the entire boardwalk loop, but the experience we did get to have was great. We walked part of the boardwalk, and we noticed that the old growth forest with its bald cypress trees, tall pines, and cypress knees gave the terrain a strange beauty of its own. Furthermore, Congaree is not a highly visited national park, so we did not experience the throngs of tourists that I have found in some of the most visited parks, like Great Smoky Mountains or Glacier. My wife and I enjoyed a solitary stroll on the boardwalk surrounded by nothing but nature.

Turns out the visitor's center is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. We were the only people there when we arrived. Decided to take the River Trail. I definitely regretted it. With the exception of some wild pigs/boars, there isn't much to see on this trail and we turned back when we reached the river rather than go all the way around the ""lollipop"" of the trail. My boots were so muddy that the mud was kicking up all over my legs. Had I worn sneakers they would have been ruined. I always want to get off the beaten trail and see what's out there, but in this case I wish I had just taken the Boardwalk and a maybe the loop around the lake. Got some good photos of the cypress trees (and their many knees) but I got most of them within a mile of the visitor's center. There's not a lot to see here that you can't see within a mile of the center.

Despite being closed, I was glad to see that they keep their passport stamps outside of the visitor center to be used by guests.We did walk the Boardwalk Trail. It is a very, very easy walk.We camped inside the park as well. The campsites are first come, first serve. We had zero problems obtaining a site- there was only one other family camping there. We later found out there had been a bad storm the night or two before we came and several sites were slightly flooded as a result. Our site was great for our two large families and easily held four tents. The campground has two vault toilets in the parking area. Be sure to take a flashlight when using the restroom during the night- it's a decent walk to the restroom and I nearly stepped on a snake. The campground was primitive, but nice. I had been worried about the mosquito, but they were minimal.We rented canoes from a local outfitter about thirty minutes away. We picked them up on the way into the park. A ranger checking in on the campground gave us some suggestions on where to canoe. From the campsite we turned right and exited the park, drove a few short miles to a road that offered parking and then had to carry the canoes down to the river less than a quarter mile. There were some down trees that we had to navigate around, but the canoeing was an absolute blast! I highly recommend it.

There was still plenty of interest in the cypress trees, vines, ""knees"", palms, etc. I appreciated the walking guide with descriptions at numbered points along the boardwalk.

It would be interesting to see when the water is higher. Unfortunately, though we had signed up for a guided kayak tour back in February, it was cancelled a few days ahead because the water was too low and blocked with trees and debris.

There is an elevated walking trail for those more squeamish types who worry about critters and such but also miles of on the ground hiking trails. We took them, followed the rangers advice and walked several miles of worries yet fulfilling hiking/sightseeing of the flora and fauna of this peaceful unique park.

Unfortunately the raised boardwalk was closed when I visited in May ’14 but the lower walk was open.You can book tours through the visitor center but none were available during our visit. So I booked a tour with a local outfitter (Adventure Carolina) that lasted 2 hours. We used kayaks instead of canoes as it provided us the ability to move about the Cedar Creek better. I have never kayaked before so was a little nervous, our guide did an excellent job teaching me and helping when I needed. The creek was at a moderate water level but still we ran into several downed trees that we had to muscle our way through. The view from the creek was amazing! The cypress trees along the banks hung over us and you felt you were in the middle of a swamp. The only downside was I could not carry my camera as it was not waterproof but my guide carried it for me and took some photos. Even if you don’t get on the river, the Cedar Creek boat launch area is worth exploring.The Owl Prowl was not available during the weeknights but the ranger suggested we walk the boardwalk at dusk to listen for the owls. We did hear owls but the part most extraordinary was the lightning bugs!!! I am not gifted with words to describe the walk along the board walk and looking out to see a field of flashing lights. It was one of those moments in life you just have to stop and catch your breath. If you are leery of walking in the dark, know that you do not need to walk far on the boardwalk to see this amazing display. A small flashlight can get you to a point to watch, then shut of the light and enjoy.Hiked some of the trails but ice damage from last year’s storm made some very difficult to follow.I enjoyed my trip and am glad I made a special trip to this national park.","June 1, 2014",Get on the water,1,"Kent, Washington",4

I’ve been to 20+ National parks, and this one is special like all the rest, but the things to do at Congaree are more limited than all the Parks out west.

The highlights of this park were the different wildlife that may be seen (we saw various birds including a Pileated Woodpecker, a few snakes, turtles, and skinks) and a wide variety of old growth trees including large cypress (with their knees), pine, tupelo and others.There is a nice picnic pavilion to eat at near the visitor’s center, but make sure you bring your food in as there were no food options in the park. The swampy areas were buggy too, so bring some bug spray.First national park that I can think of that did not have a movie in the visitor center.I’m giving it 5 stars because there are some great things to do in the park and I see why it’s a national park, but just note that there are more limited things to do at this park compared to some others with the same designation.

Congaree National Park,"We had originally planned our visit for a Sunday, but after finding that the visitor center is closed on Sundays and Mondays, we changed our plans around to visit on a Thursday. Luckily we did for there was a massive search-and-rescue operation that closed down the park the day we would have gone.We showed up at 8:30 am before the visitor center opened at 9:00 am. We had planned for the 6.6 mile Oakridge Trail. We had done some research before hand contacting the rangers via email and knew that the trail was passable, but that a GPS/Compass were advised and that the trail was not easily followed in areas. This was very true. You need to be well prepared for this hike or you will potentially end up in a search and rescue type operation.There are trail maps at the visitor center before getting on the board walk - take one! Once you step off the boardwalk, you might need it. We had no trouble with getting to the Oakridge trail, but once there, finding the red trail markers was not always easy. A good tool if you have two people - have one stand at the known marker until the other person finds the next marker. We had to do this in a few places. There are trees down...there are wet areas...there are bugs...it is a swamp. It is a bit of a mentally challenging hike. Don't step off the boardwalk unless you are prepared and have gotten some trail information. We were fine with the hike, but could see where someone could get in to trouble. Be smart.","May 3, 2014",Good Visit,249,"Warrenville, IL",4

The experience of walking the elevated boardwalk while the river was slowly flowing below more than made up for the limited availability of trails. It really felt like I had entered a swamp. On my second visit, the river had receded, which let me explore the lower boardwalk and other trails in the park. On both visits, I saw plenty of wildlife.I stayed in the Longleaf campground, which is near the park entrance. There's a central parking lot so there is a short walk to each site. There are vault toilets at the campground and nicer facilities at the visitor's center. No water at the campground. There are fire pits and picnic tables at each site. I had the campground to myself both nights. There are no fees for camping.I would definitely recommend the park for a day or overnight camping trip for anyone driving through the Columbia area.","February 13, 2014",Nice place to hike and camp,26,"Akron, Ohio",5
Congaree National Park,"A very gorgeous and peaceful look at the swamplands around the Congaree River. Pristine conditions and if you are lucky you'll get to see local wildlife. We saw deer, wild hogs, rabbits, squirrels and birds. Turtles and fish at the lake. Be sure to bring bug spray as it is a swamp and the mosquitos are plentiful. I would suggest you bring along water as well since although the tree canopy provides excellent shade the humidity makes it feel hotter than it is.","February 8, 2014",Gorgeous scenery,63,"Lexington, South Carolina",4
Congaree National Park,"Every January, my family and I go on a cruise that leaves from either Tampa or Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Due to soaring airline prices, we prefer to drive down, and this was a great stop along the way. We came because we are always exploring new national parks, and we were not disappointed! Although the weather was not warm, it was not humid either, and there were no mosquitos to ruin our day. Once we arrived, we decided to take the Boardwalk Trail, which was not too long for our 7 year old son. The mangroves were amazing, the water was beautiful, and we even saw wildlife! Much to our excitement, we saw feral hogs, which are basically wild pigs. In addition, we saw turtles, birds, squirrels, and a pileated woodpecker. We have been to hundreds of national parks around the country, and I would definitely rate this one in the top 3.

Congaree National Park,"I went to see this since I'd read about it. It is unique in that you walk on a raised platform, above the swamp/bog -- for miles. I couldn't even go to the very end since, when the platform wen down to the forest floor, it was still flooded - not passable.Unique flora & fauna. I didn't see many animals since it was so wet. The birds were all around & you are so far off the beaten path you can hear (& enjoy) them easily. This was a nature walk in the true sense of the word.Staff @ the Information Center were very helpful. They made suggestions about what to watch for, where to go (there are multiple trails), what was passable @ this time of the year, etc. Make sure to check in with them since they are a great source of information.","January 1, 2014",A nice walk in the park -- very tranquil and enjoyable,61,"Wilmington, North Carolina",4

Congaree National Park,"We broke the drive to Charleston up with a detour here on Thanksgiving afternoon, and despite about 15 cars in the parking lot we basically had the forest to ourselves the whole time we were there.As other reviews state, you have a variety of trails here but the one that surely gets the most action is the boardwalk loop that takes you through bald cypress, swamp, and pine territory. The boardwalk makes it a very easy hike (""hike"" may even be too strong a word) and as such it's great for novices, kids, the elderly, etc. We ran across a couple pushing a stroller and with a dog in tow, for example. At 2.4 miles, our family of 4 made it with photo breaks and such in about 90 minutes.If you've never seen bald cypresses before, they have these stubs that stick out of the ground that provide support to the trees somehow (and they need it, as you see evidence of trees downed by hurricanes and tornadoes throughout). And there are a lot of them - it looks like something out of a sinister fairy tale when the boardwalk takes you through a massive space full of them.As it was late November and in the mid-40s, didn't see much in the way of wildlife outside of squirrels. We heard some woodpeckers going to town, though. But no mosquitoes, at least.A nice place to see, and an even better place to hear. As isolated as you'll be, just stop and rest for a minute, and listen to the sounds of the forest.

While we did not have the place to ourselves, our walk along the boardwalk to Weston Lake and back was tranquil, even serene. The people we met along the way, including a park ranger and a park volunteer, were pleasant. We also met interesting wildlife -- like a snake swimming with its mouth open taking in delicious tidbits from the water -- and heard birds we never saw. While this park does not have the breath-taking grandeur of the western parks, it has a mystery and a beauty all its own. Since the park is open through the night, we are looking forward to a return visit to listen for owls.

It was still wet from the rain though.We took the boardwalk trail, so were above the swampy area. It was a nice walk. We were the only ones we saw on the trail other than the rangers. There is a self-guided tour brochure which has descriptions to match up with numbered markers on the trail. Unfortunately, many of the markers were missing, so the rangers were attempting to put some temporary markers back up. It was swampy, but a beautiful walk with some beautiful big old trees, as well as some large spiders along the trail. Unfortunately, the spiders didn't make too much of a dent in the mosquito population. We all wore insect repellant, but you could tell the spots we missed with the repellant after our walk. For me it was my face!Apparently, they recently opened the boardwalk trail to pets, and since we had our dog with us, we were glad they did.I'm not sure I would make a special trip just for this park, but since it was only slightly off our route on our trip to visit my brother, it was well worth the visit.","September 3, 2013",National Park all to ourselves,7,"Rochester, New York",4

Our boys were very excited to see an alligator sunning in the lake. The huge pines and cypress were impressive....Mosquitos were not!!! Use bug spray with deet! Nothing else will work.

Congaree National Park,"For people who love getting out in nature this is a very nice trip. They say this isn't a swamp but a flood plain. Either way the boardwalk they've built for people to access the ""swamp"" is great. The 2 1/2 mile loop boardwalk allows you to enjoy the massive trees and swamp wildlife without needing waders. They have the largest trees outside of the California redwoods. You can get a sore neck trying to look up to see the tops of some of these tall pine, cypress, etc. My favorite were the Bald Cypress with their fields of cypress knees all around. As with most National Parks we've visited, the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. One warning for anyone visiting in the warm/hot months is to be ready with insect repellant. The mosquitoes are ruthless but we actually tested the bounce fabric softener theory and it worked. Very few bites among millions of skeeters. They also have a ton of spiders in webs around. Some of the biggest spiders I've ever seen, but they are too busy trapping mosquitoes to bother you. They have other trails besides the boardwalk for hiking also. Congaree also has ranger led canoe trips which I hope to try next time. We will definitely visit again. You may want to check with the park before going to make sure of availability of some hikes as flooding during periods of heavy rain can close some parts of the park.","August 22, 2013",A great place to enjoy the beauty and quite of nature.,35,"Charlotte, North Carolina",4
Congaree National Park,"My boyfriend, parents, and I stopped here on our vacation. Whenever we got there, the rangers told us that we probably couldn't go to any of the trails because of them were washed out because of the rain. They also told us that the mosquitoes would eat us alive even if we put on bugspray. They gave us a map and highlighted the trails that we could probably attempt (the boardwalk trails) and told us to bring plenty of bugspray. Their mosquito meter was on ""War Zone"" and it wasn't lying. It was awful. If you stopped walking, you were swarmed and bitten a zillion times. When you weren't walking, they swarmed behind you. We walked to the lake and back on the boardwalk trail. We saw where other trails were completely washed out which was scary to think that snakes and other critters could possibly be on the trail. We did see a big snake on a log at the lake. We also saw a lizard in the water on our way back. The whole park is swamp which was nothing special since we are from Florida so we didn't see any ""oooh"" or ""aaah"" from it. I rate the park poor because the trails were washed out, it was just swampland, the mosquitoes were awful, and it was dangerous that snakes could be on the trails. There were mosquitoes in the bathrooms but other than that the bathrooms were clean. The visitor center was nice and had a museum and a small gift shop.","August 19, 2013",Don't Go During the Rainy Season!,159,"DeLand, Florida",2

On my visit 7/27/13, 90% of the park was under water due to heavy rain. Even at that, it was well worth the hour we spent walking the boardwalk and taking pictures of the old growth cypress trees.

Even though the day of our visit was sunny we were under their canopy the entire time...no sunburn. We were warned about mosquitoes so we liberally applied repellant before arriving.

Cedar Creek meanders through the park and we have kayaked on the creek several times. Check with the ranger station first to see what the water level is and how trees are down across the creek. Camping is allowed in the park - with restrictions and there is a camping area outside the main gate. The park rangers are knowledgeable, helpful and enthusiastic about the park. The welcome center is set up as an educational center about trees which fascinating, given the park in home to many 'Grand Champions"" (ie the tallest or largest of their kind).

There were so many tall and beautiful trees, although the gigantic ones are mostly in areas well off the beaten path. The boardwalk took us over many different habitats and we saw many birds such as woodpeckers and a barred owl. There is a free canoe trip offered, but three months worth of trips fill up in about a half hour, and we unfortunately were unable to get a spot. Although it is not the parks fault, there were so many people that spent most of their time talking so loud that all the birds flew away.

We learned quite a bit about this swamp as we followed the trail map that was provided. This is a free attraction and certainly worth seeing.

Congaree National Park,"My husband and I have been here twice now and we've loved it every time. It's peaceful and pretty and the trails are nice to hike. It's a great place to see migrating birds too. There is also a nice boardwalk over the swamp if you don't feel like walking on the regular trails. The park also has a beautiful visitor center.

Congaree National Park,"Our family of 2 grandparents in mid 70s, 3 adult children and one teenager all toured the park on a warm June day. The visitor's center is well lighted and contains displays of early civilization inhabitants, as well as stuffed animals representing those found in the park. A small gift shop is also available there, as well as brochures and a map for a self guided walk. The boardwalk circle is just short of 2 easy miles, with stops at notable flora and fauna. There is an outlook deck overlooking the Congaree River, upon which a large snake was swimming toward our shore. He quickly disappeared in the underbrush. There were many turtles on the shore, and total quiet until one fussy child joined us. There are many hiking trails throughout the park for those more adventurous, we stayed on the walkway. It was a delightful experience.","September 1, 2012",A naturalists dream,7,"Oak Park Heights, Minnesota",5

Congaree National Park,"This virgin, old-growth forest was spared logging because of the challenge of access, from colonial times forward. There are stories of slaves and vagabonds having encampments here, where they could evade detection and capture. Nowadays, there are some very nice boardwalks through the swamp, ranger guided walks and moonlight owl prowls, camping, and miles of hiking and canoeing. Mosquitos can be very annoying in the hot summers. October through April is the best time of year to go for a simple stroll on the boardwalk or for a weekend of camping. One of the unforgettable things to do for nature lovers visiting Columbia. ","August 17, 2012",A rare virgin forest,9,"Columbia, South Carolina",5
Congaree National Park,"We decided to visit Congaree National Park while visiting Columbia, SC. The visitor center was really well done, with two very helpful rangers. Our daughters were in shorts and flip-flops, but we wanted to walk the boardwalk trail, so headed out. Since it was at the end of the day, we only walked to the third trail site, but the trees were amazing. More amazing was the size of the bugs we encountered -- much to the shrills of our daughters. I titled this review ""dress appropriately"" because we should have had better shoes and long pants and sleeves. Since it was damp, the boardwalk was slippery and had slippery fallen leaves on it. One of our daughters almost slipped and fell in her flip flops. Plus, although the mosquito meter only read ""moderate"", we did get buzzed by mosquitos. We'll plan better next time I'm sure !","August 13, 2012",Dress Appropriately,192,"Lancaster, Pennsylvania",4
Congaree National Park,"This is a really neat park. There is a visitors center where they have several displays and a small shop. A college intern was there setting up his photo display of pictures he took over the summer. It was neat to see all the wildlife and scenery. I am happy to say we did not see any of the snakes or alligators he took pictures of though!We walked the boardwalk which took us over an hour. We had kids ranging from 9 - 14 yrs of age who all enjoyed it. The scenery reminded us of Lord of the Rings for some reason! Lots of cypress, cypress knobs, droopy trees. We did see a group of wild hogs which was absolutely fascinating to the kids! I couldn't get a good picture though. Overall, the scenery was beautiful.There are also free canoe trips, but you have to reserve about 2 months in advance.

Congaree National Park,"I managed to work a day in our family vacation schedule so that I could hike the Congaree on my own. The trail guide brochure says: Silence, Quiet, Serenity, Peace, Guidance, Calm, and Beauty. It was all that, and more. Walking by myself, I didn't run into another hiker after I left the boardwalk. I enjoyed the solitude.I hiked the Oakridge Trail which is approximately 6.6 miles long. Even though the mosquito activity was high, I kept moving and didn't get a single bite. I dressed appropriately and used repellent. Along this trail I saw a flock of Ibises, a great horned owl, a raccoon, turtles, skinks, dragonflies and butterflies, lots of millipedes, cardinals, and some other red noisy birds. The stars of the place though are the trees! These Old growth forests boast some monsters. The Cyprus, Tupelo and Loblolly Pines are gigantic. The knees from the Cypruses are most fascinating. The 6.6 mile Oakridge trail is quite long, I had the time to kill and I moved fast - but it still took almost 3 hours. The 4.4 mile Weston Lake loop would be a good option if you wanted to get off the boardwalk. Weston Lake is worth seeing. I was surprised by the elevated boardwalk by the lake. I had lunch there. For whatever reason, there were no mosquitos there.The park personnel were friendly. My only complaint is the visitors center. It is weak at best, this needs some serious upgrading. I am not sure the general public would completely appreciate this park, but as a science teacher - I found this national park spectacular.","July 10, 2012",For what it is ...it is awesome.,250,"Saint Louis, Missouri",4

We sighted a great blue heron winging its way over the lake and a gigantic woodpecker pecking a tree in the swamp nearby. Snacks are available for purchase in the Nature Center. The trail mix was the perfect snack for the trail. We had had a lovely time in Charleston prior to the walk, so I was surprised when my son said that Congaree was his favorite part of the trip.

Rangers are especially friendly and helpful, most likely since this is only a lightly visited national park. The ""national park"" rating is why I rated this place as ""average"". When I think of a national park I think of Mt. Rainier, Zion, or Yellowstone, not a cypress forest. It just doesn't compare. Having said that, I still recommend it as worth seeing to experience a unique and interesting forest, just don't expect stunning natural wonders that American national park's are famous for.

Congaree National Park,"Congaree National Park is a fantastic place to walk, explore and learn. They have a wonderful interpretive center that will tell you all about ecology of the forest. It also sells drinks and snacks and gifts. On weekends there are volunteers who lead amazing tours. On your first visit, if tours are not available or you are not a group tour person, grab the free walking tour guide. Along the boardwalk trail there are numbers that correspond to the guide and you'll learn about the value of a tidal flood plain, old growth trees, as well as the diverse plants and animals in the forest. Don't be fooled by the boardwalk, which is just an overview and less than a two mile walk. The park is enormous and stepping off the boardwalk puts you into a vast array of longer and shorter trails crossing into the less explored areas.We live near the park and love it year round. In the winter you can see so much further without leaves on all the trees, in the hot SC summer it's cool and shaded, in the fall there is real color and beauty. In the spring, we've encountered flooding in wet years, it is a flood plain after all, but the boardwalk rises above it. And some of the trails are higher. Spring is also a great time to canoe or kayak as navigation is so much easier when the rivers are swollen. In the last year or so on our visits we've seen the rare piliated wood pecker, a family of wild pigs, deer, bats, muskrats and more.

This definitely meets all criteria for a National Park. A truly amazing forest -- the tallest deciduous forest on the planet. Yes, our fir-pine forests in the Pacific NW are much taller, but they are nowhere near as diverse. The range of tree species and the number of record trees is incredible. The boardwalk was spectacular, and exploring onto the more remote trails even more rewarding. What a treasure. We're proud as Americans that individuals with vision and foresight managed to preserve this magical space. We've had a couple wonderful canoe trips through the Okeefenokee -- Congaree is a great counterpoint -- lots of similarities but even more differences.

They two boardwalks that take you around and back to the visitors center. These are handicapped accessible and also have benches and ""pull-offs"" along the way for those who just want to rest a spell and enjoy the beauty and peacefulness that is Congaree NP. You will definitely hear lots of birds! The trees are tall (some National Champion trees can be found here) and the canopy full which makes a great habitat for songbirds. Weston Lake (an Oxbow lake) is home to river otters, huge turtles, Lots of fish! and the ocassional alligator. There are several hiking trails ranging in length from the 4.6 miles Weston Lake Loop to the 11.1 mile King Snake Trail. I have hiked the Weston Lake Loop and the the 7.5 mile Oakridge Trail. All the trails are easy and flat. It's true that you won't see any breathtaking vistas but when you are walking along the banks of Ceday Creek and an otter suddenly appears - it's magical! The quiet beauty and tranquility of the backcountry is worth the hike. The visitors center has a nice short documentary on the park ( I usually catch it after every visit - a chance to rest and sit in a cool place!) They have a nice selection of souvenirs and books, too. And be sure to check out the Skeeter Meter! It may seem like a quite a conversation piece but be assured that you need to take the reading seriously or you may be miserable. In other words ""don't forget the bug spray!"" in warm weather. Covered picnic shelters with grills are provided and they have primitive camping as well as backcountry camping. I camped in the primitive camping area one weekend several years ago.

Once there, there was a small visitor center I didn't spend much time in, and I proceeded on a medium size hike. There is a long boardwalk, and then you descend to the forest floor, free to head down whatever path you choose. The diversity of flora was fascinating, and also some animals, including huge turtles, and spiders!

Swamp is mostly dry during the summer and fall months, but wet in the winter and spring months. We usually go during the winter months.

If you do venture out between April - September you will see lots (lots) of snakes and some are indeed poisonous. Reports of feral hogs also exist. During the cooler months a walk along the miles of boardwalks (kept up nicely) and muddy trails gets you into the heart of a dismal, but interesting swampland. But, with the leaves gone it's a little monochromatic.There are lots of trails to suit almost anyone and some stay completely above ground on the boardwalks.

Upon our return, we suddenly realized that we hadn't visited the one that was about 15 miles down the road. So, spontaneously one early afternoon, we hopped into the car and drove to this state treasure. It is a hiker/nature lover's dream. We did the 2.5 mile, two-plus hour boardwalk tour. It was fairly dry because, as the ranger told us, there was a substantial rainfall deficit. Nevertheless, we saw why this former National Monument was made a National Park, to ensure that this unusual site, the largest intact tract of old-growth floodplain forest in North America, not only was preserved but expanded to include and protect newer adjacent land acquisitions.

Congaree National Park,"We visited the park for the first time in December to get an overview without dealing with the mosquitoes. Since it is a floodplain, the insects can be brutal in the warmer months (in fact, they have an indicator at the visitors station, rating the little critters from ""No Activity"" to War Zone""). Additionally, you will want to check on flood levels if you are considering a visit at other times of the year. The entire area is completely flooded on occasion.We hiked the Oakridge trail and saw some magnificent trees and wildlife. The trail is not too difficult, just pick up your feet to avoid tripping over roots. There is virtually no climbing. Of course, you can take advantage of the 2-mile boardwalk and get a great overview without every stepping on soil.The other trails begin along the boardwalk. However animals are not allowed on the boardwalk, so if you are bringing a dog you will need to plan accordingly. You can reach the other trails by using the Pet Access stairs at the beginning of the boardwalk behind the visitor's center. Follow the trail until you see the Bluff Trail sign at the T. Go LEFT. That trail will intersect with the Sims trail in about a half mile. At that point, turn right and follow the Sims trail south (very wide and flat) to the junction of the boardwalk, Oakridge and Weston Lake Loop trails. from there, follow the trail map to the trail(s) of your choice. We took a a right at the Bluff Trail sign and made about a 1-1 1/2 mile loop that we did not need to take. We would have preferred to have spent more time along the Oakridge and Weston Lake Loop trail. Now we know... and so do you!On our late fall Saturday hike, we saw very few people.

Congaree National Park,"Congaree is the nation's second newest national park, and to be honest I had not even heard of it until a couple of years ago. I can say without hesitation that it is one of the most spectacular places I have ever visited. It is almost a secret though. I visited mid-week and there were very few people there. I was told it is much busier in fall and spring when the water levels are higher and it is more conducive to canoeing. Park admission is free. There are 2 campgrounds; 1 is primitive with no facilities. The visitor center is small as national park visitor centers go but there is a good introductory film that I recommend before exploring. The park employees were all very friendly and informative; they enhance the experience. If you only have a few hours to spend at the park the Boardwalk Loop Trail is the way to go. It is 2.4 miles long and it must have been quite a project to build such an extensive structure. The next morning I was going to hike the 10 mile River Trail but a ranger recommended the 6.6 mile Oak Ridge Trail instead because of the spectacular oak trees along the way. She also said this time of year the River Trail gets overgrown with vegetation. I took her advice and am glad I did. Most of the trails start out on the Boardwalk Trail and branch off from it. The trails are well-blazed and there are well constructed footbridges over all water crossings. On the Oak Ridge Trail I did not encounter one other person, but I did see deer and I believe wild hogs, which I kept my distance from. As I was the first trailblazer of the day I did encounter countless spider webs spun across the trail so if you suffer from arachnophobia what are you doing in the deep woods to begin with lol. I cannot come up with appropriate words to describe the majesty of these soaring hardwoods (and loblolly pines for good measure). There are several champion trees here and I saw sycamores, oaks, beech and other trees that I never imagined could grow that tall.

Congaree National Park,"It is a very lucky thing that people were so dedicated to keep this area of South Carolina from being torn down by loggers. The forest here is absolutely amazing and filled with tons of different species, vegetation, and other life. Admission was free (or we somehow accidentally missed where we were supposed to pay) and the visitors center is very informational and the park rangers are friendly and helpful. The park is a set of trails throughout the forest that have markers along the way to show you different types of growth, trees, and other things that stick out of the ordinary that you have not seen anywhere else. It’s a flood plain so it occasionally floods throughout the year and it’s a swamp most the rest of the time, but it was quite dry when we went. There were so many things to see, from the large looming trees that make up the canopy, the fallen trees various plants, and other things that make up the floor, the insects and animals that live all around, and so many unique things. We saw turtles and even got to hear a tree fall down somewhere! I would highly recommend stopping by this National Park and taking the 2-mile boardwalk trip to see all things it has to offer, with something to offer at every turn. Very very cool!!","August 10, 2011",Unique taste of a diverse ecosystem,94,"Tampa, Florida",5
Congaree National Park,Went on a morning walk along the boardwalk. Beautiful old trees tower above. Kids enjoyed the walk as well. The staff was very helpful=they explained a lot of the trails to me before we set out on our walk.

Congaree National Park,Very Nice Park. There are no fees to visit this very well maintained park. The Rangers and staff were very helpful and friendly. We did a morning walk on the Boardwalk trail. Make sure you grab a copy of the self guided tour information for the Boardwalk Trail. It has numbered sights along the boardwalk that explains some of the great natural beauty you'll see on your walk.,"June 30, 2011",Congaree National Park,111,"Batavia, Illinois",4
Congaree National Park,"My wife and I stopped here on our way north from Florida and enjoyed our short visit. We arrived about a half hour before the park was set to close, but we were told by one of the very friendly rangers there is an after hours parking lot just outside the gate. So we parked there and rode our bycycles back into the park to the visitors center (about a half mile). Since it was late in the day, we decided to just do the boardwalk which winds for about 2 1/2 miles through the old growth forest. There are some amazing trees to see. The day we were there it had just rained and then the sun came out as we started our walk. So the sun filtering through the trees and the mist from evaporating rain made it look very errie. Tip: bring insect repellent, the forest is very wet. The boardwalk is pretty slippery when wet also. If you make advance reservations you can rent canoes to see more of the park.","August 3, 2009",Great View of Old Growth Forest,61,TARPON SPRINGS,4

Congaree National Park,"The Congaree National Park is the largest stretch of old growth lowland forest in the United States. The park features several well maintained trails including several walks through towering Long Leaf Pines, Cyprus, and other varieties. The park hosts the national record size for several varieties of trees.One of my favorite trails is a two mile boardwalk that wanders its way from the visitors center through the forest back to an oxbow lake. Half of this boardwalk is just above high water level which gives you a nice forest floor perspective. The other half of the boardwalk is an elevated section which provides a view of the forest from 10 or so feet in the air. This boardwalk loop provides great photo opportunities as well as a great way to glempse this special forest.The Visitors Center is small but has some nice exhibits.For those who want to explore things a little bit more closely ask at the Visitor's Center about the canoe tours or the longer trails.This National Park is not well known, but it is certainly worth a visit to see what the lowland forests of the Southern United States used to look like.","December 29, 2007",Walk with Giants,447,"Lugoff, South Carolina",5
Congaree National Park,"My friend and I canoed on Cedar Creek from Cedar Creek Landing all the way to the Congaree River, finishing at Bates Bridge Boat Landing at Hwy 601. It's a 20-mile trail that requires countless portages due to numerous fallen Cypress and Tupelo trees on the creek. The water level in the first half of September was 2-3 ft. Sometimes there were so many obstacles that we doubted whether we were on the right trail. Once, we doubted so much that we traveled back to a fork in the creek. Then we discovered we had been on the right trail the first time! So, we had to travel that way again. In the end, we carried our boat over several of the same obstacles twice. We tried to wash the mud from our hands with black creek water so we could replenish our energy with a snack. We had to attempt to clean our hands this way every time we wanted to eat, as our hands were constantly getting dirty as we navigated around fallen trees. At some points on the trail, we could remain in the boat by lying on our backs on the bottom of the canoe so we could squeeze under a fallen trees. A few times we had to get out of water and portage on the creek bank, which was a nightmare. It was extremely hard to portage on the land as it was very muddy. We often found ourselves up to our knees in mud. Often we had to portage over trees, a couple of times slipping into the black water of the creek. Snakes weren't an issue as we hardly saw them. We did see some otters along the trail. We met many fluffy spiders that had spun webs on fallen trees; while we were going under those trees they were hanging right above our faces.The creek portion of trail took us 7 hours to complete. We had rented a Ford F250 to pick up the canoe from a rental place in downtown Columbia. Then, we locked the canoe to a tree at Cedar Creek Landing. Next, we drove our 4Runner and the truck to Bates Bridge Landing. We left the truck there and drove back to the Cedar Creek Landing to start our adventure at around noon.By the time we got to Congaree River, it was 7 pm. We had another 13-14 mi to go. We canoed a big portion of it in the dark at the mercy of the light of moon. It was nearly full, generously shining on the river enough to make the path ahead visible. We also had a powerful light that we were using only on the turns to make sure we don't hit branches of trees possibly fallen in the river or land on the bank of the river. I cannot say it was a very pleasant experience. We were constantly hearing strange noises, not being able to identify the source. I fell asleep a couple of times for a second or two while canoeing. We eventually finished, arriving at Bates Bridge Boat Landing just past 10 pm.It was a life experience unlike any other. I have no regrets. However, I certainly do NOT wish to try it a second time. It was a sweet nightmare. How can I not say it was sweet, while we were blessed by the scenery of those beautiful marvelous Cypress and Tupelo trees, sounds of Otters and birds, those scary spiders, and watching strong lightning happening on the distance while we were at the mercy of the moonlight paddling on the astonishing Congaree River at night with no one around.
