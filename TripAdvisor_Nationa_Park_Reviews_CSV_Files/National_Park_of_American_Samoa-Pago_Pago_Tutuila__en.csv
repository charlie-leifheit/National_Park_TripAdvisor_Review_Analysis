National Park of American Samoa,"Once you've seen a few islands, you kinda know what to expect. Dense jungle, coconut and banana palms, the occasional photo worthy view at the summit, or through the trees. Anyway, good for a short hike as not that much to do on American Samoa.","October 13, 2019",Worth a visit but not that special,60,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",3
National Park of American Samoa,"Unique park with many interesting views and beautiful scenery. Start at the visitor center, which is not particularly easy to find. If you have time, fly down to Ofu Island to see the very rugged part of the park and stay in a unique motel, far from the usual traveler.","August 29, 2019",Great Adventure,5,"Gig Harbor, Washington",5
National Park of American Samoa,"Go to the National Park information office as the staff are very helpful and there is a lot of history to learn about. (Note: it does not open on weekends) to get a basic map. The park is very lush and in places overgrown and the tracks are not always easily marked. Some of the access for the walks is near/on local villages and private land and it is polite to offer some money or ask the person if there is an access fee (it is there village you are going through). We found it helpful to have a high clearance vehicle as some access roads have pot holes. Overall nice national park, great views but overgrown in places.","August 16, 2019",Great National Park visit,79,New Zealand,4
National Park of American Samoa,"This review is for NPS visitors and those seeking junior ranger badges. American Samoa is a beautiful natural environment. The park's visitors center is excellent and the staff is first-rate. However, the park itself is not well maintained, as in, the trails are poor, dirty, and difficult to access. The only decent place to stay on the island is Sadie's, and it's not ideal. (If you have visited the Rodeway Inn at Carlsbad Caverns, you know what that is like.) This was our only visit to a national park where we felt unsafe. We had items stolen from our car and our hotel. At one point, we turned back on a trail to the marine refuge because of some gentle hostility from the locals. I understand that it's often the custom to give some money to people who live near the trail or beach you intend to visit, but I don't like having conversations with people holding machetes when I am with my kids. If you are planning to visit for the junior ranger badge, skip it. Mail in the book. Not worth the hassle of a visit. I'm sorry to be saying that about a national park.","July 29, 2019",You can mail the Junior Ranger book in - and should!,1,"New York City, New York",2
National Park of American Samoa,"We are on a quest to visit all 61 US National Parks. Our sole reason for flying to American Samoa was to see this Park, which is number 49 on our list of Parks to visit. The visitor center is very well done and the staff friendly and helpful. We are retired and not very mobile any more, so did not take any hikes, but we drove everywhere we possibly could go to see as much of the island and the Park as we could. It is a beautiful location.","July 15, 2019",Number 49 of 61 US National Parks,26,"Phoenix, Arizona",4

National Park of American Samoa,"We rarely rate any National Park less than a 5, but there is cause in this case. This National Park is beautiful and lush with lots of green flowering tropical plants and flowers. The Visitor Center (in Pago Pago, not in the park) is easily accessed and the rangers have great information of the best ways to visit the park. Access to the park proper can be a bit of a challenge. There is one road that takes you to the western boundary of the park and a trailhead (strenuous) that takes you to the top of the mountain. Access to other trailheads are not easily distinguishable due to signage issues. The main road into the park proper (and to the bulk of the trails) is around the harbor, past the tuna plant and then through a small village up to the mountain pass. There is a small overlook to the windward bay and Pola Island - offering beautiful views. There is a beach trail at the end of the road (in a village) that will take you to the end of the point for a different view of Pola Island.One needs to be cautious of roaming dogs (not all friendly) and wandering passersby seeking a handout. The ""gem"" of the park is on Ofu Island - and cannot be reached in a single day trip with a return - due to commercial air travel limitations. One has to fly from Tutuila to Ta'u, and then take a ferry to Ofu & Olesega. This requires at least an overnight stay and a fair amount of planning ahead of time - don't expect to pull this off after arriving on Tutuila.The views of the night sky are spectacular and one can experience many constellations not otherwise seen in the northern hemisphere. Go to the top of the pass at night, take bug spray and enjoy the stars.It's a beautiful park, but it does have limitations.","March 28, 2019",Beautiful park.,543,"Denham Springs, Louisiana",4

National Park of American Samoa,"This beautiful, pristine, untouched, paleotropical rain-forest National Park is unlike any other US NPS site that you may visit. It is the only NPS site south of the equator, and as the NPS brochure states, ""You will not find the usual facilities of most national parks. Instead, with a bit of the explorer's spirit, you will discover secluded villages, rare plants and animals, coral sand beaches and vistas of land and sea"". That is a very appropriate statement; you definitely need an explorer's spirit (or perhaps a local guide).The visitor center is absolutely fantastic (see my other review), but it is located in Pago Pago, and not technically inside the National Park boundary. There are two road signs in Pago, pointing you in the right direction to follow paved roads towards the park boundary. However, there aren't really any signs indicating you've actually entered National Park land. Furthermore, there are no trail-head signs marking the start of the various hikes. If you look closely while on the hiking trails, you may notice a few dilapidated, weather-worn interpretive signs that you may be able to discern some details from.So get to it, and go exploring!","December 9, 2018",A Unique National Park unlike any other in the US NPS,511,"Waterton Lakes National Park, Canada",4
National Park of American Samoa,"Stopped in America Samoa as part of a cruise. After our excursion we decided to walk to the National Park visitors center. The sign said 3/4 of a mile, sure seemed a lot further going there, but coming back it seemed shorter.

National Park of American Samoa,"I went to American Samoa specifically to hike the park and it didn’t disappoint. It is large, lush and varied. The only downside at present is the Mt. Alava trail is partially closed due to storm damage so I couldn’t hike all the way across. The parts I was able to hike, however, were well defined, mostly shaded, challenging pathways through beautiful, green rainforest and at times afforded excellent views of the mountains and ocean. After hiking up the mountain, I did the beach walk through Vatia and beyond to see Polu island of the coast. The staff was quite helpful also, one ranger even gave me a ride back to Pago Pago after my day of hiking. If you’re in the region and up for an adventure, be sure to visit the park.","October 12, 2018",Beautiful Park,5,"Los Angeles, California",5
National Park of American Samoa,"A local suggested that I drive to the beautifully located and quaint village of Vatia at the end of a road that goes over the main mountain pass with great views of Pago-Pago harbour, through the forest with equally great views over the coastline on the other side and eventually to Vatia. It was a very enjoyable ride. And I wish i had more time to also hike through the forest. But if you're short on time, this drive is highly recommended.

In order to appreciate the whole effect, you should really take the tours of Ofu and Ta'u. Ofu is especially beautiful.

The beach here is one of those where every boulder wobbles when you step on it and threatens to turn your ankle. It’s a supremely inelegant way to travel.I even attempt some snorkelling when it’s raining, figuring I'm already wet anyway.

National Park of American Samoa,"This national park includes a few nice trails and beaches. The staff at the headquarters are very nice and helpful. However, it has not been setup very well yet (limited turnouts, bins, ...). The fact that many of the trails entail asking for custom authorization to pass, the menace of stray dogs mean that it is not like most other national parks. The Mount Alava hike is well cleared (its a 4x4 road), gets a bit muddy after rain, is mostly a bush walk as the only real reward and view comes at the top.","July 29, 2017",Nice setting but limited setup,2,"Los Angeles, California",3
National Park of American Samoa,"This park must be seen to be believed. It is not so much a park in the mainland sense of the term as it is a huge chunk of the main island of the country.

National Park of American Samoa,"There are two primary entrances to the National park. If you choose the one downtown (near the Park office), you are in for a very long hike to the scenic overlook (the map says 2.5 miles, but it's more like 4 up and down miles to get to the overlook). The trail can get very slippery if it's rained, so be ready to get a little muddy. A much easier (as in, 10 minutes, max) walk is accessible from a different road on the other side of the harbor. Either way, the scenery is spectacular -- fruit bats, coconut crabs, and enormous frogs abound.","March 2, 2017","Great park, but check the map!",25,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",4

National Park of American Samoa,"On a quest to see all our National Parks, here in American Samoa we met our goal. The park service has teamed up with a great outiftter to make the most remote of all our parks more accessible.Led by Chief Pika Taliva'a of Aunu'u, we spent 8 days seeing all three island sections of the park, those on Tutuila, Ofu, and Ta'u. We received more personal ranger attention here than any other park we've visited. Special thanks to Rangers Pua, Rick, and Pai.Some things to know: - This is an island park, bring your own snorkeling gear as rentals may not be available. - Use a guide especially for inter island trips as Samoan custom might allow locals to bump you off flights, despite reserved seats. We know couples this happened to.- Check alerts. Zika and dengue are present on the islands.That said, you'l find deserted beaches, decent hikes, great reef and snorkeling, and friendly Rangers and staff. While in the islands don't miss whale watching, cultural events, and local history. We were given a historical tour of the naval base area, participated in an Ava Ceremony, and had demonstrations of traditional dance, as well as being offered traditional food.This is not an easy park to get to and you should read up on local customs like curfew. Also, take extra cash as the NP and local Farmer's Market are cash only.","November 5, 2016",Go with Off the Beaten Path,212,Colorado,5

National Park of American Samoa,I have now visited all the National Parks in the U.S. including American Samoa. The NPS headquarters were very helpful; however the trails are poorly maintained and very dangerous to meander. They are also very hard to find with poor signs and identification. I have been to all the NP in the U.S. and this is absolutely the most inadequate maintenance and upkeep of all the NP system in the U.S. I hope these trails are available for future generations. The most disheartening trail led me to the gunneries of WWII and this trail will not be available for the public to access in the future due to very poor trail conditions. It was dangerous for me to walk this trail due to the wooden steps that are rotting and very unstable. I think the NPS is putting more money in the marine experience and less in the trail system.

They have miles of trails, but renting a car and driving is best, in our opinion, especially as we only had a few hours when the ship was in port.","September 4, 2015",Beautiful Park,669,"British Columbia, Canada",5
National Park of American Samoa,"This is an American National Park, but the service and friendliness of the staff far exceeded any experience we have had in a National Park on the mainland. The main office in Pago Pago is on the corner of a large building across the street from a gas station. They have very nice educational displays and items for purchase. The highlight of our trip to American Samoa was our time on Ofu Island and our interactions with the park rangers there - Visa and John. They really gave us the VIP service! Contact the National Park of Samoa via email prior to your visit to set up a guided hike.","August 14, 2015",Best park visit ever!,28,Wyoming,5

National Park of American Samoa,"Really a drive-through park - we rented a car and drove the island and went through the park. A few displays but mostly kick-butt scenery! Very pretty drive and it rained most of the time! The absolute best thing about the park was the NPS ranger in the visitor center, he was a font of information about what to do and in what order, where to eat etc...Good job!","June 3, 2015",Pretty drive & scenery!!,96,California,4

National Park of American Samoa,"This is the 59th National Park and if you are in American Samoa it is a must-see. The most remote of all the National Parks, it also has the least services. I searched for the visitor center-of which there is a sign on the main road Hwy 1, but never could find it. The park is accessible from Hwy 5 which brings you to the Trail-head of Tumu Mountain Trail it starts right near the sign on the road and winds up an old road along the ridge for 5 1/2 miles, about 9 km round trip. There is a brochure noting the hikes. There are mountain and beach hikes, short and long, easy to difficult at http://www.nps.gov/npsa/planyourvisit/upload/Day-Hikes-SB_NPSA_high-res.pdf . There are no fees. Bring lots of water, mosquito spray and sunblock. Don't hike the mountains if its rainy the rains are impressive and getting washed off a mountain can't be fun. The sun is hot this close to the equator and the mosquitos carry mosquito borne illness chikungunya, dengue and zika. There are no services but the park can arrange what they call ""home stay"" in which you are given hotel-like accommodations with a Samoan family. If you are not that adventurous and want to arrange a hike through a service there is a brochure http://www.americansamoa.travel/sightseeing and local Resident Rory West advertises a guide service 684-258-3527 or 684-644-1317 (saw at the hotel did not use this service). You can contact the park service by email or phone http://www.nps.gov/npsa/contacts.htm","March 28, 2015",Indescribably Beautiful,197,Honolulu,5
National Park of American Samoa,"I was in town for business, and didn't get a chance to eplore the park much, aside from driving through on the main road towards the village of Vatia. This was a beautiful drive though, and I'm definitely glad I did it. Pola island (i think that's what it was called) is beautiful, which I could've explored it up closer.","September 28, 2014",A beautiful day trip!,37,"Longmont, Colorado",5
National Park of American Samoa,"This is a beautiful national park on a beautiful island. The staff at the National Park Visitor Center are very helpful and informative. The trails are very rough, steep with rocks and roots. However, the park service rates them moderate which is about right. ","September 8, 2014",Beautiful rainforest,366,"Alamogordo, New Mexico",4
