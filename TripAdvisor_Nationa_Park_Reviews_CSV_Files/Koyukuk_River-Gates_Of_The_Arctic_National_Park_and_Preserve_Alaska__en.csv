Koyukuk River,"My wife and I travelled by road along the banks of the North Fork Koyukuk River between the Dalton Highway and Wiseman during our escorted ‘Natural Wonders of Alaska’ tour with Titan Travel. We were based for 3 nights on a room only basis at the welcoming and comfortable Bridgewater Hotel, Fairbanks, located on the banks of the Chena River. We went on an optional evening excursion with Northern Alaska Tour Company on an Air Arctic 8 seater aircraft from Fairbanks over the Brooks Range and the Yukon River (as well as over the Arctic Circle!) to Coldfoot and then by road along the Dalton Highway to the small village of Wiseman. As we flew north to land at Coldfoot, our knowledgeable pilot and guide drew our attention to the Koyukuk River which flows through a section of the Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve. He explained through our headphones that the river is a 425 mile tributary of the Yukon River and Jack Reakoff, our guide during our visit to Wiseman, explained that the North Fork at over 100 miles long is one of the principal forks of the Koyukuk River, Both also explained more about the Gates of the Arctic created as a national park and preserve in the 1980s and now protecting over 8 million acres. It's home to a variety of plants especially trees which include aspen, birch and black and white spruce. Wildlife such as brown and black bears, caribou, Dall's sheep, fox, moose, muskox, wolf and wolverine thrive within this vast park. During our visit to the Wiseman Historical Museum, Jack Reakoff had on display some of the skins, antlers and horns of the animals found along the banks of the river and within the park. The river's name Koyukuk derived from the Central Yup’ik phrase kuik-yuk, meaning a river and the park's name came from a Robert Marshall who travelled the area extensively between 1929 and 1939. He referred to two of the peaks within the central Brooks Range, Frigid Crags and Boreal Mountain, as the gates into the Arctic north. It was wonderful to experience a bird's eye view from our aircraft of this fast flowing river and the vast Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve and to learn more about this wild part of Alaska from Jack Reakoff and from our pilot. This excellent excursion with the Northern Alaska Tour Company enabled me to visit places I would not have seen nor experienced otherwise during my tour of Alaska.","April 7, 2017",Breathtaking views of this fast flowing river and the surrounding wilderness,1223,"Llanbedr, United Kingdom",5
