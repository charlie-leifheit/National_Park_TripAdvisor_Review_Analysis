National Park Underwater Trail,"Lots of small fish, saw a stingray. It was little. Lots of coral. Not always easy to manuevre. The markers are in a triangle. If there are waves, it is not easy to stay on course. I am not an experienced snorkeler. Being terrified of sharks, I had asked the ladies at the visitor center about sharks. They said they are not aware of any incidents, so I kept looking up out of the water to make sure I did not see any arms wailing above the water. As long as other people we're close by, I felt safe. But the best snorkeling was at Buck Island Reef National Monument at Christiansted, St Croix. Maho Beach has turtles cruising the seaweed beds.","August 26, 2019","Colorful fish, no rope",197,"Shelby Township, Michigan",5
National Park Underwater Trail,"We were one of the first to arrive here in the morning and brought our dingy onto the beach. We had the beach to ourselves and had a nice snorkel in the park. Was here in 1995 and there seem to be more fish then. Several people said the coral has been damaged by the hurricane, which is too bad. They have a nice bar and public showers and restrooms. There is also a snack bar that served yummy chicken salad wraps and hot dogs. ","July 28, 2019",Great stop at the Underwater Trail! ,5,"Scottsdale, Arizona",5

National Park Underwater Trail,"Located at Trunk Bay National Park this is a good starting point for new or experienced snorkelers. Unfortunately, the coral was damaged from the hurricanes in 2017 and, although very nice, it is not the same experience that it was a previously. The trail is nice and relatively short, and there are a fair number of fish, but as others have indicated, the coral is not very healthy. The beach is great and large with soft white sand but the shade trees are mostly gone. You no longer can rent snorkel equipment here.

National Park Underwater Trail,"This underwater trail consists of about 5 or 6 informational signs underwater that give information about the reef and wildlife. It is much like a marked trail you might see anywhere else in the US except it is underwater. The reef is filled with life. We saw huge schools of small fish (I have no idea what they were) and then larger predators like yellow tailed snapper and barracuda. We saw an octopus and a jellyfish and we heard others saying they saw a turtle, but we missed seeing him! ","June 29, 2018",Fun!,27,"Severna Park, Maryland",5

National Park Underwater Trail,"I was disappointed in the trail. Maybe I was expecting more, but the plaques were ok. The change of the coral is noticeable here as it is globally.

National Park Underwater Trail,"We booked this excursion from the cruise ship which docked at St. Thomas. After enjoying a 30-40 min. ride on sight-seeing type power boat across the water to St. John, we transferred to a roomy open air taxi for the ride to Trunk Bay. The tour guide was friendly and informative. Once there, we received a very informative explanation of the ecology of the bay and how to properly enjoy the underwater snorkel trail from Dave with OneHornButtFish. We had 1-2 hours to enjoy the secluded beach and snorkel, seeing lots of fish and coral formations.

National Park Underwater Trail,"The trail itself is sort of boring but if you try to follow it, you'll be fairly close to a very nice part of the reef with all sorts of fish & sea coral. So you end up just doing your own thing and not really paying that much attention to the trail (even though I was specificIy looking for the trail, I probably wouldn't have even found it if I wasn't with someone else who noticed the first marker).

National Park Underwater Trail,"The trail markers are overgrown and sometimes difficult to read. My daughter, son and I snorkeled the trail and my son and I ventured around the entire Trunk Cay. We were the 3rd, 4th and 5th persons in the water and it was fantastic. We hit the water about 7:45AM and were virtually alone. After about an hour of exploring we headed around the Cay in a counter-clockwise direction. When we rounded the point and headed back to shore we couldn't believe how many snorkelers had joined us! The cruisers had arrived. We recommend picking a day the ships aren't in port or like us, arriving early. We were out of the water around 10AM and had a great time. Even on days when ships are in port, if you're a moderate to strong swimmer, hang out on the point at the drop off and you'll see less people and more sizable marine life. We saw several sting ray and a nurse shark at the point - awesome spot. And to avoid disappointment for all the snorkel community: remember, it's a top ten BEACH destination in the world and not a top ten snorkel destination.

National Park Underwater Trail,"We absolutely loved Trunk Bay; it's beautiful, but the so-called underwater Trail did not add to our experience. Most of the placards were impossible to read and were in poor shape. This did not deter us from enjoying the snorkeling there, however. The map we had illustrated all the different wildlife we would find in the water, as well as the coral.

Toodling around the trail finding the underwater plaques and seeing actual sea life depicted in the underwater pictures was relaxing and quite fun. I had no expectations going in and had a fabulous time snorkeling here. I saw more types of coral here than I've seen in other exotic places.

The underwater trail itself gives the snorkeler maybe a dozen underwater stone markers to follow which have written explanations on them of what you can expect to see (written in English). The actual reef is heavily trafficked and therefore has probably endured more wear and tear than some others on the island, but I would still call it good... just don't get your expectations high thinking that you'll be swimming amidst large schools of colorful fish.

National Park Underwater Trail,"As far as I know, this is the only marked underwater trail in the world and has a number of interpretive signs underwater describing what one is seeing as they snorkel between three buoys. The trail is located at the eastern end of the spectacular, world class Trunk Bay Beach between the shore and the small island of Trunk Cay and is marked by three different colored buoys. Perhaps because I have spent many hours snorkeling tropical reefs around the world, I found most of the trail to be underwhelming even though the signs were of some interest. The one exception was the area around the second, red buoy near Trunk Cay; this part had some exceptional Elkhorn coral and an abundance of colorful reef fish; this spot alone makes the trail worthwhile and the reason for my recommendation. While I would probably not go out of my way for the Underwater Trail, I certainly would go out of my way to visit the picture perfect tropical beach at Trunk Bay and if one has any interest in snorkeling, you should give the unique trail a try while there.

Here the crystal clear, calm water of the Caribbean Sea shimmers in glorious hues of turquoise and aqua blue while just off shore, a rugged island topped in greenery, beacons the snorkeler to swim out and explore the tropical underwater life that lives in the reef around it.  Just off the shores of this exquisite beach and marked by round buoys is a well-known underwater snorkel trail. Here you will find at least 13 underwater signs with pictures and descriptions providing information about the reef and identifying different coral, urchins and fish that you may see in that area. This was a unique adventure which allowed us to explore what’s below the waters surface. We did not see any exotic marine life such as barracuda’s, stingrays, sharks, turtles, octopus or eels, but we did see some colourful fish, sea urchins and a variety of coral.

You can walk straight in off the beach and swim in relatively shallow water to examine coral reefs and the fish inhabiting the area. We explored around several rocky islands just off the beach, but were off limits to pedestrians. There are some plaques underwater that label a few species of fish and coral that are present.

The truth is, unless you are a very strong swimmer, be careful taking two young ones with you alone. Especially if one becomes nervous and panicky. This is how I ended up on shore.

Bough a year pass at Trunk Bay for the family. National Park pass is not accepted. The displays were not much to remember either. The trails are in good shape and I did a few miles on the trail system at the various historic spots around the island. We did some snorkeling at some of the beaches as well.

National Park Underwater Trail,"Not very exciting, but an easy swim for beginners. Pretty beach. Safe.","January 26, 2012",Nice idea,6,W-S NC,3
National Park Underwater Trail,"The reef here is not as good as Waterlemon, Hawksnest, Salt Pond, or even Caneel. But it is an easy access, and there are lifeguards. Thus, it is the kind of place you can let your 12-year old daughter tackle if she's new to snorkeling. The corals are pretty, and there are a lot of fish visible in clear water.","January 5, 2012",Good snorkeling intro,83,"Bethesda, MD",4
National Park Underwater Trail,"The coral reef is not the most colorful, but it is very easy snorkeling and right at the beach ! ","January 1, 2012",Only underwater trail I have seen,15,"Cary, North Carolina",4
National Park Underwater Trail,"We thought the underwater trail would be hokey and overcrowded, but it was actually fun and there was quite a bit to see, especially if you go slightly off the trail toward the rocks where the shy fish tend to stay.","December 12, 2011",Fun snorkeling spot,228,Philadelphia,4
National Park Underwater Trail,This was the first time I ever snorkeled and it was the perfect place to learn. Calm water and the trail was cool!,"December 6, 2011",First time snorkeling,15,,4
National Park Underwater Trail,"In the beginning of learning to snorkel, or of discovering St John, this is a great experience. Advanced snorkellers will find it crowded and less positive. The markers are fairly well maintained, and there are always a variety of fish present. The coral has suffered, as is true everywhere. The beach is beautiful, but can be very crowded, especially when there are cruise ships on St Thomas. Go early or late to avoid the cruise ship crowds. If your first visit to St John, Trunk is worth the small fee.","November 28, 2011","Excellant, especially for beginners",10,"Miami Shores, Florida",4
National Park Underwater Trail,"Like any popular attraction this can get so crowded you are not going to have fun. Check local papers for cruise ship schedules...go on the days with fewest cruise ships on St Thomas. They come over in droves and most do a loop that includes Trunk Bay, Bordeaux Mtn and North Shore views.It is very pretty but very popular.","October 18, 2011",Only go on non cruise ship days,170,United States,3
National Park Underwater Trail,"Traveled with my 9 and 11-yr old. We all enjoyed the signs provided underwater so we know what we were seeing. We spotted a myriad of coral and brightly colored fish. The length of the trail was just right for most swimming abilities. If you are an experienced snorkeler, the trail is pretty basic. But, I've never seen anything like it on the mainland U.S., so it was exciting for this Midwestern Family!","July 25, 2011",Excellent snorkel for beginners!,87,"Normal, Illinois",5
National Park Underwater Trail,"This trail is great snorkeling for beginners as the underwater signs explain the fish and coral you are viewing, and you feel really safe swimming out not far from the beach. We also rented equipment on the beach for a few dollars. We were there on a day the beach was empty (Memorial Day), so it was great snorkeling for my friends who were beginners. I thought the coral was in decent shape for such a popular beach, but obvioulsy there are a million more advanced and undiscovered areas around the islands. Overall, I was really impressed with this National Park and think they're doing a great job of preserving this beautiful island! See my review for Trunk Beach.","September 7, 2007",Great for Beginner Snorkeling!,21,"Chicago, Illinois",5
National Park Underwater Trail,"This stop was a great part of our trip, and I really enjoyed the underwater trail to follow. As a new snorkler, this was a definate bonus for someone who isn't that comfortable in the water, and there were plenty of other people around if you got into trouble! I would strongly suggest going to Ocean World over on St. Thomas before learning to snorkel....you will find out a lot about the things you might see. I think I would have watched more and been more patient if I would have gone there first!","June 28, 2007",Great for newbies!,22,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",4
