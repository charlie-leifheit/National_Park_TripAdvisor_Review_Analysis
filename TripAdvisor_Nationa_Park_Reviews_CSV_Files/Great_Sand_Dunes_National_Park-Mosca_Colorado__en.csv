Great Sand Dunes National Park,"From a distance, one can see what nature can provide. During our road trip of Southern Colorado we went from Colorado Springs to Canyon City onto Great Sand Dunes. It was a long drive as we ended up in Pagosa Springs. Another review. This park reveals a large sand dune with a trickle of the spring waters at the basin. It was a sight to behold. Great picnic area (beware of the mosquito). Great trails and worthwhile visitor's center.","October 18, 2019",Well worth the drive,1,,5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"An amazing sight to see massive San Dunes in the middle of the mountains, you need to wear sensible shoes to help with the walk to the dunes and take your water to stay hydrated, its just breathtaking to see what mother nature can create, a great place for sand sleds and just walking or sitting and taking in the views from the top of the dunes.I would recommend this for a day trip if you are in the area.","October 9, 2019",Nature at its best,2,"Melbourne, Australia",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Dunes National Park just 20 mi West and 20 mi North of Alamosa, Colorado is wild open country must see terrain for the world or USA traveler. Below the 14,000 ft Mt. Blanca And Mt. Crestone this is a sight to behold. Vast vistas take your - or my- breath away.","October 8, 2019",Big high huge sand dunes,2,United States,4
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We stopped at the Great Sand Dunes National Park driving from Mesa Verde to Denver. All we had time for was taking the walk up from the parking lot to the dunes, but that was plenty. Great views of the dunes. And pretty cool climbing up some of the way to get a different look. Really something unique.","October 6, 2019",Amazing Site,181,NJ,4
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"You can see the dunes from very far away and they look so odd, you can't believe that they are real. They're completely out of place compared to the surrounding landscape. And they look kind of small from far away. Just wait until you get up close! They're HUGE! Truly an amazing sight, and fascinating to learn about why they are there, how the confluence of just the right conditions makes these sand dunes so enormous practically in the middle of nowhere. This must have been a truly bizarre sight to travelers in the past. It's like coming upon a glacier in the middle of the Amazon rain forest. If you like hiking and have the time, then this is a good place for climbing up the dunes. They take longer than you think to explore them. Don't bother bringing your own sled from home or a piece of cardboard - the don't work for sliding down the dunes. You must use special kinds of sleds that work on this type of sand, and they don't rent them at the Dunes park, you have to rent/purchase them outside of the park. If you don't like hiking, it's still an interesting thing to walk out to the nearest dune and watch the other folks sledding and climbing, bring binoculars so you can see the folks who are trying to get to the top of the dunes very far away. We were there for about an hour and that was long enough to see everything and do what we wanted to do, so it's a nice side trip, but don't make this your end-all, be-all destination. I would think this place would be better suited to be a national monument instead of a national park. Kind of like Devil's Tower, unless you're a climber, you pretty much just stand around and look at it for awhile. Still, we found the Rangers there very helpful and knowledgeable about the area, it was fun watching the dogs and kids play in the sand, fun to watch the folks who didn't have the right sleds try to get down a dune and fail, and we had great weather. It's beautiful in the sunshine, and it wasn't too hot or cold, but WINDY!","October 5, 2019","Should Be A National Monument Instead of National Park, But Still Wonderful!",105,Wisconsin,4
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This is such an interesting place! Knowledgeable staff, short movie in the visitor center. We crossed over to the dunes, took photos but didn't attempt the climb. ","September 29, 2019","Wow, this is amazing!",30,"Quincy, Illinois",5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Camped here, pretty spot, developed with bathrooms, etc. got up before sunrise, hiked to dune top, exhausting but worth the effort. Don’t hike in the afternoon, too hot. Small, simple visitor center. Lots of services in nearby Alamosa. I took a side trip to Zapata Falls, very pretty but a very rough, long road up.Not a must see national park, but worth a visit.","September 19, 2019",Worth a trip,158,Idaho,4

Great Sand Dunes National Park,This was one of the most beautiful places I have been too. We were lucky enough to bag a camp site within the sand dunes park so had great views from the van. We were close to the various trails & opted to take a walk out towards the sand dunes at dusk. I took my Native American Indian flute which I am learning to play & we sat on a sand dune as the sunset. Walking back across the sand in the dark we could hear the call of the wild coyote in the hills & later saw many stars in the night sky.,"September 10, 2019",The lilt of a native flute & the song of a wild coyote ,23,United Kingdom,5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"The park isn't near any towns, so go in prepared with a picnic and plenty of water. There's a gift shop with snacks, but if you want to really spend some time (and you will), bring food and water. There are several nice picnic areas with shade. The gift shop has a nice video explaining how the dunes were formed. The best time to visit the dunes is in Spring or early Summer, when Medano Creek is flowing. You get the benefit of both the dunes, and playing in the water. While I've seen people bring water toys, I discourage it. The water is very shallow, and it's windy. I saw several parents chasing blowup toys. Sand buckets and shovels are good. There were a lot of dogs playing in the water, so bring them, but keep in mind that outside the water, the ground is very hot. The temperature on the dunes can reach 120 degrees. Hot sand! One popular activity is sliding down the dunes. Outside the park you can rent sleds, but several people were using cardboard and having just as much fun. If you plan to hike the dunes, wear closed toed shoes, and carry in water. I wore my water shoes in the creek and on the dunes. I went on a Wednesday in June, and had a wonderful, uncrowded day. My friend went the next weekend, and she waited in a hot line of cars for over an hour just to enter the park. I suggest calling and asking about the number of visitors on the day you choose. Remember sunblock, water, and food, and you can spend a fabulous day here.","September 10, 2019","Must GO, but go prepared! Sunblock, water, and a change of clothes.",3,"Coal Creek, Colorado",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"It’s a long drive, from anywhere. As you approach there is a feeling of, wow. Part of the wow is we made it and the other part is that is amazing.The parking lot was crowded and required a bit of pluck. Once on the river it was nice and the cool stream and air was refreshing. There were mosquitoes that could attach and bite despite the brisk breeze, but if you took care you could avoid them. The overall feeling on the stream bed was that many people having a good time in nature. It was almost like the crowd vibe when watching the solar eclipse. We headed up the dunes and it wasn’t long before I was running back to the water; I burned my feet in the hot sand. Yet another mind boggling moment, sand that was like 140 F. The dunes are harder to climb than you might imagine; about 4 times more effort than a usual hill. Overall it was an experience filled with wonder and interesting realizations.If you are on the edge of decision, go. Plan for crowds, wear insect repellent on your legs, have shoes and wear them in the sand, bring water. And the visitor center has zero food and beverage. “Go to the Oasis”... was the advise.","September 8, 2019",Kind of awe inspiring,21,"Boulder, Colorado",4
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Make sure you get the sand boards, which are available just before the main enterance to the park. Prices were reasonable. It is a little tiring walking up the dunes, but we all had a great time. Try to avoid arriving after mid day, as the sand gets quite hot.","September 8, 2019",Sand dunes,4,"Miami, United States",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"I thought I did research on this place, but apparently not. I was thinking the park was much larger and one could drive farther in. Had I known how close the dunes were to the entrance, we could have gone later in the day when we arrived in the area, instead of leaving early in the morning to beat the heat. Oh well.We got to the visitor's center around 7:50am. They didn't open til 8:30j. We wandered around behind the center a bit, drove to a nearby campground to use their rest rooms, came back & joined the growing crowd waiting for the visitor's center to open. I was still thinking we had to drive farther into the park to access the dunes. When the center finally opened up, we figured out that to access the dunes one only needed to drive about 1/2 mile beyond the center and park. Had we known that ahead of time we could have started walking at 7:50 instead of 8:45. Oh well.None of the other park roads besides this and the campground are accessible by non 4-wheel drive vehicles.The river was dry at this time of year. It would be a fun thing to see when it is running.The walk is strenuous for a 60+ overweight heart patient. Totally worthwhile even tough we didn't get very far. We only walked up the first dune we came to and down the other side & back. I was still able to get some great pictures. I wish we would have come earlier & started walking right away instead of waiting for the visitor center to open. Or maybe came the night before to check out the stars. It sounds like the park is far off the main road, but really the drive goes fast, and we could have done both. We spent the night in Alamosa.","September 5, 2019",Once In A Lifetime Experience,69,"Marshfield, Wisconsin",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,What an awesome park. What a wonder how these dunes were created.We found out that God created them for sand boarding. What a fun day!,"September 4, 2019",Sand boarding the dunes,0,,5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We stopped at the visitor centre to use the restrooms and fill up our water bottles, they have a little shop in there where we bought an energy bar, which was actually delicious.You have to get back in the car to drive a couple of minutes to another carpark if you want to see the dunes closer (or climb them as we did).Once you park the car and approach the dunes you need to walk across a (super shallow) river which runs over sand so we took our shoes off. The mountains and dunes with the water is amazing, we got some great photos!Climbing the dunes is hard work, it's hot, windy and obviously uphill but on sand, so every step has resistance. Your shoes will be covered in, and have sand inside them when you're done. We wore hiking boots for ankle support.You definitely need water and if I were doing it again I would consider something to cover my ears as the wind started to hurt after a while (but I'm sensitive to that, my husband was fine).All in all, we probably spent a couple of hours there (including time at the visitor centre).","September 3, 2019",Very photogenic!,13,,5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Such a beautiful National Park! Smaller park and smaller visitor center than many national parks, but still a wonderful place to visit. It gets hot quickly out on the sand dunes, so if you want to walk up them go early in the morning. Plus there is no shade, so wear hats and bring water bottles. The sand is challenging to walk on so we didn't make it up to the very top of the dunes like we'd hoped but we still enjoyed the experience and the view. Also, this park has an amazing dark sky with minimal light pollution, so go outside at night and look at the stars and milky way. That might have been our favorite part!","August 28, 2019",Beautiful National Park,0,,4
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"When you think of Colorado, you think of mountains, trees, lakes, rivers etc. We visited the Dunes while doing some other excursions, like a blues concert in Trinidad and taking the Rio Grande train from Ft Garland to a concert in the mountains. Seeing the dunes was like seeing a desert in the oasis; if you didn't see the mountains and trees nearby, you might think you were in Egypt. We visited August 24 but didn't leave Trinidad as early as we planned, so got there after noon and expected it to be hot. However, it was unseasonably cooler so it wasn't too bad for us older folks. The river was mostly dried up by this time of year; just more of a little mud crossing to get to the dunes. We walked up the smaller dune, but didn't do any sand boarding - that would not have been a pretty picture of me falling off my board and getting sand up all my crevices. But there were plenty of people who did make the trek up to the mid and high dunes; lots of families there too. Many people boarding the dunes and having a great time. We then went to one of the trail heads nearby and did a short fairly easy hike in the forested area. Overall, we enjoyed this trip and would recommend it, especially for families.","August 26, 2019",Like a desert in the oasis,4,"Woodland Park, Colorado",4
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We made the drive down from Denver to see the park and hike the dunes. We arrived mid-afternoon on a hot day and proceeded to hike up to the right of the dunes as you come upon them and then zig-zagged our way up. It’s challenging at times but worth it when you get to the top. I’d love to come back for a sunset, sunrise, or to stargaze. It was stunning!","August 24, 2019","Gorgeous scenery, great leg workout!",7,"Edmonton, Canada",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This attraction is a must see. It seems so out of place in the mountains, but definitely worth the short drive off the main highway. You have to rent sleds outside the park. Go early in the day if you go in the summer, as the sand is very hot. ","August 22, 2019",Must see,0,,4
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Did a trek to High Dune in the early morning to avoid the heat. It was very hard but well worth it. Rented a sled from the nearby Oasis (just outside the park). It is basically $20 for a day rental. Took it back to the dunes and enjoyed sledding down the various dunes. We all had a great time with that. The river was still running but was pretty low. It was still fun to see all the very young kids playing in it.Great Sand Dunes is an awesome park for all ages. I highly recommend it.Only complaint was that even in early August, they had no ranger programming on weekdays and the campsite store (to buy firewood, etc...) was closed. It seemed like it was off-season in that sense, and I can't say the first few days in August should be that.","August 20, 2019",Wonderful adventure at Great Sand Dunes,9,"Burnsville, Minnesota",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Out in the middle of nowhere, about 30-45 minutes from Alamosa and Fort Garland, we didn't think we'd be impressed by a bunch of sand dunes. They were the highlight of our trip.The visitor center is surprisingly good for such a remote location. Besides having the key necessities like bathrooms and water, there are plenty of informative displays, a nice viewing area of the dunes, and a small gift shop. You can get a Junior Range badge if your family collects them.The parking lot to hike to the dunes is a quick 2 minute drive from the visitor center. To get to an actual dune requires walking through a little river and then maybe a 1/4 mile hike through coarse sand before actually getting to something you can climb. From then on, it's up to you whether to climb a small dune or to do something more ambitious. It took us an hour of difficult hiking (like being on a non-stop stairclimber machine) to get to the highest peak in the park -- well worth it at sunrise to see the light and shadows on the whole dune landscape. We hiked in bare feet so that we weren't collecting sand in our shoes. The best part is sliding down the dunes. You can rent sandboards at Oasis (on the right just before the ranger station), in Alamosa, or in Blanca/Fort Garland. One board is probably enough for a family because it's exhausting climbing up a dune after every run. Just make sure to rub wax on the board after each time or the board won't slide at all. Trying to slide on cardboard or plastic bags doesn't work: we saw several unsuccessful attempts!Because the park is open 24/7 and the sand gets very hot at midday, early morning or early evening are best. You'll avoid crowds and to have the best scenery for photos. If it's windy though, look out -- the sand will sting!","August 20, 2019",magnificent sight -- but truly a long hike to get to the top of the dunes,21,"Wilmington, Delaware",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We visited the Great Sand Dunes MANY years ago, and it was a must see on this trip. The whole experience of the massive dunes and great visitor center made it a good choice. We senior citizens enjoyed watching the young families have such good fun, as we had when we took a young family there a long time ago.","August 19, 2019",Return visit,1,,5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,Before getting to the park there is a turn out to the East for Zapata Falls. The road is a rough three miles than can be covered in a car if needed. Half mile walk back to the falls. Worth the walk. Stream is cold and felt great. ,"August 18, 2019",Zapata Falls. ,12,"Emporia, Kansas",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Such an interesting place to visit. Although it was crowded, we go there early and there was no wait to get in. There was enough water running to cool off in, and it was a blast watching people of all ages try sledding down the sand.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,Great Sand Dunes National Park may not be the biggest park but to me it was the most interesting geographically and the fact that you can explore it any way you want 24/7 makes it a lot of fun as opposed to the highly restricted parks where you can't leave the trail.,"August 18, 2019",Possibly the coolest National Park,56,"Wayne, Pennsylvania",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We spent about 2 hours driving through and stopping at the Visitors’ Center. We also visited the dunes and the somewhat dry creek bed. There is an outdoor shower to remove sand after you trek the dunes. It was fairly hot in August, so we were glad to have an early morning visit. The sand can become extremely hot as the day progresses. Bring plenty to drink and lots of sunscreen! There is very little shade.","August 17, 2019",Great Sand Dunes Park is beautiful!,12,"Midlothian, Texas",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Unfortunately our only visit to this unique park was negatively impacted by the unusually large swarms of mosquitos and sand fleas. My wife is highly allergic to insect bites, so we were restricted to indoor activities and auto touring.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This is a new experience for many. There is a shop nearby in a small town where you can rent Sand boards and sleds. The Sand Dunes are large and provide many opportunities for all to Sand board or sled down the Dunes. It is best to go when it is not so hot though as I heard the sand gets very hot. We were there in the morning and it was great. It is not a place you will only spend a few minutes at, so plan to stay here awhile. But well worth the side trip. Also best to go early as parking gets to be a problem and there are long lines to get into the park. It is a national park, so there is a fee. Would go back, especially if you have teens or children.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This place is in the middle of nowhere. We drove from Salida for a day trip and you could see the sand from miles away which is pretty cool. Just before entering the park, you'll find a restaurant/activity center that you can rent sleds. We had two kids so rented two sleds. First mistake. One to share would have been just fine. I'm glad we went and we had fun on a beautiful day, but now that I've seen it, I don't think I'd return unlike so many other spectacular national parks.","August 14, 2019",Very Interesting,11,"Denver, Colorado",3

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This place is unusual in how it was created, and has an uncommon beauty all its own. Be sure to stop in at the visitor center to learn about the multiple ecosystems and their interactions.I came to see the dunes, but found that walking across the creek to get to the dunes was a lot of fun, too. While there are times that the creek is dry, it wasn’t when we were there and the steady but shallow flow was refreshingly cool and created interesting patterns in the creek bed.The dunes themselves are remarkable, and you really don’t appreciate their size unless you look at the tiny dots that are people climbing and walking on them. If you are in good shape and properly equipped, you can walk up a long way. If you want a less strenuous experience, you can walk up a short way and still enjoy the dunes.I had to try sand sledding, an enormously popular activity here, and rented a sled at the shop just outside the park entrance. Well, I wasn't much good at it but it was fun anyway. If you prefer not to get sand in your hair and just about everywhere else, you might pass on this. (Sand gets into everything from your knees down whether you sled or not.)Be sure to come prepared with the obvious stuff—sunscreen, a change of footwear and other clothing, sunglasses, a hat, and water; insect repellent is also helpful especially around the creek.","July 21, 2019","Amazing, unique place",610,"DeWitt, New York",5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,We visited over the 4th of the July weekend. The dunes are very impressive and fun to sled. Be sure to rent the wooden boards. We saw others who brought their own plastic sleds and they just don't work. We got to the park around 10:30 and waited 30 minutes in traffic to get through the park gate. I recommend getting there earlier as the sand gets blazing hot by around noon. Highly recommend wearing socks to keep your feet from burning up. We left by 12:30 as it was just too hot on the sand and climbing the dunes in the heat is tiring.The highlight of our trip was stopping at Zapata Falls on the way out of the park.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,If you’re in the area this is an impressive stop. It’s amazing to see this much sand accumulated in an otherwise mountainous valley. Not overly hot. We rented sand sled from the Oasis just before entering the park. It was great fun but exhausting to climb the dunes if your out of shape and not used to altitude. It’s worth it though. We rented 3 sleds so we’d each have one. In reality we could have rented 1 and shared.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Our family had fun here, BUT, here are a few things you need to know before your visit:- Pack strong bug spray (mosquitoes around the creek are like crazy mutants, immune to all big sprays except Off deep woods!!)- Pack lots of water to take with you to the dunes. It gets hot an overwhelming very quickly- Wear closed shoes (water shoes or tennis shoes) as sandals are hard to walk in and the sand will burn you like walking on hot coals. Luckily we packed socks (as recommended by Oasis board rentals), because our kids screamed bloody murder the instant they stepped off their boards at the bottom of the hill. Put your socks on first, before starting any activities if you don’t have closed toe shoes. The socks protected our feet with no problems. I’m not sure why the sand here reaches 140 degrees in the sun, but it was hot!- Rent your sled boards at Oasis rentals before getting in line for the park. They are pricy-2 stand up boards and 1 sit down board were $60 for the afternoon. The stand up boards were better-the kids loved them and found them easier not to flip than the sit down boards. Prepare yourself for filling your shirts with sand with the sit down boards. - Don’t plan to spend all day here-it’s super hot and we were exhausted within 2-3 hours. -These dunes are not for the easily tired, non athletic person, we had to stop and rest ALOT and we are fairly athletic and used to hiking. - Don’t go past the first few dunes... the view at the top is just more dunes and you have to go back over all those dunes to get out. Our feet sink down into the sand and the trip up each hill is completely exhausting. We’re glad we went to check this off our bucket list, but we would not go again.","July 16, 2019",Sand Dunes Sledding & Board Rentals,17,"Houston, Texas",4

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We were staying in Colorado Springs for a few days and debated whether to make the 3 hour drive each way to experience this National Park. We are so glad we did! The sand dunes are massive when you finally are up close to them. My husband and I had our 9 and 11 year old children with us, and we hiked the entire way up to the true peak (you have to get to what appears to be the peak, and then realize there is another higher peak behind it!). The kids handled the trek better than we did! I wanted to quit at times, as hiking on steep sand dunes is no joke - Your feet sink in with every step and parts of the dunes can be steep. It’s not easy, but so rewarding once you are at the top! Plan on hiking at least 2 hours if you want to make it to the peak and back down (including time to enjoy the view and take photos at the top). The visitor center has a nice video explaining the site, so including the visitor center, plan on being there at least 3 hours total. No food offerings in the park and not much in the surrounding area, so bring your own. Definitely wear sunscreen, bring water and wear sneakers. ","July 15, 2019",Worth the drive!,26,,5

The line to get in the park is long and slow - for some reason the park service doesn't figure out how to move this process faster. So go early - we went before or at 9 am and waited about 20 minutes. By 11 am the cars were backed up over a mile. In the summer it can get hot so bring plenty of lotion, water and shade.

If you like, stop at the rental shops for a sled which are on the same road and a few minutes drive before the entrance. One can park at the visitor center and walk for several minutes towards the dunes but we opted to go to Medona Pass (picnic area and showers). Available spaces after 2pm and it's closer steps past the cooling shallow waters before one hits the hot scorching sand. Flip flops/sandals were fine along with bringing plenty of water, sunglasses, and a hat. One can easily get dehydrated and there were kind people who offered water but best to bring your own.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"My son, my two grand kids (6 and 8), my daughter and I went to Great Sand Dunes National Park to try sand boarding. My son had gone once, 10 yrs ago. We rented boards in a nearby town. Since it was during the week, crowds were reasonable, and we could park fairly close to the River you must wade across to reach the dunes. The water is cold. It’s important to have foot ware that can take both the water and the sand. We all hiked to one of the nearest dunes with a good slope, waxed the boards well, and gave it a shot. It’s really fun! The kids were unsure at first, but caught on quickly and had a blast. So did my daughter. My son is a snowboarder and skier, so he showed us the techniques to get started. The sand gets really hot, and can burn your feet around mid day. Socks help. Protection for your mouth/nose from the wind is recommended. Sunscreen and long sleeves are good. Leaving the area, we stopped at the gift shop and picked up some souvenirs. I would do this again in a heartbeat, if it weren’t so far from Puerto Rico. If you go, take lots of photos and videos. You’ll catch a lot of smiles.","June 23, 2019",First time sand boarding,8,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",5

Lady was very fast and informative. The dunes were amazing. The campgrounds were full and everything was reserved as we went thru at noon. Toooo bad for us. We had a long walk to the dunes but that was our bad for not gettin there earlier. When you go on the dunes make sure you keep something with you for your feet, as the sand gets very hot. As well as your hat on tight when the wind picks up there is no retrieving your flying belongings. It’s very windy and sand pelts you.

The temperature was a bit cooler than we'd hoped fun but it was still fun. After a few hours, we went to town and got some inflatable tubes for the next day. Day two was warmer and the tubes were a big hit. My husband used some nylon rope to make restraining straps for the tubes.

What a truly amazing place! A must go! We were 3 hours north in Woodland Park, it was definitely worth the early morning and long drive to spend plenty of time in this park. Visitor Center is informative, clean, helpful. The rangers helped steer us away from the typical spot where the bulk of visitors/families/children cross the creek, play in the sand, surf & hike the dunes. After a fun 4-wheel-drive-required ride, we came to a little known parking lot and place to cross and hike with only 2 or 3 other people. Loved it!! Climbing the dunes is very strenuous, but we 4 over60's made it to the top of 1 very tall dune --- definitely well worth all the effort, because you can really see the whole field of dunes.

Only when you look around and see the mountains do you find yourself in the here and now.When your done, go visit Zapata Falls nearby. It's a long bumpy drive and a moderate hike but well worth it.

It was quite cool when we visited & it was not crowded. The dunes are the tallest in North America. It was certainly an unusual sight. If you are in the area you should visit, as you won't see anything like this anywhere else! There were a few people on the dunes when we were there. You had to go across water, which had to be cold this time of the year. In pictures on the brochure it showed many people enjoying the water, apparently in warmer temps! The bottom line is, you think, how did all this sand end up in the mts ? Go, see and enjoy for yourself! The amount of time you spend here depends on how high you want to go up the dunes I believe.

I'd highly recommend wearing water shoes, as passing thru Medano Creek is a must to access some of the easiest ""dune walking"". BTW - the little store near the Great Sand Dunes Lodge sells water shoes. We didn't go out at night because the cloud cover was too great, so we missed the stars. We'll have to come back.

There is a very shallow and wide stream that you will wade across to get to the dunes. If you want to go sledding down the dunes, you can rent a sled outside of the park (there are no rentals at the park - something we did not know).

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Enormous sand dunes at the foot of mountains, miles for any body of open water...something that needs to be seen to be believed. The dunes themselves are very easily accessible from the parking lot just up from the visitor centre. It is worth noting that the hiking trail up the dunes sits the other side of a shallow river that runs in front of them, so to cross it it's advisable to take off socks and boots and go through bare foot before putting socks and shoes back on the other side. There are places that are above boot height, so unless you bring wellingtons (a bit heavy for the rest of the walk) you'll get water in your boots (I speak from experience!) haha. In any case the walk to the top took us about 1.5 hours, although much quicker to come down. Also there are warnings about the temperature of the sand so it's not advisable to walk over the dunes themselves bare foot especially during peak months. We also did the dunes overlook trail which was really nice. You pick it up from the farthest end of the RV park on the right as you walk in the direction away from the parking lot. It took about 2 hours round trip undulating path at first and then a short but steep hike uphill for the view. We saw lots of grazing deer along the path, and because most people are on the dunes it's a very quiet walk - at least it was for us @ 8am during May.

We entered the park around noon and made our way to the Visitor Center which I highly recommend. After lathering up in sunscreen, we headed across the river and out to the dunes. We hiked to the top of High Dune in about 2 hours. The view from of there and all along the way were spectacular. A vast majority of people who were also hiking that day stopped short of the summit of High Dune. Go to the top! The view of the sand fields is amazing. Bring plenty of water and take frequent breaks and you will be able to make it. My wife and I are not in the greatest shape by any stretch of the imagination and we were able to reach the summit without issues. We sat on the top for about an hour watching the shadows from the overhead clouds make patterns on the dune fields before us and then headed down. We stowed our bag and shoes and walked barefoot upstream through the river which was wide and only 2-4” deep and most points. It was a lovely refreshing way to unwind and end a spectacular day. The dunes themselves and impressive and grand in scale and the visual mind game of seeing snow capped mountains a few miles in the background will certainly leave a lasting memory.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"I spent the weekend at the Great Sand Dunes and it was my first time here, and I had so much fun! I highly recommend hiking to the top of Star Dune. You get a view of the whole dune field, which is pretty scenic. I got to the top around noon, but I recommend getting to the top either early in the morning or later in the afternoon because that is was the sun will cast shadows on the dunes and you will get some pretty amazing pictures. I also walked around the dune field and Medano Creek, which was starting to flow. I also hiked to the Ghost Forest by the Escape Dunes. The trails were hard to follow, despite trying to follow the previous hiker's footprints, but seeing the dead and gnarly trees that had bee swallowed by the escape dunes was pretty cool. This park is a great place to go stargazing. I HIGHLY recommend coming here when there is supposed to me no moon and a clear night, because you can see the Milky Way. I'm no expert stargazer, but I went into the park at about 5:00 a.m. Sunday morning and you could see the bright galactic center of the Milky Way. I also saw 3 shooting stars.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"A very unique stop - definitely unexpected in Colorado! The Visitor Centre very helpful. Even in March, the sand was starting to get hot. We underestimated how strenuous the hike to the first dunes would be - walking in sand, uphill, at 7,000' more elevation than we are used too - was definitely a workout.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Sand dunes in the middle of the Colorado mountains. Hard to believe. If you have a four wheel drive, there are things you can do, and there is hiking, also camping. But the main reason people come here are to play in the sand. It is the tallest sand dunes in America. The trail to the top is 3 miles (not sure if that is round trip). Most people don't bother to go to the top. Most come to sled down to the bottom at a point where it is easier to get to. Some have sand boards (similar to surf boards), which they use to ride down. During times of rain, there is a seasonal creek but I did not see it when I went.","March 29, 2019",A Beach Without the Water (seasonally),259,"Clinton, South Carolina",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"I had been to the sand dunes when I was a young girl, but this was a new experience! The weather was not the greatest, a bit windy and cold. The dunes are so impressive, there were many people there, but not crowded. We rented sand sleds in Alamosa, so the grandkids had a great time sledding down the dunes. The climb back up was a bit hard if they went down a sleep incline, but they had a wonderful time!I would love to come in a month or so when the river is flowing. I think each season has its advantages. In the summer, come early, as the sand gets hot midday. While we were there, although the air was cool, the sand was warm.The visitor center is nice, very interesting, and of course, there is a video!

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Just awesome, the family absolutely loved this place. We continue to be blown away by National Parks and this was no exception. We had never heard of this place until we started researching things to do in Southern Colorado. Papa tried to plan and awesome adventure and won! Of course the fails were there too. Again I didn’t plan lunch which got us deep into rural southern Colorado where the pace of service wasn’t accounted for. Again I took the chance to rise above my failure in planning to remain positive and squandered that turning ornery and lamenting the slow service. However all was washed away as we got closer to the dunes. The drive in is surreal as you see something very different on the horizon in front of majestic snow caped mountains. As you get closer they change from ho-hum to amazing. The girls were finally impressed by Colorado looking out the window. The next question are those black dots human? Yes they were as we pulled into the parking lot, with plenty of space due to our November visit, the realization of the size of dunes swept over us. Do you think we will be able to make it to the top? Me looking over at a huge Mount Blanco and figuring it was about half the size, I don’t know but let’s give it a try. As we tumbled out of the car, Mama and I made sure we had plenty of water for the journey. I am not sure how else to prepare for this other than a standard hike other than to say be prepared for sand everywhere. As for the adults high top hiking boots kept the sand infiltration to a minimum, however for the kids regardless of the shoe type, all of which were poor, the sand loaded in. Then we were off headed out over the plain before the dunes which was dry this time of year but flow seasonally with run off. A few hundred yards in, as my most excited daughter and I planned our line of assent, I realized as my boots continue to sink in the soft sand we would not be making the top today. As you will read hiking the ridges is the best plan of attack and when you can finding a line that includes some firmer sand will help. However, as we started the climb we were all hit by the elevation and energy expended by climbing in sand. We had to take breaks every 100 yards once we were into the meat of the climb. Mama and I experienced chest thumping exertion as we plodded along. Finally making it to a peak about 2/3rds up we felt really accomplished and took in the fabulous views.","March 28, 2019",The family absolutely loved this place,26,"Jacksonville, Florida",5

There are many hiking trails and camping spots to love including 4WD vehicle camping, backpacking, and developed camp plots.

The last time I went here, we rented sand boards and a sled, which didn't work super well. It was a little rainy, which may have been part of the problem. The time we went before, we just climbed and slid, and climbed and slid, and climbed and slid. They always remind you to be very conscious of the heat; don't go out in the afternoon heat too far. This last time we also went on a bird walk, which was fun. Probably my favorite part other than just the dunes are the ranger talks.

I would recommend at least a whole day to fully explore the park. As with all US National Parks there is an entrance fee.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"These dunes are a great place to undertake a little known activity of Sand Sledding or Sand Boarding. 1) The park does not rent sleds or boards. The park website that suggests the only 3 stores that rent sleds and boards. One is in Alamosa (30 minutes away) while the second is in Hooper 15 minutes west of the park. The third is right outside the boundaries of the park which is super convenient unless it’s closed for the season which is from November until March/April. 2) Sleds move much faster than the boards. That being said, my 11 and 13 year old had no experience with the boards so the sleds were much easier for them to manage. 3) The sand is soft so it is not horrid when you start going sideways. 4) Steer and brake with your hands. It is counter intuitive because you want to steer with your feet but the nice guy renting our boards warned us when you put your feet in the sand going down a dune, it gives you a sand sandwich. Of course, when speeding down a hill, I put out my feet to stop and did spray sand right into my face.5) If the sand is wet, it creates too much friction on the bottom of the sled so you don't go very far. Head to a drier dune and the sledding will be much more effective!6) I would have never known this. Wax! But don't wax to much. For the sleds, when you look at the bottom of the board, there are screws for the handles and you wax between the handles. That's only about a 6 inch wide by 18 inch wide to wax for the sleds. If you do the front and back of the sled, it makes it ""stick"" to the sand which really complicates the sledding ability!7) Bring clothes to change into. We had sand in places the sun doesn't shine.This is the only place I know of to do Sand Sledding/Boarding!

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Quality and size of the dunes are good. And while unusual in south-central CO, it is logical that sands from further west would accumulate on western slopes of mountains. However, there is virtually nothing to do at this park except for hiking on the dunes. There are other opportunities adjacent in the National Forest. To reach the dunes you must traverse a small stream so be prepared to get wet or remove your footwear.","November 18, 2018",Very little to do,120,"Bowling Green, Kentucky",4

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"The Great Sand Dunes National Park is a beautiful national park that could be fully enjoyed in a one-day visit covering the major attractions in the park. Though the park Visitor Center opens at 9AM, one could go earlier and get familiar with the park and go on some of the shorter hikes before visiting the Visitor Center. The Visitor Center is a worthwhile place by itself – The park movie shows the park in different seasons and is very enjoyable and informative. The information displays and exhibits in the visitor center are quite interesting, especially the topography model of the sand dunes nestled among the mountains. Also, get information on Park Ranger activities scheduled for the day of the visit. I found the Sunset hike with the ranger (2-hr long) to be excellent where the hike goes to the sand dunes called the Escape Dunes which are rarely visited. The sand dunes are enchantingly beautiful in changing light conditions. Also, do not miss walking the short and easy Sand Sheet Loop Trail at the visitor center. Of Course the main activity at the park is hiking the sand dunes, and reaching High Dune is the main objective for the serious hikers (about a 3-hr hike). But hiking even a short distance on the sand dunes is a nice experience for casual hikers. In season (Spring) the Medano Creek will be flowing, but it was not during my visit in October. The park has several forested trails in the Preserve area which includes part of the Sanger de Christo mountains. The other major attraction is Zapata Falls, which is currently located outside the park (3 miles south), but which I understand will be included in the park for future protection. At least two hours will be required to complete the visit to Zapata Falls, which includes driving on a 4-mile long gravel road and about a half mile strenuous hike. A hiking stick will be helpful but not essential when scrambling on rocks while crossing the river to get to the falls.The great Sand Dunes National Park is a beautiful park; make it destination in your travels.","October 16, 2018",One of a Kind,157,"Kansas City, Missouri",5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"National Park number 4, and the last one, on our tour. Headed east out of Durango heading back to Denver and decided to make a stop at the Great Sand Dunes National Park since it was kind of on the way back home.As we got closer we could see the dunes nestled up against the Sangre De Cristo Mountains. They looked close, but we still had 20 plus miles to drive to get to the park entrance.Once there we made the obligatory stop at the visitor center to get some additional information. We decided to go over to the Dunes parking area and do a hike on the sand dunes themselves.The interesting thing about this National Park is that you can actually go out on to the dunes and hike wherever you want. There are no marked trails so you can go anywhere on the dunes. In other National Parks you are supposed to stay on the designated paths...not so here while you are on the dunes.We set out sites on climbing to the highest dune in the park which is named Star Dune which is listed at 755 feet tall. Now at times it may be a little shorter or a little taller all depending how much sand may have accumulated or been removed by the winds.As we started the wind was at our back so the blowing sand was not a big factor. Even though the temperature was 58 degrees when we started I was happy that I had a light down jacket a hat and gloves because standing out on the sand with the wind blowing made it feel much colder.The issue with climbing on sand is that when you take one step forward you seem to slide back half a step which increases the time and work load. We kept climbing and the wind kept blowing and it appeared to be getting stronger as the day continued.Since there are no trails and no signs we are not sure if we made it to the top of Star Dune or not. We more than likely made it up to High Dune which is 699 feet tall, but I cannot be sure.The trek down was much easier than going up, but the issue was now the wind. It was in your face and you could feel your exposed skin being pelted with grains of sand. Now I know what sand blasting feels like on a minimal level.Total hike time was about 1 hour and 40 minutes. My suggestion would be to make sure that you have eye covering and possibly a light scarf to wrap around your face to cover your exposed skin. I had sand in my teeth and ears and even with sunglasses I had grains of sand in my eyes that I had to flush out when I got home and took a shower. If you wear contact lenses you may want to take them out.This was a great way to end our National Parks tour.","October 13, 2018",Prepare to be sand blasted,109,"Denver, Colorado",4

The park is free and I highly recommend renting a sand sled from the Oasis for $20. It is a 5-10 minute walk before you reach the first dune. Being September, there was no water to cross like I have seen in Spring and Summer photos. I am a 58 year old female with a slight heart problem and I had no problem walking through the sand and climbing the smaller dunes and sledding down. Seeing the Dunes up close is just magnificent!

What your going to want to be aware of:- The sand can be very very hot to walk on, if your going for an extended walk if any period of time your going to want to skip the flip flops and possibly even sandals. Bring a or easily vented sandals. - Bring a lot if water if your going to climb/walk/hike up them. It's a easy walk but the sand gets in your nose/throat and makes it hard to breathe. In addition to this: it's Hot!- Make sure to pack a lunch. There is no food establishments very close to the Dunes, there are plenty of Picnic Tables but bring a snack. - Make sure to keep an eye on your gas. Once you get close rest stops and gas stations get a little rare. - Bring a camera! The Dunes are super photogenic and so is your Spouse/GF/BF/Child/Family! - Don't attempt to climb the Hills if it's raining/threatening to rain.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This was amazing! I wish we would have more time than one day there. We stayed at the Lodge; I feel that completed the experience. Here are some tips from our time there and from what I saw. 1. Rent the sand sleds and/or sand boards. We saw people bring snow sleds of all kinds and none of them worked. It is worth the cost. The only thing I saw remotely work was cardboard. It's worth the money.2. Wear thick socks. We wore holes in our socks just from the 1/2 mile walk to and from the parking lot. Whenever we go back, I will wear flip flops to and from the walk and put socks on once we start playing in the dunes.3. Even if the air temperature is not that hot, the sand more than likely will be. 4. Bring plenty of water. Seriously, fill a backpack full of bottled water, extra socks and sunblock and you will be good to go!","September 1, 2018",Will go back!,59,"Wichita, Kansas",5

In addition to hiking out on the Dunes one morning (and, yes, if you plan to go out on the Dunes, the best time is early AM before the sand starts to ‘cook’), we also took our two dogs on several wonderful hikes on other occasions on trails that wend their way up into the forested hillsides east of the Dunes, affording great views, smells, different varieties of plants, trees, cacti, and all kinds of wildlife. There are opportunities for ‘Back Country’ hiking and Camping, plus a variety of activities led by Park Rangers.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"There’s a local saying that you’ll find Colorado about 100 miles out of Denver. Some truth to that and then some. This corner of CO in the San Luis Valley is part of the real CO as part of what was Spanish or Mexican territory from 1541 to 1851. If you have the time, I’d recommend camping at Piñon Flats. You can actually camp on the dunes, but it can be very weather dependent. It’s amazing at night, but if there is rain and lightening, you are pretty exposed. My recommendation is to camp in the trees and if the weather allows, walk out near sunset and star gaze. Then use headlamps to get back to your campsite. There is no water on the Dunes. If the weather is good, I would not discourage a backpack on the Dunes, but know your rain and wind forecast!!For day trips, start early and get to High Dune! It’s a great view!! I do recommend hiking poles for stability. And it’s hard hiking. You are walking on sand!And yes, sand goes everywhere! Everywhere! Cameras and phones should be protected! And if you sit in the sand, the sand gets into other areas too. However, it’s just way too much fun not too!Sand-boarding or sand sledding is a real joy. But remember that sand rash in a spill is not the same as snow!! The weekends are busy in summer and mellow on weekdays! But even on a Saturday, the lines move pretty fast. 15 minutes at the entrance station!There is a general store near the park entrance. If you have strict dietary needs, bring your food and beverages with you!!And lastly. If you have time, take your water sandals and get to Zapata Falls. The road is rough (and just outside the park) but worth seeing the water in the midst of the desert. The falls are way back in. Mind the weather for a downpour!

Keep in mind that there is a lot of walking and hiking and it is not always easy. Always take plenty of water and some snacks too. Try to travel light. Have good walking shoes that you don't mind getting sandy. There are plenty of informational signs on the way in, but once you are on the dunes, you are on your own, so keep track of where you are.

There is only one paved road in the park and that road ends soon after you have passed the park boundary. First you come to the Visitor Center. A little further the road splits, at one end you will find a picnic area and a parking lot on the edge of the dunes, while the Pinyon Flats campsite and an amphitheater are located at the other end.

They have signs posted to drink water and that the sand is hot but that’s it. It would be helpful if they sold water bottles and socks at the entrance or visitors center for those that drove thirty miles from the last town to visit the dunes. It would also be helpful if the park employees told visitors, upon entry of the extreme wind, heat, long walk to the dunes and dangers of the activity. I saw grown men who looked physically fit, struggle to walk up the dunes after a surf down. When I asked an employee about safety, he said many have been injured this summer ranging from heat stroke to contact burns on their feet to a broken neck. An ambulance takes an hour to get there; no first-aid is available on site. Flight for life has made several visits recently to fly critically injured sand surfers to the hospital. If we could do it over, we would wait until after 4:00 p.m. when the sun was not so hot and the sand cooled down from the daytime temperature of 110 degrees.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We visited Great Sand Dunes NP in late June 2018. Due to wildfires, we had to take a detour to get there. The kids enjoyed the visitor center and earning their junior ranger badge. We rented a sand sled & sand board to use on the dunes. It was very windy up on the dunes. I have a very strange suggestion: if you are prone to ear issues, I would take ear plugs. Our 9 year old son had a hole in his ear drum and while sand sledding he wiped out, whacked his ear incredibly hard against the sand, so hard that sand went down his ear canal, through the hole in his ear drum and filled up his middle ear. He is now recovering from surgery to flush out the middle ear and patch the hole in the ear drum. I greatly regret not taking along his ear plugs that day ): On a positive note, the sand dunes are really neat to see and a once in a lifetime opportunity to play on that much sand!

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Everyone says to arrive early since the sand gets very hot. My wife and I didn't do that good but we got there around 10:30 A.M. There were already many people on the dunes and I mean high up so they had been here awhile. This also meant most parking spaces at the dunes parking area were taken. I had read about water in Medano Creek and having to cross the creek to get to the dunes. When we visited in late July there was no water at all in the creek. It is a long walk across the sand from the parking lot until you reach the first dunes. You can do as much or as little as your abilities allow. There are many ways to have fun - walking, climbing the dunes, sandboarding down the dunes or just sitting on a dune watching everyone else. Be sure to bring plenty of water and have on sunblock. We stayed in the dune field until around 1:00 P.M. It was getting hotter by then. I think we were very fortunate as we had a cooler day and there was a nice breeze blowing. There are restrooms and water by the dunes parking lot. Just back from the parking lot is a nice picnic area.After being on the dunes we visited the visitor center. Here also are restrooms and water. There are exhibits (several hands-on) and a twenty minute movie that is shown every half hour. A portion of the visitor center has many publications, souvenirs and clothing items for sale. We also hiked the Montville Nature Trail but did not find it very impressive. There is another whole section to the park which is the National Preserve that includes the high country of the Sangre De Cristo Mountains. Nearly all of this is backcountry which we did not visit.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"There is enough to do at this National Park that you might plan to spend the day, however, after you have climbed to the top of the highest dune, which could take you 4 hours, and then descended, you will not have the energy to walk the nature trail or see the other attractions at the park. Be sure to carry in lots of water, as there is none available on the dunes, and with the dry atmosphere at 8,000 feet altitude, and the windy conditions, you will need to hydrate often. Sunscreen, hats, sunglasses and your camera are must-take items, as well as a backpack to carry it all. The climb to the top is worth the effort, because from there you can see the expansiveness of the dunes to the west and the mountains beyond. If you bring little children, don't expect to make it to the top and please don't force them to try, but athletic children older than 10 should be able to make the climb. Wear shoes, not sandals.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"I led a group of 6th & 7th grade students on a fantastic trip to explore the Sand Dunes for 1 1/2 days in late February. I'd heard about the area for so long that I just had to experience it for myself. Know that the Lodge at the entrance doesn't open until late March, so you need to stay in Alamosa or other nearby town (Alamosa is closest/easiest). There are plenty of hotel options. In the warm months, I'd be leery of the campsites- we saw the ones at the park and they look great, but I've read multiple stories about camping there and having very strong winds that blow tents around, etc. For the first afternoon, we rented sand sleds from Kristy Sports in Alamosa. The drive over to the park is about 45 minutes, including a fairly long stretch once you get off the main road. The visitor's center was still open so we stopped there first to get oriented. The rangers and volunteers are very helpful. The dunes lot is just a couple of minutes from the visitors center- the park is well marked with signage and the maps are useful. The kids had a lot of fun sledding. There's so much area to explore and climb! It did get pretty cold since it was getting toward sunset. Always make sure you have the right gear! It is a long walk getting back though sand in windy cold. The next day we started back out in the visitor's center. The volunteer was so incredibly helpful and we sketched out a plan for hiking and afternoon activities at the center. She was amazing in leading our students through looking at artifacts and explanations about the geography/geology/people of the greater area. I learned a ton and we were even able to hold a mammoth tooth! After these activities and the students being sworn in as junior rangers, we ate our packed lunches and headed out on our hike. The trails were pretty well marked, but I recommend referring to your map to make sure you're understanding what loops you're meeting up with, etc. Pretty hikes through a good variety of terrain with forest going along stream and open hillside with gorgeous views of the dunes. After about 2 hours of hiking we got back to the visitor's center to grab our bus and got back to the dunes. It was even tougher to sled than the day before because of wind, but we were determined to summit the dune ridge in front of us. After battling it out, we were rewarded with amazing views and a sense of accomplishment. But it was also what the other teacher and I suspected- the first dune ridge is only one of many and you would truly need to do the full hike up the largest dune (something like 6 hours round trip?) to get a full up top view. We trekked back out and left in time to head to the Alamosa Wildlife Refuge (gorgeous in it's own right- the winter sunset was beautiful against the mountains- I wrote a while separate review about it). I would love to visit in the late May/early June time to experience the creek, but glad we didn't attempt it this year with the lack of snowfall. I was told that the creek wasn't running at all this year around the Memorial Day weekend.

I believe it cost $20 to get into but if you buy a National Park pass for $80 you can get into all the national parks in the US. Walking up the dunes is a lot of work but the reward is sliding down the sand dunes at top speed. If you are new to this type of fun, I would suggest getting a sled instead of a surf board. I could really see someone breaking their neck with the surf board. I fell off a few times and let me tell you I was in pain. With the sled you are closer to the ground. My teenage daughter was not allowed to surf. We rented our sand boards from Kristie Mountain Sports which was 3 minute drive from the Super 8 we stayed at.

Heed the warnings to wear socks, as they protect your feet when sand does get in your shoes. Bring a LOT of water. We got boards at the Oasis and the folks from our group had fun when they made it to the smaller dunes. The estimated trek to the bigger dunes is 2 and 1/2 hours. So you walk 2 1/2 hours to go down the dune. It is an arduous journey. My youngest and I went into the Visitor Center, they have great visiuals to explain the formation of the dunes.

Its a rigerous hike because you are climbing sand dunes. Remember to wear socks because the sand gets hot.","July 19, 2018",Amazing!!,32,"Wilmington, Delaware",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,Sand sledding and boarding was lots of fun. Beware the sand gets extremely hot on your feet. Wear socks. It's not pretty but neither on blistered feet. There's almost always a breeze blowing so it doesn't feel bad temp wise until walking up hill in the sand. For those of us coming in from other states the altitude is an adjustment. You need to rent the sleds and snow boards before going into the dunes. Once you get there it's a hike between the parking lot and the first dune. It doesn't look like much but it is. Lunch at the oasis was nice and the food was good. We then went to the waterfall. It's a 3 mile drive up a VERY bumpy road. You are not going to want to go fast on here unless your vehicle is made for 4 wheeling. It's rough. Once you park it's a .5 mile hike and totally worth it. Once you reach the trees it's like stepping into air conditioning. The water is so cold and the fall is pretty. Wear some shoes you don't mind getting wet as you have to walk through the creek to get there. I didn't do the 6 mile hike so I can't comment on that. I took my kids ages 13 and 25 we had a ton of fun so go see this incredible place you won't regret it.,"July 13, 2018",Fun fun fun,9,,5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We enjoyed our short visit here. We went on a two-hour ranger-led evening hike that was an excellent introduction to the dunes.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Went to the Dunes for probably the tenth time. This was the first time that an extraordinarily dry year has occurred. Medano Creek was dry, all the way to the state park. However, the Dunes retain their incredible mystery, and the forested trails for hiking are a good respite for the incredibly hot temperatures. It was a first time trip for my partner, and she was taken aback by the sheer magnitude of the dunes from so far away.","July 10, 2018","Dry year, but still fun",34,"Denver, Colorado",5

The dunes are huge and beautiful and change all of the time according to the docent we spoke to. There is also a huge recreation area on the west side of the dunes, which we did not make it to. It is truly an awe-inspiring place to visit, but is all sand, so the walking and climing is challenging.

I also recommend getting an early start if you intend to spend much time on the sand. Colorado is sunny and the sand is reflective. Lots of sunscreen and reapply frequently. Make sure to hydrate before, during and after.Finally, in the summer, the sand gets very hot.

If u walk barefoot to get to the dunes, carry your shoes because it gets hot on the way back. It’s a good walk from the parking lot to the dunes so be prepared if small children.

Be ready for it though, take your time if not in shape. If you are, try to push to not stop. Great view from the top and an experience. Did not rent boards to go down although I wanted to. But afterwards glad I didn't because for every run you go down, you have to remember, you have to walk up. Close to the lots there are small hills for kids, so easy to go up and down.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"The Sangre de Cristo Mountains are beautiful, as you get closer to the Park you can see the Great Sand Dunes rising out of the valley floor against the mountain backdrop. The Great Sand Dunes Wilderness Area, established in 1976 and is an amazing feat of nature. The first time one sees these giant desert dunes piled up against the Sangre de Cristo mountains—the experience can be inspiring and a bit unsettling. The combination doesn't seem to make sense. Yet it is that very combination of high mountains, desert, and water that makes the creation of the tallest dunes in North America possible. To climb to the top of the dunes is an elevation gain of 699 feet, and 2.5 miles round trip walking in soft sand-with every step we slid back a half-step . Star Dune, the tallest dune in North America at 755 feet with a dunefield covering 30 square miles. We explored the dunefield from the main Dunes Parking Area, distances can be deceptive here, although it does not look far, it really is (bring water, lots of water). Medano Creek had absolutely no flow (due to the drought) as we walked to the bottom of the first dunes. We sat in the sand and watched sandboarders slide down the dunes for a while. The sand can reach temperatures of 150oF on a hot summer's day, so visiting in the early morning is advisable. We trekked back to the parking lot to drive over to the visitors center which has a nice gift shop and fascinating information on how exactly these sand dunes formed here. This was an add on to our trip and we are glad we made the extra stop.","July 4, 2018",Stunning to See the Dunes!,73,"Kissimmee, Florida",4

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We were recently traveling toward Mesa Verde National Park and saw a sign pointingto Great Sand Dunes which were just 20 miles out of our way. So, we took a detour and added this little visited national park to our itinerary. We are definitely glad we did.The scale of the dunes are mind boggling, reaching 1500 feet high at points, with another 2000 feet of sand underneath. All of it traveled from New Mexico and Arizona carried by prevailing winds, and was deposited at the foot of the mountains by mother nature.The visitor's center did a nice job of explaining the competing natural forces that caused the dunes to be deposited there. And, they did an even better job in explainingwhy the dunes stayed over time, rather than being eroded by wind and weather.We did not venture out onto the dunes themselves, but plenty of people did take the strenuous trek to the top. We watched a number of kids roll the entire way down.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We have never been and added it to our summer road trip itinerary without too many expectations. We stayed in Alamosa next to Kristi MountainSports where we rented a sand sled and sand board. They were awesome and the equipment seemed to be well maintained. We headed to the dunes a little later in the morning than we had planned and arrived around 11. In June I would highly recommend getting there a few hours earlier than we did as the sands had already heated enough to be near unbearable on bare feet. Luckily we headed the advice of others and brought socks and wore them while walking up the dunes. We stayed on the lower dunes and had plenty of runs to choose from. I would have loved to make it to the top but that just wasn’t happening with the heat. Colorado is experiencing a very dry summer after a winter of minimum snow fall so the river shown in the brochures was non existent. Also, for flatlander like us, walking uphill in deep sand above 7000 feet was a little taxing. The number of other trails in the park is often over looked and I wish we had planned more time to take a hike into the mountains of the park. The restaurant just outside the park was decent food at a decent price. The pies are made on site and are awesome! This is also a place to rent sleds, but they seemed a little more worn than the ones we picked up in AlamosaGreat place to spend a day and experience a natural wonder.

There are several hiking trails in the park. We did the high dune which is very difficult. Hiking in sand is no easy task. Try staying on the ridges of the dunes because the sand is more packed in those areas---easier to walk. The Dunes are quite steep in many areas, so be prepared for a workout. Best time is early morning before the sand gets hot. We also hiked the Dune's Overlook---gives a different perspective of the dunes from upland forested area.

The sites are smallish, but loop 3 has the bigger sites. Definitely look at sites along the south side facing the dunes.A few other things we learned: come during a new moon. The stars are amazing, and it helps with no moon. There is a couple great hikes, like the one to the falls. Lastly, be sure to find time to see the visitor center, it was really cool and the staff is great.The best time of year is early may when the river is still running.

When you see the dunes from the visitor center and parking lot, they look large, but you don't really get to see the dunes until you begin walking the dunes.From other reviews that I've read, we were fortunate that we went when it was overcast outside, so the sand was not hot at all. However, we did have a 40 mph cross wind which was blowing sand across the hills of sand. We could feel the sand hit us, however it didn't hurt. As you walk up the first dune, we began to realize how enormous these dunes are. My teenage boys had no problem trekking up the hills, I resorted to pacing myself: Take 50 steps, rest for 45 seconds, until to the top of the dune. We walked several dunes, enjoying views of clouds surrounding mountains off in the distance, as well as other dunes and vegetation off in the distance. While I limited my exertion to only going up and down the dunes when necessary, my sons seemed to enjoy running up and down the dunes, making sand angels, and log rolling down the hills (needless to say we all needed showers when we were done with the adventure.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We traveled to Colorado for a wedding and made a 3 and 1/2 hour trip out of the way to see the sand dunes. We stayed in Monte Vista (an hour outside of the dunes) and questioned our decision the whole way. The drive from Aspen to Monte Vista is pretty uneventful (apart from Independence Pass) and pretty boring as most of it looks like desert. We ultimately arrived at the dunes around 6:15pm (in May) so the sun was just beginning to set. By that time the sand had cooled a good bit and we were able to walk barefoot when our shoes became too bogged down by the sand. We also were able to avoid the heat of the day (and presumably the crowds - though it was also a Tuesday).It took us flatlanders (from New Orleans) almost two hours to climb halfway to High Dune. The altitude, the steepness of the dunes, and the softness of the sand made it a pretty strenuous hike for us. However, the views really make the trip worth it. Highly. Highly recommend.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Massive formation of sand dunes at the foot of the front range of the Rockies on the East side of the San Luis Valley. Seriously, there is SO much sand here! We have been here three times now. Once over Medano Pass (4x4 trail) into the back side of the dunes, and the other times in a 2wd vehicle from the front main access. If you like moderate 4x4 trails, I suggest the Medano Pass way in! It is beautiful and where you come in, there is close access to the dunes just across the creek (if it is flowing). The sand is loose on the road until you get to the 2wd area, so maintain momentum or air down a bit. (there is a free air compressor site in the park on the main road to air back up). From the main road, you come past the Visitor Center - and you should stop. Not just for the clean restrooms and gift shop. The displays show the fascinating reasons why these dunes have formed and why the majority of them have stopped growing now. Good stuff! On down the road, you turn to the left for the main access to the dunes. For a portion of the year, there is a creek flowing... we came in June this time, and were told it dried up in mid-May. Getting to the dunes is a long walk across hot, loose sand. Then, if you want to climb, it is more loose sand. (GREAT way to wear out the kids! - They can't escape, you can see them from a long distance). Be sure to wear sandals of some sort. As mentioned, the sand is HOT... [ProTip: If your feet start burning, just burrow down a few inches where the radiant heat has not reached and cool them off... ankles will still burn a bit, but you will get some relief] Tennis shoes do collect this sand and distribute it toward your toe, where it will safely reside until you remove the shoe. Also, a hat and sunscreen would be a good idea! They sell some great sun hats at the Visitor Center for a reasonable price. Also, bring water to drink. It is always a good idea to have water with you. If you want to ""surf"" the dunes, make sure you stop at The Oasis to rent a board BEFORE entering the park. It makes for a sad family if you discover the rentals are only available outside the park and you are already at the dunes and covered in sand. There are nice restrooms with running water and a rinse station near the parking lot and a lot of picnic tables for day use.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Located about 30 miles outside the town of Alamosa in Colorado, the Great Sand Dunes are a fascinating feature that has been created by nature over thousands of years. The giant sand dunes sitting at the base of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains highlight the diversity of habitats in southwestern Colorado, which ranges from wetlands, prairies, mountains, and forests. The sand dunes seem oddly out of place, it is almost as if a piece of the Middle East was scooped up and dropped in the mountain valley. The reality is that they were created after a large lake dried up thousands of years ago and the wind drove the sand to the base of the mountains.Although this year the mountains did not receive a lot of snow and therefore the runoff was minimal, usually there is a river or stream running at the base of the sand dunes, making the contrast even more interesting. One of the good things about the stream not being there was that we didn’t have to get our feet wet in order to get to the base of the dunes, but the bad part was that it was even more sand to walk through in the heat of the sun. It is not easy walking in the sand and even harder walking up the steep sides of the dunes. They may not seem as large from the distance, but the actual peaks of the dunes can be as high as 750 feet (230 meters).As more and more people visit the dunes, one of the most popular things to do is to bring a sandboard and go sandboarding. People will spend hours climbing to the top and then boarding their way back down. Just to reach the top is difficult, so to do it over and over again in order to shred the sand is a real achievement. It also means that you will be surrounded by plenty of crowds as people flock to the area. There is camping nearby and you will find and endless array of motorhomes and RV’s. Since it is a national park, you can expect to pay $20 per vehicle to get into the park, which is good for seven days.It took us about three hours to drive from Colorado Springs to the Great Sand Dunes, but it is well worth the drive. We hadn’t been to the sand dunes for over twenty years, so it was also a little bit nostalgic for us as we remembered bringing our young children there to play in the sand. We only spent a couple of hours at the sand dunes as climbing the hills is very exhausting and hard on the legs. Even though we were walking in the Sahara Desert only a few weeks ago, visiting this unique place in Colorado was really something special.","June 5, 2018",Wonderful National Park to Visit,40,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We left early from Pagosa Springs to get here early. It was almost a two hour drive getting us there around 10:00 A.M. You have to take route 150 which is off of 160 if your coming from the west or south. I am not sure what the delay was when we got there. The traffic was backed up for a half a mile. The only thing I could think of was parking space was limited. We had waited almost a half an hour and decided to leave because when had other stops in our plans. I can only suggest getting there real early because we were here in May. With schools be let out, the wait could be longer. Suggest calling the Park Service to see if in fact you can expect delays in getting in.It wasn't a total loss but still disappointing in not being able to get in immediately.","June 3, 2018",Seen from a Distance,190,"Fredericksburg, Virginia",3
Great Sand Dunes National Park,We rented two boards at the Oasis on the way into the park. The four kids shared. They will be wore out after walking back up so sharing gives them time to rest. Walking in the sand is no joke! I saw people up high but most go to the first available slope as it is exhausting just getting there. You can easily spend 2-3 hours there. My kids were done sledding at the 2 hour point. The wind was very strong and our eyes were starting to burn. If we had more time- I would have liked to walk up to the falls. It’s on the road outside the park gate. ,"May 30, 2018",Fun place ,11,"Jefferson City, Missouri",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,We were there in May. Sand was warm but not hot. They say it gets to 150 degrees. Tried to sled down the dunes but out saucer just stuck. Only with a lot of effort by someone pushing did we get anywhere. It was very windy so the blowing sand a bit annoying. Its a walk to the dunes most places. only 10% of snow fall this year they told us so the creek was low. We did have great horseback rides through the dunes.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"If you've ever walked on the sand at the beach, think about doing in on a mountain. Climbing the sand dunes is a difficult and wonderful experience as you sink into the mountains of sand. It's a beautiful site. Be sure to have allowed yourself to acclimate to the elevation or you'll really be out of breath as you climb. The Visitor Center is really nice too!","May 29, 2018",An amazing place!,64,,5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"The Sand Dunes and Zapata Falls have been an annual trip for our family for going on 20 years. This was the first time we camped inside the park. High winds in the afternoon make it almost impossible to set up camp. We stayed in space 29. It has a beautiful view. Our party was made up of 5 adults and a large dog. Site was large enough for 2-4 man tents and a 4X4 mental dog kennel. It got really cold overnight so be sure to bring proper gear. Campfires where allowed in the campground during the time we went, however there was a fire ban in the county. We were unable to purchase wood outside the park, the little store near the campground had plenty of wood and just about anything you may have forgot or didnt know you wanted.The store has limited hours was open 9am-1pm and 4pm-7pm. Nothing is permitted to hang from trees, so if you plan to bring hammocks be sure to pick yourself up a hammock stand. We fit 4 hammock stands comfortable around the firepit. Another successful family camping trip to the Sand Dunes and Zapata Falls in the books. We would definitely stay again, but would choose a site on the higher side of the loop where there was less wind. Hope you find this information helpful.","May 29, 2018",Annual Family Trip,0,,5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We went right near the end of December as part of a longer family road trip. I'd been there two other times but things have changed a lot in the last 15 years or so...although the sand dunes themselves are still spectacular. This place is a must-see if you're in southern CO or northern NM.One thing to note: the creek you have to cross on foot was partially frozen over, but in many places lots of people broke through and got their feet wet. Probably not a big deal in most cases, but it's worth bringing a change of socks and shoes, especially if you want to avoid cold feet in the winter (or blisters in the summer).","May 25, 2018","Wonderful Park, Even in December",114,"San Ramon, Costa Rica",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Nice park in the middle of nowhere. A lot of it is accessible only with a four-wheel drive vehicle, and even with that you'll have to do some tire deflating to deal with sand. But the part of the park that's accessible with your rented whatever has a couple of day's worth of interesting things to see.The dunes, of course, are quite spectacular - they're huge. The climb to the top of High Dune (not quite the tallest, but the most visible peak) is a lung-buster, given the park's elevation (all 8000' plus). But the view from the top is worth every heart-pounding minute of the climb. Do it early in the day if at all possible - the heat on a summer afternoon is probably downright dangerous.But hikers shouldn't pass up the Mosca Pass trail. The park brochure doesn't say much about it, but it's a delight. Starting near the visitor's center, it parallels Mosca Creek up to the Mosca Pass, at 9750'. The lower part of the trail is tree-lined, moderately rocky, and steep-ish (but never extreme). The surprise occurs on the upper half, where the trail actual becomes more gentle, wandering through high meadows. Just delightful. On the walk down, you keep getting views of the dunes beyond the bottom of the narrow valley you're hiking in. The Park Service calls it a 6-hour roundtrip, but I took less than five, and while I'm in decent shape, I'm over 65, and live at 1200', nothing like this place!","May 25, 2018",Don't miss the Mosca Pass,75,Connecticut,4
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"My extended family: daughter and grandchildren, ages 7,5, and 2, with my son's family with 3 children, ages 6,6, and 3. We all had a lot of fun hiking up and bounding down the dunes. We all collected sand in our shoes, but so what? (We left it behind.) We thought about renting the sand sleds but after enjoying the afternoon without them, decided that was enough fun on the sand, and instead chose to hike several short hikes in the Park the following day.","May 24, 2018",Not too hot the end of April and Great family vacation,41,"Peachtree City, Georgia",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We drove past the primary lot, beyond where the pavement ends, parking in the very small lot known as the Point of No Return. We trekked north to the dunes and across Medano Creek, a trickle when we visited, ascending the first ridge we could fine. We spent the next four hours ascending ridges and sandboarding down any and every face. We rented boards from the Oasis, just outside the gates, strapping them to our packs to carry. While not as graceful as a snowboard, sandboarding is a blast and that front edge slows you down instead of flipping you forward. Our trek up the north eastern side of the dunes kept the Santa de Cristo Mountains in full view while providing the sharp unique contrast of the dunes at all times in near total isolation, a sharp contrast from the primary dune hike filled with hundreds of hikers. We hiked in water shoes and barefoot, the latter being difficult on both toes but necessary for sandboarding. If I had to do it again I might try running shoes with a nice wide sole to help float above the sand. Bring water and start early as the wind picked up around noon sending grains of sands gracefully but painfully across the highest ridges.","May 21, 2018",Beyond the point of no return,15,"Denver, Colorado",5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"The Great Sand Dunes National Park is one magnificent place. I have visited the Great Sand Dunes with my family twice, and both times, we enjoyed the park immensely. From afar, the Great Sand Dunes look so insignificant as the majestic mountains (some 14ers) tower around it. However, as we start to approach the entrace to the park, the Great Sand Dunes becomes this mind-blowing, seemingly-impossible nature art! To me, this is one of those places I just could not get enough photographs of.Medano Creek's flow peak season is end of May to beginning June. If you are trying to catch the flowing Medano Creek, I highly suggest checking the water condition at the Great Sand Dunes NPS (.gov) website. They provide a forecast flow, and they consistently update the current condition of the creek.Our first visit was a day trip. We were able to experience a little bit of the surging water, and a little bit of the warm sand on our toes. We got there late-morning, and we had to find parking parallel to the road. It seems like there was a huge crowd, but the Great Sand Dunes is so vast, there were times when we felt we were the only ones there. The Medano creek did not dissapoint! So much fun!During our second trip, we camped out for a night at the Piñon Flats Campground within the park. I did not make reservations, so we got there super early and tested our luck. That is NOT advisable, as the campgrounds are always full during the peak season. We, however, lucked out. We enjoyed our night stay, and we were visited by a deer the next morning :)******My quick tips:During peak season, get there early. I would also advise to bring a pop-up shelter as there aren't really shady places around. Bring sun protection (hats, sunscreen...etc), and bring sand toys for the kids (if you have kids). There are plenty of areas -- like along the banks of the creek -- where the water gently flows. Medano Creek has frequent water surges, which are fun! Some areas on the lower part of the sand dunes (across the creek) would require some sort of footwear (there are larger debris mixed with the sand, and the sand in some areas can gets REALLY HOT) -- open toe *may* be a good idea; otherwise, the hot sand can get stuck in the toe end, and you may have to just take the shoes off occasionally to dump the collected sand/debris out. The sand is smoother and cooler as you proceed up the dunes. Try climbing the steeper parts of the dunes without shoes. Climbing some of the most FUN parts of the dunes require a little patience -- and all extremities -- as it is 2 steps forward, one step back. It would be wise to plan for this, so that your arms are free of items, and no giant DSLR camera is hanging off of your neck...like my first visit, lol!! These steep areas can be a real challenge for small kids (our 3 y/o monkey couldn't do it on his own, as he was slipping down the sand more than he was able to move up), so my husband and I took turns -- with one propelling him up, and the other catching and pulling him up (my son did not enjoy that part...lol!) What we did not experience, but caught a glimpse of: primitive roads. It looks like it would be a lot of fun, but high-clearance 4x4 is necessary. We walked part of it, as our campsite was perched parallel to it, and the long road gives a different view of the sand dunes from a different prespective.Weird experience: My cheezy phone camera refused to take panoramic shots when we were up higher on the Sand Dunes. I am uncertain as to why exactly, but it happened both times we visited, and only when we got to a certain higher elevation on the dunes.Learning about the Great Sand Dunes is most definitely interesting! Crossing or walking the surging Medano Creek is exciting! Climbing the amazing dunes was exhilarating! The views all around are amazing! The Great Sand Dunes is easily one of our favorite National Parks (that we have been to), as it combines different elements in one vast, beautiful, tranquil space.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"I have passed near Sand Dunes National Park several times while traversing Colorado, from Denver to Cortez, and had never been able to visit. This trip, I made it a priority!Being from Western Michigan, I have had the good fortune to experience sand dunes and the way the wind and weather shape the dunes all of my life. Experiencing the dune ecosystem at Great Sand Dunes National Park was uniquely different. I spoke with the Visitor Center staff and when I mentioned I was from Michigan, I was immediately informed that their ""dunes were bigger than mine!"" (They were comparing Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore to Great Sand Dunes National Park.) I watched the park video about the Great Sand Dunes NP and learned about the annual cycle that the dunes go through throughout the year. I was impressed that the dunes continue to replenish itself, with the help of prevailing winds from the South West and the mountains bordering the park on the North and East side of the park. For those who enjoy playing on the dunes, there were ample opportunities for that. Some visitors had rented ""Sand Boards"" or ""Dune Sleds"" that they rode down after climbing up the dunes. The tallest dune is 750 feet tall, with the dune field measuring 30 miles across, with the rest of the ecosystem added, it is significantly larger. There are trails for hiking, two tracks for off road vehicles, campgrounds and more. Other resources are limited, but there are several small towns in the area.All in all, it was a good trip, one that was enjoyed in the spring time when crowds were smaller than during the summer season.","April 16, 2018",Dunes With A View,26,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",4

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"If you go to National Parks, then you already appreciate their beauty, the reason for their protection, and the various ecosystems in place that created and/or support it.The ecosystem that sustains the sand dunes is fascinating. We help our kids with the Junior Ranger program, so we learn a lot that way. Be sure to watch the video in the Visitor Center at a minimum to appreciate what you’re going to explore in the park.Consider the weather before going! Avoid stormy days where high winds and lightning is possible. Also, avoid hot temps in the summer when the sand can burn exposed feet and skin.We rented sand sleds at Kristi Sports in Alamosa, which were a blast. Know that it’s about a 1/2 mile hike from the parking lot to the first actual dunes: you hike across a flat sandy wash to get there. So plan accordingly if you plan on hiking, where you don’t want to haul a sled around. We hiked to a high dune, then I ran back to the car to get the sleds to avoid doubling our efforts for the whole family.In April, Medno Creek isn’t flowing strongly yet, and the weather was too cold for getting wet anyway. But it’s like a beach in the summer! A very unique recreation area in a National Park. We didn’t get to explore at night, but they say the star watching is awesome out on the dunes. Also the Ord’s Kangaroo Rat is nocturnal, so that’s the only way to see a live one. There is real, taxidermic one on display in the Visitor Center. Bring a Camelbak, water and food, sunscreen, sunglasses and a windbreaker to protect against wind and blowing sand. And your camera of course. Just don’t get sand in it. Shoes and socks are your best bet for hiking and sledding—just know you’ll get sand in them eventually! Pants are good too, just don’t wear cargo pants if you plan on sledding or sand boarding—pockets will accumulate sand for days.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"The most important thing about the Great Sand Dunes is to do some research before you go so you know what you will have when you get there. We wanted water so we went within the first part of June (around the 9th) when Medano creek is at its peak. We also made sure to arrive on a Wednesday because the reserved camping spots were taken and we knew there weren't too many. However we were able to arrive before 10 and secured a fabulous spot with a great view of the dunes especially during the full moon. We spent 3 days lying in the sun by the creek which is much less crowded where the campsites are than by the visitor's center, playing with skim boards in the creek, sand sledding, exploring the visitor's center, hiking the dunes, and visiting nearby Zapata falls. The water from Medano creek is cold and refreshing and the sand underneath is very smooth so it feels very nice to walk on. We also hiked the dunes at night and had the experience of crossing the creek barefoot in 40 degree temperatures. Here are a few things to know before you go: We left on Saturday and by 10 Am there was a line of cars more than a half a mile long. The sand is very hot in the summer. You need to wear closed toed shoes. It is a bit of a walk from the campground down to the creek and even further to cross the creek onto the dunes. Hiking the dunes during the day is strenuous and difficult because of the heat and sand. Take plenty of water and cover up! Hiking the dunes at night is cold and the sand often blows. We did both and both times my husband and one 11 year old son made it and my other 11 year old son and I did not.

We had an afternoon/evening and then the next morning to spend at Great Sand Dunes and I wish we had longer. The first afternoon/evening we visited the visitor center, walked up to the dunes to take photos and then hiked the Dunes Overlook trail from Pinon Flats campground. We had the Dunes Overlook trail to ourselves perhaps because a storm was coming in. Great views of the Dunes particularly dramatic with storm. The campground at the base of this trail has great views of the Dunes and next time we would definitely camp here!The next day we came back to rent sand sleds from the gas station/convenience store right before the park entrance. We hiked up to High Dune, the second highest dune in the park with our sand sleds. We had great views but you are definitely exposed so bring plenty of water, wear a hat and use lots of sunscreen! You have to pick your own route and hiking in sand is hard work! We sledded our way down which was a lot of fun although I got sand everywhere! You have to use plenty of wax and I stuck my hands in the sand to control my speed, direction and just stay atop of the board.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We have thought about going to this national park for years and never have because it was just too far out of the way and we didn't want to devote a whole trip to it. This year we bit the bullet and devoted a long weekend to the trip. We don't regret it for a second. This park is breathtaking. The sheer size of the dunes really cannot be described or even represented in pictures. No matter how big you think they will be, they are bigger. We went in February and were a little concerned that it might be too cold, but we lucked out. It was in the 50s and the sand was warm enough that folks were going barefoot. My 5 year old took a nap on one of the dunes! The majesty this gem of nature presents really fills your heart to the brim.

In the spring and summer, there is a wide river/steam running in front of the dunes which is shallow and provides the kids so extra fun. Sand can get hot so wear proper footwear but it's worth the climb up to see the views. Get a sandboard and ""surf"" down the dunes. You can camp on the dunes, in the area opposite them or just outside them but call ahead during peak times to get a spot. Really worth going a little out of your way to see this unique natural wonder.","January 12, 2018",A masterpiece of nature,36,"Evergreen, Colorado",5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,January is a great time to visit the dunes.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"If you plan to camp, you should make a reservation; however, the Park usually has sites available. There are fire ants, so you need to pay attention where you walk. You can camp on the dunes, but you need to check with the ranger for permits and general information. A shop outside the Park has skid boards. You should wear boots on the dunes because the sand gets very hot. There are a lot of hiking trails and the views are spectacular. There is camping available outside the park as well just minutes outside of the park's entrance.","January 3, 2018",Amazing place,27,"Park Ridge, Illinois",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,My wife and I were just traveling through and stopped for a visit in and around the visitors center.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Initially I was not sure I was going to like Great Sand Dunes National Park. To me it didn't look like there was going to be enough to do. However after I went there I was very happy that I chose to go there anyway. It was an experience I have never had before and I enjoyed it very much, as it is a very unique place. One of the things you have to do is to climb up the dunes. Some of them can be pretty steep but still do-able and since there are no restrictions you can go anywhere you want. When I climbed the dunes I got a ways up and started to think that I was nuts for doing this, but eventually I got past that after seeing the view. Thinking of how all that sand got there and how long it must have taken is crazy. There is sooooo much sand. No matter how hard you try you will get sand in everything by the time you leave. When I visited the park it was it was Sunday May 28th, during the Memorial Day weekend. If you want to visit during this time you should know a few things. One of the rangers said that the day I visited was the busiest time of the year. Also, if you are planning on staying at a hotel in Alamosa make sure to book well in advance. When I was there it was graduation time so all of the hotels in the area were booked solid, as the graduates reserved hotel rooms in the area to celebrate. This could make it pretty difficult to find somewhere to stay. When you go to the park make sure to go early in the day. There is a lot less people to contend with and easier in general. The parking lot filled up by 9:00am and after that you have to park on the road. This means you have to walk a ways to get to Medano creek and dune field but it isn't terribly far though and won't be much of a problem. From up on the dunes you can see the road coming in to the park. By 9:30am the line to get into the park started to get pretty long. Pretty much as far as I could see. Also as the day goes on the sand gets really hot. When they say to bring shoes out on the dunes they aren't kidding. I arrived at 8:00am and the sand was not bad at all. I was barefoot until around 11:00am when I noticed the sand starting to get really hot....like holy crap hot! You don't want to run down the dunes with burning feet to get to the creek because you forgot your shoes. After I put on my sneakers on I was fine. Even if you go sledding on the small dunes on the side of the main dune field the sand gets really hot. Bring them for your kids too. I saw several children without shoes and they were jumping around screaming and crying because the sand was so hot. Not fun for anyone. If you are sledding there are small dunes at the edge of the dune field that you can go on. If you want sled on the higher dunes you can, just remember that you have to climb back up after every run. One couple I saw had rented a couple sleds but only one seemed to slide down the sand pretty well. The other one didn't seem to want to slide very well at all. They even put wax on the bottom but it didn't seem to help. I'm not 100% sure but I think the one that didn't slide very well was a newer sled and not worn down by the sand very much. Might be a thing you want to check on when you rent one. When you first start you have to cross Medano Creek, there is no bridge over it so you have to go through it. It is not deep at all, maybe a foot or so deep and is not a problem. It is a nice place to cool your feet in, splash around in, make sand castles...etc, especially if you have kids. When you go up the dunes try to walk in the footprints of other people, the sand is more compact there. You won't sink as much and it will be a little easier (I might have imagined it but to me it seemed a little easier). From the time I got there to the time I left I probably spend a total of around 4 hours. However I typically take my time to see everything and to take in the view, but you could probably get by with around 2-2.5 hours to see what you need to. Of course it all depends on how much you trek/sled around the dunes and how fast you climb.","December 30, 2017",Worth A Visit,34,"Marshfield, Wisconsin",5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This is an amazing place but definitely make sure you fill up with gas before thinking you will just take a quick turn off the highway for a sightseeing excursion for 20min. which in effect will take 2-3 hours. I put my car in Eco Mode to reserve my gas tank and coasted to the Visitor Center , (thankful I had 1/2 tank to get there and back ) enjoyed a brief tour of the displays, relics, history and preview of trails, as well a granola bar and carried my own bottled water...then decided to take the .5 mile trail which lead to a pavilion (not interesting ) unless you are planning a conference or a cookout. The Visitor Center guide advised me the base is 2 miles down the road so I returned to my car and drove 2miles, then entered the Sand Dune Park and hiked to one of the peaks.

We saw several people with sand sleds that had been rented locally and they were having a wonderful time on the dunes. I plan to return with the grandkids next year so they can enjoy sand sledding.

It’s hotter in the valley but you won’t experience the extreme climate changes as often. It’s a gorgeous National Park where you can do a junior ranger program and actually climb the dunes. Be warned that the sand is soft in most places. It is hard to hike but worth it. Be warned that sand will get EVERYWHERE. Renting a slide to slide the hills is highly recommended.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,I loved this place. I came here on a Saturday and there was a handful of people but you easily could find your own little spot away from everyone and be at peace. The fee to enter is $15 (I was alone so not sure if they charge by carful or by person.) Good info at welcome center. There's a small creek you have to cross and I assume at different times of the year it can be wider or deeper. I was here in late October and it was barely an inch deep. Sure it was cold but not so much so that you couldn't walk through it in barefoot. Probably a good idea to bring a towel if you're gonna go barefoot so you can dry your feet if ya wanna put shoes back on. After that it's just a free for all - there's giant mound of sand with various peeks and valleys in front of you so just pick your way and go. Some people bring boards and sleds to ride down the dunes. There's a shop right before you get to the park gates called Oasis where you can rent. I just worked my way up the dunes and ultimately just found a nice quiet spot away from anyone else and just say and enjoyed the view. Of course I couldn't resist taking a tumble down the dunes. I arrived with pants on cause the temp was about mid 40s but I brought shorts as well and once I got to the park I changed into them. Glad I did cause once I started hiking up the dunes it was getting warm. I really loved this place. I could've stayed all day had I not had to return to Colorado Springs for work.

We decided to take the time to venture to the Park and we were not disappointed. It was amazing to see sand dunes, creeks, wetlands, grasslands, forests and alpine tundra in one location. This is definitely a unique place. Stop by the visitor center for the informative 15 minute film before heading to the Dunes. We only had a couple of extra hours so we went to the Dunes Parking area, crossed the creek and explored the Dunes. You'll need to take off your shoes (or not) to cross the creek.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This is definitely an ’out of the way place’. We were there at the end of September and had to drive 17 miles back to Blanca just to get to dinner. The local restaurant was already closed for the season! However, the Great Sand Dunes are a wonderful place to explore. The Visitor’s Center had a great video and other exhibits that explained how all that sand got there and why it stays. We stay one night at the Great Sand Dunes Lodge, which was basic but clean and friendly. During the summer, the hummingbird feeders outside each unit are a real treat. If you are planning to hike on the dunes, plan on crossing one of the creeks — no bridges!! The creek is very shallow. So either take your shoes off [recommended in warm weather] or bring along waterproof footwear. If you are lucky, you will see the ‘surge flow’, a stream flowing in rhythmic waves over the sand.The day we were there, it had recently rained, so there was not the usual amounts of loose sand on the dunes. Do be aware that it can be a windy place, especially up on the dunes.

You do have to cross the ice cold water to get to the dunes so take your socks and shoes off or hop on your husband's back like we did. It was cold but glorious.

We ventured as far as we could to one of the highest points and the views were absolutely spectacular! You must take water - even though it was a coolosh day, climbing the Dunes is thirsty work.

The dunes look a bit small from the road, especially with the Sangro de Christo mountains in the background. When you start approach them (and hiking up them for the ride) the size becomes apparent. What an amazing afternoon going up and down the dunes in the sleds/boards.

But be warned: the trek to the first dune to slide on is about 1/2 mile through rocky sand, and then just sand, and is quite tiring. Sliding is fun but sorta hard to get the hang of it. We spent about 2 hours sledding and were totally exhausted (it was about 75 deg. that day). And the sand starts getting really hot, so you've got to have shoes. I'd suggest tennis shoes or boots, and not Keen-type, which we wore and were sorry. Hiking to the very highest dune you can see from the visitor center yields a view of more dunes, and not far-off landscape.

August is a very hot and dry month at Sand Dunes National Park so bring lots of water and wear socks and a hat when you visit!!!! It's easier to walk in your bare feet but the sand is too hot. Take your time, walk slow and enjoy the view. It's a cool place to see and have fun if you can forget the heat. You can sand surf, I am not sure where you would get the boards but many people had the same type.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"PROS: - it's beautiful..- Nice wet Creek as you approach the beginning of the walk to the dunes to slide. CREEK IS ONLY FULL DURING CERTAIN MONTHS..today was just a small amount of run off water but plenty of wet sand and sand toys. - Fun to slide down.CONS: #1 MUST HAVE A WOOD SLIDE OR RENT ONE.. Walmart and Target snow sleds WILL NOT WORK..-The walk to the sledding area..the minimum walk is around 1/2 mile..want steeper sledding, you have to walk more.- NOT an easy walk. Imagine walking in slushy slushy snow with ski boots on..No flip flops..you have to have good hiking or sneakers to walk in the sand. It's a hard walk .. especially for young children. - we went in September and it was boiling hot making the walk even harder.._ walking up even the mildest dune to sled, can be physically tiring if your not in good shape. My husband is in great shape and he was extremely tired after 10 walks up a small dune, helping our 7 year old. I am 135 lbs 5""3 but I haven't been running lately. I barely could do one hike back up. Sand is HOT in hot months so good shoes are important.Sledding: waxing..you have to wax your board at every run..every time you go down..Overall, I'm glad we went but if I had to so it over, I would have gone in October. Kids only lasted 30 minutes because they didn't have the strength to continue. These are not grass hills..walking back up these hills can be quite challenging.

Unless you are 62 years old, or on active duty military: you will have to pay a small admission fee.  There is a small stream of water that comes down from the mountains. You are free to wade through this, or walk through the sand up to the dunes. This type of environment is seldom seen in the world.

I was hesitant about coming here because my husband is not a hiker, but he was able to play in the lower dunes. The creek was low so we crossed it easily with the two dachshunds and then just played in the sand for a while. Got there about 9am and glad we did because by the time we left at 10 it was already hot! Then went to Zapata Falls and that was amazing too. I didn't expect such a long drive up a bumpy road or such a tedious walk to the falls but that too was super fun and well worth it ","September 3, 2017",Loved this spot!,4,atlanta,5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,This national park receives fewer visitors than other parks in Colorado but is definitely worth a visit. The sand dunes with the Sangre de Cristo mountains in the background offers spectacular vistas and plenty of photographic opportunities. Families with kids will have a blast exploring the sand dunes.Tips:- You will need to wade across the shallow Medano creek to reach the dunes so prepare to get your feet wet- Its best to attempt scaling the dunes during late afternoon or early morning as the surface temperature gets extremely hot in the summer (best time is after 4pm and before 9am in the summer)- It takes approx 75-90 minutes to scale some of the taller dunes. Most people (even those in good shape) have to rest often to catch their breath due to the high elevation of the park. Carry plenty of water- The late afternoon sun casts some interesting shadows over the dunes and offers plenty of photographic opportunities. The sand dunes look pristine in the early morning especially after a windy night as all the footprints disappear- Watch out for the storms and wind conditions. Walking back to the car was even more difficult than climbing the dunes with sand blowing in your face/eyes. Keep your photo equipment shielded as the sand will enter every nook and cranny- I would highly recommend the 4x4 pathfinder tour of Medano pass run by Cam Benton. He is the only licensed operator in the park and the tour is excellent along some challenging terrain. Do not attempt this drive in a sedan,"September 2, 2017",Spectacular scenery (read review for photography and other tips),77,,5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We found out at the visitor center that you had to exit the park to rent dune riding sleds. Do not be like us, and please stop at the Oasis restaurant on the right of the road just before the park gate to rent dune sleds. It will save on frustration.A truly beautiful and unique park, and one that should not be missed in Colorado. It's an off the beaten path location, but if you did not prepare with food and drinks, the Oasis restaurant is good enough to meet your demands.The visitor center is well done with enough ""stuff"" to give you an adequate education on the context of the sand dunes. Just outside the visitor center is a nice viewing area of the dunes complete with binocular viewing stations. We left the visitor center and drove to the first big parking area. It was fairly crowded when we got there so be prepared. If you can get here early, it may be a wise decision.Once you leave the parking area you are forced to cross a small stream that varies with depth seasonally. At our visit in August, it was ankle deep but very cold. After the water encounter, you have to traverse a fairly long stretch of sandy, flat area before you access the first set of dunes. It looks easy but the depth of the sand will give you a work out. Also, like a dummy, I went totally bare foot, and approximately half way between the stream and the first set of dunes is a mine field of sharp, rocky fragments which were not too pleasant on the feet. The ""mine field"" does end in about 20 yards then the remaining jaunt is all sand.The teens had a great time sledding down the dunes. It does require some effort, and thank God, it did wear them out. I would have loved to hike up to one of the high, prominent dunes, but it would have been a difficult hike for us old folks. Just getting to the second set of dunes was killer.We all loved this place. The juxtaposition of sand with snow capped peaks in the background was amazing. It appears man made or contrived, and the fact that it's all Mother Nature makes this park site a true gem worth the effort to visit and enjoy.If you have difficulty walking please be mindful that the sand will be your enemy. My knees were rocking. You also have to navigate that stream. Prepare accordingly.We spent well over 3 hrs here and loved every minute of it. We even had the unique opportunity of being there during a rain shower. The lighting on the dunes because of the storm was breath taking.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Most people visit Colorado for the mountains; skiing/snow boarding, hiking, fishing, rock climbing, etc. Most visitors completely miss one of the most interesting and unusual sites in all the United State, the Great Sand Dunes. Some tips for when (not if) you go:- Expect the wind to blow and if the weather report says it will be stronger than usual, expect to be pelted with windblown sand- In the summer, the sand will be very hot so plan to wear foot protection- In the winter it can get very cold on the dunes because technically it a desert environment- Forget cardboard or the snow saucer in the garage, they won't slide on the sand unless you happen to be there when the sand is very wet. Plan to rent sandboards or sand sleds at the local shops outside the park- Depending on the time of year, plan to wade across Medano Creek to get from the parking lot to the dunes. The creek is usually shallow and easy to cross but you will get wet and the sand will stick to you. Bring some way to rinse your self off when you get back to the car.- take water with you because, although you may not be visibly sweating, you will rapidly loose water from your body in the high and dry, windy conditionsI recommend you read the wikipedia page on the Great Sand Dunes National Park before you go.","August 24, 2017",A Hidden Colorado Gem,234,Colorado,5

They are of varying heights so all abilities can access. The dunes are surrounded by mountains so it is very scenic. There is a nice visitor's center with a movie and gift shop. We stayed in RV park on site which was close to the visitor's center. The campground was not full hookup but they did have a store with limited hours and a large ampitheater where we listened to a park ranger talk.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"You can't go wrong with a national park/preserve. It's beautiful, and clean and has a impressive visitors center. The roads through the park are minimal. There are are areas for off road vehicles, for more exploration of the park. Kite flying, hiking, and sledding down the dunes are options for recreation suggested by the park rangers. Sledding works best during the dry season. We tried using plastic snow sleds with minimal success. Wooden sleds rented by the one store near the park are around 25$ for the day. Our kids used the sleds a couple of times, and then tired of climbing up the dunes. There is a stream(seasonal) that you cross before you get to the dunes that is fun to explore as well. Camping sites are available to reserve. Not sure about RV sites. That being said the park is in the middle of nowhere. There are a couple of options for lodging, a unassuming looking restaurant with decent food and a small store all on the east side of the park. NO wi fi. No close towns with any decent amenities.

Today was the best as I took my son who was visiting from Arkansas, my great niece who attends college here and her 'fella"" who are both from California. Looking at everything through other's eyes was game changing. We rented a sled (a first for me) at the Oasis and had such a great time. We weren't able to get up the biggest dunes but even the smaller ones provided a couple hours of fun. Got much more sledding in than those who took the LONG walk to the top and then just made one ride down because they were too tired to climb again. The key seems to be know your limits, take it slow and keep hydrated!Not sure what the perfect footwear is as hiking through loose sand is not easy and gets a little hot for bare feet. Wet tennis shoes seem to pull you down (first time I've ever seen water still in the creek in August) so I took off shoes for water and had a towel to dry off and don shoes again. A lot of people had on sandals and seemed to do ok. For those less inclined to climb, there are a couple nice and easy walking trails by the visitors center.

We took a short hike up the dunes since we didn't start very early. I suggest looking at the park website ahead of time to prepare for a day here. The visitor center was very nice and as always, the rangers were so kind and helpful. Plan to get very sandy and have a change of clothes ready. The areas to rinse off were pretty busy and there is a small changing area. I suggest renting the sand boards or sleds, but we weren't able to the day we were there because the dunes were wet. Be sure to stop by the visitor center for a map and to check out the interpretive exhibits and educational opportunities. Also, if you want to hike up the dunes, get an early start and take plenty of water. The sand gets hot very quickly.

Although you can rent them for a full day, you'll probably only be able to last for half. Try to go as soon as they open (8am) so you can get an early start before the mid-day sun beats down on the dunes. Most people took their shoes off to walk in the sand but then your feet burn like crazy. I kept having to stand on my board to give my feet a break from the 115 degree sand.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Hard to find worthy adjectives to describe how awe-inspiring and vast these dunes are. The view from the road as you drive up gives you a sense of the enormity of the place and the approach to the dunes is simply gorgeous. The visitor center provides history and context about the formation of these dunes in a place you would not necessarily expect to find them and provides ample rationale for why they should be protected from development so we can all enjoy this national treasure. Your park entry fee wokrs for 7 days so save that receipt. We spent a late afternoon and then returned the next morning to see the park in a different light. After crossing over Medano Creek, you are at the base of the dunes with the Sangre de Cristo mountain range towering in the background over even the highest dunes. It is a truly magnificent view. After taking this in, I recommend you get on your good walking/hiking shoes (sand can be very hot in the summer) and start your hike up the dunes. Until you make it to the higher dunes, you don't have a full sense of the magnitude of the dunes. Once you get higher, you get 360 degree views of the front and back sides of the dunes. Climbing the dunes isn't easy, sometimes it's one step forward, two steps back, but the effort is rewarded ten-fold. Highly recommend taking the time to make the climb. This park is open 24/7 and I would love to return to spend an evening at the dunes to see the stars.

You walk across a creek (stream - about 1-2 inches of water) to get to the Dunes and the sand is super soft. It's also hot - we had sandals and sneakers - I'd recommend sneakers and socks if you really want to walk. Walking isn't easy and the kids wanted to be carried, but we got to the vista of one large dune carrying them. The kids loved playing in the water the most. The drive to and from the park is as awesome as the Dunes. The drive is gorgeous and I'd do it again and again. We didn't sled here but it looked like the sledders were having a blast.

My friend and I brought our kids, age range 9-16, to visit the Sand Dunes. We used the 4th Grade National Park passes to get in free, which saved $30 between the two cars. Rent sleds at a place called Oasis, which is about 3 miles before you reach the park entrance. They are about $20 each. The visitor center is nice. Wear shoes - not sandals or flip flops. Sand is VERY hot. We were there midday - would probably be better early or late. The stream cooled our feet. Bring towels and lots of water. There were people that even brought chairs and shelter, which is probably not a bad idea if you're spending a few hours there. There are outdoor showers to rinse off feet/hair/body parts covered in sand. The sand sticks like crazy! The tallest dunes are tall! I didn't climb them but watching my 16 year old freaked me out!

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Food/drinks: snacks and water at visitor center. Small restaurant before you get in the great sand dunes. Cost: $15 for a car. After you pay, drive a little ways, on left visitor center =use restroom ( women's 5 stalls usually a line ), then drive a little ways, then there is a small sign that says dunes to the left. There are a bunch of cars. There are pull outs prior to entering the park where you can take pictures. Worth it: yes!! Gluten free available: no. Bring your own food and water. Picnic area right next to parking. There are picnic tables and grills to use= lots. And you can park right by your picnic area. No seating anywhere at the dunes. Employees friendly: yes. Length of time spent here: 2-3 hrs. Perfect time of day to go: morning in summer, so it doesn't get too hot. For kids, couples: all ages. Restrooms: there are outhouses where you park next to the dunes. Restrooms easy to find: yes. Parking: Free! Lots of parking, even for RV's. Fun/ interesting: yes. Never seen anything like it. Hard walking in sand. You get a good work out. Ground uneven. No stairs. You can rent sleds at the building to your right, prior to entering the dunes. There are no signs up advertising this. But we were glad we didn't, because it was a hot, tiring walk up the dunes, and carrying anything would be more tiring. But yes, the kids love the sleds, and yes they do slide pretty good. Bring your own if you can. Wish they had 4-wheelers you could rent. But I get they want to preserve this area. Need to bring water: yes lots. Sunscreen: yes, lots. Special shoes/clothes: bring Sandals and tennis shoes. Swim suit for kids and or adult. There is a good flowing water stream before you get to the dunes. Feels great on the feet. Not deep at all.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This was our last stop on a 12-day trip to Colorado. Thanks to other reviews, we knew that we could rent a sled or snow board at the restaurant/shop located just 3-4 miles outside of the entrance to the park. It was $20/day to rent a sled and we rented two for the five of us. It's a toss up if you want to rent one for each person. The cost adds up and you'd have to each carry a sled the whole time but you could bypass a few of the steep climbs required to hand it off to the next person. Park in the dunes lot so you don't have to walk the mile from the Visitor's Center to the trailhead. You will walk through water at the start of the trail so either wear water shoes or plan to take off your socks and shoes to walk through. Don't wear flip flops or sandals- the sand can be hot and it's a lot of climbing. The climbing was tough! We thought we would go to the High Dune but opted for a shorter climb since we were so out of breath. The kids (8, 11, 13) actually stopped and sat down while my husband and I (in our 40's) slowly made the climb to the top. We had the sleds with us and really enjoyed the ride down! Use your feet to help steer so you don't go sideways. If you are going fast and the sled turns, the sled will wedge into the sand and you will go flying. If you go down a steep hill, it's a TON of fun but... man, that walk back to the top is a killer! Bring water! We had two camelbak hydration backpacks and they were perfect. The only negative was that we didn't realize just how sandy we would be when we were done. We were literally covered from head to toe with sand and, since the van was packed and ready for our drive home, we didn't plan a change of clothes. There is a shower area out in the open by the bathrooms that helps get rid of some of the sand but, despite our best efforts, we were still finding sand in our socks, shoes, hair, and underwear the rest of the way home. All in all, it was a fantastic experience and we would highly recommend this to anyone in the area!","July 27, 2017",Rent the boards and pack water!,27,,5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"A pleasant surprise stop on our way from Durango to Royal Gorge, sorry we didn't have more time ... To really make this stop worth while you need 2-3 hours, we just couldn't stay that long. It's easy to underestimate the scale of the height and breadth of the dunes from a distance, even from the visitor center. It wasn't until we crossed the little stream that we realized the base of the dunes were still a good 15 min walk, and then seeing people as specks on the dunes themselves revealed enormous heights lay further ahead. I estimated it would take another hour probably to scale the first dune. With soft steep sand and a 7k+ elevation, one would have to take their time and be packing water to boot. I can only imagine what a grand view it must be when at the top you are able to look out at the rest of the dune field behind it.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"My bucket list is to visit ALL 59 National Parks. Our family vacation this summer took us to Colorado. (Group of 10 with youngest 13yrs old and oldest 60yrs old). Driving up from Houston, TX we looked into what NP's we could stop and visit on our way up to Breckenridge, CO. We decided to include both Great Sand Dunes NP & Black Canyon of Gunnison NP (western detour, but worth it). First travel day was rough 14 hrs to Trinidad, CO. BUT glad we did because made next day EASY! Great Sand Dunes NP is about 1-1/2hr drive from Trinidad, CO.With a large group and all the preparation involved, we didn't make it to the dunes till about 11am. Our goal was 9:30am. Needless to say, the afternoon heat made our visit more difficult than we would have liked. We initially wanted to hike up one of the taller dunes. After making the treck of about 1/2 mile out to smaller dunes and sledding down a couple of times, our INITIAL grand idea to hike a dune guickly went AWAY! We had a great time, but it was EXHAUSTING! Walking up those sand dunes and even just walking on hot loose sand was enough to wipe out our entire group! NO one wanted to attempt the hike up a high sand dune. Had we gotten there EARLY in morning, maybe!Here's a couple tips:DEFINITELY wear tennis shoes or hiking boots with SOCKS! Long sleeves and pants for the guys in the group and capri leggins for girls. Definitely include a hat & sunglasses! It's the beach on steriods!I made mistake of wearing tennis shoes with large mesh holes and I SURE DID regret it! The sand worked it's way thru the holes and my feet felt like they were on FIRE! I had to stop several times and let sand out! I even had socks on! The comments about the sand temperature being 150 degrees is NO exaggeration! It's weird because I didn't experience this on the treck out to the dunes, only on way back. The sand temperature changed that much in 1hrs time!The outside showers are SUPER COLD! So unless you want to endure that, plan on a good dry towel wipe off to get sand off. I wiped out several times from sledding so I had sand everywhere! BUT I'm glad I did it, it was fun! I'm 58yrs old, so if I can do it, anyone can! We had planned to hike out to Zapata Falls after our Sand Dunes NP visit. BUT everyone in the group was EXHAUSTED! It's our fault for getting there so late in the day! So I was disappointed we didn't get to do that! But, everyone was tired and we had a good 2hr drive to Gunnison, CO to our hotel for the night and everyone wanted to take a SHOWER!Overall, Great Sand Dunes NP is an unique area and worth the visit. I will be honest here, I'm not really a ""beach"" person so sand everywhere is NOT my love. I am SUPER glad I visited, but it's definitely not a NP I will be visiting twice. I'm more of the woods/mountain with cool lakes kinda girl. Living in Houston, TX I LIVE for days of getting out of the HOT/HUMID Texas Heat. Great Sand Dunes NP is not the place for that!GLAD I WENT, but won't visit again, it's a ""CHECK OFF THE BUCKET LIST"" kinda NP for me!","July 25, 2017",Sahara Desert with Rocky Mtns back drop!,25,Baytown,4
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"When you think of Colorado, you think of mountains and rivers and snow. The sand dunes come out of left field! As you approach from the southeast you see what looks like white mountains amid brown mountains. Then you get close and realize it is sand. Once in the park, you can actually climb the dunes but beware it is hot and very strenuous. Rangers told us they have actually had 911 calls from people stuck on the dunes; they just couldn't finish. If you go early spring (April-May) there is a ""pool type river"" in front of the dunes created by melting snow off the mountains which afford splashing/sandcastle making.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"A wonderful place to visit. In October, there were relatively few people. It's at about 10,000' elevation, so it was pleasantly warm and sunny in the daytime. We sat outside our motel overlooking the Dunes for a while in the evening, even though it was quite chilly at night.  In mid-July, we met family members there. It was quite crowded in the parking lot for the Dunes, but we found parking even at noon. We could not find a place to park in the lot for the picnic area, however, where we had had a picnic lunch in October and had loved being by the narrowleaf cottonwoods lining the wetlands. There were more people hiking on the Dunes themselves than in October, but they were not crowded.  The summer monsoons had just started during our July visit. As a result, because it had rained in the surrounding mountains the night before our July visit, and during our overnight stay, our grandkids were unable to rent dune sleds from the nearby vendor at Oasis. They were told that when it is damp, it is not good for their sleds, so it was their decision, not a Park policy to prohibit sledding. There were compensations because of the rain, however: 1) the dunes were somewhat more solid so walking up them was easier than in October, when even a modest slope was very hard work. Half of our family hiked all the way to the top. I walked with my granddaughter much farther than I had in October. 2) There was water in Medano Creek from the mountain runoff, making for delightful wading for the grandkids (11 and 13 yrs. old) and me. This typically occurs when the snow melts in late May and June in the mountains, but is unusual later in the summer. It is said to be even more crowded in May and June.  We hiked the Mosca Trail in October, and enjoyed the aspen fall color. Both times, we drove to the Great Sand Dunes Hot Springs in Hooper 30-40 minutes away for lunch and swimming/soaking in the pools. The Dunes are only a little more than 2 hours from where we live in Taos, so are becoming a recurring treat for us.","July 22, 2017","Two visits, 10/16 and 7/17",5,"Taos, New Mexico",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,The sand dunes are great for board sledding which you can rent. It has a creek that runs through it and fun for everyone. Plenty of hiking trails and camping available. Go early in the morning by afternoon the sand can reach 150 degrees so barefoot is not an option.

It is sand, and if you stopping in a middle of more drives afterward, be prepared, bring clothes to change, the showers there are very weak, bring bucket to help you wash the kiddos before driving, 2. the sand is hot,but with good sandals , it is still doable to hike the 300 m to the bottom of the dunes, climbing to the top was too much for us on those very hot hours, bring a lot of water.3.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Experiencing the Dunes should be on everyone's list. There are so many positive reviews about the experience, so I will highlight some particulars. We brought plastic snow sleds, but were told they wouldn't work in the sand. We did rent two sit down wooden sleds which worked once we figured out how to keep level. Another family told us that their plastic sleds had worked fine. Plan your trip to be in the morning. First, due to the summer heat and second, there are frequent thunderstorms in the afternoon wth lightning. The visitor center warns about being on the Dunes during lightning. So we hit the dunes first thing, and then played in the lower river bed as lunch approached. Girls, aged 9 & 12, really enjoyed the sand building and mud carving. Pack snacks/drinks for hydration. There are sand wash off showers at the parking lot bathrooms. Great place to explore and wander! See how high you can go on the Dunes and prepared to be exhausted and sore...

It let us get up early to beat the heat- the sand was already too hot for comfort by 10 am. It was nice to splash in Medano Creek afterwards- late June it was a few inches deep most places.

You can walk up the creek, as far as you would like. The atmosphere is that of a busy beach with lots of tourists and locals. Young grandchildren loved the water so we stayed much longer than we had expected - should have packed food and more beverages. One must be well-prepared if you plan to go into the dunes - very hot sand on a summer day and hard to walk on the the fine sand.

Be prepared with closed toed shoes for the walk to the dunes. I had to turn back in my flip flop type shoes because it was so hot the soles of my feet were burning. If you bring a dog and it is hot don't leave it in your car and don't try to hike to the dunes with it. Just stay in the shallow creek and let your dog cool off.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This is one national park where one can create the path you walk on, because on the dunes there are no trails. One reason for that is because the sand is always moving and your foot prints can disappear in minutes. To get to the dunes one has to cross a creek and there is no bridge. You ford the stream and that puts you right at the dunes. Choose your path and start walking. After a while, when you think you must be getting near the top you look up to find that you aren't even half way. Find a dune with a steep slope and you can just slide down it. Look up to the top and you soon realize that those moving dots are people. All national parks are great, but this one is very different.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"My wife and I were there to see the magnificence of the sand dunes and to do some hiking. The hiking in the immediate vicinity of the visitor centre is okay but nothing to get too excited about. We did Mosca Pass on the first day and while a nice trail, it felt a bit of an anti-climax as the top of the trail didn't mark anything in particular. The sand dunes themselves are phenomenal. You have to see them to comprehend the scale. We hiked High Dune which is 700 ft high. Set off at 9am and can tell you it was hard yards in a few places. Stick to the ridges and you'll do fine. Don't climb the face of a dune - we did a short one and that was a bad move! Views from the top spectacular and worth the effort. If we had more time would have gone to Star Dune. Climb Dune Overlook as well if you have the time. It's not a long or difficult hike but provides a super view over the dune fields. We also went to Zapata Falls - you can see dune fields from there too but it's a bit far away to be any good. Oh, and if you want to take photos of the dunes, go early as the shadows are most dramatic at first light (at least in July they are). If you go at sunset, the sun is behind the dunes so you you're facing all shadow so much less dramatic.","July 3, 2017",Amazing wilderness,17,"Windsor, Canada",5

We only spent a couple of hours at the park and enjoyed every minute of it!Here are a couple of tips. The mosquitoes can be brutal so bring bug spray! You'll want to wear some shoes that breath and can be easily cleaned because you'll have sand everywhere and will be walking through water. Rent the sand sleds from Kristi Mountain Sports in Alamosa. Our kids loved sledding down the Dunes so the $18 per day to rent the sleds was worth it for us. Go in the morning because the heat would make hiking the dunes be awful! To be honest, I wouldn't even recommend going if it's during the heat of the day. Most importantly, bring lots of water!! You'll be hiking sand dunes which is much more difficult than hiking solid terrain. I hike often but the dunes wore me out! Go slow and enjoy the views!

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Huge sanddunes, not a kiddie playground. Be in shape if you climb all the way.

Bring mosquito spray as you will wade through the creek at the bottom of the dunes and after the parking lot. for best photos, do be here very early or toward sunset. the sand is HOT HOT so you need soles on your feet. You will not forget this experience. Promise. Not risky except for sunburn or sand in your clothing.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"I normally don't review the parks themselves but this one requires some info that I wished I'd known about. To get to the dunes you have to cross Medano creek. Late summer it's a trickle, when we went 6-8"" deep in spots. We got across fine but we would have worn different footwear had we known. June to late July is mosquito season. We arrived at peak and were driven off. Fortunately the Visitor center sells a non deet citronella like repellent. Worked as good as the stuff we left at the hotel not realizing we would need it so badly. Go early, the sand gets hot -really hot. If you rent a sand board $20 from the store just outside the park, gloves might be a good thing to bring along.The hike up is tough, but worth it.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Beautiful views and amazing experience. So very unique! We enjoyed our visit. Be prepared to wade across Medano Creek, which levels may vary. It is a unique stream as it surges, similarly to the small waves on a lakeshore. The dunes are a short walk beyond the stream. We rented sand sleds and a sand board. They are very expensive to rent, and they really aren't worth the $20 per day in my opinion. You also need to pay attention to the wind. It was quite breezy our visit and we were completely sand blasted in less than an hour.

It is amazing to see the height of these sand dunes and I am glad that the river was running - it was going really fast. I would suggest hanging out there a day. Especially if you plan on climbing the dunes. It is a really long walk even before you get to the dune itself to climb it.

We parked and walked through a tiny boardwalk to see tons of people, mostly families basking in the sun playing in the Modano River! A small river, or waterway really with a complete sand bottom. It was almost more fascinating than the giant sand dunes in the near distance! Kids building sand castles! Cold water trickling through making enough space for everyone to walk, run, build and float. Was't more than a foot deep in any spot and CRYSTAL CLEAR!

Enjoyed a sunrise walk on the dunes -- less bugs, less wind. When the wind does kick up, it is forceful (as is the sun: come prepared)! Great for photographers.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"A big consideration for visiting this national park is when you go. If you are mostly interested in the sand dunes themselves, then realize that hottest months of summer are a little warm. It is high desert, so while warm in late June, it is comfortable enough that plenty of people are climbing and playing on the dunes. Cooler months would make it more enjoyable.For us, I really wanted to see the seasonal creek at the base of the sand dunes and the associated surge flow of water in the creek. The creek only flows a couple months each year, and the highest flow, where the surge phenomena is observed, seems to peak in early June. In 2017, it peaked on 6/9/17, and we visited 6/19/17, ten days after the peak. The water flow was less than half the peak and the surge flow, while visible, wasn't even and inch high.From the graphs at the visitor center, the water flow seems to build up relatively slowly, then drop off fast. If you are planning a trip around seeing this, then I recommend late May or the first part of June for seeing the highest flow.Be ready to splash around in the water. Barefoot or sandals work well. The creek bed is pure sand. No rocks at all. The water is pleasant in June. It doesn't even feel cold. For young kids and their parents, this place is better than the beach. The water is warm and shallow, and there is zero chance a wave will knock your child into deep water. There is no deep water and the maximum surge/wave size is about six inches. You can build sand castles all day.If you do stay all day in June, bring shade. The picnic area, where there is some shade, doesn't have a view of the creek. Otherwise it is essentially a flat sand beach. There were a few bugs, mostly mosquitos in late June, but nothing too bad.It is a long drive from anywhere to get to the park, but for most people, all you will probably do it hit the visitor center and then within a mile or so is the primary parking area with access to the creek and the dunes themselves. You can go beyond the main access point, but it looks like that is mostly to access trailheads or maybe camping. We didn't go there. The parks website has that information. You have to cross the creek and walk a couple hundred yards in flat sand to get to the sand dunes.Bring an ice chest with food and water. Also towels and dry shoes to change into after playing in the creek. Kids will want swimsuits so they can really play in the water. Bring shade if you plan to stay there a long time. We just ate our Subway sandwiches on a blanket laid on the sand and did fine in June without shade for that period of time.In the picnic area they do have changing rooms and beach style outdoor showers to wash off your entire body or just your feet.The park and the creek is dog friendly.Cost for access to the national park is $15 per car.","June 22, 2017",Information for Planning a Trip to the Great Sand Dunes NP,46,Arizona,4
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This is a must see! The sand dunes were an amazing site but go early, the sand can get hot. There was still plenty of water in the creek to cool off in when we were there. Hiking up the dunes is not easy and wear sneaker, not sandals. Those wearing sandals didn't make it very far in the hot sand. They provide you places to wash the sand off and change, if you played in the steam of melted snow. We had a great time and it wasn't as crowded as I heard it could be. There were a lot of mosquitos in the parking lot and vegetation around the water so take bug spray.

Whether it was our arrival time or the beginning of May, the entrance gate was up and wasn't guarded, so we were able to enter for free. With all the precautions regarding the blowing sand, it looked as if a small rain preceded us. They say to take a bandana to cover your face from the blowing sand dust, but that wasn't a problem. Crossing the creek or small river to get to the dunes was cold and fast moving. We arrived after 4:00 PM so the time spent was short lived. Even though we didn't get a sled (which we heard was fun), the walking around and surrounding area was awesome.

Our campsite was good - could have used more shade - but unobstructed view of the dunes and the incredible sunsets. Bathrooms had flush toilets, cold water sinks, no showers.

When we were there you had to cross water to get to the dunes, but it felt great to cool off. Sand was hot, so if there in warmer months, don't recommend sandals, but be prepared to take shoes off to cross the water.

The visitor center is interesting and explains the park's formation really well, especially for kids that are 10 and up. The river that runs between the parking lot and the dunes is the best part. Wear a bathing suit, bring a tube, and enjoy splashing around in the cold water as it flows past the dunes. At it's deepest, it's only about 18"" deep. Some people even brought tents and coolers to set up in the flat dark sand next to the river. After crossing the river, you can put on hiking boots to start the long, long hike up the dunes. Only do this if you are really committed to the heat and the difficulty of climbing massive sand dunes. There are clean bathrooms and outside showers to clean up after playing. One other note, if you are in an RV, the parking lot for the river is really NOT user friendly. It's tight and crowded with very little room to make the turns.

The sand is very hot so it is best to climb in tennis shoes . The only type of sled that can go down this type of snow is a wooden sled. You will need to wax the bottom of the sled to make it glide down the dune. There is a place outside the park where you can rent these. Plastic sleds and cardboard does not work on this sand.

Well this was a chance and I speculated what they might be like. When we driving towards the Great Dunes Park you could see them from about 20 miles away. At that point they looked big but not maybe what I expected. As we drove closer and closer I began to realize they were almost as tall as the mountains just behind them. I seen tiny, tiny spec's on the hills and noticed they were people. Lots of people scattered about. Wow, as we arrived I couldn't believe my eyes. It was beautiful and spectacular. Who would think sand could be so mesmerizing. If you want to see a natural creation and in awe of what Mother Nature can produce; you have to visit.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This is a beautiful park with the dunes in the front and snow capped mountains and alpine forest behind and around it. We visited here on the Friday before Memorial Weekend. We arrived around 8:30 a.m. and there were only a few other people. We saw quite a few deer near the visitor center. The parking for Medano Creek is just past the visitor center parking lot. We took our boots off to cross the creek. The water was only about ankle and shin deep with little surges or waves. It was cold at first, but not bad. After exiting the creek we walked in the sand barefoot for awhile just because it felt good, then we dried our feet with a small towel that we had in our pack, put our boots back on, and headed for High Dune. Some people were just heading straight up but we kind of zig zagged around where it wasn't so steep, but always heading up. There is no trail, you're just walking wherever on the dunes.This was a perfect time to go as the weather was mild. You could've went barefoot (some people were) as the sand never got hot. I would not want to go here when the weather is hot! We're both 61 yrs old and made it to the top of High Dune. It was tiring at times but we took it slow and rested a few times. The view from the top was worth it!! It is a must do. I think it took us 2 hrs to get to the top and only 30 min. to get down. By the time we got back down to Medano Creek there were lots of adults and children playing in the water. It really was like a scene at the beach. Then we went to the visitor center and watched the 20 min.film. We also did the very easy little 1/2 mile Montville Loop Trail which was in the forest along a creek, very pretty!

It's interesting reading about how the sand dune is formed and keeps reforming, and more interesting to climb on it and experience the phenomenon firsthand. We had to wade across Medano Creek to reach the dune, so if you are going during the wet season, be prepared with water shoes. I took a picture of my wife standing on a sand dune with a snow capped mountain in the background - that doesn't happen everyday.

We brought an inner tube, and it was moving enough that the kids could ride a long distance on the surge of the waves. It drops to a trickle later in the summer so floating isn't possible. Even as adults, we had fun playing in the water and the sand. Several people were sand sledding (which can be rented just outside the park), but we ran out of time to try it.We also enjoyed a crazy, windy hike on the dunes. We truly had sand in everything (and still do) but had a lot of fun! You can't really get a sense of the height of these dunes until you are standing on top of one. All hikers need to add this to their hiking experiences. Start early to avoid heat and storms. Also, bring regular hiking shoes if hiking the dunes. Hiking in sandals isn't as fun as it might appear.

We enjoyed wading in the creek. A crowd gathers in the section closest to the parking lot but you can just walk farther down to find a more secluded space. The water was not more than mid calf deep on an adult.I didn't care much for the dunes themselves. I enjoyed seeing them up close and watching kids jump and roll and slide down them but walking on them is an ordeal as you sink down in loose sand. It really gives your legs a workout.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"I found this park absolutely amazing. It is probably because my expectations were so low. My husband said lets go look at these sand dunes. I wasn't excited. I grew up near dunes on the shore. We had sand dunes in New Mexico. Seen one, seen them all - was my feeling. It was hot and not near much of anything else.But as we drove up, and I saw the expanse of these dunes, I was pretty blown away. We didn't have a long time to stay, but we did hike up to the first ridge to see a broader view of the dunes. It took longer than it looks like it would - distances were very deceiving.There is a better than average visitor center here. The film they offer is very worth the 15-20 minutes to watch. There are lots of exhibits (and a nice shop). The telescopes are really fun to use - especially if you don't have a lot of time here.We had just finished a geology of Colorado class when we came to visit. It was amazing to see in person what we learned about it class. Nothing you read will prepare you!Medano Creek was not flowing when we were there - I do think that would be worth coming back to see.","June 2, 2017",Amazing dunes - worth going out of your way to see,723,,5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"The highest/tallest sand dunes on record. You can hike up to the top, run down to the bottom...do what you wanna do !!! Really a cool destination. Probably a couple hours is all you would need...unless you want to really do some dune hiking, or a picnic, or play in the stream at the foot of the dunes (which is really neat, but it's usually a seasonal thing an best to do this in the Spring when the snowmelt feeds the stream.The park is bit out of the way, off the beaten path, but people still manage to fill up the campground and ""do the dunes"".","May 31, 2017",Great Sand Dunes National Park - truly a unique experience !!!,186,,5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Location checked off our bucket list. We arrived early at 8am during Memorial Weekend. Knowing how crowded it would be, we arrived early on Friday. But we first stopped at the Oasis store, near the park entrance, to rent sand boards. They are 20 dollars a day. We parked at the parking lot passed the visitor center. The creek to the sand dunes are feet away. If you park at the Visitor Center, it will be a good long hike to the dunes. I advise to arrive early has parking gets full by at least 9/10am. If not, come with your patience and you may have to park along the entrance road. We did notice the wind was calmer early in the morning until it picked up a few hours later. Due to the wind (small children) we didn't get to hike further up the dunes but we enjoyed the early sledding. The sand does get hotter further up. We spent most of our time cooling off by walking through the Medrano Creek. It's very cold but warms up as time goes by. We did see people picnic outside their vehicles, but there are at least 4 picnics tables across the parking lot. There are also restrooms and outdoor showers to rinse all the sand off. We spent most of the day there, but we will definitely plan again. The running creek is seasonal, so you will have to plan around that if you want to see it at full. Great visitor center with a gift shop and small museum. No near café or restaurants so don't forget your food and water during your visit, if not, you will fight for parking when if you return back.","May 30, 2017",Awesomeness,84,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Fantastic! - Pretty busy, but we went on a holiday weekend like dopes. Saturday around 11am, it took about an hour to get to the park gates; As soon as we got in and parked, a wind storm rolled in. So, we tried again the next day. 8am this time. No line. The river was Cold, the sand was perfect. On our way down around noon, the sand was super hot and the water was luke warm. Hard climb but so worth it! We packed a picnic and had a great time by the river. Lots of families, and lots of fun. Great for dogs. Even when crowded we could find our own private place to enjoy the river and sights. side note: camping was full - but that worked out for the better. parking was crazy on a holiday weekend. get there early (for heat reasons too).Wear tall socks and shoes if you go during the summer or late in the day. We were barefoot the beginning of the day in spring. not possible any other warm time.Dogs - bring a water bowl for sure. and maybe booties. our dog was fine the day off, but he was hurting the next day (probably heat and sand in unfamiliar places).

The dunes were astonishing!! We live near the Indiana Dunes which are nice, but these dunes were monstrous in size. My sons loved walking up and sand boarding down the hills. The flowing creek is nice, which we crossed in order to get to the dunes. Make sure to watch the short movie in the visitor center - it is very informative. The only thing that could be improved with this park is the lack of trail signs. We had a very difficult time locating the Dunes Overlook trail and the Sand Ramp trail. Evidently these trail heads are located in the actual campground. ","May 29, 2017",Great place to try sand boarding!! ,121,Midwest,4

Wear tennis shoes, not sandals and bring water and sunscreen! The winds can blow here, so watch the weather. Refresh yourself at the end of your hike with a wade in the Medino River, which was very shallow at the time we were visiting. The visitor center has an informative film and a few exhibits.

Sand is hot so don't forget some light sandals (maybe not flip flops which are hard to walk in). We camped at the dunes but the camnpsites book months and months out.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Great Sand Dunes National Park is ABSOLUTELY a MUST SEE. There is nowhere else like it in the US. People who are unimpressed haven't made the trek to the top of High Dune. Half our party stopped after the first couple dunes and their reaction was, ""It was cool."" The remainder who made the effort to make it to the top thought it was the highlight of our 10 day Colorado trip that included white-water rafting, ATVing, hiking to several waterfalls, driving to the top of Pikes Peak on a day that included both brilliant sunshine AND a near-whiteout blizzard as well as touring the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs. We went at the end of May, 2017. The high temp was 82. Medano Creek was running and very interesting, too.  Don't sell yourself short if you come here. Make the trek to the top! If you're not in great shape, take your time and plenty of water. Oh, and rent one of the sand sleds! We got ours at Kristi's Sports in Alamosa, but you can rent them just outside the park, too, apparently.

A good place for photography....distance shots with the mountains in the background or closer shots showing the curves and ridges of the dunes. For the latter, it is best to hike a fair bit to the southwest before going into the dunes, to avoid most of the footprints and to find more interesting ridges in the dunes.","May 27, 2017",Nothing else like it in Colorado,1,"Austin, Texas",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,Recommendation was to go in the morning before the sand gets too hot from the sun. We followed this advice and were able to go barefoot the whole time. We were there for a few hours and we could feel the sand starting to heat up. Crossing the shallow stream was a nice way to cool off after the hiking. Climbing to the top of one of the highest peaks was not easy but the view made it worth it.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Located on the eastern edge of the San Luis Valley, the large Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve encompasses and protects a huge and diverse natural area. In fact, as the large and highest mountain valley, the San Luis Valley and the mountains and desert (the valley itself receives less than 9 inches a rain of year even though below the valley you would find vast oceans of water).The park contains the tallest sand dunes in North America, rising to a maximum height of 750 feet (229 m)[4] from the floor of the San Luis Valley on the western base of the Sangre de Cristo Range, covering about 19,000 acres (7,700 ha). Researchers say that the dunes started forming less than 440,000 years ago.The Great Sand Dunes National Park spans about 45,000 acres and the Preserve adds an additional 41,000 acres (about 132 square miles) for just over 86,000+ total, but, in order to protect the natural resources including the underground aquifers, the Federal and State governments have purchased large adjoining or close tracts of land. South of Moffat and north of 160, most of the land east of State Highway 17 is government owned and I do not think it is due to the UFO observatory west of 160.The primary feature from which the National Park's name originated, are the dunes, which consume about 20,000 acres. The dunes are the highest in all North America rising about 800 feet above the surrounding valley floor. Because you are walking on loose sand, you will swear the top of the dunes are 8,000 feet high.The dunes were formed from sand deposited by the Rio Grande and its tributaries, as well as other streams such as the ephemeral Medano Creek, which provides cool recreational opportunities during late springs and early summer. Sand carried by westerly winds were deposited in the area as the wind slowed before crossing the Sangre de Cristo Range, The dunes are not static but instead expand and change daily.Remembering that the dunes only cover a small fraction of the public land, the area has a lot to offer and many opportunities for adventure including:1. Medano Creek, a seasonal creek, provides beach-like recreation,2. Dunes exploring, hiking, running and sandboarding3. Camping in the many terrific campground,4. Backpacking in the rugged mountains around the sand dunes,5. Fishing in the many lakes and rivers,6. Hunting throughout most of the area7. Sand Dunes Pool which provides a very relaxing experience8. Zapata files are further south on BLM land with lots of good camping spots and9. Much more.I have attached some photographs of each of these so you can see.There are lots of camping spots in and around the National Park, but you need to make reservations during busy times. There are hotel rooms and cabins throughout the San Luis Valley, but Alamosa offers the most options, along with numerous restaurants. The park is easy to reach from US HWY 160 and 285, and State Highway 17.Have a great time!","May 26, 2017",A great experience at the GREAT SAND DUNES NATIONAL PARK AND PRESERVE,482,"Pemba, Mozambique",5

Didn't realize to access the dunes you need to cross a cold (but not unbearable) stream. We had water sandals which worked just fine. Would recommend that you stop at the visitor center and watch the video which gives you a good overview of the area, how the sand/dunes are formed, and how the dunes look at different times of the year.

If you ever spend a Spring in the San Luis Valley, the high winds will allow you to understand very quickly how the Sand Dunes came to be, but for those of you who are just visiting and looking for a day, or weekend, of fun and adventure, you have to check out the Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve! From the cool waters of the 'disappearing' river to the top of the hot, golden dunes, this place is one you must see to believe! As someone who lives in the Valley and has seen the dunes many times, I am still awestruck when standing beneath these towering masses that nature has slowly created over time; a sandy, beach-like oasis IN the mountains of Colorado? Yes! -You can stand in the cool river while squishing your toes in the softest sand, and admire the majesty of the dunes AND the breathtaking snow-capped mountains behind and all around this glorious national park! -Dogs are allowed, on leash at all times, and be sure to bring poo bags for them!-Don't forget to pack sunscreen!-Flip-flops are a major drag if you plan on climbing the dunes; wear sandals or sneakers or hiking boots and just deal with the sand getting in them. If you wear flip flops, you will have to deal with them ""flopping"" sand into the back of your shorts and hair the whole way up, they have a tendency to make climbing harder, and they often break due to the heat and sinking and stretching of the sand. -Trust me on this. -If you're taking your pup to climb the dunes, remember, if the sand is too hot for your feet, it's too hot for their paws! -Bring shoes for them or leave them on the beach with a friend or leave them at home.-Be sure to bring plenty of water! -The machines at the dunes are often sold out, and even when in stock, they offer luke warm beverages at best! -Freezing bottles of water and letting them thaw in the cooler is the best route to go at the dunes!-Bring sand boards, sand castle molds, shovels, Frisbees, etc! -DO bring a trash bag to haul your trash out with you! (please and thank you!)-DO NOT litter or leave cigarette butts or dog poo behind in our beautiful park!-Be warned that if you venture off and leave your picnic unguarded, the crows will go through your stuff and have themselves a makeshift picnic; no, I'm not joking.-Always, always, ALWAYS call ahead to see if the campground is full before making the trip to camp at the dunes; it fills up and stays full most of the spring and summer!-The 'conveniences' at the local store are very pricey, so come prepared with all of the necessities or be prepared to shell out some monies! -This is a VERY important one, so pay attention: DO NOT GO VENTURING OFF BY YOURSELF!!! DO NOT TRY TO FOLLOW THE RIVER AS FAR SOUTH AS IT WILL GO!!! DO NOT CLIMB THE DUNES RIGHT BEFORE SUNSET WITHOUT A COMPASS OR A LOCAL CLIMBER!! DO NOT CLIMB THE DUNES NEAR SUNSET WITHOUT PROPER ATTIRE AND A HEAVY JACKET!!! -Treat the Dunes as a desert; once the sun goes down, expect very very low temperatures! We have had several people get lost at the dunes while climbing by themselves and they have become very disoriented. -Keep an eye on your children at all times; yes, the park is safe, however it is full of potential dangers; snakes and spiders, extreme sun exposure, dehydration, sunburn, etc! Reapply sunscreen every hour or so, especially if they are playing in the water. Yeah, I think that pretty much covers it!

You can go on a hike to see water falls or cross the river and climb the dunes. If you climb the dunes be sure to take a plastic snow sled with you and a can of cooking spray. Spraying the sled lets you have a fun ride down the steep sections of the dunes (and thus re-enacting a scene from Star Wars Episode 7). Expect to get sand everywhere. It's totally worth it. The group camp grounds were nicely maintained. I did not expect to have flushing toilets and running water. Be sure to bring a towel since there are no hand dryers.

I have never seen such massive sand dunes, there are several heights you can climb the tallest peak is 755 feet from base to crest. you may have to cross a creek with water and it comes off the mountain snow so it will be cold. you will reach the bottom of the dunes and now it takes good condition to climb these we did the first peak and were pooped. You can climb with shoes or with out ( we did it with out),short or pants depending on the time of year, take water (very important), if it is windy the sand will kick up and blowing sand hurts so make sure you have a bandanna in case you need to cover your face. It is really a lot of fun to run back down the dunes, its like being on the moon you can jump and land in the sand. Listen to the rangers in the visitor center, they are very knowledgeable and very friendly. Hope you enjoy it as much as we did !!!","April 9, 2017",Sand hiking is tough,1,"Cedar Park, Texas",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"You can spend an hour or half a day here, that's the nice thing about this place. It is a minimal charge to get in, I think it was $5. There is a very nice visitors center upon arrival, it has restrooms, a short movie to watch and many hands on activities. There is a wonderful place out back to get a large span photo shot of the Dunes. After the visitors center head to the dunes. Make sure you pack water and sandals, you can plan on your feet getting wet when you have to cross the creek to get to the dunes. If you want to slide down the dunes, I would suggest renting a sled from the visitor center. Regular sleds DO NOT work as there is too much friction with the sand. There is alot of territory to cover if you're going to climb all the way to the top, good luck!","April 5, 2017",Fun day activity,53,"Denver, Colorado",4
Great Sand Dunes National Park,We went to the visitors center first and then to the dunes. You have to cross a very wide and shallow river before reaching the dunes. If you visit any time other than the summer (the sand gets very hot during the day) I would advise going without your shoes. Running and playing in the sand is much more fun barefoot. I saw many people carrying their shoes and some commented that they should have left them behind.,"April 5, 2017",One of a kind experience,33,"Longmont, Colorado",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This park is so much fun. I had no idea they would let you slide down the dunes on sleds, but if you forgot to bring yours just go to the local Walmart and buy one. The park is beautiful, fun, and relaxing. Just don't forget your sunblock and beware of hot sand in the summer. Also, know that there is a watery/sandy area to walk through before you get to the dunes so you need appropriate shoes to deal with that (or no shoes if you prefer).","April 2, 2017",Bring a sled & put sunblock on (don't forget your feet),16,"Denver, Colorado",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,We stopped here as a side trip on the way back to Denver from Taos so we only had a couple hours to explore but would have loved to have spent more time. After a brief stop in the visitor center we hit the dunes. There are no trails as the sand is constantly shifting so you just pick a point and head towards it. It is one of those places i toiugh to judge the scale of until you are actually walking on the dunes. Unlike some of the other dunes we have explored there is virtually no vegetation. Hiking uphill in the sand takes considerable effort as you tend to slide back quite a bit and we found some areas where the footing was a little more firm. Once we got up to the summit of the dune we had picked as our destination we started back down. This was loads of fun as you can jump/slide and run down steep sand slopes. Definitely worth seeing and I wish we could have made a day of it instead of a couple hours.,"April 2, 2017",Truly Amazing Dunes,55,"Oxford, Ohio",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Like no other place - really interesting climate, environment/geography. We watched the 15 minute video in the visitors center which I highly recommend - then rented sand sleds to play on the dunes. Too much fun, the dunes are a lot higher when you are climbing up them and are quite the workout. Protip...keep your mouth closed when sledding. We were there at the end of March so it wasn't so hot....on a hot day...this place could be like an oven. We had a blast - if you haven't been you should.","April 2, 2017",Its a pretty amazing place,4,,5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This is truly a unique geological creation. I don't think I will ever see anything quite like it again. The sand dunes are in the foreground of gorgeous mountain peaks and forests which creates an amazing contrast with the dunes. We had to pass Medano creek to reach the dunes and while it is somewhat shallow due to the time of season, it was icy. As a result, our feet were freezing going to and from the dunes. Luckily, we brought extra shoes. ","April 1, 2017",Absolutely Breathtaking,11,"Columbus, Georgia",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"My family loves sand dunes and spent a lot of time at the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in the Midwest. These dunes makes those dunes seem like a joke! We rented sand sleds at Kristi Mountain Sports in Alamosa and then waded across the Medano Creek to have an exhilarating day climbing and sledding dunes surrounded by gorgeous mountains on all sides. It was not busy at all and we were able to bring our dog. He's only a little guy, but he was able to hike the dunes unassisted. I highly recommend trying sand sledding; it looks scary, but it is really not. We will definitely come back again! I just wish there was somewhere pet-friendly to stay closer to the dunes. The campgrounds were not open yet, but maybe we'll try that next time instead of the mediocre hotel in Alamosa.","March 26, 2017","Wow, Beautiful and Exhilarating!",39,"Chicago, Illinois",5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,This is one of the most unique places I've ever been to! It's a bit of a drive (2.5 hrs from Colorado springs) but it's completely worth it and can be done in a day. Prepare for the conditions - it's usually windy there so cover up head to toe because the sand hurts when it hits your bare skin. A buff is recommend as well as googles!! If you don't have goggles wear sunglasses to protect your eyes!! It's not a great place to go in the summer unless you go early morning or late evening because the sand can get extremely hot!! Between April and June there's a fun river to play in!! Sand Sledding is the best and you should definitely do it!! Regular snow sleds do not work - even with wax. There's a place just outside the park that rents sand sleds (though they may be closed during winter) - Though we found a Snowboard works perfectly! Add a bit of wax and you're good to go!!

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We made a side trip to visit the Great Sand Dunes national Park, and it was worth it. The dunes are so big, I have never seen anything like them. They can be seen from miles away. I did a little research before visiting them, and as novice geological buff, they are fascinating in how they were formed. Near the parking lot and visitor center, the river runs and is a nice cool mountain stream during the summer. Locals said the river varies in current according to the season, but it sounds like it never is high and swift, and always passable. When we were there, it was maybe an inch in depth. If you are going to be on the dunes, you need to watch the weather. Lighting strikes happen, and I am sure people have been struck by lighting while on the dunes. So be careful when any storms are near. To have a good time in the summer, I recommend arriving early in the morning, while it is cool, as the sand heats up, and by late morning, it gets uncomfortably hot because of the sun. When we were there, the temperatures were in the 60's, but the sand was hot. Take water to stay hydrated in the altitude and dry air. And be ready to hike. If you want to hike to the highest point nearest the visitor center, you are looking at a climb of around a mile (I am guessing) up hill in sand, so it is a work out to get to the top! If you are ready to do some real hiking, there are lots of trails around, but you can also hike for many miles through the dunes, but you need to be ready for a good work out going up and down sand dunes at the altitudes. We had three of our kids with us, all teens, and they wanted to go sand boarding. I would recommend going to Alamosa to rent a sand board. We went to Kristi mountain sports to rent one for about $18. They give you a few instructions and send you on your way. However, we were visiting in the Summer, and the sand gets hot. You need to plan to be done by around noon to 1:00 as a result. For us and our kids, between the hike, and the heat, we really only spent about 2 hours there because we got there to late in the morning to enjoy the cool sand. It was uncomfortable. No doubt, in the earlier part of the day, it would have been must more enjoyable for us. When we left, our initial impression was that we were very happy to have gone to see it, but if we never came back, it would be OK. Now that I have had a chance to think about it, I would go back to visit for a longer period of time during a cooler part of the year.","February 11, 2017",One of a kind place to visit,18,"Fort Worth, Texas, United States",4

The weather was perfect as it was cooler, but once you start walking up the hills and are in direct sunlight, it warms up quickly. I cannot imagine doing this in the summer. We rented a sand board and sled. It was a lot harder than anticipated, even though we are very active people. Note: The farther you sled down, the steeper the incline walking up.

I had no idea this park existed. I had visited Colorado since I was a child and didn't even know it was there. One could easily imagine you were in the middle east facing a sea of sand dunes. Camping facilities were available but closed for the season, but looks like fun. In spite of the cold weather, some guests work ski clothes and slid down the dunes. My daughter kind of resented the intrusion into her solitude, but each to their own. I didn't make it up onto the dunes with a gimpy leg and no accommodations were made for handicapped access that we could see this time of the year.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"I like visiting the national parks as each offers something different. Approaching the park, it didn't look like much time would be needed to see the park. There are sand dunes at the foot of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The visitor center is worth a stop, but the main attraction are the dunes which are accessed from the dunes parking lot which is a short drive from the visitor center. Medano creek was dry, but there was a darker area in the sand that indicated where the creek runs. It's a bit of a flat walk (more than a football field) before the start of the dunes. Moving from one dune to the next. you need to go down before you can go up again. It's like walking on a beach, only uphill, so you are not making the same forward progress with each step. In late September, the sand was a little warm and comfortable to sit on while enjoying the scenery from the dunes. It was a sunny day, but not too hot that you could not make it to the top of the first dune in mid-day temperatures provided you allowed yourself enough time. The dunes are large with no trails so even while there are a number of other people there, you get the feeling of being more isolated. Even though you may not be able to go to the top, seeing the dunes while being in the dunes provides a much different perspective then seeing them on flat land. Your effort will be rewarded and you will get a feeling of serenity and smallness amidst the large dunes. I wish I would have allowed more time for the visit and stayed later at night to be able to see all the stars in the sky that I have heard are impressive due to limited light pollution.","December 24, 2016",Serene setting,37,"Bentonville, Arkansas",5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"There is the ""Medano Pass Primitive Road"", an about 11 mile road that took us about two hours to cross, plus another hour or so to reach US 160, on our way to Taos. We drove a Toyota 4Runner that was powerful and high enough to handle this road. Even though the standard recommendation is to lower tire pressure through soft-sand spots, this was not an option for us because we did not carry an air-pump. A very helpful Park Ranger suggested that I should drive a bit fast on those tricky but short stretches, and we crossed them fine. The rest of the road, which reaches 10,000 feet elevation, was one of the most fun/adventurous drives that we have ever made. We constantly had to set the highest 4WD option and drive 5mph or slower, but the views and experiences were just fantastic. If everything goes well, then this is not-to-miss. If a car breakdown, then it's long walk back to the Visitors Center - we did not find any car coming or going on Nov-01-16.

When you turn off the highway to goto the park entrance there is a pretty cool looking grotto off to the right of the road. after you park and make your way to the Dunes themselves there is a shallow creek running through the sand (only in early summer, it dries up later in the season). It is quite the hike to get to the actual Dunes. Climbing up them is no small feet. Its like hiking a mountain except on these dunes, your feet sink into the sand and you slide down a tiny bit with each step. So, being in decent shape is required to hike multiple dunes.

You can find areas on the lee side of dunes where it's slightly consolidated and easier to climb. The visitor center warns that winds get pretty brisk at times and that's for sure. Barely blowing when I started but at the top now more than than 25 ++. So think of taking a duff or scarf to cover up in case. I could have used goggles! :) I would love to return during the summer with my kids and let them try the sand boards which can be rented at the lodge when open.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"In essence, it a giant pile of sand. It's big. It's tall (over 700 feet). You can pretty much go wherever you want on the dunes. Did I mention it was big? It's very impressive to look at. It's actually very hard to walk on. Going uphill on the sand dunes is hard work -- much harder than on a dirt trail. For every step you take up, the soft sand pushes you back half a step because it's so soft. Once you get up to a hill though, the view is very nice. In the summer, the sand can get really hot so be careful. We were there in the fall. The creek is bone dry, but the sand was cool. The sand is very fine. It felt warm on the surface (not hot) on the day we went but if you dig down a couple of inches, it feels very cool to the touch. Make sure you bring lots of water and pace yourself. It's fun just to sit on the sand and watch the scenery. You can also rent a sand surfboard and go sand surfing. Just keep in mind you have to walk it back up the hill after you are done :-). There is plenty of room for everyone since there are no trails and you can pretty much go where ever you want.There really isn't much else at this national park except the sand dunes.

This day we drove almost 7 hours and our daughter was so excited to pickup her JR Ranger packet and borrow the official backpack. The Ranger tried to discourage her from borrowing the backpack because ""you don't get anything special with it""We've been fortunate enough to almost always get amazing rangers so, we were overdue for a less than ideal experience.

Each had its own particular characteristic, but Great Sand Dunes was certainly one of a kind. Seeing the visitors clamor over the dunes towering high above the valley floor, provided a reminder of how minuscule man can be in nature’s world. The dunes built by a confluence of winds blowing across the desert floor and off the mountains are made of soft sand as high as 750 feet ... the highest sand dunes in North America. They just seem so strange, piled up next to the Sangre de Cristo mountain range, and near a flatten valley. We visited in October and the streams that surround the dunes in much of the year were dry and the normally snow capped mountains were still minus their white caps. However, there were not crowds of people there, giving at least some semblance of serenity while visiting a natural wonder.

We so enjoyed staying at Great Sand Dune Lodge nearby... a comfortable, clean and convenient place to stay during our three-day exploration. if you have time, study the Medano Creek bed and validate the symbiosis of the water and the sand...fascinating! Nearby Zapata Falls are also a worthy trek...great pics, too. Just a wonderful national park to explore and enjoy.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"So unexpected to find something so beautifully different from the surrounding mountains. Spent an hour and a half walking the dunes. Planning to return again. Camping inside the park requires reservations. We camped in the area above, the park preserve. Off-road capable vehicle needed to get up the mountain on preserve part of the park!! That is beautiful, too, at an elevation of 9,400 ft.: aspen tree forest, deer, mountain goats, bear, turkey, wild flowers! Zapata Falls is too close to skip and beautiful. You get a view of the dunes on the 20 minute hike to and from the falls.","October 21, 2016",This is in Colorado? YES,5,,5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"The dunes are mesmerizing, and challenging if you want to hike them seriously! Being a senior I had to pace myself carefully, but it was well worth it. We used hiking boots and poles. Highly recommended! I would have been hard pressed to do it without the poles. We also brought water and snacks which served us well over the four hours we hiked.

I wish we had more time to explore, but just stopping and walking around for a hour was well worth the trip off the main road. this was so kool to see. we were there in the fall so there was no water. someday I would like to go back.I have never seen sand dunes like this before","October 19, 2016",must see,19,"Nottingham, Pennsylvania",4

It is amazing how the sand dune formed.We decided to take the four wheel drive road. It was a great ride going from the dunes to the alpine biosphere. Saw lots of deer and Rocky Mountain Sheep.Make sure you ask a ranger if the road is opened before taking off.When you leave the park boundaries keep going straight. You will come out in Red Wing. It will take about two hours.,"October 17, 2016",Take the four wheel drive road!,12,"ellijay, ga",5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Had a great fun time. We hired a sand sledge from a shop in Alamosa and it was well worth the $18 – so much fun! We stopped at the Visitor Centre first and the views of the sand dunes were amazing. Just a little way further down the road is the parking for the sand dunes which are about ½ mile walk from the parking lot. It was hard work walking on the sand, even more so, hiking up the sand dunes to slide down but so much fun. But when people say sand will go everywhere, they mean everywhere!!! But I must admit though I did have a quite spectacular wipe out on the sand sled! Near the parking lot is a picnic area with flush toilet and changing facilities.","October 15, 2016",Amazing and such FUN,58,"London, UK",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,My family has talked about going here for awhile so we finally made the trip. The park is really in the middle of no where but the dunes are impressive. They are really quite beautiful. You can hike anywhere you want on the dunes. Getting up to the hire ridges will take about an hour and a half.

We were in the park for 2 hours total and were exhausted, 2 grandparents, mom and 9 year old. It was fun but difficult to walk up after you've sledded down! The dunes look like a picture, it's hard to believe they're real when you view them from the visitor center. Great time to visit, not hot and not crowded.You can just look at them and not walk into them. Some tough folks actually hiked to the top dune. They looked like dots on the landscape!

It is a very inviting Park, not filled with ""do nots"" but invitations to go out on the dunes and have a good time. The store rents sleds for sliding which I think kids would love. We rode through the campgrounds and were impressed by the sites-very well laid out and great views from some of them. It is a small Park but fun.","October 10, 2016",Inviting park,44,"Marietta, Georgia",3
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"I visited the national park with my wife and 2.5 year old. We had an amazing experience. The sand dunes provided by beautiful scenic photography opportunities. We had rented a board from the oasis shop before entry into the national park. Board cost was around $21 including tax for a 24 hour rental. The park entry was $15 and valid for 7 days. We entered the park around 4:00 pm. The park is part of the national park network and if you have the $80 annual America the beautiful pass you can use it here. After we entered the park we stopped by the visitor center. I knocked down 0.5 points in my rating due to the cold reception at the visitor center. When I asked for details the women at the reception just told me to use the map with no additional details. The park would be better served by hiring people who are more passionate about their job. We then proceeded to the sand dunes, parked at the entrance and made our way in. We had assumed the sand dunes would be near where we parked our car but it is a good 0.5 mile walk from the parking lot to the start of the dunes. I knocked down 0.5 points in my rating due to this bringing my overall rating to a 4 out of 5. Once we got to the dunes it was really amazing and we had a blast sliding down the dunes. Walking through the dunes is extremely tiring and we made it across two of them but could see people climbing across many more dunes to greater and greater heights. We were tired after 2 hours and made our way back through the 0.5 miles to the parking lot. On the way out I saw a couple of deers and took some photographs. Overall a very enjoyable experience albeit a bit tiring and wonderful photo opportunities. ","October 7, 2016",Amazing but extremely tiring,21,U.S,4
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"I knew before I exited I-25 and headed west into the San Juans, that the winds not his particular day would prohibit a pleasant hike through the dunes.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,A backdrop of beautiful Colorado mountains is the last place you would expect sand dunes. I have been going to Colorado for years but never took the time to visit the Great Sand Dunes. Wow! They are huge.....and deceiving! You drive out to the dunes parking area and start your trek. Sometimes there is a creek with flowing water. The kids love it. Can you say mud pies? But as you are walking in this area the sand is nice and packed. The further you go. The looser the sand gets...and the harder the walk...not today anything about your are going up in altitude. You get to the top of one and you either walk down through the bowl or take the long way around the edge to start the next one. We went all the way to the top!!! (Of the first dune!) in August it gets very hot on the dunes. Wear shoes!! Take water and enjoy this unique phenomenon.,"October 5, 2016",Awesome wonder,58,"Forney, Texas",4

When your done on the dunes, there is a small creek that you can dip your feet in or play in the water. Beautiful seeing the flat grasslands, then the dunes and then the mountains. Kids did the Junior Ranger activity. After they complete their Junior Ranger activities, for a $1 donation to their special sand wheelchair program, the kids received both their badge and patch. The rangers were really nice and helpful.","October 5, 2016",Sliding on the sand was fun,130,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",4

If you go, you must climb at least part of a dune to give you an idea of how huge they really are. Dogs are actually allowed, which is great because our dogs loved it. We didn't bring sleds to sled down the dunes but it seems that would be fun to do. Definitely worth the stop if you're in the area. ","September 30, 2016",Nice stop,49,"Chillicothe, Ohio",4

HA I was beautiful. we each had a dog with us the Malamute loved it, my Britney had fun but hated the sand in his fur. i had to bathe him after. You just need to carry a doggie clean up bag and leash, the views are stunning and ever changing. My second trip was in August and i stayed in the creek with the Britney while my 2 sons and husband took the malamute halfway up. It was a much warmer day and I dont think we brought water bottles. we did not tour the museum which was to bad. still very beautiful.","September 30, 2016",All day fun in the sun,5,,5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"The Great Sand Dunes National Park is a must see, do not miss this adventure. We camped for 5 nights at the campground inside the park. I will do a separate review for the campground, but in short it was a nice campground. Check out my review on Pinyon Flats Campground. The sand dunes are fabulous, we hiked up them one day and hiked in the forest a few other times. I am a photographer and just love all the different ways to capture the dunes and its surroundings. You have the dunes on one side and mountains on 2 sides with high desert open lands on the other side. There is also National Wildlife Refuges and other wetlands not too far from the park. And Zapata falls just a few miles from the park. We did not go to the falls because the roads were rough, if we had a higher clearance vehicle we would have. There is also primitive camping for those with a high clearance vehicle in the park as well.There is several deer who walk through the campground every morning and night, they are fairly tame and basically own the place. Also lots of birds, I even seen a couple lizards and rabbits. We did not see any bear or mountain lions but they do live there too. I have traveled a decent amount in the US and The Great Sand Dunes is on my top 5 list easy. I was surprised it was a desert, I just never thought of Colorado having a desert. But it is a high desert. The open skies are amazing. On a clear night you can see the milky way easy and we were fascinated by how low the Big Dipper appeared to us. I took a few stare trail photography shots late at night. Be aware of possible strong winds if you are not camping in the tree lines. For nature lovers this is the place to be. Since we went in early September there were no mosquitoes to bother us, but plenty of fleas since horses are allowed on some of the trails.","September 30, 2016",Wow Spectacular Place,19,"Tucson, Arizona",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This is a small, unique and lovely park. I really enjoyed the views and a short hike on the Dunes. You can hike to the top of the Dunes and gain about 750 feet.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"I've been to the Michigan dunes, and the ones at the Outer Banks, but these rank number one. We were with a photo club and took lots of pictures, especially in the afternoon when the sun was lower to create shadows. There's a place right before the entrance where you can rent boards to surf down the sand, and an excellent restaurant for either before or after you visit the park. The restaurant was very handy because there's nothing else around here for miles. Cute little gift shop in there, too. If you're planning to climb, give yourselves 2 - 3 hours. It's a long way up.","September 27, 2016",Awesome dunes.,7,"Atlanta, Georgia, United States",5

The dunes are a surprising and spectacular sight. Imagine it's blistering hot in summer and hiking to the top of the ridge from the Dunes parking lot would require at least an hour or more for the fit. Hiking in sand is a challenge! Unlike other parks the Dunes are pretty much the attraction but there were more viewing and hiking options we didn't have time to see.

We had a fun time hiking up the immense dunes and enjoying the views from the top. The size of the sand dunes is unbelievable. You have to see this place to believe it. We also returned later in the evening for a ranger talk in the amphitheater. Ranger Patrick did a good job singing and talking about the night sky. This is a very good place to look at the night sky which was incredible. If you really want to have unique fun rent a sand board from the local market. Bring water when you hike.,"September 25, 2016","Fantastic, Fun Park",58,Baltimore,5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This was a cool, unique site to see. According to my Geologist husband, ""It's a sediment trap""! The way the mountains are shaped in this area helps create the sediment trap, which causes 100's of feet tall sand dunes. We visited in late May/early June, and the water from the stream you must walk across to the dunes was very cold (late afternoon, early evening time). I recommend water shoes/rain boots. It was a workout walking up the sand dunes!

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Honestly stopped here just to tick it off my list of National Parks, but was surprised at it's size and quirky beauty. We 'hiked' up a couple levels of the dunes but did not attempt to reach the top. These dunes are huge!There were a couple school buses of middle school kids there. They seemed to be enjoying themselves playing in the creek/sand.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This is a great stop for a few days if you're touring around Colorado. The dunes really are amazing, and it's kind of nice because the park isn't nearly as busy as some of the others. They have a campground, and you can also do some backpacking out to primitive camping areas.Their is a road through the park that actually goes up over the Medano Pass in the Sangre De Cristo Mountains, but you will need a good 4 wheel drive and ground clearance.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Wow! I am glad I made an effort to see this special place. I saw a tv show on Colorado National Parks that described these sand dunes and I knew I had to come here. It did not disappoint. The park is somewhat out of the way, about 18 miles off the main road, Colorado 160. Don't let that dissuade you. Go see this natural wonder. The visitor center is well staffed to help guide you during your visit. Following a stop at the visitor center, you can walk out to see the dunes up close and personnel. If you are up to it, hike out and stand on the dunes. It is eerily quite and peaceful. I may never have the opportunity to come back but this will be an experience I will always remember. The simple words here can not adequately describe this very special place. You must see it to experience it for yourself.","September 19, 2016",I can now cross this off my bucket list,46,"Valdosta, Georgia",5

The dunes are massive and can be viewed from the visitors center as well as from the parking lot at the base. I elected to attempt to walk up as far as I could. It can be a strenuous climb as your feet sink into the sand on the steep climb, and it takes time. You will be rewarded with great views however. I did not make it to the top of the closest dune due to strong winds sandblasting my face.I would highly recommend spending a few hours here.

We went thinking it was going to be a beach or something. From a distance, it looked like a descent pile of sand, but the GPS said we were still 10 miles away.....When we got there we were stunned. We just didn't expect mountains of sand! We got there as the sun was going down and that made it that much cooler. If you are in the area, you have to see it to believe it. You will get permanent sand in your shoes, so take them off before you get out of the car!

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We visited this National Park for the very first time over Labor Day weekend. As an area resident and National Park fan, it was high time to go! We lucked out with the weather. The gate is $15/car, valid for 7 days. Our first day in the park, the temperatures stayed around 75 and recent rains helped to keep the sand dunes comfortable. The warnings at the entrance to the dunes remind visitors that the sand may reach temperatures up to 150 degrees and that shoes (not sandals) are a safety requirement. The paws of animals are also at risk on most days. But our trip was special - we were comfortable bare foot in the sand as were most of the visitors that day. The second day, we went deeper into the park. So much of the area is beyond the visitor's center and the dune field. If you are a camper, I suggest you check out the NPS.Gov site for back country sites: Some are on the dunes, others around the waterways and lakes. The VERY BEST part of our trip was renting a jeep and taking the Medano Pass Primitive Road. We drove through water crossings and rocky passes and saw fields of flowers, woodlands and of course, views of the dunes. We were out for four hours round trip and did not have time to take the entire trail. We will be back to do this again.On the third day, we hiked the trail and the creek to see Zapada falls. This is not a park site but located just a few miles south. Warning!!! The road to the falls is rocky and rough! It is a short, 1/2 mile from the upper parking lot but the climb is steep. Strategically located benches along the climb were welcome for us. To see the falls, the hiker must wade through the creek, the bottom of which is covered with rocks - not sand - to a cave to see the falls. We noticed experienced people arrived wearing hiking gear but changed into water socks/shoes before getting into the creek for the last leg of the trail. Due to the changes in the seasons, I am sure this is an ever changing sight to see.Take your time here. Breathe. Sit or climb. Relax and observe the plants, animals, sunsets, sunrises, and people. This is a place to recharge.","September 11, 2016",More than just a big pile of sand,26,ASSARIA,4

As you approach they look like they might not be very large, distance can be deceiving with nothing to gauge with. At the parking lot look at the dunes, the small specks at the top are people. It is difficult to walk in sand so be prepared. Bring water. There is a small snack bar just outside the park, it is the nearest place to eat.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Wanting to take Billy the Border Collie to the sand dunes while camping in nearby Cuchara - we hit the sand dunes on Labor Day. Man - a lot of people had the same idea. The place was packed. The parking for the dunes was backed way past the parking lot and the visitor center was packed. We did however go just past the parking for the sand dunes just across from the camping area where there is a gravel parking lot. We parked there - hardly any cars, and walked to the dunes. It was a short easy walk, even looked closer than at the dunes parking lot, and we didn't have any of the crowds to deal with.The dunes were incredible. Who'd think it'd be that quiet out there but yet your voice can carry way far away. As for Billy the Border Collie - he loved it. I ran like a maniac through the dunes.

You can hike all over the dunes and to the top. Local places rent sand boards that you can slide down the hills on...just like sledding and snow boarding. We came in early September on an absolutely gorgeous and cool day. I imagine this would not be fun in the heat of the summer. Highly recommend Great Sand Dunes. If you are in Colorado, it is a must.

Be aware that this place is pretty busy so plan accordingly. Views are amazing, if you go to the visitor center, the rangers will fill you in on history and what to do in case of severe weather. There is no shower at this location but they do provided restroom facilities with a place to wash of the sand of your legs.

The views are just spectacular. Our son & daughter-in-law got up early the next morning & hiked all the way to the top of the Dunes & loved it!

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This was the most unexpected sight to see in the mountains of Colorado. However, it was stunning scenery with very friendly mosquitos! It was much bigger than I expected. It was also a very popular place for locals to go on a weekend as there were plenty of sand boarders as well as hikers. At the creek there were a lot of families with small children. If attempting to walk up the dunes, I would recommend taking a lot of fluids as well as mosquito repellent. Allow yourself plenty of time to get there as it is quite a walk just to get to the base. The Visitor Centre has a lot of information and is worth a visit just for that. The gift shop offered many items as well as advice on walking trails in the NP. Outside the centre on the balcony there are further areas of information and some great views. If intending to walk up, early morning would be better.","August 25, 2016",Stunning scenery one would never expect in Colorado,62,"Perth, Australia",4
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"The Great Sand Dunes is an excellent attraction for families and thrill seekers. The towering dunes rise as high as 700' above the plain where they rest against the Sangre De Cristo mountains. Avoid walking on the dunes in the middle of the day, it becomes unbearably hot during the summer. Hiking in the dunes is amazing, it is slow going especially walk up hill. However, those brave enough to hike up to high dune are rewarded for their efforts by incredible views of the vast expanse of the dunes. Those determined to get a true sand dunes experience can stop by in the visitor center and obtain a back country pass which will allow them to camp on the dunes. I highly recommend this experience.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"A neat view from a distance, but once we passed the Visitor's Center we were eaten up by mosquitos. They swarmed the car by the hundreds. We could not walk out on the Dunes because of this. We were out of the car about 8 minutes & received multiple bites. We went back to the Visitor's Center & they were out of insect repellant. I asked the ranger at the Visitor's Center why they didn't tell us that we needed insect repellant at the entrance gate & he just laughed & said "" They don't bother you from here."" The little store restaurant outside the entrance gate was charging $9 a can, so make sure that you buy some prior to getting to the area. Interesting to read about how the sand dunes are formed at the Visitor's Center. You can rent sleds at the little store right outside the park entrance so that you can sleigh ride down the sand.

Remember this is all sand so be prepared with sunscreen, and shoes as the dry sand gets hot as the day goes on. We first stopped in the welcome center. Bathrooms, great view, educational and a small gift shop where we purchased the one year old a much needed big floppy junior ranger hat. We then drove around the bend to where you start. We choose to home base at the run offs edge. The run off is this wonderful streams of water therefore wet sand that the kids can walk and dig on. It is very low in August inch or two deep and 15 feet wide constantly running. ( it is river like in the spring) we had tents to get out of the sun if needed, snacks and sand toys.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Our family visited Great Sand Dunes National Park for 2 days in August. Shortly after entering the park on Hwy 150, you will see the sand dunes come into view. Stop at one of the pull outs on the road to take a panoramic picture. If you want to rent a sand sled, pull over at Oasis (convenience store & gas station), to pick one up. They are $20/calendar day. We hiked in the late afternoon our first day and took advantage of the late sun & shadows to take some pics. That evening, we were treated to a pink sunset behind the dunes as we watched from our campground at Pinyon Flats.The next morning, we packed up our tent and parked at the Sand Dunes Picnic Area and spent the morning wading in Medano Creek, which is barely ankle deep this time of year, and climbing High Dune, which I highly recommend. From the peak of High Dune, you have a fantastic view of the whole Dunes area. It was cool enough (70-ish?) to walk barefoot. But we had our closed toed shoes with us, just in case...We LOVED this area & I highly recommend, even if you just go for the day.","August 21, 2016",One of the Wonders of the Natural World!,11,"Liberty, Missouri",5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Sand dunes and you are not at the seaside or beach! Almost too unusual to understand how this can happen but a dried out sea bed and two conflicting winds have managed to create a minor environmental miracle - add two rivers that feed either side of the sand dunes and you have a wildlife mix that astonishes you when standing in the middle of the Colorado mountains! Only attempt climbing to the peak of you are fit and have two hours! This is the proverbial two steps forward one step back. Kids will love the boards you can rent from the Oasis store four miles prior to the park. Essential to take water, shoes for the potentially very hot sand 149 degrees max, and wind and sand protection like glasses and wind breaker.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This is a fascinating place -- Sahara sized sand dunes looming out of the scrubland, with a 14er (Blanca Peak) looming over you. We had teens with us, who all wanted to try the ""sand sledding"" they had read about. So we rented sand sleds at the Oasis (very reasonably priced; efficient, friendly service) and headed into the park. The hike up the dunes is not easy -- and we did it on a cool day with a breeze. Even for experienced hikers, the soft sand and altitude (7100ft base elevation) make it challenging. We also discovered that sand sledding is not quite the fun adventure we thought it would be. First, sand sleds are hard to control (our teens finally figured out that using your feet to slow their speed), and have a tendency to go sideways and flip. Second, they require wax to go over the sand, which wears off quickly (make sure you wax up and down and not across, as that dramatically slows you down). Third, while teens will naturally want to hike up to the high ridges, the ride down can be very fast -- we saw some spectacular wipeouts. Finally, remember that you will get sand everywhere when you sand-sled. Depending on how long your ride is after visiting the park, this can make it less comfortable than you had been expecting...All that said, it was an interesting place to see.","August 17, 2016","Fascinating Place, But Be Very Careful if Sand-Sledding",72,"Golden, Colorado",4

The park was unbelievably beautiful with its trees, creek and sand dunes all in one place. We sledded for over 3 hours and found ourselves covered in sand. It is definitely more messy than snow sledding! There is a creek that you have to cross to get to the sand dunes, so I recommend bringing beach shoes in a backpack but wearing sneakers and socks while sand sledding. We were there in August so the sands get really hot even with sandals on. My daughter had to put on socks with her sandals because it got too hot. Bring a ton of water with you because the walk is about ½ mile from the parking lot to the sand dunes and climbing them is a lot of hard work. It is a nice hike up the dunes and see the landscape. We stayed for the evening presentation about sand dunes and stargazing with their telescope. There happened to be a spectacular meteor shower that night so we had the most memorable time there.

This time in August still had water running in front of the dunes to hike thru. Maybe 3"" high at most in some areas. Loop 1 camping is for first come no reservations. Loop 2 is for reservations and loop 3 is for groups over 15. The whole campground was full when we were there. Because of the higher elevation the summer temperatures are in the 70's and 80's.

Hiking out on the dunes was like hiking on Tatooine but with the 14k Sangre De Christos as a back drop. We hiked on the dunes until sand in all our crevices drove us out. Then my kids dug a deep hole in the creek bed. They were a mess but had a blast. Camping was good but there were plentiful mosquitos in the evening and morning. But that is part of camping. Also, there is a camp store in the NP campground which actually has a better selection of food and supplies than the store right outside the gate.

If it's windy, you'll witness artistic natural designs in the surface which at sunset are worth every picture. Cool off in nearby creek and bring a picnic lunch/dinner and you're set.

Great photos from here. We decided to hike to the dunes, about 1.5 miles my husband says, to the dunes. We had read you should wear pants and shoes since the sand is very hot. We probably should not have hiked there since our 3 and 5 yr old boys were kind of beat by the time we go to the dunes. We weren't hot, but could have worn shorts and been fine since we didn't plan to sled the dunes. We had already been hiking for 7 days before we arrived, so they were already beat. We crossed the trickling stream and onto the dunes. We made it up the first dune or two before we turned back around. I didn't want to get stuck with my kids needing to be carried back. It's tough to walk in sand and we were glad we had our walking sticks. Would have been fun to sled, but not sure it's worth $20+ for a few times, especially with two tired kids. It was beautiful to see and I'm really glad we went. I really wish we could have gone back at night, but it was just way too late for our kids and an hour from our hotel. Mosquitos weren't bad for us. We used spray but didn't see too many on about July 9.

We took our Camlebaks for water and sand got all up in the mouth pieces when we fell off the sleds. But sand was all up in every thing so it didn't matter.

From a distance, these Florida residents thought, ""What are we going to see sand for?"" But when we actually got close, we were impressed! We went straight to the visitor center before going outside to walk toward the dunes. I say toward, because we didn't get too far. There were some hearty souls walking much farther than we would venture! The mosquitos near the base of the dunes, along the almost dried up creek were overpowering. Children and families were enjoying playing in the creek. Be prepared with bug repellant! We were there on a hot day and they say that the temperature on the sand dunes can get to 140 degrees. We decided to believe them and we viewed from a distance. The drive to the Great Sand Dunes National Park is beautiful and we took a different, even more beautiful drive back ending up in Pueblo, CO. There was a wildfire in the mountains that we could see from the road but it didn't affect our drive. We started out the day very early from our home at sea level in Florida and enjoyed beautiful scenery to and from this very interesting National Park.

After the snow melts in the spring, Medano Creek is created and families turn up to play at the ""beach"". When we visited it was more of a trickle than a creek but there were plenty of bugs - use insect repellent as we were severely bitten!

Be sure to rent a board to go sand boarding (about $18/ day). Rent them from in town. Walking in the sand is labor intense, so be prepared. The scenery is amazing.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We searched for places to visit for our family vacation. We came across the website for Great Sand Dunes National Park. We had no idea that there were sand dunes in Colorado, and they are the largest sand dunes in North America! When you see them from a distance they look like a large sand mass with the Sangre de Cristo mountains as a backdrop. Once you get to them they are massive! We rented boards to ""surf"" the sand at the Oasis Store which is near the park entrance. There were 4 of us-my husband and myself and our 2 kids ages 8 and 5. We rented a board for each of us. I would recommend not doing this if you have younger kids. They tired easily from carrying them up the dunes, and my husband and I wound up carrying them in addition to our own boards. Looking back we should have shared 2 boards. We also did not stay too long on the dunes because they got tired and hot. (Definitely go early) Luckily Medano Creek had not dried up yet and the kids got to cool off for a while. There were lots of mosquitoes near the parking area and entrance to the dunes. Also make sure to wear sunscreen. Wear a good shoe that you won't mind getting wet if you are going while Medano Creek still has water. Bring plenty of water too because it does get hot and tiring walking the dunes.","July 23, 2016",Had no idea this place existed!,56,"Lubbock, Texas",5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"This was our family's vote for most memorable thing we saw on our road trip from SC. Beautiful convergence of mountains, water, desert, sand. We initially parked in the main parking to go to the stream/base of sand and the mosquitos were too heavy for us--even being from the south. We drove back to the visitors center and bought bug spray, which did work. As we had already seen the crowds at the main parking area, we decided to park in the overflow parking. It was wide open--no crowds. The price you paid for this uncrowded spot was an approx. 11 minute hike down to the water and sand. It was worth it. Loved seeing the cacti on the way--scenic stroll to say the least. Very easy walk, which I did in hiking sandals and a skirt. At the end of our visit, I hiked back to the overflow parking while my husband and kids waded down to the main parking area, where I picked them up.

Today we decided to take a day trip and go to the park...wow! The park includes 44,246 acres and is adjacent to at least as much BLM and other protected lands. The Medano creek flow was low as we were well away from the peak snow melt but it was clearly interesting diversion on the way to the dunes. There were many folks of different hiking skills on the dunes...from those at the base to those on the low and medium peaks and then those that climbed to the top. The visitors center is well situated and has restrooms which are clean. There is a 20 minute video that talks to the parks origin and transition over time. We entered the 4 wheel drive road but about a mile and a half we ran into someone that found them self mired in sand up to their frame...all wheel drive is not 4x4!

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"I visited the Great Sand Dunes National Park when I was a kid back in 1966. I was 12, and not much of a fan of the outdoors (too many bugs). I'm so glad I got over that! (Well, there are still too many bugs sometimes! :-)) We hit the Dunes just when a summer thunderstorm blew in. As we ate lunch, we watched the sun illuminate some dunes while others were dark grey with cloudcover. It's hard to express how beautiful that was! A Rocky Mountain Bluebird and several hummingbirds helped us finish a lunch at the Great Sand Dunes Oasis, a great little hole-in-the-wall (and pretty much the _only_ hole-in-the-wall for miles around). The wind kicked up when we began our trek. We kept to the close side of the Dunes (you'll need rainboots or barefeet (or shoes you don't care if they get wet) to cross from the parking area to the Dunes. We found a great little trail through the cactus and brush that opened out into a great area where we were almost alone with the blowing sand and rippling water.I suspect on a hot day, that hike might yield some rattlesnakes, so you'll want to check if you can. I also suspect that if the wind isn't blowing, that the mosquitoes might carry you away. But I don't know that for sure.It's a hypnotic experience to walk through sand that blows over water. I've never seen anything like it. Very meditative and humbling.Highly recommended!LyP","July 19, 2016",Unique and spectacular!,18,"Seattle, Washington",5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"After experiencing the sand dunes at Kitty Hawk in the Outer Banks and the Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park in Utah, we knew that we did not want to miss any opportunity to experience the dunes at the Great Sand Dunes National Park when we visited Colorado this past week. Driving down the long road that approaches the park only wetted our appetite for the experience with beautiful views of the dunes and surrounding mountains. While we were there, we hiked the trail from the visitors center down to the dunes. Then, through the shallow creek and across the sand flats. Looking upwards, we saw others trudging up the ""Chilkoot Pass"" and decided we wanted to see the view from the top. We hiked up to one of the taller dunes with our 9 year old daughter. It was challenging but the view was incredible. After enjoying the view and catching our breath, we headed back down. My daughter completed all the activities needed to earn her Junior Ranger Badge. While everyone may not be fit enough to hike to the top of the dunes, there is defiantly a lot to see and do at this park for people of all ages and physical abilities.","July 11, 2016",Must See Natural Phenomena,8,"Marietta, Georgia",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"I took my kids in our AWD Toyota RAV4 for a day at the Dunes and they loved it. It costs about $15 but you have a week to enjoy the park. We got there at 1pm to the visitors center. We were on the hot dunes by 1:20pm. It was a beautiful site but bring good tennis shoes so you can enjoy the dunes more. I was wearing sandals which were filling with small rocks and hot sand. You can rent boards to surf the dunes for a fee. Don't bring your dogs as the sand is too hot for their paws; unless, you just want to avoid the dunes and stay in the creek. The creek is only about 2 -5 inches deep at most but is fairly cool water. There is a hiking trail closer to the visitors center but we did not check it out. When we left aroun 4pm the mosquitoes at the parking lot were swarming! The area is desolate but beautiful if you like mountains,etc. There is also great camp sites with bear proof trash cans. Plenty of deer tracks were noted in the sand and off road area. The elevation is around 6900-7500 feet and the dunes rise up about 700 feet. The wind is blowing at a pretty good pace so you are going to feel the prevailing winds blasting you with sand. Depending on where you are on the dunes you might feel the wind and sand more. The drive there and back was stunning along US 160.

Use high number suntan lotion5. Hike up at least one dune. It is quite strenuous hiking in the sand6. Wear a hat5. Go early in the summertime, at opening. During the day the sand can get as hot as 114 degree and, if it is a windy day, you will be sand whipped.6. Enjoy the movie and displays in the visitor center.7.

You can stop by for a short one-hour visit or spend the day climbing the dunes. If you're lucky, the water will be flowing at the entrance to the dunes from the parking lot. The water is only a few inches deep, but is very warm. Sometimes, small ripple waves come down the river when water breaks free from the sand farther upstream. A very cool phenomenon.The parking area, by the way, can be so thick with mosquitos in the summer you will wish you were wearing a suit of armor. Just quickly get out of your car and run for the sand. There aren't any mosquitos once you're on the dunes. Don't let the initial bug attack stop you from experiencing a unique adventure on the sand.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We spent the morning and early afternoon here and had a wonderful time. The sand dunes are magnificent -- you can't really grasp how immense they are until you're at the base and see how tiny all the climbers are on the dunes. We rented sand sleds from Oasis (a store and restaurant about five minutes before the park entrance); sledding was a total blast, although we all wound up covered head to toe in sand from our inevitable hilarious wipe-outs. The kids loved playing in the wet sand and shallow creek. The visitor center had many thoughtful and interesting exhibits explaining myriad facets of the park, from geology to history to biology. Strong recommendations: bring sun block and bug spray (the mosquitos were copious and vicious near vegetation), carry lots of water, go early (9:00 a.m. worked for us) before it gets too hot, and cheerfully accept that you'll be finding sand everywhere for a long time afterwards.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"I LOVE our National Parks! And Mom and I were excited to see the Great Sand Dunes. But there were a few things that made this our least favorite park we've been to. I will say that the Dunes are cool. The where, and why of this park is very interesting. But beyond that, Unless your looking to take a serious trek up through the sand dunes and/or do some sand boarding. Or your coming to bring the kids to the Medano creek. A picture of the Dunes would suffice. First off, Its Hot! Real hot and the sand is blistering! We read that you would want shoes, but I thought with both the creek and not wanting sand in my only pair of sneakers. I went with my sandals, and regretted it instantly! No joke, the sand is hot enough to BURN you like fire! Also the end of the walk from the parking lot, right before the Medano. There is a short steep part of the path. BEWARE! The heavy traffic from the creek makes it VERY dangerous! My Mom fell here, and thank God came away with only bruises. But someone could get very badly hurt here. Then there's the mosquitoes. They were MURDER around the creek! We were there for only as long as it took to ford through it. and I counted over 20 bites on my legs mostly. Just CRAZYl! Now when you put together seeing my beloved mother take a slam, Hot sun and Blistering hot sand burning my feet, and being TORE UP by mosquitoes!. Sand Dunes for us was pretty weak,... that being said, obviously people enjoy the heck outta this place. I would say if your like us, curious, but not sure if its worth going way out of your way.

Firstly, get an early start as the sand gets so hot, bring water (and they have a refilling station at the visitors center), sunscreen, bug spray and comfortable shoes (I had hiking sneakers but maybe hiking sandals might be best).The Medano creek was flowing at the base of the dunes though it was very shallow this time of year. This made for a good family-friendly playground and a shelter from the heat. We had to take off our shoes to cross the river as we headed to start our hike up the high dune.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We were driving from Santa Fe to Denver and didn't want the I-25 experience for 6 hours so detoured on the side roads up through Taos and to Ft Garland CO and thence to this NP. What a delight. You haven't seen anything like this in the US. Massive sand dunes backed up to the majestic Sangre de Christo mountains. The tallest dune is 750' and the visitors' center has a great film and an even better animated display that describes how this all came about. From the back deck of the center, you can watch ant-sized people attempting to climb to the top. Kids know enough just to play around in the sand. Warm weather warning: probably best to plan a spring trip, as when the streams dry up the mosquitos multiply, the sand gets really hot, and most of the enjoyment is visual - though the view is worth the trip.","June 27, 2016","Little known National Park deserves attention, visitors",386,"Tucson, Arizona",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"On Sunday, June 26th, 2016 we arrived about 9:30am after spending 15 minutes tied up in cow traffic. We literally drove a walking speed for more than half a mile with atvs and trucks herding cattle up the only road towards the park. I was concerned about lots of visitors on a Sunday, and we were third in line to pay the $15/car admission, but the line was 15 cars deep when we left at 11:15. We stopped at the visitors center, checked out the plumbing, took a quick walk around and asked a ranger about walking down or driving down to the river. I asked if the water was 33 degrees from the snowmelt and he said that it was in the 70's!A quick walk through Mosquitos between the car and the river and the water felt so warm, and no more bugs. Now you are looking up at 700 foot sand dunes, and the people climbing them look like ants. It was 70 degrees with a breeze so up we went. The sand started getting warm, but for open toed sandals it got too warm by the time we reached about 250 feet up. We also didn't bring water, so we started the easier hike down. People were commenting on how you thought you were getting to the top, and once there, found out that you were on a crest, but then there were higher peaks and you were only partway there. It felt good to get back in the water and were told that once all the snow is gone in a few weeks, that the river dries up. We headed out to the Sand Dunes Swimming Pool to get even more sunshine and didn't get caught up in farm traffic again.","June 27, 2016","Are we at the beach, the desert, or the mountains?

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We had great fun there as it was a special combination of snow mountains, sand dunes and running stream in one place. Beautiful natural scenery all around.It was fun to play in the stream and watched the constantly changing current flowing along - some time strong, some time gentle; always changing pattern. Walk on the fine sand or climb to top of sand dunes if you have the time, are fit and can fight the heat and the strong sun. It would take about 2 hours to reach the top (we didn't go up as we were short of time). Be alert that you could get tired very easily after walking short distance on the sand. Must bring along enough drinking water. Also, do be aware that sand under direct sunlight could turn burning hot in seconds. Do wear shoes and avoid slippers or sandals. This is a place ideal for family outing, especially for young kids to weave along the stream. It could well take up half a day or even the whole day. Bring along food and drinks for picnic, big umbrella for the hot sun or a big tent to shelter from the burning sun.","June 27, 2016",Must go if you are in the area,162,Hong Kong,5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,The sand dunes are a must see if you're traveling in the area. We went early morning and we were glad we did! By noon it was getting busy and the sand was getting very hot. We did rent a sand sled at the Oasis store right before you enter the park. The cost was $20 per sled and you had it for the day. I am an adult with married children and I had a blast sledding down the dunes! Of course after you go down you have the walk back up.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"So, to start my review, I'm issuing a warning...when traveling to the Great Sand Dunes, DO NOT go over the MEDANO PASS if you are not FULLY EQUIPPED to do so. Basically, Jeep or other very high raised 4 wheel drive vehicle is ESSENTIAL to get through sand, rocks, and water. My friends GPS took us this way to get to the Great Sand Dunes. NOT A GOOD IDEA! we had no idea how treacherous it was until it was too late for us to turn around, so do yourself a favor, if you are traveling to the Dunes, take CO 160 from Walsenburg. The Dunes are worth the drive, but NOT over the Medano Pass. Best time to go would be early May, though. The snowmelt will produce a higher level of water to float on. Review the website before visiting for the most up to date info on conditions at the park. We visited in late June and there was only about 3-4 inches of snowmelt to play in. Lower water level was good for the toddler in the group and very refreshing to play in, but the mosquitoes were insane!!! The water is a breeding ground for the stinging pests! Bring repellent and SUNSCREEN! The Dunes get REALLY HOT but are so amazing to see and climb! Bring lots of water, and boots or shoes with high socks are the best ways to keep the hot sand out off of your ankles. I highly recommend stopping at the Oasis before you get to the admission gate for sand sleds or sand boards. Snowboards and snowsleds don't work particularly well on the sand. The Oasis rents the sleds/boards for $20 for the entire day. Lots of fun for anyone! Its an amazing phenomenon!","June 25, 2016",Must see,24,"Denver, Colorado",5

The stream was up to knee deep but several places were quite shallow. All ages from toddlers to adults were able to enjoy playing in the water. If you are planning to hang out from a while, a canopy of large shade umbrella is a great idea. If hiking the dunes in sandals, wear socks, too! The sand gets very hot during the day. The view of 700-800 foot dunes against the mountains is breath-taking! I don't know if you can see this anywhere else in the world.

We waded in the water and then tackled some of the dunes til about 730. We went back the following morning to do a hike around 800 but the mosquitos were fierce so we left.

This place is neat in as much as it is very unusual. I mean, who expects to find great, huge piles of sand in the middle of a mountain platuea? However, as someone who usually is most interested in history or beautiful hikes, this place is a bit dissapointing. You can climb the dunes, the views of the mountains and valleys are lovely but it just lacks the kind of beautiful and shady mountain hikes we are accustomed to seeking out. Once I had waded the creek, climbed around the dunes a bit I was like: Now what? If you are into sand surfing the dunes and such, perhaps this a bit more exciting but it just doesn't make my list of places to return to. Glad I saw it to say I did but it does not top my favorite of the National Parks I have seen.","June 14, 2016",Not sure what I expected but I found it a bit dissapointing.,120,"Denver, Colorado",3
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"If you are not normally active or are not used to the elevation, I highly suggest planning at least two days at the dunes.

The park has a nice visitor center and the parking lot of enjoying the dunes has restroom, changing, and rinsing facilities. There are quite a few hiking trails within the park, but we didn't explore them as time was limited and we weren't sure our bug spray would effectively keep the mosquitoes at bay.","June 14, 2016",Worth the trip!,2,Addison,5

Once we started climbing the dunes, we found our trekking poles helpful. The photography was spectacular. On top of High Dune, we captured the beauty of the surrounding area. Unfortunately, due to a long, lingering winter, the upper reaches of Medano Pass Road was closed so we were unable to hike in that area.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"After living in Colorado for 20+ years, I finally had the chance to explore the Great Sand Dunes a few days ago. My friends and I rented sandboards from Kristi's Mountain Sports in Alamosa. Personally, if I could do it over again, I'd just rent from the Oasis shop which is right outside the park entrance (would've saved us a lot more time). Parking was tight that day but luckily we got there early enough to get a good spot. The sand dunes were a great time. Highly recommend packing sunscreen, sunglasses, towel, socks, good hiking shoes or sandals, and plenty of water. Took us quite awhile to get to the highest sand dune but going down the dune at 35mph on our sandboards was an experience of a lifetime. I recommend using a pair of socks as gloves so if you use your hands to maintain control as your drag them down the dune, it won't burn your hands. Wear socks as some parts of the sand get as hot as 150 degrees F. Beautiful views all around. Fun time for everyone. Get there early as the afternoon storms tend to roll in fairly fast.","June 8, 2016",Awesome place,3,,5

Like a beach with people set in umbrellas and beach chairs right in and along the river. The dunes are an amazing sight, higher than they appear in photos, with snow capped mountains as a backdrop. Hike to the top of the biggest one if you are able and up to the physical challange or just soak in the view from lower down. Its a workout walking the deep sand.

According to all the signs the sand can get scorching hot (unlike White Sands, NM) so come early and wear proper shoes! You can hike all over the sand dunes, just be prepared because it can take quite some time.We parked in the first parking lot as you drive in. Hot tip: Check how much the water is flowing before crossing it with hiking boots on...it was deeper than we thought in two sections so we had wet socks for a few hours. There can be some rocky parts of the sand so it can be a little hurty on the feet but better than wet socks. We didn't hike to the highest dune, just picked one and went for it. We walked with our sand board and pretty much boarded back down but if you do that, be really careful of the real steep parts. It was a lot of fun though! There was heaps of people sand boarding as we were leaving.Another hot tip: there's two bathrooms in the car park. The first one you come to right there, the first one people see so everyone stops at it and it's a long drop. There's a sign saying more restrooms up this path, and they are literally like a 30 second walk - and NOT A LONG DROP!! Running water and everything!! The car park management was a little lacking. There was plenty of available spaces when we first got back to the car, (about 10am) which ended up mostly filling up, but they didn't have a good one in one out system so a lot were being missed and there were car's almost all the way back to the main road.

I had been several years ago in the middle of the summer, but at this time of the year Medano Creek is flowing adding even more to explore! Several of the boys were interested in sand boarding on the dunes (rented from Sand Dunes Oasis - $20/board/day includes wax). Many of them were quite proficient by the end of the day! Other boys were happy to play ""Dune Soccer"" and still others had a blast playing in the creek. The deepest areas of the creek that we saw was about a foot to a foot and a half, more than enough to play in! The parents had a great time as well. The visitors center is a great place to learn about how the Dunes formed. I would highly recommend this trip to anyone who has not been - and a return trip for those that have! When hiking the dunes be sure to have either closed shoes (hiking boots, sneakers, etc) NOT sandals, or at least a pair of socks. The sand gets VERY HOT. Bring sunscreen, sunglasses, a hat, and a wind breaker.

The sand upstream temporarily dams up the water then breaks and releases a small surge. It was fun seeing the beautiful patterns in the sand in the creek and the dunes. The park is great for photographers! We saw people sliding down the dunes on rented sand boards, there are 2 types - stand up or sit down boards. The highest dune is >750 feet high. We didn't hike to the top due to a lack of time. There are many different areas of the park that require a 4-wheel drive vehicle to access.

The NP has a lot of activity for serious off roaders and hikers but is (in our mind) mainly for the family. There are several hikes on short to longish trails and include views, streams, rock outcroppings, etc. The main attraction are the dunes. These rise 750 feet but appear dwarfed by the 13,000 ft mountains. You wade across a shallow river (in May) to reach the dunes and off you go! The 8,000 ft altitude may take some getting used to but that soon passes. There are maybe 4 ""layers"" of dunes each higher than the last until you reach the 750 peak but not all enjoy an endurance climb. Some just wander up and down the dunes for awhile then quit for the day. Others try the unique experience of sand boarding or sledding. The boards/sleds can be rented locally or in Alamosa. We saw younger people try the boards while we tried the sleds. We found them next to impossible to control, usually we ended up going down slope backwards! We had fun for a couple of hours then time to go, weary but thrilled to have such a great experience.","May 24, 2016","Sand, sand, sand & fun",90,"Melbourne, Florida",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"It is a giant sandbox and super fun if you come with the right expectations. Bring what you would bring if you were going to a California beach....sand castle making supplies, cooler full of food and drinks, lawn chairs, sun screen, and settle in to enjoy the day. If you are climbing the sand dunes to sled be sure to have sandles or swim shoes to protect your feet from the heat. (You can rent sleds there.) Lots of camping spots but it was windy and we preferred to stay in a hotel in Alamosa.","May 22, 2016",It is a mountain of sand....,16,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5

I went for birding, as of May 21 there was no birding to be found, BUT, wow, folks from many states were piled in. Come prepared, do your homework, this is not an easy task.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"The Great Sand Dunes National Park is expansive and a beautiful park. The sand dunes shift all the time, but the climb to the top is daunting. The local trees and deer are interesting. I would say of all the national parks we visited, this one was interesting and certainly worth the visit, but not one of my favorites. A lot of sand. You get the picture.","May 19, 2016",A Lot of Sand,112,"Sharon, Massachusetts",3
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Sand dunes is that place to come for those of all ages. Late spring early summer the small river that runs just east of the Dunes mesmerizes you as the sand changes the flow and ripples of the water creating an illusion. Bring your sleds, your Frisbees, your golf clubs. This is a playground that will entice your imagination. Hike to the highest dune.... run back down running jumping and leaping. Burry a family member or friend in the sand. The Visitor Center has a wealth of knowledge for this unique Oasis.","May 18, 2016",Amazing fun,61,Denver,4

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Pros: Unique setting, imposing sand dunes, Zapata Falls nearby was spectacular, quietest national park in the lower 48 states, not crowded or overly commercializedCons: Limited things to do beyond trekking in the sand and sandboarding.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Wow, 700 foot sand dunes. A creek that disappears or can be 30 yards wide. Incredible sunrises and sunsets. Sand, mountains, and wildlife. Hike, Sled, Sand Board, or PicnicWHEN TO GO: Spring or Fall are the best because temps are reasonable and the creek in the spring is cool and fun for kids. In summer the temps can reach well over 100 degrees (Air temp) and the sand can reach 140 degrees. Go early like before 9am or just before sunset. Winter can be beautiful, but in any season the dunes can be windy, and in winter very cold. Sand and wind are not fun. WHAT TO DO: When the creek is running and the air is warm playing on the beach in the mountains is magical. The hike to the high dune is worth the effort. The view from the top is amazing. A wonderful picnic area is shady and just off the dunes. Getting their early is great way to see wildlife like antelope, deer, fox, coyote, and others. Like adventure you can rent sandboards and sleds. Kids love build and digging in the sand. The visitors center is small but very nice. It is a good way to get out of the heat or cold. It also is a great way to learn about the local history the dunes and wildlife. Photographers will love this place and the morning light can be fabulous.PREPARED: Sunscreen and sun protection (hats, long sleeves, etc..) along with water is a must. Get their early since it can get very crowded. Try Zapata Falls or Alamosa Wildlife Area as well","May 15, 2016",Great Sand Dunes is GREAT for everyone!,67,"Denver, Colorado",5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Taking a roundabout path to New Mexico, we visited Great Sand Dunes National Park in April. We had a beautiful day (missing the previous week's snowstorm). From the orientation at the visitor center to walking the sand ramp to the top of the dunes, everything was first rate. Recommend allowing four hours for experiencing the dunes. I cannot imagine what it would be like in the summertime, but recommend a wide brimmed hat, polarized sunglasses, well-fitting shoes, plenty of water, healthy snacks, and a camera. From the picture I provided, you may be able to get a little perspective of the size based on the people in the foreground and those heading up the sand ramp.","April 28, 2016",Desert in the Rockies,17,"Golden, Colorado",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"The best time to visit, in my opinion, is in the evening. The light is amazing for photographs and its a little cooler. The dunes, massive in size, look small compared to the larger mountains in the background. WARNING: if you come from a low elevation or are not used to high elevations be careful, this park is over 8 thousand feet and I experienced some altitude sickness after climbing around on the dunes! Also, bring lots of water! ","April 25, 2016",Fun way to spend the day,23,,5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We took an impromptu mini vacation here and it happened to be during ""free park entrance"" weekend. Our kids, ages 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1/2 all LOVED it. We love to get them out in nature and the sand dunes were a huge hit with all ages. We had never been, and didn't know what to expect, but it was a great trip. We will be going back in years to come so the older kids can sled down them. This time, we just rolled down them... You will take lots of sand home with you no matter what you do, but it's Definitely worth it! ","April 24, 2016",Great experience and fun day for kids,8,"Concord, North Carolina",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"Honestly I had never heard of Great Sand Dunes until I was planning a road trip from Houston to Utah. Such a unique and interesting place! Absolutely worth spending a day or two here! The dunes are huge and sit at the base of snow capped mountains.We rented sand boards from Kristi Mountain Sports in Alamosa (I think you can also get them from the store near the entrance to the park) and spent several hours sand boarding down the dunes. Lots of fun! We also drove our Jeep down the primitive Medina Pass Rd and enjoyed the views of the dunes and mountains (the pass wasn't open the entire distance in mid April).Also it's at a higher elevation than the surrounding area, so be prepared for cooler weather depending on when you go (we were there mid April and it snowed 4 inches the morning we left).","April 24, 2016","Unique, surreal place!",14,"Houston, Texas",5
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"The Great Sand Dunes National Park seems secluded and secret because of the distance to reach it, but there are plenty of road markers along the way, and once you're on the Route 150 stretch, it's tough to miss. The sand is pristine, aside from footprints and animal tracks, and the landscape is quite unlike anything else you're likely to see in Colorado, or anywhere else in the U.S. If you're driving around dawn or dusk, watch out for wildlife - the deer and rabbits are everywhere.","April 21, 2016",Surreal and amazing,10,"Florham Park, United States",5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,A great park to visit! Take a good walk on the highest dunes (try to walk in people's footsteps who walked in front of you: it is easier to march this way in the sand); then take some trails around - in July there are a lot of wild flowers blooming. Good for one or two days. Think of reservations in the nearby hotels (if you don't like to camp) soon enough. In July everything is booked out.,"April 21, 2016",Great Sand Dunes National Park,19,"Heidelberg, Germany",4
Great Sand Dunes National Park,"I first visited this place as I was moving back from California to Kansas and unfortunately did not have the time to really explore. As a result, I drove 10 hours from Kansas to visit this amazing place again. I took ""Lane 6"" from the West towards the park which has a really cool abandoned house that one can see the mountains and sand dunes from...a great photo opportunity. Upon arriving I was stunned by the beauty of the massive sand dunes and snow-capped mountains surrounding me. It was quite windy and cold the first day I went so I didn't get much accomplished, but the next morning was quite nice. Don't let yourself be fooled, these sand dunes are large and can get quite steep so be prepared for a climb and plan accordingly. I saw many children with their sleds so if you want a fun activity then grab a cheap sled and you can slide down the dunes very quickly. I didn't have the opportunity to explore the area as thoroughly as I wanted, but I would say that one should allot 3-4 days in order to see the dunes, mountains, and surrounding areas. This is one of the most beautiful and amazing places I have visited thus far. The great thing is that the park is open 24/7 so if you want to go out at night and get some night photos then it is completely ok. I will say though, I went out at night and it is very very dark obviously so it can get very creepy if you don't have someone to accompany you. Don't let this one pass you by if you are even remotely close to the area.","April 20, 2016","A Gem in The American National Park's System, Don't Miss This Beauty!",147,"Hangzhou, China",5

There's often a lot of water to cross in order to get to the dunes too. It's a great work out and you can bring your dogs along with you. The views of the Sangre de Christo mountains are delightful.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,High season is late May and Early June. Warm enough to play in the water (a creek runs along side) but not so hot as high summer (they publish it gets 150 degrees on the sand...ouch). April was pretty cool for us. warm sand with shoes off. a little bit of water to play in but not the shin deep wave/surg that comes high season. much easier to get around since there were fewer people (still folks there the whole time we were). might be a good idea to bring extra shoes and socks.

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We visited the Great Sand Dunes Nat'l Park as a side trip and ended up staying longer than anywhere else. The dunes are awesome to behold. Be sure to study up on the geology of the place before or during your visit. It is mind-bending to see these dunes with mountains as a backdrop. You can certainly summit them (we didn't) and sled down them (uh, nope) but walking the trails up to and around them is inspirational enough. We went in early spring so temperature was not an issue. In fact, there was a small creek running at their base. But summer weather must be a challenge. Wear shoes that are sand (and water in spring) worthy, although I saw some folks, young and old, who were bare-footed. You can't grasp the hugeness of their breadth and height until you are very close so take the drive off the main highway and spend some time playing in the sand!","April 13, 2016",It's Great!

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"It is a long walk from the parking to the edge of the very first dunes that are ant hills compared to the peaks within the park. That is as far as we made it with small kids but it was still a great day. We watched Medano creek begin its flow early in the morning and had it trickle toward our feet. We used a rented sled to sail down the hills and got our workout climbing back up. We played with the iron filings pulled from the sand with a magnet. We returned to the creek to dig trenches and splash and play in the sand. By coming early in the year we avoided the crowds, the high temperatures, and the bugs. We lucked out on having a day that wasn't so windy. The downside to early season was having none of the bathrooms or showers available to wash off. The park is beautiful with the impressive dunes and the backdrop of the snow covered peaks. A vehicle pass to enter the park is valid for a week.","April 10, 2016",Family fun,186,"Longmont, Colorado",5

Great Sand Dunes National Park,"We were on a long road trip prior to moving back to the east coast from Colorado - where we have lived for three years. We just had to finally stop at the Great Sand Dunes because we had heard so much about it from friends and neighbors. I'm so glad we did. Here are some tips:- quite a drive from any town...bring a cooler and lunch unless you are sure you can wait. - bring water, and don't climb at midday - sand gets too hot. - rent a sled from the Oasis, you won't regret it! Unfortunately you'll pay the full day rate no matter how long you use the sled.- the visitor center is very nice, if you have kids try to get them to do the Junior Ranger program. This park in particular gives kids the option of getting the badge or a patch if they complete the program. It's an informative program and the rangers are really into it:)- do your best, if you are healthy enough, to get to the top of first dune. The views are spectacular! Imagine having snow capped mountains in the background of your desert hike!The bottom line is that it is a great out of the way park without a lot of visitors...that alone is worth a consideration!","April 5, 2016",What a sleeper National Park!
