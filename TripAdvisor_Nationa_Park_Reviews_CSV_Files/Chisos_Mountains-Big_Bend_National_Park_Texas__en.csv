Chisos Mountains,"Stunning sunsets from here: to avoid a long drive after the sunset, I recommend staying in The Chisos Mountain Lodge. Every night the sunset looked completely different as that night's cloud formations change the light. We were fortunate to see three magnificent sunsets. There is patio next to the restaurant, which, should you not want to walk a trail to the viewing area, offers a great view and the opportunity to drink an alcoholic beverage in comfort too. Ample parking. We stayed in early June, during a severe drought, so The Chisos Mountains stood out as a green oasis in a sun-baked desert.

Chisos Mountains,"Here I write about the Basin Loop Trail in the basin area of the Chisos Mountains in Big bend National Park. This trail provides an all around view of the basin mountains as you complete hiking the loop inside the basin. The trail has pretty good elevation changes as it goes up and down next to the lodge, the campground and the Window area. The trail is pretty rocky at some places, so start with good shoes and be sure-footed. We saw several deer, and a couple of them stood around right next to the trail pretty close to us. This trail intersects with several other trails that start from the basin. I found some of the trail markers to be not clear with directions at some crossings, especially where more than two trails intersected. I would not call this a must-do trail in the park, but it could be a good choice if you have extra time and need to burn off some calories.","April 28, 2018",Chisos Basin Loop Trail - GO,157,"Kansas City, Missouri",5

We hoped to see a bear with no luck, but did see many birds and some deer. The issue we had was trying to get into Chisos Basin during Spring Break. Who knew it was outdoor Disney World and we needed a fast pass? First day a Ranger had the road blocked mid-day due to the limited amount of parking. The next day we made sure to arrive by 8:30am and had no problem getting a parking spot at Lost Mine Trail and then at the lodge after the hike. I’m sure outside of Spring Break parking isn’t an issue but we found several areas that were closed off or had long waits for parking.

Chisos Mountains,"Big Bend National Park and the various hikes in the Chisos were on our (my wife and me) bucket lists. Checked'm off!! We spent 4 days hiking and sight-seeing in the Basin and at Boquillos and Santa Elena Canyons. We completed the Window/Pour-Out hike in half-day, and then took 9.5 hours for the 12.5 mile round trip to the South Wall. Spectacular!! As a retired geologist, I was awed by the views and the exposed geology of the volcanics and structures along the Rio Grande rifting. Even if you are not a geologist, I think you will be surprised and awe-struck the diversity of the rocks, formations, and yes dinosaur fossils exposed within the park. Please take advantage of these natural wonders the Park Service has preserved and curated. Although, Big Bend is not easy to get to, everyone should try hard to visit. Our US National Parks are truly inspiring in their natural beauty, and all of us who are fortunate enough to get to visit, will leave much better persons.

Hiking boots are a MUST as trail can be a little rocky at times while dirt other parts. Cool views of “the window” looking into Mexico with a great place to snap photos.

We had 360 degree mountain views from our lovely shaded camp table. The mountain atmosphere was cooler in temperature than other areas of the park, and had much more lush desert greenery. Our site was about 10 steps away from the 5ish mile Window trailhead. We were warned of mountain lion activity in the area but thankfully did not encounter one of these majestic creatures.

Chisos Mountains,"The Chisos (means Spirit or Ghost) Mountains hold a Special Place for those travelers seeking peace and solitude.

In fact, it's easy to feel as if you have just discovered the Park! The mountains change color as the day progresses, each bringing fabulous photo opportunities. Some mountains have Native American faces carved into them if you look closely enough and other shapes, such as hearts and eagles can be seen in pattern of the rocks.Definitely, bring your camera!Once your entry fee has been paid, you may park anywhere in the park or along side the road and venture forth into the land of adventure.

Chisos Mountains,"My husband and I and friends planned our visit as the highlight of a two week northern winter weather get-away. We were there in early March and the park was busy at spring break. We booked a campsite at the Basin Campground the day they became available (6 months out), which was necessary since all campgrounds as well as the state park campground were full. We booked site 56, but found the rocky path difficult to navigate and worked with the very helpful camp host (thanks, Mark) to switch to site 53. Although the Basin Campground has unreserved sites, they were picked up early in the morning. We camped in tents--only small RV'S are able to navigate the road. The sites are small and rocky, but the campground is amazing--the night skies alone make at least one overnight a must. The weather was quite warm during the day (high 70's) but quite cool at night (50's). The bathrooms were kept clean, and we combined a hike at Boquillos Canyon and Hot Springs with the 30 mile drive one day to the Rio Grande Village to shower. Lost Mine Trail was probably our favorite hike, although we enjoyed Window Trail and Grapevine. We did a one day river trip (canoe at this time of year) with Big Bend River Tours and really enjoyed the perspective from the river. We ate twice at the Lodge and the food was quite good and surprisingly affordable. Overall, amazing area and fantastic trip!","March 17, 2017",Fantastic Vacation Location ,156,Michigan,5

Chisos Mountains,"The Chisos Mountains, wholly contained within Big Bend National Park and surrounded by the harsh Chihuahuan Desert, rise to an elevation of 7,831 feet (2,387m) creating an island of cooler, more moist environment in the sky which supports an isolated forest of oaks, pines, junipers, big-tooth maple and Arizona cypress with a wide variety of birds usually found further north, squirrels, bear, mountain lion, fox and deer. These mountains, coupled with the desert and the Rio Grande, are the three features that make Big Bend a unique, wonderful place to visit.In the center of the mountains is the Chisos Basin which contains the park’s lodge with a restaurant, campground, visitor center, store and over 20 miles (32k) of trails including the popular Window and Lost Mine trails.While we did not stay in the Chisos, each afternoon, after spending the morning exploring the desert below, we would retreat to this cooler island in the sky, get an ice cream at the store, enjoy the mountain views, and hike a trail.

I believe this is more than sufficient to be fully immersed in everything Chisos has to offer.

Chisos Mountains,The Chisos Mountains of the Big Bend National Park are a hiker's paradise. There are trails coming out of the Basin complex going in almost all directions. There is one wheelchair accessible trail but the rest are varying degrees of hiking. I highly recommend the South Rim Loop. It can be done two ways: clockwise via the Pinnacles Trail (quite steep in places) or counter-clockwise via the longer but more gentle Laguna Meadow Trail. Numerous back-country camping spots are sprinkled along the trails and require a back-country camping permit available at the Visitor Center.

Learned after we did it that it is know as ""the most strenuous hike in Texas."" I believe it! It helps to be in shape and have good knees if you are going to do this.

Chisos Mountains,"My husband and I went backpacking through the Chisos for his 30th. When we arrived we checked in at the visitors center to grab our backcountry permit. The staff was very knowledgeable and suggested our different sites for the 2 nights based on where we wanted to hike. We didn't have a problem getting the sites we wanted in the backcountry. Upon leaving the visitors center we drove to Santa Elena Canyon and hiked a couple of hours in the canyon. My advice is to pass up the boat launch and the canyon overlook stops and go straight to the trail even if you're not going to hike it. It's a better view. The canyon trail is very easy to follow and not very hard. The views are stunning. Standing next to the canyon, you'll feel like an ant. The trail goes on quite a ways with inclines and declines but, again, it's far from strenuous. After leaving the canyon we drove to the Chisos Mountain Lodge area where the mountain trailheads begin. There is a little store down there along with full functioning restrooms. We geared up with our packs and set out on the trail from the parking lot. It's a short walk before you come upon a trail marker pointing you in the right direction. Everything throughout is very well marked. We took the Pinnacles trail. This trail takes you through a nice meadow area and then the switchbacks start. If you're in any kind of respectable shape at all, you'll be fine. With the views changing around every bend, we stopped quite a bit for photos. It took us about 2 hours to get to the Pinnacles 1 campsite where we were staying the first night. The site was fantastic. Almost broken up into ""rooms"" by large boulders. There were 2 bear boxes, we used that area as the kitchen to keep all food scents away from our sleeping area since it is bear/mountain lion country. There was a large boulder and plenty of space between the food prep area and where our tent was along with a couple of other large boulders that sectioned off a place to clean up/change or use the restroom (as there are no compost toilets nearby). The view was stunning sleeping right at the base of the pinnacles. We even had a charming ringtail visit us. There are also tiny little field mice that live under the boulders. A few greeted us that night but no bears or mountain lions. The next morning we packed up and headed back to the main trail (about 200 yards) and continued going up to get to the Toll Mountain 1 campsite where we would stay on night two. The switchbacks got a lot more rigorous and steep. Our hike to the TM1 campsite was about half the distance as the day before but took us almost the same amount of time as we stopped often to take in the ever changing views and catch our breath (you gain a good amount of elevation on this portion). Remember you're still in the desert and hydration is extremely important. When we reached the TM1 campsite it took my breath away. It sits at the top of Toll Mountain the endless views of the mountains. There are large rocks on the edge that's fantastic for sitting and taking everything in. Again, there were 2 bear boxes and then a separate area under trees for the tent. The temp is about 20 degrees cooler up there and there is no shelter from the wind at TM1. We set up camp and then grabbed our daypacks to go conquer Emory Peak. The Emory Peak trail is only 200-300 yards away. At the trailhead there are benches, lockers and a compost toilet (bring your own TP). The trail starts easy but hits you like a ton of bricks on the last portion. Everyone talks about a rock scramble. There will be the beginning of what you think is the scramble...but that's not it. You'll know when you've arrived. Small, medium, large rocks/boulders that you have to maneuver. While I believe the average human being can handle it, just make sure you save some energy for the last portion. It's not easy by any means. There are tree branches and such you can use along the way to help you out. Sturdy shoes are a must, I certainly wouldn't tackle it in sandals or converse (I saw people wearing both). You'll reach the ""top"" when you see the valley with a rock tower to each side. Top is in quotes because you don't technically summit the peak until you climb up one of the towers (which a lot do). This offers a 360 degree view. If you're afraid of heights you won't want to climb up one of the towers. We climbed the left and it's nothing but air around you. The wind rips through the valley and you won't see the birds up there but you'll certainly hear them fly by. If you stay at the base where the valley is, it's a wonderful experience with rocks you can walk out on between the towers. A great place to relax and fuel up for the descend. After heading back to the TM1 campsite we got ready to view the sunset. Between the campsite and the main trail there is a rock formation that we climbed up and had a stunning view of the Window at sunset. The sky turned gold, dark amber and slowly faded over to pink, blue and purple shades. It was stellar! That night we had another ringtail visit us at camp (no bears/mountain lions). We settled in for bed after watching a killer lightning storm in the distance. Our tent was stakes in tight and thankfully so. The wind ripped through there at night and the temps dropped.The next morning we ate breakfast with a whitetail deer in our site before we packed up and made the descend. My thighs hurt the next two days but I'd do it every day if I could! All in all the one way hike was about 6 miles. ","May 7, 2016",Truly magical place to turn 30!,5,"Houston, Texas",5

Take the Laguna Meadow Trail up (not as steep) and the Pinnacles Trail down (steep, rocky, many steps and switchbacks) to make the hike a loop. If you do it this way the hike up to the high ridge will be mostly in the shade. When you reach the South Rim in about 5.8 miles the views will wow your mind. During Falcon nesting season Feb thru May part of the South Rim Trail is closed so take the scenic Boot Canyon Trail to the Pinnacles Trail to get back to the lodge parking lot. My group of six took our time and made it an almost nine hour hike including the time taking in the South Rim views. Totally awesome. Take plenty of water - you will need it. I had my camel pack. Bring lunch and eat while you take in the views at the rim. There are some well placed compost toilets along the trail, so no need to go to the bathroom off trail unless you absolutely need to. Bring your own tp. I also took along some bear spray, but we didn't see any. Go in a group and talk along the way and you should be fine.

But they don't really hurt people. Just be careful not to litter. The restaurant ""Indian Lodge"" serves good food. Chisos mountains are definitely worth visiting.

Chisos Mountains,"This remote park is a delight for the eyes, but travelers need to be wise before heading in.Although the park does have two gas stations, remember to get gas and water BEFORE you go to the Marathon northeast junction at Route 90 (entrance to park is about 40 miles from there, and Panther Junction with gas is about 26 miles from that entrance). When we got to Marathon, both brothers' stations were closed, so you can't be sure you can get gas there. We went into the park on our last gallons.As of 22 November 2015, the water main was broken in Rio Grande Village, leaving campers and travelers without any bathroom facilities, or drinking water. The only warning at the entrance to the park mentioned no showers; they forgot to mention no water at all. Double-check this.Costs $25 to get in. Take cash in case Internet goes down. Cell phone coverage depends on carrier. Altitude can be a factor. Watch out for rustic hotels in near-by towns!Otherwise, the food at the lodge is still delicious.

We were camping by the Rio Grande and drove to the central lodge area, then did a day hike into the Chisos Mountains. I only wish we had more time, there were endless trails and pieces of history to see. We did this trip in December and it was 20s some nights and 50s some days. Dressing in layers was key. We saw lots of wildlife and even had a park ranger tell us a mountain lion had been spotted just an hour earlier, attracted to the grazing deer. Loved every minute of my time there.

Chisos Mountains,"We had a 3 day hike with a two night camping stay. After registering for the trip and obtaining the required permits we were off on our adventure. One can't believe the beauty we found. It's so crazy to be driving literally through sand dunes, cross over a hill, and suddenly be face to face with a mountain range! It's very similar to driving from Kansas and entering Colorado. I won't bore you with the backpacking details, it's a great hike. But just pass on some info we discovered. The first night we slept up on the mountain. The campsites have bear boxes and are well maintained. There is no camp fires allowed so be prepared to fix your meals another way. The mountain sites are 10 to 15 degrees colder at night than what the weather reports will indicate. The second night we stayed at the base of the mountains in zone camping. Make sure you call ahead if you want a zone camping permit. They will not issue it if the weather is too hot. We want in mid October and were told that they had just started issuing the permits. The reason behind this is that you can't carry enough water with you to safely make it in and out. We cached our water in two locations at the base of the mountain. The dirt roads to get to these locations were pretty rough. We were very glad we had the all wheel drive Subaru Forester. A truck or SUV is a must. We had two bear encounters. Both times the bears were much more interested in eating berries and pretty much ignored our presence. We kept or distance as not to interfere with their ""back yard"" and they allowed us to snap plenty of photographs. The deer will literally walk right through your camp! So make sure you don't leave anything that could harm them out. When at a campsite they provide bear boxes for food storage. I forgot to secure a power bar and left it outside a container inside the bear box. I apparently fed some mice! Lol. They are bear proof, but not critter proof. Hahaha Visit the rim! The views are breathtaking and you can see right into Mexico. Speaking of Mexico, we had to clear through a border patrol check point just outside the park. There are numerous locations and lots of border patrol agents. It made us feel a lot safer knowing that they were monitoring the area so closely.

Start off on the pinnacles trail and follow for south rim. The best here. 2. Lost mine trail: 5 miles. Great walk, the busiest we've seen in the park. Quite steep and fab views at the end. 3. Window trail: easy 5 miler. Fantastic view at the very end, not much reward in the interim, worth doing. 4. Blue creek canyon trail: 45 min drive from the lodge. The first part is in the dry creek bed (wash) itself. It's easy to follow and the rock formations are awesome. The second part (after 3 miles or so) is harder to follow and not as pretty.

Chisos Mountains,"The Chisos has something for all skill levels. One can stay near the lodge, walk the Window View trail, and enjoy the front country with ease, or you could take a trail deeper into seclusion. This area is doable even in summer as the elevation will keep you much cooler than the desert floor below. Lost Mine Trail and Emory Peak are fairly popular, and both offer great views. The South Rim is further out and more strenous, but it is worth it. The backcountry is popular with birders as many species can be observed here. Wildlife viewing is always a possibility, even near the lodge and the campground. Sunsets through the Window are a must see. Then there are the starry nights with views of the Milky Way in the summer. The only real disadvantage is the large distance from where most of us live, but that same deterrent factor will normally prevent crowds associated with some other national parks.

Photos look best when the light is low in the sky.On the way down, the temps will have risen...you'll be comfortable, while folks hiking up in the mid day sun will be roasting!There are three terrific hikes in the Chisos you should not miss. #1 The Lost Mine Trail #2 The Windows trail and #3 for those willing to put in the effort (7-9 hours) the South Rim trail (Go up the Laguna Meadows Trail and down the Pinnacles Trail).

If touring the park, start with a full gas tank (there is one station at Panther Junction) and keep alot of drinking water handy. I really enjoyed the display in the Basin visitor center concerning the life history of one of the cougers with a tracking tag. We ate lunch at the lodge which was good food, reasonable price, and a good view. The service was a bit spotty but that gave us more time to enjoy the scenery from out table.

Chisos Mountains,"Though topographical maps indicate a trail to Maple Canyon, in actuality, there is only the slightest suggestion of a trail. Map notwithstanding, access to the canyon is quick and relatively easy. The trailhead is easy to find. Located about halfway between the Basin and Basin Junction, it is marked by a fire-danger sign and a brown gate loaded with reflectors. Take care not to block this gate, as it provides access to the service road for the power line into the Basin. There is enough space for one vehicle along the road without blocking the gate, plus a pullout just downhill from the gate along the Basin Road.The first 1/4 mile, or so, of the hike follows this two-track service road. You will come to a clearing with a pile of gravel in its midst. The two-track continues on the other side of the clearing. A short uphill section will lead to a second, much-smaller clearing where the foot trail begins to the right. It is marked by a couple of small cairns and an arrow fashioned from downed limbs. If you get the feeling that you have been walking alongside the power lines for too long, then you have probably missed the cut-off. Another mile, or so, along the partly shaded trail, and you will arrive at the creek bottom. The trail is quite faint, but it is marked by many small cairns. The trail’s surface is packed throughout. Sotols and various other spiny bushes have encroached, so wearing long pants is suggested. As you make your way deeper into the canyon, the sound of traffic on the Basin Road will be replaced by the calls of Canyon Wrens, Cactus Wrens, and Rock Squirrels. Approaching the usually dry creek, signs of bear (scat and upturned sotols) become increasingly abundant. A shallow slope descends to the rocky creek bed where two cairns are located on opposite banks of the creek. The creek bed here is shaded by deciduous oaks, live oaks, and madrone.If you are sure-footed and nimble, you can continue up canyon, picking your way over not-too-large boulders that come in a wide range of colors. The temperature cools the further up canyon you venture, due mostly to increased shading provided by the looming, nearly vertical walls of Pulliam Bluff on the right and Pulliam Peak on the left. If you climb far enough, you will eventually reach a small stand of bigtooth maple and Mexican buckeye, and in October, you might be rewarded by bright red maple foliage. We visited in February and the dead, brown leaves were still on the trees. Here, you may also note the distinctive, sour smell of willow. At this point, you will have climbed about 300 feet in elevation from the gate. On the way back up the slope out of the creek bottom, we found mosses and liverworts; not exactly the vegetation one expects to see in the Big Bend.The drawing points of this hike: it’s easy, short, shaded, close to the Basin and, except for the bear, you are likely to be alone.","February 24, 2015","Maple Canyon: Seldom-Visited, Secluded Nook in the Chisos",21,"Concord, California",4
Chisos Mountains,"The Chisos Mountains are an absolute must when visiting Big Bend National Park. The diversity of the mountain environment encapsulated within the Chihuahuan Desert provides some of the most dramatic scenery within the park. Whether you are touring by auto or have the time to enjoy some of the splendid hiking you won't be disappointed. Take the time to enjoy the respite from the desert and, if you do hike, there are some great options. The Lost Mine hike (about 5 miles RT goes up about 1,200 feet with some switchbacks) provides exceptional mountain views along with changes in the forest as you climb. The trail is excellent and is no more than moderate in difficulty. If you can, plan to hike early as the trail head parking lot is small and fills up quickly. The other hike we took was the window Trail. The trail can be accessed from either the Chisos Basin parking area or the campground just below. We opted for the campground (shorter by about 1.2 miles). Its slightly down hill out and the reverse back. The trail ends at top of the window pour off. Look through the window but don't get too close as the rocks are slick and it's a long way down. Start early if you can as the trail offers little shade.","February 23, 2015",Beautiful Mountain Range inside the Chihuahuan Desert,15,"Bend, Oregon",5

There was a 20-30% chance of rain in forecast for that area and it did rain. Thank goodness for the rainfly! It was very windy and a cool (for Texas) mid 70s at night. Be prepared for triple digits in daytime. There are faucets to be used only as drinking water. There are plenty of restroom facilities with low lighting and a sink just for dishwashing. The Chisos Basin is known for mountain lions and bears but despite all the grilling we did, fortunately none appeared. There were vinegaroons and scorpions around campsite at night so I wouldn't advise flip flops. My husband and I have been to Basin pre-children in February and weather is extremely different-obviously extremely cold at night so check weather conditions for area. The Chisos Lodge is nearby with Wi-Fi for guests and a cute convenience store with anything you may have forgotten including food (sandwich stuff, sausage, etc.) and souvenirs. The kids had a wonderful experience. The highlight of the trip was that we spotted a bear from a far distance walking up a hill just before the fire conditions sign while winding into the basin. We were limited in time and decided to drive to some sites. (Don't miss the Hot Springs.) From Chisos Basin to Panther Junction there is a gas station.

Winter also may not be the time as there can be snow, ice or heavy rains, not an optimal hiking climate. We go in the fall. The Chisos Basin area is amazing. We have always stayed at the Lodge where the food is inexpensive and very good and the views are incredible. The deer come right up to the lodge as do other creatures. Bears we have seen from a great distance and thank goodness we have never seen mountain lions. There are hundreds of miles of trails in this park, many worth a second trip. Having seen other national parks this may not be the best in terms of scenery, but it has it's own special desert beauty. Be careful with water, as prolonged hiking in the desert can cause dehydration. In this climate, sweat just evaporates! For students of geography, this place is fascinating, as you can look around and note ancient volcanic peaks, volcanic ash, 'slips' from ancient earthquakes - and oh, yes, the marine fossils on the desert floor at over 5,000 feet elevation are worth noting,too.  Pictoglyphs anyone? They are there in a different part of Big Bend - but be sure to look UP- they are not alongside the trail. We never saw much in the way of crowds. I would be afraid to take small children as there is a lot of loose rock, and a lot of steep drop-offs. Most of the trails are not for sissies - but well worth the hike/climb.

Good opportunities to view wildlife, including that less often seen. Twice we saw a ringtail cat, both times at a pretty close distance and able to make a positive identification. We also watched a doe and fawn cleaning one another on the Lost Mine Trail. There aren't a lot of trails but the trails are beautiful and the trailheads are generally easy to access.

And the restaurant had an amazing view of the valley, the food was delicious, and the servers were cheerful. We used the lodge as a base camp for both mountain hikes and dessert hikes. Hiked to the canyon, the Rio Grande, and up the mountains where we saw signs to be cautions of mountain lions. We did not see any mountain lions but we did see some beautiful scenery. This park is certainly not ""on the way"" to anywhere else so you really have to be determined to go there. It was worth every mile we spend getting there.

Chisos Mountains,"As others have stated the attraction of this location is the mountains and the many trails available in addition it can be cooler up there so if it’s too hot to sleep in the lower parks than camp up here and drive down every day. The sites are kinda scattered and some are close together also I don’t think there is a level spot in the whole campground. No facilities except some bathrooms and a sink for washing your dishes. The drive up here can be a little daunting it’s not recommended for trailers or vehicles over 24 feet I think. There is a store and restaurant within ¼ mile walk from the campground. The camp hosts in the past couple years have been excellent, it’s pretty heavily patrolled by the rangers also as there has been instances of theft from time to time, they tell you not to leave anything of value in your tent, like what isn’t of value on a camping trip? They are serious about keeping your site clean and all food and water better be put in the bear box if you’re not in your site or they will take it and leave you a note about where you can retrieve it.","June 5, 2012",Good cenrtal location,83,"Dallas, Texas",4
Chisos Mountains,"This is a really nice place to visit and camp, if you enjoy remote mountain areas that are relatively easy to access (once you finally arrive). The Chisos Mountains of Big Bend is a wonderful cornucopia of interesting facts, overlooks, vantage points and points of interests. The climate is refreshingly mild during the Spring and most of the Summer. Unlike the Rio Grande Village area, it has a feeling of an oasis versus a desert landscape. The plant life is beautiful and quite different in certain spots. This is a really good area to camp; but, you've gotta book early... It's a nice place to take family (especially if they enjoy real-world nature) and can be a nice get-away for a couple. Also, nice lodge accommodations, must book early. Please note: This is definitely a remote and arid area, so please be aware of the various rules in place that govern a campsite. Also, please, please, please have all parties travelling to Big Bend Park to carry their drivers license, passport and/ or visa documents. All vehicles are checked by the border patrol. Have fun and enjoy the great outdoors!","May 28, 2012",Big Bend: Chisos Mountains,6,"Houston, Texas",4
Chisos Mountains,"My wife and i toured around Big Bend National park and the Chisos mountains this May and wow what a park. The scenery is truly stunning and varied and the sunsets are superb. We stayed at the Chisos Mt Lodge which was comfy and the service and food were very good.Its a great base for touring around. Lots of wildlife including bears. If you get the chance go there, you will not be disappointed.Barry & Nicola","May 20, 2012",Must see national park !,344,"Reading, United Kingdom",5
Chisos Mountains,"We spent 3 energizing and relaxing days and nights at Chisos Mountain Lodge in mid April this year. We loved the place from the very beginning of the 10 mile rugged drive into the 'basin' where the motel style accomodations are located. We found our Rio Grande Motel room clean, spacious,comfortable and it soon felt homely to us. The rooms don't have a television, wi-fi or a mobile/cell signal but this felt like a bonus in this 'truly away from it all' getaway destination. For those in dire need of contact with the outside world there were pay phones nearby and wi-fi and tv were available at the Lodge.Dinner there, as the sun set provided a beautiful view of 'the window' to gaze upon as we re-fuelled following our days adventure within the National Park. We took in and admired the amazing scenery as we walked a couple of the shorter trails and did some of the scenic drives. The Ross Maxwell Scenic Drive, which concludes with a short though energetic trail into Santa Elena Canyon is definitely not to be missed; get your camera at the ready! We particularly enjoyed sitting out on our porch in the evening with a fantastic view of the clear night skies. The amazing clarity of the stars is due to there being no light polution from anywhere for miles and miles around. We thought ourselves fortunate to see deer and a fox just feet from our porch bench. The National Park staff we encountered throughout the park were all helpful, knowledgeable and friendly.When the time came we were sad to leave this amazingly interesting and inspiring place; in the middle of the mountains...in the middle of the desert...","April 26, 2012",What an inspiring place to stay!,5,"Wigan, United Kingdom",5
Chisos Mountains,"Chisos campground was an ideal spot for the week. The temprature in late April ranged from mid to high 80's in the day to about 58 in the evening, very comfortable. This was a very central location for hikes to the window, lost mine, and emory peak. Bathrooms were readily available, however showers are 40 minutes away via vehicle, but it is camping, not humid so you can do without. The staff is very friendly. I highly encourgage attending the evening presentations at the the ampitheather, I enjoyed the discussion regarding the Texas Rangers, wish I could recall the fellow who presented as he was awesome.","April 26, 2012",Great week of Camping,27,"Houston, Texas",5

Chisos Mountains,"Spent 2 nights at Big Bend National Park and stayed at Chisos Mountain Lodge-the only lodge in the park and high up in the Chisos Mountains. Big Bend has four main drives-the Persimmon Gap to Panther Junction (not a lot to see unless you have 4WD); Panther Junction to Rio Grande Village (saw the Rio Grande and over into Mexico ); Panther Junction to Castelon and Santa Elena Canyon (the best drive with the most to see); and Panther Junction to Chisos Mountain Lodge ( impressive mountain views, shapes and hairpin turns). Enjoyed the solitude and desert beauty. Beautiful sunset through the ""Window"" up in the Chisos Mountains. I recommend this park, even though it is out of the way and you need to intentionally go there. We are not hikers but this is definitely a hiker's paradise. .","March 28, 2012","Awesome, Huge, Interesting, Little Known National Park",40,"Camp Pendleton, California",4
Chisos Mountains,Right in the middle of the park. Great way to experience the magnifigance of Big Bend! Beautiful! You can stay there. Book early. Rooms and camp sites go fast.

Chisos Mountains,"Discover the breathtaking landscape of Big Bend National Park first hand. The Rio Grande, Chihuahuan Desert, Chisos Mountains and Mexico's Sierra del Carmen Mountains provide the perfect backdrops for some truly incredible sunsets. Big Bend is also an excellent place for night sky-watching.The park can be expensive if you come unprepared, a breakfast buffet at the parks only restaurant is 20.00 a person. However, you can get by for about 20.00 a day if you pack a tent and bring along a cooler with plenty of lunch meat and lots of water. Entry into the park is 20.00 for 7 days. Camping is 14.00 a day and each campsite has it's own picnic table and BBQ pit. The campgrounds also provide restrooms and showers. We rated this experience 3.5 out of five, and would have gone higher had the motel not be gouging their guests with rates like that! Some of the best scenery can be found along the Rio grand and is only accessible for those with canoes or kayaks. The park offers three major canyons Santa Elena which is probaly the most dramatic for canoe and kayakers, Mariscal and Boquillas. During rainy periods these canyons offer class I - class IV rapids so be careful. Guide services are available by reservation only. More information can be found at the Panther Janction Visditors Center. If your traveling solo don't forget to get a backcountry camping permit which is required and must be turned back when when leaving the park. This is a good rule to follow in case there's an emergency. But the overall park itself was beautiful and certainly not crowded. As the Texas song goes, the stars at night, really are big and bright, a sight not seen anywhere else in North America! So for what it's worth, take time out to visit Big Bend National Park, it may be out of the way but this national park is sure to be put on your map!","February 20, 2012",Big Bend National Park,41,"Houston, Texas",3

Chisos Mountains,"My husband and I drove from Austin, Texas to Big Bend National park, Chisos Mts.It took us about 8 hrs so be willing to drive quite a ways. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time because the Chisos Mtn. lodge is the only placewhere you can stay in the park. I wish we could have stayed in the stone cottages but they were all filled. We .stayed in the Rio Grande motel type rooms and they were fine. It was great to have no T.V. but if you really need one you can rent one. Forever Resorts runs the reservation system and restaurant and do a fine job!","November 23, 2011","Out of this world""",94,"Columbus, Ohio",5

Chisos Mountains,"Camped there one night as part of a cross country road trip. It was MUCH cooler than the previous evening at Cottonwoods Campground in the park (much, much cooler). You need to see at least the overview of ""The Window"", if not hiking down to it. Our stay was made all the more exciting by a MOUNTAIN LION in the area (there were warnings to keep children close), which sadly we did not run into. Overall, a very pretty place to visit. The sunset was phenominal.","July 27, 2011",Wait... mountain lion???,171,South Jersey,5
Chisos Mountains,"Once you get to the Chisos Mountains, go to Chisos Basin, a large bowl (or basin) shaped valley. The terrain at the top is surprisingly different than the surrounding landscape. There are more trees, it's cooler, and much prettier. The majority of the mountains are extinct volcanos, if you're a geology buff. The only gas stations around the park are only at Panther Junction, Terlingua and Rio Grande Village. Never let your tank drop below the half mark, and carry plenty of drinking water.","November 3, 2008",Chisos Basin,136,dallas,5
