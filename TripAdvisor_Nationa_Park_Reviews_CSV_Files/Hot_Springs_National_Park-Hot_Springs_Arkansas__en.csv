Hot Springs National Park,"This park is unlike any national park we ever encountered before. It does have some beauty and charm but it's main attraction is showing us a piece of american history not often known. Actually I went to Hot Springs to visit Lake Hamilton and the national park was a perk. But I had expectations of finding numerous Onsens (ala Japan) in the park and city! Much to my surprise , when I got to the park it was quite something different. Also quite more informational. Hot Springs, especially the area now the national park, was 150 years ago and until near mid 1900s a combination Las Vegas and Mayo Clinic. Yes there were numerous bath houses and some of the last and most grand still stand but they were pure therapeutic/medicinal places. People went there with a doctors prescription. They were under a doctor and therapist care through a rigorous 2-6 month regime of treatments including baths in the hot springs water in a private tub. There were certain upscale niceties within the ""bath houses"" like gyms, music rooms, etc. but there were no hotel rooms. That's where the big hotels come in, also still there. All kinds of people came to Hot Springs from gangsters to celebrities and just regular people with lots of money. Accordingly all sorts of amusements for the not bath house time sprung up too..There are some enjoyable walking trails and a nice drive to take also.","October 9, 2019",Interesting and not well known part of American history,109,"Iowa City, Iowa",4

Hot Springs National Park,"Hot Springs has a great history for their bath houses.....many of which were patronized for therapeutic purposes.....in many cases people had prescriptions from their doctors for various 'treatments'. People traveled to Hot Springs from all over the country !Today, one of those bath houses has been beautifully restored and serves as the National Park Visitor's Center.As in most National Parks, the personnel were quite pleasant, helpful and informative.When visiting there one MUST take the guided tour of the premises.....very well done.","October 7, 2019",A piece of history,336,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5
Hot Springs National Park,"This was much more interesting than we thought it would be. The buildings are well preserved and beautiful. We took a guided tour that lasted about 30 minutes, very interesting. The displays are well done and really tell a story that I think few know. Make sure you walk up behind some of the buildings where the springs are still coming through, that water is HOT! Well worth the visit. Plus it's FREE. I highly recommend it.","October 6, 2019",History Preserved,5,Minnesota,5

Hot Springs National Park,The main street is a nice feeling of the good old days when luxury was appreciated and enjoyed. The movie and tour of the Visitor Center is worth the time. The only problem was the walking. There are no scooters to rent but their is wheelchair access. There are plenty of restaurants from which to choose. The mountain drive to the observation tower and lookoff are also peaceful and if it is not too crowded a pleasant experience. Bring an empty jug so that you can get some water from the fountain provided in town. I was very surprised at how hot the water was coming out of the spigot and also how clear. I expected some mineral deposits in the water but it was clear and tasted wonderful.,"October 1, 2019",The Good Old Days,34,Texas,4

Hot Springs National Park,My husband and I love visiting national parks but this one left us feeling o hum. Not sure why this is a national park. It is a series of bathhouses in the middle of town. The bath houses were interesting but once you did that and walked along the Grand Promemade all that is left is shopping the stores across the street. This should be designated a National Historic Site.,"September 21, 2019",Unique “national park”,41,"Aurora, Ohio",2

Hot Springs National Park,"My wife and I just spent three days at the national park and surrounding area and had a wonderful time. The area has so much history and the park's history is fascinating. We stayed at the Arlington Hotel, directly across the street from the park which made it so easy to access the trails. The park has 28 miles of trails, all well marked. There is a tower where one can access and see for miles around. Truly outstanding views in any direction, There is no admission charge to this national park, the smallest of all of our national parks. But there is a nominal charge to travel up to the top of the observation tower.We liked the trails and hiked several of them, the best being the Hot Springs Mountain trail which has nice overlooks.The visitor center is located in the former Fordyce Bath House on Central Ave. The National Park Service has done a great job here and the building is loaded with interesting exhibits from the heyday of the bath era - the 1910's through 1950's. All of the baths, lockers, parlors, etc. of the Fordyce Baths are lovingly restored and it is a fascinating tour of a bygone era. The rangers there are also quite knowledgeable and helpful. Two of the bath houses are still in use and we went to both of them and LOVED them. Great services, massages, baths, steam cabinets, all spotlessly clean despite what some snarky reviewers claim (who probably did not go in them). We enjoyed ourselves so much here. we plan to return time and time again.","September 15, 2019",Great History and Accessibility,631,"Naples, Florida",5

Hot Springs National Park,"If you are truly into the National parks, you'll hate this one. It is the only national park that is in a city. It is tourist hell. I wouldn't get in one of the bath houses for any money in the world. It's disgusting. I went many years ago and it wasn't this bad.

You can access the park from walking through the downtown and there are places you can touch the water which is very warm!

The town is old and needs some help, but the history that's here is spectacular. In the museum, they have three floors filled with lots of exhibits and displays. The Rangers are very informative and helpful. This is a part of Americana that needs to be preserved. It's worth the trip to Hot Springs, AR.

In the end it is mostly the historic bathhouses that are the draw.

Hot Springs National Park,"Hot Springs is the 7th National Park we have visited and I love them all! So diverse and rich in history and beauty! Hot Springs is very different from the others we have toured so far, but in a unique and charming way. Bath House Row is a study in a lavish era long passed, when medicinal bathing in the hot springs was the “In” thing to do. We really enjoyed a traditional hot bath at the Buckstaff Bath House and highly recommend this relaxing and nostalgic treat! The ranger talks were - as always - informative and interesting. The park’s visitors center is superb with four levels of historic exhibits in the former Fordyce Bath House. (Be sure to see the amazing stained glass ceilings on the 2nd and 4th floors!). Hiking around the park is great and just across the street are some eclectic shops and great restaurants. What’s not to love?!?!

The park is the bathhouses and the hiking trails behind it and across the street from the houses you have the town and all the shops. It really was a very different feeling than every other national park we have been too. Once we experienced seeing and being in the bathhouse, it really turned out to be a neat thing to do.

The bathhouse is pretty much exactly as patrons would have found it at the turn of the twentieth century. I really enjoyed checking out the rooms, the tubs and the pictures showing patrons and staff in the facilities. There is an informative film you can watch before touring the facilities. I know that it's sort of an artists community, but I have to admit that I was rather unimpressed with Hot Springs itself.

Hot Springs National Park,I was surprised to find that most of this NP was in the center of the town of Hot Springs. The central attraction seems to be bathhouse row - a series of grand bath houses kept alive by our taxpayer dollars. The self guided tour of the main one was good. There are a couple of hikes in the park both starting in town and outside of town. The trails were well maintained. Plus there is the ability to get water from the hot springs. The park service says that the water is around 4000 years old. Kind of cool. We grabbed a couple of bottles to take home. They will be great conversation pieces.

Hot Springs National Park,"This is a bit different than I’ve thought of a nat’l park because it is centered around a town — the historic mecca of Hot Springs AR. In its heyday of the early 1900s, Hot Springs was a thriving tourist mecca frequented by celebrities, professional athletes, gangsters, etc. Tho its visitors today are slightly less famous, the town is still a wonderful tourist draw. There are a number of small attractions, a theme park, horse racing in the season, quirky museums, numerous shops with a variety of merchandise, and abundant lakes and hiking trails for outdoor enthusiasts. The hiking trails are wonderful, picturesque routes with varieties for all skill levels. The fundamental draw back in the day was the hot baths which are still available in several venues and worth the experience It’s a great weekend getaway or a family vacation destination for those with a taste for the outdoors. The feel is small town, relaxed, and informal. Guests are made to feel welcomed. My visit was with women friends for sightseeing, photography, and shopping. We had a great time and will no doubt visit again.

There are also free guided tours usually twice daily that were very informative. Two old bathhouses continue to offer ""services"", allowing you to enjoy the thermal wonders of Hot Springs. The grounds are very well kept uo by the Park Service, including the drive to the overlook tower. This is a great Park to explore. You can see the basics in a couple hours, but I would recommend spending the best part of a day, having lunch, aand maybe endulging in the hot tub experience.","May 16, 2019",A different kind of National Park,148,"Estes Park, Colorado",5

Hot Springs National Park,"This is not your average national park - in fact, it seems almost the opposite of every national park we've been to, but it was well worth the stop! Hot Springs has an adorable little downtown area with shops/restaurants on one side of the street & a row of bathhouses on the other side (this side is the entire 'national park'). If you only have a little bit of time, go to the visitors center (the former Fordyce Bathhouse) to see the museum- it shows how the bathhouses used to look, etc. We were pleasantly surprised at how cute/quaint downtown Hot Springs was & we wish we had more than 45 minutes to spend there. Would've been a great place for lunch/dessert/window shopping. There's no entrance fee to the 'park' because it's just a downtown area.

The National Park Visitor's center gives you the history and you can tour a restored bath house while you walk along historic bath house row.

Don't miss the ranger-led tour to really get the feel of the place. A surprise for us was that Hot Springs was the birthplace of spring training. Since we were on a driving trip to Arizona to see the Cleveland Indians play spring ball, this was especially cool for us. There is a driving trail (although not part of the NP) that you can take to about 20 sites.

Hot Springs National Park,Might be the first National Park I have rated poorly. There just isn’t much here. Maybe it was the urban setting. It is located in the heart of the city. Just doesn’t feel like a National Park. In fact it really isn’t one. It is much more like a National Monument among the lines of the Liberty Bell or Hampton Plantation outside Baltimore. Only at least the matter has some open space and isn’t buried in traffic! Don’t bring an RV or camper! The state doesn’t help either. Signs to and from the park are terrible.

We ate at the Ohio Club, known for it's Reuben sandwich and it was wonderful. We also tried San Francisco Bread Co. The bread was awesome.

And the fact that its in a cute little town is also refreshing different, great coffee great brewery and food, spa treatment and shopping right next to an amazing natural resource. I visited in February and it was the perfect time! 60 degrees, bright sunny, wonderful breeze and on a Tuesday it was empty..the whole park too myself!! (not really but it felt like it). Visited the visitor center, really cool building and learning about the turn of the center medicine. Then took a run up and around Hot Springs mountain...miles of beautiful natural trails.

The architecture, tile, and windows are beautiful. We opted for the self-guided tour, but ranger led tours are available on the hour. There is also a 15 minute movie that plays on the half hour. All are free, but the park service does request donations. Pro tip: the hot spring water is free and can be put into purchased jugs by visitors. The government does not allow for it to be sold.

Hot Springs National Park,"The town of Hot Springs has lots of cute shops, & across the street is the park, which is right in town & is made up of the bathhouses. Due to time, we didn't get to take the trail up to the top of the hill, but we did walk around the visitor's center, pose for pics in the bathhouse rooms, & read many of the informational displays. We also didn't have time for the tour, but it seemed like it was informative & let you see more of the bathhouse than if you were to do it the self-guided way. What you MUST do is watch the video! It's about 20 minutes of the funniest/cheesiest step back into the late 80s/early 90s that you'll ever see, as you're walked through a bathhouse experience by a couple that ""visits"" the spa for the day, which is supposed to be similar to what you could've experienced back when the bath houses were in their heyday. I have no idea what a 2018 spa visit is like, but I'm assuming it's similar (just more expensive now) in keeping with tradition.

Hot Springs National Park,"Hot Springs National Park, being an urban park in the center of the city of Hot Springs, is very different from your typical larger national park preserving some special element of our natural environment. Although Hot Springs cannot compare to a Yellowstone, Zion or even a lesser known national park like Lassen Volcanic, it was still very interesting and better than I had expected.Walk Bathhouse Row along the eastern side of Central Ave and take in the opulent architecture and history of the therapeutic spas; be sure to stop in the old Fordyce Bathhouse, which is now the park’s visitor center, and watch the park film and tour the beautifully restored and comprehensive bathhouse museum full of period artifacts. Enjoy the many shops, restaurants and other commercial facilities across the road from Bathhouse Row and nearby that helped to make Hot Spring “Americas First Resort”. The mild climate and the therapeutic hot springs also made Hot Springs the training center of choice for professional baseball players starting in the late 1800’s and extending well into the 20th century. One will see many historical markers pointing out the connection between Hot Springs and many of baseballs legends.While primarily an urban park, Hot Springs National Park does have its share of natural beauty and points of interest. The surrounding mountains are part of the national park and offer scenic drives, overlooks and many hiking trails. On the most visited mountain, Hot Springs Mountain, there is an observation tower (fee) providing expansive views of this part of the Ozarks on a clear day. However, one does not need to even leave the urban center of the park to get a taste of the natural beauty of the area. Just north of Bathhouse Row is a cascading hot spring and running parallel to Center Ave behind Bathhouse Row is the peaceful 0.4 mile (0.6k) Grand Promenade offering views of the surrounding forested hills and additional springs. A stroll along the brick paved promenade is a must do activity that is best in the morning or evening.","December 16, 2018",A (Mostly) Different Kind of National Park,3757,"Avon, Ohio",4

We typically visit larger national parks, but decided to stay closer to home this time and I am so glad that we took a chance on HS. Yes, the park is small, but that makes it quaint and cozy and personal. There’s a little bit of everything here: natural areas to hike, stores to shop, ice cream parlors, drinks and dining, novelty shops! Lace up your boots and take a hike to see the gorgeous natural beauty that is in the mountains surrounding the downtown area. We hiked almost all of Sunset Trail (if you have to choose one section make it the Stonebridge Rd. section) which is rated hard. If you want easy trails stick to the ones behind the Visitors Center leading up to the Lookout Tower. Back in the downtown area there are many interesting little shops of all kinds that make a fantastic strip of shopping and dining. We so enjoyed just walking up and down and taking in all the sights. Eat at The Ohio Club (must be 21+ to enter), buy bath bombs from Bathhouse Soapery, enjoy drinks on the patio of The Arlington Hotel and soak in a hot spring bath at Quapaw. Again, my husband and I were skeptical about the bath houses, but it really is a neat experience and just adds to the overall feel of your visit! We paid $55 for a couples 20 minute private bath with added bath salts. So glad we did! Also, there are several public water stations where you can fill bottles with spring water. Love this! We refilled our water bottles all weekend as one station was less than 100’ from our lodging, Quartz Street Cottage (air b’n’b that was fantastically clean and tidy and a mile and a half away from downtown area which was a quick easy walk), which I highly recommend for your overnight stay.

There is a road to the top for those unable to walk up the mountain. It’s just about 0.5 miles to walk. There is a lovely Grand Promenade that runs along the foot of the mountain behind the Main Street. It’s a pretty little walk also. The town itself is full of cute shops, restaurants and the historic bath houses where the well to do cane in the past for bathing and therapy.

Hot Springs National Park,"I visited Hot Springs National Park on the Fourth of July. It was hot, sunny, and crowded. The free parking garage on Exchange Street was full, so I parked in the paid parking lot next to it. First I toured all the floors and rooms of the Fordyce bath hour/visitor center/museum. There was so much to see! Then I watched the films about the park. I was at the visitor center for about and hour and 15 minutes. There are free bathrooms just outside the visitor center. After that, I hiked up the Peak Trail (20 hot, steep, wonderful minutes) to the Hot Springs Mountain Tower and pavilion scenic overlook. Then I hiked down the Shortcut Trail/Dead Chief Trail (total of 15 minutes of rocky, downhill hiking), visited the air-conditioned NPS gift shop, felt the (super-hot!) water from the thermal fountain, and got advice on other trails back at the visitor center. If you want to hike the West Mountain Trails, get their color-coded map! I did the green (Canyon)-blue (West Mountain)-yellow (Oak) loop in about an hour and a half.

Hot Springs National Park,"Hot Springs NP is a unique park with a rich history. It boasts 47 natural hot springs and was the 1st natural resource set aside as federally protected land, 40 years prior to the creation of the 1st official NP (Yellowstone). It is small and does not compare in size nor terrain with most NPs. However, it still has a lot to offer. We visited the park (#23) as part of our quest for all 59. Following is a summary of our 2.5 day trip. LOCATION - The park is located in the historic district of the city. Although unusual for a NP, it is also extremely convenient. There are plenty of hotels, restaurants, shops and other activities available all within walking distance. We stayed at The Waters (hotel) which was in a perfect location, across the street from the park visitor center and access to hiking trails. BATH HOUSE ROW - There are eight historical bath houses along BHR, with only two still functioning as bath houses. The rest of have been re-purposed for other uses. We enjoyed visiting several, described below: FORDYCE is the NP visitor center. The upper floors of the facility feature a completely restored bath house with interpretive signs. You can take a ranger led (11a, 2p) or self guided tour of the 1st - 3rd floor exhibits. We arrived after 2pm, so enjoyed the self guided tour. It's' very interesting and well worth the time. Allow at least 1 hr for the self- guided tour. QUAPAW offers a more modern style bath house experience where you can choose between private ($30 for 20 min) or public ($20 unlimited time) bath. It also offers other spa-like experiences. It's kind of an ala carte menu where you can build your own experience. Appt are not required for the public baths, but are needed for all other services. Our family members each chose different options (public, private, and stream cave), and enjoyed all. BUCKSTAFF offers a more historical bath house experience, where visitors follow a multi-step process. SUPERIOR is the only micro brewery in a NP and the only brewery in the world using thermal spring water in it's beers. PROMENADE - This is a very nice brick walkway that follows along above BHR. It is great for all skill levels. We enjoyed the self-guided phone tour using our cell phone. Instructional signs can be found at either end of the Promenade. There are several locations along this walk where the springs are flowing naturally (most have been capped). For an added bonus, take some checker game pieces with you! There are several checker boards located near the Reserve St entrance. This is also the best place to connect to the hiking trails. HIKING - The NP hiking trails are primarily limited to those on the mountain behind BHR. You will not find endless miles of trails, but can enjoy several interconnecting trails which can be combined for a nice 5 - 7 mile day. We hiked down into the gorge along the river or up to the ridge for some nice views of the surrounding area. The trails are well maintained and well marked. The terrain is challenging enough to get the average tourist's heart rate up. Lots of shaded areas, but can still get hot so take lots of water. TOWER - Although not managed by the NPS, the tower is located about 1.5 mile up the mountain. It is accessible by hiking or by driving. You can also sign up for a ranger led tour to the tower (9:30a, 11a). We chose to hike on our own, using the Dead Chief Trail (0.3mi) to the Shortcut (0.2 mi). A sign at the beginning of the trail warned that this was the steepest of all trail leading up the mountain (Of course it was). It was 95 deg when we hiked up and I'm pretty out of shape, but we made it. We were all thrilled to find A/C inside the tower!! There is a nice picnic area just prior to arriving at the tower (hike or drive). Once at the tower, you'll find restrooms, water, and a good sized store/souvenir shop. There is a fee ($8-12y up, $4.5-11y under) to go up in the 216 ft tall tower. For the hardy, you can also take the stairs...no thank you! The elevator ride is on the exterior of the tower, so you see everything as you go up. If you're freaked out by this, just close your eyes for the ride. At the top, take time to enjoy both the indoor area with a lot a great info boards and outdoors with great views of the surrounding area. This park was a pleasant surprise for us. We didn't expect much since it was located in a city and could not offer the grand adventures found at many of our previous park visits. However, we all agreed (even our teenager) that it far surpassed our expectations.","July 21, 2018",Hot Springs NP - Worth the trip.,179,Ohio,5

They weren't serving outside, but did take out.

Hot Springs National Park,"I overall liked this park. It is located in the center of town- right across the street from Hot Springs downtown area. I personally didn’t understand why it was considered a National Park. It was very focused on the human history, not the natural history of the hot springs. You also have to pay to get in the bath houses, but overall I really enjoyed it here!","July 14, 2018",Very interesting but...,9,,3

Hot Springs National Park,"I've always been fascinated by hot springs, and have always wanted to check this out. I'm so glad I did. The National Park is awesome, and they are doing so much to ensure the preservation of this site. The Fordyce Bath House is the home to the official visitor's center and museum. Definitely worth a tour of each level. The museum gives you a glimpse of a bygone era, and the artifacts are interesting. I'm not sure if the meticulous preservation added to a weird vibe they place gave me, but I only felt this odd/creepy vibe at Fordyce. I've tried to do some research since this about hauntings, etc., and can't find anything, so maybe it's just me. The Grand Promenade is worth walk. If you are visiting in the summer, go when it's cool, not mid-day. The drive up the mountain is a must! Wonderful views of the town below and the surrounding Ouachita (pronounced Wa-Chi-Ta) Mountains. It is amazing the springs are still free for visitors to use for drinking water. Just make sure you use glass or BPA free bottles as the water is, well, hot...very hot! Lastly, make sure to visit the brewery.

Hot Springs National Park,"We visited HSNP this past week and could see why most visit this beautiful town/Park in the fall season. The heat during the summer can make it more challenging to complete all of our tourist goals. We enjoyed touring the Fordyce Bath House (Visitor Center for the park), hiking the Grand Promenade, and Goat Rock trail. We left our puppy in our air conditioned camper for most of our trip but did take her with on the Goat Rock trail. Even though we left early around 9:45, we should have left earlier as the outside temp very quickly exceeded 95+ degrees. Thankfully, we brought water and the trail was mostly shaded. The mineral water is delicious!!! Just let it cool off after filling your containers outside the north and south side of the park. There is 15min water loading parking and a free parking garage a couple blocks away from the park. There is metered parking too which takes nickels, dimes, and quarters. We parked in the meter parking. This National Park would be easier to tour for young children/elderly in the cooler months due to increased risk of heat exhaustion with the heat index during the summer.","June 30, 2018",Beautiful despite the heat,5,"Tea, South Dakota",5

Make sure to visit the bathhouses on Central Ave.--very rich in history. They are still operational spas. Superior Bathhouse has been turned into a craft brewery---only one in any of the National Parks. The IPA was very good. Food service as well.

Central Ave also has many shops/boutiques and attractions (we loved Bubbalu's restaurant right across from visitors center). Drive up Hot Springs Mountain to Mountain Tower where you take an elevator many stories up to view the city and surrounding beauty.

The only other thing I would suggest is to see the public fountains and watch as locals fill up barrel after barrel of free spring water. One lady said she drives over an hour a way to do this.

Most of the springs have been covered to prevent contamination, but there are a few you can touch or even take a bottle with you.The other major parts of the Park are the Grand Promenade, a paved walk on the hillside behind the other major part of the Park, Bath House Row, seven old, architecturally bath houses constructed over the hot springs. One of the bath houses still operates, several have been repurposed, several are just shells and one - Fordyce - operates as the Park Visitor Center. It has been restored to what it looked like when it operated and there are some small exhibits and short movies there.","May 24, 2018",Small park with amazing springs,361,"Arlington, Virginia",4

Hot Springs National Park,"Hot Springs is unlike any national park I’ve been to. It’s focus is on the hot Springs and the bathhouses that people flocked to in the early 20th century. Stroll along bathhouse row and stop in the Fordyce Bathhouse which is now the visitor center. You will get a sense of what the old bathing regimes were all about. You can also walk the Grand Promenade and see the actual Springs, most enclosed in protective boxes, but some still freely flowing down the hillside. There is a campground and some trails as well. Best of all, this park has free admission with many places for free parking. ","May 8, 2018",A Vintage Urban Park ,240,"Noblesville, Indiana",5

Hot Springs National Park,"First, we went without having any preconceived notions about what we'd find in Hot Springs NP, which worked out well. I noticed from some other comments that people seemed surprised this was not a vast park. The Parks Service serves to protect national heritage and that can be a monument, a series of monuments (like the National Mall or the C&O Canal in Washington, DC), etc. Hot Springs NP has a visitor center in the Fordyce Bathhouse, which gives a person as sense of what the bathhouse culture was like decades ago, and how hot springs are formed. The building itself is exquisite from the outside. The neighboring bathhouses are also fascinating from the outside. And yes, the town butts right up against it all - which we found fun. I loved the people watching. We went on an Easter weekend, the weather was gorgeous and people seemed in good spirits. The buildings across the street also have some fascinating architecture if you look up beyond the ground floor. The park itself stretches 8 square miles Near the bathhouses is an entrance to the park (in between the bathhouses and the Arlington Hotel) where you can see some hot 'springlets' and do a series of short hikes (0.2 miles each). There are also spots where you can drive for views - up each of the 'mountains' (there are several spots to stop on the Western Mountain and there is a tower on the other side. We walked up to it but didn't go in. If you are more ambitious, we also did a longer 9 mile hike, which started at the top of the Western Mountain loop (free parking). **We used GPS but also referred to the free map we got from the NPS staff at the Fordyce Bathhouse.** From the parking lot you follow the Sunset Trail west, and then gradually loop north and east, until you reach the Cedar Glades Road. From there you walk downhill back into town, passing some beautiful homes and lilac trees. After a short walk on the main road (where we stopped for a iced latte), we walked back uphill, taking the path of a carriage road from the 1800s, winding our way back to the car. We had a grand time hiking, finding many beautiful blooms, enjoying the views. Sure you aren't far from town but you do get away from it all.

Across from them all sorts of tourist attractions have sprung up.There is a free public parking garage that is a short walk to bath house row.If you want to go up in the watch tower it’s an extra free as it’s not run by the park service.Overall it was fine but I guess I’m just used to the National Parks being nature focused.,"March 22, 2018",Enjoyable morning!,17,"Durham, North Carolina",4

As well, there are multiple hot and cold water taps throughout the city making water bottle refills convenient. Parking wasn't too hard to find as there was some on-street parking right next to the visitor's center. That being said, we went on a cold February day and the place was almost packed, so if you're planning on going in the summer months I would suggest planning ahead.

(A recommendation from one of the park staff). We had a very pleasant and peaceful walk on one of the trails. The trail was listed as moderately difficult. Easy enough for someone who is fit, but not suitable for anyone with difficulties walking. For the more outdoorsy type there are hiking trails of more distance and challenges. As the park guide had told us and google maps confirmed the traffic was backed up on the road to the summit with the tower so we opted to only drive up to the one summit.

Hot Springs National Park,"Honestly, the best part about the “park” was visiting the Fordyce Bathhouse (aka the visitors center). This is the smallest National Park and truthfully one of the oddest and most unique parks. The town itself is part of the park. We drove up to the viewing tower and decided not to go up the tower ($8 for adults). We drove the little loop up the hill and got to see the hot spring capsules and the views of the city. That was about all that was up there. The little town was the best part. Definitely a unique National Park... unlike any others, that’s for sure. Overall, it was fun to go and see it but the self guided tour of the Fordyce Bathhouse was the best.We visited in December which is one of the slowest times of the year. We were told spring and summer is WAY busier, just something to keep in mind. Also, in December obviously a lot of the trees and vegetation is dead...so I don’t think the views were as beautiful as they could be.","December 7, 2017",Loved the Fordyce Bathhouse,47,"Seattle, Washington",3

Hot Springs National Park,"Hot Springs, Arkansas is a step back into time. The elaborate buildings are a reminder of a time when life was slower and, for a certain class of people, indulgent. The wealthy came in droves to be pampered and treated for various ailments, real and imagined. The visitor center has guided tours twice daily but you can take a self-guided tour at any time. The facilities are amazing and the architecture will astound you. Stroll the main street, visit the major hotels, hike the promenade and local trails. Accommodations range from elegant and expensive to simple and budget-minded.

Hot Springs National Park,"We were heading to national parks in Texas and New Mexico and as this was not far off our travel route, we decided to spend two nights here and visit Hot Springs National Park. We ""took the waters"" of the springs at Quapaw Bathhouse, took The Grand Promenade Walk and drove the Mountain Tower Drive (the one way road up was closed due to construction so the one way road down was made a two way drive). We took the elevator up to the top to get a 360 degree view of the Hot Springs area. Bathhouse Row was mostly covered by foliage but there were a few scenic views to the west. The open top viewing area contained a number of wasps so if you are allergic to stings, be careful. The lower viewing area was enclosed, air conditioned and contained a history of Hot Springs. We received the senior national parks pass rate of $5 each otherwise it would have been $8 each. So we did all of what we wanted to do in this national park. There are other things for a family to do but my impression is that the bathhouses are for adults and not children. This national park is like no other we have visited, but we did visit it.For us the most interesting sights were the bathhouses on Bathhouse Row. Two still offer baths and other services. One houses the visitor center for the park (Fordyce) and includes a tour of what the building contained in the previous century. Another houses the national park store (Lamar) and, I believe, another houses a brewery (Superior).As mentioned above, we bathed at The Quapaw. We arrived there about ten minutes after it opened (10am) and were number one on the wait list. It was almost an hour before our number was called. We just wanted the basic communal bath so the cost was $20 each. There are four pools ranging from 95 to 98 to 102 to 104 degrees. The 98 seemed best suited for us. You can stay there for as long as you want and can even get lunch whilst in the bath area. We decided to get dressed before we ate there.Remember to bring a bathing suit and flip flops (they provide towels). This experience was the best part of our national park visit.","October 8, 2017",On our list of National Parks to see,130,"Williamsburg, Virginia",4

You could pay to go up to the lookout tower but we wanted free views so headed back down. The walk along the Bathhouse Row - the Grand Promenade - was very beautiful. The preserved bathhouses look like museums and the garden behind the row of bathhouses is beautiful. Hot springs dot the park. You can drink from the hot springs where spigots are available. The water was really delicious, both warm and cold. I highly suggest giving yourself time to explore Fordyce Bathhouse where the main visitor center is.

After driving back down, I was able to find parking in the city parking garage and quickly walked to the NPS site. Walking down bathhouse row, I saw a number of the different bathhouses that are still in existence, although some have been repurposed as a restaurant, an art house, a working bathhouse, and the NPS bookstore.The visitor center, located in Fordyce Bathhouse, offers visitors the opportunity to walk around a bathhouse that is no longer used but has a variety of the equipment and furnishings that were originally in the bathhouse. The site has multiple floors as well as an area for viewing the NPS film for the site. Additionally, this is where you can get information from the Park Rangers.It takes a good hour to hour and a half to really enjoyed the Fordyce Bathhouse and to read the various placards that discuss the different elements of the bathhouse.Additionally, one can walk down bathhouse row and see the few remaining bathhouse.

And of course do not forget to bring your glass bottles / containers to fill the yummy hot springs water to take with you :) there are two springs in the city that offer the water to you cold instead of hot (you will have to ask for those locations as they are not on the main walking path).

Hot Springs National Park,"Hot Springs National Park surrounds the north end of the city of Hot Springs. We spent lots of time in this park during our three day stay in Hot Springs. We took the very well organized Fordyce Bathhouse tour. The bathhouse history is fantastic. There are several different parts to the National Park. You will most likely enter the ""park"" starting with the Bathhouse Row. Anything from the Bathhouse row side (located on Central Avenue) and you will know you are in Hot Springs National Park. You will see bunch of bathhouses next to each other which all belong to the National Park. Anything opposite of Bathhouse row is Hot Springs City. Hot Springs National Park is best known for the 47 hot springs that come out of the Hot Springs Mountain at an average 143° Fahrenheit. Hot Springs National Park is the only unit of the national park system that is mandated to give away its primary natural resource (natural water from the hot springs) to the general public.About:Hot Springs National Park was once known as Hot Springs Reservation. It was set aside in 1832 to protect the Park's primary resource, the hot springs. This type of Reservation was an early version of the National Park idea. Hot Springs was the first area in the United States to be set aside for its natural features. After Yellowstone was formed in 1872, Hot Springs was managed with it. In 1916 the National Park Service was formed and in 1921, Hot Springs Reservation changed its name to Hot Springs National Park, making it the 18th National Park in the Service.","July 20, 2017","Gorgeous park located inside Hot Springs, Arkansas",1599,"Hawthorn Woods, Illinois",5
Hot Springs National Park,"Hot Springs is worth a visit but I'm satisfied with my one trip and done. Good experience overall and it's easy to navigate. A bit underwhelming. Park staff were nice and they were helpful but due to its nature it feels a bit disjointed. If this is going to have National Park status, it should be more interactive. It's basically more like a museum visit with a bunch of tourist shops. I'd like to have felt like I was more in the era (early 20th century) than just looking at it. You should go see it, but you don't need to plan a week around it. ","July 16, 2017",Worth seeing once,6,"Silver Bay, Minnesota",4

Hot Springs National Park,"Wanting to visit something worthwhile in all 50 states, National Parks tend to rate high on our list, and this was our must do in Arkansas. Other reviewers question its status as a National Park, which is completely understandable. Instead of mountains and trees and other natural vistas, when you ""arrive"" (per your GPS) you find yourself on a street corner in a small, dated town. The first building you see with the National Park Service sign in the yard is locked. The thing to see there is people filling receptacles with fresh water coming out of a fountain.Walk down the street and you'll find another building that's marked with the National Park signage, and that's where it'll all begin to make sense. The Fordyce Bath House has been restored by the National Park Service (interesting story about the buildings fixtures and furniture and how they got them back) and while you can tour yourself (and therefore go at your own pace) I highly recommend the free ranger tour. The building itself and the tubs/showers/machines would not have made any sense in terms of how and why they were used, and why people traveled great distances to come here for several weeks of doctor-prescribed treatments (this wasn't a ""spa"" or get-away) but you would enjoy the beautiful stained glass!While not a part of the National Park system (again, the ""boundaries"" of this park are unlike those at other parks) I would also recommend visiting a bath house that still welcomes visitors. You don't need a doctor's prescription, you can join a public pool or get a private room with a hot-tub sized bath, and you get to immerse yourself in the waters for which this place was famous, as well as the history therein represented.

One of them (Fordyce) is the park Visitors Center, one (Lamar) is the park Emporium, another (Ozark) is the park Cultural Center, the Superior is now a brewery and restaurant, and the other two (Hale and Maurice) have been restored and are awaiting new tenants. Across the street are shops, restaurants, and tourist attractions galore. All around the park are areas where people can walk (or stroll, if that's more your speed). The Grand Promenade, located directly behind Bathhouse Row, is a bricked walkway that spans the entire length of Bathhouse Row, and offers beautiful scenery and a sense of nature while still being only a stone's throw from downtown. A little farther out are hiking trails. All of the trails are moderate, with a bed of pine needles and fall leaves to walk on. All in all, it's worth the trip. This would be a place to enjoy with the whole family, or just as a quick couple's getaway. And, you can take your dog, too. Dogs are welcome on a leash on all the trails in the park.","March 30, 2017",Definitely a must!,16,"Odessa, Texas",5

Walking Bathhouse row is very interesting, the buildings are all architecturally beautiful! The kids enjoyed working on their junior ranger books, which lead them all over the main parts of the park. We walked the Grand Promenade above the street. There are trails, unfortunately, we didn't get a chance to hike any of them. We did drive up to the North Mountain Look out and then back down.

Hot Springs National Park,"Our national parks range from Yellowstone to the Grand Canyon to civil war battlefields. Hot Springs National Park is a tricky one to rate. It's not the most scenic, it's right in the middle of the city of Hot Springs, and the much focus seems to be inside (gift shops and bathhouse) rather than outside. However, it does have an interesting history as well as some nice trails. It's a shame that the gift shop was so crowded but we didn't see anyone on the trail for a few hours.We used the gift shop for the restrooms and resisted paying extraordinary prices for unnecessary items. We have no need for a shot glass, walking stick, or a glass bowl that says ""Hot Springs National Park"". We chose instead to hit the trails and take photos to keep as memories of being here together. Tips for visiting:1. Plan a hike. There are all kinds of trails throughout the park.2. Pick up some sandwiches and chips in town for a nice relaxing picnic.3. Take the ranger led Fordyce Bathhouse tour.4. Visit the Hot Springs National Park website for ranger led hikes and events. There's a wide range of activities that will help make your visit enjoyable and memorable.5. Avoid the gift shop. It's crowded and overpriced...and you're in a park! 6.

Nothing can take away from viewing the actual springs or driving up the mountain to see the beautiful scenery; however, I have not been impressed with the actual park service during any of my visits. This year was worse than ever before. We went into the visitor center about 5 minutes before the scheduled time for the film. Having been there before we did not spend any time looking at the exhibits or touring the facilities. We waited, along with about 15 other people over 15 minutes for park personnel to start the film. One gentleman in the group went to ask about the film viewing. He reported back to the rest of us that there was only one person at the desk and that person could not leave because of other visitors. So, we waited another 5 minutes, but decided to just leave. When we left there were two people behind the front desk. One was talking on the phone and the other one did not seem too concerned about getting the film started.

Hot Springs National Park,"My wife, friends and I decided to take a little vacation to Hot Springs, Arkansas to see the Bathhouses and more importantly, one of our nation's National Park. On the first day, we were disappointed because the National Park was not well identified (the signage was poor) especially to the tourist. After driving numerous miles, we finally realized that the National Park was in the center of town either left or right . The second day, we went back and took a left turn (West) and went into the park. It was not very impressive as the Park was just a road with one sign. The road had houses on both sides of it. There was no visible wildlife to admire. After the left hand turn, we took the right hand turn which was a lot better. The drive was beautiful. So much so, we had a lunch packed and had a picnic in the rest area. It was very scenic. The city of Hot Springs was visible from this scenic stop.Even though disappointed, I recommend visiting Hot Springs National Park.

Hot Springs National Park,"Some reviews bash this park because it's a city and not just vast forests. All I can say is keep an open mind. The history according to guides is that the area was protected in 1832 by the government as a reservation. If true this makes it the first national park. Later it was re-designated as a national park. With that in mind, it's important to realize that the government stepped in to regulate it's use, but it was heavily used until 1960's. The main draw to the park is the history of the healing waters and the lifestyle users experienced. There isn't a ton to see but it's easy to see everything memorable in a day. Highlights- the park is free, the local food is good, and you can get a feel for the bathing medical practice pretty easy.

The park does a good job of explaining the geology and exploring the social history, as demonstrated by the bathhouses.

We also watched a short video. Later when the rain had stopped we rode to the tower (admission to go up) and then up the road to hike a 3 mile loop that consisted of 2 trails plus parts of 2 others to get back to our car without walking up the road. We had to figure this out ourselves. Nice trails. Wish the weather had been better so we could have had better views.

Hot Springs National Park,"So let me say that before I visited Hot Springs National Park, I wasn't sure I'd enjoy it, but I'm glad I did. I think Hot Springs is rather unique in that not so long ago, it was actually still functioning not long ago. Also, it was initially built for profit unlike other National Parks such those that were nature-made. At any rate, when you make it to the downtown Hot Springs area, be sure to park in the free lot--as you exit toward the road, you'll find yourself almost directly in front of the park. You can tour one of the historic bathhouses that has 2 or 3 floors open for touring where you'll see changing areas for men and women, a gymnasium for fitness, and a massage parlor. If you participate in the NPS Passport program, be sure to get your stamp there at the Fordyce House and check out the park store in the Lamar Bathhouse, as they have a stamp there as well. You can purchase souvenirs there such as a embroidered towels, quartz specimens from the Arkansas mountains, and souvenior jugs and jars that you can use to fill with water from the hot springs at one of the nearby filling stations. As you walk the row, you'll notice other buildings that were once bathhouses--some still offer hot baths, while others have been converted to other things. Behind the row of bathhouses, there are areas to hike, and you can see the hot, steaming waters rushing through the aqueducts. Also, there are scenic mountain trails you can drive for those who are interested, though I didn't check any of them out. I really enjoyed this national park more than I thought I would given it's commercial beginnings. If you're in the area, why not check out what once made Hot Springs such a popular tourist destination? This park has no fees for those traveling on a budget. It's right in the heart of town with antique shops, stores, and restaurants, and you can spend as little as an hour or as many as you'd like. :)","September 5, 2016",A Unique National Park!,242,"Woodbridge, Virginia",5
Hot Springs National Park,"My Husband and I want to see as many national parks as we can while we are here on this earth. I guess, for me, it wasn't what I was hoping for. Perhaps the rain had a lot to do with it. It's not Smokey MNP or Rocky MNP if that is what you are looking for. I knew from the start that it wasn't, however, I was hoping for a little more. It is mostly shops and bathhouse row, restaurants, etc. There are some mountains that you will see. We soldiered on through rain and went up the mountain tower, took the 3 mile mountain loop and another mile mountain loop. We went across a mountain and back. Not a National Park where you can drive thru a mountain parkway.So it depends on what you are looking for.....","August 31, 2016",It's Okay,48,"Dayton, Ohio",3

Hot Springs National Park,"This apparently is the smallest National Park in the country, but is certainly worth a visit, as it is a very interesting area. There are various bathhouses to see and a couple where you can still actually take a bath and spa treatments if you want to. The bathhouses that are not still in use are laid out as museums and they are very interesting to view. The Maurice bathhouse they are trying to raise money to renovate. This area in its hey day was obviously used by wealthy citizens who came here specifically for the baths, apparently to treat various illnesses. Nicely done and glad we spent the day here.

Hot Springs National Park,"On the first day, I took my scouts here to tour an old bath house (recommended by an employee at the hotel where we stayed). It was full of unique history and we had a chance to see how things were actually set up from the steam room, massage room, thermal soaks, relaxation, locker rooms, gym, etc. I hope I am using the correct terminology on some of the rooms. This is located in the Visitor's Center and is a free self-paced tour. You can also watch a video. They also have bathrooms in the basement.We also went outside to the Hot Springs display and the girls enjoyed that (seeing water coming out of the mountain and steam coming from the water). They had a chance to touch the water and feel how hot it was coming out of the mountain.Before we left (a few days later), I took them near the base of the mountain tower entrance to fill their water bottles. Another employee at the hotel told me that one has cold water and the rest of them have hot water. Some of us drank our water there (hot and humid) and refilled our bottles. So refreshing and what a way to top off our trip!!Take some gallon water jugs to get some spring water.","August 17, 2016",Enjoyed,17,Louisiana,4

The trails offered some hills and some relatively flat hikes to your preference. Great views in some locations. The National Park is in the middle of the city so don't expect isolation. There were people hiking who seemed to be local residents who were simply ""walking"" the trails for exercise. So the hiking experience is different then say a Great Smoky Mountains hike.

Hot Springs National Park,"This park is snug at the bottom end of Bath House Row, across from the old Arlington Hotel. It's a tidy little park with plenty of neat walkways and access to the promenade at the top of the cliff. There are a couple of scenic nooks with landscaped hot water springs bubbling into the small pools. Some walkways are cut into the cliffs to get to the top. Lots of good picture opportunities. Can take your Fido with you, and cleanup bags are often provided at the park entrances. Parking can be a problem as the whole bathhouse row is in a narrow valley between two ridges, and the bottom of the valley is tightly built up. It's a nice little place to roam for an hour or so.

We enjoyed a nice private mineral bath at Quapaw Bathhouse(fee) and then went up the mountain to the observation tower (fee to go up).

And it was quite warm there a week ago.We stayed on the park trails up to the tower, then used the roads to get to the top and the lookout to the east ( from the look out, there really isn't a trail up the last 100 yds or so to the highest point. We ended up hiking back by way of the Goat rock trail ( the rock itself has a very anice view to the south/ southeast).a couple hours later, we found our way down to the Cold springs near Happy Hollow and downed a few then filled up our water bottles to go with nice clear cold refreshing spring water.There are several places at the lower elevations to get free spring water (cold spring at the north end, and hot springs in the middle and south end.

Hot Springs National Park,"As a volunteer in the park, I see a lot of people on daily. This is a wonderful park, but you must take your time to explore and understand the history behind this park. No this isn't Yellow Stone or like many other National Parks, this was the very first land set aside for the recreation and enjoyment of the people in 1832. In reality, it is the very first National Park and predating Yellow Stone by 40 years. The national park service did not start until 1916, Hot Springs was renamed Hot Springs National Park in 1921. The Visitor's Center conducts guided tour daily at 11AM and 2 PM, we explain the reason for the park and why the land was set aside and the park is FREE to visit. Don't come here expecting to see geysers, there are 47 seeping springs emerging from the earth at 143 degrees.

Hot Springs National Park,Hot Springs state park was a great place to explore. We stayed just on the outskirts of town and went over a holiday week end. It was a bit crowded but parking was free because it was a holiday week end. Definitely stop in the visitor center. There is a bathroom in there and we picked up some maps and other information on places we wanted to visit. Bath houses were fun and the kids were fascinated by the hot springs. If you stop in one of the Fordyce Bathhouse there are rangers from the national park who can help you if you want to hike. Since I was with my friends and her kids (one who is only 2) we opted only for the trails that were on a paved surface. Pay attention though. We totally missed the Hot Water Cascade. It is off to the left almost as soon as you pass through the two pillars with Eagles on top. Be careful if you let the kids touch the water because it is HOT. You could even feel the heat radiating off of the water in the summer. I would love to see it in the cooler weather when you see the steam coming off the water. We found a great place to picnic just outside the campground in the National Park. Plenty of shops and treasures up and down Central Avenue.

Things have a come a long way! There is a spot outside where you can see a spring. The majority of spots are covered. The water is 143 degrees so don't touch. This is a half a day national park. History is interesting. We did a very short drive up Hot Springs Mountain, more like a hill, Stopped to look at the view but did not do the tower. The visitor center and museum are free, something I don't understand. The observation tower at the top of the mountain has a fee. Wouldn't consider this a destination but if you are in the area check it out. We are on a quest to see all the national parks. Lots of stuff to do near by.","April 13, 2016",The smallest national park.,273,"Atlanta, Georgia",4
Hot Springs National Park,"We traveled to Hot Springs National Park (key words National Park) to enjoy the springs. We were assured the ""springs"" were in the National Park. What a joke.

Hot Springs National Park,"Its a walk through museum- Free of charge- Operated by the State Park. At the reception desk sits a park ranger, with friendly advice about the entire area (like which route to take up the mountain to get the best view!), an area map, and paper cups to facilitate your taking a drink from the fountain in the Promenade. The building itself is well maintained, and as you walk through, you'll find historical moments, scientific/geographical info, and an opportunity to look at where the spring that fed water into the facility comes up through the ground. You'll also find info on how brown people were poorly treated in the spa hay day (underpaid/overworked, not allowed to use the facility) and how those that had physical challenges (such as MS) or mental challenges were ""helped"" by water therapy. The area is creepy- in our book. And when we returned home and spoke to a friend about our visit, they felt the same way while visiting. Slightly disturbing. But, good to understand these things, and how far some things have come. I would definitely start here first- because the park ranger should be able to give you information that will help you enjoy your trip, and answer any questions you might have about the area.

Hot Springs National Park,"Beautiful scenery, beautiful campground, but why beside a major road is the big question. The valley location beside a wonderful, clear creek couldn't be a nicer setting for a campground but the adjacent road that sees 24 hour traffic, that includes timber-hauling transports and every other kind of noise generating vehicle imaginable is just too disturbing to make this an enjoyable location for anyone with a minimal capacity to distinguish sound. To make things worse, the road is on a significant slope, so vehicles are working pretty hard to get up the hill and also stopping pretty vigorously to slow on the way down. Needless to say, the aggressive drivers create even more noise than necessary. There are no reservations offered for this campground so it's first come, first served. After a bit of searching, we found a vending machine that spits out reservation tickets after a bit of number punching and credit card inserting. Visits are good for as long as 14 days but the noise may drive you away after 14 hours. There are also no staff available for help. There were 3 campsites occupied by volunteer campground hosts, with 2 off at any one time, and no answer at the On Duty spot, so don't count on any help if you need it. Rest rooms are available but no shower facilities are provided. The grounds are beautiful and obviously well maintained. All sites are paved and about half are fully serviced and the other half have no services.There are some excellent walking trails leading from this campsite and a bit of a hike will give you a break from the traffic noise.","March 25, 2016",Living on the Road beside the Road,264,"Winnipeg, Canada",2

Hot Springs National Park,"The Fordyce Bathhouse is a strange slice of history. Most of what the children read about and saw made this seem more like a house of torture than someplace to relax. Seen from a child's perspective: they made them take a bath, followed by a nap and then used manipulation machines, and the electro-bath. Doesn't that sound wonderful. The children did earn their Jr. ranger badge, which is always interesting, but takes quite a bit of time. It was a nice look at the way the human body was understood then, and good to ask how strange some of our practices today will seem in the future. I enjoyed the look of the buildings on the outside more than what they contained. The promenade behind the bath house is nice, if not very natural.

Hot Springs National Park,"The National Park was one of the key targets for our trip to Hot Springs. The NPS Visitor Center at the Fordyce Bathhouse is your entry point (and highlight in our opinion) to the park. Ensure that you allow enough time to tour all floors of the Fordyce. The tour gives one a good grounding into the history of the Hot Springs area and the detailed lifestyle of bathhouse patrons while visiting a bathhouse. I left with a much greater appreciation and understanding of the history of Hot Springs. The NPS Rangers on duty while we were there were very polite and helpful.The drive up to West Mountain and the view from the summit was underwhelming. A couple of overlooks on the way up to the summit did offer some average views of the city of Hot Springs and the surrounding area.We paid the requisite $14 for two adults to go to the top of the Hot Springs Mountain tower. Frankly, it was only slightly less underwhelming (slightly better) that West Mountain. Again, some decent views of the surrounding area and a little more of a view of the historic area of Hot Springs, but not much. If the tower price was $5-7 for two people, I would have felt better about the value. I wanted to give HSNP a rating of ""3"" due to the lackluster mountain aspects of the park, but relented in my conscience with a ""4"" rating due to the positive aspects of the Fordyce Bathhouse.","March 16, 2016",Tour the Fordyce House... the rest is ehhh.....,73,"Murfreesboro, Tennessee",4

Hot Springs National Park,"This is kind of an unusual National Park as it’s located in the middle of a downtown area. This park preserves both historical and natural heritage. The spas that built up around the hot springs were a big draw during the early 20th century. The park preserves several of these bathhouses along Bathhouse Row. Having visited the area in the past when most of these bathhouses were vacant and run-down, it’s nice to see them being renovated and being put to new uses. The National Park Services has been leasing them out as they are renovated. On this visit, I especially liked visiting the brewery that uses the local hot spring water for its beers. The bathhouses all have different architectural styles and details, and I notice something new about them every time I come here.I recommend going to the visitor center in the Fordyce Bathhouse when you first arrive. There you’ll be able to get information about the park so you’ll be able to plan the rest of your visit, and can tour the bathhouse to get a feel for the area’s history.Most of the hot springs at street level are not in their natural state anymore, but you can see (and feel) the water in some of the fountains along Bathhouse Row. At the north end of Bathhouse Row, across from the Arlington Hotel, there is a natural waterfall flowing into a pool where you can feel how hot the water is. I like coming here in the winter and seeing the steam from the springs contrast with the ice and snow on the ground. I enjoy mountain driving, so I make it a point to drive up Hot Springs Mountain when I visit. The mild twists and turns up the mountain take you up to a couple of scenic views as well as the viewing tower. I only went up in the tower my first time there. There is a fee, and once you’ve done it, you really don’t have to do it again.","November 15, 2015","History, Architecture, and Nature",252,"Dallas, Texas",5

We were hoping to be able to go into the Hot Springs or even see the Hot Springs but they were all capped except for one at the entrance to the park which was just a trickle of a water fall. Apparently they were capped to prevent contamination because it is their drinking water. The bathhouses on bathhouse row were interesting.

We only spent 1 day here, the restaurants around are great, but this town is noisy. I got tired of hearing all of the motorcycles going up an down the strip, but that is the town of Hot Springs.

The older buildings (that have been maintained) are absolutely spectacular! Unfortunately, the remains of buildings that had been awe-inspiring in their heyday were sad reminders of times gone by. It's a shame to let these magnificent buildings crumble with time. Hopefully, someone will see their potential and stop the deterioration. Shops are quaint and pleasant. Mountain top views, amazing!

There are also several trails. There are a couple of areas where you can obtain some drinking water from the springs. Either take your container or buy one from many vendors who sell them.

Scenic drive up the mountains on both drives with overlooks of the town and valley. Surprising lack of picnic areas. Only one on each mountain drive and they are small. Did not take any hikes but appears they could be very good through the forest. Lookout Tower fee did not justify our going up higher for more pictures of the same town and valley.

The trails that we went on were pretty easy, and it allowed our boys a chance to discover new types of rocks, plants and wildlife. It was one of the only times they have been very close to a deer, and the oldest couldn't stop talking about it later. The observation tower was a good experience and a good value. When you're tired of the trails, just head back down and find one of the many mineral water stations where you can fill containers with cooled water that is being pumped right out of the earth!

Hot Springs National Park,"I agree with other reviewers that as far as the city surrounding the park, Bath house Row is the only thing you need to see. Most of the businesses around the park are very old and outdated. There are lots of junky, touristy garbage shops. I get souvenir stores are in any tourist location but these are your typical 1994 lame t shirt stores. This is Arkansas! !! At least make the gift shops focus on rocks and minerals! So many of the businesses we went into were cash only, which was aggravating. All that said, I kept 4 stars because the bath houses are well maintained and interesting for history lovers. The older buildings have beautiful architecture. Visiting the hot springs is fun and the view from the top is gorgeous. So don't skip it, but be aware.

Hot Springs National Park,"The ""Park"" is actually the historic downtown of Hot Springs, with the main attraction being the massive hotel/spas; plus some walking and jogging trails nearby (and hot springs). There, of course, is no fee to enter the town. I loved the (fascinating) tour and movie (but dont know if kids would care). The main street passes thru everything you will want to see, and it's easy to just park and walk it. On one side are the small shops and eateries, and on the other side are the grassy lawns and the Grand Promenade, with benches, and drinking fountains that bring fresh water from the springs to drink or fill your bottles; and yes, it tastes good. The most memorable thing to do is to go into the 20th century bathhouses (National Historic Landmark District) and see the Gilded Age architecture and the stories of how they treated visitors; and then take a bath treatment yourself next door. It's all fairly inexpensive and a once in a lifetime experience. It's not like a luxury spa; more like a hospital. They draw water from the underground hotsprings, which is therapeutic. Hint: Fordyce Bathhouse serves as the Natl. Park's visitor center; the Buckstaff and Quapaw are the only ones still operating as bathhouses. The Arlington Hotel has a wide grand wrap around porch; and two ok-priced cafes inside, to enjoy the grand architecture.","February 16, 2015",Natl.

We then go back on the Peak Trail to the Hot Springs Mountain Trail to the Flora Trail to the Lower Dogwood Trail to the Arlington Trail. We didn’t know that the Arlington trail would actually take us into the Arlington hotel – that was certainly memorable. Make sure to take a trail map with you – you can mix and match and a number of different trails for a nice hike as long or short as you would like.

Hot Springs National Park,"We have visited a lot of National Parks. This one had a very odd layout. The park is in the middle of the city which is a bit confusing in a way. We stayed at the Gulpha Creek Campground. There was a 1.6 mile (moderate) trail connecting the campground to the visitor center (the visitor center is in the city area). The campground does not accept reservations, but we had no trouble getting a site upon our arrival. The visitor center was nice- it has some exhibits, a park film, and a junior ranger program. We walked along bath house row, but didn't actually enter the bath houses (I believe there was a fee to do so). Honeysuckle Trail is easy, but steep in places and ends with a cool stone shelter to check out. Tufa Terrace Trail is easy, but we were expecting to see mini waterfalls on the trail, but for the most part they were dried up, so this was a dud. The trails are NOT well marked. We would have liked to hiked a few more trails, but due to not being marked well- it was simply too confusing as you ended up walking in circles. Overall, I enjoyed this park and am glad we went.

One area that is really interesting is the Assembly Room, with a stained glass ceiling running almost the entire length. The Lamar Bath House is now a gift shop with the usual t-shirts and ball caps but also has books and bathing related items. We didn't go into any of the other Bath Houses but I understand the NPS leases those out to individual businesses. I believe the Buckstaff also offers traditional baths for a fee. We walked along the brick paved Grand Promenade and had some nice views of Bath House Row.There are several fountains around the area where you can fill up jugs to take with you. The water is tested on a regular basis and is safe to drink.We drove up Hot Springs Mountain and took the elevator to the top of the mountain tower (approx. $6/person unless you have an NPS pass) for excellent views of Hot Springs and the surrounding area. As we drove around the area, we saw a whitetail doe and two fawns on the road. West Mountain is also a very nice drive with much of the same views as Hot Springs Mountain.I don't know why other reviewers wrote negative reviews about this place.

Hot Springs National Park,"I always have good things to say about our national parks. In the case of this national park, I have mixed feelings. I understand that our government wanted to preserve the wonderful hot springs. Along with that I think there was a sense that the old bath houses that used them should be preserved as well. We had a tour of one of them (where the NP visitor center resides), and that was interesting. However, these bath houses were for the elite of their day. Two of them are still in use as concessions within the park and provide a range of spa services in a range of price from moderate to expensive. I almost felt like the national park moniker was there as a marketing device for the concessions. The park is very small, and there are a number of walking paths. Its side of the street is well maintained. The other side and most of Hot Springs is full of the usual tacky tourist trap stuff like a Tussaud's Wax Museum. That's why I have mixed feelings. It might have been more appropriate to call this a national or state historical site, but it is what it is. Oh...the deal made when our government took all of this over is that you can have as much spring water as you want for free. Just bring your own bottles.","October 18, 2014","Mixed feelings - interesting, but a national park?",692,"Raleigh, North Carolina",4

Hot Springs National Park,"Went for a walk in Hot Springs National Park, and after speaking to the information centre (located in the Fordyce Bathhouse on Central Ave) decided to do the Sunset Trail. All of the information we could see, including the maps provided by the park ranger, described the walk as 10 miles, but the ranger advised us that she thought the walk was actually more like 14 miles, plus a bit extra depending which additional loops you decided to do. In the end, we reckon we walked about 16 miles from start to finish, but enjoyed every moment of it. There were some pretty steep sections, but as the trail crosses several roads throughout the route many people choose to just do 1 or 2 sections of the trail, depending on their ability.We stopped to have lunch halfway through the walk at Balanced Rock and the view was amazing - well worth doing the extra little loop. The trail was all pretty well marked, even though it hadn't been blazed recently, and it was all so peaceful and beautiful - it was one of the best walks we've done since moving to America and I would highly recommend to anybody who enjoys hiking.","October 6, 2014",Stunning,113,"London, United Kingdom",5

If you like nature, history and beautiful scenery, this is a must visit place.","August 17, 2014",Great unplanned trip,5,,4
Hot Springs National Park,Hot Springs NP was our last stop on a cross country road trip. We had spent the night on seedy Central Ave the night before. We woke early and arrived at the park through the back route. The National Park mostly consists of Bath House Row in downtown Hot Springs. There is a monstrous building from some previous decade which towers over the town and has that insane asylum look. We walked bath house Row to Fordyce House which is the visitor center for the NP. We took a tour of the facility and the kids got there passports stamped. we enjoyed walking through the rooms. The place is like stepping back in time and has a creepy appeal. There is something sterile and medical about all the odd showers and pipes and vintage tubs and weird things you sit in. I suppose it was a different era. If you visit the basement you can see the coolers and the actual spring that fed the bath house encased in a tile-almost sarcophagus like structure. Many of the bath house have been restored and you can also visit them. we looked into getting spa treatments at the one next door to Fordyce. They are expensive but have survived the times that have shut down the other bath houses. This NP is not like other NP's. We did get some water from one of the many free fountains in the city and took it home with us. It was very hot when we got it but after a few hours in the fridge it was tasty. Glad we went but probably will not return. They do have great stickers of the National Park though complete with a bath tub.,"August 4, 2014",Bath houses,371,"Gulf Shores, Alabama",3
Hot Springs National Park,"We hiked the upper west trails around the Mountain Tower on our first day, doing about 7 miles total. They were relatively scenic and criss-crossed over the road a few times. Nothing spectacular, but a nice easy hike. Day two we want to hike longer, so we visited the Sunset Trail, a 10 mile U shaped hike (i.e. 20 miles unless you park your car at the end) This hike was a lot better as far as elevation and scenery, however, the trail passes through lots of high grass and bushes that you can't avoid touching, as they spill over onto the trail at times. We were fine on the hike, but within hours all 4 of us were itching like crazy! Turns out the area was inundated with chiggers! 2 members of my group had to get a steroid shot the next day because the outbreak was so bad, they were covered in little boils and blisters from hips to toes. We even hiked in long pants - didn't help! My advice, stay far, far away from here during chigger season! We never stopped or sat down, and also never ventured off the trail once - yet still got mauled by them! Our hotel said they are a MAJOR problem all across the entire city.","July 9, 2014",Watch out for CHIGGERS!,48,Texas,3
Hot Springs National Park,First off MUCH of the really interesting stuff is on the main street in Hot Springs. The National Park Service owns a number of the old bathhouses along the main drag in downtown Hot springs which are cool and filled with american history. Thats the cool part since we didnt adventure out to find out if the park offered more since the kids wanted to hit crystal mountain/magic springs a huge amusement/water park located 5mins outside of town. They loved it so did I because admission is a season pass tickett hey went EVERYDAY of our stay.... 5days straight...... Please do not expect a yellowstone type park because its a urban location with campgroungs back in the woods.,"July 7, 2014",Awesome history but NOT your average National park,22,,4
Hot Springs National Park,"When I saw a strip club at the entrance of the park, I should have known it to be a bad omen. I love national parks and have visited dozens or them but this place lacks merit. The tower scars the mountain beauty and the decrepit hotels remind me of insane asylums from years ago. Add cheap neon and wax museums to the mix and it becomes nearly repulsive. Other parts of Arkansas are beautiful but this place does not deserve national park status.

Hot Springs National Park,"Our goal as a family is to visit as many National Parks as possible. When we added Hot Springs National Park to our list we really didn't know what to expect. The park headquarters and much of the ""park"" itself is on the main street in Hot Springs. The National Park Service owns a number of the old bathhouses along the main street. The office occupies one of them. Two are still functioning as bathhouses if you have the time and are interested. The park store occupies yet another and a few more are being restored for future use.The park office can be toured. The building is beautiful and the exhibits and signs are very interesting, giving you an idea of how it functioned in the past.We also did two drives in the park. One led up to a tall tower. However, it cost $7 to ride the elevator to the top and we passed. The drives were pretty and we saw some wildlife.There are some parts of this town that are open for business, but there are many vacant buildings too.The girl in the National Park gift shop was very friendly and informative. Talking to her was very enjoyable. Across the street from Bathhouse Row were a number of little tourist shops and restaurants.I wouldn't consider this National Park a destination, but if you are passing through it is something to see. It only takes a few hours.","June 28, 2014",A Different National Park,201,"Bethlehem, Pennsylvania",4
Hot Springs National Park,"We have traveled pretty much the entire USA, and our visit to Hot Springs clearly stands above the rest as a disappointment. The pictures of the Bath Row historic district and other landmarks are accurate, but do not look across the street. The Bath Row historic district consists of a row of a few restored bathhouses. They look wonderful, but the rest of the town that we drove through, all of it, was just seedy and creepy. The very large structure that towers over the town is now a rehabilitation center. The entire area around the historic area, and that includes right across the street, is not a place in which I would want to leave my car. I could not wait to leave. I am sorry to denigrate an entire town, but it is billed as such an interesting place to go, and it looks so run down and the people on the street are worrisome. It you are going straight to one of the primary spas, do that and avoid anyplace else. For me, it is not worth the trip to go there at all. Carefully look at the reviews of any place you go, because you will not want to go anywhere else while you are there, at least anyplace near the historic district and the hotels in that area. Just awful. I wish I had paid attention to others who said the same thing.","June 20, 2014",JUST AVOID THE ENTIRE CITY,41,Indianapolis,1
Hot Springs National Park,"We enjoyed the variety this national park offers! The architecture of Bathhouse Row and the guided tour of the Fordyce Bathhouse were fascinating. Then there are the natural hot springs and fountains - so cool. You reach right in and feel their thermal heat. But best part for us was our hike in the beautiful forest/hills. We chose to drive up to the tower and skip the climb to its top. Instead we hiked along Hot Springs Mountain Trail to Gulpha Gorge Trail which leads down to a shallow Gulpha Creek. Its a nicely groomed wide trail, a lot of which is down hill. Then you are rewarded for the hike with the chance to walk into the cool creek and chill. Perfect place to bring your picnic creekside. Of course you have to hike back up which takes some energy. But it's lovely and not terribly difficult. Maybe you don't wish to hike per se, so be sure to stroll the paved, short Grand Promenade behind Bathhouse Row and then visit the local stores. This park was a great stop in this pretty part of the country. ","June 15, 2014",Good Variety in This Park,30,"Dallas, Texas",4
Hot Springs National Park,"Agree w/ others that this National Park is not typical as it's in a completely urban setting. There is NO FEE to visit this park but do your part and leave at least $5/person to help it be charming for others after you. Touring the Fordyce Bath house, which IS the N.P. vis center, was fabulous as we caught a tour from a volunteer which enhanced our self tour. Restoration and history is fascinating. Realizing that these mineral baths were health cures of their time helps one understand a piece of history long gone since invention of penicillin. Charming and fun to spend a whole day on Bathhouse Row and then cross the street to the City area. V.C. desk staff had some very friendly people. The scenic drives are short, and the hikes interesting. The humidity is not enjoyable. Fascinating piece of history w/ gangsters, the wealthy, and the 'old days'.

Hot Springs National Park,"I would call this a National Historical Area before I'd call it a National Park. It's wonderful in it's own right, and I think the big attraction is bathhouse row. It's a wonderful tour of historical buildings with some really stunning architecture. The town is surrounded by beautiful scenery. We toured the Fordyce Bathhouse, which is a must see. We also did a few trails up to the mountain peak, which was really beautiful! My favorite part. It's a very humid place. The trails were not always well marked. Luckily most of the ones nearby are not really long. We skipped the observation tower as there are many wonderful views of the Ouachita Mountains that are free. Parking is free on Sunday. Maybe everyone else knows this, but I did not and put $2 in the meter. Best to check & make sure at the city visitor center, which is not the Park visitor center. This is a quaint place, more for people who enjoy historical sites, main street shopping, and spas.

Hot Springs National Park,"This national park is unique in several respects. It's the only national park I know of in the middle of town. The history of the facilities and the springs provided alot of insights into the culture of our country during Victorian times. And our ability to examine the sights up close, walking inside and around the grounds, helped my family and me better imagine the experiences of those attending the springs for medicinal, theraputic and rejuvination reasons when they were so touted.It might sound boring, but it's really not at all. Plan on spending 11/2 hrs or so. Then, enjoy being in town. It's a really beautiful place. Can be hot in the summer, but spring and fall are ideal.There's no admission to the park, but you need to find parking in town.

Hot Springs National Park,This national park is unique in that it is impossible to tell where the park begins/ends and where the city begins/ends. It's all together in a big package. The National Park area includes one of the gorgeous old bath houses as a visitors center: you can explore the bath house and see a very informative film on the history of the area--well worth while. The rest of the park is mountain drives which are beautiful and also worthwhile. The city itself is old and showing its age--the downtown is old and doesn't have much to offer other than the bath houses and a few shops. The near downtown area is borderline slums with rundown buildings--you have to drive through this area to get to the downtown. The real action is a few miles out of downtown near the racetrack and casino with new hotels and new restaurants. Worth the visit.,"April 17, 2014",Great national park,179,"Grand Blanc, Mi",5

Hot Springs National Park,"Four of us went to Hot Springs National Park for the spring break weekend. It was quite crowded. Decent motels were full. So we stayed at a motel in Lake Hamilton and drove into town each day. This old town has a lot of history dated back to the 19th century. You can read about them in the ""exhibition hall"" of the mountain tower. It costs $7 per visitor to go up to the top. You can get an aerial view of the town from the observation deck. We took the elevator up and came down on the exterior metal stairs.We had our thermal bath at the Buckstaff Bath House, the only operating bath house on the bathhouse row. It does not have long open hours. Make sure you go early if you plan on having all kinds of treatments. If not, you might have to wait. Soaking in the hot tub and sitting in the ""steam box"" is quite relaxing. There are several hot spring fountains in the city. You can drink the ""hot"" water there. As a matter of fact, lots of the residence bring plaster jugs to the fountains, fill them up, and take them home for consumption. We filled our water bottles and tasted the water. It's soft water!","March 15, 2014",Interesting Old Town,32,Lansdale,4
Hot Springs National Park,"The town itself was not very impressive, however once you get to Bath House Row it all changes. Although most of the Bath Houses are empty there are a few that are open. If you stop by Fordyce Bath House you will find a few National Park Service Volunteers as well as Park Rangers and you can tour the House at your own pace. I highly recommend trying out the elevator at least once, although it does not work as it did back in the davit is still pretty cool. This Bath House has been restored to it's former glory and gives you a glance into the past. I loved this House you can see all the equipment they used, the baths themselves, changing rooms with actual clothing in them, courtyards, music room and even hotel like guest rooms, it is fantastic. A few steps away from that house you will find another 2 Houses that are actual Bath Houses although they are a bit modernized inside you still get the idea and maybe can indulge in a Hot Bath yourself. There is one that is used as a gift shop and you can get your National Park Passport stamped there. I loved this place and regret not partaking in a Bath, oh well maybe next time. FYI the cheapest Bath is $30 at one of the Bath Houses which is pretty economical. You may want to pass on the $7 to go up in the tower as it is not very impressive and does not give you a view of the Bath Houses, do go in the Arlington Hotel it's pretty neat!","March 15, 2014",Amazing,95,"Dallas, Texas",5

There is just enough to do here for a day.Bring water bottles and fill up from the spring taps either in the middle of town near the bath houses, or at the end of Fountain street.

We didn't go into too many shops but there are some cool places to stop and have lunch or drinks. All in all, we enjoyed our trip to the park and it is definitely full of beautiful scenery and history.There is no general parking--there is street (metered) parking, a parking garage a good ways from the park, and a few lots.

Hot Springs National Park,"Recently had a conference in Dallas, and was looking for somewhere green to go for a few days prior to the conference. Hot Springs is about a four hour drive, but well worth the time spent. What a gem of a city! As the other reviewers have stated, the National Park is in the middle of the city, and it focuses more on the history and culture surrounding the Hot Springs and the industry of the bath houses that put Hot Springs, AR on the map. Definitely take the short motor trail up the mountain to the lookout. There is a moderate fee, but it is worth it. I particularly enjoyed reading each and every one of the placards in the tower. Bathhouse Row is lined with beautiful buildings with different architectural styles. Only a few are open, but the buildings are gorgeous. I would HIGHLY recommend partaking in an old fashioned bath spa treatment. If it wasn't for the video at the Visitor's Center of the National Park that depicted the elements of a typical bath experience, I would not have thought about doing it. My friend and I enjoyed the treatment at the Arlington Hotel since the Buckstaff Bathhouse was closing the day we visited.

There are fountains located a few places around town where you can fill up a jug or two with spring water to take home. We didn't spend much time here, but did go into one of the bath houses (we made a reservation about a week before we arrived) and bathe in a hot tub of spring water. We also visited the Visitor's Center (temporarily relocated a few bath houses down from its usual location due to some renovations - signs on the original location will direct you where to go) and drove up the mountain to the Observation Tower (but didn't go up the Tower). It's an OK place with some unique features, but it's probably our least favorite National Park visited so far (my husband has visited 26 of the 59 Parks, I've probably visited 21 or 22).

We had no idea what a tourist trap it is. We were pulling a camper & parking & getting around there was aweful! We finally found a lot towards the end of town to park our truck & camper at. Then we visited the visitor center & walked around town a bit. We were very dissappointed the rangers didn't tell us there was a bus that would take us to the top of the big hill! The drive up to the observation tower said no vehicles over 30 feet & we definately were so we walked all the way up the hiking trail to it. Our 7 year old was exhausted by the time we go there & it was miserably HOT outside! Then when we got to the top we spotted the tour bus - and it was even free. And then when we got to the observation tower, it was expensive to ride the elevator to the top. So although its nice enough to visit, make sure you do it with a small car","July 1, 2013",just okay,160,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",3
Hot Springs National Park,I have been here several times and recently drove through Hot Springs and took a drive to the top of the national park to see the views. Beautiful and if you prefer to walk they have hiking trails as well.

Hot Springs National Park,"My wife and I stopped at Hot Springs National Park on our way north through Arkansas. It wasn't quite what I expected as in “National Park'. It's smack dab in the middle of the town and a collection of the old spas which have been restored into a variety of spas, and bars, etc. It was very pleasant and you can see it all in an hour or so if you decide, like we did, that you don't want to partake of the spa facilities.","April 12, 2013","Not quite what I expected, but nice.",29,Central Texas,3

Hot Springs National Park,"I really expected a park, but was more of an urban park. The town grew around the park that consists of a row of old time bath houses that are large and exotic plus the area of the springs Which is a green space and most beautiful. Some houses were still in use some were being renovated some were awaiting lessors. The bathhouses are owned by the federal government, designated as the first national park and use the water from the hot springs that is 140 degrees. Ergo hot not warm springs. One of the houses had a sandwich shop with very good food. It's is the one we saw. A very large room with several pools, small and large, held many people in swimsuits relaxing ""taking the water"". When we asked, we found the bathhouses and many of the hotels offered private baths as well. One of the houses had a steam basement you could use. Lovely place, on a Saturday there was a crowd. This place is a gem and a big surprise. So glad we went. Beautiful.Lots of places to stay, but book early.","April 6, 2013",Not your mama's National park,48,"Owensboro, Kentucky",5

Hot Springs National Park,"A short 7 hour drive from Houston, Hot Springs has become a favorite place to chill on a long weekend. We recently were there over the Thanksgiving weekend staying at the Embassy Suites (great choice) & saw amazing fall colors. I like to think of Hot Springs as Colorado Lite if you will. Nice mountains at 600' so no high elevation issues within a 7 hr drive from Houston. Before I get slammed, no, the mountains are not like the 14k'ers but neither are they a 20-24 hr drive away either. The fall colors were amazing. The drive along West Mountain drive was like driving in New England in the fall. The Promenade harkens back to a much earlier proper time and is a great place to walk, relax, take pictures & people walk. We love the historic bathhouses & ended up ""soaking"", as my wife calls it, every day. Plenty of really nice photo opportunities with the hot water coming out of the mountain and plenty of fountains. We have 2 teenagers & even they had a great time. The only negative was that there were some panhandlers, albeit discrete, as there is plenty of law enforcement presence by Hot Springs PD & the Nat'l Park Rangers. If you love old historic buidings, circa 1890's plus, you will love this place as well. We plan a return visit next year.","December 31, 2012",Hot Springs- think Colorado Lite- mountains at 600' & hot baths,41,"Houston, Texas",5

We took the ranger-led tour through the Fordyce Bathhouse (which will probably be discontinued soon because it's being renovated) and really enjoyed seeing history first-hand. We made time for a private bath at Quapaw and loved it, and we enjoyed the spa-like gift shop in the park office. Be sure to make time for the video that plays continuously at the park office too.

Hot Springs National Park,"It was great timing during my visit on September 18, 2012. The weather was warm with a clear sky. This park has scenic drives, and many hiking paths. Make sure you get a map from the visitor center, since the park is located in different areas of the city of Hot Springs. The main portion of Hot Springs National Park is located in downtown Hot Springs. A scenic walk is located in what is called the Grand Promenade. A scenic drive towards the back of the park will take you to the Mountain Tower. In a different section of Hot Springs National Park is an area called Whittington Park. Finally, at the intersection of Whittington Avenue and West Mountain Drive, is the West Mountain portion of Hot Springs National Park. Here you will find a scenic drive with scenic overlooks, plus more hiking trails. This national park is a fun and beautiful place to visit during late summer and early fall when it is not very crowded, since many of the tourists are back to work or school.

Hot Springs National Park,"I was somewhat disappointed by the fact that there aren't any easily seen hot springs in Hot Springs National Park. We learned from the 15 minute video at the Welcome Center that the main street where all of the springs used to be was covered over years ago to make room for more tourist attractions. The only way to see one of the springs is to go to one of the Bath Houses and pay to take a bath in it. My 8 1/2 year old and I didn't have the time to do that, so we toured the National Park building and saw all of the old tubs, recreational faciltiies and learned a lot of history without ever seeing a hot spring. It was a side trip on our way home from Texas to Ohio and I am glad to say we have seen another National Park, but it wasn't really worth the added time or expense. Just a word worth noting: there was a sign in the Welcome Center that said the building was going to be closed soon for remodeling so I would call ahead to see if it is open or not.","October 6, 2012",Disappointing but interesting,101,"Akron, Ohio",3

Hot Springs National Park,"We recently stayed at the Arlington Hotel inside Hot Springs National Park. We were disappointed with the hotel but LOVED that we were located directly across the street from the park itself. We enjoyed going up to the lookout tower at dusk to see the mountains and city below. We also loved watching people fill their jugs with the mineral water coming straight from the ground which is supposed to be safe to drink straight from it's source! You can also fill bottles and jugs up for free from several fountains placed inside the park.If drinking the detoxifying mineral water isn't enough, you can take a hot mineral bath in a 100 year old bathhouse where Al Capone, himself, and several president's have visited. I'd recommend The Buckstaff Bathhouse for the nostalgic experience but don't forget to bring your bathing suit if you're the modest type like we are! lolThere are so many places to shop along Bathhouse Row inside the park and quite a few places to eat... we loved Andrew's for their Cajun food and Roberto's for their Latin food. The best part of visiting the National Park is the beauty of the park and the mountains itself. We left a severe drought and over 100 degree temperatures back in Missouri to find a cool mountain breeze inside Hot Springs National Park. PLEASE take the time to slow down and maybe have a picnic under a tree with your family. There are so many walking trails (we didn't get to walk them like we'd wanted to). You don't have to walk though. The drive is just as pretty:-)","August 16, 2012",The park is a treasure you shouldn't miss!,230,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5

When there's no horse racing there is simulcasting & a gaming room upstairs. The first Friday of every month there is a galary walk downtown.

Hot Springs National Park,"Hot Springs National Park may be the smallest national park that we've visited, but it makes up for its small size by being delightfully charming and historically interesting. The park is composed of several blocks of bathhouses (“Bathhouse Row”) and an adjacent hillside in downtown Hot Springs. Each of the bathhouse buildings is different and offers the visitor a visual façade that is reminiscent of the late 1800’s. Be sure to take time to stroll the “Grand Promenade” on the hillside, a great walking trail and easy hike to view the bathhouses (and town) from above.","August 8, 2012",Delightful Little National Park,63,"Williamsburg, Virginia",5

Hot Springs National Park,"I recently spent a week in Hot Springs Arkansas. The National Park is wonderful. There you can take a hot bath, tour a restored bath house, stroll the tree lined streets and view art. Across the street are many quaint shops and cafe's. Behind the bath houses are some interesting path ways that lead to hidden springs. The path will also lead you up the mountain to the observation tower. You can also drive to the tower, but if you are reasonably fit, you could walk it in about an hour. Some of the off beat things to do in Hot Springs is to visit Devils Half Acre. If you do a google search you will find out more about this secret quirky hole in the ground. The horse race track is pulsing with life and is a very popular thing to do. They also have a conventional casino there with lots of electronic games. Visit the web site for Oaklawn Race Track for free money give aways, and food specials during the week.We stayed in Hot Springs Village. It is about 15 miles from Hot Springs. It is a planned retirement community. It is a massive place, probably 30 miles long and 7 miles wide. It is filled with golf courses, fishing lakes, nature paths. It has a few restaurants and there is a Wal-Mart at the entrance. I rented a 2 bedroom, 2 bath condo from RCI for $300 a week. It was a screaming deal, and a absolutely beautiful condo. It was located right on a lake, had a beautiful deck, fire place, hot tub, full kitchen, dining room...this place was great.As far as places to eat, Cajun Paradise was very tasty and just at the entrance of Hot Springs Village. It is just a little trailer, like a snow cone stand but had soft shell crab, oysters, catfish. Good stuff. A restaurant in Hot Springs was Cajun Boilers. If you go to Resaurant.com you can get a coupon for $25 off your meal. You have to spend $35. The seafood platter was very good at Cajun Boilers. The Blue Money is a very good caribbean restaurant. It is located just off the loop on the outskirts of Hot Springs.As for day trips, we went to the Bill Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock. I give it 2 stars out of 5. It is beautiful, but repeats a lot of the information in different places. Heifer International has a fantastic building next to the Clinton Library. Very interesting place. They give cows to starving villages around the world. They will give you a guided tour of their eco friendly building. 3.5 stars out of 5.One day it rained and we needed to stay indoors. We went the the Museum of the Americas. This place is a fantastic place. Lots of hands on things to do, special exhibits (a ship wreck while we were there), a electricty show that was amazing. Well worth the admission. 4 our of 5 stars. If you are a member of another science center, you may get in free. We are a member of Sci-Port in Shreveport and did not have to pay.Garvin Gardens in Hot Springs is also a beautiful place to visit. It costs about $7 to tour many trails that go by beautiful lake, streams and flower gardens. The church in the woods is amazing. You don't have to pay to see it. It is just a few yards from the entrance to Garven Gardens. 3.5 out of 5 stars.The real fun started with day trips around Hot Springs. We went to Murfreesboro where you can did for diamonds in a real diamond mine. We didn't find any but people do. 4 our of 5 stars.There is a place to eat in Murfreesboro called Buddy's that has great Chicken Fried Steak.While in Murfreesboro, be sure and head up to the dam. It is a place called The Narrows. There is a great place to fish for trout at a park at the base of the dam called Riverside Park. 5 ourt of 5 stars. There is a great campground up Dynamite Hill. Just below the campground is a fantastic marina called Swaha. There is a cafe there right on the water and is a great place to view Lake Greeson.Another place to visit is Camp Albert Pike. 5 out of 5 stars. This is one of my favorite places on the planet. It is a fantastic clear water swimming hole in the Little Missouri River. I don't have room to tell you how to get there but if interested do a google search for Camp Albert Pike. If you drive a dirt road, which is in great shape, you can visit Little Missouri Falls. (5 out of 5 stars)It is a beautiful waterfall about 17 miles from Camp Albert Pike. Another place to visit near Albert Pike is Shady Lake (5 out of 5 stars). This is one of the most tranquil beautiful spots on the earth. If you drive the dirt road from Albert Pike to Shady Lake, you are in for quite an adventure. The road is good, but steep and narrow in spots. You will drive through beautiful forests, dive on mountain ridges, switch back on mountain roads. It is a fun drive. I would allow about an hour to drive the 17 miles or so from Albert Pike to Shady Lake.As you can tell my highest rated attractions are free nature attractions. If you don't like that kind of activity, you probably would reverse my ratings and give Hot Springs National Park, Oaklawn, Garven Gardens, Clinton Library, higher ratings, and the nature activities lower ratings. I love beautiful nature places and free activities.Washington State Park, near Hope is a interesting place to visit. The 200 year old restaurant there is fantastic, with plate lunches around $7. I think it is called Williams Tavern and is open 11-7 seven days a week. You can tour the old buildings at Washington State Park. 4 out of 5 stars.The visitors center along the Cassatot River is beautiful. Walk down the trail and wet a line and you are sure to catch something. Ask about going to view the Skull Crushing area. It is a very rough part of the Cassatot River, very beautiful. It is about a 7 mile drive from the visitors center along a dirt road. 5 out of 5 stars.I could go on and on. We visited many other corp of engineer parks, trout fishing waters in Hot Springs, camp grounds along the Cassatot River. There are many other lakes and streams to tour. If you are going to drive the dirt roads, I highly suggest you get a Delorme road Atlas. It has all the dirt roads on it. A gps is helpful also. It is reassuring to know where you are when you are way back in the woods and drive for miles and hours without seeing anybody. Keep a full tank of gas, and have the time of your life.","July 17, 2012",There is more to Hot Springs Arkansas than the National Park,43,Bossier City,5
