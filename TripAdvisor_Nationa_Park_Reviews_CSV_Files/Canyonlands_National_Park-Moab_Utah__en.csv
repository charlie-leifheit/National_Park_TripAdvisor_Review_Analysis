Canyonlands National Park,"We did this part of the park on our own - did Mesa Arch, Upheaval Dome (we hiked all the way to the 2nd overlook) and Grand View Point trail. We did Needles with a 4 wheel drive tour - it was awesome as well ","October 18, 2019",Islands in the Sky,9,"Sedona, Arizona",5
Canyonlands National Park,"Great park with lots to see, so many great views and a contrast to Arches in many ways. Favourite was Upheaval Dome, well worth the walk up to see and not difficult but the Dome is unique and still a bit of a mystery.","October 18, 2019",Another spectacular park,10,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom",5
Canyonlands National Park,"We travelled to both Island in the Sky and the Needles sections and did short hikes in both. It's a long way between the two sections, but there is wonderful scenery in both.","October 18, 2019",A wide-spread park,0,,4
Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands was beautiful and I’m so glad we went. We spent 4-5 hours in the park. It was a pretty low key place; not a ton of visitors on the day we went and friendly park rangers. We stopped at the info center and borrowed a junior ranger backpack with supplies and it made the trip a little more interesting for our almost 4yo. We highly recommend doing the jr ranger activities. After they finish the required activities, the kids take an oath to protect the park and get a little wooden badge that’s pretty neat. We did a couple short kid-friendly hikes recommended by the ranger. One was to the end of the Grand View scenic area. Our daughter did get tired and we had to carry her a bit, but depending on your little one’s ability to walk a couple miles it could be fun. It’s an easy hike. Definitely family friendly. And has spectacular views at the end. Canyonlands made for a fun day. A lot less crowded than Arches and beautiful in its own way.","October 18, 2019",Beautiful place,2,,5
Canyonlands National Park,"we enjoyed canyonlands the best out of all we visited. we went to the grand staircase, Arches, Bryce, Zion, and others. this is almost as good as the grand canyon","October 18, 2019",the best,18,"Chesterfield, Virginia",5
Canyonlands National Park,"We did the flight tour over Arches and Canyonlands first, then spend a day hiking/sight-seeing in each park. Mesa Arch was our favorite spot.","October 17, 2019",Amazing Park,1,,5
Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands National Park is developed for the hikers with its many trails. Even if you are not into hiking the trails, stopping at the viewpoints is worth the time of a side trip.Our primary reason for being in the area was to visit Arches National Park but we saw the side trip to Canyonlands National Par as an opportunity that we didn't want to miss We only drove part way into the park to enjoy the view of the canyon. That much was well worth the time. Hiking the trails is definitely the best way to see the sites in the park.","October 17, 2019",Worth the stop for the view even if you are not into hiking the trails,32,"Sparks, Nevada",4
Canyonlands National Park,Canyonlands National Park is fairly big and we only got to the northern portion of the park. There are a few easy hiking trails and the vista are just amazing. We are planning to head back to visit the rest of the park.,"October 17, 2019",Wonderful vista of canyons,18,"Boston, Massachusetts",5
Canyonlands National Park,"Drove from Aches to Canyonlands about 30 minutes. Places to see Green River overlook, Mesa Arch & Shafer Trail. It was a beautiful experience and the best view was from the Mesa Arch.","October 17, 2019",Close to Arches ,4,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5
Canyonlands National Park,"We were at Canyonlands National Park on this late September Wednesday and just like yesterday it was a sunny and hot day.We arrived around 8:45 at the Island in the Sky visitor centre and the parking lot (25+ parking spots) was quite busy. This is a smaller visitor centre in comparison to Arches National Park.We did 3 hikes including Mesa Arch, Upheaval Dome (overlooks 1 and 2) and Grand View Point plus 2 stops at viewpoints.The Mesa Arch hike is rated easy and there is about parking for about 25+ vehicles at the trailhead. There are also 2 washrooms here.The trail for the most part is compact dirt, gravel and sand with some exposed rock. The out and back trail mildly undulates and is about .8 kilometer in length (1/2 mile each way) and took less than 25 minutes to get to Mesa Arch from the parking lot. You can can get some nice views at the arch as well as some nice photos of the Arch and the background view of the canyon below.The Upheaval Dome trail is rated moderate and we found it fairly easy to hike. At this location there are 30+ parking spots, washrooms and a picnic table.For the first part of the hike up from the trailhead, there is a set of man-made stairs that is mostly compact dirt, gravel and exposed rock as is the rest of the trail up to the first lookout. The hike down and then up to the 2nd overlook is mostly over exposed rock. For this part of the hike you will need to follow the cairn trail markers (piled up rocks) over the large exposed rock face. At the first destination there are views of the upheaval dome. At the 2nd trail end you will also get views of the upheaval dome and views of the surrounding valley.The round trip was about 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers). In total we spent about 70 minutes with rest stops. When we got down to the parking lot by noon time, vehicles were looking for spots and also parking on the shoulder of the road.Green River viewpoint has about 15 or more parking spots and 1 washroom. There is no hiking involved here, just a short walk on a paved path to the lookout. Buck Canyon viewpoint is worth a 5 minute visit. Again this is on a short paved path that is 200 feet in length.At Grand View viewpoint there is a lookout and also the trailhead for the hike that is rated easy. In my opinion, this trail was harder than Mesa Arch relatively speaking. It was a nice short hike in sunny hot weather. There are nice views of the canyons below throughout the 1.5 kilometer (1 mile) hike. As for the trail itself it is mostly exposed rock with some compact dirt and gravel. At the start of the trail there some man-made steps heading down.At the end of the trail there are more sweeping views of the valley. This part is a little more difficult to get to the top, maybe about 20-30 yards in length at most. We were able to get to the viewpoint with very little difficulty even though we are older hikers.We spent about 70 minutes in total during the 3 kilometer (2 mile) hike.There are washroom facilities near the parking lot.I would rate the overall park experience as good at 3.75 out of 5.Notes &Tips: • Depending on your approach you can end up at the Needles Visitor Center where there are more sites and trails to explore. From Moab you would need to drive 75 miles away from Arches National Park on route 191 to 211 to get to the visitor centre. • If I were to compare Canyonlands to Arches, in my opinion, I like Arches better but each of the parks have their own unique characteristics; Arches with their arch formations and Canyonlands with the valley views. Go to both and decide for yourself! • We used a National Parks Pass that allowed us to enter Arches National Park for free. The regular price is $30 per vehicle. • At the interpretive centre there are washrooms and a small gift shop. You can also buy bottled water here or fill your water bottles here. There is no cafe or restaurants in this park. It would be a good idea to pack a lunch as there are picnic tables at some locations in the park. I have never seen this before but there are regular western toilets and squat toilets at this visitors centre. • Pick up your park map and information pamphlet here. Plan your visit on the internet before you get here so you’ll know in advance what you want to see. • At the centre there is a short 15 minute orientation movie every 20 minutes and also scheduled ranger talks • Go early to avoid the crowds  • In total we spent about 6 hours in the park • If you plan to spend more than 1/2 day at the park, take lunch and lots of water • Bring suntan lotion and wear a hat as there is no shade. During the last week of September it was still hot and sunny. • I would recommend a good pair of trail runners or day hikers and definitely no flip-flops! • Canyonlands National Park is about a 25 mile (40 kilometers) drive to Arches National Park. • Dead Horse Point State Park is about 22 miles (35 kilometers) from the Island in the Sky visitor centre at Canyonlands National Park • This was our third day in Moab and we visited Arches National Park yesterday. See my review. • We stayed at the Hyatt Place in Moab. See my review. • We were on our 4th day of our 13 day Nevada-Arizona-Utah trip. Other national parks we visited on this trip included Bryce Canyon and Zion. See my reviews. • State and private parks we visited included Goblin Valley, Monument Valley, Lower and Upper Antelope and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. See my reviews. • Buy an annual pass if you plan to visit more than 3 national parks in the next 12 months as it is cheaper in the long run","October 16, 2019",Another amazing national park – 3.75 out of 5 rating,781,"Richmond, Canada",4
Canyonlands National Park,Our first visit to Canyonlands was incredibly awe inspiring. We spent our first day in the Needles district on the south end of the park. We took several short hikes and enjoyed every one. The views are almost as grand as the Grand Canyon. We did a jeep tour our 2nd day and had a great time! The tour included a couple of short hikes that provided incredible views. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable about the geology and even taught us how to look for fossils. We had a wonderful day. Kudos to Phil at Navtec Tours.If you’re in the Moab area make sure to spend some time in Canyonlands. It’s an incredible park.,"October 15, 2019",Awesome,44,"Loveland, Colorado",4
Canyonlands National Park,"I've visited many state and national parks, and this one is either first or second in my book (along with Grand Canyon). Don't miss going to the Island in the Sky portion of the park, and especially the Grand View Point. Seems like one can see the incredible, varied red rock formations for a hundred miles. While my mobility doesn't allow me to hike or bike any more, I know from the reports of members of my family that there also are incredible trails for four-wheeling, biking, and hiking.

Canyonlands National Park,"I just got a new camera so this trip has been an awesome one....learning a lot about my camera with amazing scenery to shoot. Stopped at most of the viewing areas...got lots of great pics. Not quite as picturesque as some of the other parks, but still a good take. Lots of hikers and mountain bikers using the many trails.","October 14, 2019",#4 of 5 on Mighty Five trip,98,"Fort Myers, Florida",4
Canyonlands National Park,We only had half a day to spend and are so happy we decided to come. We went on two hikes that were breathtaking. We had just enough time left to drive through the park and stop at the overlooks. This park is a must-see!!!!,"October 13, 2019",INCREDIBLE!!!,31,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5
Canyonlands National Park,"There are 3 districts to Canyonlands. Island of the Sky, the most visited and easiest to drive. Needles, down south, and The Maze a very remote area and pretty much 4-wheel drive accessible. We have enjoyed the first two","October 11, 2019",Day trip,59,"Temecula, California",5

Canyonlands National Park,This park is amazing. Cannot begin to describe the beauty. Something new around every turn. A must see when in the Moab area.,"October 11, 2019",Breathtaking!,0,,5
Canyonlands National Park,"During our 2nd day of our visit in Utah and after our 1st day at Arches, we went to Canyonlands. We had such a great time in Arches, we weren't quite sure what to expect out of CNP. We surely were not disappointed - from its vast and canyon filled views as far as your eyes can see, to wonderful mesa topped viewing areas to one of the most magnificent locations I have ever seen (Mesa Arch) to a very scenic and amazing drive, we thoroughly enjoyed this unique and much different national park than its local sister, Arches.","October 10, 2019",An exceptional National Park and a must do while in Utah,199,New Jersey,5
Canyonlands National Park,Maybe not as long and wide but just as beautiful is the canyon where the Colorado River runs through this park. The Green River runs through here too! This area is full of history and beauty along with a lot of salt! There are even some sights you might remember from the movies. ,"October 10, 2019",Another “Grand “ Canyon,38,"Forks, Washington",5
Canyonlands National Park,This was yet another awe-inspiring stop on our bus tour of Utah's five national parks. You honestly need to take the time to take in these parks. It's actually difficult to explain how wonderful these sights are.,"October 9, 2019",Well worth the trip...,119,"Bangor, Maine",4
Canyonlands National Park,Another place you have to really see in person to appreciate its beauty. We went to Island in the Sky and Needles. The first gives you the perspective looking down on the canyons. The second lets you drive through one. Be sure to stop at Newspaper Rock on the way to Needles if you go there.,"October 9, 2019",Great vistas,27,"Denver, Colorado",5
Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands is a huge park with Island in the Sky the closest to Moab and the most visited and the Needles part of the park further away and vastly different. A mini Grand Canyon is the best way to describe the Island in the Sky park, the views from the mesa rim are breathtaking. Needles further south is very different and after Island in the Sky somewhat disappointing. Not because it is not special but that the particular needles part of the part requires a 4x4 and a permit to access it properly, particularly Chesler Park. Needles is less frequented because of it's location but it is special in it's on way.","October 8, 2019","Vastly different to Arches, do not miss it when in Moab.",27,"Sydney, Australia",5

Canyonlands National Park,"I still liked the Grand Canyon’s colors more, but I’m glad we went to Zion, Bryce, Arches, and Canyonlands. Each is very different in hiking, topography, rock formation, plants! We couldn’t find the White Rim Overlook Trail when we got to Grand View Point/ poor signage. ","October 7, 2019",Huge canyon area; not crowded in early October ,29,"Bethesda, MD",5
Canyonlands National Park,"You definitely need more than one day to see even half of Canyonlands. If staying in Moab, your best bet is to hit the Island in the Sky section of the park. If you like to hike, take the trail to the lower viewpoint at Upheaval Dome and make your own guess as how it was formed. Or hike to Mesa Arch and frame your best shot. Now we just need to figure out when we can come back and see the other two-thirds of the park!","October 7, 2019",Wish we had more time!,0,,5
Canyonlands National Park,"Awesome views of the canyons and lands. A good drive from Moab and plenty to see on the way. We loved our visit.

Canyonlands National Park,"Magnificent scenery. This park can be enjoyed with mainly driving around and a few times of getting out of your car at the lookout points. We were tired from traveling when we got to Moab and asked which park was easier to see. This park is definitely easier to see, but if you’re a hiker, there’s plenty of hiking available. ","October 3, 2019",Awe inspiring,38,"Hockley, Texas",5
Canyonlands National Park,"We visited Canyonlands National Park 3 times over course of 4 days twice to Islands in the Sky and once to The Needles.Islands in the sky is a short drive from Moab and the 1st time we manged to walk to White Rim Over Look, Murphy Point and Upheaval Dome, all recommended by the helpful Park Staff all gave different perspectives of the Park.The following day we visited Needles which is a much longer drive from Moab but it you have more than one day in Canyonlands it is well worth the drive, again the helpful Park staff recommended the walk out to Chesler Park View Point, whilst this was a longer and harder walk than the ones in Island of the Sky, it was well worth the effort.In Island of the Sky you get great over views from the top, whilst going to Needles you get a completely different perspective from the bottom. Both give you the most amazing views and the grandeur of the National Park, everyday we had our breath taken away by the sheer beauty and majesty of the Park. It is amazing to visit both Canyonlands and Arches which are are next to each other and yet are so different.","October 3, 2019",Simply Stunning,6,,5
Canyonlands National Park,"Went to all 5 National Park on this trip. I feel Canyonlands is by far the best. Fewer crowds and more to see. Make sure to hike out to ""The Grandview Point"" lookout. You will be amazed! And heed the warnings if you get off the main road. 4x4 is a must! ","October 3, 2019",Best of the 5 National Parks in southern Utah.,14,"Elizabethtown, Indiana",5
Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands NP is a large park and we only experienced the Needles section of it. This section is not a popular as the other sections so it is less crowded. We enjoyed the shorter hiking trails (3 of less than a mile and one that was about 2 miles) because of lack of time but the coloration of the rock formation was breathtaking. Because of the layering of the soil over time, many of the formations looked like mushrooms and we wonder how they stay that way. The road into this area is scenic but long, about 34 miles in Utah 211, but the speed limit goes up to 55 miles per hour so it does not take a lot of time. We stayed at a campsite along this highway so we did not have to travel the entire route to get back to the major highway (191). Also the park entrance was free the day we went because it was ""Public Lands Day"" but I have a senior pass, so it would have been free anyway. We actually enjoyed this National Park more than Arches NP which is about a couple of hours away.","October 3, 2019",Beautiful and Scenic,17,Arizona,5
Canyonlands National Park,The park is huge but from the main entrance /visitor center you can only get to a small percentage of the park without exiting and driving a long way to another entrance.,"October 2, 2019",Limited,0,,4
Canyonlands National Park,"While Canyonlands may not be as popular as Arches, it rivals Arches in views and beauty. We visited the Island in the Sky visitor center at the north entrance just because it was convenient for us. It did not disappoint in beauty but amenities were sparse. Be sure to pack your own sanitizers and wet wipes.The views were why we went and got what we wanted. One item on the top of our list here was a short (we thought) hike to Mesa Arch. The hike was a bit difficult for us as we both have mobility issues but we did it and it was worth it! The views across the canyon bottoms and rivers at Grand View Point were just icing on the cake.","October 2, 2019",Great views without crowds,57,"Topeka, Kansas",5

Canyonlands National Park,Very large park broken into three distinct districts. Visited Island in the Sky and the Needles Districts. Island in the Sky takes you across the canyon ridge. Fantastic views across the massive canyon. Native Anerican archeological sites. Relatively uncrowded. Easy access. Trails leading into the canyon descend many feet requiring fitness and preparation (food and water). The access road into the Needles District is approximately 60 miles from Moab and requires an additional 24 mile drive to reach the visitor center and trail heads. Your efforts won't be disappointed. Monumental formations lining the access road on the way in. Fantastic rock formation and endless canyons. Many of the trails here can be strenuous and not suitable for children or seniors. Make sure you bring plenty of water. The trails are well marked. Overall an unforgettable experience. ,"September 29, 2019",Awesome diverse huge park,1,"Virginia Beach, Virginia",5
Canyonlands National Park,"We heard so many mixed reviews about Canyonlands that we were only planning to spend half a day there. On the contrary, we enjoyed it just as much as Arches. I think perhaps those that were unable to take a few hikes would not have the fabulous impression that we had of Canyonlands. There are numerous hikes, long and short, easy and strenuous. Definitely park your car and do a little exploring. ","September 29, 2019",Loved it!,28,"Monument, Colorado",5
Canyonlands National Park,Fantastic trip and would recommend to Everyone! Their famous arch is arguably better than any in the arches park as the view when standing there is breathtaking so make sure you take the 10 minute walk there,"September 29, 2019",Stunning ,5,,5
Canyonlands National Park,"We decided to make the turn into Canyon lands on our way into Moab after visiting Zion and Bryce… Canyonlands was a bit anti-climactic after visiting the other two.

Canyonlands National Park,The great thing about Moab is there are so many outdoor activities so close. How many places can say there are two National Parks within 30 minutes. Canyonlands is a beautiful place. We went to Island in the Sky visitor center to start our adventure. So much beauty and different formations cause you wonder. Definitely bring plenty of water and snacks since you will be in the middle of nowhere. You will enjoy being there. ,"September 29, 2019",Enjoyable Canyonlands Visit ,41,"Roosevelt, Utah",5
Canyonlands National Park,"Mesa arch is the most photogenic arch in the area, particularly if you get there at dawn (or close to it).

Canyonlands National Park,This is the second year we have been to this park. Nice overlooks and stunning views off twisty winding roads that gradually rise in elevation as you go deeper into the park.

Canyonlands National Park,"There are two different entrances to this National Park the first off Hwy 191 travelling from Bluff to Moab. This has spectacular scenery all the way into the canyon until you reach the visitor centre where everything comes to an abrupt halt for a non 4 x 4 or ATV. It is a matter of turning round and heading back from whence you came. The second entry point is north of Moab about six miles passed the entrance to Arches National Park along Hwy 313. A long drive with very little to look at. Once in the park, across from the visitor centre there are magnificent views of the canyon below. Throughout the drive to the point of no return there are many vistas to take your breath away. Each part has its own charm.","September 28, 2019",Amazed at the views,295,"Farnborough, United Kingdom",4

Canyonlands National Park,"It really does feel as if you are on an Island in the Sky when you visit this district of Canyonlands National Park. It is appropriately named. This district of the park is a large mesa which is between the Colorado River and the Green River. Anywhere along the rim of the mesa you have a vista of canyons for miles and miles and a drop of about a 1,000 feet below you. I had forgotten my geology. I expected to be in the canyons. But a mesa is flat land on top and in this case grassy with juniper trees. The canyons were below and out beyond making for a breathtaking sight. This makes up the other approximately two-thirds of the park which is very remote and wild. The paved road allows you to drive to a number of overlooks until you come to the end of the mesa, and believe me its the end, at Grand View Point Overlook. Be sure to stop at the park visitor center shortly after entering the park for an orientation. Rangers are here to answer your questions. There is a nice gift shop/book store. Restrooms and water are here. Actually these are the best restrooms in the park. If you plan on doing any hiking, even a short hike, be sure to use sunscreen, wear a hat, and take plenty of water and a snack. Summertime temperatures can get extremely high. The nearest gas is in Moab, 37 miles from the park, so be sure you have plenty in your tank.","September 14, 2019",An Island in the Sky,172,"Milford, Delaware",5

Canyonlands National Park,"This is a huge national park so if you're limited for time you need to choose which section to visit. We spent a day each in both The Needles and Island of the Sky. The entrances are about 100 miles apart so you'd be pushed to cover both in a day. Each has its own visitor centre. There is also an area called the Maze but you need a high clearance 4WD and it's pretty remote.The Needles and Island of the Sky are quite different. The latter is probably more popular and provides sweeping panoramic views of the canyons. Aside from being awe-inspiring it gives you a better impression of the size and overall geology. There are some great short walks too. The mesa arch, upheaval dome and grand view point are not to be missed. We also enjoyed the 3.6 mile there and back Murphy Point, which is much less trafficked and has great views from the midway point on.The Needles has some lovely vistas but gets you closer to rock formations and features. It has fewer easier and more strenuous hikes. The best shorter hike is slick rock a 2.4 mile loop which provides a good overview of the main section of this side of the park. You should also drive to Elephant Hill. It's an unpaved track but fine for a regular car if taken slowly. The other highlight for us was the road that leads you to The Needles entrance with towering red cliffs that create a mouth dropping first impression. If I could only choose one part of the park to visit I guess it would have to be Island in the Sky, especially if you plan on visiting Arches NP, as you will see lots of rock formations there. We had an amazing visit and Canyonlands certainly rivals the Grand Canyon, in our opinion, and has fewer people.","September 13, 2019",In many ways more impressive than the Grand Canyon,546,"Chichester, United Kingdom",5

Canyonlands National Park,"GET THERE EARLY, WELL BEFORE SUNRISE if you want to get a premium spot to photograph!It will be well worth your efforts providing the weather cooperates. My experience included arriving about an hour or so before sunrise only to find a dozen or more photographers already set up. I was able to maneuver in and set up a tripod to get breathtaking photos! My photo as shown is a HRD photo comprised of 6 photos compressed into one using software. If you're not familiar with the process and you are serious about getting breathtaking photos you need to familiarize yourself with it. The small parking lot that's provided when we were there was somewhat difficult to find because of the pitch black darkness and the size of a small sign pointing the way. Because of the dark and not knowing where to go we eventually ended up right in front of the arch about a 1/4 mile hike through desert like terrain. Photographs deceive the size of the arch as it's much smaller than you'd think. WARNING: Shortly after sunrise bus loads of tourists showed up climbing all over the arch including on top of it. This really upset a lot of people including myself. It SHOULD NOT be allowed!!","September 12, 2019",Increadable sunrise viewpoint,36,"Lake Orion, Michigan",5

We spent 1/2 the day in the northern part of the park and drove to the southern part of the park. We much preferred the northern part. There were areas where you could picnic which was nice. Some of the parking lots were small which made finding a parking space challenging at times. If I had it to do over again, I would have spent more time in the northern part of the park and skipped the southern part.

Canyonlands National Park,Canyonlands national Park is an underrated attraction. All the stops within the park are beautiful. Mesa arch and grand view point are great. Our highlight was driving down Shafer canyon road down to the canyon floor and toward Moab. The view Is unbelievable. Seeing it from the bottom is totally different and the road follows the Colorado river which have some stunning views. You also see dead horse point upclose and the potash plant with its bright color ponds.

Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands National Park encompasses a massive area in south Utah; the most visited portion is a mesa called ""Island in the Sky"" (near Arches NP, about 30 minutes outside Moab UT). Though there are trails down into the canyon, visitors most often drive the park roads and stop at overlooks to view the canyons below. We spent about 3-4 hours here including a picnic at one scenic overview.One popular stop is the hike to Moab Arch. Though described as relatively easy, be prepared for a half-mile walk that was steep in places. If you go to the end of the trail you will be at/under the arch itself; we stopped uphill and got a good view of it. If you have time, drive 30 miles south of Moab and take the road to an overlook of the southern portion of Canyonlands called the Needles. The view is amazing with canyons stretching as far as you can see in three directions. There are a few picnic tables here so bring along lunch and enjoy the view.","August 23, 2019",Wonderful drive with amazing overlooks,59,"Madison, Wisconsin",5

It was all very peaceful until about 10 when more people arrived, including a massive SUV from Texas, which we encountered a couple of times, parking with the engine on and leaning out of the window to take photos. Takes all sorts we guess.We were far more impressed by the southern area (The Needles). It’s a wonderful drive into the canyon from the road (211). We wanted to hike so took the Slick Rock Trail and it was magnificent. Just follow the cairns for a couple of hours.

Canyonlands National Park,"I was impressed by the photo taken at the Green river overlook, then I decide I must go to this Canyonlands National park in some day, and finally I did it in this summer. The natural scenery is fantastic here, it has different districts, we have been to the Island in the sky and the Needles, the view at these 2 districts are totally different, so worth to go to both, while there are 2 more districts, but they are more remote, and required 4x4 high clearance vesicle to navigate. So if you want to explore more of the park, and drive thru' the white rim road, you need to have or rent a 4x4 high clearance vehicle. Overall, I think this park worth 4-4.5 stars of rating.","August 3, 2019",beautiful scenery,141,United States,4
Canyonlands National Park,"You'll need to drive 30 miles to reach the entry to Canyonlands National Park. That ride features amazing scenery both up to the mesas and down to the canyons 360 degrees as the road winds toward the Park. Once reached, the modest headquarters with the Park store has an excellent snapshot of how the amazing structures you will be encountering emerged. Our trusty ranger outlined a good course of combined drive and walk which pretty much covered the outstanding views and vistas......The loop road is ez for all vehicles. There are quite a few added roads and glorified trails which require 4 wheel drive and/or all terrain verhicles. THESE often require special permits. THESE also take you far into the wonderland of canyons upon canyons. The road weaves its way from highs to lows, from arches to canyons so deep you cannot see the bottoms. From scrub pines to aspens. There's no describing it. Canyonlands is like a visual reel of grand canyon like destinations....none similar....all breathtaking. Of note there's no food service AT ALL in the Park. There are plentiful bathrooms, all port-a-potties well kept along the various routes. The park map and acccompanying talking points are more than sufficient to get a real satisfying close up of what you are or will be seeing. For camera fans this would be about as good as it gets.IF THE FORCAST is for hot (90+) cloudless days visitors would be wise to cut short on the hiking and enjoy the scenery from the car. it is not only hot in this marvellous land but also VERY DRY.

Canyonlands National Park,"We stopped at the visitor center - which has a really cool gift shop and very friendly, knowledgeable rangers to help plan your trip. We spent about 6 hours driving through the park and doing short hikes. Because of a schedule mix-up with another activity, we actually ended up going about 7 a.m. (otherwise we would have gone much later in the morning). This turned out to be perfect, because there were not many people, and it was not too hot. As we were leaving, mid-afternoon, there was a long line of cars streaming in. Whew - glad to have missed that. Really a lovely park. We both thought, and then also overheard someone else say - this seems more spectacular than the Grand Canyon. It's pretty amazing. Bring a lot of water. I drank about 50 ounces and was still thirsty. You should also pack food. I think this park is easier to navigate than most. We did the ISLANDS IN THE SKY side. The NEEDLES entrance is about a 2.5 hour drive. You can't really do both in a single day.","July 25, 2019",Drove through the park and found it easy to navigate,17,Michigan,5

Here are a few things I wouldn't miss: 1 - stop by the Island in the Sky Visitor Center. The'll have a board there with recommended hikes for various stages of life. It gave us some great ideas. 2 - Stop at Aztec Butte. We didn't hike to the second butte, but the first one with the granary was pretty cool, and all the kids liked it. We didn't want to wear ourselves out by hiking up the 2nd butte that day. 3 - You can see Whale Rock from the road, so you don't actually have to GO to it. 4 - My husband and I left the kids at a picnic table and quickly went up to Upheaval Dome. It's really cool! Worth the little hike. 5 - Buck Canyon Overlook had some really cool, big drop offs. 6 - Grand View Overlook was pretty cool, too.","July 25, 2019",This place is BIG!,13,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

Canyonlands National Park,"We spent two full days in Canyonlands. On the first we visited The Needles section from Monticello, before driving up to Moab to finish the day. The following day we spent in The Island in the Sky section.The Needles is interesting and had some good hiking trails. Be warned though, it is very tough work! It's a fairly long drive in from Monticello, but nothing to put you off. I would definitely come here if you have time, but not an absolute must-see - 4 stars for this part.The Island in the Sky is much more immediately spectacular. Incredible views and some great walks, particularly along the rim from Grandview Point. Mesa Arch is also worth seeing, but of course crowded.The highlight for us though I think was the epic drive down Shafer Canyon Road back to Moab. We hadn't planned to do this but at the visitor centre in the morning the ranger was unusually positive about the ease of traveling on a road marked as 4WD only. We were very open that we had a Toyota Rav4, which is automatic AWD with moderate clearance - i.e. not a true 4x4. He told us it would be easy, and he was right. Absolutely great recommendation and really good to not have a ranger hiding behind what the road sign / map says but judging current conditions on their merits. This road takes you right past the amazing 'Goosenecks' in the river that you would see from Dead Horse Point state park, which saved us a trip. The descent to this point is the really epic part though, and one we're so glad we got to do","July 24, 2019",Amazing variety in a vast national park,292,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",5

It is easier and not as steep as the path to the right most people take. It also has the markers about trees and other plants.National Park Service: some benches along these trails would be really, really nice!

It was not a difficult hike, and we enjoyed it. It ends on a peninsula several hundred feet above the canyon floor.We saw Mesa Arch last, and it was my favorite. I took a few pictures, then when a group of rude tourists moved out of the way (illegally climbing the arch), I walked up to it and peeked through. The view took my breath away. I quickly took some photos, drank in the view, then cleared out so that other photographers could do the same. The hike is a half mile loop, mostly in soft sand.

There are 3 separate entrances, with each having their own offerings of activity, so research and decide which works for you. We went to the Island in the Sky entrance and the scenic drive there. There are a few stops for views, and an arch to walk to. It is really beautiful, and as far as I'm concerned, rivals the Grand Canyon. There aren't many services, much less ""civilized"" than the Grand Canyon, but much more nicely rugged and wild I think. We took the Shafer Trail back to Moab (see my review!!!).

Canyonlands National Park,"Taking a back seat to nothing, Canyonlands National Park is stunningly beautiful. There are gorgeous views (or perhaps I should say GORGE-ous views) everywhere, and the more you drive or walk or hike, the more of them you'll discover. A nice bonus to visiting this particular national park is the fact that it is far less busy than others in the region, such as Arches or Bryce or Zion.This particular national park has TWO separate entrances, each wholly inaccessible to the other. In addition, the views and scenery in the two areas are quite different from one another. We spent Day 1 (all of it) at the northern entrance, enjoying that part of Canyonlands, and we spent Day 2 (all of it) at the southern entrance (near to Moab), enjoying that part of Canyonlands just as much. Because the two areas are so different, it is well worth the visit to both of them.If you're physically able to do so, getting out and enjoying some of the walking / hiking paths is incredibly rewarding. The views to be had from doing that are breathtaking and absolutely worth the effort. We wouldn't have missed taking those hikes (we opted for the ones graded ""easy"") for anything in the world!Would-be visitors might want to take note of a few things:1. There is very limited, if indeed, any cell phone service in most areas of the park. If you go in expecting to have no service, you won't be caught off guard.2. Bring water and snacks with you for the day. It's a fairly time-consuming drive in/out of the park, particularly the southern entrance, and there are no services available once you're inside.3. Plan on at least a half-day visit, and build time into your schedule to stay longer if possible. Nobody would want to rush through the beauty of Canyonlands!4. The weather changes REALLY fast and REALLY unexpectedly here. It is not at all uncommon for a day to begin bright and sunny, and to have rain showers and/or thunderstorms by the afternoon.","June 17, 2019",Be sure to visit BOTH routes accessing Canyonlands!,77,"Silver Spring, Maryland",5

We really enjoyed the Grand View area where we could take a hike along the rim (watch out!) but man was it beautiful.

We nearly skipped this park in order to save time and get to Bryce earlier, I'm so glad we didn't. Did not do much hiking in this park, I'd call it more walking. We did the short walk to the Mesa arch which was nice but having come from Arches it's just not as impressive as any arch over in Arches. What did impress me was the views at the Grand View Point. Drive the scenic road all the way to the end to the circular parking lot and walk some or all of the walk along the rim. I could not believe the views, we went all the way to the end of the trail by making a right out of the parking lot. This place seems like an absolute haven for 4-wheeling, up on the rim walk at the grand view point we could hear the engines down in the canyon and see the jeeps (which looked like ants from up there).

Canyonlands National Park,"If staying at Moab, Canyounlands is only about 30 minute further drive than Arches but may be quicker to access due to the long lines at Arches. It does not offer as many unique attractions, but it does great overlooks and an impressive arch. Unless going into the canyon, the hikes are flat and easy. Not having crowded trails like Arches is a real plus. The staff at the visitor center are very helpful with trail and things to see recommendations and weather information.

Canyonlands National Park,We originally were not going to visit Canyonlands and a friend suggested we should. I am I glad we took her advice. We made time in our itinerary and it certainly was worth the visit. It is a little bit of a drive from Moab but the road is very good. The sights are spectacular and even better than what has been described. The canyons simply take your breath away. The points of interest are well signed and in most cases easy to get to. The visitor center do a very good job in providing information and I suggest stopping to get some additional tips. Good hiking boots or shoes are a must as is a wide brimmed hat.

We didn't have the luxury of a really beautiful day, it was overcast, but I can imagine the majesty of this park. Even the drive to the park is amazing, passing the citadel cliffs that seem to stand guardian over the roads. Easy to be distracted just driving there.

This is a park that reminds us of the Grand Canyon, Arches, and Monument Valley; it has a little of everything. Yet 2 stops really stand out for us. Dead Horse Point had gorgeous views of the various canyons below. It's a state park that you can visit on the way to the NP. The other place is Mesa Arch. Wow! It's a very short hike from the car and worth the effort. It's a beautiful arch you can look through to the canyons below. And the drop looking down from the arch is a deep one. For a photographer this is a must see!! I can only imagine that a view through this arch as the sun rises in the east must be an amazing sight for all. I'm not sure what time of year is best for this, but no matter. It was great for the 4 of us getting our own spectacular pictures. Imagine a wildly colorful canyon viewed through an amazing arch of ancient rock. It was the highlight of our Canyonlands visit.

I found a suggested itinerary in a National Geographic National Parks book that recommended driving to the end of the road, Grand View Point Overlook, and working back toward the park entrance, ending with Mesa Arch and Shafer Canyon Overlook. This worked well to get me largely ahead of the crowd and interspersed scenic views with short hikes. If I return to Canyonlands, I plan to book an off-road tour. From our vantage points high above the canyon floors, we could sometimes see the tours traversing the landscape.

Canyonlands National Park,"I almost did not want to write this because I want to keep this place all to myself. Canyonlands is hands-down the most spectacular hauntingly beautiful place in the whole world. I've been to the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Sequoia, Yellowstone, Arches, Hawaii, but none of them compare to the beauty and majesty of Canyonlands. All of them trust me are beautiful beautiful places, but I have a very soft spot for Canyonlands. We were there 3 years ago, and we vowed to return soon as we got more travel money. Needles is where you immerse yourself. Chesler Park trail is absolutely a definite must-see !!! (I think it's a 6-7 mile hike). And the Druid Arch trail is also a very good one (11 mile hike). Both are strenuous hikes, but trust me, it is worth it !! There is plenty of amazing things to see while hiking, and some fun climbing, and scrambling rocks. I think Canyonlands might just be my favorite place on Earth ! Grand View Point also was beautiful in Islands in the Sky. Take plenty of water and snacks with you during your hikes. Your visit will be so well worth it. Also make sure you check that the forecast do not predict rain.....flash floods are very dangerous in the slot canyons.","May 4, 2019",Breathtaking and hauntingly beautiful,0,,5

We visited the park at the end of March, during Spring Break, and encountered temperatures between 50 and 60 degrees. It is a brief dirt road you will have to drive on but it’s even ok with a regular car. There will be limited parking but well worth the visit. Don’t forget a cooler with food, water and snacks. There are a few picnics areas in the area. Overall, awesome place to see, plan at least 1-2 days of sightseeing and hiking. But this place is so massive there is so much to see and do.

If you have kids be sure not to miss out on the Junior ranger programme, it's a great way to keep the kids involved as you go around the park. You get a little activity book for them to fill out as you go around and at the end they get presented with a junior ranger badge. My kids still wear them around the place. Made for great memories for them and we all learned something. What I love about this place was even though it was peak season in July this park didn't seem as jammed busy as Arches.

Our favorite sight was the Mesa Arch. Easy hike to a breathing spot. We were too tired to take in any other hikes so we just enjoyed the other sights from the viewpoints. We also felt a little tired b/c the altitude in most of the park is around 5,800 to close to 7,000 feet elevation. They don't really say much about this in the park, but being from below sea level this really affects us differently and is noticeable. Most of the hikes are really long and strenuous.

We saw a recommendation in one of the tourist magazines for an iOS app called GyPSy Arches Canyonlands Combo. It's a GPS guided tour that runs on your iPhone with downloaded maps and does not require a cell phone connection. I installed the app at the hotel the night before. It only cost $8. It guided us from downtown Moab, through Canyonlands Island in the Sky District and back. We went at our own pace and listened to the tour through the car radio. First stop is the Visitor Center for a free map and information. Great staff. Highlights were Monitor and Merimac, Shaefer Canyon, Mesa Arch, Buck Canyon, Grand View Point and Upheaval Dome. On a weekend watch all the UTVs navigate the switchbacks in Shaefer Canyon. We only went on the easy hikes. There are plenty of serious hikes that could turn Canyonlands into a weeklong visit.

Not one rock formation is alike another and each one deserves your undivided attention.We did both Island in the Sky and the Needles and both offered plenty of easy trails that we could hike with our boys (5 and 8) like the Pothole Point Trail, with its incredible tale of life stubbornly surviving in small ponds of fresh water carved in the limestone, or the longer scenic Slickrock Trail in the Needles and the iconic Mesa Arch in Island in the Sky. My kids also loved scrambling on the White Wale not far from Upheaval Dome which overlooks an ancient meteorite impact crater, or so some believe.We were there in March and we underestimated somewhat the altitude with snow flakes and then hail on the first day alternating with warm sunny spells, that turned into rain and then plain warm Spring weather... just be prepared for whatever the weather throws at you.Do stop at the Visitor Center as the rangers there are really extremely helpful and welcoming.","April 15, 2019","Breath it in, hike, contemplate, repeat",28,"Brooklyn, New York",5

Watching the golden sun set over the red rocks was amazing. Also, be sure to take the easy, quick hike to the Mesa Arch. Although it’s small the view is amazing.

Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands is something special. The views and vistas from the rim are so big its hard to comprehend. It reminds you a little of the Grand Canyon but the canyon walls are farther apart so it makes it seem even more vast but also mutes the colors somewhat. There are also formations in the rock that will remind you of Bryce, Zion, Capitol Reef and Arches. Its like getting a sampler of all of Utah's National Parks. We did the hike to the end of Grand View Point as well as the short walk to Mesa Arch. Both are must sees.

And I’ve mostly seen only what’s convenient from the road, though I made an exception yesterday. There is the vast majority of the park beyond reach of the road but accessible to four wheel drive vehicles, hiking, mountain bikes and river rafts.

The park map describes well which roads are safe for passenger cars. There is a lot of area accessible by off-road vehicles and available to serious backcountry enthusiasts.

Don't miss the Mesa Arch - easy hike and so incredible. A must is the WHALE rock - had a really fun time hiking with the kids here. Saw the crater and then to the valley overlook which was amazing as you look over cliffs to the canyons below.

Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands is a huge National Park with two vehicle-accessible regions; the northern ""Island in the Sky"" area and the southern ""The Needles"" area. This review focuses on the ""Islands"" region. Going north from Moab on 191, it's 5 miles to Arches National Park and about another 7 miles to Rt. 313, where you'll turn left as you continue to the Canyonlands Visitor Center, about 20 miles distant. On the way in on 313, several miles before you get to Canyonlands Visitor Center, you'll have the opportunity to visit Dead Horse Point State Park, a separate $20 admission (per vehicle) that is well worth it. DON'T MISS THIS! This is where you'll get the spectacular, iconic view of the Colorado River's ""Gooseneck"" Bend 2,000 feet below. Gorgeous!As for Canyonlands itself, the views of majestic canyons should not be missed! There are plenty of overlooks where you can get out of your car and marvel at a canyon view. For serious hikers, almost limitless opportunities; plenty of short trails, too.TIP: It's easy enough to do Arches National Park (see my separate review) and Canyonlands ""Island"" area (and Dead Horse Point State Park) all in one day. Figure about 3.5 hours for Arches in the morning and the rest of the day for Canyonlands and Dead Horse. Take food and drink with you so you don't have to backtrack into Moab for lunch; that will save you lots of time. While we didn't visit the southern ""Needles"" part of the park, we did go part way to view ""Newspaper Rock"", a large petroglyph panel just 12 miles off highway 191 on Rt. 211, the road that leads into the Needles area. The petroglyphs are easily accessed from a parking lot immediately adjacent to the petroglyphs. If you're driving from Moab to Mesa Verde, or other southern points, this is a quick trip that is well worth doing. The petroglyphs are well preserved and interesting.Bottom line, combining Arches, Canyonlands and Dead Horse Point into one day makes for tons of beautiful scenery. Summer traffic may slow you down a bit, but you'll have a great day doing this. Highly Recommended! Enjoy!","March 22, 2019",Gorgeous Canyon Views,510,"Plymouth, Michigan",5

I loved it and was with my granddaughter. So fascinating, beautiful, and totally different terrain. I am so blessed to get to see so many of God's creations and experience them first hand. I am an artist so I appreciate the beauty of the sky, landscape, & atmosphere so much. Even the drive to these is incredible with the autumn golden colors in the leaves and beautiful backdrops. So thankful I got to experience this while staying at Red Cliffs Lodge in Moab, which is the PLACE to stay while there.

The surroundings are breathtaking, but on such a grand scale that they are a bit overwhelming. We drove to the furthest extent of the park, to Slickrock Trail. This hike took about 2 hours to complete along smooth rocky surfaces. These are marked out by route markers of quaint stone piles. Well worth a trip, but be aware that the Visitors' Centre is about 25 miles from the main road and Slickrock Trail a further 6.5 miles from there.

But one word of advice: don't even go there in the afternoon. The magic of Mesa Arch comes before, and perhaps 90 minutes after, sunrise! Is it worth the early wakeup and drive? Trust me. It will change your life. And even if there are lots of folks gathered there at sunrise, most will ""get their shots"" and wander off, leaving its near perfection to YOU.

The park was very busy and there was a ranger directing parking at the trail head. You couldn't go in unless someone came out. He suggested we go back to Orange Cliffs overlook which we did and found a parking spot. If the park was crowded I suggest stopping at the Orange Cliffs parking lot and walking to Grand View Point.

We drove the length of the park road, taking full advantage of turn-off areas to do short hikes to natural wonders (such as Mesa Arch) and to gaze at spectacular scenery from numerous overlooks. We particularly enjoyed the hike from the Grand View Point Overlook which provided us with the most breathtaking views of Canyonlands.

Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands National Park, located north of Moab and Arches National Park, covers 337,598 acres and preserves a colorful landscape eroded into countless canyons, mesas and buttes by the Colorado River, the Green River and their respective tributaries. Established in 1964, it is divided into four districts--Island in the Sky, Needles, Maze and the combined rivers, Green and Colorado, which carved two large canyons into the Colorado Plateau. While these areas share a primitive desert atmosphere, each retains its own character. Author Edward Abbey, a frequent visitor, described the Canyonlands as ""the most weird, wonderful, magical place on earth--there is nothing else like it anywhere."" While more remote than nearby Arches National Park and not as celebrated as Yellowstone or the Grand Canyon, Canyonlands continues to attract more and more visitors each year with more than 3/4 million in 2018. It is a popular recreational destination for hiking, mountain biking, backpackers and 4-wheelers always eager to challenge the rugged, remote trails. White Rim Road traverses the White Rim Sandstone level between the rivers and Island in the Sky. Rafters and kayakers float the calm waters of the Green and Colorado rivers above the confluence. Below the confluence, Cataract Canyon contains powerful whitewater rapids similar to the rapids in the Grand Canyon. Aesthetically, other notable sites in Canyonlands include Newspaper Rock, Grand View Point Overlook, Druid Arch, Great Gallery, Hare Canyon, Chocolate Drops, Mesa Arch, Shafer Canyon and Trail and Molar and Angel Arch. A geographically detached section of the park located west-northwest of the main districts is Horseshoe Canyon, which contains panels of rock art made by hunter-gatherers from the Late Archaic Period (2,000-1,000 BC), predating the Ancestral Puebloans. Horseshoe's artifacts, dwellings, pictographs and murals are some of the oldest in America. It is believed that images depicting horses date from after 1,540 AD, after the Spanish introduced horses to America. Mammals that roam in the park include black bears, coyotes, skunks, bats, elk, bobcats, foxes, cougars, badgers, pronghorn antelope and mule deer. At least 273 species of birds inhabit the park, including a variety of hawks, eagles and owls. There also are 11 species of lizards, eight of snake and six of amphibians. It all makes for a very busy and eye-opening and sometimes exhausting experience in a landscape unlike any other.","October 18, 2018","""There is nothing else like it anywhere""",4679,"Chicago, Illinois",5

There are basically 3 sections to the park, Island in the Sky, The Maze and The Needles. We decided to do The Needles portion of the park because 1) it was still raining and Island in the Sky was better viewed when sunny, 2) The Maze was further west and was better suited for off road vehicles, 3) The Needles was the furthest south and got us closer to Durango without backtracking. We drove to the Cave Spring short hike. It was fun because they had some of the old cowboy camps that were under the ledges and then you could climb up on top of the rocks and get some good views. Did I mention that the weather was not cooperating...again. From there we drove to Pothole Point. This was an easy hike and relatively flat, but it did give you some great views of the different topography of the park. Every once in a while a few streaks of sunshine would break through, but not where we were. From there we went over to Big Spring Canyon Overlook. There is a trailhead down to Confluence Overlook, which is about 11 miles round trip. We decided to take a pass based on time. At Big Spring Canyon Overlook be aware of the Ravens. They are big and somewhat aggressive. They will follow you to your car thinking you may have food.On the way out we stopped at Wooden Shoe Overlook which looks just like a wooden shoe.

We spent a day and a half wandering round the location and that was 'just' the Island in the Sky area - don't forget there is also the often overlooked Needles area further south than this. One gets a fabulous overview of the vastness of the place from the Grand Overlook - a short, relatively flat walk which ends in an amazing viewpoint across much of the Island in the Sky area - but don't forget the Mesa Arch in the area nor the other overlooks that pepper the rods through this northern part of the park. There are trails a plenty but, due to the incredibly hot conditions while we were there, we limited ourselves to the more simple hikes as there is little to no shade anywhere in the area. Take plenty of water and just enjoy natures grandeur at approaching it's most visibly stunning best.","October 11, 2018",Just overwhelming,19,"Burmarsh, United Kingdom",5
Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands was my husbands favorite park of the trip. He loved the view from Mesa Arch. There was a big t-storm that rolled thru Moab on the morning we went to Canyonlands so we did not make Mesa Arch for sunrise like was the plan. We toured the whole park and made a pact to make right turns only this day so we got to Mesa Arch about 1:00 and it was packed. There were people everywhere which did detract a little from my enjoyment. However, overall fewer people than at arches and the scenery was gorgeous throughout the entire park.","October 10, 2018",fantastic scenery,19,Michigan,5
Canyonlands National Park,"My wife and I visited Moab for a few days recently as part of a week-long western adventure, visiting Canyonlands and Arches National Parks before heading south and spending a few days at the Grand Canyon. During our first day in Moab, we hiked in the Island in the Sky section of Canyonlands. I had seen pictures of Canyonlands, but they pale in comparison to actually being there. The views were spectacular and I would love to see another part of the park at some point. After leaving Moab and driving south, we saw a sign off the highway for the Needles Overlook. Despite the 20 mile drive off the highway to get there, we decided to go and it was well worth the detour.","October 10, 2018",Even more beautiful than I had expected!,2,"Shrewsbury, Massachusetts",5
Canyonlands National Park,"There are two parts to Canyonlands - Island in the Sky and Needles, each of which has its own entrance. We went to both. Island in the Sky is okay unless you have seen the Grand Canyon and then it pales by comparison, but looks very similar. Needles, on the other hand, I feel is the better of the two. Very different scenery from the other one or the Grand Canyon. Were I to do it again I would choose the Needles park.","October 10, 2018","Nice, but may not exceed expectations, depending.",6,,4

Don't bother comparing Cristiano Ronaldo to Messi - just enjoy both. I would say a car is must-have. For fun, find a quiet spot (of which there are many), and shout as loud as you can.

Canyonlands National Park,"Last year we did Arches but missed Canyonlands and Dead Horse Point so we came back. Canyonlands is effectively three separate parks and you probably need a day for each one because they aren't connected inside the overall park and some of the connecting roads are like 100 miles. Also you need to fill up water bottles at the Visitor Center, especially in summer.We had some problems that prohibited walking trails so we just did the lookouts, two of which we could not find from the map provided at the entrance. But we found nine (I think) and that was enough to get a good perspective of the scenery. Its 34 miles from the most remote point back to the highway and then another 11 to Moab from memory so you need to allow at least four hours and more likely the whole day, especially if you include Dead Horse Point which we had seen the day before.

Canyonlands National Park,"It is an extraordinary environment with no water source at all. We were warned, to have our water and food supply, since there is no possibility to get a drink or any food. It is a miracle, how the unusual plants were able to adapt to these arid conditions and how some animals can exist in this high desert. To watch this desperate fight to stay alive and propagate, was nearly as impressive as the mind-blowing landscape. Since I wasn’t in my best walking condition, we just used the car to get from one viewpoint to the other one. From a distance, the incredibly blue color of the potash ponds fired up my curiosity.T his is that you used to describe, that too blue to be true, Moab is soo much surrounded these natural beauties, that it is always a hard decision where to go? To the arches N.P., or Canyonlands, or Dead Horse Point?

Canyonlands National Park,"First visit to the park and we went in the north entrance. The park is 31 miles from the turnoff and Hwy 191. Stop by the visitor center and fill up with water. You’ll need it and more. Best planning across the Island in the Sky is to drive south 11.3 miles to the end of the road at Grand View Point. The trail is absolutely stunning with vistas completely along the trail. Approximately 50 stairs total will take you along the edge of the world with shear cliff drop offs. The hike is approximately 2 miles round trip, and very easy. Check out the roadside pullouts for spectacular views of the park and landscape. If you have any energy left after Grandview Point, take the hike up to Upheaval Dome. Moderately stressful 2 mile round trip hike. Good soles shoes are a must, and take plenty of water. Top off your visit to the Island in the Sky is a visit to Mesa Arch. A quick .5 mile hike to a spectacular Arch. If you’re really adventurous, take the White Rim road drive.

Not only that but with some of the sheer dropoffs it was nice to have an experienced driver. We went the first week of September and there were no crowds anywhere.

The whale rock trail at the island of the sky was my favorite. The view from there is wonderful. We stayed to watch the sunset but be sure and take a light with you as it gets very dark quickly. We had to use our trail gps to get back to the car. The stars were the most beautiful from this whale rock parking area that I had ever seen in my life. I hope to go back to this park again.

Canyonlands National Park,"My wife and I have made an effort to hit our national parks, and have made it through 40 of 59; this is in our top 3. Many better known parks suffer from success.. buses of tourists in the way, full parking lots, and rules preventing (er, protecting) you from seeing the best of the park. Yosemite,Yellowstone, Zion, and even Arches suffer from this. Canyonlands is far out enough that it filters many of the selfie-seekers out. Best of all, if you have a high clearance vehicle, and are prepared... the 4x4 trails are amazing beyond words. DONT GO OUT if you are not prepared (4x4, tow strap, food/water, GPS, etc); but if you are, the Schafer Trail, White Rim, and anywhere along the edge of the Green River will reward your efforts. If you're tired of the crowds spoiling your time away, do your homework and make a trip into the outback of Canyonlands... you'll be amazed. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (IF YOU ARE PREPARED!).","September 3, 2018","Beautiful, sublime, and best of all... not crowded.",100,"Bonn, Germany",5
Canyonlands National Park,"Visiting Canyonlands requires patience, but will be a rewarding experience. The first thing to be aware of is the Park is in two more or less separate sections. Moab is the closest town, but its not that close. It requires a good hour to reach the entrance to the Needles subdivision from Moab, a little bit less to get to the Island in the Sky subdivision. Although park maps show dirt roads that connect the Needles subdivison more directly to Moab these roads require both a permit and a sturdy four-wheel drive vehcile.  Both divisions offer wonderful views the high desert, but are brutally hot during the summer. Visitor's centers in both parks provide bathrooms, advice and water, but do not have any sort of restaurant facilities so bring whatever food you want. The Needles subdivision has a privately run facility near the entrance that can provide both gas and food. Make sure you have lots of fuel in your car, cold water and food in these areas because you are far from anywhere with tow truck or medical care. Be warned that some navigation programs show some services (gas) at La Sal Junction near Needles entrance, but there are in fact none there. Also be warned that their is no cell phone service in much of the park. Make sure you get a map at the visitors center and know how to read it.For people interested in Native American culture a rock wall covered with wonderfully preserved petroglyphs is located few miles from the Needles entrance. The subdivision also includes some small puebloean ruins. These are intersting, but don't compare with the structures you will find at Chaco Canyon, Mesa Verde and Hovenweep.","September 2, 2018",Great Desert Views,8,,4

Canyonlands National Park,"We spent Labor Day in Moab, indulging our national park obsession. We originally planned to head to Canyon Lands on Sunday, but after canyoneering was cut short with the threat of rain, we headed over. The drive from Moab to Canyonland is nice. Despite the holiday weekend, we had little traffic and some nice scenery. We were also pleasantly surprised to find no back-up at the entrance despite arriving there around noon on the Saturday of Labor Day Weekend.The kids vetoed any hiking so we took the scenic overlook approach. The first one in the park past the visitors center is super cool - where you get to walk out onto a rock island and start to experience Canyonlands. We continued to Grand View, only expecting to take a look. However, when we got there we decided that the 2-mile roundtrip hike out and back was worth it. The kids did about 1/4 of the hike, then found some shade and plopped down. The walk was moderate and worth it. We visited a super small portion of the park - but it was incredible. Our next trip hopefully will be the 2-day Shaffer trail. ","September 2, 2018",Labor Day Visit to Moab,47,"Denver, Colorado",5
Canyonlands National Park,"My wife and I visited Canyonlands National Park in May 2018. Leaving the Moab Paleosafari restaurant down Hwy 313, you enter a land of almost immediate beautiful desolation. Just entering the zone you can see Mesas and the beautiful red rock of the canyons, with arid brush grass on the sides of the road. The drive from the junction of 191 & 313 (the ""entrance"") will take a while to reach the actual entrance into the National Park (though you are already in it, technically) - approx. ~20 to 30 miles down 313. As we did with all National Parks we saw on this trip, my wife and I took our picture next to the large, beautiful brown sign on the side of the road announcing you are in Canyonlands National Park. The National Park was established in 1964 by President Lyndon Johnson, and is broken up into four districts - Island in the Sky being the one we mainly stayed in. The crowds at Canyonlands is minimal at best - it is much further out than Arches is from Maob - though in relation, everything in Utah is at a distance from each other. When arriving to the pay station - and the park rangers talking with us, giving us a map and tips - civilization is nowhere in site around you - only the tranquil canyons and dry, cool air as wind was washing over the road. After entering the park, we entered the Island in the Sky Visitor Center, bought a few souvenirs - a couple mugs, a few magnets, postcards, etc., and then took our car and began driving through park (starting closest with the Shafer Canyon Overlook). I have never seen such beautiful, otherworldly scenes in my life - the striations of the canyon rocks (reds, beiges & greens), layered beneath you and rippling ahead of you in all directions is breathtaking. Caution is always recommended, as when you are on the edge of a cliff, there is not much holding you back, so beware. The distances on the driving paths are fairly long - from Shafer it is approx. 6 miles to the junction between Buck Canyon Overlook & Whale Rock (Green River Overlook basically at the junction point). Take time to drive along the routes - and there are many places to pull over, giving you time to explore, walk around, and enjoy the beautiful views. Each part of Island in the Sky - from Shafer to Whale to Buck Canyon - look incredibly different. Buck Canyon Overlook amazing - imagine any scene of ""Mars"" in a Hollywood film, and this is what you view here. Ancient sea beds and river chalk out the arid, desert landscape of deep browns & reds, with the canyon on many parts steep-faced, with a slight angle as it reaches its base. Multi-layers of canyon floors and buttes mark this amazing point in Canyonlands. This was our first National Park on our trip out West, and was one of the best - compared to Arches, Canyonlands is far superior in sites to see, tranquility and overall minimal crowds, even on a busy weekend. When we come out to Utah again, we will definitely visit Canyonlands, possibly making a trek into the Maze or Needles. Thank you!","September 1, 2018",Amazing National Park!

Canyonlands National Park,"Unbelievable experience with my girlfriends and a wrangler jeep. My friend courageously drove down the side of the mountain on the Shafer trail. We certainly would not have tried this without a jeep due do it loose gravel. We went first thing in the morning around 8 so there was no one around which made it great. We are city drivers so this was a big step. I drove back up the same trail. Challenging but manageable. The views were breathtaking. We drove along the Shafer Trail until Musselman Arch ( next time I would love to spend the day on the trail) and then we went on the roads in the area of Island in the sky. Beautiful views! No guard rails so be careful with children and yourself as you approach any edges. Looking through Mesa Arch was like a giant eye looking out onto what I imagine Mars to look like. We had packed up lots of water, snacks and food because we spent about 8 hours in the Park. There were washrooms but not many so take advantage of them when you can. Not much protection from the sun so a hat is great.

Canyonlands National Park,"We spent one day exploring the Needles District (south end) and the next day exploring the Island in the Sky District (north end). Because of age, health concerns & August desert temps, my partner and I explored Canyonlands mostly by car, though we did do a few .3-.5 mile walks. At the Needles Visitor Center, we spent about 30-45 minutes chatting with staff and looking at the exhibits, then hopped in our rental car to begin exploring. The 2-way blacktop roads are excellent, as were parking areas throughout. Newspaper Rock was of special interest - esp once we noticed how many footprint pictographs had 6 toes! Overall, the topography is fascinating. I don't care how great photos and video are, you still need to experience it - esp in this time when protection of our public lands and national parks are under threat. It reawakens an appreciation for the land and its ecosystems and for the vast sky that our fast-paced lifestyles tend to overshadow. The skies were sometimes quite hazy, thanks to smoke from Calif and other wildfires and served to remind us of how fragile life can be. The next day we toured the larger Island in the Sky District which seemed much bigger than Needles and definitely had a lot more visits (mostly foreign). The Visitor Center is bigger too. The roads and parking were just as excellent. Island in the Sky was our favorite of the 2 districts because of all the majestic views. In fact, the only complaint I heard from my partner was that he felt a bit overwhelmed by so much majesty. Like Arches, revisiting Canyonlands was on our bucket list, so we were very happy we were able, even though mostly by car this time.

One potential improvement : increase the parking space at several of the viewpoints.

We never made it to The Needles, it was a longer drive than we wanted to undertake from Moab (maybe an hour 40 minutes, if I recall correctly). The Island in the Sky portion is about a 45 minute drive from Moab. The canyons look enormous to me! They are beautiful.

Both are fabulous. Special mention to the iconic Mesa arch, where I spent several hours before sunrise to capture the glorious day break. Weather was warm and we avoided hiking during the afternoon. The park offers several scenic drives and hikes of different challenge levels. Key thing to note that there is no food or drinks available inside the park.

Canyonlands National Park,"We had benefitted from an early start at Arches the day before so had the same intent on the day of our visit. We had a delay so we were unable to make sunrise at Mesa Arch but arrived just as people were exiting from taking their sunrise pictures. This turned out to be a good time as there were not very many of us there an the hike/walk to the arch which was the main event of our visit. We were able to get one of the best pictures of our trip sitting in front of Mesa Arch. We drove the whole road and pulled off at some viewpoints, of course the one at the end of the road. You can make as much or as little that you want of your visit as we felt very satisfied with that plan but I’m sure others took advantage of some longer hikes. Our grandson did the JR Ranger book and I’d recommend downloading it from the internet if you plan to go before the Visitor Center opens..

A single, breathtaking arch and right below it -- and behind it -- a giant drop-off in the landscape.

I did see a few trails where you could hike but not many people appeared to be taking advantage of it. Perhaps because it was a hundred degrees out (mid-July).

Would highly recommend Island in the Sky-- its absolutely gorgeous. Really wanted to go to the Needles but didn't have enough time :( Also spent some time at Mesa Arch & whale rock. Definitely have lots of rocks to climb, if you're into that sort of thing. Spent time talking to some astronomy students and we looked at the sun through a microscope. I've never been to the Grand Canyon, but it looks comparable. Didn't get to go to Dead Horse either, but it is super close to Canyonlands.

The park itself has a couple of sections. The north half, Islands in the Sky is remarkably different from nearby Arches NP. To my eye, I enjoyed it a bit more. The southern section, Needles, has some amazing rock formations. There are a couple of views of Needles from BLM lands that should not be missed. One suggestion is that visitors should do a little research on hiking trails before they come and plan on doing their hiking early in the day.

Don't make the mistake of passing this up, well worth the easy and beautiful drive, away from the massive crowds of Arches and close enough where you can do both but save Canyonlands as your base.

Canyonlands National Park,"Beautiful park, and at times we felt was prettier than the Grand Canyon. There are beautiful vistas every where that you see and lot of opportunities to hike too. We would definitely wish to come back next time with a 4 wheel drive vehicle to drive the off road trails that looked so cool. If you are visiting both Canyonlands and Arches($30 each), do look towards buying an annual pass for $80 - you can visit any national park for a year. We visited both the Islands in the Sky and the Needles visitor center in one day. It is a long drive of 2 hours between the two. I would suggest just doing Islands in the Sky if you have a day, since there is so much to do there and the scenery is much prettier in Islands in the Sky. But the drive to Needles is superb and absolutely worth going to Needles just for it. Needles needs more time to hike to enjoy that part of the park, but we did do short hikes there and almost had the whole park to ourselves with very few visitors. That really enhanced our experience in the park.","July 8, 2018",Loved it!,13,Arizona,5

I don't remember the trail name but make sure you see the Arch. Great views through the window of the arch looking down towards the Colorado River. The Colorado River is in the bottom of the East side but very hard to see in most locations. This park does allow OHV's and other 4x4 vehicles to access the lower roads along the river which is really cool. I think this is a 1 day stop to see most the sites and get in a few smaller hikes.

Canyonlands National Park,This park has three sections. This year we only visited Island in the Sky. The overlooks here are absolutely spectacular. The Grandview overlook puts you high in the air over the canyon country where the Colorado and The Green River come together. On a clear day you can see along ways. Unfortunately the skies are not nearly as clear as the used to be. On my first trip in 1965 one could see sharply all the way to the horizon in all directions.

There are a number of entrances to the park and we explored the northernmost: Island in the Sky.. While the canyon views were interesting, I didn't feel that they have the ""pow"" effect that Arches provides and it is a long drive to get into the park and travel to the overlooks.(about 34 miles).

Canyonlands National Park,"I am not being melodramatic here. The story below is amazingly 100% true. I love this National Park. I have been coming here for 30 years. I write this because something has changed. I just need visitors to this park to be advised. Just “forewarned is forearmed”. Incredibly appropriate cliche as you will see. Like many National Parks today Canyonlands is hiring heavily armed ex-policeman as rangers. There are still some unarmed naturalists as rangers. These “real” rangers are always great and eager to help and inform visitors. Unfortunately, most rangers today couldn’t tell you the difference between a cactus and a pine tree. They just want to brandish their weapons and play “cops”. Since we camp a lot and visit a lot of National Parks we have seen this ugly trend almost everywhere, but never as bad as in Canyonlands this June. Twice, in 2 different districts in just 2 days we witnessed 2 teams of rangers, all 4 with weapons drawn for simple alleged traffic violations. One we were directly involved with. One we watched from close range. We were driving a pick up and pulling a small camper just outside Canyonlands Needles District when we were stopped for going 50 in a 35 mile an hour zone. I might have been going 50. I am not sure, but that isn’t the point here. I waited for the “ranger” to approach as he sat behind me with lights flashing. He didn’t. First his partner got out, gun drawn and rested it on the open car door window frame, pointed at my wife in the passenger seat. Then, the driving “ranger” got out, gun also drawn and approached my open window. He pointed his weapon at my face and demanded my drivers license, registration and insurance! I nervously asked “why the weaponry”. By this time his partner had crept silently up to the rear door on the passenger side, behind my wife, where she could not see, and had her weapon aimed squarely at the back of her head. I just couldn’t believe it. The officer responded “We are just looking out for one another”! I was both scared and livid. I gave this gun happy cretin my license and documents and watched as his partner slowly backed away to the same door position of the ranger vehicle never holstering her weapon. It stayed trained on my wife. In a few moments the armed mercenary on my side came back, gun holstered, and explained we were speeding. His partner still had her gun aimed at my wife. A little calmer now, I asked again “why the drawn weapons”? “Did your computer show any warrants or any issues with us”. “No” he said I asked “Has there been trouble in the Park”. again he replied “just looking out for one another”. HE DIDN’T EVEN WRITE US A TICKET. We received a written warning. His partner did not holster her weapon until the other was back in the drivers seat with his door closed. You have to be kidding me. My wife was petrified. We witnessed much the same a day later at Islands in the sky. We were parked very close in a turnout. I cannot say if a ticket was issued to this couple traveling with young children but the guns were out. And eventually they were let go. I mean anything can happen when loaded guns are drawn. Any accident would be tragic. How many hardened criminals pull trailers, travel with small children or even visit National Parks anyway? VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION that appears to be park policy and not isolated to a couple of “rogue” Guns & Ammo subscribing punk cops calling themselves rangers. Bottom line: Be careful and please be calm if pulled over or confronted by these dangerous, rangers in Canyonlands. Your life and the lives of your family could depend on it.

In Island in the Sky, we did only a few short hikes and focused more on stopping at the overlooks. The views were fantastic. In many ways, it was difficult to comprehend the view because it was so vast with so much depth to it. I think those who enjoy backcountry backpacking would have a great time here. We returned to Island in the Sky around 11pm. Canyonlands is a Dark Sky Park, and it is amazing. We got out of the car at Grand View Point and immediately could see the Milky Way; we didn't haven to wait for our eyes to adjust. Although we weren't there during a New Moon, we were there before moonrise. I cannot begin to describe the multitude of stars. Even though there was no light and no moon, the stars and the Milky Way gave off so much light that we could see each other about 10 feet away.

Our only negative observation is that the Park Service has done nothing over the past decades to improve parking for the number of visitors they have--and they advertise for and charge at the entry gate. Their excuse is they don't have funds for improvements; meanwhile tempers and safety concerns rise as overlooks and trailheads clog with cars, trucks, buses, campers, and people. We visited in May before Memorial Day, and although crowding of parking areas was obvious I cannot imagine how bad it will get during the summer season.","June 3, 2018",Superb,31,"Canton, Georgia",5

There was plenty of time to go there and dead horse point and still see most of the highlights and hike most of the shorter trails. The views of the canyons and the maze and needles district were breathtaking. We did the shorter easier hikes and still experienced the beauty of the area.

Canyonlands National Park,"We only spend a day in Canyonlands, and we used it to hike to Druid Arch. It was a fairly easy hike over all, but it was long and hot in the bottom of the canyon. There were a few harder spots where you had to scramble up steep rocks as part of the trail, and the last tenth or so of a mile was fairly vertical as we picked our way up a small boulder field. Definitely worth starting out carrying 4.5 liters of water for the 10 mile round trip hike. The arch was beautiful and the view of the canyons from the arch was gorgeous.

The landscape is full of character. We thoroughly enjoyed it. Once out of the park going north, we turned onto the Needles Overlook road. It’s 22 miles in, but well worth the drive!

Canyonlands National Park,"While Arches is a family favorite, there is something captivating about Canyonlands. It's much bigger and seems to have fewer people so it's easier to find parking at popular spots. We hiked into Upheaval Dome - that was probably our favorite because of the fascinating landscape. It's a bit of a hike up slick rock. Not really difficult but you do climb up and down in places. There are several places to just sit and ponder - the clouds moving across the landscape of red rock is stunning.We also went to Grand View Point Overlook - the view is wonderful and you can hike down off the rim if you want. Mesa Arch was a moderately easy walk and worth the journey. The views through the window of the arch are beautiful, especially as the sun is getting lower in the sky and the light bounces off the distant chimneys. We also walked out onto the ""Neck"" overlooking Shafer Trail (which looks cool to take sometime). It's a nice look at the valleys below.

Canyonlands National Park,"Since they are located so close together, I would imagine that most people coming to the Moab area visit both Canyonlands and Arches, and well they should because they are very different landscapes. For no particular reason, I chose to go to the Island of the Sky section of Canyonlands the 1st day of my trip, and Arches on the 2nd. I'm glad I did them in that order. I was impressed with the scenery of Canyonlands, but I think it would have been a let down if I had seen Arches first. Don't get me wrong, everyone should see both, but Canyonlands is not as jaw-dropping beautiful as Arches; it is more impressive for its scale than for the intricacies of its formations. You really do get a feeling like you're on top of the world and can see forever. In a one-day visit, you can stop at all the major overlooks and do some short hikes (Mesa Arch for sure, Upheaval Dome and/or Grand View Point as well) and still have time to visit Dead Horse State Park for sunset. I did not make it to The Needles Section of Canyonlands on this vacation but would like to see it on my next trip to this area. It might be possible to visit both sections in one day, but it would be a lot of driving and wouldn't leave time for any hiking (its about 110 miles between visitor centers, more to the scenic overlooks of each section).","May 10, 2018",Visit here before going to Arches.,11,"Orangevale, California",4

Definitely do the hike to the Mesa Arch which has an unbelievable sunrise view. Also, don't miss walking out to Shafer Canyon or Upheaval dome.

As with all National Parks, the Park newspaper is great for suggesting hikes which are categorised as Easy, Moderate or Strenuous. This is also available to view before your visit on the National Park website. We picked the easy routes because we were limited for time (we were staying in Moab and it’s a good hour’s drive between Moab and the Visitor Centre). The highlight for me was Mesa Arch. I’ve scored it a 3 simply because I think Zion, Canyonlands and Arches have more to offer the casual hiker.

Canyonlands National Park,"I have hiked in 40 of the 59 US National Parks and Canyonlands is one of my favorites. I first hiked here in 2011 and this was my third trip in 7 years.There are 2 main sections of Canyonlands, each with it's own visitor center and paved road access:Island In The Sky is the northern section and accessable to the west off of 191 north of Moab. Count on at least 1 hour one way from Moab to the visitor center. It is probably the most visited section of Canyonlands.The Needles is the SE section and is accessable well south of Moab off 191. Count on at least 2 hours one way from Moab.The 3rd section, The Maze, is not accessable by paved roads and has no visitor center. It is in the SW corner of the park and west of the confluence of the Green and Colorado Rivers. It is accessed by 4WD unpaved roads from the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area to the west.You can do a drive thru of the 2 paved sections of the park in a very long full day. But if you are a serious hiker you should give yourself at least a full day each to hike in Island In The Sky and The Needles, if not more, and get an early start due the drive distances from Moab.","April 23, 2018","If you visit Arches, plan on some time here as well",266,"Austin, Texas",5

Canyonlands National Park,"On our recent visit to Utah and the Moab area we were fortunate to visit Arches and Canyonlands National Parks. In our opinion, Arches is so unique that it almost should have a category all its own. But Canyonlands is well worth the visit for its spectacular views. Unfortunately, we could not visit all three areas of Canyonlands, but we did spend the morning visiting ""Island in the Sky"" which is about a 30 mile trip from Moab.The overlooks into the valleys created by the Green and Colorado Rivers are not to be missed, And Moab Arch is a fascinating creation of mother nature. The trip into the park is an adventure of its own since the road goes through open range and the cattle can come right up to the car.

Canyonlands National Park,"This park was a must since we were staying in Moab to visit Arches. We did 2 1/2 days in Arches (see my other review) and 2 days here. We alternated. We were myself, my husband, a 23,14,and 9 year old. We spent one day in Islands in the Sky which was about a 1/2 hour from Moab. We got there early and went right to Mesa Arch. We were told to be there for sunrise but missed it. We also went to White Rim Overlook, Upheaval Dome, Grand View Point and climbed Whale Rock. The hikes we did were easy. Whale Rock was little more moderate. The views at this park are unbelievable. The canyons seem to be endless. Another day we drove to Needles it took about 1 1/2 hours to get there. There we did Pothole Point, Cave Springs, and Slick Rock. You see the Needles in the distance and they look awesome but we thought we would be able to get right near them we were disappointed. We did more hiking in Islands in the Sky. We also drove on all roads in both parks that we were able to with our car. Think about getting a 4 wheel drive if you are going to these parks. You need to get to the parks early and bring lunch with you. My family liked Islands in the Sky better than Needles due to the hikes and closeness to Moab.

The entire road was amazing and once you got down off the cliff face not as scary. You definitely need an off road vehicle though and not too big as the hairpin turns were difficult even with our Tundra.

Canyonlands National Park,"This big park (about four and one-half times the acreage of Arches National Park) preserves a colorful landscape eroded into countless canyons, mesas and buttes by the Colorado and Green rivers and their tributaries. We visited both the Island in the Sky and the Needles areas of the park and enjoyed both. Keep in mind it’s about a two-hour drive between the two areas, and this time will increase if you stop to take photos of scenery along the way like we did. Island in the Sky is located on a high plateau, and the emphasis here is on overlooks. In this area, we enjoyed the Mesa Arch and Upheaval Dome trails. The Needles area takes its name from pinnacles of rock that jut out sharply from the ground, but if you stay fairly close to the park road, you’ll only see these formations from a distance. In the Needles area, we enjoyed the Cave Springs and Pothole Point trails. We visited the two park areas on different days with stops at other attractions, and an overnight in Monticello in between. Remember that both park areas are fairly remote and be sure to have plenty of gas, water, and food, because there’s no fuel or dining options in or around either part of the park. Neither side of the park was very busy when we visited in May, and we were glad we weren’t visiting in the heat of the summer.

Canyonlands National Park,"We visited Canyonlands National Park twice; spending a day at the Island in the Sky, the park’s most visited district, and another day at the Needles District, which is much less visited. Being very different and with access many miles a part, this review discusses the Island in the Sky while another review discusses our separate visit to the Needles.Being the closest district to Moab (about 32 mi/51.5k), the most developed and with spectacular canyon views that rival, and some equaling, the Grand Canyon without the crowds, the Island in the Sky is the most visited district in The Canyonlands. The district gets its name from being a huge, high mesa bounded by the Green River to the west and the Colorado River to the east that come to a confluence just beyond Grand View Point at southern end of the mesa. From the edges of this mesa there are many spectacular views of the canyon lands beyond.In a long, one day visit it is possible to see all of the highlights and hike a number of the better short trails including Grand View Point Outlook and trail (best in the morning or afternoon, trail up to 2mi/3.2k), Green River Overlook (morning or sunset), Shafer Canyon Overlook (afternoon), Mesa Arch (0.5mi/0.8k trail, sunrise or afternoon), Upheaval Dome (0.8mi/1.3k first overlook, 1.8mi/2.9k second overlook, morning) and Whale Rock (1.0mi/1.6k, morning). If you only have time or energy for one hike, be sure to do the easy loop trail to Mesa Arch which, perched on the edge of a cliff framing canyons, buttes and the mountains beyond, has become a symbol of the West.While visiting the Island in the Sky, we would also recommend a stop at the Dead Horse Point State Park which shares the same mesa in the northeastern corner and accessed by the same road as the Island in the Sky. It is possible to include to Dead Horse Point in your one day visit by visiting either in the morning on your way to the Island in the Sky or at the end of the day on your way out. The latter option is probably the best logistically due to the larger number of morning sites in the Island of the Sky while Dead Horse Point offers equally spectacular canyon views early or late. Entrance to Dead Horse Point is an additional $15 which seems high for such a small park but the views are excellent and my wife felt that access to flush toilets (not available in the Island in the Sky) after a long day was almost worth the price of admission alone.","December 1, 2017",Day 1 – Island in the Sky – Grand Vistas,3757,"Avon, Ohio",5

Canyonlands National Park,"My family and I visited Island in the Sky (the northern part of the park) at Canyonlands National Park in early October. To see the other two entrances, plan on driving several hours. The area is an hour drive from Moab but because it isn’t as close to Moab as Arches NP, it sees far less traffic. The park didn’t charge us an entry fee which is nice considering many national parks want to charge $70 per vehicle. The visitor center is smaller than in most other parks but has the same amenities. There are limited facilities available in the north part of the park and no lodging, fuel or restaurants near the park so come prepared. The park has both hiking trails as well as 4WD trails of various degrees of difficulty which should appeal to most people. There are some wonderful views of the canyons in the valley below which are must see. The northern entrance is near Dead Horse State Park which I would recommend visiting at the same time as Island in the Sky. Depending on the amount of hiking or 4WD you plan on doing, 1/2 day is adequate for Island in the Sky.

Canyonlands National Park,"Saw Canyonlands first in 2008 and wanted to spend more time there on this trip. Part of this natural wonder is known as Islands in The Sky and it feels just like that. The scenery defies description and in my opinion I prefer it to the Grand Canyon. Whilst the Grand Canyon is vast, wide and deep, the Canyonlands has a unique beauty and grandeur of its own. I liken it to a huge jigsaw with missing pieces. The colours and strata ttake your breath away. There is one road in and out taking you to many overlooks. All around are vast sandstone edifices which add grandeur to the deep canyons far below where you can get glimpses of both the Green river and the Colorado. It's a playground for intrepid cyclists and 4 wheeled vehicles who descend to the valley floor down winding vertiginous switchbacks. Do both the Islands in the Sky and The Needles to fully appreciate this marvellous landscape. ","October 16, 2017",Incredible scenery,8,"Dorset, United Kingdom",5

Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands doesn't inspire people the way places like Yosemite and Yellowstone do but that's only because of location and limited publicity. None the less, it is one of America's most stunningly beautiful places. I highly recommend going in early spring. There's less people traveling then and it's very comfortable compared to the summer months. Keep your eyes open on the road into the park entrance. There are old cliff dwellings secreted away that are easily overlooked. You might check with someone in Moab UT where to look or check it out after you go the the Visitor's Center to find out where to look. This place is majestic. The pure scale of the landscape and rock is mind boggling. There are tons of great trails and hikes to pursue. Take a good camera and expect too compose images you may not have ever tried to shoot before. To get the best sense of distance and depth of field, set your camera to a small f-stop like 18 or 22 and adjust your exposure accordingly depending of the time of day and available light. A good tripod really helps. It's tempting to zoom in on everything. That's OK but take some wide shots too. Plan on a picnic lunch and bring plenty of liquids.

Canyonlands National Park,"We (family of four with two teenage kids) had arrived in Moab and decided that we wanted to have a quick look in Canyonlands NP before sunset. The views already from the Highway 191 turn-off became spectacular pretty quickly. From there, it takes about 45 minutes or so to get to the islands in the sky entrance. It seems that no one mans the entrance after 5pm. However, as soon as we arrived we had to turn back because I realised that we had only about 40 miles of fuel left in the tank. I was convinced that we were going to run out of fuel on the way back. However, we managed to get to the gas station on highway 191 before we ran out (the station is just on the other side of the highway; though the fuel is expensive there). We then went to Dead Horse Point State Park (also spectacular) since we were now too late to see anything in Canyonlands.We went back to Canyonlands the next afternoon and even though we only had about 3 hours to visit, we were able to get to Schafer Point Overlook, Mesa Arch, Grand View Point Overlook and Green River Overlook, all before sunset at about 7:20pm. The views are simply spectacular.","September 29, 2017",Fabulous views but don't run out of fuel,90,"Brussels, Belgium",5
Canyonlands National Park,We only visited the island in the sky section of the park which is the most accessible. The park was quiet and we managed to see this section in 3 hours. There are some great views and a 2 or 3 mile easy hike at the end of the 'island'. It's definitely worth being in the park as the sun is going down and the colours of the canyon changes. There is a visitor centre as you enter the park with water and toilet facilities but after that you are on your own. So take plenty of water with you.

Canyonlands National Park,"This park is divided into two very different sections. The North section is the Island in the Sky section and can be seen from a car. This section has fantastic overlooks, easily assailable from a car with a short easy hike. But the real gem is the southern section called the Needles. It's a long drive to this section from Moab (70+ miles) but well worth the trip if you are a hiker. This section leads you down into the canyons. There are numerous trails here. All are full day or multi day hikes. These trails are rated strenuous but we would rate them as moderate with some short strenuous sections. Warning, these trails are for experienced hikers only, but once you get into the canyons they are worth the effort. You will walk along dry washes between narrow canyon walls, along trails that are on ledges on the side of the cliff, and climb over slickrock to great vistas. Due to the heat the best time to see this park is in the spring or fall. Summers are brutal here.","September 28, 2017",Majestic vistas and great canyon hiking.,14,"Katy, Texas",5

Canyonlands National Park,"We took the road out to the Island in the Sky portion of the park and its name is pretty much right on. The road out is pretty spectacular in its own right, but once you get into the park itself it just gets better and better. Be sure to stop at the overlooks and get out and wander around. There are places where you cannot see the bottom on three sides. Unlike the eastern parks, you find very few guardrails and fences in the western parks, so be careful as you wander around. There are spots where parking can be tricky as there are loads of people in this section of the park, but just be patient and one will open up shortly.Make sure you get all the way to the end of the road, the overlook is well worth the trip.

Canyonlands National Park,"At first we weren't sure about this park however the longer we were here the more we liked it. We had a ranger suggest an itinerary for our two days which included a number of hikes. The park was busy when we visited and we found although less busy than Arches NP there are fewer parking places so you have a hard time sometimes getting parking places near the trailheads especially at the more popular trails. We liked Canyonlands better than the Grand Canyon but the thing you need to remember is that you have to hike quite a ways (1-2 miles on rocky trails) before you reach the switchbacks that lead to the canyon floor. We also found the switchbacks hard to navigate and usually turned back at the cliff edge at the switchbacks. We hiked Mesa Arch, Upheaval Dome (sedond overlook), Grandview Point, and Wilhite Trail that was recommended by a ranger. There are other hikes we didn't get to do that we are hoping we can come back to one day.","September 24, 2017",Great National Park,126,"Shawnee, Kansas",5

Canyonlands National Park,"Don't miss this NP if you're in the area! It has beautiful canyons, buttes, hoodoos, and an arch. Maybe not as impressive as the Grand Canyon or Arches, but the expansive valley with multiple viewpoints is pretty darned stunning. Note there are two entrances. This review is for ""Island in the Sky"". The other entrance is 100 miles away - Needles. BE PREPARED - there are no restaurants in the park, so bring some food. You'll probably spend at least 3 hours here, and the nearest town is at least 30 minutes away. There are no running-water toilets in the park, but the chemical toilets are well maintained. Wear shoes that grip the rock surfaces well, but also watch out - the fine sand covering these rocks can be really slippery. There are very few guard fences - you can walk right up to the edge. At Shafer's Trail overlook, there is a beautiful spot for photographers, but it's a tad ""hairy"" getting to it. Don't try it if you fear heights or have vertigo. I'm 66 YO and didn't have any problems. Walk the half mile to Mesa Arch - again, the views are stunning!

Canyonlands National Park,"The northern entrance of the park leads to a series of mesas overlooking the Green and Colorado Rivers -- a very Grand Canyon-like feeling without the crowds, and offering similar opportunities to hike down if one wished. The southern entrance (2.5 hour drive from the northern entrance; we did it on a different day) offers even more sweeping views. The canyons are double-level; you are on top of one canyon, but the flat area below you is split by yet another canyon. The southern entrance is like Grand Canyon's north side -- much more remote, less-attended, and a different feel, including a whole field of ""needles"" (tall spires next to each other carved by wind and rain). Along with viewing from the top, both entrances offer various hikes down into the canyon -- we did an easy hike along the top (early in the morning, as afternoon temperatures reach over 100 that Labor Day weekend), but did not feel up to hiking down and back up.","September 17, 2017","Great Views; the ""northern grand canyon of the Colorado""",15,"Austin, Texas",5

You cannot access the other 2 sections of the park from this road. Stop at the Visitor's Center for a little information, a short film presentation, water, and clean flush toilets. Right across the road is a gorgeous view of Schafer canyon. From the viewpoint, you can see the road where people with 4 wheel drive vehicles and lots of courage can drive on a narrow gravel road to the bottom and back up. Not for this plains girl! There is a hike from there which we followed for a ways with some breathtaking views. Easy pull offs to Green River Overlook, and at the end of the road, Grand View Overlook. We did short hikes to Mesa Arch and the Upheaval Dome for more great views.

It is a little more remote and not as developed in terms of trails and services. It is also split into 3 distinct parts, separated from each other by huge canyons.However, for those of you who do visit, you will be suitably impressed by the amazing scenery. There are spectacular views of deep canyons and rugged terrain. We visited the Island in the Sky section -- a 6,000 feet high flat-topped mesa surrounded on 3 sides by canyons that drop precipitously. It seems as though you can see forever in the distance.We did some excellent hikes, like the ones to Mesa Arch and Murphy's Point. But the scenic drive also takes you to a number of scenic look-offs close to the road. As the park is so high, the altitude lowers the temperature, so you will not roast like you can at the Arches national park.If you plan to visit more than three national parks over the next year, it is worth getting the annual park pass for $80.

This would be a great place for a jeep or atv adventure. Only disappointment was Mesa Arch, clearly the arch has turned into a campground of some sort. We left Moab way early to catch the sunrise and we're surprised to find overnighters in sleeping bags all around the arch, swarms of knats and bitting flys from the unsanitary conditions.

This summer (2017) we only made it to the Island in the Sky area and our time was limited, since we spent more time than we'd planning in Arches NP. Again, even with limited time, it was amazing.

There are these large craters with narrow crevices with water flowing thru it and mountains which appear to be vertically chopped with sharp knives. Wonder how these were formed in the first place. There is an entrance fee for the park and thereafter you can go to the various spots identified and named.

While there were neat views if you don't hike down to the major sights you don't get to see everything. Due to physical issues that prevented us from hiking the more strenuous trails we missed out on the best views. The park does not kick you out at a certain time so you can spend as long as you want inside the park. They also have water at the visitor center to re-fill your water bottles. The best part for Canyonlands was The Needles Section! It is 40 miles south of Moab so you can't get to The Needles Section via the Island In the Sky.

Canyonlands National Park,"I wasn't sure what to expect when we drove into the park. I wasn't real happy about having to pay a large fee to get in, but I guess that is part of it.The drive into the visitor center was kinda crazy, they were doing road construction and you had to ""follow the leader"" through the one lane roads. The one lane went on forever, so we had to wait for a while to get through. Fortunately they had stopped for the day when we were coming back out to the highway.I was somewhat impressed with the views from the visitor center. The staff told us which areas you could view from the car and which one required you to hike into. We drove through and seen some really nice views and got some cool pics. Our last part of the drive was at the ""Grand View Point"". Lets just say WOW! We had visited the South Rim of the Grand Canyon several years ago, and this was a real close run for the money for a spectacular view! We visited the North Rim after leaving here, and I have to say that this beat the North Rim!!

Canyonlands National Park,"We visited Canyonlands National Park twice; spending a day at the Island in the Sky, the park’s most visited district, and another day at the Needles District, which is much less visited. Being very different and with access many miles a part, this review discusses the Needles while another review discusses our separate visit to the Island in the Sky.Considered by many to be the most beautiful district of Canyonlands National Park with its maze of canyons and colorful banded rock formations of all sorts, including the many clustered rock spires known as The Needles for which the district is named after. This district is much less visited than the Island in the Sky since it less accessible due to its distance from Moab (74mi/119k/1.5hr) or Monticello (49mi/79k/1hr) and its lower level of development.The lower level of development of The Needles district means that most of it its key features can only be reached following a long, strenuous hike or difficult, technical 4x4 drive. Of course this makes the district a magnet for an outdoor enthusiasts who will want to camp overnight to get the most out of their visit to The Needles. However, this makes it more difficult for the more casual visitor, commonly staying in Moab, such as ourselves, to experience the district but we were able to put together a worthwhile daytrip to The Needles that gave us a good taste for the district.We departed Moab early in the morning, taking Hwy 191 to Hwy 211 to The Needles visitor center in order to check-in and get advice from the rangers, bypassing Wilson Arch and Newspaper Rock until our return trip as they are both backlit in the morning and knowing that the trails in The Needles, and the views from them, are best in the morning. We hiked all four of the short, self-guided trails, each offering something different, starting with the closest to the visitor center and ending with the furthest; in order, Roadside Ruin (0.3mi/0.5k), Cave Spring (0.6mi/1.0k), Pothole Point (0.6mile/1.0k) and Slickrock (2.4mi/3.9k). On the way from the Cave Spring trail to the Pothole Point trailhead, at a ranger’s suggestion, we detoured to the outlook about 1 mike (1.6k) down the road to Elephant Hill which provides the best view of The Needles without a long hike or 4x4 drive. We finished with lunch at a picnic area along the main park road a short distance east of Pothole Point.If you do not have the time or the energy to do all four of the short hikes, I would recommend hiking the Cave Spring and Pothole Point trails as they provide the greatest variety of features and best views for the effort. On the way back to Moab, we stopped at Newspaper Rock on Hwy 211 where there are an enormous number petroglyphs inscribed on the face of a cliff, and Wilson Arch, which is a massive arch perched high alongside Hwy 191.","August 30, 2017",Day 2 – Needles District – Uncrowded Beauty,3757,"Avon, Ohio",4

The Grand View Point Overlook is definitely worth investing the hour and a half that it takes to make the mile hike along the cliff rim to a panoramic view of the canyons below. Like its sister Arches Park, services are sparse. There are adequate no-running water bathrooms, but that's about it. Bring your own water and food and shade. There are some nice picnic areas with great views and shaded tables, but they fill up fast. When we visited in late August 2017, the construction on Highway 313 leading into the park casued a 20 minute delay. Definitely ask the locals to give you the latest on that issue.

There is also a road .. well it's sort of a road (more like a sandy trail) specifically for 4 wheel vehicles that brings you down to a river overlook which is supposed to be beautiful .. that we took in my F150 .. well ..

Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands is essentially three parks in one -- (1) a northern ""Island in the Sky"" high mesa offering spectacular views, very drivable, short hikes to overlooks, great for the less strenuously-inclined; (2) a southern ""Needles"" section offering a mixture of short and strenuous hikes through extraordinary fins and other structures; and, (3) the western ""Maze"" section for serious hikers and backpackers only. The Chesler Park Overlook in Needles is a moderately taxing 6 mile hike which we loved, but which contains lots of vertical and is really tough on a hot day. Very limited facilities, though the ""Needles Outpost"" just outside the park is a hoot and may offer the best milkshakes after a 100 degree hike on the planet.

The desert landscape is breathtaking.The Colorado River winds through Canyonlands and makes for some very picturesque views. Island in the Sky is a flat topped Mesa with spectacular views. You can drive to Canyonlands from Moab in about 30 mins. There are lots of places to visit, hike and camp in Canyonlands. The towering rock pinnacles called Needles are spectacular as are the Maze and the Native American rock paintings in Horseshoe Canyon. We camped here in Winter so plenty of warm weather gear was required. Moab is a great base, close to Arches National Park as well. There is one RV Park open in Winter so planning ahead if you are going in Winter is recommended.","August 19, 2017",Beautahful!,6,"Sydney, Australia",5

Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands is very large, and The Needles district is over an hour drive from Moab. We were coming to Moab from the South (Durango) so we stopped at The Needles on our drive to Moab. We were very glad we did. The Needles district is extraordinary, and a very different experience from that of Island in the Sky in the North. It should not be missed.As for Island in the Sky, we tackled this two ways. First, we took an early morning 4x4 tour from Adrift Adventures that took us into the park along Potash Road, then climbed up to the top of the mesa along the Shafer Trail. This was a very ""up close and personal"" way to experience this part of the park. In the afternoon, we drove ourselves along the top of the mesa to look out over the canyons. This was spectacular is a very grand but impersonal way.Don't drive into the park without at least 3/4 tank of gas, as there is no gas to be had in the park.

Canyonlands National Park,"OK - Canyonlands NP is divided into 4 districts. The most proximate district is Island in the Sky, which I visited. It's a fantastic park. Roads are great, but there are almost no services (a small trinket & trash shop with a single water fountain), so be prepared and bring plenty to drink. There are attractions all along the main road - several arches and other sites, plus beautiful overlooks. Keep in mind that the sun is HOT and light is HARSH; if you're taking photos, underexpose by at least 1/3 of a stop. Wear a hat and apply sunscreen liberally.This place comes alive at night, literally. It's one of the darkest parks in the NP System. Head to the one of the view points an hour or so before sunset. If you don't have kids, set up on the rocks (the rocks are highly exposed, so keep young kids away), and wait. The sun will set, the colors come alive, and finally a zillion stars will come out. Sunset here was one of the highlights of my trip!Note that camping is really difficult. It's first-come, first-serve, and any open site is generally claimed by 10 or 11 am. BLM campgrounds like Horsethief, which is just outside the NP, are a great backup but don't offer much protection from the sun.","August 9, 2017",Island in the Sky District,20,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands National Park (CNP) is an easy 35 minute drive from Moab to the ""Island In The Sky"" entrance of the park. This is IMPORTANT TO NOTE; there are 2 separate entrances to CNP leading to 2 closed loop road networks in the park. The lack of a connecting road between these 2 networks pretty much mandates that a thorough tour of CNP will require at least 2 DAYS. Once one sees this place it is easy to understand why a connector road was not built. Kudos to the NPS for keeping to their mission of preserving this place as it is meant to be...wilderness.I will confine my review of CNP to the northern section of the park as we did not have time to enter ""The Needles"" section of the CNP. Once again a stop at the Visitors Center to gather materials and get a feel for our day. BTW it was a lovely day, mid to upper 70's and mostly sunny. We hit every Overlook along the road along with some exploring. I was grateful for my hiking boots. Every stop well worth the time and effort. Every stop was also well attended making parking a PITA at times. I assume this only becomes more acute as the season progresses.Good view of a brown river at the Green River Overlook.The highlight of the day was our conquest of ""Whale Rock"".

That drive in itself is a treat with a stop or two for fantastic views! There is a wonderful visitors center with bathrooms, gifts, informative rangers, and views. Like the other parks, the road is paved with several stops along the way with stunning views. I would probably be a nervous wreck if I had small children with me. (Maybe even use a leash which I always hated seeing on a kid) Several stops do not have railings and there are cliffs way up high! take your water and camera if you leave your car. The road visible down in the canyon is very interesting for both the history as well as just seeing what the old timers had to use for transportation...it was closed during our visit but I think it might be accessible at times with the appropriate vehicle??

Canyonlands National Park,"What an astonishing place! Entered via the Island in the Sky Visitor Centre gate and headed for Mesa arch. It was well after sunrise but still the reflected light of the landscape below reflected onto the underside of the arch giving it that famous glow. It is beautiful, but what takes it to another level is the sheer awesomeness of the landscape beyond which is framed within the arch. Pictures don't do it justice.Walks at Green River overlook, Grand View Point overlook and the rather weird Upheaval Dome all offered something different although still spectacular. From the Island in the Sky, canyons carved by the Green and Colorado rivers are laid out in front of you for as far as the eye can see with a vast array of associated geological features. Snow-capped mountains complete the vista. We thought the Grand Canyon was awesome but the views there are dull in comparison to those of Canyonlands. The Island in the Sky may be the jewel in the crown of Canyonlands but this is a vast park which has so much more to see and explore.

This park is great for just auto-touring if you don't care to see the canyons in detail or for intense, often difficult hiking if you are up to it. We visited during early July when temperatures were were over 100 degrees. We took only short, easy hikes because of the heat and insufficient time to take longer trails. The scenery is awesome.

The Needles is 74 miles south of Moab. The Maze looks like it is much further away. It requires high clearance 4WD vehicles. We did not do that. Island in the Sky offered long relatively easy hikes overlooking canyons way below. It was kind of scary to get close to the edge. But you do not have to do that. I wanted to continue much further down the trail but we wanted the time to see the Needles. It was a long drive to the Needles which offered different rock formations being buttes.

With our kids being very interested in geology and space, Upheaval Dome is quite incomprehensible.

The Needles is a bit more isolated and less crowded. Here we see things from below! You have to hike to appreciate the places.3. The Maze which can only be reached in 4x4 and with night in the nature. It is one of the most isolated places in the USA!To rally the different parts by road, you have to do several dozen miles!

Canyonlands National Park,"On day 2 of our visit to Moab we went to the Needles area ( southern part of Canyonlands park). It's a bit long drive ( 1.5 hours one way) from Moab, but it's absolutely worth the drive.The road itself is quite scenic, especially after you turn from HWY191 to HWY211. Most of the trails that offer really great views and close experience of the canyon walls are quite challenging, with lots of ups and downs and the length starting from 7 miles, but the views and the scent of pine trees in hot sun are really worth the effort.The park is open 24 hours, at least in the summer time, so plan to start early, 6-7 am, we were too lazy and hit the trail at 10 am, it was already a bit too warm, though in many places on the trail there was nice breeze. If you decide to take one of the longer trails, make sure to have 4+ liters of water with you PER PERSON. It seems to be a lot, especially in the beginning, but you'll appreciate this burden further down the trail. If you can, get 0.5-1 L of cold water in insulated bottles, makes miracles on your way back, and get some salty snacks.Unlike Arches national park or the vista point in the northern part of Canyonlands, which get overcrowded, the Needles area provides completely different experience, it's gonna be you and the nature most of the time, seeing occasional hikers on your way is actually a good sign that you did not lose the trail.If you are visiting Moab for more than 2 days, I'd strongly recommend to take this trip.","June 28, 2017",Needles district- hidden gem,6,Novato,5

We chose to visit the side of the park with the Needles on our first day. Be aware that this is a loooong drive outside of Moab, but it also made it less crowded ... I mean there were literally only a handful of other people there with long stretches of running into no one else. It actually takes quite a lot of driving to even get to the actual park once you turn off the highway - and be prepared to turn rather suddenly as there is only one unassuming sign that suddenly pops up giving notice of the Canyonlands turnoff. Newspaper Rock petroglyph is an interesting stop. Honestly, the petroglyphs look rather modern and suspiciously well maintained. But hey, its a good stop point after that looooong drive & it has restrooms. (Its quite a bit further before you reach the park so stop while you can) Has a very small visitors center with very small amount of parking. You can refill your water bottles. Seems to have wifi access. There's a cute little picnic area down the road from the visitors center. Beautiful vistas as the light was hitting the canyon walls.

To think that a few brave soles came to these areas in search of gold, uranium, coal is awe inspiring. To also see the marks on the earth that these endeavors left is also touching. You must see Mesa Arch, especially at sunrise. Someday I'd like to return and see the impact crater and possible drive the 100 mile road across the basin (no gas,no restrooms).

Canyonlands National Park,"This review only refers to the southern section of Canyonlands and then only from a driving point of view. The landscape of Canyonlands is breathtakingly spectacular and I'm sure those who hike this vast desert wilderness will find it excellent but from a driving point of view it is not up there with Arches, Bryce Canyon or Capitol Reef.There are two reasons for this. Firstly, it is difficult to understand quite how the park's boundaries have been defined. The totally free drive from Newspaper Rock - a must see for the petroglyphs - to the Visitor Centre is actually as good as anything within the park itself. Secondly...once you make it to the entrance it is only possible to drive for six and a half miles without having to rely on shoe leather or a 4x4. Wonderful and superbly spectacular place to be but not as suited to car access as other NP's we have been to and for those who only drive...the journey to the Visitor Centre may be enough.","June 14, 2017",One for the hikers perhaps,223,"Ashbourne, United Kingdom",4

Canyonlands National Park,"This park has nearly 338,000 acres and there are different points of entry that will let you see only parts of this huge site. Many opt to rent an SUV and I can see the value if you want to spend days there. That's not necessary. We drove into the park via the Island in the Sky entrance near Moab - this entrance is quite popular because it's close to Arches and Moab. Here are some tips: 1. If you are doing the Mighty Five Trip on your own, you're not a long hiker and you want to access the highlights by car (not a Jeep or SUV), you can do Capitol Reef (early am), Canyonlands (midday) and Arches (afternoon). We slept near CR and stayed the night in Moab after seeing Canyonlands and Arches nearby. As a friend said, after a couple of days looking at orange rocks you might feel satisfied enough to move on. 2. Moab is the best place to stay with lots of lodging and restaurant choices. Torrey is close to CR and there are not many choices. 3. Avoid holidays and summers in these parks. The people, cars, RVs and buses will overwhelm you. We did a fast tour to avoid the crowds we found the week BEFORE Memorial Day. 4. Bring food and water with you into this park - there is little there. 5. Stop at the visitor center - their illustrated map of highlights on an easel at the door will allow you to pick the things to see that interest you and save you valuable time. Whey don't all parks do this? Take a picture with your smartphone and you're off! 6. The short hikes from the parking areas will allow you to see the highlights without much difficulty. The view across the street from the visitor center is quite nice. 7. As beautiful as this park is, save your time for Arches nearby because it's amazing. I'd rank Canyonlands #4 of the Mighty Five.","June 12, 2017",Canyonlands Tips!,52,United States,3

It seemed to be much of the same and I actually stopped hiking and read a book while husband did more of the rim hike. Husband and friend then did the Neck Spring Loop hike which they said was ""OK"".

Unfortunately, we did not do a lot of hiking since this was the last park (we'd visited the other 4 Utah National Parks in the past 2 weeks) and our kiddos were worn out.

Canyonlands National Park,"We really enjoyed this park, probably better than Arches. It's not as congested as Arches, and Island in the Sky offers multiple overlook viewing opportunities adjacent to the roadway. Nevertheless, arrive early, as this is a forty minute drive from Moab, and the park does get crowded later in the day, and bring water. Our last stop at Upheaval Dome required patience looking for parking. Your first stop needs to be the Visitor Center where you can get your necessary map and use the rest rooms. After viewing Shafer Canyon from the first overlook, travel 6 miles to Mesa Arch. Mesa Arch is one of the highlights of your trip as it's the most picturesque spot and a truly amazing natural wonder - it's a relatively easy 1/2 mile flat round trip walk. After Mesa, the road splits - to the left is 6 miles, and to the right is 5 miles; do both! We viewed Buck Canyon, Grandview Point, and Green River Overlooks on our trip to the left then we reversed eleven miles towards Upheaval Dome. This was the only strenuous walk, as it was an upward tiered walk on uneven terrain for about a round trip of a mile to see the first overlook position. As upper sixty seniors, my wife stayed behind and I took the challenge - water was necessary as well as a few stopping points. Overall it was worth the hike, and of course the return downward trip was a lot easier. You'll see a lot of wonderful ""Canyonlands"" at this park, as well as an ""Arch"", and it has reminded travelers of a serious canyon in the adjacent state.","June 8, 2017",We loved the many viewing vistas this park has to offer!,240,"Pittsgrove, New Jersey",5

Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands National Park is one of the famed Mighty Five in southern Utah that includes nearby Arches, Capital Reef, Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks. These are an outstanding collection of protected areas to be enjoyed by visitors from around the world. The National Park has two major areas including the Island in the Sky section, which is 30 miles southwest of Moab as well as the Needles district, accessed from east when driving south of Moab. Because of its proximity to the city and Arches National Park, the Island in the Sky section of Canyonlands is a very popular destination for day and multiple day visits. Entering the Island in the Sky section of the NP. you first encounter a useful Visitor Centre. Opening hours vary based on the season but were 9am to 4pm during our early April visit. Note that there is a good NPS website for Canyonlands, including a information related to Visitor Centre services. It is advisable to research and review park details there while scheduling future visits. As for Island in the Sky, it is delightfully packed with dramatic scenery and impressive landscapes. After visiting the Visitor Centre, you begin a rewarding Scenic Drive south towards the Grandview Point Overlook. At the end of this drive you will enjoy what is perhaps one of the finest desert viewpoints you will ever see, filled with canyons, riverbeds, buttes and other harsh land formations which stretch into the distance. In route, you will have opportunity to enjoy a handful of impressive stops. These include the Shafor Road Overlook, where you can see a remarkable trail road scaling the side of the cliffs up to Canyonlands. A few miles down the road, there is a short stop and hike to see Mesa Arch. Just south of Mesa Arch, you turn northwest and make way to Upheaval Dome where great short hikes and impressive viewpoints await. The landscape here is rugged, dramatic and very photogenic. Based on our experience, it seems possible to see a good number of highlight spots in 2/3 to 3/4 of a day at Island in the Sky. However, if you want to explore more leisurely or take in some of the longer and more requiring hikes, you will want to allocate another day or two for a more in-depth visits.Note: Dead Horse Point is within range and can be combined with a visit to the Island in the Sky of Canyonlands. Combined this makes for a nice day trip from Moab.  Note: Entry to Canyonlands National Park is $25 per vehicle for a period of 7 days. However there is a combo - Southeast Utah Park Annual Pass for $50 that provides additional access to Arches National Park as well as Hovenweep and Natural Bridges National Monuments. With this pass, you can save a bit of money if you are intending to visit each of these places.Good luck to all and hope you enjoy your time spent at Island in the Sky!","June 7, 2017",One of the Mighty Five national parks in southern Utah,18551,"Hong Kong, China",5

We spent 6 hours today and saw Mesa Arch and did 4 ""easy"" hikes and the ""moderate"" Upheaval Dome hike for about 10.5 miles overall. Very interesting scenery. The Mesa Arch was crowded, but the rest of the trails were not. The temperature was 92 by 3 PM so we wish we would have started earlier and would have worn more sunscreen.

Kind of the same view but from an other angle. The last walk we made was to the Upheavel Dome, a short walk about half a mile. Beatiful crater with greenish sand in it. In the park there are far more walks and hikes to do, but not for us with 100 degrees F. (37.5 C) A tip; if you're planning more than, lets say, 3 or 4 visits to a NP, buy a annual card for 80 USD.

The park was very busy so parking at the various points took a little time.

The sights were much better at Island in the Sky.Both areas had very long drives from the main road, at least 20-34 miles one way. They are huge areas but the roads were newly paved so the drive is easy. Island in the Sky has many more impressive rock formations and canyons to view while driving, stopping and taking a few short hikes. Mesa Arch was worth the hike. Also notable for Islands in the Sky is the close proximity to Dead Horse Point State Park. We ended up doing both Dead Horse and Islands between 10-3pm on a Saturday. It was a good pace.

Unless one wants to hike or off-road vehicle (ORV) in a National Park, there isn't much else worth doing in The Needles portion of Canyonlands National Park. Newspaper Rock is on BLM land and is quite interesting. The best part of our experience inside the park was the end of the scenic drive. There is parking and it makes a very nice place to take photos and picnic. The Needles Overlook which is part of the newly formed Bear Ears National Monument and not part of Canyonlands National Park IS worth the drive out to the overlook.

Since the park is so large, I only had time to visit the Islands in the Sky section of it. Let me tell you that name is fitting. As you drive up into the park and you walk arcoss the road from the visitor's center you understand how that section of the park got its name! You look out into the canyon before you and realize what a special place this park is! Each overlook is just as amazing as the last and really makes you feel small but at the same time you truly appreciate the grandeur of the land that is in front of you. Take your time at each overlook and soak in the space that seems to stretch forever in front of you.

We had to fight for parking and the various walks were very busy with LOUD gabbing visitors - really I am not interested in overhearing your inane conversation!! The view from the point from Needles in the Sky was awesome when you could push through the tour bus loads of Chinese tourists and added to our understanding of the amazing geology of the area as you could look down on the White Rim, see the Potash works, and look across to Needles in the Sky part of the park - the true gem.The next day we took the 1.5 hour drive down to the Needles in the Sky area and were rewarded by amazing vistas, a great diversity of short hikes, and a more intimate experience as you were down in the rocks not just looking across at them from on high. We found an great picnic spot perched on a rock that we had all to ourselves and could hear the wind whistling up the canyon.

The geology and topography is reminiscent of The Grand Canyon, but slightly different in that the canyonlands seem to just extend off in all directions...as far as the eye can see...not like the Grand Canyon which is this huge, deep crevice into the earth. The scenic photo stops to recommend would be Grand View Point Overlook, and Green River Point Overlook, which are both located in the northern third of the park, which is named Island In The Sky. The middle third of the park, The Maze, is more geared to off road and strenuous hiking. The southern third of the park, The Needles, is another easily accessible area that is almost another days worth of driving to and from. I found that the best bang for the buck was limiting my visit to the northern third, Island in the Sky, it's the most popular, hence more people, but is also the easiest to get to and to get from...and is basically just across the road from Arches National Park.

Continue straight, however, and you will eventually come to the Island in the Sky Visitors Center. Get your bearings there and then get back out on the road to take in extraordinary vistas. We were here in late spring, so the snow-covered LaSalle Mountains off to the southeast provided a nice contrasting backdrop for the red rock gorges immediately in front of us. The road to Grand View Point is in open range, so be on the lookout for cows wandering across the road. Also, check out the Orange Cliffs Overlook, just before the Grand View Points; as well as the Buck Canyon Overlook, The Shafer Canyons Overlook and others along the way. There is also, on the right hand (north) side, a side trip to Upheaval Dome; an impact crater from a meteor strike long ago. We took half a day for this and could have taken longer. Glad we now have digital cameras, because I took dozens and dozens of pictures. For the more adventuresome, there are trails to hike and bike.","May 26, 2017",Impossible to not be amazed and amazed again,205,"Marlborough, Massachusetts",5

The second most visited portion is called ""The Needles"" and I loved this portion the most because you are low, and looking up at all the wonderful scenery--and the hiking was fabulous. The third portion, visited the least and which I believe you can only get to via 4-wheel high axle (Jeep) vehicle or hiking is called ""The Maze."" Haven't been there.

If you need a flushing toilet to enjoy nature, clearly you and I have different ideas of what it's like to truly enjoy nature. We did a 4-day (self-guided) backpacking adventure in Island of the Sky and loved it. It seemed like we had the park to ourselves because on Wilhite and the White Rim Road, we saw zero other backpackers, one tour group of cyclists, and one vehicle. Pros: - crowd-free - stunning scenery- ""natural"" (i.e., pit toilets, you pack in your own water, etc.) - diverse (towers, rivers (Green and Colorado), alcoves, and more)- plenty of wildlife (lizards, deer, snakes, birds--all of which we saw)Cons: - None!

We enjoyed the Mesa Arch view, but for the most part, this park does nothing to keep people engaged. The overlooks are OK, but all the text describing them seems to just be proud of that little to none of this land has been developed. We saw just one substantial trail and a total of three significant overlooks. But Arches and Dead Horse Point State Park are both significantly better designed than this one. Both Arches and Dead Horse even have real flushing toilets and Canyonlands, just down the road a few miles, has nothing but pit toilets. We won't be back.

The scenery in the Island district is unique and striking, with views of the Green River Canyon.The relative absence of tour buses makes Canyonlands more appealing because there is more parking and smaller crowds at the main attractions. Also, seeing the best views requires some walking, anything from a couple hundred yards to a couple of miles.

Canyonlands National Park,Both the accessible areas of Canyonlands require a fairly long drive to get to the visitor centers. The South end is approximately 34 miles from the highway but the drive into the park is almost as spectacular as the park itself. Fairly short hikes take you to amazing scenic viewpoints. Be sure to take the one lane road to Elephant Hill and you may see jeeps coming down the steep slope which will take your breath away. The North entrance requires a 22 mile drive to get to the visitor center at Island in the Sky where you can see for miles and miles. It's the more popular part of the park and more crowded. Really worth the trip. Be sure to take the hike to Mesa Arch which is spectacular.

Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands National Park is an easy addition when you are in the area to see Arches. The park has three distinct areas, each accessible via different directions and roads. Don't plan to do all three in one day! If you are near Moab, drive just about half an hour to the west and you will be in the Islands in the Sky portion of the park. Enjoy the vistas on that drive even before you reach the park. The visitor center is quite primitive compared to the one in Arches and parking is at a premium. The views along the main road are reminiscent of the Grand Canyon, We drove to the Grand View overlook and hiked to the end of the trail, about 45 minutes at a slow pace. The trail is well-groomed, but not paved, and there are plenty of well-maintained steps to negotiate the steeper areas. Driving back we stopped at numerous overlooks and short trails to enjoy this spectacular park.

Canyonlands requires a bit of a drive off the main highway (US191). The park has lots of grassland areas (watch out for cows!), and glimpses along the way of giant canyons. There are a number of vista points for the canyons (North and South), as well as hikes along the canyon rim. There is some sort of access for bikes and ATVs in the canyons, but we did not get any details about this option.

Don not think they are the same and only do one.If you are a photographer you will have great opportunities. Best times are in the morning and late afternoon.

Although that meant a longer drive out of Moab to get there--it was well worth the effort. Once on the state road to the park, the views were spectacular so even the drive time was well spent. Once in the Needles district, we quickly routed to the trail head. The hiking was moderately challenging with short ascents and descents across slickrock and through grass lands. Several stretches required following cairns but nothing too difficult with regards to navigation. Trailhead/parking area was pretty full but there were a variety of trails so on many stretches, we had it all to ourselves.

It's quite a drive from the highway and we weren't sure on where to find the visitor centre - especially as tourists from Europe without mobile internet. Once we did find the visitors centre 7pm), it was closed so it's an honesty box for the entry(I think the centre closes at 6) which has a map box next to it. We headed straight to Schafer canyon- you walk from the road and you don't see the vista till you reach the guard rail. And it just opens out in front of you - mind blowing. Then Mesa arch, it was a very easy 5 minute walk from the carpark and there wasn't many people at 7:30pm. Not so good for a sunset but still interesting.

It is necessary to backtrack a little, but they are both in the same area. Recreation is multi-layered in this park, and spread out enough that one can get space to oneself, not be part of the masses. While we stopped at various lookouts with the car on mesa top roads, we also took a nearly 4 mile round trip practically level hike on a ""primitive"" trail (Murphy Point) for a spectacular view of the Green River. While the mesa top is one of mainly road viewing, I had the feeling that lots of really fun stuff was going on in the gorgeous canyons below, such as biking and rafting. There are also a few hikes from mesa top to the valley floor which are not possible for us any more. It seems that carrying enough water to stay hydrated, whatever one's preference, is a challenge, but worth the effort.

Canyonlands National Park,"This large park actually has 3 sections, only 2 of which are accessible by car. Do take the time to visit both The Needles Section in the south off Hwy. 191 near Monticello, UT and Island In The Sky off Hwy. 313 NW of Moab. The Maze is backcounty only. Caution: the roads into Canyonlands are paved but have a 50 mph speed limit. Please heed it. You will be driving across open range (there are no fences, so the grazing cattle are right up to or on the road), and there are potholes. Island In The Sky is just that: an ecosystem atop a large mesa. There is a 34 mi. RT scenic Mesa Loop, and it is about 32 mi. one way from Moab to get to the park. Be sure you have plenty of gas, as there are no services in or near the park. At Island In The Sky, you experience a number of scenic overlooks and vistas looking down on the Green River Valley Below. This is a desert environment with little water. Even the visitor's center has only pit toilets. Bring plenty of water to drink. If you have limited mobility, there are 3 vistas that a wheelchair accessible: Green River Overlook, Buck Canyon Overlook, and White Rim Overlook. There is an easy 1/2 mile loop trail at Mesa Arch. Picnic tables are available at White Rom Overlook at the southern end of the scenic drive and at Upheaval Dome at the northern end of the scenic drive. There is no food available in the park. Take another day and visit The Needles District, which is 65 mi. south of Moab (one way) on Hwy. 191 near Monticello, UT. Again, you are driving about 34 mi (one way) over a paved road in open range to access the park. There are no services, go be sure you have plenty of gas. In this section of the park, you are driving 6.5 mi. (one way) along the Colorado River Valley with the canyon walls on either side. The scenery is breathtaking. There is another section along Hwy. 191 closer to Moab called The Needles Overlook. You are driving 22 mi. (One way) over a paved road in the open range with no services. You climb up to a mesa that overlooks The Needles area for a different perspective. This vantage point is park land, so you have a parking lot, pit toilets, and a paved path along the viewpoint. These 2 Needles sectons will take a whole day if you do no hiking. You could spend a whole week hiking here. There are campgrounds in both sections.Bring plenty of water, a hat, sunscreen, sturdy shoes, and your own snacks/lunch.","April 18, 2017","Allow 2 days if you are only driving and taking photos, a week if you really want to hike",596,"Austin, Texas",4
Canyonlands National Park,"We visited Canyonlands during a few day visit in Moab. I think we would have opted to spend more time in Canyonlands - we just did the Isle of the Sky (northern section) and only had five hours to spend there, so drove the whole route and did some shorter hikes. After having dl e some longer hikes in Arches though, Isle of the Sky offered some foot rest with plenty of viewpoints and shorter hiking paths if you wanted to venture past the viewpoint parking lots a bit. It is a beautiful park, and with fewer visitors, so a nice way to escape some of the area's crowds.

Canyonlands National Park,"Unknown to us, this park had three sections. Island in the Sky is on the north side and close to Moab (45 minute drive) and of course the most busy but not as busy as Arches. Needles is on the south side about an hour and a half drive from Moab and not as crowded as Island in the Sky. From Needles you can view the Confluence which is where the Colorado and the Green River merger down Cataract Canyon and become more powerful. We did the Chesler Viewpoint loop hike of 6 miles and the Cave Springs half mile hike which goes to an old cowboy camp. The third section is very remote and accessible only by four wheel drive and its called Maze. Canyonlands has a number of Arches and interesting hikes and remnants of a cowboy era in the park. Stop at the Ranger Station and get input to a hike that will work for you. Amazing views and great hikes. At Needles we did the Neck Spring hike which is almost 6 miles and goes from the rim to the floor of the canyon in a loop. We also did the Murphy Point hike of 3.6 miles and was also a loop.

Canyonlands National Park,Enjoyed our 1 day in the park and did as much as time allowed. Took several hikes and visited most all of the recommended places on the park map. Truly an amazing display of God's handiwork for everyone to see. April was a wonderful time to visit with pleasant daytime temperatures. The crowds were not huge and it was very easy to move from 1 vantage point to the next. The highlight for me was taking our rental jeep on the trail that connects Canyonland with Moab. It was a 2 to 2 1/2 hour drive that gave you a much better view point of the canyon from the top to bottom. Truly a spectacular way to end the day. Not for the faint of heart though as the height and switchbacks can be very intimidating! Don't miss this adventure.,"April 12, 2017",So much to see and so little time.,15,"Winter Springs, FL",5
Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands is about 80 km away from Moab. However, the trip is worth it! I did the Spring Neck Trail, which is part of the difficult hike of Canyonlands. It goes from the trim down to the canyon and up again. I was not expecting such amazing scenery. I enjoyed every single step of it! Then I went to Meza Arch.

Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands NP is a place you can drive off road for hours, hike, and find a ton of photo opportunities. The park is huge and divided into three areas - the maze, needles district, and island in the sky. You cannot drive from one district to another without leaving the park, though. So, if you are in Moab and don't have a ton of time, Island in the sky is the place to go. For a quick driving experience that will elevate your heart rate, hit the Shafer Switchback trail; if, after the drive, you need to hike off some anxiety, there are a number of trails that are relatively short (1-3 miles) and easy, like mesa arch, whale rock, and upheaval dome. If hiking is not your thing, island in the sky district has viewpoint after viewpoint of amazing scenery. It is hard to understand how something so barren is so beautiful, but canyonlands is proof. With regard to the needles district, it is about 75 miles from Moab and is aptly named because of the rock formations. This district would be second on the list, time permitting. I did not visit the maze because it is further yet and more remote with regard to services. If roughing it is up your alley, it is my understanding that the maze is likely your thing.As an aside, if you visit Island in the sky, it's worth the $15 to visit the adjacent Dead Horse Point State Park. Don't let the name deter you. Utah has done an amazing job developing this park through roads, hiking trails, and visitor facilities.

There are many good hiking trails. If you have time to apply for permits in advance, a mountain bike and/or 4x4 trip around the White Rim trip is a life experience..The Needles District is as beautiful as anywhere on the planet. I finally hiked every single trail south of the main road just trying to find one that wasn't breath takingly beautiful. There aren't any. No matter what you choose to hike, it's tremendous here.The Maze takes more time (overnight hiking or serious 4X4) to explore, but is beautiful as well if you have several days and the experience to do it.This is probably one of the best national parks in the U.S.","April 10, 2017",A must see national park!,87,"Fort Collins, Colorado",5

Canyonlands National Park,"We had a lot of fun hiking to different places. Mesa Arch is an easy hike with rocks to picnic on. Careful the Arch is right on the cliff side so don't sit too far back or you could fall straight down.Aztec rock splits off to see a native peoples granary. It looks like a house ok pictures but you have to hike along a steep incline to get to it. There is one steep rock face to climb to get to it also. We didn't go up to Aztec Mesa, it looked to difficult with our young kids.Upheaval Dome to the lower viewing area has a few inclined on some rough trail but is pretty good. You got some steep edges or cliff edges and some more inclined to hike to the Upper viewing area. Our three year old hiked up and back by herself with hand holding on cliff edges for safety. It is a challenging hike to continue to the upper area but you can see more of the crater and it was worth it in our opinion.Grandview Point was great to see the Canyon as well as the Needles off in the distant.

Canyonlands National Park,"Spent 2 different days hiking here on our spring trip in March 2017. Our first day was a Sunday and it was really crowded and hard to find parking sports at places like the V.C. We did serval hikes including Mesa Arch (the first of many Arches we saw on this trip). Easy 1 mile RT hike, so anyone can do it. Also hiked Grand View Point - and Wow! The panoramic view was amazing. Climb to the top of the rocks at the end of the hike for an even better view and lunch spot, approx 2 miles RT. Also did the Whale Rock, approx. 1 mile RT hike - the kids really like this one. Lots of scrambling, especially since they decided to go further then the blow hole and reach the head. We went back for a second day in this park on Thursday and wow - were did everyone go. lol WAY less crowded on a week day and so nice. We did the White Rim overlook - and these were the best views by far! Wish we all could have fit in a jeep to take the drive on the white rim road - looked awesome from above. And Solitude! We only saw like 2 other people on this hike and had the overlook all to ourselves for lunch. Easy, level almost 2 mile RT hike. Must do! We didn't get a chance to get over to the Needles District, but hope to make it there next time we visit Utah. Overall way less crowded then Arches and lots of great views and hikes. Don't think I'd spend more then 2 days in the Island in the Sky area - you'll run out of things to do. Great NP, much different then what we are used to. Well worth a stop for at least a day if in the area. Do make sure you have plenty of supplies, gas, water, food, etc, before leaving Moab or other towns.

Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands National Park consists of many interesting spots, overlooks and trails. I was visiting the Island in the Sky. I saw about 75 percent wat’s there. It took me about 9 hours to go through these attractions. My speed was not as great as I would like, because I had a camera and I was taking hundreds of pictures. But generally it was worth of everything. Any mile , any view was a great experience. The rock formations are awesome, but along with the light from sunrise or sunset this place is like a paradise. Bring the good hiking shoes if you want to go deeper, not staying only on the overlooks. In some areas rocks are loose and you have to protect your feet and ankles. Bring with you a sun-screen, container with water(refills are available by the visitor center). Don’t forget to cover the head and use the sun glasses. That all will help you to fully enjoy this awesome place. I was there in March, so the temperature was in 50-60’s. I was using the sun-screen but I had the sunburn in spots I’ve missed applying the sunscreen. Bring also the food if you want to stay there all day. There is no grocery stores around.During driving in the park, be careful.

Bring way more water than you believe you could ever drink, good boots, sun protection, lip balm and a sense of humor. The summers are scorchers, so don't underestimate your need for water and sun protection. The humidity is low, so even in winter you will need quite a bit of water for hiking.Tell someone where you are going to hike and when you expect to return. Make sure they know to call emergency if you do not return when expected. No cell reception, so don't expect google earth to help you find your way.Be sure to make a stop at Upheaval Dome.

You feel so small in comparison to the depths of the canyons and crevices. We enjoyed an easy hike on the Mesa Arch trail (.5 miles roundtrip) and the Grand View Point (1.8 miles roundtrip). It wasn't too busy and there were many times we were hiking alone. Around every corner is a new and amazing site. We loved it and can't wait to go back and adventure more.

Of course, I had to yell at some idiot posing for pictures on top of the arch, after he had passed 2 signs stating to stay off of it. Might need a bigger ranger presence there, I'm sure it happens a lot. We also did Grand View hike at the end, that was the best.

There were plenty of other hikes to choose from if we had more time. This park is best for able-bodied people, as there aren't as many overlooks or paved paths compared to other National Parks.

Canyonlands National Park,"In compare to the nearby national parks (i.e., Arches or Bryce), Cayonlands isn't as popular. There is no doubt that the park is a wonder as unique and wonderful as any other well-known parks. However, it is difficult to access to all the regions of the park. The parks is divided into three regions: Island in the Sky on the north, the Maze on the west, and the Needles on the east. Traveling between these regions requires two to six hours by cars as there are no roads in the park that directly link the three districts. Of all its different regions, Island in the Sky is the one that is most visited as it is the closest to Arches National Park in Moab. That was where we visited. All three regions offer a lot of opportunities for exploration and adventure. Nowadays Canyonlands remains largely untrammeled - its roads mostly unpaved, trails primitive, and rivers free-flowing.

Canyonlands was far down the bucket list. January 2017 was my first visit and won't be my last. You will find Canyonlands on US 191 then on to route 211 West, about 55 miles South of Moab, Utah. The jaw dropping views as you descend into the Colorado River are every bit as beautiful as can be imagined and deliver the aesthetic punch to the gut that you are seeking. Try hitting the peak of the scenery mid afternoon (in the winter) as the sun begins to retreat to the West. I decided to visit Newspaper Rock on the return to Moab and what a shame it would have been had I not taken the time to see this marvel of man.

We visited in January and the weather was very cold and windy. We did a minimal amount of hiking, but drove many roads within the park and with no crowds, it was easy to pull to the side and observe. We were disappointed that the visitor's center was not open. We enjoy going into the center's and learning about the area and picking up maps, literature, etc. Due to us not having much gas, we drove into Moab before visiting Canyonlands and stopped at Arches Visitor's Center.

Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands is amazing! I have been to national parks all over the country and this park easily ranks among the most stunning landscapes I have seen. Miles and miles of buttes and carved red rock canyons. Access is divided into two main sections: Needles and Island in the Sky. Needles district is the southern section, about 75 miles south of Moab near Monticello. There are two paved roads into this area (both off US191), the main entrance which is Route 211 and Needles Overlook Rd. which is Route 133. On Rt. 211 you will drive among towering red rocks buttes. Once you reach the park, you can hike, overlook Big Spring Canyon or take an unpaved scenic drive through canyons and hoodoos to Elephant Hill at Soda Springs. We did this drive in a low-clearance 2WD passenger car, but I don't recommend it if it has rained recently or is forecast (best to stop at the visitor center to inquire about road conditions). Needles Overlook Rd. goes 22 miles (one-way) off US191 to a viewpoint that overlooks a maze of canyons below.Island in the Sky district is closer to Moab and Arches National Park. If you are traveling to Moab, I strongly suggest that you visit Island in the Sky. In my opinion, it is just as spectacular as Arches (if not more so) and when we went it was also less crowded. In Island in the Sky you are atop a large mesa from which you can see stunning panoramic views of the canyons below carved by the Green and Colorado Rivers. Access is off US191 via Route 313, Grand View Point Rd. It is 33 miles (one-way) to Grand View Point.We visited both the above areas of Canyonlands in one day, starting at Monticello and visiting Needles first, then stopping for lunch in Moab before exploring Island in the Sky in the afternoon. (We didn't go to Needles Overlook because we had seen it on a previous visit). We had time to stop at all the points of interest, and did a few of the shorter hikes at Pothole Point, Shafer Point, Mesa Arch, Whale Rock, and Upheaval Dome. This is doable if you don't mind a lot of driving. Obviously if you want to do more hiking or biking, take a 4WD on White Rim Rd. or a guided tour then you will need than one day. If your time is limited and you have to choose, then go to Island in the Sky. The best views are at Shafer Canyon, Green River Overlook, Grand View Point and Buck Canyon Overlook. Island in the Sky also offers the best viewing opportunities for people who use wheelchairs.The best times to visit are spring and fall. Summer can be dangerously hot if you're not acclimated with thunderstorms. Winter gets quite cold and snow is possible (elevation 6000'). Check the forecast before you go and always have plenty of water and hat and sunscreen any time of year - there is not much shade. Fill your vehicle with gas and take snacks as there is no food service in the park except perhaps some limited items at the visitor centers or camp store (Needles). Admission is $25/car (good for 7 days) and they also accept NPS access passes.","January 5, 2017",Don't Miss This Natural Wonder!,1781,"Tucson, Arizona",5

We also went to Aztec Butte. We were there with friends and had kids age 7-14 and all of them loved the hike to the top of Aztec Butte. The 360 degree view from the top will take your breath away. You can look for miles in all directions and see no civilization, just huge deep canyons. It took us about 1.5 hours to do the full hike.

Canyonlands National Park,"We made a 4 day three night trip along the white rim trail that included three nights of camping at some of the best camp sites in the country. But the road is not for the faint of heart or for anything but a competent 4x4 vehicle. You start out on dirt road into the part and immediately come to the Shaffer Trail which is a switch back, steep, narrow, and breath taking road down to the white rim. All I can say, is do not look down! I did and almost lost my breakfast. The first turn is the width of the car track and the drop off is 3000 feet, with nothing between you and the canyon bottom below. Once you get down to the white rock area mid way to the bottom (White Rim) which encircles the green river and Colorado river, the road is narrow and bumpy with several tight turns, but very doable. The scenery is amazing. 1/3 of the way as you approach Murphy camping area you climb back up. When I say climb, I mean go straight up with one scary turn. 4 low with hood pointing at the sky, not horizon, I mean Mars! We camped at Airport, Murphy and hard scrabble. All by permit only, spread out and quite with toilet facilities. No fires, but some of the best camping I have experienced. Oh, Did I mention to get to hard Scrabble you once again have to climb straight up to the camp site, and then in the new morning go straight down? Yes, 4 low and scary. We passed some the best scenery you can imagine, including the Washer Woman and several natural arches. The final climb up at Mineral Bottom is steep, but the road is wide, making for slow steep climb, but easy compared to the other white knuckle climbs and descents. Don't let the scary road dissuade you, many have passed before you and my wife did it two more times after her first trip. I think she is crazy, but then again the road is heavily rutted so there must be a lot of crazy folks out there. On our trip we did see one outfitter who offered trips in their SUVs to camping areas set up by them. That way you can just close your eyes and you go up and down!

We visited the former on our way from Monument Valley to Moab and the latter whilst we were staying in Moab. Be aware that both are some way off the main road so be sure to have plenty of gas in the tank and also remember to take plenty of water. You can top containers up at the Visitor Centre but you cannot but bottles of water; this is to reduce the plastic bottle detritus risk to the environment. Both districts are well worth a visit, allow as much time as you can to make the most of it. The Needles district in particular offers camping over several sites, it must make for a wonderful outdoor vacation! Both have plenty of places to park the car and have a closer look at the view points with differing options depending on how fit you are!

However, it has its own charm that is best explored with off road vehicles. There are actually three parts of the park, as defined by the Green and Colorado rivers. Island in the Sky is the main section with the most number of visitors. The Mesa portion gets very few visitors and accessible from US24 (not from Moab). Needles is also less visited and a bit harder to get to.Canyonlands has a very different feel than Arches. It is bigger and caters to more hiking and four wheeling. It has a lot less visitors and you can actually get away from the crowds that mobs Arches next door. There are several good hikes along the various canyon rims with dramatic vistas that reward the hiking effort. There are also many day and overnight hiking trails for those that are hardy.","November 5, 2016",Different view of the canyons,158,"Cary, NC",5

Canyonlands National Park,"We had visited Canyonlands National Park briefly earlier. But it turns out we missed the best. This time, we experienced it. First, not to be missed is the Needles Overlook, which, technically, isn't part of the park. You get there by driving south from Moah and then taking a 22 mile road east. The views are spectacular -- absolutely amazing. If there were only two things to see in the Moab area, I'd rate this right up there (or surpassing) Arches National Park. The second great experience at Canyonlands was the Joint Trail in the Needles area of the park. We took the longer loop option (about 10+ miles), but you could skip the loop and go right to the Joint if you wish. The crevice is the highest and longest we've encountered anywhere, and the sights on the way out and back are amazing.","November 3, 2016",Two Highlights of Canyonlands,96,Indiana,5

Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands is atop a large mesa. As you drive or bicycle through you come to amazing vistas of the canyon below. There are trails that take you to even more spectacular vistas. There is a nice easy hike called Murphy's that takes only about 1 hour in and back. You walk along a sandy trail past an antique corral. Then the trail opens up to vistas of some of the formations below in the canyon. You can see the ""Candlestick"" and you can see the ""Needles"" a large area of tall red rock forms. This is a nice trail to begin with. We also hiked a long trail called Neck Spring that took us down into the canyon past some antique watering troughs for cattle. This was moderate hiking, but it was also moderately difficult and a bit scary as the trail went along the edges of the canyon wall several times. The hike took 4 hours. At times it seemed we would not reach the exit from the canyon back up to the mesa. The exit route was up a rock slope, not too difficult. Then the return to the trailhead was at least a mile, the last quarter mile being along the roadside. A thrilling hike. Most hikes are more thrilling that that as they go down into the canyon along the rim trails. The rim trails offer you a wall on one side and the drop on the other. It's your choice. To hike down into the canyon or stay up top on the mesa.This is the beginning of the Grand Canyon as it is the Colorado River and Green River that cut this canyon. This is also a mecca for mountain biking along some of the rocky formations atop the mesa.","November 2, 2016",exciting and thrilling,8,"Gardner, Massachusetts, United States",4

Canyonlands National Park,"To those that are planning a trip, the park is broken down into three areas. The Maze District is only accessible via 4x4 and requires backpacking through most of it. The most popular is Island in the Sky. There is a visitors center and it is pretty close to Moab. This area has a bunch of shorter hikes as well as some longer hikes. I recommend Mesa Arch and Upheaval Dome. The third area is The Needles. This visitors center and area is about 1.5 hour drive south of Moab. Make sure to fill up your car with gas and bring food and water bottles. There are no services the entire drive from Moab except a small shop with expensive pumps right outside the park. There are a lot of campsites in this area of the park and it is definitely less visited. I wish we had known there were so many, we would have camped. There are only 3 shorter hikes in this area and LOTS of long hikes. One could spend a week backpacking through all the hikes in the needles. We loved it this area of the park as well.

The Island in the Sky mesa provided a panoramic view of the vast, flat formations. This was as impressive as the Grand Canyon's south rim. Every national park in Utah had a unique character.

Canyonlands National Park,"For me, the Needles District is the most spectacular part of Canyonlands NP. There are numerous trails from short to long all of which are worthwhile. This year we backpacked into Elephant Canyon and spent 2 nights at EC3. Absolute quiet at night except for a few day hikers using headlamps to return to the trailhead. We were able to pump water at a large spring (about a mile away from camp) that allowed us to carry less water for our stay. We hiked to Druid Arch (on my 70th birthday:-) and found it absolutely amazing. It is completely unlike any other sandstone arch that I know of - Stonehenge in the desert. While a long hike, the Joint Trail is a treat that I recommend. It incorporates 1/8 mile +/- of trail at the bottom of deep crevasses/joints in the rock (60' +/-) and one underground section. The shade is a welcome relief.If you go, pay a lot of attention to your water needs. It is better to have too much.","October 30, 2016",Druid Arch and the Needles District,65,"Westcliffe, Colorado",5
Canyonlands National Park,"The views at Canyonlands, compared with our other experiences in Moab, were somewhat disappointing. Perhaps it was the lighting. Perhaps we've been to the Grand Canyon and Canyonlands just didn't excite us.By the way, make sure you drive up scenic highway 128 along the Colorado River. Some of the views were just spectacular. If you stay in Moab, highway 128 is easy to get to, with lots of places to pull over and enjoy.

Canyonlands National Park,"The drive from Moab to Canyonlands National Park (Needles District) on its own is incredible. Before you get to the Canyons you come across Newspaper Rock. Be sure to pull over because it is worth seeing (see another review for details). The Needles District forms the southeastern portion of Park. Its signature features are colorful sandstone spires - hundreds of them poking up from the desert floor. There are also entrenched canyons, natural arches and sheer-walled cliffs in this vast, rugged landscape. If you decide to hike the the Elephant Hill Trail, you have to drive 3 miles on a narrow dirt road, be prepared to stop and back into a space to allow other vehicle to pass (not my favorite part). Also note that cell phone doesn't work there. so stay with your party. The hike is worth it but if you are not an athlete, be careful, take it slow, wear comfortable shoes and clothing.

We started with the short hike/easy walk to Mesa Arch. The views through the Arch are incredible. It's crowded, but worth the trip. Next we hiked to Upheaval Dome's two overlooks. The trip to Overlook 2 is well worth the extra effort. Next we headed to Grand View Point trail. This easy out and back hike gave us a sense of the size and majesty of this National Park. It's pretty amazing to view the Green River and the Colorado River from such spectacular vantage points all on the same hike. Grand View Point was really crowded! We had lunch at White Rim Overlook and then decided to hike the trail to the Overlook. It was our favorite hike of the day. We were the only people at the Overlook and the views of Monument Basin were incredible. The park rangers at the Visitors Center were pretty smug and not terribly interested in providing any information beyond highlighting our map with the standard most popular spots. Oh well.

You can imagine that you are looking back in time about 250 million years as the multiple and attractive layers of sedimentary rock descend to the canyon floor.

It's easy to underestimate how hard the work is, but we did the ~11 mile hike in under 3 hours and 30 minutes. We were in good shape, and I can easily imagine the hike taking some groups 5+ hours.The scenery is unreal -- with rocks and canyons carved by time. Druids arch is impressive. The last quarter mile hike up is tough. We camped at the Canyonlands my first time a few years ago, and carrying all the water for 3 days was a serious haul. In heat.

Also inspiring was to view the brave souls who took narrow trails/roads down from the top to the bottom of the canyons on bicycles, There are many drop-offs next to the trails so that this may not be a park for young children to visit unless they are held by the hand or under strict verbal control.

Canyonlands National Park,"We decided to visit all five national parks in Utah and are happy we visited Canyonlands. There are three districts: Island in the Sky, The Needles, and The Maze and each is unique. We went to the Island in the Sky district which is a mesa that rests on sheer sandstone cliffs over 1000 feet above the surrounding terrain. Each overlook offers a different perspective on the park's spectacular landscape. There is a 34 mile roundtrip scenic drive. We saw the breathtaking views of the snow-capped La Sals mountains. We went to the end of the road to the Grand View Point Overlook. The awe inspiring views of the canyon are similar to the Grand Canyon, but much smaller. There are spectacular views at the other overlooks. We hiked to see the Upheaval Dome, the oddest geological feature, a crater possibly made by a meteor. Canyonlands preserves a wilderness of rocks where water and gravity are the architects. They cut flat layers of sedimentary rock into hundreds of canyons, buttes, fins, arches and spires. At center stage are two canyons carved by the Green and Colorado rivers. This park is a gem that should be visited more. I highly recommend coming here.","October 13, 2016",Should Be Visited More,34,"Fort Worth, Texas",5

It is one of the least visited parks and after seeing big crowds at nearly every park we loved being alone!! Canyonland is too big to see in one day. It is definitely a diverse park and they recommend you divide it into 4 areas. I had read just a little about it and wanted to go to Island in the sun, but didn't realize the geography of the park made it impossible to get there from the entrance south of Moab. You have to take the entrance North of Moab to reach it. We enjoyed the Needles side if the park. We were able to get in a 4 mile hike that was well marked with cairns and sat in the shade during the hike to enjoy a quiet lunch. We saw only two other couples on this hike called ""slickrock"".

Canyonlands National Park,"We spent one day at Arches, then Canyonlands and Deadhorse Point State Park the next. Canyonlands is a good park - don't get me wrong. But Arches is a hard act to follow, particularly at this time of year when it's not too crowded. If you can do both, do it (and also include Deadhorse Point). But if you have to choose, I'd go with Arches, The Canyonlands (Island in the Sky section) visitor center is pretty simple - doesn't compare to the one at Deadhorse Point SP. We made three hikes - Mesa Arch (0.5mile), Grand View Point (2 mi) and Upheaval Dome 1st overlook (1.0 mi). We're seniors, and the hiking was a bit more difficult than the Arches trails. Quite a lot of elevation change and stone steps on all three hikes. The Mesa trail is a loop trail but most folks went out and back, making the back side loop very quiet and nice.. The steps had long runs and often steep rise (a bit more than comfortable) on the steeper parts of both Grand View and Upheaval Dome. Upheaval Dome is pretty much all uphill going out and all down coming back. If you have sensitive knees, wear your brace! Grand View Point our favorite - great vistas.","October 11, 2016",Hard to beat Arches,23,,4

Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands is divided into two sections--Island in the Sky and the Needles District. Island in the Sky is a huge mesa with a road that takes visitors almost to the end point of the mesa. With spectacular views of the canyon floor surrounding the mesa, you can see for miles in many directions. There are several hiking trails--a favorite was to Mesa Arch, which is on the canyon rim and has a beautiful view through the arch. Another was the Grand View Trail (appropriately named!) which starts at the Grand View Overlook and follows the canyon rim to the end of the mesa for spectacular views of the surrounding landscape. Much of the park is accessible only with 4 wheel drive vehicles. You will be awed by the views and the canyon landscape. Bring water if you plan to hike! Getting to the Needles district requires a drive around the park to the southern end--about an hour from Moab. Again, there are beautiful hikes with amazing views. The rock formations are different than those at Island in the Sky, and we enjoyed both parts of the park. We hiked the Slickrock trail, which was beautiful. The drive into the park is awe-inspiring. Stop at Newspaper Rock to view the Native American paintings on the rock before you get to the park.

It is much like the Grand Canyon with its canyon views, but has grasslands and open range ranching also. We visited Mesa Arch-truly more amazing than any of the Arches in Arches National Park, if not just for its spectacular views through the arch but its approachability.

It was worth the effort. Ate lunch at a picnic area. Then we got in the car and drove all the way down 191 to the Needles entrance.

It had awesome canyons, good hikes to see more of the park, at least 1 arch, and some spires, buttes, and mesa views.

We brought picnic and spent lunch in one of their designates picnic areas with individual covered pergolas with its own parking which was lovely, however it was very windy up there so we could not bring the food out so we ended up eating in the car.Some of the view points we did was Grand View Point, buck canyon, white rim, green river overlook, shafer canyon and we also hiked the mesa arch! My wife and I had our 6 y old daughter and a friend couple in their 60s who all enjoyed the easy hikes there. We had such great memories of this Park on our 1 week Arizona-Utah trip and I can see myself coming back to this Park! I have this habit of ranking the National Parks I've seen, and this is probably my new favorite National park!

We continued to the crater to do the loop trail around the and into the crater. It is very nice hike with great views. It is steep at times, requires some rock climbing and is not for the faint of heart. If you are not an experienced hiker don't do it. It is very rewarding. The good news is that only very few people do the loop trail. We met less than 10 people while hiking for 6 hours.

Just ignore the silly folks who always seem to get too close to the edge of big drop offs, or are in areas that are marked as closed.

Canyonlands National Park,"Of the 4 districts, ""Island in the Sky"" is the most visited, easiest to get to, and the most pedestrian friendly. The 4 districts are not connected at all; a visitor has to leave the park and travel quite a ways for each of the other district entries.The other 3 districts are:Needles - the furthest drive to get to day trip or back country hiking and backpacking.Maze - the most remote and rugged (4-wheel drive high-clearance vehicle required)The Rivers - boating but there is no potable water and boats must carry an approved toilet system.So, that leaves ""Island in the Sky"" district as the most popular with tourists who want to drive on paved roads and spend shorter periods of time sight-seeing. It is an excellent option.From Moab, it takes about 40 minutes to drive 22 miles to the visitor center for the park. Entry fee at the guard station is $25 per car but holders of the Senior Pass pay nothing. Along the paved road, there are many turn-outs with signage describing the view. There is s 34 mile scenic round-trip drive through the Island in the Sky district. It is best to stop at the visitor center (open daily) to pick up any brochures, maps, and brochures to plan stops and sight-seeing. The rangers are also helpful, answering any and all questions. The visitor center is also like a mini-museum of facts for the area. There is also a short film on the park.For most casual visitors, the mild and moderate levels are popular hiking choices. Moderate hikes can include 1,000 to 2,000 foot elevation changes, with paths leading up sandstone surfaces or descending pathways into canyons. Most times, there are steps (in some shape or form) to guide the hiker along the cairn-marked pathways. Pack water along; there is none to be had on the paths, and the sun is hot and there is no shade (or only tiny bits every now and then). Almost all the trail heads or feature points in Canyonlands are the subject of separate TA reviews under the TA location of ""Canyonlands National Park"" (not under Moab). Canyonlands' ""Island in the Sky"" district lists 9 separate easy-to-moderate trails along the Mesa Top. There are 10 other trails are found elsewhere and they are ranked as strenuous (requiring the skills and abilities of a mountain goat).The views are unlike any other national park; they are all really distinct. This park offered a couple of arches, panoramic views of wide open spaces, and sandstone rocks to hike. it was, at some time, a little like going to Sedona but then, the edge of a cliff would pop up and breathtaking forever views would remind us this is really, really different.All the National Parks are treasures that should see at some time in our lives. This is an easy to navigate park, family-friendly, and navigable for the less mobile, too.

Canyonlands National Park,"The island in the sky district is easy to get to and there must be 15 places to pull off the road and get incredible views of the surrounding canyons and Green and Colorado rivers. There are several short flat hikes to bring you even closer to the canyons for better photos and views (1-3 miles RT). Each pull off has a different view so it is definitely worth going to all of them. We have a 4WD Toyota 4Runner so we went down Shafer Trail Road to Potash to get back to Moab. Road looks very scary from above but is not really that bad once you get on it. We took a side trip on the way down to Musselman Arch, which is on the White Rim road about 4 miles down. 45 minutes RT and easily done and worth it. Once you get on potash, road becomes more of a 4 wheel drive road but a pretty easy one. Going down it's probably manageable with a 2WD SUV. You do need a little clearance in a few spots. There's a beautiful vista of the gooseneck of the Colorado on the way. Took us about 3 hours from top of shafer to Moab, including the side trip to Musselman.

The sunrise awakens the colors of the canyons and it is awe inspiring to see the reds, oranges, browns come to life. This park is mainly for the more active viewers who want to bike, or off road to see the inside of the canyons and enjoy the views up close and personal.

Also hiked to grand view point, but it wasn't as impressive as the drive-to overlooks, so if you are pressed for time, just drive to overlooks and hike to Mesa Arch (it's short and relatively easy with just a small elevation gain).","September 21, 2016",Must hike to mesa arch and overlooks,36,"Hilton Head, South Carolina",5

Not for faint of heart, though.Yell into the canyon and listen for the echo. Sing! No shade, so an umbrella is a great idea.Gets very dusty, close or cover everything.

This part of the park is located just north of where the Green River joins the Colorado river. From high on the mesa, you can look down on both canyons. There are numerous lookout stops, where you can get out of your car and take a look at the best views. Sometimes there is a short walk to get an even better view. There are also many hikes to take at various skill levels. Come with a full tank of gas, water and anything you plan on eating, sunscreen and a hat. Good walking shoes and walking sticks are a plus as the trails are rocky and uneven. We picked up a couple of beautiful coffee mugs at the visitors center.

There are no new services that I have found, just a huge price increase that the hordes of foreign tourists don't seem to mind paying.

Definitely wear a hat and bring lots of water. And please be careful taking photos near dangerous precipices no matter how inviting. We saw some folks literally gambling with their lives. From downtown Moab the drive is about an hour to the scenic overlook at the end of the road. Start there and enjoy the light changing your perspective throughout the day.

You drive yourself at your own pace through this park, and take a short hike to the scenic overlooks. Just the drive into the park was worth the trip. You come in through the canyons, and eventually end up at the top to enjoy the overlooks. The only bad thing was the bugs. There were little gnats that were too pesty anytime you stood still, so we did not get to just sit and enjoy any location for long.

Canyonlands National Park,"We drove from Moab to visit the ""Island In The Sky"" portion of the park. Some previous reviewers have been disappointed because this is not the Grand Canyon. On an ""awesomeness"" scale with Grand Canyon being a ten, this is about a seven or eight. The canyon views are good, but not ""Grand"". If you want an amazing trip, take Shafer Trail and Potash Road back to Moab. This is a dirt, rocky road that hugs the side of cliffs from the visitor center down to the canyon floor. Best done in a Jeep Wrangler. We did it in a Jeep Liberty (small 4WD SUV) which had sufficient clearance. If you are considering this road, stop at the visitor center to discuss the road and vehicle requirements with one of the rangers. Then, walk across the street to Shafer Canyon Overlook, walk out to the edge, and view the road. You should see vehicles taking the route. Once you start down, there is no opportunity to chicken out and turn around. This was one of the most scary but exhilarating things I have ever done. I thought my wife was going to throw up. I had a dash camera that provided video that shocked friends and family. Google ""Shafer Canyon Road"" to find descriptions of the road and many youtube videos. The view driving the canyon floor was amazing. Probably similar to taking a rafting trip through the Grand Canyon.","September 2, 2016",Took Shafer Canyon Trail,18,"Plano, Texas",5

Canyonlands National Park,This park takes more time than some of the others because it takes more time to get there from Moab and more driving in the park to see the views. You will be able to see some very nice views from the road and parking areas but you will see even more if you do some hiking. Nice areas set up to stop and eat lunch. This park offers some 4 wheeling. There is a 100 mile 4 heel drive road that goes around the park. You can see the roads going through the canyons from the viewing areas. ,"August 28, 2016",Lot of driving for the views.,27,"Springfield, Illinois",4
Canyonlands National Park,"Yes, it is a bit of a drive...yes, you will wish there were more viewpoints, but the canyons are phenomenal. Though we tried hard to imagine how early inhabitants felt about walking up to the edge of Island in the Sky, it had to be heart pounding. Sheer drop offs, fiery red pinnacles, and miles and miles of undulating canyons. The rivers looking like tiny silver threads wound so tightly against canyon walls!

Canyonlands National Park,"My son and I made a trip to see the Mighty 5 in Southern Utah.Canyonlands National Park was the 4th in the series.This park was formed, like the others, from water. Specifically the Colorado River and its tributaries . Sounds familiar? Reminds you of the Grand Canyon but more intimate, also squared. The Colorado River runs parallel to the Green River leaving you on a piece of land/ meadows in the center named the Island in the Sky. These dueling canyons harken you back to the Grand Canyon they collide together at the end of the park in still even more overwhelming scenic beauty. Just when you think you have seen enough Bam!

The arches are not quite as spectacular as in Arches NP, but the views are amazing none the less. Picnic tables throughout the park as well.

It was an overcast day, but the beauty was evident.

In the few hours we had we were able to visit some of the more iconic attractions and take in the breathtaking sights, but I wish we had more time to spend.

Canyonlands National Park,"Visited Canyonlands today and it was lovely. Stayed in the Island in the Sky portion as The Needles is 75 miles or so from Moab. It's definitely a little more rustic, if you will, than Arches. Only port-o-potties at the visitor's center (sadly this was a big deal for me) :)Went to the Grand View Point, Whale Rock and Mesa Arch hikes. All relatively short, benign hikes. Went early in the AM to Grand View -almost no one there. Love to hike in the quiet, solitude of the morning. It was a totally quiet and peaceful all around the rim. Go early...I am quite sure that it fills up later in the day.Though I didn't really care to see canyonlands initially, I soon realized my folly. The pictures do not do it justice. It's so vast and the colors of sunrise are amazing. I would highly recommend it!Whale rock was a fun, short scramble up slick rock. Great views...loved it. Mesa Arch is one of those highly photographed arches that you see in pictures. It's also beautiful and probably best at sunrise, if possible.For most, it's a great half day experience. The longer hikes have to do with steep downward descents with even more difficult ascents at the end. ","August 23, 2016",Beautiful but out in the middle of nowhere,114,,5

Canyonlands National Park,"every year, my family ( grandparents, parents, sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins... children, teens and adults) get together for a camping trip. We've been to Moab before and hiked through Arches national park, and it's a must do if you've never been there. However this year we checked out the Canyonlands, and we weren't disappointed. Right at the beginning, across from the visitor center is the first stop, and it's an understatement to call it breathtaking. We were here in mid-August, so the temps were mid to high 90's, but if you bring enough water, and fuel snacks, you can get in some fun and easy hikes. Some are more accessible than others, so just be sure to scope out the area before you head out from your car. There is the opportunity to venture out from the trails, in some places, but no matter which direction you go or look, you'll have an amazing view! Few tips: 1. Keep kids close, the edges are sheer cliffs with dangerous drops, so best to be ahead of curious children. 2. The rocks are frail to a great degree and tend to crumble under foot. Nothing extreme, but enough to make it slippery in areas, do it can be precarious terrain. 3. parking, the lots aren't big at the stops, so you want to get there early or may have to circle back and venture to the next site, 4. Hydrate!! 5. Choose to have someone take your pic instead of the traditional selfie, it's easy to get caught up in the views and the heights which makes for incredible photos, you may injure yourself not watching out for loose rocks and steep edges! It's worth the fee to get in, just know that military discounts are for active military, not Veterans ( which was a disappointing discover) & if you're a senior citizen, it's a best value to buy the lifetime pass. The drive there is awesome, the views pop up a few miles before you get to the park, makes it more exciting to see what's ahead. Have fun!!!","August 18, 2016",Family camping trip,1,"Westminster, Colorado",5

As the road is atop the mesa, we didn't get a chance to hike into the canyons, but the overlooks provided quite the experience.

Canyonlands National Park,"Physically so close together its scary - and yet worlds apart in challenge, in options, in feel. Canyonlands NP is divided into 3 sections - and they are not close to each other - in fact the driving time from the entrance to Island in the Sky to the Needles district is well over 2.5 hours! And yet as the Raven flies - it's very close. The Maze district was too challenging for our pay grade - but we did both of the other sections - and loved loved loved them. Unlike Arches - you don't see other cars, the campgrounds aren't packed, and the vistas are incredible. Sunset and Sunrise are big at this park - with Mesa Arch alone entertaining crowds of camera happy tourists. And worth the effort of course. Our favorite parts - the Junior Ranger Program (one of the best of our trip), the Cave Spring Walk - just be sure to find the ladders and climb up for the dome view, and the rock scramble at Big Spring Canyon Overlook. If you want something truly special - be sure to stop at Newspaper rock - on the right as you drive towards the park on 211. Very cool. This is a park for the outliers among us - folks looking to get away from the madding crowd. Go and enjoy.","August 8, 2016",I loved this park - but I can easily see why it's not for everyone,209,"Monteal, Quebec",5

Canyonlands National Park,"This National Park is made for easy viewing. Most all the scenic views and sights (like Mesa Arch) are within a mile of the parking lots with most just steps from your vehicle. After seeing Arches National Park, Mesa Arch was not anything special, but both the Green River Overlook, and the Grand View Point Overlook are great. The best view was from the end of the Grand View Point Overlook, which was an easy mile hike from the Grand View Point, which itself is at the end of the road from the Island in the Sky Visitor Center. I am sure that there are more and longer hikes that can be taken, but if short on time, this is a very easy park to see the main sights all in a few hours.Also, do not miss Dead Horse Point State Park when in this area.

Canyonlands National Park,"We visited the Island in the Sky while in Canyonlands. Soon we found out how it got it's name. It really gives you the impression that you are on an island in the sky. Immense views on vast valleys with canyons on the bottom of them. Like most national parks, toilets are not something you really want to visit, but the rest of the infrastructure is, as we have came to expect of the NPS, great. You can hike until you drop but we didn't; it was over 100 degrees fahrenheit and we thought it would be a bit much for our 'frail' bodies.

It takes some effort to get to the top of the Mesa but the basic rule of hikes in national parks is, if it takes a little effort you suddenly find yourself in open country.

You are gazing over canyons where the Colorado and Green rivers meet, and the view is jaw dropping! We went to viewpoints of each river, and on one stretch of road saw what looked like a golden eagle soaring over our car. It was huge!! There are lots of ravens around too, which I love to see. I was so glad to see this part of Canyonlands, and it was not as crowded as Arches. I found out that Canyonlands is open 24 hours!

Canyonlands National Park,"I've been to Moab before and I barely remembered Canyonlands, after going a second time I realize why. To be fair this review is for the Island in the Sky portion of Canyonlands. We showed up here and they apparently decided to close a few hikes because they were redoing the parking lots to these hikes. Arches was doing the same thing, but they let you park on the side of the road still allowing accessibility to their hikes. But what's a few hikes you may ask? There were two hikes closed when we came, they were both short hikes. There were two hikes left that weren't 4 hours long at min. We got to one right as they closed it off to redo the parking lot (no one told us this one would also be closed, the rangers had no idea), so we went on a quick 30 min. hike and went back to our car. Drove down another road and were also turned back. Who closes everything but 4-6 hour hikes? You guessed it. Everything else including the viewpoints were all closed. No notification on the website, nothing, the rangers didn't even know what was closed.

Canyonlands National Park,"Route 191 is the drive to take to enter this glorious, vast natural wonderland. We visited two out of the three parts of the park: Island in the Sky and Needles. Island in the Sky is closest to Moab and the most visited. I'd choose Island in the Sky to visit if you have limited time. The Green River and Colorado River are on the outskirts of the park. They merge in the Confluence overlook, near The Maze and The Needles area. Islands in the Sky - We drove the 34 mile round trip scenic drive. As you drive, you can park near or at several of the overlook areas to see the entire mesa top. You can buy or rent a self-guided driving CD at the visitor center. We hiked to Mesa Arch. It's a short half mile hike that leads to the cliffs edge. Stunning!!!!!! Major photo spot!!!The hikes in this section are easy, moderate and strenuous. Make sure to bring food and water! The Needles -- It took about an hour and half from Moab to get here. Take Rt 191 and drive 40 miles then take UT 211 for about 35 miles west. UT 211 ends in The Needles and is the ONLY paved road in and out of the area. Make sure you have gas because the only place to fill up is at the Needles Outpost. There is a 6.5 mile scenic drive past the visitors center. My family and I hiked Cave Spring. This is a 0.6 mile short loop that leads to a historic cowboy camp and prehistoric pictographs. Two ladders must be climbed to compete the route. This hike is considered easy. I didn't find it easy. I managed to get to the cowboy area but stopped and turned around at the ladders. We also hiked Pothole Point. This was another 0.6 mile, uneven slick rock path. The trail is lined with cairns to follow. Potholes were dry because it was hot, hot, hot! The hikes in this part of the park are either easy or strenuous. Make sure to bring food and water! The Maze is remote and can be accessed by four wheel drive. Check the visitor center for tours and information. I felt this park is less congested than the others. It is beautiful and vast! NOTE: Before entering The Needles area, on Rt UT 211 there is a sign for Newspaper Rock State Historic Park. This is a MUST STOP! This is ONE OF THE BEST displays of Indian rock art to be found anywhere in the U.S. It's also one of the few petroglyph sites that is so easily accessible and can be viewed and photographed at close range. Newspaper Rock is a series of petroglyphs etched in sandstone recording perhaps 2,000 years of human activity in the area. Just like art is in the eye of the beholder, so is the interpretation of this recording of time or ""newspaper"" communication. Amazing photo spot!!!

Canyonlands National Park,A must see. This park is so different to but complimentary to Arches. We visited Island in the Sky. A very fitting name. Drove up onto the plateau and the first amazing views were right opposite the Visitors centre! On one side views of a deep red canyon and rock sculptures carved out by the mighty Colorado River. On the other side of the park the Green River has carved out channels on a slightly smaller scale.

Canyonlands National Park,"It's a tribute to the Grand Canyon that Canyonlands isn't a widely revered national treasure and is, instead, one of our lesser known national parks. I was utterly unprepared for the scope and scale of the scenery encompassed by the park. We did not have as much time to spend as I would have liked--just a half a day to drive around Island in the Sky and picnic for dinner. We could easily have spent days, and my husband dreams of returning one day to do a helicopter tour. On a practical level, the bathrooms were plentiful, if typically spartan, and scenic points/trailheads/picnic areas were very well-marked.","July 13, 2016",Amazing.,63,"Sheboygan, Wisconsin",5

Maybe if we had taken a hike, we would have glimpsed more beauty close up. We probably should have chosen the Dead Horse Point state park instead.

Canyonlands National Park,"We stayed in Moab to visit arches and canyonlands. Canyonlands is a short drive from Moab but beware. There are 3 parts of the park and they aren't connected. We went to Needles first. We did a short hike called pothole hike. We saw almost dried up pools with shrimp swimming around. It was sort of cool for a desert area. They climbed up big rocks which was fun. There isn't a lot much else to do with two kids under 10. We headed up to Island in the Skye. We did a hike at Upheaval dome. We went to the first overlook and then the second. It was great. I wouldn't recommend the second overlook with little kids. There is a climb on a slick rock with stairs etched in. I felt uncomfortable bringing my 4 year old up it. The overlook scenic drive was amazing. You see the green river, old mining roads and the amazing canyon. In retrospect, I would have done the whole day at island in the Skye instead of needles and added another hike at Mesa arch.

One of the districts is closer to Capitol Reef.There are some great hiking trails. It would be good to go early during the summer due to how hot it can get. Make sure you take plenty of water and drink it. As well as sunscreen.If you are looking for history, they have that too. It's awesome, no matter which part you go to.

Canyonlands National Park,We had limited time so the park ranger recommended going to the north entrance to see the Island in the Sky section of Canyonlands. Canyonlands has four sections but this section allows visitors to see the canyons from lookout points that you can drive to. Other sections will require various hikes to see canyons. Keep a half tank of gas in your car since there's no gas stations once in the northern entrance. Camping is allowed in the park and there is a visitor center that closed at 6p when we visited. The park itself never closes. You will not regret visiting this attraction and see all the sections of Canyonlands if you can!!,"July 12, 2016",Stunning...,13,"Honolulu, Hawaii",5

It displays so much of the color that Utah is famous for. We saw whites, reds, blues, and purples in the park's rocks. Getting around by car is pretty easy when you do the Island in the Sky Trail. Other trails in the park are more taxing on a car or require 4 wheel drive. There are plenty of pull-offs so you can take photos and we never found it crowded anywhere. Take the time to read the informative signs at each of the stops to learn how Canyonlands came to be and how it is still evolving over time. You can not find fresh water in the park, so bring bottled water with you. Temperatures were in the 100s when we visited, so it was needed. The visitor station we stopped at had portable toilets with no running water to wash your hands, but we had hand sanitizer with us, so that helped.

Canyonlands National Park,"""The most weird, wonderful, magical place on earth—there is nothing else like it anywhere."" That is how author Edward Abbey described the largest National Park in the state of Utah by land area, Canyonlands National Park, located near Moab. It is where Colorado and Green Rivers meet, and the rivers divide the National Park into three districts: the Island in the Sky (north), the Needles (south), and the remote Maze (west). The most accessible district of Canyonlands NP from Moab, Utah, is the Island in the Sky district, home to a highly popular Mesa Arch. The Island in the Sky district also offers several overlooks from where visitors can glance down at the landscape.The Needles district, which is 1.5 hours of driving from Moab, contains several long-distance hiking trails that are rated as strenuous, including the ones leading to Druid Arch and where one can look at the confluence of two aforementioned rivers. The Maze district is the least accessible of the three districts, requiring a long, long drive on an unpaved road from the San Rafael Swell area.","June 23, 2016",Utah's largest National Park by land area,74,"Clearfield, Utah",5

If you had told me this was the Grand Canyon I would have believed you, its so huge and truly beautiful! Figure about 3-4 hours if not hiking. We have nothing like this in PA. We found that as we visited each park the only word we could come up with was WOW each time. Make sure you drive rte 9 and rte 12, and the Moki Dugway if you're brave enough.","June 23, 2016",WOW,107,"Myerstown, PA",5
Canyonlands National Park,"Maybe we saw too much. Maybe we had National Park Hangover. Maybe the other parks had set the bar too high. Whatever the reason, I was not as ""wowed"" by Canyonlands. Yes, the views are spectacular, yes its beautiful, but I felt a bit like Caesar, ""I came, I saw, I took a selfie."" Compared to Arches or Dead Horse State Park, Canyonlands didn't have the wow factor that the other two did for me. I think the views from Dead Horse State Park are much more awe-inspiring. Just to be clear we only visited the Islands in the Sky section of the park. This basically is a two hour drive or so that takes you to different viewpoints throughout the northern end of the park. Each viewpoint has a parking area and trail area to hike around. There is a small visitors center near the entrance to the park. Quite smaller than the visitors center at Arches. I don't know anything about the other three sections of Canyonlands.So here's my advice. If your short on time, go to Dead Horse State Park and skip this section of Canyonlands.

A day for each part is good for a family if you are willing to do the short hikes (about 1 mile or less) and skip the long ones. We especially liked the Whale Rock and Cave Springs hikes.Take plenty of water if you hike during the summer, even on the short hikes.","June 22, 2016",A little bit of everything,2,,5

This park is huge and the scenery is very different than you will see at Arches, even though it is only 30 minutes away. The park is huge and you would need days to see it all. We stuck around the Island in the Sky district as it is the closest to Moab and hiked the Grand View Point Trail. It was an easy trail, physically speaking but the views were stunning well worth the trip. It is a relatively uncrowded trail and mostly level, but there is little shade available. Bring lots of water and sunscreen.","June 19, 2016",Amazing views near Moab,19,"Madison, Wisconsin",5
Canyonlands National Park,just a wonderful way to spend the day. The kie along the Grand View was breath taking. The earlier you start the better. Once the crowd comes in it can get a little crowded. however most people don't go all the way to the end of the trial so that is a relief. We had a wonderful time here. We escaped the crowds of Arches and found unsurpassed unspoiled beauty. Try the Needles section of the park too.

Canyonlands National Park,"Seems like this park is a bit more hiker friendly than Arches- at least for those who aren't super experienced. I was hiking solo so I did 4 short hikes- 7.9 miles. Murphy Point is great- you start out in a meadow and then it changes. Grand View Point is fabulous- walk along the rim for 1 mile. You can see most of the park in one day, that is if you are doing just short hikes. The trails are well marked, lots of out houses. No water. This is a park you can do alone. Quite different from Arches - totally worth a visit.","June 15, 2016",Murphy Point is the best,21,atlanta,5
Canyonlands National Park,"This park is about 20 miles off the main road or a half hour. It is much less crowded. At the time we visited on Memorial Day weekend, the line to get into Arches was about 2 miles long or about an hour. We opted for Canyonlands instead where we were behind 3 cars here so 5 minutes. We were starving, but there are no food services in the park, just trail mix and energy bars at the visitor center. I think I liked the Shafer canyon viewpoint the best but the short path there is rocky amd uneven. We did all the viewpoints in the Island in the Sky section but skipped the Needles section which is further south and about 30 miles inland. The island in the sky section took about 3 hours to visit all the viewpoints and a ranger talk but we did not hike as I was in a walking boot for a broken foot. The scenery consists of beautiful vistas of buttes and the River. Really a beautiful park but further out of the way.

Plenty of trails are available for those can walk strenuous trails 6 – 22 miles in length; for those who prefer easy to moderate trails, check out Mesa Arch, Grand View Point, White Rim Overlook, Upheaval Dome, and Aztec Butte. For a half-day visit, don’t miss Grand View Point, Mesa Arch, and the viewpoints. Pack a lunch with you and make use of one of the two picnic areas. (No services are available at the park.) We ate at the Grand View picnic area and then enjoyed the views along the White Rim Overlook trail. If you can arrive before sunrise, catch the early light on the underside of Mesa Arch; otherwise, visit Mesa Arch in the late afternoon when the sun shines full on the arch.

There are some places where you can walk easy paths to see specific points of interest - but Canyonlands is mostly a driving tour experience. Plenty of overlooks to stop at and take pictures. This park is known as a ""Dark Site"" park - which means when the sun goes down, the starts come out without interference from city lights. We stayed one night until 11PM so that we could shoot the ""Milky Way"" and the constellations - however, too much cloud coverage prevented us from seeing anything memorable.

Canyonlands National Park,"We went to Arches first, which was spectacular. Canyonlands is delightful in its own right. It doesn't have the red-rock arches but it does have quite a few canyons and look-outs. It appears to me that Canyonlands is larger and more spread out. We only visited the northern part of the park. The other two areas are accessible through separate roads that are not nearby. Our favorite part of the visit was the day that we hiked Neck Spring trail. It was a 6 mile loop through a canyon. We only encountered 4 other groups of hikers - a relief after the throngs of people at The Arches. The trail is well-marked and provides a variety of terrain. Be prepared for elevation gains and a rock scramble that's around the half-way point of the hike. It took us about 3.5 hours to complete the hike, but we were walking slowly and stopped to eat our lunch. The next day we drove through the park and stopped at most of the major overlooks. My favorite was the Grand View Overlook. Definitely a must-see. ","May 30, 2016",Best Hike of Our Trip,254,"Northampton, Massachusetts",5

However it is the best way to get to know the incredible landscape, and skip the crowds for a short while.

Canyonlands National Park,"In the Canyonlands National Park we drove the main roads of the Island in the Sky District and did not go into the dirt roads of the backcountry trails. Our first stop was the Shafer Canyon Overlook and from that vantage point the views were absolutely spectacular. You should definitely stop here. You get magnificent views of the Colorado River Canyon, the dirt Shafer Road Trail, and the surrounding vistas.Our first hike in Canyonlands National Park was the Mesa Arch Hike. This is a short and easy hike to a magnificent rock arch which hangs on the edge of a cliff and through the archway your views into the canyons are spectacular. This is a must do hike in Canyonlands.Our second hike in Canyonlands National Park was the Upheaval Dome Hike. As we drove the paved park road towards the Upheaval Dome site, we kept looking for a dome, but saw none. The site is actually more of a depression or huge pit in the landscape and it is only visible once you take the hike. We went to the second overlook point which made it a moderately difficult hike of 2 miles round trip. The hike includes a combination of sand and gravel trail combined with some slick rock open areas. It was a good hike, great exercise and the view of this unusual geologic feature was well worth the journey.Our third hike of the day in Canyonlands National Park was the Grand View Point Hike. This is an absolute not to be missed hike that runs along the canyon edge at the end point of the Island in the Sky mesa, and affords constant panoramic views of the deep canyons below. This is an easy and level hike (2 miles roundtrip) that allows one to view the two magnificent canyons formed over hundreds of thousands of years by the Green River and the Colorado River.

Canyonlands National Park,"We visited both Island in the Sky and Needles. Island in the Sky was fantastic with beautiful views and fun hikes. Our kids (ages 11 and 9) really enjoyed it. Needles was not worth the drive in my opinion. We were staying in Moab so it was a longer drive to get to the Needles district. They have very limited parking at all of the trailheads. To do the most popular hike to Chesler Park you need to drive down a 3 mile dirt road that only fits one vehicle at a time. We drive a dually truck so it was difficult to get out of the way when another car came up the road. Once we finally made it to the Chesler Park trailhead there was no available parking. There is also a picnic area at that trailhead, but we only saw 1 picnic table. For the most popular trail in the park I would think they would make a better road to get in there and have more adequate parking and picnic tables. So basically driving down that narrow dirt road was a waste of time. We did a couple of other hikes in the park but they weren't that great. Overall the Needles district was a bit disappointing.

At the Visitor Center I recommend the newly published Island in the Sky Road Guide for Canyonlands along your drive. Stops along the way have good paths to view the wonders of Canyonlands, difficult to describe and panoramas best seen with the naked eye rather than photographs. What a variety of rock colors: red, orange, yellow, rusty-brown, white, gray. Utah juniper trees abound and many of the old twisted trunks and branches serve as guard rails along the road. You'll see ravens, too. If you look carefully, you'll see the Colorado River and Green River flowing among the rocks.

Canyonlands National Park,"This review is based strictly on the Island in the Sky section of the park. I did not visit The Needles or The Maze. As part of a trip across Utah, I visited Arches, Zion, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef, and Canyonlands. Canyonlands was the least impressive of the 5. Mesa Arch and the Grand View are the best aspects of the park. These are quick canyon viewpoints that do have spectacular views, yes, but there are better views in Utah including the neighboring Dead Horse State Park. The rest of the park is pretty drab. It's basically flat desert land with no hiking opportunities. I wouldn't be too upset if you can't fit it into your schedule and would recommend more time at Arches instead. Maybe you could see the sunrise at Mesa Arch then spend the rest of the day at Arches.","May 10, 2016",The Least of the Big 5,465,"New Orleans, Louisiana",3
Canyonlands National Park,"We actually spent two days at Canyonlands compared to one day at Moab. It is further from Moab (about 30 miles) than Arches which is only 4 miles away. Unfortunately the weather was often inclement during both days of our visit. When we were at Grand View Overlook, we experienced rain, sleet, and pebble-sized hail at its 6,080 feet altitude. We spent 20 minutes waiting out the weather and were able to do the 2 mile roundtrip Grand View Overlook trail, encountering occasional rain along the way. We knew that the weather forecast was going to be cool and rainy so we were dressed appropriately. It's important to wear good hiking shoes (ours were waterproof as well). Despite the weather the views were truly awe-inspiring.Travelers should remember to bring there own water and food as there is none in the park.

The crowds vanish away from the main viewpoints, and on a seven hour hike down the Murphy Trail from the rim out to the jeep road, I met only six other hikers, and most of the time I felt as though I had the whole amazing canyon to myself. The White Rim jeep road may be one of the most spectacular four wheel drive routes in the US.

On my first day I had one chance to go down the road to the Grand View Point was the farthest point that section. And the next day I take the time to go to the Green River Overlook and the Mesa Arch. Consider 30 minutes or less of your time to visit the Visitor Center. Carry water with you although the attractions of this park are near the road and do not need to walk much. If you see a sign that says Shafer Canyon Overlook park your car and contemplate a spectacular view.

I started with the Mesa Arch hike, then did the hike to the end of the Grand View Point. Both stunning hikes. I wanted to have time for the Whale Tail, but opted to do the Upheaval instead, which I also recommend. Lots of short hikes to fill a day (or longer if you prefer not to have breaks inbetween).

This drive will take you to breathtaking views of the conyonlands and to a viewpoint used in the movie 'Thelma & Louise"" where they drove off into the canyon.

Canyonlands National Park,"Our visit to Canyonlands National Park coincided with our visit to Arches National Park. You can enter Canyonlands about 30 miles from Arches. Canyonlands is comprised of four districts, the Island in the Sky, the Needles, the Maze and the Rivers. You cannot get to another district within the park. There are no roads connecting them. The Island in the Sky is the closest to Arches and that is why we chose to visit it. This park offers amazing canyon vistas. The contrast of the canyons with the back ground of the mountains makes for a spectacular visit. This place is quiet except for the people and cars but, get to a place where you are alone, and the peace just flows into you. This is a very easy park to navigate as there is only one road in/out. There are plenty of scenic vistas and there are hiking trails. The highest elevation in the park is 6000+ feet and on the particular day that we were there it was CRAZY windy! If you do any hiking be sure to have ample water. Please obey signs that say NO CLIMBING. These signs are there for your safety and the respect for preserving the National Park for future visitors. We had to walk away from some area because people were disregarding the NO CLIMBING signs and clearly were making me very nervous and uncomfortable. If you fall, IT'S A LONG HARD FALL. The USA has preserved the National Park areas for all of us to enjoy and appreciate. How we treat them and how we leave them will either ensure that they will be there for generations or will be destroyed by disrespect.","March 30, 2016",Support the National Parks,90,,5

Island in the Sky has multiple viewpoints not far from turnoffs, but you'll want to do some hiking to really take in the beauty. Needles is well worth a visit, but besides the 1 1/2 hr drive from Moab (the last hour is beautiful), it will require considerable effort to get up close to the needles.

Canyonlands National Park,"We had a hard time figuring out where to enter because the park has several entrances and different levels of accessibility. Both visitor centers were not open yet for the season. We did visit two areas. The entrance 60 miles south of Moab goes through a Native American recreation area that has great views. There are several hiking trails in the park with interesting artifacts. Then we went to the park entrance 9 miles north of Moab. This is high Mesa. We watched the sunset there. Even though the visitor centers were closed, the weather was perfect and there were very few others there.","March 3, 2016",Huge area,0,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5
Canyonlands National Park,"Canyonlands is a large park. There are basically 3 regions. The one most easily accessible is off Highway 313 near Moab - Island in the Sky, this review only covers this region. The Maze and the Needles will be future trips to the area. There are all sorts of interesting things to see here. It's interesting to see how the wind and water shaped the buttes and canyons of this land. If you are a geology buff, you'll enjoy it. Upheaval Dome is quite unique.Perhaps second only to Delicate Arch, Mesa Arch is one of the most iconic places in Utah and indeed the entire southwest. There is a short hike up to it. It's quite a view of the Arch and the steep, dramatic drop off into the Colorado River canyon beyond. Photo opportunities abound. ","February 27, 2016",Mesa Arch and the great void...!,52,ks,4

Canyonlands National Park,"Depending on what you prefer you will have to make a choice when visiting Canyonlands. The Needles district is about an hour's drive or more away from Moab and the fun there is a series of simple trails that take you to an ancient granary, an old cowboy camp, and some pretty views. The more stunning photo ops are found at the Island in the Sky district and considerably closer to Moab. Either way both are lovely but Arches remains my favorite in that area.","February 24, 2016",Beautiful but hard to do the whole park in one day,58,"Park City, Utah",4
Canyonlands National Park,"Actually 3 districts divided by the Colorado and Green Rivers, each is unique. I most recently visited Island in the Sky district which is home to Mesa Arch. Mesa arch is one of the photographic icons in the Southwest, and to photograph it at sunrise, be prepared to be shoulder to shoulder with other photographers trying to get the same shot (my experience one May). I went back this February and the temperature was a relatively 'balmy' 34 degrees (you're at 6000 feet elevation), the crowds were nonexistent, still a dozen people coming and going, very low key that day. I'm not sure I would feel comfortable with small children there- the arch overhangs a cliff face and it is approximately 700 feet straight down. headlamps or flashlights a must to find the arch and for safety, the trail is well marked and easily hiked. Several other good view points. If you are up for a vigorous hike, Upheaval Dome but would recommend spring or fall, a long rigorous hike and very hot in summer.

Canyonlands National Park,"went here a couple of weekends ago. I was going to visit both Arches and Canyonlands, but Arches was PACKED... Very busy weekend in Moab. So I drove up to Canyonlands, and literally, had the place to myself. There were no Rangers at the booths to pay (no fee). That was great... The visitors' center was closed for the winter, but there were people eating their lunches at the picnic tables. It was a beautiful day, and the park was so QUIET... Hardly any cars there as I was driving around viewing the sites. There was still a little snow on the ground, but the viewing points had 4 or 5 cars parked there. Was absolutely great.There were people camping ---- Loved the photo ops and the views are spectacular. It is a large park, and there is a lot of driving. The highway is also a spot for ranch-free cattle roaming, so be careful driving. I got stuck behind a few cow crossing the road. Great photos... It is an amazing place... If you are planning on visiting Moab, do not by-pass this park. Less crowds than Arches, and you can only see this stuff once in your life...","February 22, 2016",...nice to visit in the off-season...,239,Colorado,5

Canyonlands National Park,"After getting oriented at the Visitors Center, we went to Mesa Arch. We had to hike in a 1/4 mile or so and all of a sudden there you are facing this arch that was, say 20 feet to the top with about a 15 foot opening and about 30 feet wide. Now, the arches in Arches National Park “prepared” you but nothing warned you for what you were had just stumbled upon. You walk up to this opening and you can see right through it and you are looking at the other side of the canyon several miles away. And when you reach the opening itself, hold on, it is an immediate drop of 2000 feet – straight down. It is literally breathtaking. Of all the arches, this was the best. Off to Grand View Point. Named so because from here you can see the Colorado River. Before the turn of the century or some such time, this part of the Colorado River (north of the Green River and Colorado River fork) was known as the Grand River, hence the name. From here you could see for miles and miles and miles (Colorado was on the horizon), and again a 2000-foot drop. The signs everywhere said to “stay on the path or die”. No politically correct (PC) statements here like you would find in the East. Just plain simple truth. Then to Upheaval Dome. After parking, you hike again for a half-mile up a steep hill and you arrive at a point looking down on a crater filled with salt. Two theories, the first and most unlikely is that it is a salt deposit that had pushed itself to the surface and become exposed. This I do not buy into because, if this were the case, I would expect more of them. The other theory is that it is a meteor crater. We spent an hour walking along the edge of the thing – it is altogether a mile in diameter – where you walk on poorly defined paths, that were marked with little rock piles, “cairns.”","February 18, 2016",stay on the path or die,163,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5

Canyonlands National Park,The short half mile hike out to Mesa Arch in Canyonlands NP can be a little trickier in the winter with the snow and slush covering the trail. Once you arrive for the magnificent view it is well worth it. The trail is well defined and well marked and is suitable for children. Good shoes though are recommended as the trail can be quite slick in spots and there are occasional frozen pools of water to avoid. The snow cover definitely adds to the beauty of the surroundings.,"February 16, 2016",Beautiful Mesa Arch Awaits following a short hike thru the snow,284,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5

Well worth the walk to Mesa Arch, Upheaval Dome and Green River Lookout. It can be slippery along the trail if you don't have good grip on your shoes. The walk to Grand View was a bit disappointing as it really was no better than Green river view. It was pretty but I had a grumbling teenager that needed something special at the end to make it worth while. You get a better view of the meandering river at Dead Horse State Park (not a NP and $10 to enter). The White rim road and Schiffer? trail are closed in Winter. You can see where they go from various viewpoints. The road would have a great view into the river canyon and would have the cliff of the ""island"" on the other side.

Canyonlands National Park,I am going to have to 100% agree with one of the previous reviewers that this has some of the most incredible views you can see.

The park is divided into three sections because of the Colorado and Green rivers which flow through it. Plan your visit carefully based on the section you would be most interested in seeing.

The viewing spots do provide the "" spectacular"" that people expect . The canyons are absolutely fabulous, the colors are amazing , and we spent a long time just looking and enjoying . The other two districts are the Maze, on the western side, but it requires a 4 wheel drive vehicle, so we did not get to enjoy it . We did go to Needles, the southern most district . It is about an hour drive from Moab , and quite honestly , we enjoyed the drive into the Park more than the actual Park . There is a campground in the district if you choose to do that . On our way into Needles District we stopped at Newspaper Rock . It has petroglyphs that are interesting to see . We would likely not repeat this district again , there are equally beautiful spots and areas closer to Moab . ","November 28, 2015",Fabulous !,146,Northern Ontario,5
Canyonlands National Park,We visited several of the overlooks in the Island in the Sky district of this truly amazing National Park. Make sure you bring water with you since there is no water beyond the visitor's center. ,"November 28, 2015",Memorable Thanksgiving at Canyonlands,140,"Richmond, VA, USA",5
Canyonlands National Park,"We drove from the highway to the Island in the Sky Visitor Centre for our tickets. Across the road is the first stop to see Schafer Canyon. Keep travelling and visit Mesa Arch. It is a good walk from the carpark but well worth it. The view through it is amazing.We also hiked up to Upheaval Dome and although uphill just take it slow and you will be thrilled at the top. We also walked to the second viewpoint and enjoyed views from another angle. Green River Outlook is close to the carpark and lots of photos will be taken here too. There is a camp grounds nearby for those willing to rough it. Buck Outlook and Grand View Outlook are also a must to view. A stop at Newspaper Rock is worth a short walk for a photo.You really need a whole day to see the whole park as it is divided into a couple of sections. Unfortunately we could only see The Needles from a distance so needed more time. Next time. It was all beautiful and amazing and full of wonder!!Take water, a camera and wear good tough walking shoes.","November 22, 2015",Brilliant. Don't miss this!,61,"Coral Cove, Australia",5
