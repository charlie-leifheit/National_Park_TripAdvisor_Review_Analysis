Everglades National Park,"I have occasionally visited Everglades National Park over the past 40 years, but it has been over two decades since I last visited. The location is as impressive as ever, but it is obvious that there has been little maintenance in the past few years. The available facilities are run-down, impacting the visitor experience, and with potential safety issues. As an example, the Gumbo Limbo trail at Royal Palm is impassable to all but able-bodied visitors, with small trees down across the trail, an overgrown and bumpy path, and the need to duck under low limbs and blow-down. Similar overgrown conditions exist at other trails in the Park, Unfortunately, the Park website lists several trails in the Flamingo area that are simply not maintained any longer.Don't arrive at Flamingo at the end of the Everglades National Park access road from Homestead/Florida City expecting to find a restaurant, as there is none. The original main visitor center is closed, and is supposedly being renovated, but is not expected to be open for 2-3 years. There is a small temporary Visitor Center at Flamingo, but it is not regularly staffed during off-season months. There are air-conditioned portable bathrooms at this location. A small store has some snack items, drinks, and other items.Do visit the park, as it is important that everyone understand the crucial function of Lake Okeechobee and the Everglades in maintaining fresh water in south Florida, and how it supports the sea life in Florida Bay and beyond. Bring your own food, water, bug spray, and sunscreen.I hope things improve here. There were a decent number of visitors for the off-season, when it is less likely to see wildlife. There were a good number of boaters and fishermen using the Flamingo launch.Caution - at several locations, including Royal Palm and Flamingo, flocks of black vultures patrol the parking lots, and have developed an affinity to pick at and rip apart the rubber and plastic of windshield wipers and weatherstripping, which we witnessed. There are tarps available at Royal Palm to cover your car, and visitors might want to bring their own to avoid damage.","October 13, 2019","Great location, but no maintenance",46,"Westchester County, New York",2
Everglades National Park,"All National Parks are a must see when visiting any geographic area. Everglades National Park is just minutes from Florida City, Fl, last stop before heading in the the Florida Keys. Everglades National Park is just a short drive west and with minutes you will be in the middle of the Everglades. Great hike at Royal Palm stop - the Anhinga Trail - camera ready and eyes open - alligators are not fenced in and walk freely. From tiny spiders, snakes, fish and tons of birds - catch the park ranger walking tour if you can.Before leaving this area - check out the Nike Missile Silo - yes old war missiles were located in the Everglades pointed at Cuba.If you are really into adventure - keep heading south to Flamingo - most southern location in the US - not an island. Lots of side trails on the way.On the way back to US 1 - stop at Robert Is Here Fruit Stand - GET A MILKSHAKE!! Strawberry - Key Lime is my favorite.","October 9, 2019",A Hidden National Park - Do Miss It,12,"Austin, Texas",5
Everglades National Park,"Came to south Florida to see the glades and Big Cypress. I was disappointed in the park overall as it seems the park service is not investing money in repairing the damage caused in recent years from hurricanes. There were many trails that were blocked by debris. Some boardwalks damaged beyond repair. We drove all the way to Flamingo and saw about 20 other people. I know it was off season but I wasn’t expecting this. There is a huge park center there surrounded by chain link fence. Hurricane damage years old still not repaired. On the good side we saw a few alligators, birds and other wildlife. ","September 24, 2019",Visit to the Everglades ,20,"Grantville, Pennsylvania",3
Everglades National Park,We went on both sides of the park. Such different terrain and so much to see! Such informational folks that go the extra mile to ensure you have a great experience! Add this one to your bucket list! It is my understanding that you will see lots more “animals” in the dry season! We’ve seen enough during the wet season to make it totally worth while!,"September 19, 2019",Great National Park!!!,3,"Montgomery, Texas",5
Everglades National Park,"We went in August, and it was extremely hot. We came in through the Ernest Coe Visitor Center and went to hikes along that route. Needless to say, we didn't see much except some birds. No alligators. Probably too hot as we were there midday. There are tons of mosquitoes; even with repellent we were eaten up. I've read it's better to take a boat tour of the park as most of it is water. If I ever go back, that's what I would do. The entrance fee is $30 but I have a park pass which we we used to get in.","September 1, 2019",Take a boat tour,34,"Louisville, Kentucky",4
Everglades National Park,"Few Americans come to visit. Why? We don’t know why. We talked to many visiting Brits and Germans. The Park Rangers told us they agreed. Americans don’t take advantage of this great national Park. In fact they have tours led in German! Yes, here you only see the noses of the Manatees coming up to breathe. At Disney’s Epcot you can see them swimming under water. However, We saw so many alligators including an alligator chasing and killing another smaller alligator. This alligator drowned his victim, carried it in his mouth took it to the bank and began chomping. We were totally fascinated. Use your National Parks, Americans!!!!","August 30, 2019",Few Americans. Many Europeans Come Here,201,"Tipp City, Ohio",5
Everglades National Park,Went back in November 2015 after the rain had stopped for the day. Pulled into one of the parking areas and walked the trails that were offered there. This is what we saw. I will make it back again some day soon and venture into more areas of the park.,"August 23, 2019",Nature Walk,4,"Palm Coast, Florida",5
Everglades National Park,The two best areas to visit are Flamingo and Shark Valley Visitors Centers.Flamingo has a wonderful sunset cruise for $35 a person. You see great birds and wildlife. By the dock there is a family of manatees. There is an area where the alligators do a mating dance. Food is available but after mile 15 I had no cell phone service.Shark Valley Visitors Center has a great tram ride to see all the animals but you can also do the bike ride. The tram ride is about $20 a person.Parking lot can be really full so try to get there early in the day. We arrived at 10:30pm and was one of the last three in.,"August 19, 2019",Lots to do at ,19,"Wuhan, China",5
Everglades National Park,"The park offers a nature walk that departs from the Royal Palm visitor center (further into the park than the Ernest F Coe visitor center. The walk is on the Anhinga Trail. The trail is actually a boardwalk. The park ranger walks most of it with the group (which just casually assembles at the start time at the Royal Palm center) and discusses the many interesting things about the park and its history. We happen to see many alligators during our time as well as turtles, fish, and birds. The rangers are very knowledgeable and I think it is worth it to do the walk with them. You can also drive the 38 miles to Flamingo. We did it, and if this will be your only time at the park do it... however on our next trip to the park, we probably won't go there. It's worth it if you are going to take a boat ride. The visitor center there is a trailer as the actual visit center is under construction from hurricane damage. The other advantage to driving further into the park is all the side trails you can hike. They aren't long, but it's still worth exploring. The Nike Missile site was closed when we were there, so I cannot comment on that aspect.The park is very large and you cannot reach Shark Valley through the main park entrance. You have to go north to Rt 41/8th Street and head West. It is at least an hour from the Ernest Coe visitor center to the Shark Valley visitor center. However, if you head out to Shark Valley, you will come upon the Miccosukee Indian Village which is nearby. This also puts you in the Big Cypress National Forest so you can go to that visitor center as well for National Park Passport stamp cancellations (yes, we are those people). This area is also where some air boat rides take off from that also have alligator demonstrations (we went to two different ones a few years ago, I recommend Wooten's- take the swamp buggy... good history, you're in Big Cypress and we even saw a black bear). We live nearby so we are fortunate we can explore often. However, I'd recommend at least 2 days at the park so you can really see and appreciate how large it is, as well as see the different parts.","August 9, 2019",Large park worth staying more than a day,30,United States,5
Everglades National Park,"7/30/2019 - Our family stopped at the Everglades National Park’s Gulf Coast Visitor Center looking for suggestions about how we might best experience the everglades. Not only did we get some very helpful visitor info, but Ranger Jacob(?) Trusty did an awesome job of teaching our 3 grandsons (4, 8, and 10 years) some important facts about the area and the wildlife that inhabits it. He educated us all with a very entertaining style that kept the kids’ attention and left us all richer for the experience.","August 8, 2019",Great way to get started,10,"Louisville, KY",5
Everglades National Park,"The Ernest Coe Visitor Center has a good introductory movie and displays. Junior Rangers can get and complete booklets here. Apply insect repellent wherever you go outside, but especially to Mahogany Hammock trail.Another good trail--with fewer mosquitos--is Royal Palms. The newly-constructed pathways are very good. See alligators here.IF short on time, don't bother going to Flamingo. The Visitor Center is only infrequently and irregularly open. Not much at the dock unless you are boating.The environment of the Everglades is very special and a realization of the grasses and water and creatures is possible by the displays and walking the trails.","August 5, 2019",Apply insect repellent and enjoy,548,"Dallas, Texas",5
Everglades National Park,"This national park should be a ""must-see"" on everyone's list. Possibly, along with Yellowstone, it is the most unique park in America. The landscape and wildlife capture your attention and you will be amazed at the vastness of this park. Be prepared to drive, but be sure to stop at the many visitor's centers. Each one offers a different prospective of the park. Of course the best way to see nature's incredible work is to walk the boardwalks leading out into the Everglades. Or, better yet, take one of the air boat tours to get a first hand glimpse of the marshy wetlands. You are sure to see alligators, birds, and other creatures lurking in the water and air. One day here is not enough. Plan to spend at least two days if you want the experience the park and all it has to offer.","August 4, 2019",One of the most unique national parks in America,44,"Easton, Pennsylvania",5
Everglades National Park,"My wife, 14 year old son and I visited the Everglades on route to key west in July.I booked prior to the holiday via ‘get your guide Everglades national park airboat tour and wildlife show’. It’s an hours tour in a shared airboat and cost approx $25 each. Take your printed ticket with you. That also gets you a short wildlife talk after the boat ride.The tour itself was very informative. We had a really nice young guide who was very enthusiastic about his job.We were lucky and saw some gators, but depends like all nature, on the time of year you go as to what wildlife you see.Well worth a detour to go and see.","August 1, 2019",Fantastic. A must,15,"Buochs, Switzerland",5
Everglades National Park,"Everglades National Park offers a lot of diversity. We arrived at the Park Headquarters around 9:45am. While at the Visitor Center, we noticed that there was a Ranger led walk at the Royal Palm Anhinga Trail at 10:30am. That is the place to see Alligators according to websites. We got there and the Ranger lead the the walk around the swamp area which is 7/10 mile long & takes less than an hour. It is on paved trail and on an over the water bridge. The Ranger said she hoped to see 3 gators since it was summer and gators are staying cool in vegetation. We saw 6 gators, amazing. We then went on to other sites, Pa-Hey-okee overlook, Mahogany Hammock, and to the end of the road, Flamingo. We saw Manatees at the boat dock at Flamingo.","July 24, 2019","Alligators, Mantees, birds, trails",101,"Tucson, AZ",5

Everglades National Park,"We've been camping in Everglades National Park since around 1970 as a family when I was in middle school. Most of us kids have continued to return here every few years in the winter. While the park is beautiful - for those who look closely and know what to look for - it can be expensive for families to camp there. Like many National Parks, there are little to no facilities, though they finally added some solar showers at Long Pine Key campground. Still, they are now forcing you to pay through the nose and must reserve well in advance. Often they claim the campground is full even when the onsite situation may be very different. It's a scam. Half our camping fees now go to private companies that are barely functional. Sad. The park and wild life continue to rebound after horrible hurricanes, much as the natural world does. It just takes time. You won't be impressed by massive vistas like parks out west. That's not what the Everglades is about. It's about the micro, it's about intertwined flora and fauna. It's about amazing creation that has been placed here as a reminder of the Creator.Be sure to visit:the visitor center, Royal Palm Visitor Center (Anhinga Trail, Gumbo Limbo Trail_, Pa-hay-okee, Mahogany Hammock, West Lake Trail, and Flamingo Visitor Center.","June 21, 2019",Classic National Park - with expensive federal camping,5,,4
Everglades National Park,"Spent two day devoted just to this park. Walked several of the short trails and took tours on excursion boat, trams and a fan boat just outside the park.

Everglades National Park,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit here. It was a Thursday and things were very quiet, so much so that we were generally the only car on the road. We entered via the Ernest F Coe visitor centre on the 9336 out of Florida City where, having received a thorough briefing at the Coe visitor centre, we headed to the main gate where we paid the entry fee of $30. There are numerous areas where you can park up and hike but with the temperature at 90+ we had to be selective. The Anhinga Trail at the Royal Palm visitor centre is superb. Walking is easy on made paths around a wetland area and we saw 3 alligators, turtles, terrapins and lots of different fish. The adjacent Gumbo Limbo trail through woods is also enjoyable although less dramatic (but look out for the frogs!!). At the end of the road (about a 45 minute drive) is the Flamingo visitor centre and if you continue just past to the camping area the sea views are spectacular. At Flamingo we took the 90 minute boat trip but I’m sure I can recommend it. The trip follows the Buttonwood canal through Coot Bay to Bear Lake and although the scenery is lovely we didn’t see any significant wildlife other than a couple of herons. At $35 per person I have to say we were left disappointed and, having seen gators for free on the Anhinga Trail, feeling that w should have saved our money.","June 6, 2019",Wonderful nature,385,"Southampton, United Kingdom",5

For a birder, there are so many varieties that you'll never exhaust the opportunities; hundreds of animal species that will leave you speechless.The air-boat ride is so much fun just skimming the water but my favourite will always be by the bank looking at a bird and then seeing an alligator with his mouth wide open just feet away.So many sights, so many memories - it has to be one of the best national parks in the world.","May 14, 2019",Absolutely stunning,2669,"Sydney, Australia",5

On the second day we did a Ranger guided walk at Royal Palms and Anhinga trail and saw beautiful Anhingas drying their wings near Coe Visitors Center, drove out Flamingo Visitors Center to see Manatees swimming about in the Marina, and then to Shark Valley Visitors Center and lucked out seeing baby Alligators. Second day was a long day in the car. Recommend breaking out Shark Valley as a day activity.

When we visited, there was not a restaurant in Flamingo. It looks like it may be opening with in the next few months to a year.

Everglades National Park,"Everyone should come spend a few days in Everglades, but come in the winter or spring. Unlike other national parks which have awe-inspiring, breathtaking vistas, this park is all about water. Listen to a ranger explain the process of slow filtration as this water passes ever so slowly from north to south, dropping only inches, and you will appreciate its vital role. The wildlife is abundant and beautiful, even the alligators and crocs, which exist together here, the only place in the world where it happens. There are opportunities for boat rides: airboats, kayaks, tourist boats, and private boating from yacht basins along the ocean. There are short and long trails, and a tram ride in the northern section. It was not buggy in early April, but bring bug repellant if you come any later.

Everglades National Park,"Florida has three national parks and Everglades is the largest. From the east entrance of the park to the southern tip where Flamingo City is located is about 38 miles. This is one of the most important biological parks on this planet as it has some of the unique wildlife only to this place and nowhere else in the world. Countless birds, mammals, reptiles, fish of many kinds, etc, not to mentioned seas of trees of hug and small. You can easily spend a week here, even that you may only be able to cover the surface of the park. Famous Anhinga Trail will provide you with some wonderful opportunities to see many birds of Florida native, of course, you will see some gators simply resting on the side of the walking path as if they own this place (perhaps they do own this place as they have been occupying this land for millions of years before us). In Flamingo City you will have an opportunity to take a boat ride to see even more wildlife in Florida Bay. Here you will see Florida Crocodiles and Florida alligators coexist, only place on earth can you see this all at one place. If you would like to have some refreshments, and lunch, you may get them in the gift shop here as well. Everglades National Park is a treasure to all human kind and it is a true pleasure to see it. There is an entrance fee to the park. However, if you have the Golden Pass, a pass one can purchase if you are a citizen of US and 62+ of age, you will be able to use the pass and get into the park without additional fees.","April 7, 2019",The largest national park in Florida,18,"Pompano Beach, Florida",5
Everglades National Park,"I have recently done a series of activities in the Everglades National Park. The first day I went in from Florida City, and started at the very impressive visitors' centre. I then a few miles down the road walked round the Anhinga board walk, which, even for someone who knows as little about birds as I do, is a superb experience of bird watching, alligators, turtles, and waterways. I then drove down to Flamingo, walked a little way along the coast, watched the manatee, and then had a boat ride through the mangroves, during which I saw crocodiles, amongst other creatures. I stopped at various hammocks and board walks on the way back. The second day I drove along US41 and, firstly, enjoyed an airboat ride, which again is very good for seeing the wild life, the mangrove, and getting a real sense of the vastness of this grassland cum slow-moving waterway. Later that day I went in at the Shark Valley entrance and hired a bike. I do not think much of the bikes on offer, but cycling about fifteen miles there is an excellent way of observing the birds and the waterways, and especially getting a sense of the sounds amidst what is otherwise silence.","March 31, 2019",Superb experience of nature,23,"Chichester, United Kingdom",5

Everglades National Park,"This is our second trip to the Everglades. We entered at the entrance closest to Homestead. We do recommend watching the National Park movie at the visitor center, as well as, exploring the center itself. The rangers all offer useful information. There are guided tours available, which I highly recommend. Another option is to enter at the Shark Valley location. Here you have the opportunity of taking a tram deeper into the park. One tip - Book Early.Both entrances provide great viewing of alligators and birds, more at the Shark Valley location. One note, the Park information does not provide enough information as tl the devastation to wild life, that the Burmese pythons have caused, now numbering into the thousands, Many believe that almost all mammals have disappeared from the Everglades, Note, they are almost impossible to see. These creatures have now been spotted in states north of Florida, with no natural predators. The Everglades is still a great place to visit, albeit the man made problem of these snakes without a current solution.","March 28, 2019",Our Everglades National Park Experience,8,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",5
Everglades National Park,"OK, it ain't the Rockies or Yellowstone, but there is a lot of beauty here and it is one-of-a-kind. Anhinga Trail - loaded with gators & birds. Shark Valley - glades, birds, crocs, turtles, a tower with vistas. Take a classic airboat ride thru the glades. Canoe through the mangroves (what an experience!). Walk thru a hammock (forested area). Do a slough slog (wet hike) or any one of several dry hikes. Go to Flamingo Center to boat the bay and walk around eco-pond. Find some high ground (anything above 4 feet) and watch an awesome sunset. Definitely hear a ranger talk.

I highly recommend doing some type of guided tour/activity. We did the all day everglades trip with Garl's Coastal Kayaking and it was amazing. The Anhinga Trail is a really great place to check out (although it can get somewhat crowded). I recommend going here for a day and night hike, as both are really great. We saw lots of wildlife while in the park such as alligators (including babies), manatees, great herons, anhingas, egrets, and so much more! From the homestead entrance its a bout a 40 minutes drive all the way down to Florida Bay/flamingo campground but it is so worth it to explore as much as you can while there! Definitely worth a visit!","March 20, 2019",Amazing place,5,,5

Everglades National Park,"We are avid National Park visitors and the Everglades was a big one on our bucket list - it did not disappoint! It's huge, so we didn't see it all but we had three great experiences: the Anhinga trail, not far from the Ernest Coe visitor center, had tons of wildlife! we saw 15 alligators and numerous fish and birds, not to mention beautiful flora, in an hour's walk! and it's a boardwalk so easy for the handicapped or folks who have trouble walking to navigate. Then we drove down to the Gulf Coast Visitor's center, saw manatees in the marina, and took a boat tour, which was fun. The next day, we took an airboat ride, based out of the northern edge of the park near the Shark Valley visitor center - not to be missed! and then went canoeing down a small river, can't remember the name. There is still wild beauty in our country and this section is not to be missed!","March 20, 2019",Like no other park in the US,38,"Greenwich, Connecticut",5

Worth the 40 minute drive. Lots of wildlife. Crocodile, Manatees,Ospreys and Black Necked Stilts. There is a food truck with excellent sandwiches.

You have the opportunity to see the most diverse wildlife in the park up close. Be aware of Alligators crossing the path and do not approach too closely. The park road gives you the opportunity to pull off and see different eco-systems in the park. Sadly, the National Park system in general is underfunded or neglected, this was reflected in the visitor center at the Anhinga trail and the viewing post at Shark Valley not being in good repair since Irma hit Florida almost 2 years ago.","March 16, 2019",Everglades National Park,14,CENTENNIAL,4

Everglades National Park,"We entered the Everglades from the Homestead entrance but found the National Park signage lacking which led to some confusion in getting there. Going South on SW192nd Ave make a right at the 4 way stop sign onto FL 9336 and follow it 5 miles. It dead ends into the park. We enjoyed the exhibits at the Ernest Coe Visitors Center and spent the day driving through the park to the end at Flamingo, making various stops along the way at the trails and lookouts. Although we had read that services at Flamingo were closed there were temporary services open when we got there (end of February). The Everglades were different than we had envisioned. As February is the dry season, rather than the abysmal swamp we had expected there was grassland, horizon to horizon, with islands of trees and other foliage. Wildlife was abundant and, along with alligators we saw many wading birds amidst the wetlands.

Everglades National Park,"Many travelers do not know that the north entrances to the Everglades mainly feature boat trips. The south entrance, near Florida City and Homestead, feature a long drive to the end with frequent stopping points and walks along the way. The best walk is perhaps the first stop after the entrance (Anhinga), where there is a paved walkway, and several bridge walkways. Most seasons there are dozens or even hundreds of alligators in this area - this year the heavy rainfall kept the animal populations more dispersed in the park. Of course, this walkway tends to have other people. We walked this trail and several others further along into the park. You can spend several hours here or the whole day - there is some food at the end point of the road in Seminole, or bring a picnic.

The facility has some very interesting exhibits and the volunteers provided us with some good tips for our visit. We would recommend walking the Anhinga and Gumbo Limbo Trails at the Royal Palm site (a gem). We also took a boat tour at the Flamingo Marina.

We did see ahingas and other birds, about four adult alligators and two very young ones (just babies, about a foot long), fish and of course the vegetation. We walked the Ahinga Trail, the main boardwalk, and enjoyed the sights, then the other trails too. There's lots of parking if you want to drive yourself.

There is so much to see that you cannot really do it all in one day. We saw a few gators on some of the stops but you really have to look for them. The birds were amazing and we even stumbled upon a nesting area of hundreds of birds on the side of the road. If you're driving through and see a few cars parked off at random places, quietly stop and see what its about.

Everglades National Park,"After visiting a bunch of National Parks like Grand Canyon, Bryce etc. we were in two minds to visit this park as most of the reviews and activities we read about were for kids (ex alligator farms, boat rides etc). However we decided to explore the park considering that it was a national park and there must be something unique. We were pleasantly surprised by the short trails, spotting animals like crocodiles, tortoise and variety of birds. It was just before the start of the tourist season and hence the crowd was relatively less. We enjoyed the silence around the natural surroundings. There was a lot of information around the various trails. Reading and understanding about the flora and fauna of everglades was interesting. We were lucky enough to see a team of wildlife specialist ( appx 25 nos) saving an Injured Manatee. We nearly spent 4 to 5 hours just watching how they managed to capture the Manatee and transported it a Manatee hospital in Miami. It was amazing feel and we understood what effort it takes to just save one animal as large as a Manatee. Our resect for the wildlife specialist really grew 10 folds because we saw them working super hard for that one Manatee. We wanted to give them a hug after they were successful, but didn’t dare to as they looked super exhausted. Luckily a little later when we were at “Robert Is here” we managed to meet the main lady and did give her a hug/congratulations. It was the best part of the Everglades visit for us.

Everglades National Park,"The diversity of plant and animal life is unmatched by anything I've seen. A quick tour barely scratches the surface although a good one such as Shark Valley Tram certainly provides a great overview. I know there are people who go deep into the Glades. I think that would be an experience to rememebr, but I will have to be content with what can be seen from the safety of a tram, boat or car. There were plenty of scary things before idiots starting releasing Burmese and other pythons into the park. Those things are changng the natural order and rival the Alligator for dominance. The tours provide safety and information on a National Park that is recovering from harmful construction and other issues, Evergaldes is something everyone should sample at least once.","October 20, 2018",A place like no other,111,"Pataskala, Ohio",5
Everglades National Park,"Our family loves visiting National Park Sites and so we were very much looking forward to seeing Everglades National Park. Since we were staying on Sanibel Island the Gulf Coast area of the Everglades in Everglades City was the closest part of the park to visit. One thing that is different in this area of the park as opposed to the others is that there is no admission charge. Really there is very little to do and very few services in this area so $25 to visit would be pretty out of line. There are no trails or boardwalks and the visitor center is a temporary trailer building that runs with the help of a generator. A larger (but still temporary trailer) Visitor Center is being built across the parking lot to replace the building that was torn down after receiving severe storm damage from Hurricane Irma.One thing that you can do is take a boat tour of the 10,000 Islands area of the park. There are multiple companies that provide airboat or other boating excursions in and and around the Everglades City area. We chose the concessioner of the National park system who operates a tour that leaves from behind the visitor center. Information can be found on their website which is linked to the NPS site however we found that the times listed online vary from the actual schedule so I would definitely call before booking. Also you have to visit their office to pick up physical tickets which is located across the street from the visitor center area. The tour is 90 minutes long and was an enjoyable trip around the area. There wasn’t as much narration as I expected and after a brief tour of the area it basically became a dolphin chasing excursion. Our daughter loves dolphins so this was fine with us but I could see how other people might be disappointed.The ranger we talked to in the visitor center was extremely nice and engaging and told us all about the park and things going on in and around it. My kids completed the junior ranger program and got a new badge for their efforts. The visitor center doesn’t have much but there is a stamp for NPS passports as well as brochures and maps. We enjoyed our visit to the Gulf Coast area of Everglades National Park and would love to visit the other areas at some point in the future.","October 19, 2018",Gulf Coast Area ,349,"Chattanooga, Tennessee",5

Couple of tips: We entered the park and stopped at the Royal Palm Visitor Center, grabbed some food and maps and asked the rangers for some advice exploring the park. take your time seeing everything because there is so much to see. Wear comfortable clothing and if going in January, light jackets will come in handy. We didnt get to see alligators (besides the ones on the airboat rides) but you will see many other wildlife creatures in their natural habitat. There are sections to sit and have a nice family picnic. Make sure to go the speed limit indicated as there are rangers ready to pull you over.

Having one of the planet’s greatest natural wonders in our backyard affords locals and visitors from around the globe an incredible opportunity to experience wildlife and flora up close. The regal beauty of this “river of grass” is simply awe inspiring. Gators, birds, and the expanse of water and wetlands will amaze even the most jaded traveler. Take an airboat ride out into the wilderness to fully experience the splendor of this unique destination.

That is unless one is also mesmerized by the flat 'river of grass' that stretches for miles and miles. During the migratory seasons, bird life comes into robust activity, though permanently one can still come across alligators and a few permanent resident birds. The bike riding trail at Shark Valley is an interesting way to explore Everglades. The viewing tower at the end of the trail provides an opportunity to be amazed at the vastness of the area.

I entered via the Ernest F. Coe Visitors Center where you can get a map and information as well as supplies such as clothing, insect repellent (a must), drinks etc as well as souvenirs. The closest area after entering the park is the Royal Pines Center where there are two short walks that can be undertaken by people of all ages. This area is also flat and suitable for wheelchairs. The first walk Gumbo Limbo Trail takes a visitor through the trees and grassland whilst the Anhinga Trail takes a visitor around a swamp area. In the swamp are fish, turtles, alligators and bird life. The boardwalk takes you over the water for a closer look. There are seats provided along the way should visitors need a rest. It was an amazing area to see. Driving further west there were two more areas to stop and see: the Pinelands walk described the growth of pine trees in the park and the next stop oversaw the flat sawgrass prairie which was also very interesting and full of birdlife. Unfortunately two thunderstorms then colliding resulting in a heavy downpour which prevented much more exploration. The Flamingo Visitor Center is not always open and the small store there closes at 4.40pm.

If you have time, be sure to learn as much as you can about the history of Florida (which was covered by seawater some 100000 years ago) and the everglades themselves, a place full of peculiar flora and fauna to preserve at all costs. Unfortunately the waters coming from lake Okeechobee are no longer flowing properly in the wet season so we must wait for the government to help the ambient. You can do it by learning something at the Ernest J. Coe visitors centre, or by doing the Anhinga amble guided tour with a ranger (thanks a lot Elizabeth!!). You then can drive toward Flamingo visitors centre, that unfortunately still suffers from the damages taken in 2017 but it's close to where you can spot Manatees and Crocodiles.When or if walking the Anhinga trail alone make sure not to upset the alligators there!!

The place where we went also had food which was nice. We had to wait for boats to come back. We all loaded up in the airboats. The tour guide for our boat gave us some history of the area and the animals and reptiles. And here we go... what an awesome experience when he sped the boat up. I didn’t want him to stop. We slowed down in an area where some alligators were in the water. The tour guide would call them by the names given to them. He would fed them so we could have a better look.

We didn't see any alligators on the tour but since it was the wrong time of the year, but was told that you will see them more in August.

Everglades National Park,"After so many National Parks is in the US, finally I got to Everglades. This park is so unique, so different to the other ones, like a leftover from millenniums ago. We can’t be grateful enough to Ernest F. Coe, who called as the “Father of Everglades N.P.” and who fought for this extraordinary piece of land, to keep it in the original condition, and now we can enjoy this swamp and its residents. The closest visitor center to Homestead was named after him. This is where we started our journey to see as many as possible from the miracles of this magic tropical wetland. Even the drive from the visitor center to Flamingo provides you many interesting sites. It wasn’t the most pleasant experience when we noticed a big flock of vultures on the side of the road, and when we stopped to see, what’s going on, we could see, and unfortunately also smell, a very dead gator, providing lunch for the hungry birds. On the other way, it was interesting to see, how nature works. While providing food for one, in the same way, help to clear away carcasses. Looking at the number of the birds, and the speed, how they stuffed themselves I’m pretty sure, that next day even a trace didn’t remain from the huge gator. When we walked on the broad walks, I could understand the name of Lake Okeechobee. - “River of grass” even if I would instead call it Sea of grass. You look around and mostly can see endless sawgrass marches, with a glimpse of open water here and there. Amazing, how Everglades feed so many animals. Probably the algae are on the bottom of the food chain, and the Florida Panthers are on the top. Or do they share this place with the Gators? While humans won’t interfere, this vast ecosystem works perfectly well.The different trails show you the different faces of Evergreen. Probably the most popular is the Anhinga, named after this bird, that also called Snakebird or Water turkey. The snakebird suits better because of the very long snake-like neck. We have seen several of them diving and coming up with a big fish in the beak. The Pineland trail takes you to an entirely different environment. Less fascinating, but just as important. The Paurotis pond is the nestling-place of many waterbirds. When we were there, two rangers were questioning two fishermen. Probably they were in trouble and caught the more expensive fish in their life. The guards are very active in the park, a car passing by us just got the speeding ticket. Not because we also wouldn’t deserve it, but we were luckier. We had two days for Everglades, but even during two weeks every day it ever would show us newest and newest things.","May 12, 2018",Unique and mesmerizing.,1331,"Sydney, Australia",5

We drove all the way to Flamingo with just a couple of stops on way in. The Flamingo area looks like it was hit hard by Hurricane Irma in Fall 2017. It was pretty desolate. On way back out, late afternoon, we stopped in at Royal Palm and the Anhinga and Gumbo Limbo trails. We're glad we did.

Sun was bright, however, so hats and sunblock were the order of the day. We were traveling with a larger family group that included children, so we did less real trail walking than we usually do. While we were not alone in the park, things never really felt crowded. The birdwatching here is unbelievably good. We were fortunate to have my brother-in-law with us and he is an *extraordinary* bird spotter and helped identify the many, many different kinds of birds we saw.","April 7, 2018",Wild Everglades certainly worth the visit!,202,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5

This time we went through the main entrance down by Florida City and all tge way down to the Flamingo Visitor Center. Many places to stop along the drive, and I highly recommend taking the Anhinga Trail, an easy walk where we saw many alligators, birds, etc. Much of the Flamingo Visitor Center was destroyed by Hurricane Irma so there is no lodging or restaurants there any more, but you can still canoe or kayak there, and the Park Service is in the process of rebuilding the area, including making the buildings hurricane proof.

The flamingo visitor center was damaged by the last hurricane. But the other visitor center was operational. 1st Saturday of March was their heritage day. The founders of this national park was role played by some actors and actresses sharing what happened during the early 1900s. Pretty interesting. There are several walking trails. We were lucky to see lots of alligators, Florida gar, herons, birds, manatee and even a 9 foot long crocodile swimming freely in the wild nature without any restraints. It was amazing to see such animals up close.

The Shark Valley, on the other hand had an abundance of different species and was well Worth the visit. Flamingo, on the other hand, was a disappointment since the only store was closed down and no sandwiches or refreshments were available for sale as per usual. There was a small information office who sold ice cream and soda, but nothing else. I recommend you bring a lunch box so you don't go hungry when you visit the park this year.

The first thing we did was take the Shark Valley Tram Tour at the northern entrance. What an experience! A 2 hour ranger led tour on a tram through the everglades. Alligators,birds, turtles, etc. You could also bicycle or walk. Half way around the loop there is a lookout tower that you are able to walk up and the view of the everglades is amazing. The next day we entered the Main Gate at the Ernest C Coe visitors center. Did a ranger led walk on the Anhinga Trail, drove down to the Flamingo entrance where there was quite a bit of hurricane damage present.Then we were privileged to take the NIKE Missile Base Tour.I can't single one thing out over the other.

Garl has been leading trips here for many years and has intimate knowledge of the place as a skilled naturalist and wildlife photographer. We went on a ""slog"" through a watery section (water shoes provided!), followed by fresh-water and salt-water kayaking. Garl is so knowledgeable and experienced that he could spot wildlife (crocodiles, alligators, many species of birds and fish) where we couldn't at first, and we always felt in very capable hands.

The aninhga trail has boardwalk, so I suspect that a wheelchair could easily go down this trail. There are snowy egrets, a few great blue herons, and a few other birds I could not identify. They might be turkey vultures that like to attack the rubber on cars. The NPS provides tarps to cover cars. The gumbo limbo trail cannot be maneuvered with a wheel chair. It is a dirt trail and at least three branches cover the trail.","January 21, 2018",So many visitor centers,197,"Shelby Township, Michigan",4
Everglades National Park,"We were wondering what we would find after the hurricane damage last fall. Not everything is open but you can definitely go and enjoy the park. We stayed in a tent campsite near Flamingo, a big open field which was fairly uninspiring and covered with a dusty residue, possibly mud from being flooded by the ocean. Only one restroom was open in that area, it did have showers but they were cold. We spent one night hiking into a backcountry campsite which was awesome with amazing bird life but not for the casual hiker or camper or even for children (canoes were available for rent but not for going out on the ocean, only for use in an adjacent canal). We moved to Long Pine campground on our last night, which was very nice and tidy, lots of RV sites, nice restrooms and showers available. We also did a ranger led canoe trip in the mangrove swamp (free) informative and fun and saw a croc and some gators. My impression was that the park was not very busy, I suspect that people are staying away until the park is fully repaired. If you can put up with some measure of inconvenience, go now and enjoy the relative solitude. ","January 20, 2018",Amazing Birds,10,"Boston, Massachusetts",5

I had no idea how much of the park was inundated with water until our visit and I think a kayak would have taken the trip up a notch.

We took a bike ride (~15 miles roundtrip) at Shark valley and saw 20+ alligators along the bike path, as well as many birds. The panorama view at the iconic observation tower is well worth the effort. They also run tram tour on the same trail.We also took the ranger-led canoe trip early in the morning. The early morning fog on our way towards the canoe site (near Flamingo visitor center) is intriguing and beyond words. Paddling along the winding water trail surrounded by mangroves definitely needs some communication between you and your paddling partner.After the canoe trip we also took the ranger guided tour to the former Nike Missile site, which offers a rare history lesson inside a national park famous for its natural beauties. From the tour, I got a hand-on experience of how it felt like at the brink of war, which made me more cherish everything I saw in front of me.

Everglades National Park,"It was my mother's and my first time to the Everglades and it was a wonderful experience. I will say that the speed limit on the road shouldn't be so high, it was about the journey for us and I was often feeling stressed from people coming up on my bumper. Luckily there were several places for me to pull over and let them pass. I was concerned about wildlife injuries from vehicles. We actually had to stop for a Florida Softshell Turtle (an endangered species) to cross the road. The park was heavily affected by the rains after Irma and the water was very high. Many places were washed out but we stopped at most of them anyway just to look around. The flamingo point at the end of the road was where we saw a large wild croc (and several smaller ones) and dozens of manatees in the bay! It was very exciting as my mother had never seen them in the wild before. Spent nearly an entire day and it's definitely a memory I'll treasure.

Everglades National Park,"We entered that park off of HWY 41 (Shark Valley) on July 26th at 3:00 PM. I give the date and time as the attendant at the gate was the most unfriendly member of the NPS that I have ever encountered. It bothers me that there were so many foreign visitors at the park that afternoon that had to encounter him as the forked over the entrance fee. We encountered him again as we were exiting the park as we stopped to let him cross the road...he was still grumpy. The NPS staff inside and around the visitor center were friendly and answered questions with interest like it was the first time it was asked. Our expectations were set too high with respect to the amount of wildlife present. However, we were told this is not the best time of year to see wildlife. In just a short walk along the Bobcat Trail which is a boardwalk, we saw a gator, a black racer, and a turtle sneaking up on a very large crayfish. To gain the most benefit you must take the team out to the observation tower. $25 per person. Next time, we'll take an airboat ride to get out to the wildlife.TIP: in the gift shop, request they roll out the python skin....its huge!!!","July 27, 2017",Set My Expectations Too High,204,"Chattanooga, Tennessee",3

We visited during the off season, when the heat is intense and the mosquitoes can be voracious, so factor 50 and maximum deet are absolutes. But don't be put off! Mozzies vary enormously, and on the days we went down to Flamingo they were bearable....but at Mahogany Hammock we had to run! You soon get used to the conditions they prefer, and steer clear.

Then if you have more time, you could take a walk in the Mahogany Hammock or the Pa-hay-okee trail. Going down to Flamingo is cool if you have time--getting over to Shark Valley is a whole other day in my opinion.

Everglades National Park,"As the largest wilderness area east of the Mississippi River, the Everglades National Park is visited by over 1,000,000 people a year and protects a modest 20% of the Everglades. Recognized by many international organizations, the Everglades National Park is an International Biosphere Reserve, World Heritage Site and Wetland of International Importance.Before I start, the best way to understand and visit the park, as well as most parks, is to get off the beaten path and enjoy the backcountry. Many of the treasures shy away from crowds, and can not be found if you are not even willing to drive the 34 mile park road. Below, you will find a description of how I visit the park and hopefully my experience will help you develop wonderful experiences.The Everglades is a patchwork of wetlands interspersed with hammocks of forests created by a river flowing from Lake Okeechobee into Florida Bay. A great deal of the area is covered by water, and superb boating, fishing and snorkeling. In fact, the Everglades and Bay provide such diversity, you can snorkel, fish for peacock and largemouth bass, tackle tarpon and flyfish for permit all in a single outing (there are 300 different species of fish).The Everglades' diversity does not stop there. It is also provides the largest mangrove system and the most important birding area, especially for wading birds in the Americas (there are 350 species of birds). The mangroves act as a protected nursery for many animals including fish, birds and reptiles.Most importantly, the huge Everglades river recharges the underground aquifer, which serves Miami and the rest of southern Florida. Although the area has been inhabited for hundreds of years, only in the 19th century were the Everglades severely impacted when its waters were diverted and the land drained for agriculture and development. The impact was identified in the mid-20th century, as the population exploded.In response, protections included improving the flow of water to help ensure the Everglades received the water, the aquifer continued to be filled and the diverse habitat was protected.Today, the Everglades National Park protects the lower 20% of the Everglades along with much of Florida Bay. The Everglades provide a tremendous freshwater ecosystem, loaded with reptiles (40 species), fish and birds. Within this freshwater habitat, you can find water pathways often overhung by large trees and open pools of water, often formed by the alligators. The fishing and wildlife/bird watching is terrific.Further south, the river flows into Florida Bay, where saltwater fishing and snorkeling are a focus. Since the brackish water and mangroves in between the river and bay serve as a nursery, the fishing is terrific. My favorite past-time is fly fishing for tarpon, but permit, snook, shark and many other species are available, and can be reached from Florida City or the keys which form the southern and eastern border of the Bay.Because there is so much diverse water, it is a wonderful place for all sorts of boating. Airboats skim across the reeds and pools of the Everglades. Skiffs and bass boats follow the beautiful channels to find fish or swimming holes. Similar boats are poled along the flats of the bay, and deep sea boats look for bigger species in deep water. The most rewarding experience occurs watching children catch a boat load of fish, no matter or size of species. This area is truly a boatwoman's paradise.Moreover, to really explore the Everglades and Everglades National Park, you need a boat, but that need not cost you a fortune. My favorite was to travel is by canoe with the family or by kayak when alone. Canoes are easy to paddle and the Everglades is a wonderful place to learn. Whether you stay close to the park's headquarters or wander throughout its waterways, you will be awed by the experience and close family times you enjoy.From my perspective, there are two great times to visit the Everglades: (1) from December through March, when highs temperatures average in the mid to upper 70s (a very pleasant time to explore) and (2) for fishing, I prefer May because the cobia, grouper. sailfish and swordfish are all in the area and fishing is usually excellent.Although it is getting warm in May, that makes it perfect bikini weather for the boat.Now, let me describe my experiences through the photographs I am sharing. If you did not receive them or would like more, please just let me know. I would love to share my experiences.1, Canoeing: Although any type of boating in southern Florida is fun, my very favorite is to canoe. Silently exploring the Everglades not only removes of from the electronic world, but also doesn't disturb the wildlife. You can carry a 4 person family and all the gear needed for a long weekend in a canoe, or, better yet use several canoes.2. FIshing: For the avid fisherman, a wide variety of excellent fishing is available. Although different than most, catching is less important than being on the water with sun and family, and the freedom I find there, not to mention all that time to sun. My favorite time of year to fish is May, when many species are available to catch, and kids have a never ending experience. Freshwater fishing in the channels of the river provide excellent bass fishing, flat fishing always produces tarpon, permit and a variety of other fish3. Hammock: After a long paddle, it is nice to rest in a hammock with the cool breeze blowing across Florida Bay. It is truly relaxing.4. Canoe and Mangroves: In this view, you can see the canoe in the background, as well as a few mangroves. Mangroves are essential and the steel building block that holds most of the Everglades coastal front together.5. Florida Bay: You can see the beautiful Florida Bay in the background, but can only imagine the excellent fishing until you get there yourself. Florida Bay and the surrounding waters provide some of the best saltwater fishing in the United States, as well as a huge expanse of land you can explore without crowds (if you get away from the roads).6. Hygiene: It is critical to practice perfect hygiene and to wash away the salt every day to avoid skin problems. Also, covering up is important to keep the sun away. Another benefits of washing is to cool off especially after an extended exertion.7. Tent: It is important to have a good tent, although an expensive one is not required. The tent keeps the bugs away so ensure it is bug proof with bug proof mesh (especially against the little noseeums. The tent also keeps the sun off. Finally, if things need to be dry, the tent serves as a safe dry spot.8. Wildlife: Bird and wildlife are prolific offering hours of exciting exploration and viewing, not to mention photography.I hope this was helpful, but if you need more information please write, by sending me a message here or through facebook at my personal account (angie.segura.549).","June 14, 2017",Get Off The Road To See This Awesome Park,482,"Pemba, Mozambique",5

Everglades National Park,"We were staying mainly in Orlando during our USA holiday so it was a long drive down to Florida City to get to the edge of this part of the Everglades but as it was part of Florida I hadn't seen on a previous visit, I wanted to make the effort, especially for my daughter who was keen to go out on a boat into the Everglades to see at least something of the wildlife. The Ernest Coe visitor centre is worth a trip for 30 - 45 minutes but then you have to pay an exorbitant $25 to get into the next bit of the national park a couple of miles further down the road. With rip off charges at Universal + Disney ($20 each time) this really hacked me off. What do you do when you've driven so far? Pay it of course!! I felt the excuse of this fee lasting 7 days pretty weak. There should be a day charge of say $10 and then the 7 day one for more money. I doubt anyone except staff and super committed nature fans goes here for 7 days!! The Anhinga trail just after this toll section (spend about an hour on it) was interesting and we were able to see some alligators and turtles with a few different birds from a walkway above the water. We also happened to catch, by chance really, a park ranger 'lunchtime chat' which lasted about 20 minutes which was interesting. I was glad I had asked about the boat rides at Ernest Coe as they were not available (40 miles further on at the Flamingo Visitor Centre bit of the park) because they hadn't recruited enough drivers. It's a heck of a commute to get to work each day if you don't live down there. I suspect we didn't miss a lot except the mosquitoes which I was pleased to avoid. Fortunately my wife and daughter were able to get into the Everglades Alligator Farm not too far away so they were able to experience the boat trip which they enjoyed very much as well as handle baby 'gators' and see some snakes being fed. We returned to the Kissimmee/Orlando by taking a route back via one of the big lakes in central Florida as an alternative to Interstate 95. This route, though a little slower, was much less busy. I was pleased I'd taken the 95 on the way down as opposed the turnpike (toll road) option. Overall as a break from 'theme parks' it was great to see a totally different part of the state. It's your call if you want to drive so far to see it though!! I'm glad I did. I can recommend Florida City Travelodge near the edge of the park as a BASIC hotel to stay at if you go down and make sure you find 'Robert is here' (19200 SW 344 Street, Homestead) on your way to the Ernest Coe centre or after it. You won't be disappointed. Open 7 days a week but closed Sept and Oct. It's a tropical fruit/juices/smoothies place and a lot more besides like honey, jams, sauces, marinades etc etc. Whatever you do though DO NOT have their tiny individual Key Lime pies. Yuk! Soggy pastry and bland stodgy filling. Maybe their $18 bigger pies were nicer!! Everything else was lovely, so don't let this put you off a visit.

It appeared to us that we were the only people renting a skiff that day. There were some other boats out but by the time we got out into open water they were already on the far shoreline. We went through quiet Tarpon Creek where we saw shark, two manatee, and an alligator. While we were going through Coot Bay (I think) we were joined by a playful dolphin who swam along our boat, under the boat, on his back and added a few high water snorts. That certainly made our day! Once we were in Whitewater Bay we started exploring and casting. We found a Mangrove Tree filled island and caught a wide variety of fish. We should have stayed put since we didn't have much luck in other places. So we returned to the small island and continued to do well fishing. We catch and release so no dinner for us - just the enjoyment of a great day fishing. Be sure to take sun screen and mosquito spay!

Everglades National Park,"First, I only went as far as Mahogany Hammock Trail because as you will see from a map, the main drag is one long road (35 miles or so). Thus, every mile you go in, you have to retrace the same mileage back out. Anhinga Trail is the best...lots of alligators and some birds around in addition to different kinds of fish. It is a sun which is a + and a minus. Obviously it can get hot but the sun keeps the mosquitos away. I used repellent but really didn't need it. Gumbo Limbo is exact opposite...shady and heavily forested near the trail and the mosquitos have an army there! Use repellent as I did. Pa-hay-okee trail and Mahogany Hammock Trails I also took and are short and OK. Anhinga IMO is the best and the longest...and not that long. The road is worn for part of the way to Mahogany Hammock. From MH to Flamingo is supposed to be brand new concrete. From MH to Royal Palms Visitor Center, it is more good road combined with old road that is now coming through asphalt topping...still paved but they will be concreting that also according to rangers.","May 21, 2017",It is what it is,294,"Saint Louis, Missouri",3

We live in central Florida and have always wanted to go through the everglades. It is just a road with side stops. There are tons and tons of mosquitoes. We were loaded with spray. We opened our car to get in there were approx. 50 in our car. . We saw a few crocodiles, mosquitoes, crows, nothing else. One lake had birds but you needed binoculars to see them. The only restrooms we found working were in the campground. All the rest of them were locked. Very disappointing. ","April 19, 2017",Very disappointed ,6,"Palm Bay, Florida",2

Everglades National Park,"Very accessible national park with great staff. I came with certain expectations of wetlands, wetlands, wetlands. Was very pleased with the incredible diversity in the park that just a few feet in elevation makes. I didn't expect the pinelands and the cypress trees and hardwood hammocks! Took the ranger led tour on the Anhinga Amble and saw many gators and birds. Also went on the tram ride at Shark Valley which was very informative, although it did rain (take weather gear on cloudy days as rain can happen in a hurry in Florida). Lots of up-close views of gators and birds on this ride. Very well run park that gets the point across that our national parks are a treasure that MUST be preserved and appreciated.

Everglades National Park,"I visited South Florida in the 1960s (but not Everglades NP) and I've been to Florida a few times since, to all the glitzy new attractions (read: Disney / Universal / Sea World / Cruises etc). Going to the Everglades this past week seemed like I went back to the 1960s. It really did look like a place from way back when.That's not a bad thing, just very different. The buildings looked old, with that flat stucco-painted-pink-or-sky-blue texture and there just weren't a lot of amenities. And the trails and boardwalks looked very, very weathered. I hope that the upkeep is ongoing, but I can't tell from looking at the sights there (particularly the boardwalks). Maybe the budget is not adequate for a millions of acres park.We enjoyed almost all of the places we visited within the park--Anhinga and Paurotis Pond and West Lake and Mahogany Trail and Pay-ho-kee (or however it's spelled) and Gumbo-Lingo and Shark Valley and the West side mangrove boat tour. Really, only Snake Bight (lots and lots of mosquitoes) and Nine Mile Lake (truly for paddlers) were less exciting. We saw terrain from swampy grass to jungle to African savanna all within a few miles of one another. And plenty of birds.But in many ways, it's sad. The educational displays (and the excellent film) point out how devastating the diversion of all that water has been and because of more northern attractions in the state, it seems that people are bypassing this gem more than ever (just check the stats on the NPS site and you'll see that this year is down more than 50% from last year). I don't know that jazzing the place up would be a good thing, though. After all, National Parks and National Wildlife Refuges are supposed to be fairly bare-bones affairs. But that doesn't seem to be luring in the younger domestic visitors. :(","April 15, 2017",A Step Back in Time,195,"Clemson, South Carolina",4
Everglades National Park,"Family vacation to the Everglades National Park. We had been anticipating an active adventure including the starlight stroll, ranger-led biking adventure through the park, and a ranger-guides walk through the wetlands/slough. However, when we arrived, the peak season had apparently just ended a couple days earlier (March 31st) and none of the activities were being offered aside from a very short ranger hike. We did very much enjoy the Anhinga Trail and saw many alligator and birds. It was wonderful to be able to observe these animals in a natural setting rather simply seeing alligators in a pit being forced to take part in a show with a wrangler. We also walked the Gumbo-Limbo trail, and indeed were bit by the mosquitoes - but enjoyed it nonetheless. There were amazing stops along the main road and this kept us very entertained, though the trip was not as filled with adventure as we'd expected given the cut-ff date for ranger led adventures. We drove all the way to Flamingo and had the delight of seeing a large crocodile also. The visitor centers were excellent, and the wonderful short video is something I recommend watching at the Ernest Coe visitor center theater.","April 15, 2017",Just missed the peak season,8,"Rochester, United States",4

Everglades National Park,"This is a large park that is best visited in the cooler time of the year (December-early April). The rest of the year mosquito densities make it almost impossible to visit and it is warm and very humid. At the right time of the year it is great to walk the numerous trails. Many wading birds (herons, egrets, Anhingas, Roseate spoonbills etc) winter in the park so this is also the time to see many of these types of birds.The main visitor center is near the entrance closer to Florida City and there is a small one at Flamingo. Two campgrounds,long pine key and flamingo offer camping opportunities. Long Pine key does not have electric hookups for RV'S and flamingo does. Mosquitoes tend to be worst at Flamingo. Long Pine campground is much prettier and private than Flamingo and now they finally have sowers.If this is your first time it is important to stop at the visitor center to get information about hikes and the park.

Everglades National Park,"While some national parks have striking & dramatic scenery, this one features a very unique ecosystem with an understated landscape. It is truly far more than ""just a swamp"". To appreciate the Everglades, one must understand that MOST of the South Florida area is Everglades (not cities & beaches). This system is a gigantic river of grass & wetlands covering most of South Florida. The roadway takes through a small sliver of the park, and shows you samples. The first stop, The Royal Palm is great is you have only limited time. There are 2 trails here: Anhinga Trail, and Gumbo Limbo Trail. Both a very well kept and marked. The Anhinga Trail will let you view allagators up close, yet from a safe location. Another location woth visiting is the ""Mahogany Hammock"" trail. At this place, the ground is a few more feet above sealevel, and that changes the whole ecosystem into a subtropical rain-forest.

We started at the Earnest Coe Visitor Center to look around in the gift shop and look at all the informative displays. Then we hiked the Anhinga Trail near the Royal Palm area. This is where you get to see quintessential Everglades. On this short .8 mile loop hike, you'll immediately see Alligators, Turtles, Anhingas, Egrets, Herons and much more. The whole path is teeming with wildlife. There isn't much shade along the walk to bring water and be prepared for the heat. We didn't have any problems with mosquitoes on this trail.We also hiked the .4 mile Gumbo Limbo Trail. This trail is through the woods along a paved trail.

We have visited four times in the last two years and each time is different and exciting - it is like going on a nature treasure hunt, and once is not enough - it should be a stop each time you are in the area. In the past we saw a huge alligator resting alongside the trail, so close that you had to walk carefully around him, and this time almost 20 alligators basking in the sun at the end of the boardwalk! Also a nest of baby Anhingas who were being fed by their mother - just across the pond from the Royal Palm Visitor Center. The vultures were not attacking the rubber around the windshields, but that is something that one has to consider as part of the experience - we put the tarp (provided by the National Park Service) over the car just in case.","April 1, 2017",An ever-changing and easily accessible window into the best of the Everglades,210,"Ferney-Voltaire, France",5

Clean, family friendly showers, cleanish bathrooms and plenty of sites to choose from. Was told there were less bugs than in flamingo.

Please stay in your cars. You can slow down to look at them, but don't block traffic. And DON'T...do not....get out of your car to take a picture next to the alligator. People will. They are stupid.

Paurotis Pond is a pond you can stop at: it has a huge number of birds. We were fortunate enough to run into a birder with a spotting scope who let us look through at a stork and a roseate spoonbill and who could also identify for us some of the birds we saw as they flew by. If you like birds, even casually, this is a GREAT stop.And finally, if you visit late in the day, stick around until close to sunset -- check out Paurotis Pond and/or go back to the Anhinga Trail, because a lot of wildlife get more active and more visible at the end of the day.But definitely go, regardless of the time of day! The Everglades are amazing.We did the Backcountry Boat Tour while we were there, but honestly we saw less wildlife on the tour than we did just stopping off at various locations at the park. (This probably depends on your luck and the day.)Bring bug spray: mosquitoes weren't a problem for us on the Anhinga Trail but we definitely encountered them elsewhere in the park.","March 25, 2017",Truly amazing wildlife and birds,21,Minneapolis,5

You will see lots of birds, turtles and alligators. The second time that we went we counted 31 alligators all sunning themselves in one fairly small area. This is an easy trail to walk as it is all paved or is a wide boardwalk and it is not a long distance. There are also ranger guided tours on this trail.

Make sure you have enough fuel and take anything you will want. That includes plenty of fluids to drink, what ever food you will want for the time you are there, and plenty of mosquito repellent. We found the Off Deep Woods Sportsman to be effective. We did need to reapply the repellent after an hour or two. We were there at the end of February which is supposed to be winter. Temperatures were in the 80's in the middle of the day. The wind was blowing 20 to 30 MPH and the mosquitoes were bad out in the open in the middle of the day. We heard you cannot get anything in the park, but that was wrong. There is a store at the marina with the usual variety of drinks and snacks. There is also a food truck serving sandwiches and dinners. We had a great fish sandwich, although I am not sure that it was the stated variety of fish. We canoed and bicycled and met many friendly people. Yes we say alligators and a crocodile. However we were disappointed there were not more animals. The fresh water level was very low.

We did stop at Mahogony Hummock, which was the best part of the visit (not counting Anhinga Trail, of course). What an amazing place. We did see manatees at the Marina but no crocs. We left and went west along the Tamiana Parkway, so we saw the Northern boundary. And, finally, we went to Everglades City and took the Mangrove Wilderness Boat Tour (a must) which was the only way we could see the west side. It grew on me as I learned and saw more.

We could have opted for a 15 mile bike ride, which we would have preferred, but we were too late to rent the bikes. What was nice about the tram ride, was the narrative, so we could learn about the park, the animals, and some other information. We saw over 50 alligators in our two hour tour. They were everywhere we looked! More prominent in some areas than others. Very fascinating creatures. The grassy mossy region is pretty interesting , and unlike anywhere I've ever been. They let you get off the tram to go up on an observation deck which is nice to see the expanse of the area. The second day we went to the Coe Visitor center and did the walk on an elevated boardwalk. This is a different area than Shark Valley and we saw more areas of water, lily pads, and all matter of birds! At the end of the walkway there are quite a number of alligators and it was fascinating to see them swim through the channels and walk up onto the mud. Overall, the Everglades are well worth a few days of your time. The closest hotels you can find are in Homestead, which is a small town but has what you need as far as restaurants, shops and hotels.

Everglades National Park,"Everglades Park has a northern entrance and a Southern entrance near Florida City. After stopping at the Visitor Center for a map and advice on what to see, you pass through the entrance gate, and enter the Park. It is 38 miles from the gate to the end of the road at Flamingo; along the road are many places to stop for hiking and/or viewing. The best place is the Anhinga Trail at the first stop, so stop there, and take your time to walk the whole path - see the birds and 'gators. The other trails in the park will excite you more or less depending on your interests. At the end of the road is Flamingo with a small restaurant and supply store (for boaters etc) and toilets. There are boat tours available (check on line). You can spend a day here, or a week here if you want to walk all of the trails, and watch the wildlife.

We drove 1 hour to Flamingo and took a boat tour of the Mangroves. Worth the money. Capt Steve gave an excellent tour. We saw birds and dolphins but there is never a guarantee you might. But we learned so much about the eco system of the park. On the way out we stopped at Royal Palm for the Anhinga Trail. A great day. Day 2 we drove to the Gulf Coast Visitor Center. Lots of birds along the canal on Rt 41. Did a boat tour of the 10,000 Islands. Another great learning experience. Hit most of the overlooks on the way back toward Florida City. NEGATIVES: The park office at Flamingo and Gulf Coast are the worst NPS Centers I have ever been to. Staff not helpful and buildings are drab and dumpy. BRING FOOD. There is a little cafe downstairs at Flamingo. Food is fair and the staff is nice. I would not recommend buying anything but boat tickets at the Marina.

It made for very peaceful explorations.We took a boat trip out of Flamingo at sunset and it was very peaceful, we saw birds flying in to roost, nesting Ospreys, a bunch of sea turtle coming up to breathe, and jumping fish.

It's a shame the urban development and agriculture has changed the water flow of the area. Hope the preserved land will thrive. Anhinga trail is the place to see all the animals (to see manatees have to go down to flamingo visitor centre).The other trails just an experience of different habitats, didn't see any animals on other trails.

Everglades National Park,"My 9 year old son and I have been visiting national parks for the past 2 years and this was our 12th. It's very different from parks out west in that it is very canoe-oriented, not hiking oriented. There are limited walking trails, so it's a bit harder to get a sense of the expanse or wilderness unless you are boating. The Flamingo area was also damaged by hurricanes and has not been restored and looks a bit worn. There is also no lodging in the park, so we stayed in a hotel outside the park, which also detracted a little from the wilderness experience. The wildlife viewing, however, is spectacular. We saw a dozen alligators in Shark Valley and tons of shorebirds. My son enjoyed it and I'm glad he got a different kind of park experience. The boardwalks are fun for walking on and the waterfront is beautiful. All the wildlife spotting also kept things very interesting.","January 2, 2017",Everglades with my 9 year old,33,,4

We stopped by the visitor center near homestead to start and then went to Anhina Trail. We saw 4 alligators. We skipped the limbo gumbo trail which is right next to Anhina, but I wish we would've done this jungle-like trail. We then drove an easy 50 minutes to Flamingo with a small stop to see the overlook. Once at flamingo, we are at the restaurant, which was surprisingly good. Alligator nuggets were delicious. Bring your own water bottles if you have them because they charge $2.50 for a bottle of water. We saw manatees in the marina by chance. When asked, our waitress suggested we make it to Mahogany trail to try to find the nesting owl before sunset. This was on our way back to the homestead entrance. It was amazing at sunset. It felt like we were in the jungle. Very cool experience. My favorite part of the trip, maybe because it was so unexpected and at sunset. This was an almost-all day park.

Everglades National Park,"I went to Everglades with my gf. We hesitated between spending more time at shark valley or the flamingo center area and decided to go for both, I have to say I enjoyed my time at the shark valley way more than the other. If you were time constrained like I was, take the tram ride, it was an awesome experience with an educational guide giving us a rundown on the place, pointing out the fauna/flora that we would definitely have otherwise missed if we went walking/cycling alone. There was an abundance of alligators and even baby alligators! The tram ride would cost you about $24 dollars, take you about 2 hours and renting a bike would cost you $9/hr. We also went to Anhiga trail which was great but wasn't as exciting after shark valley. It was a very calm place to take a walk but we didn't see much here.If you have the time/ capability, I would stay at Pa-Hay-Okee to see the sunset and night view! The night sky here was beautiful. I was also able to get up close to an owl here. I was told by the park rangers that EcoPond is a great place to go and see manatees, but I only saw mosquitoes, even through my binoculars. I am NOT even kidding. Swamps of mosquitoes ATTACKED us immediately upon stepping into the pond area and we had to run out and up our cars, which a few of them got in as well. Mind you, this is after reading the reviews and basically covering ourselves with mosquito repelant.","December 20, 2016",Alligators Galore,4,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",4

If you are more comfortable, you will enjoy it more - pretty simple equation! Great bird life - bald eagle, osprey, belted kingfisher, roseate spoonbill (this was my first sighting!). The mosquitoes were not bad until after sunset - then watch out! A teeny tiny dinner bell rang, and they came out in force - but what would one expect - it's the Everglades!! The staff were all great. We rented canoes and kayaks later in the day. If there is a wind, I would go with the kayaks next time - lower profile to get caught in the wind.

After having several very good days at the Big Cypress reserve adjacent to north side of the Everglades, our trip to the Everglades was a disaster. Almost no birds even on the Anhinga Trail. Turns out with the very wet year, the birds had delayed their arrival. And with the warm weather, the mosquitoes were intolerable. Just jumping in and out of the car as fast as possible was a guarantee of more than a dozen mosquitoes getting into the car.

Everglades National Park,"Entered the National Park at the Ernest Coe Visitor Centre. The staff were superb. Friendly, helpful and informed. Carmen, a volunteer, was particularly patient with my numerous questions and was an absolute treasure and fountain of knowledge. There are wonderful displays in the Centre, a movie theatre where they show material on the Everglades and of course a gift shop and bathroom facilities. Maps and other educational materials are readily available. It's $25 per car to enter the park and that pass is good for 7 days. You pay at the park entrance not at the visitor centre. I then went to Royal Palm Visitor Centre. Much smaller but clean and well maintained. There are two walking trails here: Ahinga trail and another I can't recall. We saw birds, an alligator, turtles, flowers and butterflies. There are interpretive signs and covered areas. You have to cover your car with tarp while here as vultures will scratch it. Tarps and fasteners are provided free of charge. So you may have heard or read terrible things about the mosquitos. Fortunately I had no problems. I had one bite and that's because I didn't want to use bug spray and I wore short sleeves. There were kids and babies out and about in shorts and tanks. The staff said the mosquitoes aren't too bad during the dry season (Dec - end March). Beware the wet season though, mosquitos are a nightmare then. Also plan enough time to explorer. You need an entire day to get the full experience. That was my big mistake. I'll have to return. From Royal Palm VC to the Flamingo VC is a one hour drive. The boat tours are all located at the Flamingo VC. There are no airboat tours inside the park - not allowed. Also the gator farm places are outside the park. Will also check those out when I return.

Everglades National Park,"This park is amazing. It is huge roughly about 2000 miles. It is a park that calls to the true nature lover. Upon reaching the visitor center-which you must explore- talk to local volunteers and rangers. They are incredibly knowledgable. If you want to see gators, they will tell you were to go, if you are a botanist enthusiast they will tell you where to go,or if you want the best place to see the sunset or more animal life they will direct you, if you want to camp or hike they will tell you where to go. My favorite was a volunteer by the name of Carmen. She knows everything about this park! They really should pay her.Come prepared with repellant and loose fitting clothes because it is hot and the mosquitoes are truly alive here. However, there is one thing consolation about the annoying mosquitos here, according to park specialist there has never been a case of the mosquitos carrying causing any diseases such as Zika or dengue fever. They said this was because of the constant flow of water.After exiting the visitors center you will have many trails that you can explore. Beware, the very first trail, Anhinga, attracts vultures to cars, yes I said vultures, so be prepared to cover your cars with tarp provided by the park, however this is where you will likely see an alligator.To get to the end of the park it will take you approximately one hour from the visitors center.

Everglades National Park,"I've been to the Shark Valley entrance to the Everglades many times! I love the park; its truly beautiful and I always see plenty of alligators and birds; some alligators so close you could almost touch them! BUT DON'T! On 4 occasions I have rented the park bikes, most recently over the Thanksgiving weekend and every time they are just horrible! While its the best way to enjoy the park if you enjoy biking the 15 miles round trip; the bikes are in such poor shape, it can be unpleasant! Knowing this, I always get an early start and arrive in the park no later than one hour after opening, so I can test drive a few bikes. The bikes are OLD, in poor repair, although they have a staff always working on them. The day we were there (November 25th) there seemed to be more bikes awaiting repairs than there were for rent! They don't have hand breaks, only pedal breaks,very uncomfortable seats and some are very difficult to pedal or make noise all the time while pedaling. TRY ridding several! To make matters worse, they are EXPENSIVE to rent at $9 hour on top of the $25 entrance fee to the park! If you have your own bike, you can use it in the park; highly recommended!Their tram trip is excellent; do make reservations especially from Thanksgiving to the end of February. Be sure to go early! We arrived at 9am and left at 12:30pm and saw a huge line of cars to enter the park, no inside park parking and loads of people parking outside the park to gain access. Remember if you are over 62 years old and a USA citizen, you can register with a government ID for a free pass to all the National Parks in the USA.

Everglades National Park,"We visited the park in late October and it rained for two out of three days. On the first day we followed the tradition route from Homestead to the Ernest Coe Visitor Center and eventually reached Flamingo Visitor Center, which was closed. We went on a ranger led walk through the Anhinga Trail but saw no wildlife and we had pouring rain at the end. I guess the park is quite wet at the end of the rainy season and alligators could hide anywhere, on top of that they just finished renovating the trail and it will take a little longer for the wildlife to come back. The next day we woke up early trying to catch the sunrise at Pa-hay-okee Overlook but again the weather was not very cooperative and we ended up finding some birds around the West Lake area. The third morning we woke up early again and the weather was reasonable, we drove west on the Tamiami Trail and reached the Shark Valley Visitor Center before 9, we found out there is a tram running at 9:30, the ride is around 2 hours for $24. What an amazing ride, because it was in the morning, bird and wildlife were amazingly active and we had many BIF and alligator shots, it is indeed a wildlife photographer's dream. We will definitely go back to explore further, but will take a little more time to plan ahead.

Everglades National Park,"The Everglades represent one of the worlds great wetlands. Barely a few feet above sea level this landscape has a river of water continually running through it known as a Slough (pronounced slew). Consequently as such it is NOT stagnant water and therefore not a swamp as we know it. More a river delta in actuality.There are many short trails you can walk by yourself, raised as walkways above the wetlands part, or as well constructed bedded trails in the more solid ""hammock islands"" parts. The visitor centres are top notch (America does this SO well!) with knowledgeable rangers, excellent displays, a park film and free talks. On the walkways watch carefully and you will see alligators, many different types of birds, large insects, and turtles. It is of concern however that this fragile park is highly threatened by projected sea level rises of a metre or more this century due to global warming. Much of Florida is significantly exposed this way being by far the flattest state in America.","November 4, 2016",Fascinating wetlands (not a swamp!),174,"Lower Hutt, New Zealand",5

Everglades National Park,"People rave about the Everglades and, as a native, I would love to, but I just cannot. This is a boring National Park with unimpressive facilities and limited hiking options. I went in the slow time (summer) and the most popular trail (Anhinga) was closed, but even if it had been open, I feel I would've been disappointed. I appreciate its place in the ecosystem and the vastness is impressive, but it just isn't visually appealing. The southern drive is pretty boring and most of the hikes I did were short and unimpressive. The facilities are lacking too. The Flamingo visitor center, for example, seems like it recently went through the apocalypse. Sure a hurricane hit it, but we're talking over a decade ago. The water activities for boaters might be impressive, but for hikers, you might be disappointed. After you've seen a few gators, you've seen them all and then what? I've been to state parks in Florida that I've been more impressed with (such as Payne's Prairie). If you've been to any other national parks, you should know there needs to be a higher standard here and Everglades just does not meet that bar.

Everglades National Park,"I live in the area so I have a national park pass to this park. The best trail in there is Anhinga Trail which has a nice boardwalk and the opportunity to see alligators and birds up close and in their natural setting. I visited this week, April 28th, 2016 and was surprised to see 1/2 the boardwalk gone on the Anhinga trail. They are clearly working to repair it but for those taking the time to go out there you may want to call first before going to see how far the progress is. The road you walk down is 1/2 closed off due to construction and this is where you used to see a lot of alligators. It also is NOT quiet out there anymore because of the equipment and what sounds like a generator running constantly. When I was there at 3 pm on this past thursday there were 2 guys working, one on a bobcat and the other down at the end of the road doing some type of drilling. It looks like it will be a while before they finish and it is quite a drive out there. Add into that the fee you would pay to get in - you may want to wait till they finish up everything. I saw 1 bird while there and 2 alligators. Not the norm compared to my past visits there (5-6 other times).","May 1, 2016",A beautiful park but construction is going on right now,62,"Boston, Massachusetts",3

After parking at the Pa-hay-okee Overlook, we got out of our car and wondered why most of the other vehicle had blue tarps over them. Come to find out, the park offers these to visitors because the vultures love to pick apart the rubber on vehicles. Once we walked to the water, there was an alligator at least 8 feet long slowly swimming back an forth between the banks. There were other notable stops along the park as well.

It turned out to the one of the best stops on our trip. After a stop at Visitor Center we went only a couple miles to the Royal Palm site, where we took a walking trail. The walking trail is very safe, as it is a raised wooden boardwalk through the swamp. We saw fish, herons, numerous other birds and LOTS of alligators laying in the sun, crawling around and swimming.

Unfortunately, because of a tight timeline, we just had time to drive the route between Homestead and Flamingo Point and spend a short time at each visitor's center.

Just take your time walking through here and you will see the gators hiding just footsteps from you. Something for everyone to enjoy and see here. Expect to drive a good bit too and not see much as the other stop off points might 30 miles away.

Everglades National Park,"We visited the Everglades National Park between Florida City and the Flamingo section on 2 separate days and were not disappointed. It's a great way to get to know what the Everglades are all about.One word of warning: it can take up to 15 minutes to pass the entrance gate at Florida City because of the backup of cars paying the entrance fee, take this into account when planning timed ranger tours or boat trips. And Flamingo is still a long 50 minute drive from the entrance gate. Make sure to plan accordingly!Some highlights worth visiting:We did the Backwater Country boat tour reserved which leaves from Flamingo. This was a great tour to see some of the aquatic sections of the park that are hard to explore. It was actually a chilly day so sadly we didn't see any crocodiles or alligators, but we did see manatees.The Ernest Coe Visitor Center has a great movie that explains how the Everglades were formed and how the sloughs work (in essence very slow moving wide rivers).Some great hikes you should not miss in this section of the park are the Mohageny Hammock, the Pa-Hay-okee Overlook and the Anhinga Trail. Especially the Anhinga trail has great wildlife viewing of wading birds, fish and yes, alligators. Make sure to come on a warm, sunny day so the alligators are out warming themselves. On cool, overcast days they will hide.We also hiked the Gumbo Limbo trail and the Pinelands trail. Especially the Pinelands trail shows you the variety of temperate and tropical plants living together, which is very special. All hikes are between 0.4 and 0.8 miles long and fully accessible.All in all a great treasure to the US and a great national park to visit.","March 24, 2016","Great national park, but prepare to do a lot of driving!",129,"Yonkers, New York",4

Everglades National Park,"With the wettest winter in memory, the Everglades experience has certainly changed. We visited Shark Valley expecting the concentration of wildlife around the canals and ponds of that area. However, high water during this normal ""dry"" period had dispersed the birds and reptiles.

Better luck next year if the drought conditions return!","February 24, 2016",Too much water!!!,42,"Chester, Virginia",3

Everglades National Park,"I just read a review that mentioned the welcome center - I have to agree, they were not very welcoming. But after that, it's all good. NOTE: don't even think about parking in the lot. Plan to park on the highway in the first available spot and hoof it to the entrance booth. There was a line of cars about 30 deep. After we turned around, parked on the road like the others and walked our way in, we found out that when a car leaves, they let a car in the lot. Might be good to know if you are travelling with children or in a challenging situation. We did the tram tour - 2 hrs and relatively expensive, but I don't mind in a National Park - as the place is huge and we felt it was the best way to learn about the Everglades in a shorter period of time. There are plenty of areas you can walk to, but we saw tons of people on bikes. I heard that was also very expensive for rentals, but you can take your own. A morning with bikes and an afternoon tram tour would probably be the perfect way to do a day. Take a picnic if you will be there awhile. If you love combining nature and sports, spend some time researching their activities. There are nighttime bike rides, 5k's and other runs, boating adventures. etc...","February 22, 2016",Park on the road (FYI) - enjoy the nature!,41,Pennsylvania,4

The next day we drove across the northern boundary and stopped at the Oasis visitor centre on highway 41, where we saw lots of gators.

We went on the wait list, turned up at 7.45 and ended up on a stunning 3-hour canoe trip on the '9 mile pond' canoe trail. For zero dollars! The ranger (Sarah) was a superb guide and the scenery was wonderful. We also enjoyed sunset at the Pa-hay-okee lookout on our first day, and saw around a dozen manatees at the marina in Flamingo after the canoe trip.

It was the same time of year both times. 5 years ago the Anhinga walkway was teeming with wildlife. Several dozen gaters, 100 yo 150 anhingas including babys, many Herons and other birds. This year 5 anhingas, no gaters, one blue heron and and a few turtles. The contrast was amazing. Shark valley had gaters but fewer than 5 years ago and little birdlife. I heard some say that they had been told that there was too much water this year. At the Flamingo marina I saw brown pelicans, manatees, dolphins and one gater.

The bike was cool looking, included water bottle holder and bike basket BUT was a challenge for the entire 15 mile loop because it was older and hard to peddle facing the wind. Long stretches of the ride we were by ourselves and didn't encounter other riders. The parking lot was full so we parked outside the fats along the road and paid the $8.00 per person walk in fee.

Everglades National Park,"We visited the western portion of Everglades National Park. This part of the park is accessible from Everglades City, and we drove there from Naples Florida. We visited in January, which is normally a great time to visit, being the cooler, dryer time of year. Apparently in the summer months, the temperature and humidity are so high that there are few visitors to the park. But worse than the weather is the mosquitoes, apparently so thick and dense in number as to be unbearable.We went in January, and although it was unusually cold and rainy for January, we hit it on the right day and the weather was fine.The western portion of the park has a small gift shop and interpretative centre, as well as a look out tower. The main attraction is the boat rides. There are two destination, around the ten thousand islands, or through the mangroves. We chose the ten thousand islands. We saw pelicans, osprey and cormorants. We were hoping to see alligators and manatees, and so were a bit disappointed. The captain didn't seem to know where alligators and manatees could be found. Luckily a pod of dolphins found us, and put on quite a show, following the boat and leaping out of the water.I asked where manatees could be seen, and someone else on the boat suggested Port of the Islands resort. Port of the Islands is a resort, marina and property development built around a series of boating channels that connects to the Gulf. Manatees come there to feed in the warm waters. Boat tours are offered, and we saw not only manatees feeding, but alligators sunning themselves and lots of birds as well.","January 28, 2016",Everglades Gulf Coast experience,75,Edmonton,3

This was a blessing for quieting the mosquitoes, but not as much for bird or gator watching. In the past when we've visited there were abundant water birds and alligators sunning themselves, this day they must have been snuggled down in the brush. We did see a couple of gators on the Anhinga trail, and made the drive down to Flamingo. Plan to take time for the boat tours if you make the drive, they offer an up close and more insightful view into this unique area.Also, pack snacks, drinks and lunch! Food service is mostly non-existent. The little restaurant in Flamingo is really a snack bar with beer.

Everglades National Park,"We decided to camp in Flamingo at a 'walk-to site'. We had booked for three nights but ended up staying just one because of the intensity of mosquitos. The campsite is on a stunning piece of beach overlooking Florida Bay. The breeze kept the mosquito levels lower than expected but they still bit constantly and got in the tent if I ever opened it even for two seconds. I am applying anti-itch cream as I write this. The various trails are really short and could be done really easily even by people with limited mobility and (as I witnessed) by people wearing heels!However, by far my top favourite things were not spotting the alligators and crocodiles but the manatees in the harbour. They were swishing around and drinking the water coming out of an a/c unit of a boat. Absolutely amazing animals and such a treat to watch. We were also lucky to watch a beautiful display from a pod of dolphins who decided to swim along with our boat at a tour of the bay.

I had reservations for the Florida Bay tour, and that was fine, but we only saw a few Dolphins. I should have chosen the Mangrove tour to see the alligators. It was a beautiful day in the park. Take your time and walk a few trails and you will see wildlife. Plan ahead and book a boat ride.

Everglades National Park,"It has been years since we drove to the park's flamingo area. It was a cool day, but still lots of mosquitos from the standing water. We did not see crocs, gators, manatees, blue herons, etc We did take note that camping was still available for $20.00 per night per tent. Also if you were to stay in the park, the rangers have a 3 and a half hour canoe trip that goes out most mornings. There were other ranger programs limited in scope and time, two other times in the day. There were boat tours available through a concessionaire although a bit pricey. The best way to see most of what the park has to offer is certainly on the water. Weather wise we weren't up for it.","December 20, 2015",Flamingo minus the wildlife,62,"Hollywood, Florida",5
Everglades National Park,"My wife and I have been to the Flamingo and Shark Valley visitor centers in the Everglades National Park. I'll talk about Flamingo first. From Florida City, its about a 45 minute drive to Flamingo Bay. Its a pretty long drive across the park, but road is in excellent shape and the speed limit is 55 mph so the trip is shorter than what you might expect looking at a map. About 10 minutes from Florida City you come to the visitor's center which is really nice. There are several displays and a very informative movie about the are and the history and future if the Everglades. It is a must stop. The fee is $20 a car, but if your planning on spending any time in the park its worth it. Tip: You can buy a yearly pass to all of the National Parks for $80. Once you get to Flamingo Bay you can a couple of boat tours. One goes out in the bay, where you will see all kinds of different birds, sharks, manta rays, and dolphins. The other tour takes you into the mangrove swamp area where you will see the alligators, snakes and other critters of the swamp. Both are really good.Shark Valley is located on the Tamiami Trail and is only about a mile from the turn off. The entrance fee here is also $20/car. This is a smaller facility but is still very nice. The Shark Valley Visitor Center offers a tram ride which takes through the park and also shows you a variety of birds and swamp critters associated withe Everglades. The ride is narrated by the typical, extremely professional and knowledgeable U.S Park Rangers. This is a really nice outing for the entire family. Tip: If you don't have time or the tram is booked, go to the right, facing the visitor center form the parking lot, and walk down the paved path beside canal. You will see all kinds of alligators, snapping turtles, fish, Snake Birds swimming underwater looking for food, and other critters of the swamp.Everglades National park is a national treasure!.

It's a good job somebody cared enough to protect this fragile and fascinating ecosystem from all the property developers. We went on some short hikes (the park is best enjoyed by boat of some sort), some of which were flooded due to recent heavy rains, tried a boat trip from the Gulf Coast visitors centre (Mangrove wilderness - highly recommended) and drove along a scenic route through the Big Cypress preserve, which was full of gators. In fact, the entire Everglades region is teeming with life (some of which want to suck your blood, be sure to bring DEET, not garlic). We saw so many alligators, some up close, some just hanging out in the water, even baby ones, plus many birds, couple of turtles, dolphins, crabs, even a snake. The park also has many back country opportunities for those who wish to explore in canoe or kayak.Overall a fascinating and unique national park.","December 19, 2015",The REAL Florida,30,"New Hamburg, Canada",5

Everglades National Park,"It's been said that there is only one Everglades. So true! It is unlike any other National Park I have ever visited (and there have been quite a few). Sadly, this unique ecosystem only been partly saved by the environmental interests. Before you visit, I highly recommend reading ""The Swamp"" by Michael Grunwald. It gives you the background to fully understand the forces that worked against this unique place (for decades). There is basically one road through the Park. It connects Homestead to Flamingo. There are several visitor centers that provide a wide variety of educational resources. One can arrange a Park sponsored boat trip up the Buttonwood Canal, to mention just one. There are numerous nature trails near the visitor's centers. Warning: Don't make your visit brief and don't go there just to fish. Take the time to explore the last great wetlands in the USA. They say that the effort to ""save the 'glades may be too little too late. Go. Learn. Experience. You will not forget the saw grass, the mangroves and the cypress trees when you get back home. The landscape will linger in your mind for a long time.One more thing: Don't go there thinking you're going to see a ""swamp"". It isn't a swamp.

But when you are on vacation, you don't get to choose your weather, you have to work with it. So we set out in our car for the park, and bought a $2 rain park in plastic, to guard against the rain. I recommend the bug spray as well. We took the back country boat tour. The Captain and boat hand were incredibly knowledgeable. The smell, the sounds and the sights of this ancient place are something that must be experienced. And it is only here that you can experience this unique ecosystem, this river of grass. If you come to Florida, you should come here. In this state of unnatural wonders (Disney world, a man-made fantasy world) the natural wonders and far more amazing.

Everglades National Park,"First, there are FOUR Visitor centers, the park is so huge - like 40 miles by 30 miles, most of it inaccessible. Two of the visitor centers are out of the Homestead AFB area (Florida City), at the start and terminus of a long 25 mile road, starting at Ernest F Coe Visitor Center, ending at Flamingo Visitor Center. We visited Shark Valley, 20 miles on the northern boundary between Miami and Naples. The fourth is the Gulf Coast center south of Naples. Most of the reviews unknowingly are talking about only ONE of these centers. This is an AWESOME place. I can only speak for ""Shark Valley"" center, which is focused on a 15-mile road into the heart of the everglades prarie, accessible by park tram or bicycle or walking. The end of the road has a 45-foot tower for viewing. It is a real view of the bonafide everglades, NOT mangroves (salt water) or air boat rides. Not for thrills, but for folks who love nature, and want to understand and 'feel' the story behind this incredible, thousands of square miles, huge sheet of slow-moving water, it's animals, and it's degradation and hopefully semi-restoral. You are in Shark Valley to see the prarie of grasses, hummocks, birds, alligators, and all animals in their natural habitat - so sometimes you see lots, sometimes not so much. We only saw two alligators - but were struck by the awesome nature of the entire place. Best time to see animals is dry season - winter - because then they focus on remaining water areas, some of which are by the tram road.

Everglades National Park,What a great place to visit. We were there in April during the dry season. But there was still plenty of wildlife to see. Being nature photographers this was a highlight of our 3 week trip in Florida. We stayed in Key Largo when we visited the East side and went all the way down to Flamingo. Saw lots of birds and Alligators. While in Flamingo we got some great pictures of Salt Water Crocodiles which are hard to photograph in there natural environment. The next day we did the north side of the park off of the Tamiami Trail. Shark Valley is a must see. Take the tram or hike out to the Shark Valley Observation Tower. There are walking trails and boardwalks that are wheelchair accessible. There is a loop road off of the Tamaimi Trail in the Big Cypress Preserve that is dirt but well worth the trip. Stop at the visitor center on the Trail for a self guided tour pamphlet and to check on current road conditions. We stayed in Chokoloskee at the Parkway Motel & Marina on the West side for 3 days. This allowed us to explore the Big Cypress Preserve and the Thousand Island region of the Park. We did the Loop road and Janes Scenic Drive in Big Cypress. The next day we hired a guide Captin Bruce Hitchcock who took us out in the Thousand Island region of the park. It was a combination fishing and birding tour. It was one of the high lights of our trip. Captain Bruce was great we caught fish and he took us to some rookeries were we took pictures of a lifetime. And gave us a back country tour. Can't wait to go out with him again. His boat set up is great! It was very easy to get in and out of with the lift that he uses.

Everglades National Park,"We spent 2 days in the Everglades NP. One day we went to Shark Valley and took the tram tour. I think they should run trams more often but it was a great way to see an area that is a 15 miles long trail. Biking is a great option too but it was too hot for us. We walked a little too and saw a momma gator and her 40 about a month old hatchlings right next to road in the grass. It was amazing to see this in a season that is slow but it shows you there is always something to see. A NP ranger said the gators give birth in early Sept so our timing was perfect for this. We saw several turtles and a few early migrant birds but we're told Feb is best month to most birds and animals. Down the road on highway 41 we went on an air boat tour and that was fun too. They are not allowed to do this inside the NP and were told the operators own the land and Everglades that they run these tours on.Next day we went to another entrance, Ernest Coe entrance. This is the main entrance to the park and has a nice visitors center. Here there is a great little movie and rangers to explain the park in detail. Here there is a nice boardwalk that takes you out over the Everglades- we saw several gators including a kill. 5 gators and one got a bird then swam right past us - great area for photos but you must be patient since it is hard to see them camouflaged and very still. We then saw 3 gators set into a battle of space. Great place to see wildlife but it is hot and no shade.

This walk is very short, but includes a rise in elevation to a platform you can view the Everglades from. We saw numerous birds here; several were feeding in the shallow water.

Everglades National Park,"We were initially skeptical about visiting the Everglades in September (wet season) as reviewers said that it is hot and humid and there are too many mosquitoes. But I am glad we went! After our visit to the Keys, we finished up in the Everglades. We first went to the Royal Palms visitor Center and did the Anhinga Trail. It was a short trail, and we spotted a mama gator and her little babies and two more gators. Also, several soft shelled turtles and vultures and fish. I believe in the dry season you see much more wildlife than the wet season but we enjoyed it nevertheless. Surprisingly, there was a cool breeze blowing and it was a pretty comfortable day. Probably, because the rain was coming. We didn't encounter any mosquitoes on this trail. In fact, we were felt overdressed in our long sleeved tops and long pants while everyone else were in tiny shorts and sleeveless tops. But the ranger told us that the Gumbo Limbo trail would have mosquitoes as it has dense vegetation. After this trail, we drove to the Shark Valley entrance and took the two hour tram tour. It's a nice option for those short on time like us. We spotted several mama gators and plenty of babies and egrets and blue herons. The guide was excellent and she said in dry season there are hundreds of gators closer to the road. The lookout tower was nice. At this stop, there were many mosquitoes. At the visitor center, you can learn more about gators and the difference between gators and crocs, more about turtles and other wildlife.

OK; there´s so much to do in the Sunshine State, however, we love the alligators along the road and even manatees in the Flamingo harbor.If you plan a whole day in the Everglades, start your day driving thru to Flamingo, get a coffee at the convenience store and ""do the Everglades the other way"".Most tourists start at Ernest F. Coe visitor center and drive from north to south - effect: Flamingo might get crowded in the afternoon.

Everglades National Park,"We visited at a bad time because of potential hurricane Erika. We followed the gps to an entrance to the park. It turned out to be an area no longer in use but the gates were open. We called the number for the Ernest Coe visitor center for help because the gps could not find that listed address of 40001 State Road 9336. Homestead FL. The male that answered the phone kept asking where I was. I gave him the address and described the location. He kept repeating he had no idea where I was and put a female on the phone. She again said she didn't know where I was but she was sure i wouldn't get to the center until after it closed! I asked for a GPS address and was told by her that all gps are different so just follow the brown signs to the park. I told her i only saw 1 sign and now i am at a deserted area. She responded that she didn't know about that and i needed to follow the brown signs. She also kept repeating that the entire park would be closed at 6pm sharp because of the hurricane. I asked if the park was closing today. She repeated it was closing at 6pm sharp. I asked if that was today. She finally said no it was at 6 pm the next day. So after receiving no help from the employees to find the visitor center, we played with the gps and got directions by putting in state road 9336 Homestead FL. Don't put in the 40001 part of the address! When we got to the park the visitor center had closed 10 minutes earlier of course. We checked the big maps displayed in the parking. On the map was the initial location that we went to and it showed it had picnicking there. That location was about 5 miles from the visitor center and the address was on the map yet the park employees kept saying they didn't know where we were!! Very aggravating. If they would have said to use the state road only for the GPS address we would have been there 20 minutes before the center closed. We drove the 38 mile one way trip from the visitor center to the end of the road at the Flamingo visitor center. It is August and it seems their season for activities is November through April so there was nothing going on. It was a boring ride of tall grass and trees. Same thing we saw on the way to the tip of Florida. Can say we have been there but that is the best thing we can say about the park. The Smokey Mountains were much prettier and had a lot of interesting waterfalls and land features. I guess it all depends on what you expect to see.","September 1, 2015",Park employees not helpful,9,"Cedar Hill, Missouri",3

It was an enjoyable way to spend a couple hours of the day (travel plus tour). While the cost may be a bit steep (approximately $42 per adult), there is not any other way to see large alligators up close and personal.

We entered at Ernest Coe Visitor Center and drove the entire 38 mile drive to Flamingo Visitor Center where we took a boat tour.We stopped at all the trails and did the ""hikes"", which were actually mild strolls. The first, and best, was the Ahinga Trail. We spent about an hour walking this .8 mile loop and saw several alligators, turtles, birds, and weird, colorful grasshopper like critters. Really a lot of fun. We also did the Gumbo Limbo Trail which was in that turn-off as well. That was just okay - a short walk through dense forest with odd trees.We saw an alligator on the side of the road as we drove to our next trail, the Pinelands. Saw a couple of small lizards, but you're out of the swamp now and into the piney woods. We pulled into 4-5 other short trails and walked them but they were nothing spectacular that day. Maybe later in the afternoon you may see some wildlife but only the flies and gnats were out for us.We got to our boat tour and took a 1:45 minute cruise through the mangroves and out across some bay. It wasn't what we expected - I thought we'd be deep in the swamp - but it was fun nonetheless. We saw a couple of baby crocodiles hanging out, one large croc swimming in the channel, and a family of dolphins followed us for awhile. It was mostly trees and history.

Got to see a few dolphins and lots of birds. My favorite trails were the Anhinga trail and Mahogany Hammock. I wish we had had time for the Shark Valley tram tour, as my mom did it several years ago and says it's amazing.

Everglades National Park,This was a very disappointing river trip. The guide was very informative but what was to be seen and the experience of having horse flies and deer flies biting us during the trip marred anything that we might learn during the experience. I do not recommend wasting your time and money on this part of your experience during your stay in the park.,"May 30, 2015",Disappointed with the water trip in the park,6,"Corvallis, Oregon",2
Everglades National Park,"Go to the visitors center before you go into the Everglades. Pick up a map. It has a lot of information on it and shows where all the best places are to stop. Plenty of exhibits to look at , especially for school trips.There is a small charge to enter the park but it lasts a few days.We enjoyed the walk around Anhinga trail and the wooded walk at Mahogany hammock. We were a bit disappointed with Flamingo. But we were visiting at the start of the season.Still worth a visit.","May 29, 2015",Great information at the Visitors center,117,"Woking, United Kingdom",4

Everglades National Park,"Husband and I just got back from our stay in Miami Beach. Took the drive to ENP, from Homestead to Flamingo. We saw tons of wildlife and not many people. The mosquitos were not back until the heat of the day. Spent about half the day stopping at many of the trails. Remember to bring water and food- there is no food vendor other than the Marina in Flamingo, which only has refridgerated microwavable sandwiches and snacks. It was a great day! We stopped at Robert is Here afterward and grabbed some great shakes too. Recommended for families and couples of all ages IMO.","May 22, 2015",Great Trip!,74,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",4

Everglades National Park,"Three of us visited the Park in search of several hard to find bird species. Just after paying the Park entrance fee you have an 18 mile drive to the Flamingo Visitor Center.Our first stop was approx. 1.1 miles past the turn-off for Mahogany Hammocks where we saw the Seaside Sparrow off in the tall grasses on either side of the road. We made a short but ill-fated trip down Snake Bight Train looking for the Mangrove Cuckoo but were drive back by hordes of mosquitos. We saw the White-crowned Pigeon near the 9 Mile Ponds. After a long wait the Brown-headed Cowbirds started to appear (almost noon) and among them there were three Shiny Cowbirds which was our target. Success! Looking out into the water from the Center there was a nice mudflat and we saw a Marbled Godwit.We hiked several other areas (West Lake, Eco Ponds) and time flew by. It is easy to spend a whole day at the Park.The Park Superintendent said they are hoping to bring in a Concessionaire next year to provide Food and Lodging.

Everglades National Park,"May is definitely the wrong month, to visit the Everglades; even the rangers said it to us, but of course it was then too late...All the migratory birds and most of the manatees had already left, so we saw very little wildlife. Due to high outside temperatures, we could only walk either early in the morning or late in the afternoon. In many of the park's trails we had to fight with mosquitoes, even after having sprayed us with repellant (50% DEET, which as far as we know, is the maximum possible concentration). We had planned to visit for at least two days, instead we ran away after one","May 20, 2015",Never again in May!,156,"Milan, Italy",2

Everglades National Park,"Went to Key Largo with an adult daughter, and we decided to take a look at the Everglades National Park. What a nice surprise! We took a boat tour at the Flamingo area of the Everglades and it was well worth it. I was amazed to see the large lakes and jungle-like mangrove areas - nothing like what you see on TV. Walking the trails and boardwalks at dusk was great (and a little spooky) they have alligators, you know.... This may have been the highlight of a quick trip to the Keys!","May 18, 2015",A highlight of our Key Largo Trip,10,"Frederick, Colorado",5
Everglades National Park,"A graet park for seeing a lot in relatively short walks. If seeing the southern end, be sure to attend one of the ranger walks. We spotted alligators, soft & hard shell turtles, so many species of birds, bromiliads, and learned of the nesting habits from the ranger. The boat ride gave us further information about the flora and fauna and was very pleasant, with views of crocodiles and alligators throughout.The next day, our walk in the park at the northern entrance was cut short because we missed the last tram & learned that you may remain if you park outside the gat in a designated area. No much within the park to eat but you won't starve, either. Just plan on picnic benches.","May 18, 2015",Loved the opportunities for up close views of birds & creatures,11,"Boise, Idaho, United States",4

Upon the advice on the web we skipped the Airboats and went for the tram ride in the park at Shark Valley and loved it. The tour guide was very informative and we saw LOTS of gators.

Everglades National Park,"The road from Naples to Homestead where we stayed overnight on our way to The Keys was long and very straight, but it went right through the Everglades. We stopped at the Information Centres and the one called ""Oasis"" was amazing, with a stretch of river full of alligators, accessible by a walk way and we got some great photos. There were very unusual road signs all the way, such as ""panthers crossing"" and one of the information centres had information on the panthers which was interesting.

Since a storm a few years back there is no accommodation so you have a long, long drive from the park entrance to take any trips.

You may want to take an umbrella, every time I am there it is is either pouring or super hot and the umbreela would have been useful for sunshade.

Everglades National Park,"We spent an entire day doing a guided tour of western Everglades locations. We booked through Viator but the actual tour was a local outfit, something like ""Everglades Eco-tours"". Our tour guide was terrific. The tour included a stop at Fakahatchee Strand Preserve State Park to do the nature walk, then on to Everglades City where we got a boat ride around the 10,000 Islands area, then lunch in E-City with fried alligator snacks to taste (grouper sandwich was very tasty), then upcountry, past Fakahatchee and the Panther park to Lake Trafford where we got an airboat ride and saw tons of alligators and birds. Florida is really a birder's paradise. We made a quick stop along the way to see a stork rookery (big lot of storks!). Some years ago, maybe 40 or more, I had occasion to visit Everglades and do the road from Florida City side down to Flamingo and back, and I remember that as being really terrific. It's on my bucket list for next trip to south Florida. I can't say enough good about the Everglades, no matter what part of it you visit.

Everglades National Park,"What a wonderful national park this is. We spent about a week here total, counting 4 nights staying in Homestead (east side of the park) and 3 nights in Everglades City (west side of the park). We visited all 4 Visitor Centers, which were helpful and well done. I especially enjoyed the Royal Palm center with many informative displays. From near there we walked on the fascinating Anhinga trail which allowed easy sighting of both many birds and alligators. I took a (free) guided bird walk in Florida City which was terrific; I saw 5 life birds and the leader was exceptional. There are many free activities offered once you have paid your park entrance fee. We drove the Tamiami Trail over to the western side of the park stopping at The Shark Valley center with more interesting displays and wildlife. At the Everglades City entrance we took a boat ride out into the 10,000 islands, a totally different experience than at the other sites. We are so lucky to have this wonderful park protected and preserved for all to see at minimal cost.","April 20, 2015",Fantastic wildlife experience,64,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5

Everglades National Park,We have visited the Everglades National Park many times over the years. We see something new in nature on every visit. The visitor center at the entrance is informative and will give you information to plan your visit. The Anhinga Trail is an easy walk with wildlife and plants along the marsh. The drive to Flamingo from the park entrance is 40 miles and so it can be a long day unless you are camping at Flamingo. At Flamingo you can take a boat tour along the waterway and see the wildlife and flora up close. One needs a few days to really explore the park. There are many trails to walk but there are also spots along the drive where you can pause and look at nature.,"April 19, 2015",Wonderful natural treasure !,58,Pennsylvania,5
Everglades National Park,"We had just a day, so we started at the visitor centre (the multimedia video is worthwhile) then to the various trails where we saw a variety of wildlife and flora. At the end of the road, Flamingo wasn't much, but there are crocodiles to see there, a restaurant and a VERY well air conditioned shop to buy your ice creams, snacks etc.Our visit was in the dry season so there were no vistas of grasses shimmering in the water, but there were magnificent views around nonetheless.","April 16, 2015",Lots of things to see,79,"Surrey, England",5

The Anahiga Trail is a must-do. An abundance of wildlife appeared along the trail -- multiple waterbirds, alligators galore, turtles, hawks, schools of fish, all within the first 50 feet of the walk! Even our teenager enjoyed it. Walk through the canopy of trees, to experience shade and solitude. We didn't have time to see the other sites in the Park but will definitely return to do so.","April 13, 2015",Impressive!,21,"Kingsville, Maryland",5

Everglades National Park,"Lots of little trails to hike, as well as some longer ones, also canoe trails to do and can even kayak overnite for one to several days depending on your desire. The boat tour was worth the price, with a guide that answers all questions, gives an interesting speech thruout the ride about history, the local fauna and flora, really is able to point out hard to see animals, and will maneuver the boat to make sure that everyone gets to see what he is pointing out. Saw crocodiles, american alligators, birds galore, and lots of mangroves. A great place to spend a day or a week. If there just for the day, go early in the morning to get most of the day in there.

We just enjoyed the drive through the park and some of the walkways and observation decks they have at various locations. At one area, Cindy spotted a momma owl and her chick sitting in a tree near the parking lot. Mom was sleeping but the fuzzy little chick seemed as interested in us as we were in him/her.

Everglades National Park,"We rushed to catch an excursion boat on the Flamingo end of the park. Saw coots, two tiny 'gators and an ibis on the boat trip. Saw more at the plug and on the grounds after the boat excursion, including BIG 'gators and manatee. The best part was the Anhinga trail. This alone was worth the price of admission ($10 each). Many gators, and the best variety of birds we've ever seen on a trail ... ANYWHERE. The only negative was insensitive tourists from other countries who were loud and disruptive. They seemed to think they were at Disneyland, instead of a wildlife preserve, giggling, talking loudly and SCREAMING. ","March 29, 2015",Anhinga trail the best part,82,"Hayward, WI",4
Everglades National Park,"The Everglades did not disappoint! We stopped in the Everglades on our way to see the Key Deer, and I wished we could have stayed longer. It is a bird paradise. I was able to see so many amazing species up close (varies hawks, woodpeckers, pelicans, eagles, kites, owls, etc.)! If for whatever reason you forget your bird book, stop in the Flamingo Visitor Center. The park rangers there are extremely knowledgeable on the varies bird species and are able to provide you with a possible early morning bird hike and a bird species pamphlet. The number of people varied in the park, and it seemed dependent upon how close you were to the park entrance (closer to the entrance, more people). Even in crowded areas, most people would get out and take a picture and be on their way leaving the trails/hikes to those interested in examining the vegetation and wildlife. PS. Something extremely cool and unexpected. My sister and I wanted to stay out late to see some nocturnal species (for example, we saw a bobcat), but we were in for a reptile treat. Apparently late a night, the main highway becomes the local hangout for many of the snake species! What a thrill. Just be careful if you decide to get out and take pics. Some of the species were non-venomous, but we did run into a couple that could have cost a helicopter ride to the hospital for anti-venom. Also, drive slow! This guys aren't as fast as your car, and we saw at least 4 or 5 dead because they were hit by a vehicle.","March 26, 2015",Everglades- Beauty of Southern Florida,1,"Hattiesburg, Mississippi",5

Gumbo limbo was interesting and easy to walk, the roads are all paved or wooded.we also drove to Flamingo, liked it less because no wildlife except vultures, but nice trails too... of course if you have a canoe it becomes amazing, but we stayed on the ground .all in all a must do , this ecosystem is truly unique .","March 21, 2015",wonderful experience,196,"Siena, Italy",5

Everglades National Park,"We traveled here with our seven boys (12 to 8 months). The Anhinga trail was definitely the highlight. There were a lot of birds, turtles, fish and alligators to see along way. It's short and wasn't a problem for any of our crew. Outside of this area we had trouble keeping our kids interested. We visited the Mahogany Hammock trail and by then our kids were ready to call it quits and head for the swimming pool. If you're going to visit here with kids here are my tips: get on a tour, bring lots of water (it's hot), you're going to be in the sun a lot so prepare. We didn't feel like we did enough educational preparation to make the Everglades as interesting as possible. ","March 18, 2015",Wildlife Abounds,20,"Irondequoit, New York",3
Everglades National Park,"The Everglades has 2 primarily roads. From Florida City or Homestead you can drive just a few miles to a park entrance and follow road 9336 all the way to Flamingo Point. Along the way we found the Coe visitor center, just as you enter the park, to be a worthwhile stop, not just for the exhibits inside but also for the outside walkways where plenty of birds and gators can be seen. If you drive further on 9336 toward Flamingo be sure to stop by Mahogany Hammock and take the short walk on an elevated platform thru an amazing variety of vegetation. For Flamingo either take a lunch or plan on burgers (if opened) at the only dinning place in the building on your right (west) as you head toward the water.The second major road for the Glades is scenic Highway 41 bordering the park's north side. Alone the way you'll find Shark Valley a favorite because there are long walkways, taken either by foot, on your own bike or by tram ($$$) with plenty of gators and birds to be seen up close along the way. And if you are into airboats skimming the Glades you'll plenty to chose from along Highway 41 as you head toward Naples.","March 18, 2015",2 Different Roads - 9336 and Highway 41,37,"Tucson, Arizona",4

Everglades National Park,"We tent camped at Everglades National Park, Florida City. We spent four nights and had a great time. We were there in early March of 2015 and it was HOT. Temps were in the very high 80's and very humid to boot. We were glad to finally get some heat during our visit to Fl. St. Augustine had been unusually cold. We saw lots of alligators during our trip and lots and lots of beautiful birds of all colors and sizes. Our campsite was good and provided us plenty of space. 40 % deet Deep Woods Off kept the mosquitoes off of us most of the time. We used a whole can for four nights and five days there. Be prepared when you arrive with yours too.","March 17, 2015",Had a Great Visit,41,"Drummond Island, Michigan",5
Everglades National Park,"This park is great in so many ways! One of the best features is that you can usually see both alligators and crocodiles on the same visit. I recommend you start at the visitor center to get your bearings and view the informational displays, but don't linger because there's so much nature to see. Next, walk the Anhinga Trail, which is located just beyond the entrance gate (where you pay). Many of the birds are accustomed to people and you can get a close-up view of cormorants, anhingas, and herons. Keep an eye on the trees, too, because you might see an anhinga nesting in a tree over the water. The trail is a loop, but it has a spur trail that leads to a lookout point, where I saw 17 alligators hauled out, plus a turtle. It's a short trail and will take less than an hour, even if you take it real slow. Next, drive the 30+ miles through the park, looking at the different habitats, and go all the way to the Flamingo boat launch. There is a marina on the left where you can buy pre-packaged sandwiches and drinks. In back of this building is a little bridge. An osprey was feeding 2 chicks in a nest on a post at the entrance to the bridge; we were probably only 20 feet from the nest; quite exciting. We were able to walk about 1/2 way across the bridge and we could see the alligators on the bank; they were hauled out sunning themselves. You can also take a boat ride at this location, but you may need reservations.","March 17, 2015",Alligators and Crocodiles,2,"Amarillo, Texas",5

Everglades National Park,"Toward the end of our visit, we drove past an Alligator sunning himself on the side of the road: a perfect climax to the visit. we were there in the dry season, so there's much less standing water than many guide books show, so don't be disappointed if you see don't see vast sheets of water. It's still worth seeing.The brochures at the park entrance describe the different side roads from the main road that ends at Flamenco bay.If you are short of time the Royal Palm stop near the entrance has two short trails, Anhinga, and Gumbo Limbo, which between them have plenty of alligators and birds. Well worth the visit to the park.If you have time, drive to the bay, and see the full expanse of the park, stopping at other sideroads on the way. In the dry season the Pa-hay-okee overlook faces the deepest park of the park, which it has the best chance of being covered in water, depending on the recent rains. You can see a dense mangrove stand at the West Lake Canoe Trail stop (listed on the canoe side of the brochure), which has a boardwalk through a mangrove stand to the bay.","March 16, 2015",This is the Everglades,98,"Jacksonville, Florida",5

I took photos to remind me to not go that way again.","March 14, 2015",Not what I expected,12,"Wooster, Arkansas",2

At the visitors center you can get a list of what is going on and when. We were fortunate enough to hit a ranger tour and couple of speakers. The rest of the day we tried to follow the map we had...just not enough daylight. Were I to do this again from scratch would get a room at Florida City and get to the 'Glades early with plan in hand. I'm not a big camper or outdoorsman but you cannot be less than amazed by all of the plants and animals everywhere. Thinking of the past you wonder how early explorers and soldiers were able to accomplish any thing worth while in that terrain. There is much food for thought there so, again, I say allow plenty of time and take advantage of this wonderfully interesting park.","March 8, 2015",Allow plenty of time and schedule ahead,115,Point Pleasant,5
Everglades National Park,"We spent some time in the ""real"" Everglades -- that is, within the actual park boundaries from the entrance near Florida City/Homestead, Florida. Compared to the hub-bub of the adjacent commercial areas, the park is an oasis of natural calm. We did a ranger-led walk that we would highly recommend, and we spent time on our own on the boardwalks that meander through a small section of the park. The wildlife sightings of birds and reptiles were plentiful and close-up. Probably because we were on their ""turf"", they were pretty casual about being observed, so we got very good looks at a number of species that we would normally see only in short glimpses, in captivity, or otherwise not at all.The first alligator sighting was an event exceeded only by the sight of dozens of them basking in the sun near a boardwalk lookout point.There is very limited access to the park and minimal paved surfaces within, so we followed what road there is to Flamingo where we saw manatee and crocodile. All-in-all it was a very good experience, perhaps even more so, because it was so much better than we had expected.","March 7, 2015",a gem among the air boat rides,34,"Riverwoods, Illinois",5
Everglades National Park,"This stretch of back roads through the Everglades was the best ride in all of Florida in my book. Loved that we could see so much wildlife at our own pace on our own time as we enjoyed the landscape. The Birds were Amazing! The Alligator & Crocadile were very plentiful along the way. After seeing ""Panther Crossing"" signs, I was hoping to get to see one, but we didn't. We weren't even aware that Florida had them. That was just one of the several things we learned along the way on that trip. If you can, surely take the time to visit this area. We will surely go back through on our next trip.","March 7, 2015",We did a Road Trip through this place before our return flight back to Maine,110,"South China, Maine",4
Everglades National Park,We have been to the park several times over the years and enjoyed seeing the wildlife. This time we were fortunate to take a tour of the former Nike missile site. The guide has done a lot of background reading and our tour had a veteran who actually worked at this site. There is much to see including an actual missile. Check the Everglades NP website to find times and availability of tours and be aware there is a good amount of walking in the Florida sun.

Everglades National Park,"With only one day to experience the Everglades, we wanted to see as much and learn as much as possible. We chose the Shark Valley Tram Tours, and it was perfect. Park admission was $10. Tours were $21.49 (I think that was with a AAA or AARP discount). We had reserved a 2 p.m. tour, but when we arrived there were four spots left on the 1 p.m. tour (which can not be reserved ahead) so we took it. The tram consisted of two cars, with the guide in the front car but an excellent sound system so we heard everything just fine in the second car. Our guide was EXCELLENT. She was just bursting with knowledge and enthusiasm. I was surprised to find out at the end of the tour (1 1/2-2 hours) that she was not employed by the National Park Service but instead worked for tips, and she received many from the travelers on our tour. The Everglades themselves are a treasure that we all need to protect, especially from the invasive (and very large - so glad we didn't actually see one) snakes. Saw lots of alligators and birds. The park ranger inside the lodge was also very knowledgeable. We enjoyed the whole experience.","March 3, 2015",Best Way to See the Everglades,38,"Hayfield, Minnesota",5

The trails are easy for everyone and either paved or a boardwalk so you don't have to watch where you are walking, you can just look around you. A huge variety of birds that sit still no matter how close people come with their cameras. Very photogenic!! Plenty of bathroom facilities. The drive to Flamingo Visitor Center is worth it as the Florida Bay with all the little islands is very beautiful. Look for manatees in the boat launch area! We ate at the restaurant at Flamingo.

We then drove to the Flamingo Visitor Center and were very disappointed in the appearance and cleanliness of he buildings. We took a Back Country boat ride ride from the marina which was $32 per person and we saw little if any wildlife and the guide shared info about trees and snakes but little else.

They provide canvas covers for your car, to prevent vultures scratching the paintwork, and there were plenty of them (vultures, not cars).Elsewhere we had less luck, driving all the way to Eco pond and the Flamingo trail to see…. mosquitos, but sadly precious little else.

The entrance fee was $10 a car and they prefer credit cards. The drive is short to the visitor's center which has a bathroom, gift store, guide center and the Tram. The facilities have a water bottle fountain and the gift store has bottled water and other drinks for purchase along with a few snacks. The gift store has fun gifts like magnets and shot glasses as well as shirts and sports bottles and a few necessities like sun block - much needed! We received a park map at the entrance which is helpful in identifying plants and animals living in the Everglades.There are 3 paths that can be walked 2 short ones and a 15 mile path the trams travel along. We opted to walk almost half the 15 mile path which is flat, paved and right out in the Florida sun. The tram or bicycles may have been a better option since there is an observation tower at the halfway mark - we did not make it that far. However by walking we were able to see more of the plants and animals up close rather than on a crowed tram. Just remember, once committed to walking the long path there are no seating or picnic areas and the walk back is however long the walk forward was before turning back. I highly recommend visiting the Everglades National Park if you have at least a half a day to spend enjoying nature.

Time permitting, you may even want to consider Big Cypress preserve, which is right next door to Shark Valley. Try to go out earlier in the morning, when there are fewer crowds and the birds are more active. Stand still or sit on a bench and wait 10-20 minutes for the creatures to come out. Bring binoculars, your camera phone won't have enough zoom to adequately capture the birds.","February 5, 2015",Best enjoyed over multiple days,90,"New Haven, CT",5
Everglades National Park,"Visiting Everglades National Park in the dry season (winter/spring) allows a person to see an abundance of wildlife, including alligators, that congregate around water. Our first stop after entering the park was to take the short Anhinga Trail. The variety of birds we observed here was just amazing. They were totally unafraid of us tourists so we could observe them close up. We even saw an Anhinga catch a fish. Schools of fish could easily be seen from the path along with turtles. Any then there were alligators ... everywhere! There was one spot where we counted 20 in one place. By the end of the walk it was sort of ""Oh just another gator"". This walk is all level, on asphalt or boardwalk. There are benches along the way to rest or sit and observe the wildlife. If this was the only thing a person did in Everglades Park, they could be very satisfied.","February 4, 2015","Oh another gator, and another, and another, and ...",25,,5

Everglades National Park,"Though this national park lacks the majesty or awe inspiring views of some of the parks out west or along the Blue Ridge Mountains it is none the less one of this country's national jewels. It is a vast sub tropical wilderness where minute changes in elevation totally change the ecosystem...six inches higher pinelands,six inches lower fresh water marsh. It's geographic location puts temperate and tropical flora next to each other,it contains more than 400 species of migratory and year round birds,over 50 different species of reptiles and an array of mammals including the rare Florida panther and the gentle manatee. It is the only place in the world where the habitats of the crocodile and alligator overlap. For first time visitors a stop at the visitor center is highly recommended and if your time is limited the one stop not to be missed is the Anhinga trail at the Royal Palm area just a few miles after the park's main entrance. The Gumbo Limbo trail in this same area will have you feeling like if you'd just entered a tropical jungle,in reality an elevated tree island known locally as a hammock. With more time I suggest you do the entire park road all the way to Flamingo stopping along the way to walk the trails so as to intimately experience the different ecosystems that the Everglades has to offer.

After that we went further into the park, each other trail was a lot less crowded, but there was less to see. Still gorgeous scenery, just not a big exciting animal every where you looked.

Everglades National Park,"A perfect way to escape the hustle and bustle of southern Florida. When you enter, make sure to visit the Ernest Coe Visitor Center. You'll get a map and find out which attractions and guided walks interest you, and the staff there is very helpful and friendly. Most people go to the Anhinga Trail in the Royal Palm area. It's close to the entrance, and has the most wildlife to see - if you only have an hour or two make this your first stop. The Anhinga Trail is utterly amazing: there are so many birds and alligators you won't believe it, all in their natural environment. We went when a ranger was giving a 45-minute guided tour of the trail, which was excellent. You learn and understand so much more when a knowledgeable guide leads the way! We saw about 15 gators and dozens of interesting birds, which alone was worth the trip.We also visited the Mahogany Hammock and the Pa-hay-okee Overlook. Both are worth visiting, although there wasn't much wildlife to see. The Mahogany Hammock is just about halfway through the park road, and we didn't have enough time to go to the end, where there are lots more things to see. But still, for $10 per carload, this place is a bargain, especially compared to those commercial tourist traps which display their captive alligators for the crowds to gawk at.

Most impressive was the number of Alligators that we saw and again up close and personal. They ranger walk was extremely informative and pointed out things you would normally miss.

If you find one that contains deet to keep mosquitoes away during seasons with problems, go ahead and protect yourself. My visit did not have mosquitoes issues. The area is very flat and birds are abundant. Small children will pretty much only appreciate looking at the alligators. The environment is not very interesting to tiny kids. The roads are too fast for bicycling along for families with children riders. This park is best appreciated by folks who can be very still and hear well. When still you can perceive little crunching noises around you and therefore be able to find the live critters in your area.

Everglades National Park,"I have been blessed to visit the Everglades National Park a number of times. This time I concentrated on the Anhinga Trail just inside the park's boundary. This trail includes a paved path and a boardwalk over the glades. The alligators outnumbered the anhingas this day--perhaps the trail should be renamed. Anhingas are the fascinating birds that dive and swim under water to catch fish. Then, they must sit on a bush and spread their wings to dry. Blue herons, egrets, and coots were among the other birds present. Benches along the boardwalk provide places to sit and listen to the sounds of the glades. Many gators had chosen to work on their tans along side the water. One very close to the paved path afforded a close-up look. In this area the gators are used to seeing people, but don't be careless! They are not tame. Maintenance of our national parks is seriously underfunded as evidenced by the building at the beginning of the trail. We must insure that these treasures are preserved for the enjoyment and edification of generations to come.","January 18, 2015",A Treasure to Preserve,62,Willow Street,5
Everglades National Park,"Our trip was split into two separate parts. The first was an airboat ride around Lake Trafford where we saw an amazing variety and quantity of birds and also a profusion of alligators. The setting was very natural with us being the only boat on the lake at the time. It is well worth the trip from Naples.We then based ourselves in Florida City which is very convenient to visit the park. The Visitor Centre is well worth a visit as they have loads of information and the rangers were very helpful. We paid 10US$ for a pass for multiple entry into all of the trails for the following 7 days, amazing value. The must see are the Anhinga Trail which is only a few miles from the park entrance and also Flamingo Bay which is about 40 miles further on. Both have amazing walks with a huge variety of wild life especially birds but Flamingo also has crocs.

We did see a crocodile which is always cool to see in Florida and remember that this is one of the few places in the world were both crocodiles and gators live. We did walk on some paved paths. Anhinga Trail is always a good stop to see birds. It was also hilarious to see the vulture that now vandalize cars (first time that we have been here and seen this). The park provides blue tarps to cover and protect guest cars, but these tarps seem to attract the buzzards more. They also seem to target the most expensive cars in the parking lot. So leave your Mercedes at home. Also, if you are going to Flamingo make sure to eat lunch first. They only have pre-packaged nasty sandwiches that are really expensive.

We were advised that a Ranger would be giving a walking tour at the Anhinga Trail, so we headed to Royal Palm for that. Highly recommend this. We had Ranger Rick, who was very informative and good natured. So glad we did this rather than self-guiding on this trail. Tour is at no cost and unlike other attractions in FL, no tip is requested afterwards. After spending about an hour on this trail we headed up to the Shark Valley Loop Rd. We ended up stopping at the Everglades Safari Park for an Airboat tour. We did not make it to the loop or any other ENP trails or sites, but friends recommended the Loop drive.

This area has an excellent boardwalk that goes out into the glades and gives a really great view of the glades and the wildlife. Gators are everywhere as well as turtles, cormorants, exotic moorhens, green backed herons along with very large various freshwater tropical fish.

Everglades National Park,"This is an approximately 50 mile road. Along the road there are about a half dozen side roads to park and see different aspects of the glades. Bring food and drink. There are some vending machines here but that's about it until you get to Flamingo which is the end of the road. And then, you may not want to eat what is there. Stop first at the welcome center located just before you pay to enter. You will get a map which is helpful. Bring your camera and your patience. The trails are well marked to point out various things but you will get even more out of it if you take the time to look. There are no air boats here. You can rent a kayak or bring your own although you will be kayaking where there are alligators. But apparently it is not bad because many people kayak there. You may have to arrange for this in advance, not sure. If you get to Flamingo early enough, investigate the tickets for the various boat tours. I think it would have been worthwhile but the line was so long, we didn't have time. I would say that you should give yourself at least 5 or 6 hours there, probably more if you want to take a boat tour. Start out at lunch and go to Flamingo and wind your way back. Or, hit some of the stops on the way to Flamingo and some on the way back. Or, you may want to time your day so that you can see the sunset from either Flamingo or the high point stop. But, you will end up riding home in the dark if you do. Make sure to get a full tank of gas before you get here. We saw bald eagles and plenty of alligators. We also got a feel for the everglades. If you are over 62, time to get yourself a National Park pass.

Everglades National Park,"We visited shark valley visitor centre at the everglades national park on christmas day. We had wanted to go to the flamingo visotor centre for either the boat tour or canoe rental. I called two days before, from Miami, to the company that do the boat tours and canoe rental but nobody picked up the phones. All i got was a recorded message that stated that all canoe boat rental and boat tours must be booked 24 hours ahead or longer. There was nothing on the website that mention that reservation was a ""MUST"" otherwise we would have that sorted out while at home in Canada. After i heard the message about making reservation on the recorded message we still have 48 hours and we tried to make reservation online but the form asked for a US zip code which we didnt have since we are non US residents. Without the zipcode the online form just would not get through!!!! by then it was late and the business office in the hotel was closed so we could not use the fax either. It was a very frustrating time for us and we were very very disappointed as we had looked forward so much to this trip. I then called the national park itself and was told that they werent involved with the boat trip etc that I needed to call the company itself. I tried again many times, all i got was the same recorded messages. The flamingo centre was very far and we didnt want to go all the way and not been able to do the boat or canoe, so we decided to visit Shark valley instead. We were not able to get on the tram nor rent the bicycle with no reservation. Nevertheless the walk itself was very pleasant, we saw quite a few alligators, seven or eight types of birds and the weather was great for us to have a little picnic under the trees. So at the end we did enjoy ourselves but I think the company that do the boat tours etc should at least warn people that they must have reservations at least 24 hours ahead and it would be nice to speak to a real human being rather than a standard prerecorded voice messages. And why on earth the online form would not accept any non US residents ( with no zip code ) for reservation i will never know!

Everglades National Park,"The Mosquito Meter at the Visitor's Center rated this day in late November as average, so I dread to think what a bad day would be. Actually, the campground wasn't really as bad as the only nearby trail, the Coastal Prairie Trail, which was absolutely horrendous. We were only a few yards into it when we met a European couple who begged to borrow our mosquito spray. We soon turned back, and they followed shortly thereafter. We tried venturing out to the Eco Pond, but the pests proved too much for there, too. The area around the visitor's center was a mosquito-free zone, so we spent our time there. After dark, we rushed into our tent, and the next morning we made a quick escape. It was worth the visit to say we had stayed at the southernmost point of the Florida peninsula, but if you do it, be prepared!","December 8, 2014",Here's the buzz about camping at Flamingo,9,"Dunwoody, Georgia",3

Everglades National Park,"I hadn't realized that along the main road, there are many opportunities for short hikes - mostly a mile or less. Each provides a different ecological view of the park. You can view both alligators and crocodiles, as well as a variety of birds. Watch out for the turkey vultures at the Royal Palm trailhead; the birds peck out the rubber on car tops.

Everglades National Park,"I signed up for a tour with Garl's coastal kayaking and got Garl all to myself because it was just before the season.I will write a separate review of Garl's; my experience in Everglades National Park was largely colored by my exceptional guide.This is a very large park and we did quite a bit if driving to access the various destinations. My main focus was kayaking and I had an amazing time kayaking the Everglades, both in the fresh and salt water. I almost ran over an alligator with my kayak (by mistake)--Garl got a picture--I was astounded that alligator was so close.We also saw an alligator at the side of the road and stopped to take pictures beside him. Had I not had Garl with me, I would not have attempted any of this.We also did quite a bit of hiking.The scenery was amazing, even on a day that turned cold and overcast.","November 29, 2014",A wonderful national park,582,toronto,5
Everglades National Park,"This was a splendid day. There is an excellent visitor centre just outside the entrance near Homestead, At he Royal Palm Centre we strolled through the woods on the Gumbo Limbo trail and had an excellent guided walk and talk from a ranger on the Anhuinga trail, where we saw loads of wildlife including alligators and many varieties of birds. We drove the 37 miles down to Flamingo , but I would say don't bother. Stop along the way. Flamingo seems to be more of a pleasure boat dock than a wildlife park, with a very basic visitor centre, and although the parks map suggests you can eat at Flamingo, it's just a shop. Ideally take a picnic with you because there is nowhere to eat in the park. it is possible we were told, to see manitees in the marina at Flamingo But they weren't around when we were there.

Everglades National Park,"When my family went to the Everglades, we stopped at the Royal Palm Visitors' Center in the park. We pulled in and noticed that the cars were covered with tarps. Apparently, the vultures have developed a taste for rubber and will eat antennas, windshield wiper blades, and tires. Take advantage of the the tarps provided by the park service. Also, you are better off to park close to the other vehicles as there is more activity and will keep the vultures away. As for the visitor center, be sure to take some time to walk around the paths as the area is great for watching birds, fish, and alligators. The Everglades are a national treasure and it great to be able to visit a part of Florida that is not developed.

So many different kind of birds , a couple of alligators, turtles and beautiful nature.The trail next to it was a bit like a rain forest, and ok for a short walk.Then we chose to drive to Flamingo and upon arrival we were attacked by small, but vicious mosqitos. There was so many of them. Every time we stopped the car, there they were - and we had not had a single bite while walking the Anhinga Trail (but they are there in the early morning though!). We had planned to walk a couple of the other trails, but the mosquitos drove us back to the car.The 61 km drive through the park is somewhat boring, and my recommendation would be just to take the Anhinga Trail, which we took twice. Once around 1PM and again at 6:30 AM the following day.

Everglades National Park,"A definite ""Must See""!!! We went in from the Miami-Homestead direction. Stop at the visitor's center first to get a good overview of the park. Your next stop should be about a mile down the road on the left to the Ahinga Trail. This is the best place in the park to see alligators. We saw alligators, little blue herons, great white herons, turkey vultures and ahingas right up close - some as close as 12-15 feet away! Many photo opportunities! The path and boardwalk are easy to walk and are wheelchair accessible. This is a really great site. The next site we went to was at Flamingo. This is where they often see manatees (though we didn't -they were there earlier in the day). This place has a nice little visitor center with a mounted tarpon, Goliath grouper and a hammerhead shark - all caught out in the bay. They have a nice little marina there you can walk around.

The trails we visited were all paved or boarded so accessible to all, we spent two full days touring and exploring the trails and spent a never to be forgotten evening watching a beautiful sunset.

We drove from the main Visitor Center down to Flamingo. Disappointed that there isn't a cafe or restaurant open in Flamingo, but the sandwiches sold at the small store were not terrible.

I went in summer but the staff all said it is better in winter (easier to see animals). I did see American crocodiles (rarer than American alligators) on the boat tour from Flamingo visitor center, which was nice. I visited both entrances, the north one at Shark Valley and the south one that leads from Anhinga Trail down to the bay at Flamingo. Even the visitor centers are somewhat small and unimpressive compared to the national parks I have been to.

The entry fee to the park was $10, so quite reasonable. My kids are as much outdoor enthusiasts as the next kid, which is a negative as well as a positive, but they are true adventurers at heart and this stop was a memory of a lifetime for them.The walking tour of the habitat on the Annhinga trail was FANTASTIC. The volunteer was knowledgeable, humorous and who knew that a croc can growl?? Scary good! The wildlife viewing was wonderful.I opted to splurge and go all the way down to Florida Bay in the Glades and take the boat tour out into the Bay. For the 3 of us, lunch, drinks, snacks and boat tickets came to $104 plus change, which is definitely a reasonable fee.The Captain, who was a newer and relocated to Florida [and who's name now escapes me], and his mate [also now nameless but a young local chap], were GREAT guides. Funny, knowledgeable and no kidding, we actually got to see WILD Dolphins making mud circles to get their lunch in the Bay. Its an adaptive skill that only Dolphins in the Bay use for catching their prey and I was floored to be able to observe it.

Overall, however, as a visual experience, I find the park disappointing as miles of driving take you from one sea of grass to another, with little else to see. Only on the trails do you get a reasonable view of the variety of wildlife in residence there. If you drive all the way to the end of the road at Flamingo, you see Florida Bay and a Marina. There is a restaurant there with limited fare, and you can board a sightseeing boat for a tour of the Everglade's Mangroves. To experience the park without driving all the way through it, I would visit the trails at Royal Palm near the park entrance and then, if you plan to travel up towards Miami, visit the Shark Valley segment of the park located off U.S. route 41(Tamiami Trail). At the visitor center, you can board a tram, complete with guide, which takes you into the wilds for great animal viewing. At the extreme end of the ride, you can get out and walk up an observation tower which gives you a bird's eye view of the surroundings. You can also visit the restrooms. On the way back to the visitor center, the tram passes more alligators than you can count, with its wheels passing within inches of the (usually) snoozing reptiles. Your feet are so close to their snouts that it does give you pause. To reach this segment of the park, you pass through lands belonging to the Miccosukee Tribe of the Seminole Indians, and they offer a variety of airboat rides into the Everglades.

Just a very tired old Visitor's Center where the Ranger on duty seemed to disappear when people walked in... Also, there were millions of vicious mosquitos. We had bought a can of the natural repellent and made sure everyone was sprayed before we got out of the car. As soon as we were out, it was a black cloud. I kept the spray and continually sprayed the grand kids as we walked on the pavement to the visitor center.

Very few mosquitos and here was where the Alligators were sunning. We observed a half dozen on the nature trail loop. But again, no birds. Only saw two sunning on a rail, but none in flight or any on the water.I am thinking the time to go to the Everglades will be December when the winter birds are in.We were there on June 20, 2014.
