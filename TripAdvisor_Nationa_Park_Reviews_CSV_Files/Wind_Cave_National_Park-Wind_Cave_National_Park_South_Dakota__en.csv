Wind Cave National Park,"We didn't even realize this was on our route so we didn't take the cave tour. My husband was affraid that I couldn't do it with my bad knee, but I would have liked to! This was just another beautiful national park that we need to protect! I would definitely recommend traveling through it!","September 26, 2019",Beautiful Place to visit!,13,"Carthage, Missouri",4
Wind Cave National Park,We did not hae any trouble finding this National Park because I checked the website for directions. don't follow GPS. There are currently no cave tours because of elevator maintenance issues. It is still definitely worth the trip just for the drive and the visitors center is very good.,"September 25, 2019",Beautiful drive and nice visitor center but currently no cave tours,90,"Independence, Missouri",5
Wind Cave National Park,"The elevator was out and there were no cave tours being offered when we were there. They said it would be May 2020 before the elevator is fixed. But it is still a beautiful park that has a lot to offer. The visitors center has a museum describing how and when the cave was found. It also talks about the youngest cave guide who died in his early twenties. There is a walk to the scared area of the cave and it explains why the Indians believed the buffalo came from the cave. As for buffalo, be prepared to see a lot of them and to stay very far away from them.","September 21, 2019",No cave tour,91,oklahoma,5
Wind Cave National Park,"My husband and I went to Wild Cave National Park mid-week in late August. The elevator did not work so we could not take a tour of the cave. We went to the visitor center and listened to a lady ranger talk about the cave. We enjoyed the 15 minute talk and a small museum. There is a gift shop as well. The drive through the park was nice. We saw a couple bison. There was not much else to do. Yesterday, I read that the Jewel Cave elevators are not working. The Jewel Cave elevators worked about 4 weeks ago. I wonder what is going on with the elevators.","September 20, 2019",No cave tour because elevator is broken,631,"Austin, Texas",3
Wind Cave National Park,"We love going through caves so we were disappointed that the elevator is down and thus, no cave access. This was announced on the web page but we had made a last minute decision to stop here and so were unaware of this.There are some lovely prairie hikes and we saw bison and prairie dogs. The gentleman in the gift shop is both helpful and fun to chat with! I’d rate it higher than a 3 but is is a National Park partially based on a cave and you can’t visit the cave so it’s a 3 - sorry. ","September 18, 2019",Beautiful prairie no access to the cave,90,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",3
Wind Cave National Park,"Yes the cave itself is closed for elevator maintenance, but there is so much more to see and do! Driving in we were delighted to see all of the prairie dogs peeking out of their holes and scurrying across the road. We rolled down our windows so we could hear their chattering and stopped several times for pictures. We also saw a herd of buffalo. The visitor center has an excellent film about the cave and several interesting exhibits.You can walk to the entrance of the cave and we sat for quite awhile listening to the wind blowing out of the small entrance. There is also a one mile trail and a pavilion where on the hour a native speaker tells the story of this cave from the perspective of the Lakota People. So we will look forward to going into the cave at another time, but are very glad that we visited this special place.","September 16, 2019",Still Special and worth a stop!,64,"Canby, Minnesota",5
Wind Cave National Park,Not solo but with my sister. Cave is closed for elevator repair but still a lot available. Park office is open for your passport stamps and souvenirs. Thanks to employee who went out of his way to help me get a stamp at the last minute. ,"September 11, 2019",Road trip,17,"Springfield, Missouri",5
Wind Cave National Park,"Not much to say except disappointment is all we saw at Wind Cave, considering the most important thing to see is the cave it is not possible without the elevator. We started watching this event unfold in June as we prepared our cross country trip. I follow the National Park Service various parks especially the ones we plan to visit. The elevator failed in June, with promising news every week or so it was mended. We began our trip in August with not indicating issues with said elevator. Fast forward and 2000 miles later and low and behold the elevator is still broken and we stand before the ranger at the visitor center in abject disgust. It would have been nice to have seen a posting on FB or at least a hand written sign on the entrance telling us our visit was for naught. NPS needs to communicate this issue better, by the way don’t plan on the elevator being in service anytime in the near future, we certainly will not be back.","August 24, 2019",Disappointed,0,"Richmond, Virginia",1
Wind Cave National Park,"Unfortunately the elevators for the tours were down for repairs so a cave tour was not an option. Despite that my visit was worth the drive down from where I was staying in Custer. I heard two great ranger talks, one on the history of the cave and park, the other on exploring the cave and the cave features. ","August 22, 2019",Wind Cave NP,1,"Malvern, Pennsylvania",4
Wind Cave National Park,"The elevators are out of service until the end of September so that was very disappointing. However, it is well worth your trip. The video is a must see as well as the ranger talk outside one of the entrances to the cave. There is no admission fee. A must see if you are in the area.","August 21, 2019",Still amazing despite limited access.,25,"Peekskill, New York",4
Wind Cave National Park,I would of given this five stars but the elevators are broken. However there are plenty of rangers around giving talks. There were Buffalo right next to the road.,"August 12, 2019",Excellent park,12,"Rochester, New York",4
Wind Cave National Park,It's well documented that the elevator for the cave tours is out of commission but there is still plenty to see and enjoy above ground. Lots of wildlife and beautiful grassland to see while you drive and hike through the park. The visitor center was very informative on the history of the area and the rangers had plenty of recommendations to keep you busy above ground. My family of four completed the Rankin Ridge hike and loved the views. Prairie dogs are also plentiful and fun for the family to watch from numerous pull outs. Make sure you visit even if the cave tours are not possible!,"August 1, 2019",Still plenty to see above ground!,148,"Dublin, Ohio",5
Wind Cave National Park,"We went on 7/26/19 and the elevator was broken, so all cave tours were cancelled until possibly the end of August. Check the national parks website before you go to check the status of the tours. Although, having said that, the rangers still had presentations and you could go to the old entrance of the cave for a ranger talk. We took advantage of our extra time, to schedule a tour at Jewel Cave not too far away from Wind Cave. You can make reservations 72 hours in advance online or same day first come first serve at Jewel Cave. We made the best of it. Wind Cave next time. ","July 31, 2019",Wonderful park- be aware cave tours cancelled until further notice,180,"Las Vegas, Nevada",4
Wind Cave National Park,Went to wind cave on July 4 and found out there were no cave tours due to broken elevators. The rangers did a great job at the natural entrance explaining about the cave. Would have made reservations at jewel cave if I had known about this previously. ,"July 15, 2019",No cave tours,10,"Wayside, New Jersey",4
Wind Cave National Park,My wife and I went to Wind Cave National Park after visiting mount Rushmore and found it to be beautiful. The drive to there is almost as nice as the park itself. The cave was closed do to an elevator problem but we were still able to get a good informative talk about it from the ranger posted by the entrance. The visitor center had some excellent displays and information pieces to see as well.,"July 15, 2019",really cool,91,"Dade City, Florida",5
Wind Cave National Park,"Tickets for the tours are a first come, first serve basis, so we stopped by that morning to grab our tickets for an afternoon tour. We did the Natural Entrance cave tour. It lasted about 1 hour and 15 minutes or so. The beginning of the tour starts with them explaining why it is called Wind Cave. Pretty fascinating story! As you enter the cave you will go down lots and lots of steps. None too steep, but there are a bunch! The tour keeps a pretty good pace, allowing you to walk through a lot of the cave. Amazing box work is seen on this tour. Something we have not seen in other caves. You are not allowed to bring in any kind of bags, including purses, so make sure and do your research before arriving so this isn't an inconvenience for you. Bathrooms were well kept. Plenty of parking. A highly recommended stop!","July 11, 2019",Amazing Natural Entrance Tour,70,Nebraska,5
Wind Cave National Park,When I went there and it was my first time there and I enjoyed it. It was different and compared to all the other caves that I have been to with the box work. I was there on 6/26/17 and I had the first tour and what most people go on and it was suppose to start at 8:30 and it started at 8:45 and because the elevators and were not working and but I did the tour and like I wanted to do. After the tour was over the tour guide said the first ten can go up in the elevators and I wanted to be the first ten and to get back because I never know if it will completed brake down and so it ended 20 minutes after it's scheduled time and but at least I got up in the elevator and came back. So at least I enjoyed myself and it was very informational.,"July 10, 2019",The tour of the cave,54,"Park City, Illinois",4
Wind Cave National Park,"We were aware that the cave would be closed before we went so we weren't disappointed, but many people weren't aware until they arrived. The elevators are currently broken and they didn't know how long it will be before they're fixed. Many parks have deferred maintenance due to funding issues and this is the effect. There were rangers all over the visitors center explaining things so there was still lots of interaction. We walked down to the natural entrance and got to see exactly why it's called Wind Cave. The air blowing out was cold and strong. It felt great in the heat!The park itself above ground was beautiful. We saw bison, birds, rabbits, prairie dogs, and pronghorn.","July 9, 2019",Beautiful but no cave visits right now,19,"Belmont, North Carolina",4
Wind Cave National Park,"When we asked about how long, they said for long term. Like they didn’t know when they would open back up. Very sad. We got to see a buffalo, lots of prairie dogs and they had a lot of park rangers working to answer questions about the place. Pretty cool and I would have liked to see the caves. ","July 4, 2019",Caves were closed😕,37,Indiana,4
Wind Cave National Park,We didn't go to the cave but we did drive through this amazing place. My daughters absolutely loved it. The scenery was beautiful and we saw so many animals! It's definitely worth a visit. ,"July 2, 2019",So much wildlife! ,16,"Washington, Indiana",5
Wind Cave National Park,I didn't visit the cave. I just took a slow drive around to enjoy the fantastic scenery and the great wildlife. Hundreds of funny prairie dogs provide good entertainment right along the main road. Lots of buffalo everywhere but taking some of the side roads will give one a better view. A really peaceful place.,"June 29, 2019",An excellent small national park for wildlife.,163,"Everett, Washington",5
Wind Cave National Park,"The story Alvin that explored the cave with candle light was amazing. You can even take candle light tour, that's how Alvin explored the cave. We did the Fairground tour. 2 hours and we really was informative. The NPS guide was very well informed and made the tour fun. We stayed at the Elk Mountain Camp ground in the National Park $18 and was real close to mounds of prairie dogs, that was real neat.","June 29, 2019",Amazing Cave,11,"Buchanan, Michigan",5
Wind Cave National Park,"Tickets are first come first served. Either get there early, or plan on waiting for your tour. There are several tours. The Natural Entrance tour has as much talking time as walking time. Not too strenuous at all.","June 25, 2019",Great family activity in the area,17,"Temecula, California",5
Wind Cave National Park,"This was a great trip! Thanks to Lennie who led the tour! He did a wonderful tour and was very informative. This is a must see when visiting South Dakota! I love visiting caves in different areas/states. This cave is unlike others as it has very unusual formations that reminded me of the Italian cookies called pizzelle. It was around 52-53 degrees in the cave and when we were there it was a bit wet in areas. Just an FYI to anyone not familiar with the tour. Get there early as the passes for certain tours will run out! If you have an opportunity, read up on the different tours before you go so you know which one suits you and your group.","June 24, 2019",Excellent cave tour,13,,5

Wind Cave National Park,"I was a little apprehensive about this tour because one of the criteria for NOT going on this tour is claustrophobia. I have experienced some minor occurrences. However, I’m happy to say that on this tour, I was fine! There are a few places that are lower and that you have to squeeze through but most of it was not like that. You have to be in good physical condition to go on this tour. There is a lot of climbing, taking large steps, and most of this tour is off trail in complete darkness except for your LED candle. Being very careful where you step is critical. My husband and I loved the experience and our ranger, Missy, was super knowledgeable and personable! ","June 19, 2019",Candlelight Tour,59,"Frankfort, Illinois",5
Wind Cave National Park,"We have been to the Black Hills several times but have not been to this cave since I was a kid. We took our 2 boys (11 & 8) and it was a highlight of our trip! We did the Fairground Tour and while there are a lot of stairs, we did not find it strenuous at all. The temp is 54 degrees so dress accordingly. This cave is not all sparkly, but it is so cool to see an actual cave and the formations within. And our tour guide was phenomenal with lots of education and fun. This is very reasonably priced, especially for the area. And it’s a National Park!! Check it out! ","June 19, 2019",Great staff & Neat Cave,3,"Aberdeen, South Dakota",4
Wind Cave National Park,"We took the Wild Cave —four hours long, described as “strenuous.” It was great! Grant, our ranger guide was super friendly and fun. We found that it was more “technical” than “strenuous.” Great park, amazing cave!","June 15, 2019",Wild Cave tour is amazing!,69,"Glendale, Arizona",5
Wind Cave National Park,We had such a great time on the candle light tour with our tour guide Taylor! Was one of the coolest things we’ve ever done. You do need to wear pants and long sleeves because it’s kinda cold down there but also because oils from your skin can hurt the rock down there. Also you need to wear tennis shoes. It does have some rough terrain and hard walking but you don’t have to be very athletic to do it. The story is great and we had such a fun time! Wish we could have taken pictures but that’s okay. ,"June 14, 2019",Loved the candle light tour! ,23,"Greensboro, North Carolina",5
Wind Cave National Park,"The national park is more than just the cave. The surrounding area has lots of bison and prong horn antelope. Very pretty drive. There is no charge for the park but there is a charge for the cave tours. We did the natural entrance tour. All tours are led by a ranger. Some of them require advance reservation. The tour stops at the natural entrance which was interesting. The ranger had a ribbon to demonstrate the wind coming out of the cave which is how it was discovered. There are not impressive formations in this cave. There is some ""box works"". It is still cool to walk along through some narrow passage ways with low ceiling. Mind your head. The tour takes a little over an hour. Wear a light jacket and good shoes. The steps (over 300) were slippery in spots. You do get an elevator ride up and out. There were 2 elevators which the ranger said were built in 1938 and updated in the 90s. Only 10 people can go at a time and they weren't using one of the elevators because it had been getting stuck. Hmm. Makes one nervous about getting in the other one. Our ranger, Karen, was fine but we had a big group and sometimes it was hard to hear her if we were lined up single file. Of course she did the turn off the lights deal. She also lit a candle to show what the first explorer was dealing with. Tour is not for anyone with bad knees. Enjoyable but not the best cave ever. Visitor center was very busy. Had a picnic lunch at a close by picnic spot in the park.","June 14, 2019",Ranger led tours,273,"Atlanta, Georgia",4
Wind Cave National Park,"After seeing some of the pictures, I opted out of touring the cave due to physical limitations (going down stairs and winding stairway). My husband took the tour while I spent time in the exhibit area. There's about 150 miles of unexplored cave. The Ranger shared that we were fortunate to visit at the beginning of the season since thousands come June - Sept. After the tour, we drove thru the National Park was beyond words to explain the beautiful scenery and wildlife.We had a 4-wheel drive car which allowed us to go off road. We saw a pheonimal number of bison, including babies. We even had to stop for almost 30 minutes while the bisons were on the grazing each side of the road and blocking the road.","June 12, 2019",Best Adventure,33,"San Marcos, California",5
Wind Cave National Park,"Participated in 9 AM Natural Entrance Tour. Ranger/ Guide was most informative. Comfortable wearing shorts with light coat. Some tight and low spaces, but not a bad walk. While cave system is large it is not as impressive as other cave systems [Carlsbad, for instance]. Good above ground information center manned by knowledgeable Rangers. Information facility overrun by large group of bicyclists later, upon completion of cave tour [restrooms, water bottle fills, blocking entrance to facility, etc.]. And, while few tourists were at facility early, significantly more arrived later in the morning [it got crowded]. ","June 9, 2019",Natural Entrance Tour,25,"Fruit Cove, Florida",3
Wind Cave National Park,Do the Natural Entrance Tour! There are 150 miles of underground cave trails in one square mile. The tour takes about an hour and a half and is very cool. Our ranger was very animated and informative. The tour is free but you need to get there early . There is a tour about every hour.,"June 4, 2019",Off the beaten track but worth the trouble,95,"Hickory, North Carolina",4
Wind Cave National Park,"We had the opportunity to drive through the southern part of the park on our way to Hot Springs. Loved seeing all the wildlife; got to see (and hear) plenty of prairie dogs with their little babies. Lots of bison, several very near or crossing the road, so be careful when driving. We saw a few deer and a lone pronghorn. With beautiful scenery and the wildlife, definitely worth a drive through and even stop at one of the pull offs and bit and take it all in. Be sure to keep the buffalo at least a “thumb away” - hold your thumb up to the bison and if your thumb covers it, you’re a safe distance away. ","June 3, 2019",Beautiful Drive,329,"Gettysburg, Pennsylvania",5
Wind Cave National Park,"We drove through the Park, the prong horns and buffallo were plentiful to see along the road. We did not go into the cave, whcih I believe I read it is one of the longest caves in usa. ","May 29, 2019",Memorial Day Weekend,41,"Golden, Colorado",4
Wind Cave National Park,"As other reviews mentioned once in the park the drive to the visitor center was fantastic. Rolling hills, curving roads, abundant wildlife. Really a park where you park the car in a turnoff get the lawnchairs out of the trunk and just sit. From.the visitor center there are a couple drives and several hikes. The center itself was not large but highly informative displays and reading material.","May 27, 2019",Gorgeous & Unique,176,"laconia, nh",5
Wind Cave National Park,"Driving through the park to get to the cave is half the fun... as there are some spectacular vistas... and loads of wildlife like... a ton of prairie dogs, lots of mule deer, two big groups of wild turkeys and a few buffs in the distance.The other half of the fun is the cave itself. We arrived after lunch on a cool and rainy Friday... and got tickets for the 2:00 Natural Entrance tour. The guide makes all the difference in tours like this... and we had an excellent one... knowledgeable with plenty of personal insights into the cave's and park's history... plus a great sense of humor. The signature formation of the cave is its Box Work. The cave doesn't have any stalactites or stalagmites because of the way the ground water is absorbed by the limestone. Its popcorn formations are equally interestingThere are some steep stairs going down, but you get to ride an elevator back up. There are also some low bridges to duck through. Unless you're a hard core chlosterphobe, you should be OK. Kind of interesting in that it was warmer in the cave than it was outside.The tour takes about an hour. I'd suggest having a time reservation during the season.","May 25, 2019",All the Fun,377,"Chestertown, Maryland",5
Wind Cave National Park,"We took the ranger-led ""Natural Entrance"" tour and thoroughly enjoyed it. Our ranger was straight out of central casting -- blonde haired, blue eyed, an adept teller of amusing, informative stories. It was cold and drizzly the day we visited, so the cave was actually a pleasant escape from the wet weather. Be aware that the tours leave at designated times and are limited in number, so if you're on a tight schedule you might want to call ahead and reserve a spot on a tour.","May 24, 2019",Fascinating,51,"Memphis, Tennessee",5
Wind Cave National Park,"My wife and I took the natural cave tour this afternoon. The description says it is moderately strenuous, but we found it easy as it is generally downhill with approximately 300 steps to reach the bottom of our tour route. Our guide was a ranger from Minnesota and very knowledgeable about the history and geology of the cave. The tour is over semi rough and slick concrete passages with numerous head bangers all around. Of course, my tiny wife never needed to duck, but the rest of us did! We were both expecting a long climb up, but to our surprise we rode an elevator at the end of the tour to the surface! Definitely a must see caving experience in a South Dakota.","May 23, 2019",Fantastic tour with an amazing guide ,102,"Benson, Arizona",5
Wind Cave National Park,"The drive through the park was filled with roaming wildlife. The exhibit in the Visitor's Center was interesting. The tour guide was engaging and the cave's boxwork was unique; I couldn't stop looking at it! We were only able to do the Natural Entrance Tour as the other tours don't run this time of year. I wish we could have done the Fairgrounds Cave Tour since it features more frostwork and popcorn; however, I'm glad we added Wind Cave to our destination list. It was a worthwhile stop.","May 21, 2019",Mesmerized by Boxwork,18,"Indianapolis, Indiana",4
Wind Cave National Park,"Be sure to be there early to get a tour. Tours are, of course, required to see the cave, the fifth longest in the world. We got there at 8, and there were a lot of people already waiting. We got the Fairgrounds Tour at 9:40 (1.5 hours, 2/3 mile, $18). I was able to get my brother's family a tour as well for later in the day so they could get there later. It's absolutely worth it, so magical and foreign to witness those caves. After buying our tickets we got my 'tweens signed up for the Junior Ranger program, got a bird checklist, and watched the 20-minute movie. The tour started in a small building with lots of barn swallows nearby, and we waited for the group to go down the elevators to the cave entrance. The tour was amazing, so intriguing. There are 30 miles of trails that traverse the park's Black Hills mixed-grass prairie landscape. After the tour we went on a lovely hike, Cold Brook Trail, 1.4 miles one-way. It was a really nice hike and we were so amused by those prairie dogs, frantically warning others about our presence. The trail winds through Cold Book Canyon until the end of the park boundary, which is very clearly marked.","May 18, 2019",Be there early,161,"Westminster, Colorado",5
Wind Cave National Park,"Wind Cave came as a secondary thought to the Badlands and Mount Rushmore on our trip through South Dakota but it shouldn't be. Without doing a cave tour, we still loved this site. We started out driving through the park and seeing tons of bison. There are tons of stories about how they stop traffic sometimes and its easy to see why. This is a great place to see wildlife, especially bison. We continued to the visitor center and explored there a little bit, stamped our passports and then headed out to hike the Rankin Ridge trail. This isn't their most strenuous, but it was one of the most fun. Be cautioned you have to drive to the start of the trail, pass a prairie dog colony which is adorable, and then you can begin. Its all uphill on dirt and soil but its very well marked. The view from the top is incredible as well, overlooking 4 different states. There is a firetower that is now off limits at the top. Be cautious while hiking, because on the trail itself its rare you'll encounter anything but on the way back down the loop there can be bison. The rangers at the front desk keep a watchful eye and will update you based on what trail you plan on hiking. Bring food and water along with you, as this area is very remote and there aren't really places to stop and eat for at least 25 minutes by car back toward Keystone in the town of Custer.","May 16, 2019","Without a cave tour, still 5 stars",106,"Long Island, New York",5
Wind Cave National Park,"The cave tour was fun, the ranger kept it interesting and never seen anything like the box formations.

Wind Cave National Park,"Our original RV trip was going from Denver to Mt. Rushmore and then I found a National Park I had never heard of on the way, Wind Cave NP. What an unexpected Gem!

Guides are wonderful and it's really not that cold.","May 14, 2019",Unexpected Gem!,130,"Calabasas, California",5
Wind Cave National Park,"We visited Wind Cave a couple of years ago and found it an amazing experience. This year we had our adult daughters with us, one of whom had a bad experience in a small cave i Wisconsin as a child. This time she wanted to overcome this fear with us. The cave journey was fun and enlightening. The cave itself and Ranger Justin were a delightful duo. We' sure all the rangers who lead tours have their virtues, but it's difficult to imagine Ranger Justin's being surpassed. Bottom line, our daughter is talking about her next cave experience.","May 14, 2019",Ain't Afraid of Caves No More,11,"Brookings, South Dakota",5
Wind Cave National Park,"We thoroughly enjoyed all of the wildlife around the National Park while driving to the caves. Then, we had the most enjoyable tour with a Ranger Justin. He was quite knowledgeable and very interesting. The cave has some interesting features that aren’t found in many other caves. This was a very interesting cave. About 300 steps down and an hour plus of walking inside. Certainly worth the $12 fee. ","May 10, 2019",Fascinating tours,519,"Greencastle, Indiana",5
Wind Cave National Park,"This place was not high on my list of things to do in the Black Hills area, but I think it ended up being my favorite!

Wind Cave National Park,"We took a cave tour and while 2 of our five (only one being a kid) were not great in caves but not claustrophobic, we had a great time. You can bring a flashlight, headlamp or use your phone but please don't shine it up, people who have had their eyes adjust to the dark will be temporarily blind if you do. The tour was great and the guide was funny and informative. You can also drive around the park or hike which we did not do. There's also a little museum and people of all ages can earn a Junior Ranger badge! Also, make sure none of your clothing and especially shoes have been in a cave with white nose. You don't want to bring that to the bats here.","April 26, 2019",Awesome adventure through a cave and lots of sites to see!,20,,5

Wind Cave National Park,"My husband was really looking forward to the Natural Entrance Tour of the Cave system below Wind Cave National Park and we arrived at around 10 am for the 11:30 tour listed on the government website. Unfortunately they were not running that tour as listed and substituted the Garden of Eden tour which sees less, is shorter and easier. It was not what we wanted. I still wanted to see the Cave and purchased a ticket ($10). My husband opted to take a nap in the car. The ranger leading the tour was quite personable, funny and informative. The tour enters and leaves the cave system by elevator making it more comfortable for elderly people and small children ( there were many children). There is a bit of walking and some stairs. The formations are interesting and I’m glad I saw it but would have much preferred the other tour. In this age of digital information, it should not be that difficult to keep things truly updated. We could have structured our day to arrive in the afternoon for the tour we truly wanted.I also took a walking trail behind the visitor center which had some great views. That particular trail was quite steep. Also arriving at and leaving the visitor center we were delighted to see several buffalo and countless prairie dogs.Wind Cave National Park is certainly worth a visit, I just hope you get the tour you want.","April 18, 2019",Wonderful Cave Tour but Please Keep Website Updated,138,"Las Vegas, Nevada",4

Wind Cave National Park,"We planned to visit this park as part of a four-day itinerary in the Black Hills. We were interested in taking a cave tour, but were traveling with a wheelchair so our tour options were limited. Because the tour tickets are sold first-come, first served on the day of the tour, they frequently fill up and/or require a long wait for a later tour. This made it very difficult to plan a cave tour into our trip. Unfortunately, we simply didn't have enough time to gamble on the chance that we MIGHT be able to take a tour on the day and time we had available. We couldn't afford to wait several hours, therefore we visited the park and enjoyed the visitor center exhibits and abundant wildlife, but passed on taking the tour. It would probably be fine for those staying in the nearby campground, but the policy is problematic for those of us who are traveling any distance.The park is open year-round and there is no fee to enter or use the visitor center, picnic area, and hiking trails. The visitor center opens daily at 8:00am and closes between 4:30 and 7:00pm, based on season. Wildlife such as bison, pronghorns, prairie dogs, and deer are frequently seen along SD87 in the northwest corner of the park. The cave tours are the main attraction at this park and they leave from the visitor center. Several different tours are offered of various lengths and difficulty. The tour schedule is limited in the cooler months between Labor Day and Memorial Day; for the best selection visit during the summer. (The tour schedule is posted on the park website.) Fees are required for the cave tours and they vary depending on the tour, the age of the participant, and whether a NPS pass is used ($5-12). ""Garden of Eden"" is the easiest; a 1-hour, .3-mile tour with 150 stairs. The most popular tour is ""Natural Entrance"", a 75-minute, .6-mile walk with 300 stairs. ""Fairgrounds"" is the most strenuous walking tour at 90 minutes with 450 stairs in .6 mile. Space is limited and reservations are not taken for these three tours above. Tickets are first-come, first-served, so it's strongly recommended to arrive at the visitor center when it opens. Two additional special tours are offered during the summer: ""Candlelight"" (hard, 2 hours through unlighted area of the cave, must be 8 years old, $6-12) and ""Wild Cave"" (very hard, 4 hours long, crawling required, must be 16 years old, $15-30). Reservations are taken for these two special tours only beginning one month in advance at (605) 745-4600. None of the tours listed above are wheelchair accessible, however a limited area of the cave can be reached by wheelchair. Inquire at the visitor center or contact the park at the aforementioned number to request an accessible tour. Elk Mountain Campground is located near the cave and visitor center (fee). There is no food service in the park, but the visitor center gift shop may have snack items like trail bars.","March 7, 2019",Reservations Should Be Accepted for All Tours,1781,"Tucson, Arizona",3
Wind Cave National Park,"We were glad we read reviews ahead of time as we knew we had to arrive early to get on a tour. We camped there the night before and lined up outside about 1/2 hr before the center opened. There were several people ahead of us, I believe we got on the 2nd main tour of the day. Some tours were already selling out. Tour was worth the effort and money. Very interesting cave and story behind it's discovery. Rated as a 4 just because of the rushed feeling common with tours. Still worth it for older kids and adults, young kids probably would not appreciate the beauty and history and may get antsy (note, no touching calve walls, etc).

Wind Cave National Park,"We did not expect much from this trip. My daughter and I were taking a slow ride home until the rest of our party could catch up with this. I saw this in the brochures and we decided to check it out. This ended up being a highlight of the trip. The story goes that the caves were found when a passerby heard a sound like air blowing and went to investigate. It blew off his hat. When he went back to town, a young man heard the story and then went back and not only investigated but also mapped a lot of the caves by himself by making drawings. This is a dry cave and very different from the caves we have have been to in the past which have stalagmites and stalactites. These have honeycomb formations and is a must see if you are healthy enough for the descent. .","February 13, 2019",Quite the Gem,4,"Custer, South Dakota",5
Wind Cave National Park,"Wind Cave, one of the oldest National Parks, was established 1903 to protect the cave that derives its name from the wind blowing in and out of the small natural entrance as the air pressure of the cave is constantly adjusting to match that of the atmosphere as weather fronts pass through the area. The cave itself is one of the longest in the world with 149 known miles (240k), one of the most complex, and contains about 95% of the world’s known cave formation called boxwork. While most would not consider boxwork as beautiful as other cave formations, it is unique, intricate, delicate in appearance and certainly worth seeing at least once.Located at the southern end of the Black Hills foothills, perhaps what most people do not realize is that above ground is just as special as the park protects some beautiful rolling prairie that is full of wildlife that is easily viewed along the park’s roads and a number of good short to intermediate trails.To see the park in half a day or so, we would recommend getting an early start as cave tour tickets are sold in person at the visitor center only, on a first come, first serve basis, and go fast during the busy summer season, especially if rain is in the forecast. If arriving late, one is still likely to be able to purchase a cave tour ticket but it may be for late in the day and/or not your first choice of tours. If you can handle the 450 stairs along the route, we would highly recommend the 1.5 hour long Fairgrounds cave tour as one gets to see all the highlights of the cave in one tour.While waiting for your tour to depart, or after your tour, explore the excellent exhibits in the visitor center and when done here, drive to the trailhead for the Rankin Ridge Nature Trail, a 1 mile long (1.6k) loop trail, which is the best short hike in the park, providing some stunning views, including the Badlands to the east on a clear day. Along the roads, on the way to the trailhead, one is likely to see bison, elk, prairie dogs and perhaps pronghorn, coyotes and more so take your time. When one is done with the Rankin Ridge hike, continue north on main road in this part of the park, Hwy 87, where one will see more wildlife, to enter the even more spectacular Custer State Park just to the north.","February 3, 2019",Explore Below and Above Ground,3757,"Avon, Ohio",4

Wind Cave National Park,"Lots of history here. Like us, you probably never heard of Wind Cave or Wind Cave National Park. We didn't, until we began to explore all of the tourist attractions in South Dakota. We had visited this area before, several years ago, but the extent of our interest led us to Badlands National Park and Mount Rushmore. On this trip, we vowed not to miss a thing. Wind Cave National Park, located 10 miles north of Hot Springs, was established as the seventh U.S. National Park in 1908 by President Theodore Roosevelt. It was the first cave to be designated as a national park anywhere in the world. It is the sixth longest cave in the world with 140.47 miles of explored passageways. Above ground, the park includes the largest remaining natural mixed grass prairie in the United States. So why don't more people know about it? Discovered in 1881, the cave is notable for its displays of the calcite formation known as boxwork. Approximately 95 percent of the world's discovered boxwork formations are found in Wind Cave. It also is known for its frostwork and is recognized as the densest cave system in the world. Because no valuable mineral deposits were found in the cave, it was developed for tourism. Several roads run through the park and there are 30 miles of hiking trails. The Wind Cave Visitor Center features three exhibit rooms that focus on the geology of the caves and early cave history, the park's wildlife and natural history and the work of the Civilian Conservation Corps in the park in the 1930s. There are 75 sites for tents and recreational vehicles at Elk Mountain Campground, which is located near the visitor center.","September 26, 2018",The first cave ever to be named a national park,4679,"Chicago, Illinois",5

Wind Cave National Park,"Wind Cave is not what most people imagine: this is a mostly dry cave, and doesn't own flowstone, stalactites, and stalagmites. Instead, it offers pale brown brittle minerals built up on its walls and ceilings called boxwork, and white minerals looking like popcorn that share that name. The cave system itself is huge, one of the largest in the United States.Tours are limited to 40 people each, and are led by well-informed park rangers. The path is well lighted, but the footing can be a bit slippery, so wear good walking shoes without slick soles. There is a handrail through most of the tour to grab if you slip or lose your balance. Jackets are also recommended.This is the second time I've toured this cave; it was the first time for my partner. The silence is tremendous inside, all you can hear is the person next to you breathing or the sounds of footfalls when the ranger-guide pauses in his or her spiel. And of course, when the ranger-guide turns off the lights, it is absolutely dark. There are a few drips along the path because the summer has been quite wet, and water is percolating into the cave through cracks in the stone above. Intriguing what Nature does with minerals.

Wind Cave National Park,"My fella and I went to Wind Cave and split up to do two separate cave tours. (It's a long story...you can find it under my Mammoth Cave review from a couple of years back if you really want the details.) Anyway, I went on the easier Garden of Eden Tour and he took the Fairgrounds Tour. His tour was longer, starting 10 minutes before mine and ending 10 minutes later. Only my tour didn't start on time. They had been having elevator problems, and our tour guide had taken 1/2 our group down in the elevator, and then got stuck on the way back up to get the rest of us! We waited, and waited....and basically figured out on our own what was going on. Finally another tour guide showed up, and he took us down to meet up with the other half of our group. We were not feeling any too chipper about using that other elevator car, but we made it. After a few more minutes someone showed up with the new guides gear and such so he could take us through. The other gal was STILL stuck in there. I asked the person who ran his gear down to please try to find my friend when his tour ended so he wouldn't be looking for me and get upset that I wasn't where we had arranged to meet. Or...honestly...so he wouldn't think I was having another issue like the one at Mammoth Cave! Anyway, our tour ran a half hour late and no one did find him to explain, but it was OK. He hadn't hit the panic button and thought we had just kept missing each other. We still give it a 4 because the boxwork is unique and only available in that one place, and they do a great job at getting so many visitors through on tours each day.

Sure the wind cave has structures created by wind so I included a photo so you could see, but I was not impressed. Jewel Cave is not too far away and a better option. We had to stand in a queue for over half n hour, then wait for our time slot which was another hour and a half and then do the cave tour. The museum of information is quite interesting and worth wandering around. For the cave tour you meet at a spot and then go down a lift which is too small for your group so you stand around waiting for everyone to go down and then when you get to the bottom you wait for the rest of the group to join you. The lift is very slow and you seem to stand around forever. Then they take you on the walking tour and you see a couple of structures and then walk back along much of the same route. Once back at the lift the same procedure happens except now you have to queue in the dark tunnel behind the group in front of you who are still trying to get out and are waiting for the lift.

Wind Cave National Park has peaks, grasslands, one of the United States longest explored cave system!.Well maintained, the Ranger station is staffed with nice folks eager to share, well worth pre planning a visit.

Wind Cave National Park,"We took the Natural Entrance cave tour, which was lead by Alexandra. She has a passion for her work that really helped to make the tour interesting. Every elementary age kid in our group was riveted. This cave has “boxwork,” which I had never seen before. The cave is very large and has many unexplored passages. The stairs can be steep and narrow, but they are mostly down. The trip back up is by elevator. The drive through the park is good for spotting wildlife, including bison and prairie dogs.","August 18, 2018","Excellent park ranger, unique cave",39,"Tulsa, Oklahoma",5

Wind Cave National Park,"We did a tour but had to purchase tickets the day before. The Ranger was great and had been part of a team that discovered two new rooms in the cave. Lots of steps like 700 not all going down. Don't let that scare you we are couple of Sr. who if you look at us our bodies do not scream physically fit but the effort is not extreme the pace is not fast and lots of breaks and the wonders of the cave are worth the time and efforts. We camped, nice sites. We saw lots of wildlife Bison, antelope prairie dogs and mule deer.

Wind Cave National Park,Okay so some people may have written a review about us bringing our one year old down here. SORRY!! She is the best traveler ever and suddenly started teething hard core when we got in the cave. And she got super scared when they turned the lights off.But it was amazing. Our guide was amazing . She was a super great story teller and was so intentional with our daughter trying to get her to laugh. Also our crew of people we went with really looked out for me as I was wearing her and would tell me if there was uneven ground. And would entertain her when we were ideal. Natural entrance tour is amazing we will be back when our kids can walk this on their own.,"August 11, 2018",Yesssss,39,"Detroit Lakes, Minnesota",5
Wind Cave National Park,"We did the Natural Entrance Tour with Ranger Lauren on 8/9/18. She was such a great tour guide and speaker. She was so knowledgeable and really connected with everyone in our group. Her speech at the end was very touching and inspiring. The cave itself was very cool. At one point we were 20 stories underground. The history of the area and the cave were also interesting. I’m so thankful these places are protected and are still be explored. The visitor center was very informative as well. The drive leading the the visitor center gave us a glimpse at some wildlife. Prairie dogs, antelope and even a coyote.

Wind Cave National Park,"If you have been to some of the really large & astounding caves scattered throughout the world, you may be a bit disappointed with this one. It is fairly bland and devoid of typical formations one can find in other caves-the wet ones, not dry like Wind Cave.

Wind Cave National Park,"We went to Jewel Cave first thing in the morning because their tours are popular and sell out by 11:00 am on some days. We did a tour at Jewel Cave and were finished by noon, so we decided to drive over to Wind Cave and see if we could get a tour there... which is not as popular.We got there in the early afternoon and the still had tours for the day. We only had to wait about an hour. The tour was not as nice as Jewel Cave and the tour leader was nothing near as knowledgeable, but it had done very interesting limestone formations and would have been a great backup plan if we didn’t get into Jewel Cave. As it was, the character of this Cave is much different... much longer, tighter, and with its own unique honeycomb formations. Got to see some wildlife... bison, prairie dogs, and birds in the land above the caves. It was an enjoyable way to spend a few hours in a different type of area.","August 5, 2018",A good back-up plan,52,"San Jose, California",4
Wind Cave National Park,"Most of our group is not able to hike the cave so we did an auto tour. We enjoy wildlife more than a cave anyway. The park ranger at the Visitor's Center told us to make a loop by using 385 to 87 to 5 (unpaved) to 101 to 385.We probably took 2 hours to complete this loop due to the abundant wildlife. Saw about a dozen buffalo, hundreds of prairie dogs, a coyote with a prairie dog in its mouth, two pronghorns, a burrowing owl, western meadowlarks, and bluebirds.","August 2, 2018",Lots to see on the surface,7,"Franklin, TN",5

Wind Cave National Park,This is a somewhat tricky cave to rate for it is very different from most caves. As a dry cave it lacks the kinds of features and big rooms one tends to expect so it suffers in those respects. But it's uniquity earns points also. The tours are about an hour to an hour twenty minutes. There isn't a lot to see and we were lucky enough to be near the lead through much of the tour. The give was in front and showed us things those further back could not see. So an awkward tour. You should bring a flashlight to examine things noypte lit July the installed lighting. ,"July 28, 2018",Very unusual cave,162,"Austin, Texas",4
Wind Cave National Park,The tour guide was very nice and informative. The cave it self I thought was boring. Really not much to see. It's a dry cave and hardly no formations. You just basically go thru this narrow dark passage for an hour and that's it. ,"July 27, 2018",It's a cave,18,"Las Vegas, Nevada",4
Wind Cave National Park,The 1 1/2 hour of the cave is certainly worth the time and visit. Arrive early as the cave is a very popular stop. The National Park Ranger provided an excellent tour thru narrow passageways so where good shoes. It’s history was well explained. There is an entrance fee of $12 per adult unless you have a National Park pass then it is reduced to $6. The temp in the cave is 55 degrees so be prepared. ,"July 26, 2018",Excellent National Park,30,"Auburn Hills, MI",5
Wind Cave National Park,"Arrive early if you want to do a tour in the area. Both Wind Cave and Jewel Cave tours filled up early. We got there pretty early but still had to wait a couple hours for tour. Tour guide knowledgeable and told some interesting stories about wind cave. I thought Jewel cave was nicer, but the box work is pretty unique. Only 1 tour was available on the day we went and heard the others were better. The tour we were on was ok but it was mainly walking with only 3-4 larger rooms was the group to meet for pics. We liked it but have liked other tours more.","July 24, 2018",Good cave tour,10,"Clarkston, Michigan",4
Wind Cave National Park,"Our family did the Natural Cave Entrance tour and it was just right in terms of time. The cave has some interesting ""boxwork"" formations and some cave popcorn, but no great vaults or rooms. You snake your way along a very clear cement path the entire way. Ranger Joe had some great historical and geological information that kept us interested. If I had been walking alone, I would have probably sped through in about 30 mins. I wasn't as awestruck as I had hoped. In any event, the cave is cool which was great on a 100 degree day, but it wasn't cold. The path and stairs are concrete and are not constrictive. You don't have to squeeze through or slide anywhere. You can walk normally with a little ducking here and there. The tours are popular and there are only a limited number of spots per tour. We arrived around 1:30pm and were lucky to get a spot on the next tour. We had to wait in line for 15 mins to buy tickets. There were some available, but others behind me had to wait for a whole other round. It would be a good idea to buy tickets in advance.","July 24, 2018",Interesting cave tour,115,"Barre, Vermont",4
Wind Cave National Park,"We took 9 scouts (and 4 adults) to Wind Cave. We did the Natural Entrance Tour. The cave had a lot of neat formations to view. Our guide was a little dry in her delivery, but I think she may have been new, so I am sure it will get better as she becomes more comfortable. The price was reasonable and there are several tour options to choose from. The gift shop and some nice items as well. You have to reserve tickets in person. No matter what time you want to go, I would recommend stopping by the visitor's center and buying your tickets firs thing in the morning when they open. We wanted an afternoon tour, so we stopped by a few minutes after 8am and there was already quite a line to buy tickets. We were able to get the tour we wanted, but it did sell out at some point during the day.

Wind Cave National Park,"Our family had an excellent time at Wind Cave, enjoying the cave tour and the beautiful scenery of the park. As soon as we entered the park boundary, we saw several lone bison scattered amongst the rolling hills. We also drove through a prairie dog down and saw lots of the little critters running around. We stopped at the Visitor Center first to purchase our tickets (can only be purchased on-site). We did the Fairgrounds Tour and it was fantastic. Our tour guide was very friendly, enthusiastic, and knowledge about the cave. This cave is most know for it's Boxwork formations. It's a different type of cave, but still very neat to see. After our tour we stopped at the picnic area just north of the visitor center. We were disappointed as this was a very small picnic area. Only a few picnic tables. We continued our drive up 87 and saw a few more bison, prairie dogs, and antelope. We stopped and hiked the Rankin Ridge trail. This is an average hike, only a mile long, and offers breath-taking views of the surrounding area. Then, per the rangers suggestion we turned onto road number 5 (dirt road) and saw several large herds of bison, more prairie dogs, birds and even a coyote! A great way to spend a day!","July 22, 2018",Another Great National Park,82,"Palm Harbor, Florida",5
Wind Cave National Park,We arrived first thing in the morning and were able to get tickets for the second tour. This gave us time to walk the little trail around the visitors center. The cave isn't as cold as I thought it would be. Definitely want good walking shoes as the floors can be damp. Some areas are narrow and give you a sense of what those early explorers would have been going through. Highly recommend.

Wind Cave National Park,"We had a great tour of Wind cave — our tour guide was very knowledgeable and engaging. The one problem — tours sell out quickly. We first arrived in the early afternoon and were told that there were no more tours for the day. You cannot enter the cave without being part of a tour. So we had to return early in the morning the following day to get in to see the cave. If your travels only allow you a late morning or afternoon arrival, don’t count on getting in to see the cave.

Wind Cave National Park,Wind Cave was fantastic. Yes we did a guided cave tour - garden tour - which was a lot of downwards steps - not strenuous though and the temperature outside was in the 90s so it was fantastic down in the cave around 60 degrees. The cave formations were fascinating as was the stories the ranger told of the cave's discovery and exploration. The park staff was extremely helpful. Bathrooms are available at the visitor center. You must sign up for tours ahead of time so make sure you check the visitor center for times and get your tickets when you can. We also hiked the surface trails (Fire tower trail) which was an outstanding moderate trail to he top of the ridge. Beautiful views. We also saw the buffalo herd (my first time seeing a free range buffalo in the wild). Prairie dogs were also abundant. Awesome place to see if you are in the badlands area. There was no fee to get into the park itself only to take the tours - and of course to adopt a buffalo in the gift shop.,"July 18, 2018",Overlooked Gem,32,"Farmingdale, New York",5
Wind Cave National Park,My husband is not into caves but we were camping nearby and thought we'd checkout the park. A nice ranger at the door recommended the Fire Tower Trail hike since we enjoy hiking. We were both impressed with the ease of climbing to the highest point in the park and the many birds we encountered on our way to the top. If we went again we would go up and down on the trail instead of the road down just for the birds. The mile hike was one of our highlights to the Black Hills. The visitor center is very nice. We did not take a cave tour.,"July 17, 2018",Fire Tower Trail,39,"Uvalde, Texas",5
Wind Cave National Park,"I recently visited Wind Cave National Park on a Wednesday when vacationing in South Dakota. It was my 3rd time visiting South Dakota, but I had never stopped to see the caves in this area yet. I had read that the cave tours get pretty booked up, but when I called the day before, I was told that they do not take reservations, and that tours are booked on a first-come first-serve basis. I made my way directly to Wind Cave from Keystone after I checked out of my hotel to see about getting on a cave tour. I was arriving here by about 11:45 or so, and I could see right away that it was very busy. I almost couldn't even find a parking spot. I went right in to the visitor center, and it was nearly a 2-hour wait to get on a tour. I was put on the 1:40 natural entrance tour. I was a bit disappointed about having to wait that long, but I guess it is to be expected in the busy summer months, and it could have been worse. There was enough to keep me occupied while I waited, including some nice exhibits in their museum and a video about the park in their theater. You should plan on eating before you come here since there is not much in the area for dining, but there was a small vending room here with snacks and even some sandwiches. I would recommend wearing a jacket in the cave, as it was about 53 degrees inside, which was chilly, even on a day that was pretty hot. When it was finally time for my tour, the park ranger tour guide met us in a shelter area for the natural entrance cave tour. Our tour guide was pretty good and seemed knowledgeable about the cave. The tour groups are pretty large here, as I believe there were about 40 people on our tour. Because of that, it could occasionally be hard to hear her if I was further away from where she was talking. The cave itself was pretty fascinating, and I enjoyed getting to tour it. This tour lasted just about 1 1/4 hours, which was a good length--not too short but not too long to get boring. This park is also filled with lots of wildlife and nature above ground, so be sure to drive around a little bit and see other things besides the cave itself. This park butts right up to Custer State Park, which I visited the following day. I would recommend a visit to Wind Cave National Park, but be prepared for long waits for a cave tour. This is a beautiful part of South Dakota!","July 17, 2018",Neat National Park and Interesting Cave,195,"Burlington, Wisconsin",4

On entering the park, I turned to 1600 AM to find that the elevators were out and tours may or may not happen Monday. Sign on door when I arrived. I stayed till open at 8 and the sign came down from the door and I got a tour and a working elevator. I learned they have a Facebook page and you should check it for any announcements.Between this cave and Jewel, I certainly prefer Jewel. However, this is where you see boxwork--not much of it in any other cave in the world.","July 16, 2018",Check their Facebook page before going,56,Seymour,4
Wind Cave National Park,"We love the National Parks and have visited a majority of them. We were looking forward to seeing Wind Cave and drove an hour and a half to get there. Upon arriving, we learn that the cave elevator system is not working and no tours of the cave will be given. It felt a bit like going to the Grand Canyon and finding out you can’t see the canyon. One of the rangers told us that unfortunately this happens frequently. Nothing was mentioned on the park website about the cancellation of the tours. Since the main attraction of the park is the cave, the NPS needs to ensure the elevator system is reliable.","July 15, 2018",Huge Disappointment,4,"Phoenix, Arizona",1

First, below ground, our family did the Natural Entrance Tour. We found it accessible for the whole group ages 4 to 62. The cave is beautiful with its various formations, including its boxwork. The ranger did a great job explaining how the cave was formed and including the kids in the tour.Second, the surface blew us away. While we expected an awesome cave, we did not expect the surface to be filled with so many attractions, particularly wildlife.

Parking was not an issue as there was plenty of space and there is a small gift shop as well. Some visitor centers have restaurants- just a word to the wise this one does not. They have a vending area, but that is it. If you need a meal, you will need to leave the park. We did not have to pay for admission to the park which was great.

Wind Cave National Park,"I'm glad I checked this off of my National Parks list, but I have to say, I wasn't thoroughly impressed, and that's no fault of the guide. It's just... a fairly standard, deep cave. In fact, our guide was excellent and made the experience very interactive and was quite knowledgeable. However, the tour group size was just too big - obnoxiously so, both in size and the people who were in the group. There were 40 participants, and at least 10-15 were all traveling together and were loud, boorish, and quite often rude. There's no need to have groups that big. Lastly, it is chilly (below 60 I think). It didn't bother me, but I could definitely see why people would prefer to have a jacket.All-in-all, it just wasn't for me. The museum is nice, the area outside is neat, and there were a lot of bison at the entry of the park though.","July 11, 2018",Maybe I'm Just Not a Cave Person...,60,"Boston, Massachusetts",3

I will state that even though this tour is recommended for those with children and seniors, a few of the seniors in our tour group had some challenges with the walking. Our tour guide (Ben) was a good story teller and had good information regarding the cave. If you are going to see cool cave formations or bats, you will not see them here.

You cannot bring backpacks or big bags with you into the cave - this includes baby carriers (they can be worn on the front). Rangers will ask you to leave things in your car if possible. Other than a vending machine area there is no food at this park. The nearest food is 20minutes away. If you are visiting during a busy time, tours can be booked out an hour or two.

On a previous visit, we took the ""candlelight"" tour which took us to a different part of the cave that was not lit. Although the ""Fairgrounds"" tour was listed as ""strenuous"" it was far from that and was an easy walk through the cave and up and down stairs.

Wind Cave National Park,I must say Ranger Ben was the best tour guide ever. You can tell he enjoys what he does. There are several flights of stairs you must take but it wasn’t overly strenuous. My parents who are 69 were able to walk it without any issues. I am definitely glad I brought my jacket because it was 50° degrees inside the cave. ,"July 2, 2018",Cool Stop,1,"Starkville, Mississippi",5
Wind Cave National Park,"I knew going in that I would not be doing a cave tour, as I heard from multiple people that Wind Cave is not great if you are claustrophobic. But I love all our national parks and knew Wind Cave had more to offer above ground, so we went here on a cloudy Monday afternoon. Entering from Custer State Park, the visitor center is actually not until the very end of the drive through the park. Keep that in mind in terms of restrooms, having questions for rangers, etc. We came upon the Rankin Ridge trailhead very quickly, and that is a hike I wanted to do. This is a 1 mile loop that climbs a bit and affords you AMAZING views! Seriously do this hike. It is not super difficult and you can take it easy if you need to. We actually saw some bison scat and what we think was a mountain lion pawprint on this trail!From there, we drove the scenic road to the visitor center. The rangers were super helpful and pulled out a book with animal prints so we could see if it was in fact a mountain lion (it sure looked like it!) They also offered some other hikes for us to do. We decided on the Centennial Trail, which is a long trail, but they said the first couple miles were very scenic and indeed they were. We hiked about a mile out and then a mile back and it wound through beautiful vast open prairie. Because most people do the cave tours here, the hiking trails were blissfully empty. We also got to watch some bison playing around in the grass for awhile with not many people around. If you come to Wind Cave, definitely plan some time for above-ground hiking as well.","July 2, 2018",This park is more than just a cave,228,"Peoria, Illinois",5
Wind Cave National Park,The Wind Cave Tours have 3 different tours. Talk to the ticket counter sales person or the ranger which tour meets what your looking to see.

Wind Cave National Park,"Wind Cave NP was really cool. I'd been to Mammoth Cave (Kentucky), and I'd say this was better; more interesting, more unique tour, great historical story. We took the ""natural entrance tour"". If you're claustrophobic you will want to think seriously about going on the tour. My wife is claustrophobic, and initially tried to be a trooper and swallow her fear....but, ended up having to have the ranger escort her out once we got deep into the cave. So long as you can deal with the small spaces (you're always able to stand up, but in some places it's just very narrow where you walk) this is a fantastic cave with some great history, and the park rangers that take you on the tour are very informative. We took 7 kids ages 5-7 as well as a baby, and it was just fine. Taking the baby is probably not the best idea simply because you do have to bend down a few times to get through some spots, but otherwise it wasn't a problem for the mom that carried him in a chest carrier. The kids loved it, and so did the adults. Very unique sidebar from the usual Mount Rushmore stops. No matter what the weather is like outside do take a light jacket as it is cool down in the cave. I wore shorts and a t-shirt and I was fine, but having a jacket would have been better.","July 1, 2018",The Black Hills is More Than Just 4 Heads on a Mountain,68,"Des Moines, Iowa",5

Wind Cave National Park,"PRETOUR: We scheduled a candlelight tour by calling a month in advance (two adults and an 11-year old). Not sure you really need to call that far in advance, but I was concerned the spots would fill fast during mid-June. The NPS asks you to call back again two days before your tour date to confirm the reservation. (Note that they will reserve your spot over the phone for this tour, but you pay when you get there.) The staff I spoke to both for the initial reservation and the confirmation were friendly and briefed me on key details to pass on to my party: wear closed-toe shoes, long sleeves, and layers: no cameras, bags, cell phones; bring jersey gloves if you have them because you’ll be touching the cave walls (the Park Service does have a limited number of gloves available). TOUR: Check in for the tour at the front desk of the visitor center, then pay for your ticket at the Tours counter, and head downstairs to meet your group. 10 people max. The ranger will lead you outside to get equipped with a “lantern” (a small metal pail with an LED light) and gloves, then give a brief talk about safety. You’ll take the elevator down to the starting point, then—if you’re lucky—elevator back up at the end (both elevators went out the day we visited, so we go ended up having to take LOTS of stairs back up, but got a bit of an extra tour for our trouble). This tour is billed as strenuous. While there were steps to navigate and lots of uneven terrain, I didn’t find that the scrambling around got my heart rate up that much. The boxwork formations were stunning, and it was cool to see the cave in a state akin to what early spelunkers might have seen. (My tween niece deemed it ""supercool."") Our guide Alex was knowledgeable, clearly passionate about the beauty and uniqueness of this cave, and had a great sense of humor/stories to share. She also maintained an upbeat vibe despite repeated snarky comments from a couple annoying people in our group, and kept the rest of us engaged. Be aware that this cave is drier and slightly warmer than Jewel Cave (there we needed sweatshirts, but in Wind Cave, we were fine with just long sleeves).","July 1, 2018",Candlelight tour: mildly strenuous fun off the beaten path,32,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",4
Wind Cave National Park,"We are a group of 8 traveling with children aged 15, 11, 11, and 8. We had reservations at the Mammoth Site in the afternoon and we were looking for something to do going that direction from the hotel. Wind Cave was chosen and it was a great choice. My children were excited that they could get yet another national park stamp here. We came and the Natural Entrance Tour was available within an hour of our arrival time. I am told it can get pretty busy later in the summer but we were easily able to get a tour when we arrived. The tour is about an hour long. Our tour guide was very informative and very serious about her job. We walked to the entrance, went through an air lock and proceeded down 3 very narrow sets of stairways. Most of the tour was walking in a line so you had to keep any questions for the three group stops where the cave widened enough to allow for the group to gather together. We were near the very back of the line. There was someone assigned to be the last one and make sure no one was left behind. At the end we went back up via an elevator so we did not have to ascend all the stairs. If you are tall make sure you watch your head as the cave ceiling is not very high. The cave has box work formations which are rare and can only be seen in a few caves. It is different than other caves I have toured so it was highly interesting to me. All of us were able to complete the tour including the 8 year old with no problems.","June 30, 2018",Awesome National Park I didn't know existed.,79,"Conroy, Iowa",5
Wind Cave National Park,"Not the prettiest cave we’ve ever toured, but very interesting indeed. It’s well worth the trip to see and the huge, surrounding national park is a gorgeous drive thru. We did the middle level cave tour which included 300 steps, all of which are down with the exception of 11 short steps up. Not strenuous, a little bit slippery in places so wear good walking shoes. We had a great tour guide. The cave is pretty chilly at 55 degrees so bring a light jacket.","June 30, 2018",Interesting cave,14,"Gloster, Louisiana",5

Wind Cave National Park,"Any type of enclosed area, significant height or significant depth is not my thing. However my family really wanted to do this, so I went. Here is the exact experience I had yesterday ... we went on the Natural Entrance tour which is the most popular. There are three levels of caves, this is the middle one. We met our group of 40 plus one ranger at an outdoor shelter - Maggie, she was outstanding. She gave us some interesting info and rules for the outing (stay together, don’t touch the rock, etc.) then we walked a brief distance to a small natural opening so that we could feel the cool wind blowing out from the caves. It was pretty interesting. We then entered an air lock room with doors on either side. Maggie asked anyone who thought they might need out to speak up - easier to leave the tour now than once we head down. Frankly, that made me start to panic a bit but I kept it together. She assigned one person to always be last so that we didn’t leave anyone behind. We started down a really long set of stone stairs right away. They were lit well enough and had paint outlining each step. The steps are each a bit short for longer feet so sometimes I had to step sideways. We moved single file with one and sometimes two railings on each side. It did feel cramped and like I might panic for the first 10 to 15 minutes. My two tricks were pretending that my kids needed me to help them through the experience and pretending that some of the lights were actually windows and the outside was right there. Once down quite a distance, we entered a series of open spaces (maybe 3) that really helped me feel better. The entire 3/4 of a mile we walked was well lit at all times, though dim still. Maggie shared a lot of interesting info and I convinced myself that I was looking for art project inspiration. There was nothing especially strenuous or tricky about the cave walk - wide range of bodies and ages on the tour. My kids were the youngest at 7 and 9. In one of the rooms, the lights were turned off so that we could experience total darkness. I closed my eyes and pretended the lights were on - otherwise the darkness is claustrophobic. This lasted for roughly 3 minutes. She also used a candle in this room to show what early exploration was like, maybe 5 minutes of that. In the final room, she finally shared how deep we were (250 feet) but would not share earlier since that might make people panic. The exit was much easier - there is an elevator off of that last room. It’s super fast maybe 20 seconds and the ranger takes up 10 people at a time for a total of four trips to get everyone up. It also has an air lock room we had to all enter first. ","June 27, 2018",Exactly what to expect,20,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5
Wind Cave National Park,"This cave is like no other in the world. It has boxwork formations (95% of the worlds formations). You need to take a tour to see the cave. We took the 1 hour Fairgrounds tour (2/3 mile and 450 stairs but not a bad hike). Check web site for times, prices and descriptions of the tours.

One of the Rangers suggested we visit the Mammoth Site in Hot Springs which ended up being a very interesting stopover, an active archeological dig with dozens of well preserved skeletons. We spent an hour there and then made it back in time for our Natural Entrance tour. We had a wonderful Ranger/tour guide Anthony Rivera. He was well informed and entertaining. He kept everyone engaged during the 60+ minute tour. There were over 200 stairs but they all went down, you take an elevator back to the exit but if you have limited mobility this isn’t a good choice.

Wind Cave National Park,"We’ve been to quite a few caves, and Wind Cave is unusual in that it’s mostly a tortuous network of narrow corridors instead of a series of big rooms with stalactites and stalagmites. There are none of the usual cave “ornaments”. Instead, there’s an interesting and not particularly pretty rock formation called “boxwork.” It’s fairly unique to Wind Cave. We took the “original entrance tour”, which gives you a sense of what it was like for the original explorers and explains why the cave is named “Wind Cave.” The demonstration is cool. The guide, from Puerto Rico, was great! We actually enjoyed above ground somewhat more, and can highly recommend the Black Mountain (for birding) and Rankin Ridge (for amazing views) Trails.

My 5 & 8 year old loved it (they earned 4 on our week long trip, all of the national parks/monuments have them). Bring a sweatshirt for the actual tour, it can get chilly. If you are tall, be prepared to duck, the ceiling gets low in places and it can be narrow passages. I am slightly claustrophobic, but we were moving enough that it didn't bother me at all.

Not that it matters because on this tour, you are walking single file down steps and the ranger only speaks to you before the tour begins and maybe 4 times during the tour. At times he would be shining a light on a particular formation as we passed by and he would tell us to look at it. At other times we would be in an open space and he would talk to us for a few minutes.

It involved climbing down about 300 dimly lit and uneven stairs so it's definitely not handicap accessible. For those who are in at least mediocre physical condition though, it's a must-do, the boxwork patterns and other natural formations are exceptionally beautiful. The good news is we exited the cave via a high speed elevator, so we didn't have to spelunk our way back up.

The least strenuous one is the Garden of Eden tour which took 1 hour and 1/3 of a mile and is led by a ranger. Here you will be able to see the boxwork, popcorn and flowstone formations at a leisurely pace. It is important to wear the appropriate foot wear and a light jacket and to follow the rules: no wandering around by yourself and no touching of the formations! Some passageways are low and since you are not wearing a hard hat, be careful and stoop down! Leave your bags, backpacks, purses and strollers in your car as they are not permitted in the cave. Purchase your tickets right away, as its a first come, first served procedure.","October 17, 2017",Watch Your Head!,59,"Honolulu, Hawaii",3
Wind Cave National Park,"We've visited well-known caves in NY, VA and AZ before. We took the Natural Entrance Tour here. The Wind Cave NP cave was the least interesting we have visited. No stalagmites or stalactites and no big soaring chambers, and very little color. The tour follows a narrow corridor mostly down through rock formations. There were some interesting features that we hadn't seen elsewhere, but these were generally small.A couple of positives: our tour guide did an excellent job of trying to make the tour interesting, and the land area atop the cave was beautiful with fall colors. We saw several buffalo in the area.So, not uninteresting, but not exciting.","October 13, 2017",Not Very Exciting,37,"Mystic, Connecticut",3
Wind Cave National Park,"The advance reading I did led me to believe that the above ground features of the Park are a significant part of the attraction. I can't agree. I found the bison herds and other fauna, and the scenery in the neighboring Custer State Park much more impressive than anything above ground in Wind Cave N.P. Maybe there's seasonal movement of the herds. Underground, the size and complexity of the cave, and the unique formations, and the airflow, and the history of its exploration, which the very informed and entertaining guides will discuss, are the real point of visiting. On a Monday late-morning in late September we had no difficulty fitting in to two cave tours without advance reservations. I gather that's more of a gamble in busier tourist season. If there is an advance reservation system, USE IT! I think it could be pretty boring waiting an hour or more with few entertainment or food options. Information is posted about the level of difficulty of the various tours (mostly descending steps) but most seem to ask the ticket-selling staff which adds delays to the process.","October 11, 2017","I've seen more caves than most, the ranger guides still made it interesting",71,"Hallsville, Missouri",4

Wind Cave National Park,"This is a very different cave experience from the caverns I'm used to. There are a lot of steps , mostly down that ultimately takes you 650 feet down with an elevator ride up at the end. The cave is mostly dry, with many narrow paths and low ceilings. At first it's a bit eerie but you get used to it. The tour moves fast with a few stops in a couple of open rooms. Our Ranger guide was informative and funny. We did this on a rainy day with a lot of others who had the same idea. Not everyone could get tour tickets and we waited two hours for our tour to start.

Wind Cave National Park,"I have been to a lot of cave systems including Mammoth Cave in Kentucky. Every cave that I see is different and of course includes Wind Cave.I drove from Mt. Rushmore to Wind-cave. You could potentially visit both parks in 1 day but a little bit of driving involved. The park itself is big (outside of the caves) with prairies and forests. So enjoy the drive, stop when you can to take in the different scenery. Since the whole area is mostly short prairies, there is not much shade if you wish to hike outside. The visitor's center is where you enter the caves, and boy the parking lot was busy !Since they all are guided tours, you are better off visiting during a weekday when the crowds are down. Almost any tour you choose based on your comfort level will be good. Visit the National park website to familiarize with timings and tour length to make the choiceThe cave formations are one of a kind and very interesting. NPS tour guides are always quirky and informative, so they make it more enjoyable. You will see box work and pop-corn that are seldom seen elsewhere.

Wind Cave National Park,"Interesting boxwork and other subtle formations that I had not seen before. Do not expect the stalactites and stalagmites that you see in many caves. You are only allowed in the cave on a guided tour and cannot bring a purse or even a fanny pack due to the narrow passages. Wear good walking shoes The Natural Entrance Tour moves along quickly and covers a lot of ground. If you are taller, be prepared for ducking. After reading on this site about slippery conditions, I expected to take the Garden of Eden tour but a Natural Entrance Tour was starting soon so we decided to take it and did not have any problem. The portion of the park away from the visitor center is peaceful with great views. After taking the cave tour we rode around the park, saw bison and a group of antelope, and took the Rankin Ridge Trail (reviewed separately).","September 25, 2017","Enjoy the whole park, not just the cave",142,New Jersey,5

Wind Cave National Park,"We wanted to take the tour, especially since we toured Jewell Cave, but the timing was not good for us. However, the reason for the rating is the handling of the tour schedule in the visitor center. There was no posted schedule so you needed to stand in line to find out what was available and the times. It was really irritating. Our experience in NPS centers had been more visitor friendly with posting tours and program times. The exhibits were nice so we had to settle for that.

While the passages are narrow and low, they are easy to get through, with stops in wider ""rooms"". Other tours are available, including one that uses an elevator for down as well as up, a candlelight tour, and a real caving tour that involves crawling.

Wind Cave National Park,"We visited Wind Cave in late August, went on a $12 per person tour that lasted just over an hour. There are a variety of tours to match folk's walking abilities, some use the elevator both directions while others have longer distances with stairs. Pick what suits your needs! We loved the tour and thought the Ranger really brought the history and the cave to life. You see interesting rock formations, get a feel for what it must have been like to be a first explorer in the Cave plus experience the total blackness of the cave with the lights are put out very briefly. One couple left the tour right at the start, not for them I guess. This slowed things down a bit as the Ranger had to lead them out. Another couple had a 16 month old in a front pack (only kind allowed) and the poor kid just wanted to get down and move around. I would suggest leaving younger children at the surface, the walking and stairs are not too difficult but I just don't think they would enjoy it. After the tour we drove around the park a bit and went on a 4.5 mile hike in the woods and grasslands. To our surprise a bison blocked the trail at one point, a bit scary as signs indicate that they can move at 35 mph. We did a very wide loop around him and continued on. Bathrooms, water and a small gift shop are in the visitor's center.","September 11, 2017",Be sure to explore both above and below in this Park,46,"Wellesley, Massachusetts",4
Wind Cave National Park,"We arrived about 15 minutes before 11 am and the ticket line was short. They offer 3 different tours but there was not a lot of information posted in the ticket area on the difference between them, so based on TripAdvisor reviews, we went for the natural entrance tour, which was 1 hour and 45 minutes. There are a specific number of tickets for each time slot. The couple in front of us got the tickets for the next tour which was in about 10 minutes - apparently the last ones for that time slot - so we had to wait about half an hour for our tour. While we waited we went into the gift shop and there on the wall is a sort of map of the cave that shows the different tours marked in different colors. That would have been helpful to see before we purchased tickets. If you are using the ""Senior"" US Parks pass to purchase tickets, be aware that one is required for each person, so you need to think ahead whether you want to buy the extra pass before the rates go up. We were told that Jewel cave also requires one pass per person. We hadn't had that opportunity, and were not planning to go to Jewel cave, so we just paid the extra price for the second ticket. The gift shop is small and hard to spend a lot of time in, but there is a room off the main ticket room that has displays and information that can occupy some time. They have an area with some lunch type tables and chairs and a couple of over-priced vending machines with drinks and snacks. The tour includes over 300 stairs, but our tour guide assured us that only 11 of them were ""up"". We enjoyed the tour a lot. Thought it was a fun experience. When we came back to the lobby after the tour, to use the restroom before heading out, there was a long ticket line and the parking lot was crowded. Best to go early if you want to avoid a long wait.","September 11, 2017",An interesting tour.,521,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5
Wind Cave National Park,"Wind Cave National Park is a really cool place to visit in a part of the country with so many beautiful natural wonders. This Park has several cave tours--we went on the Natural Entrance tour in the morning and it was a bit over an hour long. The tour has some stairs to go down and you take an elevator back up. It was quite enjoyable and so neat to see this very dry cave with the amazing and rare boxwork formations all over. Definitely do a cave tour and also drive the rest of the park to see the above ground sights. We can many prairie dog towns, coyotes, bison, pronghorn, etc....it was great.

Wind Cave National Park,"Was headed to the cave and my maps app sent me down a dead end. So a little advice - follow the signs and the map given to you when entering the park. Also, not a lot of internet service - so map your destination ahead of time and take notes just in case. The wildlife is plentiful. The cave visit is guided and can only have 25-30 people at a time. So plan on waiting a tad. There is a video available and you can see the original wind cave opening before or after your tour. There are two types of tours - one that has a lot of steps and the other that doesn't. We had to go the lesser step route because of health issues. I don't think you can go wrong with either. The cave is unique but not the most dynamic cave as far as the Oo! Ah! Moment. What it is known for is the size of the cave. It has miles and miles of trails and only 10% of them have been identified! I'd recommend it to someone who just wants to see everything they can in the area but not necessarily recommend to the CAVE adventures, unless you are certified to venture on your own!

Wind Cave National Park,"Of course, there's the cave at the little-known Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota. Various Ranger-led tours there take visitors into this sixth largest cave in the world, mostly on steps and thin passageways -- not for those who even have hints of claustrophobia. No matter that there are no stalagmites or stalactites in this dry cave -- there is something inherently dramatic about standing some space that is 20 stories under ground. But the Wind Cave above ground is what is truly unexpected about this place. The largely treeless landscape where the Rockies and the Plains collide allows easy viewing of bison herds and other wildlife. In fact, it is much easier to see bison at Wind Cave than it is on the vaunted Wildlife Loop Road in nearby Custer State Park where they often stay out of view. I saw one bison there by the parking lot at the state park visitor center, while I saw dozens of bison at Wind Cave. It may be a lesser known park but it is most definitely worth a visit.","September 6, 2017",Great Park Below & Above Ground,104,"Bainbridge Island, WA",5
Wind Cave National Park,"Many tours in this cave make it very accessible and the paths provide very good footing.

Wind Cave National Park,"Despite the best efforts of our knowledgeable guide, Adam, we found our natural entrance tour of the cave rather underwhelming. Our guide emphasised the uniqueness of the boxwork weathering in the cave but after a while this wore thin in the absence of the usual decorative features found in caves. Names like ""the cathedral"" for rather small spaces seemed like wishful thinking. We were also surprised by how dark the passages were, making it awkward for some members of our party. Having so many people in the group meant that explanations could not be given except in the few areas large enough for everyone. Smaller groups would make for a better visit for all.

Wind Cave National Park,"We did this cave tour second after Jewel Cave the preceding day, with our 12, 9, and 6 year old kids. For those that are trying to decide which one to visit, it is a tough call! Jewel Cave had smaller tour groups, which made the experience better and less chaotic. Our guide at Wind Cave was super knowledgeable, and taught us a lot, but spent much of the tour trying to compare the cave to a living human which was kind of odd in my opinion. The cave itself is very interesting, with box work that apparently can't be seen anywhere else, but they allow people to take flash pictures ad nauseum, and we found it difficult to walk through the dark with flashes in our eyes. Jewel Cave told us their rule is no flash photography while people are walking, and reminded people to be respectful - it made a difference! Also at Wind Cave, our tour group was 40 people, which was just too many to be as enjoyable. We had to often wait to hear the explanation from the tour guide because we were farther back in the group. It didn't help that someone had an over-tired toddler along that cried for a good share of the tour! If I had to pick just one, I think I would pick Jewel Cave, but Wind Cave is definitely cool looking if you can make it to both!

There are multiple tours you can take that suit all activity/ability levels. The interior is well lit with sturdy paths, stairs, and railings. The various types of crystals we saw were lovely and the 'boxwork', which is the special feature of this cave, was enchanting. But the Park is so much more than the below-ground cave. We saw lots of bison (and sat and waited for lots of bison to get off the #@$# road so we could go on) and prairie dogs. There are a number of hiking trails. We did the self-guided Nature Trail near the main Park buildings and also hiked the Rankin Ridge trail.

Sarah explained all the mysteries and discoveries of Wind Cave and told us many fascinating stories about its past. She also let us experience firsthand how explorers in the 1800's could only walk around with candles to light the way, and how it felt when there was no light at all...

[PRO HINT: When going into the station walk immediately to the back, the front desk is just for information; the back desk is for ticket sales]. We returned at 4:30 and watched the slightly informative video. Tours begin by going downstairs and out the back to the gazebo; wait there for your ranger. Our tour involves about a mile of walking, about 400 stairs going down (none go up), and some pretty narrow passages. If you are over 5'10"" you will need to duck at times. Ranger Adam was friendly and informative even though it was his last tour of the day. The tour was interesting for the box formations that are mostly unique to this cave. There are many crevasses and the whole tour actually is a series of tiered rooms. At the end, fortunately, there is an elevator to take you the 20-stories back to the surface.It was worth the $12 charge but if you are pressed for time and not really into caves you can safely pass this one by.

Temp is a consistent 54 degrees- need a jacket but otherwise we were in shorts and keen sandals. Ranger Holly was fantastic, but again I don't enjoy caves so wasn't a highlight of my trip.

Wind Cave National Park,"I had never heard of Wind Cave until I purchased a National Park book early in my trip. It is not well advertised even within the state of South Dakota. We arrived mid morning and cave tours were already sold out so we took the short 1 hour tour. It's not a sparkly cave like some people usually see. It has a lot of boxwork rock which is interesting in its own right. The 1 hr tour does not show you much of the cave but if you are short on time it might suffice. We did nothing else within the park, so maybe we missed missed things that might have raised my rating.","August 19, 2017",A short visit,18,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",3
Wind Cave National Park,"I was excited about Wind Cave but it fell short of my expectations. Our tour guide had trouble making eye contact during the tour and seemed very uncomfortable talking to the group. The tour was nice but the cave was underwhelming after we took the tour of Jewel Cave the following day. If you have time to do both, go for it but if you have to pick one I would go with Jewel.","August 18, 2017",Good but a better option down the road.,54,"Huntersville, North Carolina",3
Wind Cave National Park,We thoroughly enjoyed visiting this national cave. The guided tour was well worth the $6 admission rate for seniors. TRY TO GEWT AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE!!!! There are three different tours depending on the number of stairs you want to climb. We took the middle tour and found it to be very enjoyable. The easiest is the Garden of Eden with 150 steps and 1 hour long. The second is the Natural Entrance Tour with 300 steps mostly down and 1 hr and 15 minutes. The longest one is the Fair Ground Tour with 450 steps and about 1 1/2 hrs long. The cost is the same for all three tours.,"August 15, 2017",6th Longest Cave in the World - 25 stories deep!

Wind Cave National Park,"We planned a long day so that we could not only visit the cave, but travel all of the roads nearby and go through Custer State Park as well. By going early we were treated to sights of prairie dogs and herds of buffalo that at times blocked the road as they walked right by our car. The cave itself is great to tour, with knowledgeable guides -- and it was great to get in out of the heat for a while.

Wind Cave National Park,"Wind Cave is supposed to be one of the longest and most complex in the world. But what, I believe, was even better, was the herd of bison grazing once we reached the park grounds. Our guide was knowledgeable and explained how the cave was discovered and why it is called Wind Cave.

Both my boys were also asked to help direct the group again later in the tour. They felt so special and beamed with pride. The guide was very friendly, although the info given was way to scripted but I guess it's to be expected.

Wind Cave National Park,"Get there early as busses begin bringing tour groups @ 10AM. This is one of the largest caves in the world and it offers several different tours to select from. There is an easy tour with limited climbing, another tour with 200 steps over the course of the tour and another longer tour and finally one where you get to crawl in certain areas. When you arrive at the visitors center you pick up the info re the tours and queue up. If you have a NP pass you receive a discounted tour. You select your tour and the ranger tells you your time. You then go and watch a very interesting movie about the caves, their history and discovery which is still occurring today. Our guide for the climbing tour was excellent. He answered all of our questions and took his time showing us the crystals and designs. This was a dry cave; unlike others we had been in so the features were very different. Take a light weight jacket as it is only @ 50 in the cave and the tour took over an hour.","August 5, 2017","Great park, great caves, very unique",483,"Ridgefield, CT",5

Wind Cave National Park,"First, know that you may only take a small ""bag"" on the tour. Your camera will fit, but not much else. The line starts to form at about 7 AM, so get there early or plan to wait in line for the various tours. Check out the different tours on- line ahead of time so you have some knowledge of what tour you are interested in. There is also a ""rock"" that you can crawl through to see if you can go on the wild tour. Also, be reminded that you can not wear shoes in this cave that have been worn in other caves, so if you are a frequent traveler, be prepared. The tour is nice, especially if you have not been on other cave tours. Rangers are knowledgeable and my kids really enjoyed a ""patio talk"" about the various animals found in the area. The ranger had fur for the kids to touch.","August 2, 2017","Nice National Park - get there early to avoid the long, long lines",17,"Richmond, Virginia",3

Wind Cave National Park,"I hadn't heard of Wind Cave National Park before I started planning my trip to South Dakota, but I wished I had set aside a whole day instead of just part of the day. How long you decide to spend here depends on your area of interest and what you want to do. It may not be as interesting to everyone as it was for me. This park's combines caves and geology with forest/prairie conservation. One of the cave tours is a must, but you have to arrive early to get tickets. There are a number of tour styles, and they are very clear about who should do each tour. I did the Fairgrounds tour, but it's not recommended for young children because there are 400+ stairs and it's about 1.5 hours. The visitor center can get hectic at times, and if you're going to do a picnic, I'd suggest trying one of the areas away from the visitor center. There is no food for sale here, so make it a picnic lunch. I only had time for the Prairie Vista trail, but would've liked to hike some of the longer trails. I did not camp here, but I later found out from a friend that this is a great park for camping, and that it's less crowded than some of the other nearby parks. As per usual for every National Park I visit, the rangers were friendly and knowledgeable. There are bison and other animals in the park as well, although not as much as in nearby Custer State Park.","July 31, 2017",Great park combining caves with forest/prairie conservation,8,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5
Wind Cave National Park,"So for one thing, it is not actually ""windy"" inside. The movement of the wind is related to the difference in atmospheric pressure between the cave and the surface. So your hair and clothes will not blow around when you are in the cave ;-) The cave, though, is a dry cave (no water) and this created all kinds of cool stuff that you do not find in other caves that have water. The boxwork/lacework is pretty amazing. The beaded crystals everywhere are neat, too. It is fragile and delicate and a sacred place. We loved it.","July 30, 2017",Wind Cave is Pretty Special,55,"Birmingham, Alabama",5

Hats off to the Park Service and their summer volunteers. Many are repeat volunteers with outstanding knowledge of the Park and history. The tour was the Natural Entrance tour which was about and hour and a quarter. It went down into the caves walking at a leisurely pace with frequent stops for presentations by guide. It was extremely informative and entertaining as well as a great experience to go down into the caverns and listen about the stories and discovery and exploration. None in the party between 9 and 68 were ever bored or felt as though the adventure was not worthwhile. The caverns and formations were really cool as my grandkids said. The walk is mostly down hill with a few tight places and steps mostly down with handrails. Highly recommend for anyone in family.

There was ONE National Park worker behind the desk doing tickets, it was a colossal waste of time that resulted in a lot of frustration for many people. This was our family's first cave experience and we thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was. I would say that we were expecting to see more formations not understanding the differences in caves. But we were wowed by what we did see and I would say our tour was definitely made my our guide.

Wind Cave National Park,"So essentially the cave is very unique when it comes to caves with the differences in certain stone features, yet its very similar to simply any cave. This isn't something negative as I feel like one cannot get tired of caves but if you are the type of person that thinks, I've seen one therefore I've seen them all, then this will be just like any other cave. The external wilderness is nice but nothing compared to the other parks nearby. The tours themselves were interesting, small enough, and lengthy to the point they were still interesting but not too long and the process was seamless.

Wind Cave National Park,"Our guide Cara was great. Follow ranger directions and it will be a very cool experience. 10 inch high by 30 inches wide isn't as small as it sounds, however, wiggling through it is required. The 50+year old who'd never done serious caving before was a little freaked out, but the other 50+ year old and two 20 somethings thought it rocked...literally and figuratively. No bats down that far into the cave. Gloves, all about knee pads, long pants...oh yeah...all that. If you are at all claustrophobic, we would not recommend this, but if it's just new to you you'll be ok once you get your head around the situation. It's worth it.

You literally see everything unique about the cave in the first 300ft or so, and everything after that is just more of the same. Sure, the cavern size might fluctuate and some areas have more lights than others, but it's all the same in reality. Add to that a tour guide that was so impersonal, and very bad at getting the group excited, and i'd say this tour was a huge waste of time and money. The only cool part was at the end when they turn out all of the lights in the cavern and it was literally absolute black...but then a bunch of people started talking and ruined it for everyone. Oh, and our guide's ""special surprise"" in one of the bigger rooms was to ""turn on an additional light."" I don't know if he expected us to be wowed by what was on the ceiling, but no one was.Would definitely never do this cave tour again.

Our tour guide was excellent and had tons of knowledge and jokes. Obviously if you don't like tight spaces, this isn't for you, but if you can brave it, this is definitely worth your time. The cave tours are really not that strenuous, some stairs, and a decent amount of walking, but nothing the average person can't handle. The cave isn't too far from Mt Rushmore (less than an hour), so if you're in the area, definitely check this place out.

There are several tours available of different lengths and physical requirements. There are even candlelight tours and wild cave tours that require you to crawl through tiny shafts.

We had to wait about 45 minutes till the next available one. (We chose the shortest tour for time's sake). The wait was no problem because that gave us time to look around the exhibits, watch the short movie, and check out the little gift shop.No bags, food, water, gum, etc. are allowed to be taken on the Cave tours, so be sure to leave them in your car. The Cave was very interesting to learn about and our guide had lots of good stories to tell. We kinda felt she was talking to us like we were grade schoolers though. My boys (ages 15, 11, and 7) were not all that impressed with the Cave. Our youngest didn't understand why we couldn't climb around and explore the Cave. There's a separate tour that does allow you to do that. This tour has some neat formations to see: the frost, popcorn, and the box work. But nothing is lit up in different colors, there's nothing real amazing to a kid to see. It seemed slow too. It was interesting, but I don't think I'd be interested in doing it again. We really debated on visiting this Cave or Jewel Cave because we knew we didn't have time for both. We were extremely happy with the above ground park, but kinda disappointed in the Cave.","July 8, 2017",Beautiful Park,75,"Little Rock, AR",4
Wind Cave National Park,"If you have plenty of time on your hands, this tour is okay. But you must be there early as the park does NOT sell tour tickets in advance like other national park caves. You have to wait get there and then buy your tickets and wait around an hour or more until your tour time because they won't let you in unless you're on a tour. And you can't take a self guided tour like other national park caves.

Wind Cave National Park,"Unfortunately we did not get to do a cave tour as we arrived at the visitor center in the afternoon. I don't understand why the NPS won't take non-refundable reservations. There is so much going on in the Black Hills, getting there, getting a tour signed up and then having to wait over 3 hours just isn't doable for many people. The visitor center and staff were very nice. The lands were great too, saw some bison and plenty of prairie dogs. Don't miss out on the history of the park and the lands outside of the caves. I have a feeling it would have been 5 stars if I had gotten into the caves, but again, the lack of reservations hampers the park.

We purchased tickets ahead of time online, but it didn't save us any time when we got to the park because we still had to stand in line to get actual tickets for the tour, so I wouldn't recommend purchasing in advance. Plan to arrive early! Tours fill up quickly. If you're driving from Rapid City, allow yourself more time than you think you'll need to get there.

Our Ranger was great-very informative. It's stressed it will be a cool temp in the cave-I didn't find it to be so. You're moved pretty quickly through the tour and there's a lot of steps.

Wind Cave National Park,"When i think of a cave ,I dont equate it with a national park. THat is the case here at wind cave. there is an a lot of wildlife on the grounds here including bison,deer,antelope, and prarie dogs. the roads into the park and the surounding area are quite nice to see as well. Below ground the visitor center offers 4 different tours to go on,each with its own difficulty rateing. I would do some homework first and decide what tour you want go on before ariving. You can get all this info from the web page. The next best thing i can tell you is to arrive early!!! advanced reservations are ""not excepted"" and tickets for all tours can and do sell out by noon and even early than that on busy days. This is popular place to visit with tourist and local schools, and tour busses. Tickets are for sale only on the day of. A good secondary stratagy would be to come here and buy your tickets for latter in the day , leave go to the mammoth hot springs and return later. We got here at 10 am on a tuesday in june and almost missed out on the 10.30 natural entrance tour. luck has it we got some of the last ones left. each tour does include some hiking and walking down stairs (alot of them) the good news is there is an elevator to take you back up.  The rangers are informative and have alot good stories to share. at times the cave can seem very dark and a little claustraphobic. not too worry the cave is lit with electric light and the tight spaces are only a few. You can expect to see some interesting features here but suprisingly not the common stalagtights or mights is most caves.  The tours last about an hour and a half or less. and if you are new to the whole cave experience you will need to bring a light jacket inside with you because the cave is always 50 degrees regardless what the outside tem is. THe tours are suitable for all family members except hadicap. this is not wheelchair accesable . The visitor center has a film, rangers , restrooms, and exibits to see, there is no food available for sale here so plan accordingly.

Wind Cave National Park,"I live near some of the most impressive caves in America, and although this cave is quaint, it has some unique features that make it worth a visit. The unique boxworks formations found in this cave system are really neat, and you're likely to never see them again. The ranger, Mary Laycock, was sooo enthusiastic about the cave, and her excitement was contagious. She was so fun and personable, while being obviously the most knowledgeable person on the grounds. She made the tour worth every penny! *Note: National Park Passes are not valid for tours here, although those holding the Senior National Park Pass do get a discount. **Bring a sweatshirt (temps are 56 degrees F*) and comfy shoes. You'll be walking for an hour and 20 mins, up and down stairs, and in small, cramped cavern tunnels.

Wind Cave National Park,"We went on the Natural Entrance tour of Wind Cave. The ranger who led our tour was very friendly and knowledgeable. There are about 300 stairs, but they are mostly all downward. There are lots of railings. We had a 5 year old child with us, and she made it with no trouble (in fact, she loved it) the ranger has some flashlights tucked away for those who don't love it quite as much. You learn a lot about the cave, but also about the men of the CCC who did so much to make it what it is now. I would certainly recommend the tour, as the boxwork is very different from the cave formations I have seen before. The only thing to be aware of is that the ranger isn't able to keep up a continual presentation because much of your time is spent single file moving to the next spot where she can speak. Not a criticism at all, just different than what you might have experienced with other caves or smaller groups. Enjoy!","June 29, 2017",Natural Entrance Tour,6,"Tulare, California",5

I do not recommend for kids younger than 5. The babies just can handle it, alot of crying. No bathroom. one parent had to carry of bag of pee most of the way because the kid HAD TO GO! Lol! Hard to hear the guide talk over the whinging and crying of so many really little kids...

It was the best place to see animals on a very crazy, rushed trip through five states in five days--don't ask! But loved the journey, visiting many national parks. Reinforced how beautiful our country is, and how friendly so many people are around country. Americans should visit our national parks! And we all should protect them.

Wind Cave National Park,"My husband and I wanted to see Wind Cave National Park upon arriving I spoke with the ranger about walking conditions, stairs, and asked about speed in which I would be able to travel being that I was only 90 since a total knee replacement. I was told the walk was not a hard walk and we would be taking our time to enjoy the cave environment,and I could not take a walking stick. They offered a three legged seat cane that was bulky and clumsy. So I declined the offer. Our Group was 39 people, with Ranger Lauren. After getting down the elevator we were told we were behind schedule and would have to keep a faster pace. The cave was nice of what we were allowed to see, she would not let us take time for photos, and we were in a constant walk with low light and with multiple aged customers. A gentleman who also had asked about conditions because of bad knees was told the same as I was we would take our time. Didn't happen and he fell half way through which caused us to then come to a standstill until Ranger Lauren could get him assistance, after that we are again hurried to the end because they had a time schedule. We again did not get to hear about the cave or take photos because we were on a fast walk. This Ranger needs a reality check and has a very poor personality. She is working for the taxpayers and should have some consideration for senior citizens and those with disabilities. Had we been able to take our time this would not have happened!!  She made us walk fast because of tour times, then spent 15 minutes telling stories. Maybe there should be an older guide with a personality and respect for Senior Citizens and taxpayers, guiding like customers. I did not enjoy this tour and felt I was not told the truth. If I was to do this again I would ask who the guide is and if they have experience with older citizens with simple disabilities.","June 10, 2017",Typical Government Attitude!!!

We enjoyed that leisure drive, the weather was nice, stopped here and there for some scenic photos. Oh, those prairie dogs! Haven't seen so many since Teddy Roosevelt N.P. up in North Dakota. Same with the Bisons. Plenty to see, all enjoying the grazing and sunshine. Then, just keep on driving into the beautiful Black Hills...","March 17, 2017",Love those Prairie dogs and the Bison,368,"Lemont, Illinois",4
Wind Cave National Park,"We went into the cave, it was an excellent tour, took an hour, deep into the cave, good history and information delivered, our tour guide Lindsay was really patient with the young kids who didn't understand the magnitude of this sacred place.

Wind Cave National Park,"Wind Cave is unique from many other caves in that it has less active water flow. Less water means fewer dripstone formations, or speleothems, such as the stalactites and stalagmites common in other caves. The most common sight in Wind Cave is boxwork. Boxwork formations are an uncommon structure of honeycomb-patterned projecting calcite from cave walls. Except boxwork, there are also many formations that often seen in other normal caves found here in Wind Cave like dripstones, calcite rafts, gypsum flowers, vugs, moonmilk, frostwork, and popcorn. Visiting Wind Cave is like being in a magical world of all the most beautiful and fragile structures. Words can't describe enough how beautiful and unusual this cave formations are. This is definitely a must see place when visiting South Dakota.","March 3, 2017",Awesome and Unusual Cave - A Must See Place,211,"Fresno, California",5

Allow plenty of time in case the next scheduled tour is full and you have to adjust to the next scheduled time. It could take over an hour to wait, but the wait is worth it. Be sure to take a jacket! Even if it is 100 degrees outside, it will be about 50 in the cave!  Also take the time to walk past the visitor center to see the original entrance to the cave (if you do this after the tour you will have the background information and both adults and children will get more out of it!).

All require a guide because the cave system is so complex anybody could get easily lost. It will require as much as an hour or more wait to take your tour, but it is worth it.Wind Cave is unique because most of the calcium carbonate formations are not in the form of stalactites and stalagmites, but unusual formations, some looking like spider webs.

We then went into the cave and began the tour - it was great. Wind Cave is known for it's boxwork and the rangers gave really great explanations of what it is and how it was created.

Wind Cave National Park,"Wind Cave National Park was a pleasant surprise. I had never heard of the park prior to our visit, and, driving through it had not been planned. We were just passing through it on our way to Mount Rushmore and it was one of my favorite parts of our road trip. The wildlife sightings were far more varied and numerous than we had anticipated. We passed by hundreds (maybe thousands) of prairie dogs, at least 30 bison, at least 20 mule deer, antelope, and a badger!! There were so many prairie dogs in some areas that it looked like the earth was moving. It was neat watching them scurry around the ground. They were everywhere.Several bison stayed close to the street. We passed by several bison and deer just a few feet away from us along the road. We had to drive at snail speed to get by some of the bison and because there was one munching on something in the middle of the road with three friends on either side of him. Bison are remarkable creatures. Their size is impressive.","November 29, 2016",Incredible Wildlife,344,"Boynton Beach, Florida",5

Wind Cave National Park,"We visited Wind Cave National Park in the southern Black Hills in South Dakota recently. One of my hobbies is caving so I am trying to write this from a tourist’s view rather than that of a caver. Our guide was “Ranger Lauren” giving her second to last tour of her season. She seemed very engaged with her work as a tour guide. She showed numerous examples of Wind Cave’s most prominent feature, that being the interesting boxwork formations. Wind Cave is a very dry cave and therefore there are not really any active or “live” speleothems. So, you won’t see flowstone, stalagmites or stalactites in Wind Cave. There are lots of stair steps down into the bottom of the cave with only a few steps in the upward direction. As a tour cave, Wind Cave is nicley lighted, has an interesting layout of following fractures and joints under the earth. My favorite part of the tour was actually right at the beginning on the surface where we were all able to closely view the very small natural entrance to the cave.My biggest disappointment with the tour is that the ranger guide seemed to come up with her own names for the different rooms we visited. Looking at the Wind Cave map brochure after the tour, I realized that she never once announced that we were within a room or passage as named on the map. That made it difficult to try to determine afterward where we were when she told a story or passed information to us. Nor does it do justice to the many cavers who surveyed and mapped the cave, and who named various passages and rooms based on their experiences within the cave.I have been in several other tourist caves in other states which I feel are more interesting and certainly prettier to look at. I rate this tour as a 3.","October 6, 2016",A-MAZE-ing Cave,187,"Billings, Montana",3

Kid is wheelchair bound, however the Ranger staff- Ina Winter- was very accommodating and we were able to go into 2 rooms via elevator. It's very different than Carlsbad, and Kartchner and Colossal in AZ, I guess due to the manner it was formed- there are no stalagtites/stalagmites, drapery, bacon, etc. Wind Cave is a ""tight"" cave- narrow passageways, low head space and without the large ""rooms"" of the other Caverns. The boxwork (think that's what it ws called) was different, but not visible to me on the abbreviated tour.

Wind Cave National Park,"Wind Cave is one of the oldest National Parks (1906, if I recall correctly). In retrospect, it doesn't seem to meet my expectations of a National Park when Custer State Park, while something completely different, should merit National Park status before Wind Cave. Regardless, it's a great place to visit if you are travelling in the Black Hills. The cave tours are great, but the small, cramped, undulating caverns are less impressive than Carlsbad Caverns or Mammoth Cave. Still, the cave is exceptional and the extend of explored caverns continues to grow each year. That feature alone is amazing. Should you choose to visit, here's a few tips:- Arrive early to avoid crowds, especially in the busy summer months.- Purchase tickets online in advance if you do plan to travel in late June, July or August.- Bring a jacket if you get cold easily. I found the underground temperature comfortable considering the 100 degree temperatures topside. Too bad you can't stay underground longer!- Be patient in the long, narrow parking lot. - Camp at the nearby campground! There are no hookups and they don't take reservations, but it sure is convenient.- Take some time to drive and even hike throughout the expansive above ground area of the park. There are great trails and some wildlife (best opportunities are morning and evening). But, Custer State Park just North of Wind Cave offers more hiking opportunities.- There isn't much else around Wind Cave, so take any needed food and supplies with you.","September 20, 2016",How to Enjoy Wind Cave,472,"Lexington, Kentucky",4
Wind Cave National Park,"Although this might be a lesser known National Park, it was definitely an amazing experience, and I wish we had had a bit more time to explore it. First off, I definitely recommend a cave tour. There are several options to choose from. I would get there early to ensure you get a spot, but it didn't seem as busy after school was back in session. The Fairgrounds Tour was about an hour, 20 minutes. The tour guide was helpful and gave us a lot of background on the cave. So besides the cave part of this park, there's also a whole bunch of wildlife. We saw bison, pronghorn, and prairie dogs, all from the side of the road. There are lots of trails to do even more exploring (although we weren't able to this time, they looked really cool). You can also drive north through the park, drive alongside Custer State Park, and head straight up to Mount Rushmore (and really maximize your nature/wildlife viewing).

I did the 4 hour Wild Cave tour and thought it was great. This is a cave not known for its idyllic features, but it is pretty unique as far as caves go. The boxwork is impressive and the standout feature. The other thing that stood out is the complexity of the cave system.

Wind Cave National Park,"Be sure to arrive very early to make tour arrangements - the tours at both area caves can sell out during the busy season. This was the first time we had been to a dry cave - the box work and popcorn was very cool. We really enjoyed the cave! Unfortunately, our ranger-led tour was less than what we had expected. There were extremely long walks between stops and many times we were told of things before we got to them, but they weren't pointed out was we passed them. There was a very interesting story about how the cave was discovered, but it was told so poorly, it left us asking many questions. Perhaps you will have a better tour with a different guide.","September 12, 2016",Interesting dry cave - tour was fair.,5,"Boston, Massachusetts",4

Wind Cave National Park,"This cave is amazing and the intricacies of its box work, popcorn and other formations are beautiful to behold. For visitors who have toured caves in other regions of the country, caves in the Western US are generally quite different. While the eastern US have caves that contain many formations such as stalagmites and stalagmites, flow stone, ribbons, bacon, etc., western caves tend to be drier and therefore less formations exist. That being said, Wind Cave is very impressive in its size, length and history and does contain some of the formations you might expect. Unfortunately for whatever reason, the NP service has in its wisdom decided to have fewer tours, but increase the size of the tours to an almost unmanageable size (40+ visitors). In the narrow and sometimes steep confined spaces of the cave, this causes an almost unbearable situation. It becomes even more difficult when there is a mentally challenged individual in the group. You actually see very little of the cave (2/3 mile I recall) due to the logistics of moving this many people and trying to share a few interesting facts with the large group. A suitable alternative is Jewel Cave NP with is close by and keeps their tours smaller on a more frequent timetable.","September 11, 2016",Nice Cave - Tour Not So Good,32,"Blue Ridge, Georgia",4

Wind Cave National Park,"We spent 2 days in the park and were thrilled with the entire experience. The ""above ground"" portion is beautiful with great easy hiking, wild life and more. The cave itself is only accessible with a guided tour. We took 2 - the natural entrance tour and a wild cave tour. The natural entrance tour is an easy, mostly downhill tour that gives you some great history about the discovery of the cave system and just a glimpse at what the cave has to offer. The Wild Cave tour is reservation only and pretty intense. There was lots of crawling, scrambling, and ""don't fall into that pit"" with only the light from participant's headlamps. Our guide, Sheena, was amazing and told us not only about the history of the cave since it was ""discovered"" by white settlers over a century ago, but also the Lakota history and lore of the cave. If you're physically fit and feel good about small dark spaces, I would HIGHLY recommend this 4 hour tour. The entire park is less busy than any other NP I've been to and, while I love the lack of crowds, I feel like this is one of the best and most missed / under appreciated parks. Make a point to put it on your itinerary. ","September 10, 2016",Under appreciated park - a must visit!,178,"Loveland, Colorado",5

We arrived late in the day but was able to get a tour of this special cave. We had a great tour guide that brought up many questions for the mind to ponder about. It was not so physical of a trip thru the cave and there was a elevator to take us up at the end. a welcomed sight. We took the easiest tour tho.

Big kudos to the NPS ranger, very nicely moderated and entertained the crowd. Hiking wise, we did the Wind Cave Canyon trail, a fairly short trail, but not too spectacular, didn't see any birds or owls that we read about. Next one was Centennial and back via Lookout Point Trail (#4). The junction of these trails were not marked unfortunately, a sign would be nice. Overall this was a 1.5h hike, a bison on the trail got our heart rate a little up. The last trail was the Ranking Ridge Trail, also very short, 20-30mins or so, but nice outlooks.On our ride back to Rapid City, a huge bison herd crossed our way on the road, must have been 100s ... so many.

Admission is free, but the cave tours had a reasonable fee. We chose an hour long tour which led us down (300 steps) into the cave. Our guide, Sina Eagle Bear, gave us an informative tour of the cave and its formation, as well as stories of the Lakota people and their history associated with the caves. At the conclusion of the tour, you are transported back to earth on elevators. It's a worthwhile experience.","September 7, 2016",Great experience,131,"Oakmont, Pennsylvania",5

It is not very strenuous, although it does involve a fair number of stairs as you go down into the cave. The formations are beautiful, and our tour guide was both informative and entertaining. There are some sections that are somewhat tight (you have to turn sideways a bit, and taller people will have to watch their heads at times), but I never felt claustrophobic. You'll want a jacket, as it is in the low 50s underground year round.

The reviewer is just shy of 6.5 feet tall, so this was important. :-)The cave contains a variety of interesting rock formations including the famous Wind Cave ""box work"", the calcite left behind when the limestone is surrounded dissolved away.

My friends and I take the 2/3 mile Natural Entrance Cave tour that lasts 1¼ hours.We enjoy walking through narrow passageways to see the “Post Office” with slots for sorting mail, the majestic “Church” where marriage ceremonies are still held and the large “Assembly Room.”  I'm are glad we have flashlights to more closely examine the most distinctive feature of the cave, boxwork. Wind cave contains the most abundant and well formed boxwork in the world. Boxwork are thin projections of calcite that protrude from the walls and ceiling of the cave forming a honeycomb pattern.The cave was discovered by settlers in 1881 when the Bingham brothers heard loud whistling in the woods. They followed the sound to the cave’s natural opening. The wind, which is created by difference in atmospheric pressure, blew one of the brother’s hats off.The Lakota tribe of Native Americans visited the cave long before the brothers and considers it sacred.

Stop in maybe five rooms for talks from the Ranger. Caves are special for their cave formation called the boxwork (looks like honeycomb). Ranger Lauren did a great job of explaining the cave, she had very animated stories and she even through in some humor. Pack a hoodie - it is around 55 degrees in the cave.

Wind Cave National Park,"The accessible tour, our guide of 1 month took us on, was disappointing & unfulfilled. It was 1 room that we walked to 2 sections of (I use a cane) & she had us leave. I asked if I could do more because I can do stairs, etc. She did take us to another part which I walked up & down stairs until she had us leave. It was more satisfying exploring more of the cave which I could do just at a slower rate than a normal tour would go. That's really great that she worked with me to further explore. It made the trip seem worth it. She was in a rush though. My husband commented on how she left us as soon as the elevator doors opened to get back on our own. I called 2 weeks ahead of time & the day before to make sure we weren't putting them in a bind. We went at a time & day they were more than fully staffed the gentleman said. It took us a little less than 1 hour. I only had to take 1 break on the walk down to the cave.

Take seriously the announcement that it's OK if you decide you can't do a long walk (mostly) down stairs in some narrow passages. Once you get about 1/4 mile along the way, you can't go back. Better not to try it if you get claustrophobic. Park Ranger who gave the tour was very informed and passionately in love with the cave. There were more smaller kids on the walk than we expected, and most did OK (other than when Ranger intentionally turned out the lights to show how dark it gets). Even thought they'd had a record day, showing up about 4:15 was pretty good and the two of us got into one of the final tours of the day.

You may need to spend some time while awaiting your tour - don't miss the small bison herd and the prairie dog towns!","August 6, 2016",Boxwork Galore!,40,"Salt Lake City, Utah",4
Wind Cave National Park,"Wind Cave National Park is primarily focused on, no surprise here, the cave. That being said, the surrounding site is National Park space and free, with a number of trails and interesting wildlife viewing. The cave, however, is clearly the highlight.There are numerous cave tours available: 3 different routes that are first-come-first-serve throughout the day, each with multiple tours per day. 2 more challenging tours (Candle-light and Wild Cave) require reservations, and Wild Cave is by far the most intense, requiring commando crawls. The 3 main routes don't require reservations, but the earlier you arrive in the day, the better a chance you have of them not selling out; we had just about an hour wait for our tour having arrived around 11am.All routes involve some number of stairs, but the descriptions of the tours are clear with regards to how many stairs you have to do. We did the Fairgrounds tour, a total of about 450 stairs, but never very many consecutively, so it's hardly strenuous by hiking standards. A layer is helpful, as the cave is always in the low 50's.As for the cave itself... it's very different than other caves I'd seen. It lacks stalagmites and stalactites and has few mineral deposits. Conversely, ""box work"" is a spectacular and rather rare phenomenon where the outlines of filled-in crevices are now exposed as an incredible lattice lining many areas of the cave. The different features at different depths are fascinating. It's quite unlike anything I had seen before and very interesting to explore.As mentioned, it's not strenuous. Tours walk slowly and even the 450 steps are not difficult. It's not particularly claustrophobic (except on the Wild Cave, commando-crawl tour) as far as space, but you can't just break off and readily get out (the tours do weave through tunnels so retracing without a guide would be very hard), so once you're down, expect to finish your tour -- a point also worth considering with small children who may not tolerate an hour or more of just walking or standing in a cave. Tall individuals will have to bend over; 5'2 is the ceiling in many spots.This is well worth a visit and is a unique cave experience.","August 4, 2016",Fascinating and very different kind of cave,16,"Durham, NC",5
Wind Cave National Park,This national park was a wonderful surprise for us. Get there early in the day for you best chance to hike underground with a park ranger. Tours fill fast. We arrived around 11am and were able to get tickets for a 1:40 tour. There are 4 tours to choose from. We did the Fairground tour which was 2 hrs 15 min underground touring two levels of the caves. The caves are dry and have rock formations that are unique. Everything about this tour made it our number one experience in the Keystone area. Loved it!,"August 4, 2016",One of a Kind Underground Hike,18,"East Aurora, New York",5
Wind Cave National Park,"Although Wind Cave is the third largest cave system in the country, and a magnificent to boot, not too many people have heard of this national park. It is well worth a visit. On surface, it is an area where forest meets prairies, leading to interesting views and a variety of wildlife, especially bisons and deers. Underground, it is a uniquely beautiful cave system (I have been to many cave systems and so have a perspective). On the longest tour, of three types they offer, you go through multiple layer of caves...lower, middle and upper. In the middle and lower layers, you would see ""boxwork"" a beautiful and delicate calcite formation. The passage is well lit and our guide, a young summer intern, was really knowledgable. Don't miss it.","August 3, 2016",A hidden gem of the national park system,24,"Los Angeles, California",5
Wind Cave National Park,"We did the cave tour with our family of four and loved it! This is a very unique cave, with lots of narrow passageways and fascinating boxwork formations. Our guide through the cave was interesting, and you could tell that she is very passionate about it, which we loved. It was very crowded earlier in the day when we came in to get our tickets, but by the last tour of the day (the one we decided to book), there were almost no crowds. As an added bonus, our son is a 4th grader and has the National Park 4th Grader Pass and we got to tour the cave for free, so if you have a 4th grader, get your pass before you go!","August 3, 2016",Very cool cave!,88,"San Antonio, Texas",4
Wind Cave National Park,"My wife and I did a national park tour of WY and SD this month, and while down seeing Crazy Horse and the Mammoth excavations, we did a tour of Wind Cave. It's hard to believe that there are over 140 miles of caverns here, but our guided tour of 1.3 miles was almost an hour long, and gave us a great sampling of what this cave is known for. Kara (sp?) our ranger guide, was great with our group of 20ish people. The cave tour goes down a few hundred feet in elevation and there are very narrow sections, as well as larger more open caverns. The famous ""boxwork"" latticing is the main draw, as 95% of the world's boxwork is located within Wind Cave.There are a few longer tours available, but we did the main one. I wore hiking boots, my wife wore hiking sandals, and the tour was mostly on paved walkway. Definitely bring a light jacket or sweater though, it dips below 60F inside!","August 3, 2016","Very cool cave tours, especially all the ""box work"" lattices that it's famous for having",256,"Chicago, Illinois",4
Wind Cave National Park,"Our family arrived at 9:45 am. No problem getting tickets for the 10:40 am tour. We watched the 15-min orientation video before touring. Its a helpful overview of the park and history of the cave. Don't miss it. We did the 1.5 hour Natural Entrance Tour. Our guide was fun, friendly and knowledgeable. He looked like a trim Santa. :). The tour ends in an elevator ride up to the surface. Sadly, the park rangers actually sold tickets to this tour to a family with three kids who all appeared to be under 6 years old. The young parents struggled the entire time managing them. One child was a toddler who had to be held the entire tour. Half way down the cave this child starting screaming and wailing and continued throughout the tour. So WE were ALL trapped underground with a crying toddler. It was horrible. The tour guide kept his cool but it was hard even for him. Soooo .... Tourist beware ... if you see a toddler on your tour return to the ticket booth and book another time. Instead of leaving the tour thinking ""That was great!"" my family were all ""Let's get the hell outta here!!""Park Service: It's time to say NO to toddlers for touring!! Suggest that one parent stay behind with the younger child while the other may go with the older ones. My husband and I ""swapped"" touring privileges with our younger kids for many years. It's best for everyone especially that little child being dragged everywhere crying. ","August 2, 2016",Awesome Cave - Ruined by crying toddler,17,"Dallas, Texas",2
Wind Cave National Park,"To be honest, I hadn't investigated this treasure before taking our vacation but decided to go based on the suggestion of a couple at the B&B we were staying at. On route, I read great reviews in Trip Advisor. Daily, the park offers three different tours through the cave and each have a limited number. We arrived at 1100 and purchased for a 2:20 tour so had time to kill. In other words, get there early for tickets if you don't want a delay. The caves are amazing and was a highlight of our vacation to the Black Hills. Forewarning - lots of stairs. Our tour guide, Jessa, was very knowledgeable and personable. Take a light jacket as the caves stay at 53 degrees throughout the year. ","August 2, 2016",Amazing!,9,"Granbury, Texas",5
Wind Cave National Park,We had 3 teenager's with us and they really enjoyed the wildlife as well as the cave tour. We took the longest cave tour that was 1.5 hours and over 400 stairs.

Wind Cave National Park,"Really wanted to see a cave while in the Black Hills. As this one was relatively close to the Wildlife Loop Road we decided to visit after doing the Loop Road early, nice drive between the two with a few buffalo on the way.We went on a Monday and got there around 0930 and having read some reviews was expecting some long queues, but there wasn't, only a few people in front of us. We went on the 10am tour and even when coming out and back to the entrance at 1130ish still no long queue, so I guess Monday is a good day to go?The tour group was large, about 35-40 people, too large really. The caves didn't really impress me that much and I have certainly seen better, even the famous boxwork is nice to see but didn't really do that much for me. We did the natural entrance tour, my 81 year old mother was a little concerned about the steps but managed fine.Nice picnic area with restrooms and tables just after you exit on the right.","July 30, 2016",Left me somewhat uninspired,167,"Bicknacre, United Kingdom",3
Wind Cave National Park,"We took the natural entrance tour of the cave. It was great because it had many stairs but they were mostly going down and then an elevator up. The rangers at the station were very helpful in picking a tour.You must drive around the area, especially if you have kids. Toward the north entrance, we actually got in a bison traffic jam. My young companion loved that, as well as seeing prairie dogs.I should have allowed more time to stay in this area.","July 28, 2016",The Cave Was Great and The Surrounding Park was Wonderful,86,"Port Huron, Michigan",5
Wind Cave National Park,"Impressive scenery and wildlife viewing opportunities (esp. bison, antelope & prairie dogs). We were a little disappointed with the two cave tours (Natural Entrance & Candelight), perhaps because expectations has been set too high. The caves have an interesting formation called boxwork that is rare outside these caves; however, you don't really see that many other interesting/dramatic formations other than boxwork. If you only have time to tour one area cave, I'd rec. Jewel Cave instead. Driving around (and hiking a couple trails) above ground are well worthwhile!","July 27, 2016",Go for the scenery above ground,79,"Smyrna, GA",5
Wind Cave National Park,"This is an amazing National Park! One of the highlights of our Black Hills touring. We booked the Candlelight Tour a month in advance of our visit, largely because I did not want to risk tours filling up or needing to get there very early in the day to book a tour, and the Candlelight Tour is one of the few that can be booked in advance. My two children (ages 10 and 12) and myself thoroughly enjoyed the 2 hour experience. The tour is capped at 10 people, and it was fantastic having a small group. The ranger was wonderful - interesting, informative, engaging with all of us (the group had 6 children under the age of 13 and 4 adults and we were all enthralled). The tour itself is just challenging enough (tight spaces, steep inclines, low ceilings) to be interesting but not overwhelming, and the candles provided a lovely way of seeing the caves as it would have been when they were first explored. The ranger provided lots of history and moments to stop and look, experience, feel. Highly recommended!","July 27, 2016",Candlelight Tour!,37,philadelphia,5
Wind Cave National Park,"It's a great stopover on a road trip through South Dakota. There are multiple types of guides tours you can do of the cave, that go different distances.

Wind Cave National Park,"Maybe its just that the last few books I read have had caves in them, but those box formations creeped me out. Plus there is a section of the cave that reminded me of a scene from one of the poltergeist museums. We did the Fairgrounds Tour. It was the right size group and the right length of tour. The number of steps sounds scary, but they are spread out. We had not truly planned to go, but I am so glad we did. Above ground, we also saw a herd of bison and many prairie dogs.","July 25, 2016",Wow that was creepy,27,"Sunnyvale, California",5
Wind Cave National Park,"Unfortunately, our travel plans did not allow us to take a cave tour, but we thoroughly enjoyed driving through the park and seeing the wildlife.

We admired the beautiful scenery and the quiet peacefulness of the area.","July 25, 2016","Beautiful scenic drive, even without the cave",97,"Trophy Club, Texas",4
Wind Cave National Park,"We read online that the tickets are first-come basis. We drove thousands of miles to see these caves and may not be able to take the tour? We heard stories of multiple people this happened to. So we got our 5 and 7 year olds up at 6am after a late night at Mt. Rushmore the night before to stand in line at the ticket office. We asked one of the rangers why they didn't sell tickets in advance so people could plan their vacations. She responded that people ended up standing in lines for left over or returned tickets. Ummmm... how is that different??? Now EVERYONE now stands in lines??? They should sell at least 80% of the tickets in advance. Rant done. The caves themselves are wonderful and we all enjoyed our tours despite driving for almost 2 hours between Jewel Cave and Wind Cave to get tickets for each. The Ranger in Wind Cave was pretty rude to our 5 year old who had questions about the Cave. He had legit questions about the cave and she told him to be quiet. He raised his hand to ask questions after she said 'are there any questions', no one else had questions, and she still wouldn't answer his questions. Thanks Ranger Kelly, you're a gem.","July 25, 2016",Ticket process is crazy,55,"Portland, Oregon",3
Wind Cave National Park,This was amazing. We did the Natural Cave tour and loved it. It took about 1.5 hours and was fairly easy to maneuver.

You do not need reservations for this tour. Would absolutely do it again.,"July 24, 2016",LOVED the cave tour,31,"Overland Park, Kansas",5
Wind Cave National Park,"I enjoyed seeing the boxwork formations in this cave, it was something different from other caves I have been in but was pretty much the only feature in the cave.The tour itself was slow and frustrating with a group size of around 40 which meant a slow shuffling pace between the few stops we had along the way. It made hearing the information and seeing much difficult.While in the park I also did the Cold Brook Canyon trail which was a nice short hike that included a Prairie Dog town which was enjoyable.","July 23, 2016","Interesting cave, slow tour",57,"Wollongong, Australia",3
Wind Cave National Park,"About 1 hour's drive from Rapid City, we visited the Windcave National Park and the caves. It was a good opportunity to escape the hot temperatures on the surface by exploring the cave with a ranger tour. Ideally you come early in the morning as the tours (and queues) get increasingly busy. There is a tour for everybody from relatively short 1h tours to a 4h cave crawling tours. Plenty of explanations from a very competent ranger at the outside but a relatively swift tour on the inside with few explanations as there were about 40 people on the tour and there are few places in the cave when the entire group can be together and listen to explanations.","July 23, 2016",Cool activity on a hot day,57,"Lausanne, Switzerland",4

Be sure to wear shoes that have some sort of tread on them the rocks can be slippery from the natural water sources. You will want a light-weight coat, because the deeper you go into the cave the cooler it gets.

If walking or steps are challenging for you, consider one of the less strenuous tours. Get there early, if you don't want a long wait for a tour departure.

Wind Cave National Park,"Not for the claustrophobic and amazing in nature. The honeycombed boxwork formations were amazing. I have been to many caves like Carlsbad in NM, but this was unique and truly superb. Unlike Carlsbad, the web of narrow tunnels is dizzying and the formations within are almost only found in this cave. These caves have huge significance to the Lakota tribes, so for culture buffs there is a lot to experience. The park is massive outside the cave so take your time around to see some of the wildlife and scenery. ","July 15, 2016","Awesome cave, kids loved it ",48,,5
Wind Cave National Park,"Many (many many many many) years ago I came here with my parents and siblings on one of our family vacations. This summer I took my family on a similar summer vacation and made sure to stop here, as it was one of the coolest things I remembered from my childhood vacation.We did the Natural Entrance Cave Tour, and this review will focus on that.The Visitor Center, where you go to start and where you buy your tour tickets, is a nice building that has a lot of information about the cave, on two levels, as well as a gift shop and restrooms. Once you get your tickets, about 5 or 10 minutes before your tour starts, you head downstairs, out a set of doors, and down a path to a covered outdoor waiting area from which the tour departs.After a short trip outside to see the original entrance and learn some history about how the cave was discovered and initially explored, you enter through a set of double doors and go down a long stairway into the cave itself. The tour inside the cave lasts about an hour, and you get to see boxwork and many other interesting and very cool cave features. Our kids, 8, 5, and 2, were very impressed with it all, and each of them kept telling me to take pictures of various formations. The path inside the cave is paved and fairly easy to navigate. There are a few low spots and narrow spots, but the guides is good about letting you know that. The formations inside the cave are beautiful and we were all amazed by them. To put that in perspective a bit, I'm claustrophobic (to the point where I need medication at times) and I didn't have my medicine with me. While I started to get anxious a bit on the stairs going down, once we got to the bottom of the stairs, I was sufficiently distracted by the beauty of the formations, as well as the spaciousness of several of the areas, that I was able to calm down and enjoy the cave. It was that interesting/fascinating to me!Ticket prices are a reasonable, at $12 for adults (17 and up), and $6 for kids 6 to 16 and Senior Citizens.

The tour was a blast! Our group was led by Ranger Jerry, who was knowledgeable and enthusiastic about exploring the cave. Most of the passages in Wind Cave were narrow with low ceilings. We got to see box work formations throughout the tour, and also got to see the natural entrance to the cave. The tour included about 300 stairs, but most of them went down, then we exited the cave using an elevator. In addition to going into the cave, we also saw quite a bit of wildlife in the park, including bison, pronghorn, and prairie dogs.For a trip to wind cave, bring a sweatshirt (it's about 50 degrees in the cave), tennis shoes, and a camera.","July 13, 2016",Natural entrance tour,100,"Detroit, Michigan",5

Due to the weather we only did a cave tour and did not get to hike any trails in the park. we arrived early (before 10 am) and were glad we did as when we finished the tour the line was out the door. We did the fairgrounds tour based on what a ranger stated to us, but really he said you see all the basic same stuff on all tours. He indicated this tour was a lot of walking, but in my opinion it was not difficult at all. The path is well lit and you only half to duck a few times if you are tall. Our tour ranger was entertaining and seemed to enjoy his job. He did a good job of explaining things along the way. The tour itself is a little over an hour which is a decent amount of time to spend in this cave. If in the area, I recommend a stop here.","July 12, 2016",Interesting to see,186,Missouri,4

The cave was fascinating, but there was more to come! We walked the Centennial Trail and had to detour due to bison in our path. We were caught in a hail storm on our hike (ouch) and swamped our way back to the vehicle as we walked through a prairie dog town digging itself out from the storm.. Lastly, we drive through the bison herd in the very north part of the park just before sunset. Very cool way to end a great day.","July 11, 2016","The cave isn't the big attraction, see the wildlife above ground!",1,"Edgerton, Wisconsin",5

Wind Cave National Park,"After having waited in line for tickers at Jewel Cave earlier in the morning my husband and I knew getting tickets at Wind Cave for ourselves and the in-laws may be tricky! What we didn't anticipate was having absolutely no place to park by the visitor center because it was that busy. After circling 3 times by husband dropped me off so I could to try to get in line and get tickets for 6 people. The line was super long for tickets. I asked the ranger what the availability would look like. He said the soonest tour I could get tickets for would be the 1:00 tour. It was 11. Finally got our tickets but then we had to kill 2 hours before our tour. Luckily we'd brought lunch along and they had a nice museum area and gift shop to browse while we waited.We took the Natural Entrance tour. It was very informative and it was neat to see the Boxwork formations since Wind Cave has the most boxwork than any other cave, but my husband and I had seen some earlier at Jewel Cave as well. It was easier to walk the path at Wind Cave but overall we preferred the other, but my in-laws only came on this tour and loved it. Lesson learned from both cave experiences was to arrive early and National Park sites that require tickets because they do go quickly and don't plan too much in day when tickets are required because you may end up waiting awhile and not get to other places because of that!","July 10, 2016",Neat but prefer Jewel Cave,103,"Groton, South Dakota",4
Wind Cave National Park,"We took the wild cave tour and LOVED it. If you're fairly fit, you're not claustrophobic and you don't mind getting very dirty, definitely do it. You spend over 3 hours crawling, climbing and winding through the cave, learning about the different natural formations as well as the history of the site. Groups are small, only 4-10 people. Our ranger (Meredith) was awesome. Reservations are required for this tour so you can't sign up on arrival as with the other tours, but we called around 8am and there were still 2 spots open for the tour that day.

I didn't get to visit the cave, which some other reviews indicate was not that fascinating, but there is an area that runs between Custer State Park and the main strip of Wind Cave. It was so beautiful and peaceful. I didn't even realize that there were two different parks right there until my time there was up, but on my last night I drove through and the bison (or buffalo for the old timers like me that grew up knowing them as only that) were on the move and there were just dozens upon dozens of them. It was just one of the most amazing things I've had a chance to witness. Even if the cave itself is disappointing, the park itself and the others views make up for it. At least in my opinion.","July 7, 2016","Beautiful, Beautiful Park",21,"Lafayette, Indiana",5
Wind Cave National Park,"This tour was billed as 'strenuous' but it wasn't that hard. This is a great tour but I think there are too many people on it to really enjoy it. We spent most of our time standing, waiting for those in front of us, to make their way through the narrow passages. I understand the park service wants as many people as possible to be able to see the cave. Get there early. We arrived at 8am and were able to get on the 9:40 tour.","July 6, 2016",Fairgrounds tour,5,"Annandale, Virginia",4
Wind Cave National Park,"Don't get me wrong, the cave itself was extraordinary and the experience was very memorable, the tour was just bad. First, the guide had trouble answering what seemed to be fairly simple questions like how the water got in and where the wind came from. Then, near the end of the tour, she told us to go left at a fork. However, there were two forks and at the first you were supposed to go right, which we weren't told. Half our group (around 20 out of 39) got lost because of going left. This was not a horrible experience however we ended up in there a half hour longer than we were supposed to be in there. We also weren't even the first group to have people get lost that week and it was only Tuesday, though I cannot say that the other group getting lost was the guide's fault, she simply said they got lost on her tour. This wasn't awful for us but is inconvenient for people on a schedule. So overall, the tour (we chose the 1.5 hour Fairgrounds tour) was great and I highly recommend it, we just got the wrong guide. Also note that you may have to wait for up to an hour to go on your tour, the sights are worth it though, whether you've seen caves before or not.","July 5, 2016",Half group got lost,7,,1
Wind Cave National Park,"Their claim to fame at Wind Cave is ""boxwork"". Let me let you in on a little secret....it's not that interesting! The tour seemed to go on and on, and everything looked the same. If your kids are into minecraft, this may be the tour for them because it felt like we were living the game. The pathways and corridors were very small, which led to a single-file march for most of the tour. We took the natural entrance tour, which starts with a couple hundred step decent into the cave. If you are at all claustrophobic, do not do this tour. All the steps down into the earth, and then the small walkways would not be good for you. At times, you even have to side shuffle through tight spaces to not touch the walls and/or ceiling. There is nothing fascinating here to see, but go ahead and give it a go if you are really into boxwork!","July 5, 2016",Not your typical cave...,0,Minnesota,3
Wind Cave National Park,We enjoyed our tour with ranger Alex. She was very enthusiastic and did not drone in a scripted way as can often be the case during cave tours.

Wind Cave National Park,"We went to wind cave national park after touring Custer State Park as the two are connected. We took one of the cave tours led by a park service ranger. Despite being there on July 4th weekend we only had a 40 minute wait for the tour and watched an interesting movie in the auditorium while we waited.The cave is huge with over 146 miles of tunnels. While not as spectacular as some other caves I have visited with no stalactites or stalagmites, the calcium carbonate formations are very unique to,this cave and interesting.

Wind Cave National Park,"Having visited a wide number of caves in Australia and New Zealand and inevitably having come away impressed with the beauty of the limestone formations I was looking forward to seeing what US had to offer. Wind Cave is one of the world's largest cave systems - I can't remember the name of the tour we took but it lasted some 90 minutes and our guide was Meredith. I left disappointed with the cave and sense that given the general paucity of photography by the visitors that others may have felt likewise. The walk followed what was not dissimilar to a keyhole canyon - narrow with few places to see much. There were no limestone formations (stalagmites, stalactites, shawls etc) although Wind Cave contains 95% of the world's boxwork formations which was of interest. The absence of traditional cave formations results from a layer of sandstone below the limestone which stops water from seeping through. If Wind Cave is the only cave you have visited do not think this is representative of what all caves are like. Should you get 'down under' Waitomo Caves in New Zealand and Australian caves such as Jenolan in New South Wales and the Margaret River Caves in Western Australia provide a much better cave experience.","July 2, 2016",A dry cave that lacks the wow factor,96,"Wellington, New Zealand",3

My kids loved the tour - my daughter wanted to stay and go on the Wild Cave tour where you need to crawl at times! The easy tour was good for our group, ages 11-69. Be aware that the tour includes a few minutes where the ranger turns off the lights and you are in complete darkness. All of the park rangers were extremely knowledgable and personable. After the cave tour, we walked up the hill to the original entrance where you can feel the 20-30 mph wind blowing out from the small opening. It was fascinating!Just a warning, eat before your get to the park or bring your own food. We did not and we ate lunch at the vending machines (hot dogs, turkey sandwiches and Uncrustables PB&J).

Wind Cave National Park,"On a recent visit To the Black Hills, we had the good fortune to visit both Wind and Jewel caves. Each offers a unique cave experience that is worth seeing. Our family of 5 (2 adults, 3 kids 10 and under) did the Natural Entrance Tour. It was about and hour and a half long and was very informative. We arrived at the cave about 10:30 am and only had to wait around an hour before the next tour which was nice. There are some tight spaces on the tour and I did feel a bit claustrophobic at times, but nothing too overwhelming. Total walking distance is about a half mile and there are roughly 150 steps- down only. An elevator takes you back to the top at the end. I felt that the visitor center was wonderful and informative to look at while waiting. There was also a vending area and a nice gift shop. As an unexpected bonus at the register, our two 4th graders had an 'Every Kid in a Park' pass though the National Park Service website and the entire family got in for free.","June 23, 2016",Natural Entrance Tour,13,"Combined Locks, Wisconsin",5

Because we arrived early there was only a few people in line in front of us.The tour has about 400 steps down and is l a concrete walkway.

The tour was labeled as Strenuous due to the many stairs but no one in my family found it difficult. The cool temps inside were a welcome break from the 90 degree weather outside.

The Garden of Eden tour was short and labeled as easy and the Natural Entrance tour was about an hour and a half and was labeled as moderate. Both tours were good, but we had the same tour guide for both so we didn't really get any different information on the second one. If you want to do a tour you should get there early because tickets do sell out. The rest of the park is wonderful and full of wildlife.

Wind Cave National Park,"We were traveling through SD and saw a brochure on this cave and on Jewel Cave. Only had time to do one so picked Wind Cave as they touted a different kind of formation in the cave. This cave has box work and frost formations. It's a ""dry"" cave so the formations are not like any other cave you would visit. Also the OLDEST cave with 145 miles mapped out and still they are mapping the cave.We took the fairgrounds tour which is listed as a 1 1/2 hour tour with 450 steps and is listed as moderate to strenuous. The very beginning of the tour the ranger goes swiftly thru the cave because the tour does not start until you've gotten thru a section. Like all caves there are low ceiling and some tighter passageways but all can be navigated without problems. You just have to watch where you are going. The tour is all and there are a couple of wet steps but nothing dripping. From my own experience of seeing Luray, Mammoth, and Carlsbad this one to me was so so. The park is absolutely beautiful and we saw buffalo, prong horn, deer and prairie dogs. It is an interesting cave so anyone who loves caves should give it a try. There are several tours available and if you have a senior pass you pay half price to go thru the cave. There was a family of 4 in front of us and the cost was $42 for one of the other tours. There is a special tour for kids. I think it's called a Discovery tour and it's a 20 minute tour.No water, food or back packs are allowed in the tour.","June 17, 2016",Interesting adventure,29,"Sandston, Virginia",4

Tour guide was very informative and the views in the cave were very cool. Not really colorful or stalagmites, but other neat formations called boxwork and popcorn and others. They call it a maze cave, as there are so many different paths. It is simply amazing that this expansive cave system exists 200 feet under the rolling hills and wildlife. It's listed as moderately strenuous, with about 400 stairs, but it really wasn't bad (even after foot surgery only 2.5 mos prior). If you're into cave exploring, it's definitely worthwhile.

Wind Cave National Park,"My husband and I did the Wild Cave Tour today and omg what an incredible experience! Neither of us have ever seen or done anything like it before. They are not kidding about the ""wild"" part either- prepare for some SERIOUS physical activity! Climbing through tiny spaces, crawling in to dark holes, up the cave walls and down the cave walls, around sharp and jagged rocks, navigating around drop-offs that seem to have no end...all very thrilling but can be deadly if you slip, (no joke!). So be prepared, excercise caution, and wear old clothes if you decide to go. We were both astonished by how cool this tour was an highly recommend it to adults who feel they are pretty athletic and not claustrophobic. Our guide was Sheena and she was awesome!

We often walked so fast I had to concentrate on my feet and head instead of sites. At one major stop we sat a while and then rotated so everyone got to see the formations. But the lights were turned out before we got to end of row. We were glad we went but won't do other tours.

The narrow path you follow has a mysterious and foreboding air about it. This is an easier trek than Jewel Cave if you have knee problems. There are a lot less steps. Our ranger tour guide was affable, and very knowledgable.We were here in May, and it was not easy to get in on a tour. Luckily, they had four spaces left for a morning tour, just after we got there. In the summer, plan on arriving at 8:00 A.M. the day you want a tour, otherwise, you may be disappointed. No advanced reservations are taken. It's on a first come, first served basis.We took the second, or intermediate tour. It was perfect. I would definitely pick this tour if you have good knees and children over the age of 5. They allow you to bring in baby carriers and there were a lot of crying babies. Better to take the shorter and easier tour if you have toddlers, incapable of walking in there on their own.We saw both caves when we were in South Dakota. I loved each one for different reasons.

The cave is quite dry with no running or pooled water where tours go and only the occasional drip here and there. Bats may be present, but are tiny and only visiting due to the lack of food and water and the abundance of tours. If you go, try to stay close to the rangers as they will point things out that not everyone will get to see. NOT recommended for the elderly or individuals with foot/knee/hip problems. The stairs are almost all downhill with railings, but there are about 300 of them and you start to feel it about half way. Our grandma's knees went out about 3/4 of the way down. Enter the Rangers. With the help of the Park Rangers and some good samaritans (who all got hugs and kisses) she made it to a flat area. One ranger brought a stool for her to rest on and waited with us until she was ready and walked with us to ensure everyone made it out safely.Wildlife is abundant on the surface.

There are a lot of stairs, 350 I think, most going down. There are of uneven heights, and the hand rails were wet and slippery. For me, it was treacherous. At times the trail (no stairs) was steep with no handrails and they tell you not to touch the walls so some of that was difficult. A few stairs going up. And an elevator to bring you back to the surface. I'm glad I did it, but it was difficult.

The tour guide showed us the original small cave entrance, before taking us through the enlarged entrance and down 300 steps into the cave. The tour guide stopped a few times to share information and answer questions. She demonstrated how Alvin McDonald, one of the first explorers to map the cave, used a candle and a rope as his tools in the late 1800s. Much of the scenery in this part of the cave were similar, with lots of boxwork formations to see. There were a few wet spots, but this tour path was mostly dry. We returned back to the surface via an elevator. The tour itself took about 75 minutes. In addition, there were displays, a short film, a gift shop, and the rangers were happy to answer questions.
