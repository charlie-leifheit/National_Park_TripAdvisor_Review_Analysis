North Cascades National Park,".The scenery here was amazing, forests, mountains and lakes, Lake Diablo was incredible, the blue water was fantastic. Definately worth visiting this National Park. We visited America for a month, so we bought the Annual Park Pass, at $80, it saves a lot of money, you can access as many parks as you wish, and only pay the once.","October 18, 2019",Amazing Scenery,60,"Chelmsford, United Kingdom",5
North Cascades National Park,Beautiful!!! Amazing scenery. Some of the rangers at the Visitor Center were not very friendly or helpful. Kids did the Junior Ranger books. It was foggy at the top but we were able to see some of the glaciers and lots of amazing waterfalls.,"October 10, 2019",Amazing waterfalls,130,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",4
North Cascades National Park,This may be one of the most underrated national parks in the system. It's simply beautiful. We entered from the east and unfortunately the visitors center is on the western end of park. Unfortunately we probably missed allot. You can appreciate this park by simply driving through it and appreciating its beauty.,"October 8, 2019",Underrated National Park,21,"Midlothian, Virginia",5
North Cascades National Park,"This park is over 90% wilderness. We were there the last day of Sept on a very cold Monday. Very few visitors so everyplace was quiet and peaceful. Just the way it should be! We saw the major spots: Gorge, Diablo, ross lake, rainy lake, Washington Pass. All were magnificent!","October 1, 2019",Wilderness all around,211,"Ocala, Florida",5
North Cascades National Park,"It's the same drive to North Cascades as it is to Rainier - but this park gets a fraction of the visitors. Some might say, that's good, but it deserves more visitation and publicity. It's closed during the winter (snows), but is well maintained. Great hiking park - back into the backcountry.","September 29, 2019","A great, but under visited, National Park",543,"Denham Springs, Louisiana",5
North Cascades National Park,Yes it’s a quick journey through unless you decide to go camping or hiking but it’s still worth a day or two. I managed to do all the way through to Chelan from Seattle in a day and if just stopping at overlooks then you can do that.,"September 23, 2019",Not the best but still good,66,"Fleet, United Kingdom",4
North Cascades National Park,Although it was a rainy day the views were still stunning. The color of the rivers and lakes is gorgeous. I don’t love that most of the actual NP is hard to access with a really long hike. Most of what accessible is actually a national recreation area. This was definitely worth the drive. ,"September 17, 2019",Wow!!!,82,"Carbondale, Illinois",5
North Cascades National Park,Driving the Washington Hwy 20 is seeing the park. There is a visitors center but there is no vharge to drive through this marvelous area. Don't miss this if in upstate Washington. ,"September 9, 2019",Washington hwy 20 is the Park,62,"Dahlonega, Georgia",5
North Cascades National Park,If you come up here do the drive through this amazing scenery. The glacier blue lakes and pure clean air is refreshing.,"September 3, 2019",Beautiful ,209,"Williamsburg, Virginia",5
North Cascades National Park,Excellent Hike here in the Park. Spectacular Views and scenery. Can’t wait to visit again. Trekked through the snow all the way to the top and made the complete trail loop.,"August 8, 2019",Day of Hiking,10,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5
North Cascades National Park,"Always educational and inspiring in a subtle way! The Rangers and workers are very friendly and helpful in pointing out subtle things that you would otherwise overlook. They are very helpful in assisting you in selecting hiking trails and what to watch out for and what to be careful of! They often have short, educational movies of the area and the wildlife as well as the area's and wildlife's history.","August 7, 2019",Very informative!,52,"Elberta, Alabama",5
North Cascades National Park,We drove here for the day and could have come back for many days more. Even just the drive to the park were incredible. We first drove to the visitors center had lunch on one of their picnic tables and watched the videos about the park. Which are so informative and give us so much information as a family. We then drove to a hiking spot to go for a hike. There are so many we picked one that was good for our family with young children. Again the drive was beautiful and there were lots of places to stop and take in all the views. If you are near Seattle and want to travel North to go hiking I would highly recommend looking into this park. There is so much to do and see and it was worth every second of the drive.,"August 5, 2019",Absolutely Amazing!,48,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5
North Cascades National Park,"Cross the bridge at Marblemount, WA on Stateroute 20 and follow the road to The Mount Baker National Forest. Just after the crossing th next bridge turn right into the Marble Creek Campground. A wonderful quiet place with tall trees, campsites that are Open and Reserved. There is an access to the Cascade River that will be very nice on a sunney day. The first space on the left is the Camp Host site with information and Firewood for sale if needed. These spaces go very fast and it's best to get a reservation in advance but there are a few sites open to use on a first come bases.If full, follow the main road to the next site and look there. You will find a lot of places to explore, fishing, camping, hiking and the GREAT OUTDOORS.","July 19, 2019",Family Camping trip,7,,5
North Cascades National Park,"As one of the least visited parks, North Cascades is absolutely stunning. It’s free to enter, isn’t crowded, and has incredible sites. The color of the water and the mountains is amazing. We spend a day there and loved our time there. There’s also some interesting history in the park with the Seattle Light Company. ","June 19, 2019",More people need to see this park! ,52,"Appomattox, Virginia",5
North Cascades National Park,"We drove the North Cascades loop counterclockwise to save the best for last and we were glad we did! From Washington Pass Overlook to the Gorge Creek Falls, we saw panoramic mountains, 17 waterfalls mostly from our car, and the brilliantly teal colored Diablo Lake. I have difficulty walking and needed to make choices based on access to vista points. My top recommendations: Washington Pass Overlook to see the mountain peaks, high, twisting waterfall between mp 136 and 137, and Diablo Lake. All are handicap accessible. There are restrooms at most stops but they are antiquated and you need to bring your own supplies. Lots of scenic places to have a picnic.","June 16, 2019",Spectacular Gushing Waterfalls,4,,5
North Cascades National Park,"So beautiful, especially in May with so much snow still on the mountains. Approached from the East and the views were amazing. We have been to 21 of the NPs now and this was one of my favorites.","May 13, 2019",Loved this National Park,56,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5
North Cascades National Park,"We love National Parks, particularly when each one features something different. When we saw all the water coming off the steep cliffs, we figure out why it is called the Cascades. The two good things to do from our point of view was the scenery from a stop at the Diablo Lake overlook, and the nature walk on the boardwalk. But despite its beauty, this didn't live up to the interest in most other National Parks.There is no charge.","May 6, 2019",National Park,45,Warrenville,4
North Cascades National Park,"The park has a lot to offer. Great scenery, nice trails. It's not so easy to access and therefor not to crowded, although at some viewpoints (but then you're in Lake Ross NRA) it can be a bit congested. Very friendly staff in the visitor center.","January 27, 2019",One of my favourite National Parks,99,Belgium,5
North Cascades National Park,"Was going on a trip to Washington (and then WY & SD) and was torn between visiting Olympic or here. I loved North Cascades National Park.During this trip we did the Cascades, Yellowstone, Tetons, Wind Cave, & Badlands. Overall, Cascades may have been my favorite.First of all, it's FREE.There is a small visitor center with multiple short films to watch. The center was not crowded at all which was really nice (that is one problem at Yellowstone).The drive along the Cascade Highway is gorgeous. We did some stops like Washington Pass, Gorge Creek, Happy Creek Trail, Diablo Lake, etc. ALL were worth the time.We really wanted to do Cascade Pass or Maple Pass, but in mid-June they were both closed. I did not have high expectations for this park, but now seeing it I know I need to go back sometime when those mentioned trails are not snowed over.1 full day should be enough for a visit if you a driving and doing the short stops. 1 1/2- 2 would probably be good if you are doing one of those longer hikes as well. The drove is DEFINITELY worth it and only a couple of hours from Seattle.","August 18, 2018",Beautiful National Park!,158,"Honolulu, Hawaii",5
North Cascades National Park,"It is worth the drive from Seattle to visit this NP. The info center is more like a museum of the area as well as a great book and gift store. The rangers have programs set up for kids that are pertinent to learning about the fauna, trees, and animal life of the area.","July 29, 2018",Beautiful area...fantastic hikes and deep blue icy lakes.,8,Round Rock,4
North Cascades National Park,This is definitely worth a visit. My husband is determined to visit every National Park but there are definitely some that I would go back to. This is one of those. The bluest waters and the landscape changes all around you. So many great hikes we couldn’t decide on which ones but each that we went on was better than the last.,"July 24, 2018",Blur waters,25,Colorado,5
North Cascades National Park,On our annual cross country motorcycle trip we had the chance to visit this park. The views are beautiful. It’s a no charge National Park and there is no gate. The highway actually splits the park. Bring your cane and travel safe...,"July 8, 2018",Beautiful National Park,150,"Spearfish, South Dakota",5
North Cascades National Park,"The North Cascades National Park is one of the least visited since its location running up to the Canadian Border.The views are immense and the scenery outstanding.There main highway 20 goes west / east across the park, but the majority of the park has no access roads but miles of trails which is also great for hiking and camping.Easy to get to from Seattle , but the main road is normally closed from November to April due to snow and even to June in certain years.Lots of wildlife to see if you are lucky, and watch out for bears!","July 8, 2018",Superb views and beautiful scenery,99,"Rochdale, United Kingdom",5
North Cascades National Park,What a beautiful park. Lots of hikes possible of course. A pity you don't know up front if you can enter it as early as april or may,"June 5, 2018",Gorgeous,583,"Brussels, Belgium",5
North Cascades National Park,"I will say if you are looking to get away from the crowds that descend upon Mt. Rainier National Park, then this place is the perfect escape! It has towering and majestic mountains the surround the road as you drive in and one of the first things you will notice are the green waters of Diablo Lake. It truly is a site to behold and even better to look down upon those waters from the lookout. There are waterfalls throughout the park and quite few pouring down right next to the road. The North Cascades highway that runs through the park is really worth the drive as there is amazing scenery along the way. You will see towering, snow capped mountains along with hills covered in large pines. The park is also filled with quite a few trails although even this late in the year there were some that were still completely covered in snow. Either way, this park is amazing and one you really need to spend some time in as I don't think you will regret it.","May 30, 2018",Simply majestic!,272,"Queen Creek, Arizona",5
North Cascades National Park,"North Cascades NP is an amazing national park with mountainous beauty in it's full glory. This is not heavily visited and is often not included in top 10 or 15 national park list. That's an advantage if you hate crowds like me. The North cascade highway is the only road going through the park which means you have to venture out in the numerous hike trails to witness mother nature's work. Even if you are not a hiker the drive itself is scenic and has multiple lookout points on the highway eg: Diablo lake overlook, Washington pass overlook. I stayed in Marblemount during my visit.","February 11, 2018",Breathtaking and less visited national park,30,"Scottsdale, Arizona",5
North Cascades National Park,"We drove from West to East on the North Cascades highway stopping off at lots of overlooks and passes.We were able to do a few small trails, but since we had our dog with us we didn't plan to hike any of the longer trails in the park, we hope to go back for a lot more adventure.There is so much beauty in this park.Like all National parks it's extremely impressive and has some of the most beautiful scenery and landscapes you can imagine.They call it the Alps of America.It's full of dramatic mountains, beautiful trees, lake, waterfalls, rivers and wildlife.So happy we now live in WA and were able to check this off the Bucket list! We will be back.We also pulled over to the side of the road, because I thought the sun on the mountain looked pretty. When we glanced into the forest beside us it was scattered all over the place with trash, so sad.We don't understand why people feel the need to litter, or why people just careless about trashing this beautiful earth we live on.My husband and I have pledged to always pick up any trash we see on trails and pull offs in any parks we visit.We carry trash bags and gloves at all times.Our national parks are the most important part of this country to us, we have to respect and protect our beautiful wild natural lands.","October 7, 2017","A Breathtaking National park, full of glorious landscapes!",417,"Camas, Washington",5
North Cascades National Park,"I'm so glad we decided to add this to our Pacific Northwest trip. I debated for a long time due to our route, but I'm so glad we went for it. It was definitely worth the time and I would highly recommend. Diablo Lake itself is worth the trip. If you have the opportunity to go please do so. You won't regret it. Washington is a beautiful state!","October 4, 2017",Surprise Gem,17,"Kimball, Tennessee",5
North Cascades National Park,If you have the time to drive along hwy 20 which is the cascade hwy do it. It is beautiful. Plenty of places to stop along the way. We went as far as Mt. Washington overlook. Spectacular views. Wish we could have done the whole loop be didn't have the time. ,"September 28, 2017",Beautiful,51,"Cottage Grove, Minnesota",5
North Cascades National Park,"We did a nature hike near the Visitor's Center that took you near the river--it's a beautiful, easy walk (even I could do it). The trees are coated with moss that makes it look like a fairy tale forest. Then we drove the highway through the park. Diablo Lake is stunning. The water was the most beautiful color. Spectacular scenery--worth a trip!","September 6, 2017",The bluest water I've ever seen,57,"Summit, New Jersey",4

North Cascades National Park,"Park with tons of snow-capped peaks. There's lots of great, challenging hikes. This park has a wild, rustic feeling to it, but there's lots of great developed campgrounds & programs. Be sure to visit Newhalem & do their History tour, very interesting. Visitor center is a cool building with lots of info & exhibits. This park is like the Tetons & Rocky Mountain National Parks rolled into one park! Stunning!","August 17, 2017",Beautiful Park,79,"Sioux Falls, SD",5

North Cascades National Park,"And they really are! Beautiful high mountains, where hiking is a must, that also offer a wide variety of landscapes and wild life. Most definitely one of the most remarkable national park in the USA. This park is so wide you can spend months inside, and it offers trails for every age, ability, and available time! A real gem at the border with Canada. Loved it!","July 26, 2017",The American Alpes!,8,"Houston, Texas",5
North Cascades National Park,"Beautiful lush rain park with majestic mountains, Lake Diablo and the lushness of a gigantic rain forest. Visitor center is helpful and steered us to the magical trail of the cedars. With clinging moss, giant cedars it was surreal and beautiful. Much to explore in this park-start at the visitor center and they'll provide good guidance to explore this beautiful park in keeping with your abilities. Well worth it.
