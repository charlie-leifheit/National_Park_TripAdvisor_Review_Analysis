Going-to-the-Sun Road,This road is a marvel through GNP!! On our first day there we took the guided red bus tour. Vic our driver made for a great day!! Can't say enough good things. This will not disappoint in the least ,"October 17, 2019",Amazing,1,,5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Glacier Park and this road are among the most memorable life experiences. The views are unique and the wildlife can be plentiful. Be cautious driving this road, and especially of other drivers who are not paying total attention. Otherwise enjoy this trip and drive it with it being the destination and not elsewhere. It is one of a kind.","October 15, 2019",Awesome Experience,1,Fishtail\\\\\\\,5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I would say, start early, it's a very popular trip. So amazing, beautiful breathtaking scenery. Parts of the road are not for the faint hearted, narrow, steep drops and Rocky outcrops on the safe side. The walk to the Lake overhang at Logan was beautiful, it was very busy and the car Park although quite large gets really full quickly, hence the early start.","October 9, 2019","This does not disappoint, its amazing",1,,5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,Just a wonderful ride ! Go to the top for breath taking view and down to the lake for ice cream. Wish I was there right now lol ,"October 8, 2019",awesome,2,"Lethbridge, Canada",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This is probably one of the most beautiful drives in the national park system. However, if you are uneasy about driving a narrow road at high altitudes, you may want to take one of the tours and let somebody else drive. White knuckles all the way, but well worth it.","October 8, 2019",Beautiful Drive,21,"Midlothian, Virginia",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Yes, you have to make sure it’s open before you go, BUT.....even if some of it is closed, it’s so awesome!! Logan’s Pass was closed but we drove all the way up to there and trekked our way down. Same with up to avalanche. Still worth it!!!!","October 7, 2019",Beautiful!!!!,157,,5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"An unforgettable experience made much more enjoyable when you take the option to park and ride.You can take one of the famous, long red taxis or a shuttle bus. When you do this, it doe five good things. It is good for the environment (which you must care about, or why would you be here?). It saves gas, it reduces traffic on the mountain, it makes parking available at the lots for others, and it frees you up to safely take pictures and actually totally view what you are passing.Do not take this road for granted, the entire road is only open for a few months of the year do to snowfall or construction.","October 7, 2019",Park and Ride,222,"New Bloomfield, Pennsylvania",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Parking lots get crowded, so get there early to park.It is a beautiful drive with a lot of stops. Jackson Glacier was one of my favorite overlooks.","October 1, 2019",Start driving early!,33,"New Orleans, Louisiana",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"If you visit Glacier National Park, it's hard NOT to take this drive. That being said, there are steep drop offs and in some places, no guardrails. If you are apprehensive about driving the road yourself, you have other options. You can take a ride in an iconic Red Jammer or hop on the free park shuttle. All of these offer you the opportunity to travel along this engineering feat. There are multiple pull offs and areas to stop, stretch your legs and take in a view. The road does climb quite a ways, so be prepared for changing weather conditions as you drive through Logan Pass. Additionally, the weather on one side of the park can be starkly different than the other side. So be prepared with layers and patience. For up to date road status information and road conditions, check out the park's website.","October 1, 2019",Beautiful Scenic Drive,140,"Gorham, New Hampshire, United States",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"What a beautiful road to see a large portion of the National Park! You pass through beautiful meadows, and up to Logan Pass, which is the highest point along the road. Driving through in the early morning and around dusk will yield the best times to spot wildlife. It will take about 1.5 hours to drive from one end to the other - the speed limit is 45mph, windy roads, and there are some incredible views along the way!","September 29, 2019","A ""Must"" if going to Glacier NP",19,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The best way to see the beautiful mountains on the GTTSR is to take a Red Bus tour.. reserve in advance is a must. Several tours to choose from. Tour guides explain all there is to see.If in Glacier national Park, GTTSR is the thing to do. The West side drive to Logan Pass is more "" exciting'"" with the curves and width of the road...and more crowded. The East side drive is less challenging to Logan Pass.","September 29, 2019",GTTSR a must see,36,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,We have been to this park twice in the last 3 years. Love it but every time we get there the road is closed. Last time they still didn't have the snow removed in July and this year we were 1 day late and they had the road closed due to repairs. From the pictures we have seem from friends that went it is a 5 but maybe next time. Just make sure you check before you go to find out if the road is open.,"September 28, 2019",Blocked for roadwork,160,"Phoenix, Arizona",3
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"If you go to Glacier, this is a MUST do, if the road is open. I drove this road in August on a sunny day. it was quite the driving experience. I personally think Glacier is the best National Park I have ever experienced. I've done quite a few through the years.","September 27, 2019",Experience you will never forget.,0,,5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,We had stayed in Whitefish the previous evening and entered the park at 9am and planned a gentle drive around what is supposed to be a beautiful drive and we had a pre booked 2 pm boat trip on St Mary's lake on the other side of the drive. It was all beautiful with leisurely stops until we came to road closure sign at 11am and a ranger who informed us that Going to the Sun road was still closed due to snow! At no point had the ranger at the entrance told us this nor had there been any lit up signs telling us either. So our leisurely day turned into a nightmare as we had a 3 hour drive to get to St Mary's lake the other way. As we left the park we checked for signs- there were none. We made the boat trip after a mad dash with 5 mins to spare. We stayed in Many Glaciers that night. Realise it can't be helped when snow still blocks the route but being from UK we assumed if nothing was said at entrance then it was open ... never assume!,"September 26, 2019",Beautiful day turned into a nightmare drive,16,"Taunton, United Kingdom",3
Going-to-the-Sun Road, It's a WILD ride that's NOT for the faint of heart... some passageways are so tight between cras I thought we were going to knock each others side mirrors off. But every second was worth it to see these views.  I highly recommend you take this trip in September (like we did) when thr park is less crowded. We were able to pull off at every overlook and spent lots of time taking pictures. If you take this road be sure to go all the way to Many Glacier Hotel. It's worth the trip!   ,"September 26, 2019",The views are breathtaking!!!!,56,"Wichita, Kansas",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Glacier National Park has been on my bucket list for years. My wife and I attended a Lions Forum in Spokane last week and had an extra day for sightseeing, so we chose to Glacier Park. We rented a Suburban in Spokane and drove 5 hours to the park.The drive through the Idaho panhandle and Montana was beautiful with big lakes, rivers, mountains and more. However the park itself was one of the most beautiful places I have ever been.Mountains, waterfalls, rivers and more. We didnt get to see the glaciers because Going to the Sun Road was closed in the middle of the park for maintenance. We knew this before leaving, but decided to go anyway. The trip was still worth it.","September 25, 2019",Beautiful park,32,"Hays, Kansas",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This is one of the most beautiful areas of the United States we have ever seen. Words simply cannot describe how beautiful it is. Before arriving at Glacier, we read a lot of reviews talking about how busy the park is. In our opinion, compared to parks like Yellowstone or the Great Smokies, Glacier isn't at all busy to the same degree. In any event, it did not deter from our experience. We drove the entire length three times during our stay, and mountains seem to change every time depending on the weather. We made ample use of pull offs to take photos, to let hurried drivers pass, and to just sit and take it all in. Even weeks after returning home, we look back on this road as a life-changing experience. This road is the crown jewel of the park and the nation. Enjoy!","September 25, 2019",Words cannot express the beauty,82,,5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Glacier Park in the fog and rain is not worth the very steep price of admission (no day passes!), since the expansive views were obscured and the narrow, winding road carved out of the mountain is scary. (Tho' everyone drove slowly and carefully.) However, we did see occasional misty mountains and valleys, and the lakes were still pretty, so I feel good recommending it for a sunshiny trip. BUT a plus to going in clouds is few crowds. I understand they can be awful, especially since you can only stop at viewpoints. We had the Lake McDonald shoreline to ourselves. We did have one amazing experience: we saw a young Grizzly bear on a ledge overlooking visitors stopped in cars and a shuttle.","September 24, 2019",Must be pretty in the sun!,17,"Manchester, New Hampshire",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Go very early, the road is not that bad compared to other passes I've driven. The hike to Hidden Lake on top at Logan Pass is great, but be early to avoid the crowds","September 23, 2019",Go Early Road,6,Grenada,5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Thirty of us were picked up at Many Glacier Lodge in East GNP and had the thrill of being driven on the entire road and then on to Lake MacDonald Lodge. August 23rd & we had the top back. The first part of the ride was quite cold and windy. Blankets on the seats were great. Loved the stops at the overlooks where we got out. At a one walked a path to a beautiful spot with swift river/falls. Other places we stopped and could stand up/pop up to admire views and take pictures. Our driver was a wealth of knowledge about the park, the touring cars, the construction of the road and days before that in the park! We also stopped at the Logan Pass Visitor Center. In my opinion, the very best way to see the park driving. You are free to look everywhere. I was very happy we just happened to sit behind the driver. Warmer.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,Beautiful drive. Busy with lots of cars even in September but sooo worth it. Many of the trail-heads start off of GTS road.,"September 21, 2019",Going-to-the-Sun-Road,0,,5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This road is one of the most spectacular drives we've ever taken, and we've done a few. There are lots of places where you can pull put and admire the view, and it would be crazy to drive the road without doing this several times. In high season the road can get very busy, so an early start pays dividends. There are spots where you'll feel exposed to big drops, especially when travelling west to east as you'll be on the outside edge for most of the way. Also, you need to be aware that the road does get very narrow in places, especially on some of the bends in the middle section, so take it slow. It would be very easy to scrape your car against another vehicle, the mountain side or the stone walls that guard the drops. There are width restrictions determining which vehicles are allowed on the road. Many of the best hikes in Glacier are accessed from points along the road, especially from Logan Pass and its visitor center.","September 19, 2019",Spectacular Drive,5,"Gaborone, Botswana",4
Going-to-the-Sun Road,Plan on doing this trip well in advance the time of year is crucial to having an amazing experience. I did it in September the week after school started I think I picked the best time. Loved everything about the park.,"September 19, 2019",Wow what a drive.,27,"Toronto, Canada",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Going to the Sun Road has amazing scenery all around. We visited in early September and it was fairly crowded, but we always managed to find parking when needed. A couple times we had to wait for a spot, at Logan's Pass and near Avalanche Lake. There are lots of pull-outs and such wonderfully beautiful scenery. You just run out of adjectives to describe it all. The Lord's creation is stunning. We did several hikes along the road...Avalanche Lake, Hidden Lake, St Mary's and Virginia Falls. They were all so excellent. We were at the Goose Island Overlook at sunset and were amazed once again. We saw wildlife including deer, black bear, big horn sheep and mountain goats. I wish I were back there today taking it all in and enjoying the majestic views. ","September 19, 2019",Outstanding views,59,"Easley, South Carolina",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,One of the best drives in the US. I recommend going from West to East. Be prepared to stop and maybe often. ,"September 19, 2019","Crowded, yes. But still Excellent!",11,Massachusetts,5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"My wife & I love visiting our national parks. GNP is pretty close to the top of our list for favorites. Most beautiful scenery we have ever seen.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,Words cannot adequately express the engineering marvel of this road nor the vistas you will encounter along it. Pictures cannot do justice to what nature has to show you.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Traveled Going to the Sun road in September, it was everything that it was supposed to be. Incredible views throughout much of the road, and a very pleasant trip from one into the other. Saw some mountain goats which was fantastic. Would highly recommend this as a part of any trip inthe area.","September 17, 2019",Incredible,5,"Lincoln, California",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The Going to the Sun Road basically cuts right across the park from the west entrance at West Glacier all the way out to St Mary. I would suggest that you start at the west entrance as it is the prettier of the two entrances and provides a wonderful transition from terrain to terrain and an ever climbing elevation change. It is one of the most scenic roads in the United States, hands down, and provides the traveler with spectacular, breath taking (if not scary) views of mountains, valleys, glaciers and crystal clear lakes. You cross the continental divide close to Logan Pass which is almost 7000 feet in elevation. I did not feel stressed out at all along the long and winding road, even though there were places where the road has no painted center line and the road literally clings to the side of the mountain with sheer drops to one side. It is not for the faint of heart or for people with height issues. If this is a concern you can arrange for one of the shuttle tours. Best to arrange these in advance. It is best to start your visit at one of the visitors centers where there are maps, very informative rangers and good rest rooms. Best to have a full tank of gas before setting out and some food and water. You will encounter wild life. We were very close to elk. There are restrooms along the way, but avail yourself of these when you see them as you will be stopping often for photographs and just to soak in the scenery. You may want to take a light coat along in the summer and wear very sensible hiking boots/shoes. In the summer, Logan Pass parking lot fills very quickly, so if you want to park there and hike, get there very early during the summer months and holidays. There are far too many points of interest to discuss here, so get a map and follow along with it. We went to Denali last year and found this, and Yosemite to be spectacular but this Park provides an incredible variety of scenery, vistas, glaciers, waterfalls, lakes, aqua color rivers, etc. concentrated along a 50 mile road that spans the park. It is something you have to see and experience to believe.","September 17, 2019",This is incredibly beautiful,453,"Bristol, Connecticut",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Schedule a RED BUS TOUR several days/ weeks in advance since attempting to navigate this narrow, winding road with extreme rock out-croppings and vertical drops , not to mention finding a parking space at every pull-out is a challenge.","September 17, 2019",Awe-inspiring,0,,5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"In spite of the wet, soggy day, the trip on the ""Going to the Sun"" Road from Lake MacDonald to Many Glaciers was absolutely beautiful, full of interesting information from the driver, Geno, and having a great bunch of travellers on board with us. Learned a lot about the area, and the history of the road, as well as srring the most beautiful sites. Really a must see. Had considered driving it ourselves, but would have missed all the information, comraderie, and the ability to see everything from all sides, especially after the roof on the bus was opened. Got a little wet, but you can't have everything!","September 16, 2019",Great Adventure with Fun People,2,,5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We were there on 9/8/19 (Saturday after Labor Day) leaving St Mary Visitor Center at 9:30 AM and ending at Apgar Visitor Center. We encountered six stops that were totally full, so we were unable to stop at Logan Pass at 10:50 AM. There was a group of about 10 bicyclists that we kept getting behind and passing. They did split up into groups of 2-3. I appreciate that it's an awesome road for a bicyclist, but the road is barely wide enough for vehicles, not to mention bicyclists trying to go up a very steep grade. We were able to stop and do a short walk along St Mary Lake. Overall I was under impressed. I think the Trail Ridge Rd in Rocky Nat'l Park is just as awesome and with a whole lot less vehicle traffic. I cannot imagine what Going-to-the-Sun Road is like in the summer.....That being said, the scenery was awesome but it certainly isn't the only place in America with switch backs, drop offs, and gorgeous views of mountains and valleys.","September 15, 2019",Skip the crowds and do Trail Ridge Rd in Rocky Nat'l Park,66,"Clive, Iowa",3
Going-to-the-Sun Road,It is almost impossible not to do the Going to the Sun Road at least once during your stay at the National Park. It is so worth it. You will see all the major attractions that are visible via the road and if you do the red bus tour you will also get to experience the knowledge and learn some interesting facts. We ended up doing the road twice to be able to get to all the stops we wanted at different times of day for a great spectrum of views of the park. I would highly recommend giving yourself a full day to do this road. It will be a slow roll going both ways especially because of the amount of people.,"September 15, 2019",The must do thing at Glacier,121,"Nashua, New Hampshire",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,Size restrictions prohibit prohibit vehicle over 10’ high/21 feet long/8’ wide. This means that even regular pick up trucks should tuck their mirrors in. It really is that tight! There are times when you’ll be driving very close to the edge without a guard rail and the windiest/narrowest part of the road has no center line because it’s barely wide enough for two cars to pass. Be prepared to take it slow. There are pull outs in most places except in the portion without the centerline. ,"September 14, 2019",Narrow but spectacular ,183,"Venice, Florida",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"From one side of the park to the other this road gives you nothing but beauty to look at. There are lots of little pull outs where you can stop and marvel and even when it’s busy there seems to be spots where you can get out of the way. The road is not scary. It’s well built and amazingly free of switchbacks and big curves. Even if you never got out of your car this is completely worthwhile to drive. And driving both directions is a good idea, because you are truly looking at different views depending on the direction you’re traveling.","September 13, 2019",Fantastic Scenes,270,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Going to the Sun Rd. in Glacial National Park, Montana is spectacular as well as a little scary to drive as you are up so high with drop off cliffs & minimal guard rails or rock barriers between you and the bottom of the mountains and a few switch backs to deal with as well. However the road itself is excellent but usually a lot of traffic depending when you go. But none of that would stop us from going as to witness such beautiful landscape every corner you turned! We actually stayed at the far end of the park so drove the whole thing.","September 13, 2019",Amazing & spectacular drive.,21,"Ottawa, Canada",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The first night we were there we drove into the park on the Going to the Sun Road as far as Lake McDonald just to take pictures.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We have been to most of our nation’s national parks, and while they each have their own special beauty, I don’t think anything is as beautiful as GNP, and the best way to view it from all sides is the GTTS Road. It is spectacular. The road itself starts on the western side passing Lake McDonald and verdant groves of lodgepole pine and hemlock, opening up to vistas of the Rocky Mountains. There are places to pull off along the way, but finding parking at some of the more popular sites is difficult. Restrooms are placed strategically; most are vault toilets, but there are nicer restrooms at the lodges and visitor centers. The most crowded area is Logan Pass, the site of the continental divide because many people park their cars there to hike the Highline Trail. The eastern side of the park seems less verdant, but beautiful nonetheless. We never came close to hitting another car as we journeyed on this road, but you can’t take your eye off the road for a second! There is no cell service on the road so no one can be distracted by texting. There were areas where rocks had fallen on the road while we were there, and there were a few areas we drove under and held our breath hoping the rocks wouldn’t fall. The road is supposed to close September 15, 2019 which is earlier than it’s usual closure because they plan to make repairs to the road which I would assume also means putting up netting to prevent rock falls.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Going to the Sun Road is a beautiful 50 mile 2 lane road that takes you through Glacier National Park from West Glacier to St. Mary. The history of designing to executing this road took 20 years. Incredible to think of the man power to construct. The east side tunnel was excavated by hand. Amazing. The first time we drove straight through the entire road to St. Mary starting in Apgar it took 2 hours. We purchased the 7 day pass for $35 at the guard entry you pass through when entering the Going to the Sun road. They give you a nice map of the road as well. The second time we drove the entire road it took us 4 hours but we stopped at all the pullouts, Trail of the Cedars & the Forest Gump bridge near St. Mary visitor center. The road offers amazing views of Mountains, Glaciers, Lakes, Waterfalls, trees & greenery. Unfortunately we did not see any wildlife. If entering in West Glacier entrance the 2 lane road is fairly easy until the Loop area to Siyeh bend. The road becomes narrow with tight curves that hug cliff walls or drop offs depending on which way you’re heading. Probably why many people were taking the Red Bus tours instead of driving. Definitely look at the parks website to check road conditions & when the road opens & closes for the season. There is no cell service on the road either so we planned accordingly. Visitor centers at St Mary, Logan’s Pass & Apgar. Gas station just outside the West & St Mary Entrances. Lake McDonald lodge is a wonderful place to enjoy drinks outside with beautiful views of the lake & the food was pretty good as well. ","September 8, 2019",Gorgeous views,465,"Kissimmee, Florida",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"There is no doubt at all that this is one of the great highways of the USA. The views are superb. However, if you don’t like heights I would think twice about doing it. The road is at places very high, with vertiginous drops at the side. It gets busy so is tricky to pass larger cars in places. I must admit my appreciation of the view was marred by my fear. Those of a stronger disposition will no doubt love it.","September 6, 2019",Not for the faint hearted,19,Wales,4
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I drove this rode on my own several times during my stay in the park. I am not a fan of heights but the road is fine- no one is going quickly. while you need to keep your eyes on the road, I did not find it to be a white knuckle experience.

I am sure the commercial tour guides provide great information about what you are seeing but if one does there own research and reads the travel guides you can get much the same tour without the high cost. I say much the same tour only because the commercial tours do make stops that the shuttle does not and the shuttle makes stops the commercial tour does not.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We drove up the road from the west entrance of the park, up to the Continental Divide at Logan Pass. Initially the road travels along Lake McDonald, where the scenery is nice, but not spectacular. There are many pullouts along the way, which we had to skip since we wanted to get to our destination before it got too late. But it seemed like we could have stopped at any of them on the way: they were not over-full, even on this nice Sunday morning. After passing the lake, the road continues for some ways before heading up to the pass. On this section, the road is narrow and winding. You'll want to make sure to be careful here, as the road is barely wide enough for traffic in both directions, with either a steep drop-off on one side, and rock/cliff walls on the other . Also, there were a fair number of bikers on the road, requiring extra caution when passing (if you think it's scary looking over the edge of the road from your car, imagine biking up there, with all those cars passing by!). Bikers are not allowed on the mountainous section from 11AM to 4PM, for that reason. The scenery is just spectacular, but of course if you're driving you won't (or at least shouldn't) be able to enjoy it much. You may want to book a red bus tour to more fully enjoy the road (but you probably need to book well in advance during peak season).","August 25, 2019",Great Views (but not if you're driving!),208,"Somers, New York",5

The information from the driver/Jammer was great. He told us all kinds of facts about the road itself, the park, the Blackfeet People, the historic buildings and the effect of fire in the region. It was nice to sit back and enjoy the ride. Our Jammer took us on a couple of short hikes to see things we never would have found on our own.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,My wife and decided to go it alone with our own vehicle after finding about the hassle and inflexibility with the shuttles and the red tour cars booked. We’re glad we did. At the recommendation of our lodge we left for the park from whitefish at 6 and arrived at the park entry at about 7. Leading the pack and not good on heights it was very intimidating to look up the mountain and see car specks on the side way up. I stayed mainly in the middle of the road and kept in D2 for braking top speed of 15mph. I’m glad I did. It was a white knuckle trip and neither my wife or I looked out the car much if at all but we made it to Logan Pass by 7:45 and the lot was almost full. We took the hiking trail to Hidden Lake. It was more incredible than anyone could imagine and made us realize the entire trip was worth it. We saw goats but no bears. Lots of alpine flowers in bloom especially monkey flower. We toured the visitor center and as we returned to our car had several people asking for our stall. Some had been waiting for half hour. We then went east to the st Mary entry. It was again incredible but more palitible driving. We seen no bears however and apparently it was too warm midday. Best is early morning or evening. We then went to Many Glacier which was nice but nothing as dramatic as road to the sun. We decided to take the west glacier trip home rather than to stress out taking the road to the sun back.

The only wildlife we saw were ducks swimming upstream at one of the lookout points by some rapids. But the scenery more than made up for the lack of animals. Mountains, valleys, glaciers, waterfalls, rock formations, wildflowers, lakes, streams...the US Rockies at their finest. The road curves and bends the entire time so driving slowly is recommended. This is also the best way not to miss anything. Cars all drive at about the same speed & pull over frequently so there is no pressure to go quickly. We also passed through two tunnels cut through an enormous mountain. So many photo ops. There are small rest stops scattered along the route. One huge parking area next to a large building with park information and a separate building with unisex bathrooms. This is the largest parking area/rest stop at GNP. Many marked hiking trails.

If you enjoy nature with a million other people and 1/2 a million cars, this is for you. We arrived at the park at what we thought was when it opened. Turns out they never really close the gate, so you can enter whenever you want and avoid paying the entrance fee. We drove straight to Logan's pass because we knew the lot filled up quick. It was already full. I had to jump out of the car to use the restroom because there wasn't even limited time parking spaces to do that. The Ranger kept letting more and more cars into the lot and everyone kept circling and circling. We decided to drive back down and use a shuttle from Lake McDonald hotel. There was no parking there either. This time we beached the car near an outhouse to take care of business. We finally found a spot but took a shuttle only to Trail of the Cedars.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,Traveling during the summer months makes this road less accessible--or at least the viewpoints. We went during late July and had no idea parking for key points would be such an issue. Later we learned that people line up at 7am or earlier to get ahead of the crowd. Someone told us part of the parking problem is folks who are going on day hikes and hence leave their vehicle parked all day long at key points. We ended up just giving up on trying to compete for a parking spot and drove through with very few stops. You should plan to be there early early. Also the road on the East side to Browning to all torn up and you feel like you are in a third world country. Browning itself is also a bit of a disappointment.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We spent two days in Montana on the road, stopping at many sights and doing a couple of hikes. Although the stops were REALLY crowded, the road and the hikes themselves were not. We downloaded the Gypsy Guide app in advance after reading a few reviews. Definitely worth the $6.99 price and we will look for this guide from now on for future road trips. It was informative, not too much talking, and gave us lots of info to make the trip more enjoyable. Before going, we thought about doing the shuttle or a jammer tour. In retrospect, if you want to hike, the shuttle is a great choice because you won’t have to find parking - which was the biggest headache of all. But, you will still have to find a spot at one of the visitor Centres - which is also difficult. This was the one negative of the whole trip - we didn’t even go to the Apgar Centre one way, or stop at Logan’s Pass on the way back because there was no parking. As well, we ended up not doing one of the hikes because we couldn’t find a parking spot. Except for the parking woes, which as others have said, are not as much of a problem later in the day (by 3:00pm, there was lots of parking at the pullouts we passed), the trip was fantastic. The views are beautiful, there are tons of trails that are easily accessed from the road and are not too difficult. I didn’t have my hiking shoes with me, and was still able to enjoy a waterfall hike and the Logan’s pass hike to the hidden lake overlook no problem. We could not find an affordable place to stay near the park so stayed in kalispell. It was a bit of a drive, but made lots of sense.","August 7, 2019",Excellent Trip!,34,"Calgary, Canada",5

We never had any problem pulling off the road to admire the view, and were able to park at the trailhead we wanted. (Heads up - the Florence Falls hike is much more strenuous and steep than the elevation gain stat suggests - we had to turn back halfway due to 30 degree heat and not having enough water - it was still worth it even if the return ascent nearly did for me.) My husband did the two halves of the road by bike, one morning, one evening, and found it the incredible experience he’d hoped for.

There are size limitations on vehicles so make sure you know what those are. Also, parking at the peak is very very limited and you often have to drive around and wait, sometimes for more than 45 minutes. We were at the peak by 8 a.m. and all spots were taken.

There are beautiful vistas and plenty of pull outs. We drove the road East to West on a weekend in July. We first drove up to Logan's Pass to hike around 7:00pm on a Friday and there were hardly any cars on the road or in the parking lot. It was a great time to go, plus a great time to see wildlife. We drove again Saturday morning, arriving at the St. Mary's entrance around 7:30am and it was getting fairly busy by then. I would suggest taking a later afternoon/evening drive or very early morning. Drive slow, don't be in a hurry, take in the views and take advantage of the pull out areas.","July 29, 2019",A must see/do in Glacier,9,Minnesota,5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,Absolutely phenomenal experience!! Already on my list of places to come back to. We only had one day to drive through and explore and there’s so much more to see and do. For the next trip we will spend some time researching the trails and finding out which ones are suitable for our experience level. There are areas that don’t let you bring your RV if it is over 21 feet in length. There are also some areas that say that you cannot ride your bicycle. Those are things to keep in mind when planning your trip. Also there are places where the road is extremely narrow. We have a super duty and had to pull our mirrors in in order to not hit the rock wall or on coming traffic. Anything bigger than a super duty is not recommended. Of note: if you are terrified of heights I don’t recommend the going to the sun road. It’s basically equivalent to mother nature’s roller coaster. The road going from east to west is better because you were on the inside of the road. The road going from west to east is way scary if you are the passenger in the vehicle. ,"July 29, 2019",Breath taking!!,2,,5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"First of all, I wish some of the people who wrote a terrible review would just stay home. I am sure they are negative in all aspects of life. The beauty can’t be described easily. The history of Glacier and how it came to be is a remarkable story. We were going to drive the scenic route then we discovered the shuttle and found it is the way to go. In prime tourist and vacation season the shuttle works because it is hard to pull over and find a place to park along the way if you drive. The shuttle can drop you off at a stop you like to see the beauty or take a hike, and you can get on one of the shuttles later to another stop or return to the beginning. Driving is probably an option in non peak season. RV driving is never an option. Don’t miss this ","July 23, 2019",What an awesome day,20,"Delaware, Ohio",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,Visited Glacier National Park the last week of June. We have a 22 foot motorhome so we could not drive the road past Avalanche Creek so we took one of the Red Car Tours. This is really the best way to see the road because the driver has to be so focused on navigating they can't stop to look. The views were breathtaking; the driver made several stops so we could take pictures and view the many waterfalls. The driver had lots of stories and history about the park that we would not have gotten on our own. Just so impressive.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"As a part of a long cross-country roadtrip, my friend and I looked forward to Glacier as likely one of our favourite stops, and we were not disappointed. As the elevation rises, you may find your car in the end of a road overlooking a cliff. You are not in danger so don't worry yourself about it - just drive carefully. And you should stop at outlook points as much as you like! This is the drive of a lifetime and there is nowhere else like it in the country. Familiarize yourself with a list of notable points along the road before you go - e.g., the Weeping Wall. Take lots of pictures. We drove in the later afternoon/early evening, and the lighting made an already magical scene absolutely heavenly. Go here for a basically supernatural experience. (I know I sound crazy, but you'll understand when you go!) The drive through from west to east is about 2 hours without stops. The areas to stay outside of the park are quite expensive. If you want a hotel, expect to pay at least $120, and that's on an unimportant weeknight. I recommend booking way in advance to help you look for cheaper prices, and considering staying somewhere (like an Airbnb) several hours away from Glacier to avoid those exorbitant edge-of-park premiums. ...Or!

We wished the shuttle was going once the road opened so we could all be together to make hikes together. I do have a fear of heights, so some of the drop offs on the road where there were no guard rails did scare/caused anxiousness for me a bit.

Lots of places to pull off and make sure you stop at Logan's Pass if you can - but get there early! Lake McDonald or Apgar Village is also a great place to have lunch. Also, if you drive the road from east to west, you don't have to go back the same way especially if it's getting near dark. You can go back Highway 2 that runs at the bottom part of the park (you can pick this up near Apgar Village which is at the end of Going-to-the-Sun road) and it's like a regular highway.","June 18, 2019",Amazing drive!,121,"Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio",5

We lucked out with a handicap spot, but many were forced to just drive over the mountain without stopping or exploring.

Most of the sights are visible from the road but you’ll want to stop and savour them.We didn't see many animal sightings along the road, but one late evening encounter with a rare wolverine crossing right in front of us more than made up for.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Going-to-the-Sun Road traverses the most spectacular part of Glacier National Park. It's an amazing engineering feat, as in spots, it's literally hacked out of the sides of the mountains. It reaches its highest elevation at Logan Pass, a little over 6,000 feet, where you can park and hike higher, if you would like. While some folks would be a bit short of breath at that altitude, most should be fine, as altitude sickness shouldn't be a problem.The road is a bit narrow in spots, and at places there are dropoffs of thousands of feet with a stone wall serving as a guardrail. It demands full attention from the driver, so if you want to enjoy the scenery, pull off from time to time. Your passengers might get skittish if at times, all they can see is air out of the right side window! These things said, as long as the driver is careful, it's not inherently dangerous.Most folks travel the road both ways. Allow at least 4 hours for the round trip.A big ""if"" here is the weather. Because of the altitude and how far north it is, the season at Glacier Park is short. Going-to-the Sun quite often doesn't open until June, and is usually closed by snow by late September. The weather day to day can be iffy also. On both of our visits, rainy weather was around a good part of the time. You can have clouds and fog on one side of the divide and clear skies on the other. Allow at least a three day visit to the park to ensure at least one good day to drive the road.You can also leave the driving to someone else. Antique red tour buses, called ""jammers"" will drive you over the road (for a fee, of course) so you can enjoy the view without worrying about driving. In good weather, the tops roll back foe an even better view.Full disclosure: it's been several years since I have been there, but I'm sure much has not changed. I was there during June, but not in 2018...TA doesn't allow me to put in an older date. I have a friend who lives in Montana from whom I get frequent updates about the park.I'd recommend everyone travel this road at least once.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Is this what Austria and Switzerland look like? When we visited Glacier National Park in early October, the 50-mile Going-to-the-Sun Road that connects the East and West sides through the middle of the park was only open for 21 miles. But that's more than enough to get the view of a lifetime. Going-to-the-Sun Road is a scenic mountain road, the only one that traverses the park crossing the Continental Divide through Logan Pass at an elevation of 6,646 feet, the highest point on the road. Construction began in 1921 and was completed in 1932. The road is the first to have been listed on National Register of Historic Places (1983) and designated as a National Historic Landmark (1997) and also a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark. It usually is open from early June to mid-October before snow makes it inaccessible. It is a two-lane road that is quite narrow and winding with hairpin turns. It usually takes about two hours to navigate the 50-mile distance from one end of the park to the other. But the view...well, pictures or TV travelogues don't do it justice. You have to be here...the lakes, the snow-capped mountains, the forests, the colorful flora and fauna, the waterfalls, the animals. Jackson Glacier Overlook affords the best opportunity to see a glacier from the road. It is located on the East side of the road near St. Mary Lake. When touring Glacier National Park, remember one important thing: There are no gas stations anywhere in the park.

We were late in the season and midweek, so there were almost no crowds or traffic. The trees were in full color and beautiful. Definitely on the list to come back and spend more time.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We drove this road late September and the colors were beautiful. We left from West Glacier at the Apgar Visitor Center, it is roughly 50 miles to East Glacier. There are several small pull outs, places for slow moving vehicles to pull over and a couple places to pull over for photos as well as another visitor center past the middle point called Logan Pass up top. The scenery was incredible, however, the road is very narrow, room for 2 vehicles driving carefully and it is paved, there is also a barrier near the edge. However, if you are afraid of heights, I would not recommend this trip. If you leave from West Glacier you are on the outside edge for most of the trip. If you are not afraid of heights, you will see amazing parts of Glacier NP!","September 30, 2018",Not for people with fear of heights,5,"Lostine, OR",4
Going-to-the-Sun Road,We were extremely fortunate when we visited Glacier National Park. Going to the Sun Road was closed for the wildfires the day we arrived so we had no expectations of actually being able to drive it. It ended up fully opening on the second day so we were able to drive it. We drove it ourselves and were there after labor day so there was very little traffic and we were really able to travel at our own pace. We started early in Apgar and stopped at the visitor center and then began our tour. There really are no words to appropriately describe this drive. Bring your binoculars and good camera for some amazing sights. Take your time to stop along the way and take in the surroundings. We actually ended up driving this a couple of times over several days because we were seeking out as much wildlife as we could. On the last night we were there we ended up driving it in the late evening and into the night. We saw a lot more wildlife around the entrances in the morning and in the evening. There was still a lot of evidence of the fires while we were there but very little activity left. The views and the scenery on this drive are unforgettable. We preferred to drive it ourselves rather than do the tours but either way I would say this is a must see.,"September 30, 2018",Unbelievable Drive,270,"Canton, Connecticut",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,This is an unforgettable drive. We stared in Apgar and ended in St. Mary some two plus hours later stopping at a number of roadside pullout along the way to enjoy the Incredable views. The road is anything but straigh. This is a road that requires your nearly full attention especially in the higher elevations where much of the travel is along cliffs leaving little extra room for two way traffic. We found the Apgar to Logan Pass to be the most challenging section of the drive but also offered the most spectacular views.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"My family visited Glacial National Park at the beginning of August 2018. Among the many sight-seeing spots in the park, this is an exciting long winding drive path where you can enjoy the beauty formed from green woods, glacials and glacial ice/snow-melting-formed waterfalls as well as strange beautiful hills or rocks that have unique structures and shapes. In one place close to the topmost of the road, the beauty of the views is the utmost because you can see a waterfall flying down through the inner side of the drive road while in the sun shining lights, you can see a beautiful half circular rainbow at the bottom corner of the flying waterfall. At the same time, not far from the waterfall, car streams periodically flow through a 10-30 meters long tunnel passing through a protrusion of the hill where the road has to pass in order to go to the top of the big mountain. If you look out or down from the road close to the waterfall, it’s very steep or you may dangerous but the views are very beautiful because of green woods in far lower hillsides or glacials on the remote hilltops.

On our second day, we went to Many Glacier....and that's what saved the trip for me. Beautiful hotel, no forests of dead trees, nice cafe...it will take decades for the forest to return.

From Lake McDonald to Avalanche to the switchback and climbing the steep grade onward and upward to Logan Pass is awe inspiring and physically rewarding. The highway is narrow and the curves are tight so no wide loads or long motor homes (you will be turned around). You can expect to see mountain goats, black bear, moose, and bighorn sheep.

The broad U-shaped valley is characteristic of a valley carved out by glaciers. The sides of the valley were also sheer and impressive.I had been over the entire road many years ago, say 40+, but this portion of the road we drove on this trip did not leave me with the feeling of teetering on the edge of the world that the earlier experience gave me, still I'm glad we did it.I'm sad that the visitor's center was closed, a downer, but after a look around we headed back down.We lucked out though...until the day we arrived the entire park had been socked in my smoke, but we had great views even though it was overcast.","September 3, 2018",4-star experience due to limited access to Going to the Sun Road due to wildfire - still beautiful,62,"Rexburg, Idaho",4

But one couldn't park as all the spaces are taken-for a long time- by hikers. I had to pass Logan Pass for lack of a parking space. And, the view was murky thanks to the California fires. This is now the third year fires have effected my trip. Crater Lake NP was completely invisible for smoke. Yosemite was closed due to fire. Last year at Yosemite one couldn't see up the valley. This is the future, friends. I think I may try the Parks in winter- less crowds and no fire means great views. PS on the way out was a long line of cars waiting to pay their $35 entrance fee.

River on one side and gorgeous mountain on the other side , some with snow and bits of a glacier . As you gain altitude the road narrows pretty quickly. It seemed like we turned a corner and wow we were on the tiny part of the road with a 6000 foot drop off , we both freaked out for a minute , ok a few minutes of “ look everybody else is doing it “ and “ we are ok “ pep talks and we keep going . The good thing is that everyone goes really slow . The big red buses and shuttle buses drive by slowly and cautiously. I mean the road is only 10 feet wide or so and you really feel like you are hugging the cliff . But once you relax , it is truly breathtaking! Walls of water seeping from rocks , glaciers in the distance. Waterfalls and tunnels .

After the visitor center you hug the hillside for awhile and then come down a bit to a much needed restroom stop lol . There were a few pullouts along the way but they were all full .

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This is a windy, narrow road with incredible scenery around every corner. The west side of the road was closed for the fire, but the east side was open and offered beautiful sights even when obscured by smoke. There are many turnouts, but they did begin to fill by late morning. We went early and didn't have any problem finding a spot to park on the way up; coming down we could see a lot more congestion. The driver doesn't get to see everything that passengers see, but there's no reason to stress over the drive, just take your time, pull out, and remember where you are. If you drive the whole thing or stop and turn around at the top, you'll want to visit the Logan Pass visitor center. It offers great views and hikes and is well maintained. It does get very busy so if you were stressed at all by the drive you might not enjoy the stress of the parking lot.","August 17, 2018",Just gotta do it,114,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5

We couldn’t go any further because of the fires of western side of the park.Still a spectacular drive.We hiked from the Logan Pass Visitors Center to the Hidden Lake Lookout (1.5 mi each way). Great hike and views. We saw three Mountain Sheep that were within a hundred yards. The sheep made the hike special.While driving we saw a Brown Bear cross the road right in front of us! We also saw a Black Bear at the little marina where they give boat rides. The rangers were there and said they were trying to work the Black bear back towards the creek.Unfortunately the smoke from the fires prevented us seeing the fantastic vistas, but it was still worth the trip.","August 15, 2018",Excellent Views!!,104,"Goodyear, Arizona",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,Did this drive both ways on August 9th and 10th and found it to be wonderful and not overly difficult. Guard rails and or Stone work always provide some comfort along the cliff facing portions and it really is only a small portion of the 51 miles of road which is treacherous in appearance or at least reputation. The portion from the “loop” to Logan Pass is perhaps the only portion of concern but again guard rails exist and you will not be driving very fast at all. If you have done the Bear tooth Highway this is less of a challenge. Don’t miss this great drive!,"August 15, 2018","Fantastic drive, not as scary as advertised",26,"Winnipeg, Canada",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,Having gone over this road many times in all the years that we go to the park our favorite time is earlier in the morning or early evening.

Everyone should do this in their lifetime.Note: if renting a car, advise to get a small SUV if possible. The roads are very well maintained, but there's a lot of climbing and braking as well as tight-turns.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,One of the most spectacular drives you will ever find. Remember that if you travel early in the mourning it's best to go from East to West to keep the sun glare out of your eyes. If you plan to visit just make sure to plan your days activities as much as possible. You will also have to be prepared to change and adapt because so many of the stops are jammed with people and there are no parking spaces. Be careful where you park on the Going To The Sun Road. We saw Rangers giving parking tickets to cars that were parked where they were not supposed to be and blocking traffic in Logan's Pass.

Also, be patient with your fellow travelers - just enjoy the beauty & don't let the slow traffic bother you! If you travel from east to west as we did, we found that many of the parking spots seemed to be oriented the opposite way.

Rangers would not let us stop at the Visitors center at the top of the hill due to traffic, said try again in 30 mins, but no where else to really wait nearby, so we carried on. Tip would be to do this drive early during the School Holidays. So we headed out to the east side and had a hamburger lunch sitting outside at a small bar at the turn off to Many Glaciers.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,Rode my bicycle up this road and it affords some spectacular views. The edge can be a little hairy at times as while there is a small barrier (about 2 feet) if you hit it wrong and with enough force on a bicycle I think it could simply launch you over the edge and in places it is a long way down. The road is narrow but the motorist for the most part share respectfully with the bicyclists (banned on the uphill from 11am - 4pm so get an early start if on a bicycle).

We saw very little wildlife - only a marmot perched on a rock and some birds.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"if you only have a day in the Glacier National park and want to see as much thing as possible, then drive along the Going-to-the-sun road is a good choice, you can either drive from East to West of from West to East, there are lots of points along the road for you to stop and take a look and take some good pictures. But the portion between the Apgar visitor center to Avalanche Creek has construction, lots of the pullouts in this portions are closed, so make us can't take a closer look to the McDonald falls, may be need to walk the trail in order to see the falls (a ta closer look), (I have attache the photos, not sure if this falls I see is the McDonald falls, I hope it is, but it's taken with a camera with 40x zoom in order to take this picture, so you see it's very far away, I suspend that some of the pullouts can have a closer look, but those are closed during the re-construction, so poor). besides, the lake McDonald, the Avalanche creek, the Logan pass, the St. Mary falls, etc are the main points along the road, if you don't drive, you can take the free shuttle bus to go to these points, but if you drive, you can take a look to even more points, e.g. the West tunnel (with overlook to the Heaven Peak), the weeping wall, triple arches, Oberlin bend (where you have a very very high chance to see the mountain goat, I see 2-3 there), the lunch creek (water flows down a natural rock staircase), Wile Goose island, etc. But for driving, there may be a risk that you can't find a parking space in peak season, so if any point you want to stay longer, and really want to hike, then better go to that ;point earlier, before 10am, of you may take shuttle to go there, for the other points where just pullout the car and take some picture, normally, there is space to park, as people don't stay long, just park for a few minutes to take pictures and then go. Even you drive thru; the road, and no need to spend time on waiting for parking, you still need to spend at least 5-6 hours to drive thru' all the points (with stop for a few minutes in each points), if you want to hike for 1-2 trails, then better prepare for 10 hrs or even more.","July 29, 2018",1 day trip in Glacier national park,141,United States,4

It is windy and curvy as you might expect for a mountain road, but the driving is not unsettling. We went to the Logan Pass visitor center (the biggest destination in the middle) two days. We did the Hidden Lake hike and the ""Garden Wall"" hike. Both were beautiful and had lots of wildlife. Most of the wildlife sightings that we had in the park were in the Logan Pass area or along this road. FYI, The road is PACKED on a typical summer day. We got there 7am-8am each day and got parking, but it was definitely filling up. When we left around noonish, the lot was full and blocked off to new cars. Then later in the day, as more earlybirds left, parking would open up again. There also are shuttles that will bring you to Logan Pass and other stops for trailheads.

Watch out for large RVs whose drivers hog the road and/or do not flatten their mirrors. We passed many of them.It is a very popular drive, so the parking spots at scenic overlooks and at the Logan Pass fill up quickly. I recommend beginning your drive early so you can be at the visitor's center before 10:00 a.m. The west side of the park is more rugged and scenic than the east side, thus, easier to drive.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I greatly enjoyed Glacier and Going to the Sun road.Pictures dont capture the feel of Glacier. The enormity and great beauty is phenomenal. I liked it better than Yellowstone and Yellowstone is wonderful itself. Going to the Sun road is about 50 miles long and you will want to stop at almost every scenic stop along the way. The hike to Hidden lake is a good way to get some exercise. Logan Pass was very busy on a mid July weekday. Not being from a mountainous climate I was a little reluctant to take other more extensive hikes alone. On the east side it took about an hour to get to Going to the Sun road, Stopped and talked to a Blackfoot Indian holding the construction stop sign in a work zone. They had been getting attacked by a Moose and they would use construction equipment to move him away and then he would keep coming back. Another crew had to deal with a Grizzly Bear.Allow at least 2 days to see and experience Glacier. In July the temp was around 80 degrees when I was there. Great for families or anyone. Still able to touch ice in several places though it was melting. A young Grizzly was eating huckleberries on a ledge above me and started to slide down in front of me as he was stretching to get every last one. The entry fee on to Going to the Sun was $35 for a 3 day pass if I remember correctly.A flight into Helena then an easy but scenic 3 hour drive to the east gate of Glacier and the Glacier park lodge at St Mary's worked well. Passed Egg mountain on the way where a mass extinction event had left the remains of dinosaurs from eggs to young and many full grown dinosaurs. Augusta and Choteau were a couple of Montana towns along the way. More experienced hikers might also like the Bob Marshall wilderness of about 1600 sq miles passed along the way.","July 26, 2018",A view of Glacier National Park,80,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5

Go to the 3 visitor's centers later in the day so to keep your mornings and evenings free. The road gets crowded early and if there is no parking at Logan Pass you will be waved on. No place to pull to the shoulder and walk back. Tickets are issued for illegal parking. The Red Bus and other tours always have space, so if in doubt pay for the tours.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I remember my first encounter with this spectacular highway in 1968 when I was 17. My family including my grandparents, cousins, aunt & uncle had just visited Banff and Jasper National Parks in Alberta, Canada for a family reunion. As spectacular as these parks were, nothing prepared me for the awesome alpine splendor of Going to the Sun Highway on a sunny day with waterfalls flowing across the highway. We ended up at Lake MacDonald Lodge where after being so entranced by the experience of traveling down this gorgeous highway, I promptly came up with the idea of taking the Gunsight Pass Trail, staying overnight at Sperry Chalet (which burnt down last summer). My uncle, two bothers and one or two cousins took this overnight hike leaving right from our hotel. My father and aunt (who did not accompany us) arranged to leave my uncle’s car at the other end of the trail so we could drive back to the hotel the following afternoon. It was the most spectacular 24 miles I have ever hiked.Today the highway has changed very little except for increased traffic. It is a must see attraction that should be savored with numerous stops.

We drove it in its entirety 2x round trip and both experiences were entirely different.The first time, it was raining and foggy up top which made the pass very scary. Going east, it gains elevation steadily and the cliff side is mostly on the passenger side after ""The Loop."" We allotted a day to drive the GTTS road as we have read that there are so many vistas that just are begging to be savored. Indeed. We have seen many folks who are stupid enough to step on edge of railing to get a selfie... no view is worth risking your life for. In july there were still snow up near Logan Pass. The stops we did were: The Loop, McDonald Creek, Avalanche Creek/Lake, Logan Pass, look before Logan Pass going east. The look out prior to Logan Pass when you are going east is a prime spot to see mountain goats. If you are the driver, you can easily be distracted to look at he views but mind you speed and other folks pulling out of vistas.

The Going to the Sun Road provides amazing access to countless breathtaking views of the mountains, valleys, waterfalls and lakes.

The road starts out on either side relatively flat for a while, but then it gets going rises and twists through crazy hairpin and switch back turns along narrow corridors carved right out of the cliff side. The mountain drops away precipitously from the side road side for much of the road, but don't worry there is stone wall guard rail running along side to keep you from driving off!The drive is meant to be taken slow both to enjoy the impossibly gorgeous views, but also because the driving requires care and lots of other visitors are driving the road as well. Unless you go very early in the morning, be ready to have slow downs, lines of cars and challenging parking along the turnouts. The turnouts are placed to allow visitors to pull over, get out, enjoy the views and take pictures. The major parking areas usually serve hiking trails and can fill up.

The road is a bit narrow and harrowing at times and not for nervous nelly drivers. But, everyone we encountered was friendly and excited to be there. My advice- If you can do it and have time, go from the eastern side to Logan Pass and return to the east. Stay in East Glacier that night. Take Route 2 across the bottom of the park. Then, go from the western side and return to West Glacier. Stay in West Glacier that night. Everything is so spread out and far apart that it takes a long time to get anywhere in the area. The road is in great shape and there sometimes are pullouts where parking is at a premium. That’s why you need to go both ways. If you miss a pullout one way, you’ll likely get in there on the return trip. On the western side, be sure to stop at the Weeping Wall pullout just before Logan Pass. We had a picnic lunch there and it’s as crowded as Logan Pass. Once at LP, just drive around the parking lot until someone pulls out. We waited a bit, but finally parked.

The hairpin turns on the west side are not for the faint of heart...on one trip we were stuck behind some poor lady who white knuckled it all the way down at about 5 mph. But the road is meant for leisurely drives with frequent stops at pullouts to marvel at the views. Also, watch out for wildlife.

There are many great places along the river on the western side to explore the river/creek, throw some stones, see the cedar trees, etc. There are good places on the eastern side to stop and have some views (Jackson Glacier lookout, Sun Point). And in between you have the incredible views of getting to Logan Pass and descending the other side. Traffic? Absolutely, because the road is closed until late June most years, and then it's two months of manic tourism. Step and narrow? Yup. You'll smell your brakes on the descent, and there are no gas stations along the way so go with a reasonably full tank. There isn't much to eat in the park either except Lake MacDonald.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,Learning about Going to the Sun Road is one of the main reasons for our trip to Glacier National Park. So glad we decided to take this trip this summer.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I LOVE taking scenic routes all throughout the country. We were camping on the east side of the park and I had heard that the east part of Going to the Sun Road was more mild than the west part. So we started out from the east side and drove to West Glacier. We turned around to head back to our camp site, and WOW, was driving it from the west side WAY scarier for me!!! I am terrified of heights, so I knew it would be a difficult drive for me, but it is SO WORTH IT!!!! It took us over 3 hours round trip, and could have taken much longer if we had stopped at all the scenic pull outs. I was driving a Subaru Outback with a roof top carrier on top, and it handled well. You just can’t imagine the scenery until you’re up there, white-knuckling it! :) ","July 10, 2018",Wow!!!! But scary!!!,13,,5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This is my favourite drive to take. Although the entire route is only open a short time...it is one not to be missed. We just drove it very shortly after it opened this year, and the waterfalls weren’t quite as spectacular as they can be. The drive is very narrow and winding at times and can not be done while towing a trailer or in large motor home. You will have to park it and use their tour bus. Either way...it is one natural beauty. ","July 10, 2018",Great drive..,21,"Radium Hot Springs, Canada",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,Great scenery! The west end follows next to the river for several miles before starting the climb to Logan Pass. The road is in excellent condition but you do have to stay alert for people pulling off and on to take pictures. Go as early as you can as many of the popular places fill up by mid-morning and there's no parking. Be sure to stop at McDonald Lake Lodge.,"July 10, 2018",Absolutely Georgeous,123,Fort Worth,5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"If you’re going in June or earlier, the Going To The Sun road may not be open. My family went the 3rd week of June 2018 and the road opened the day after we left. We knew it was a possibility that we’d miss it but we were still disappointed. I thought they would open it at least to Logan Pass however up until the day before it completely opened it was only open to Avalanche on the west side and Jackson Glacier on the east side. The drive to Avalanche is not very scenic because tree coverage blocks many views. If the road is closed, the East side is much better for scenery. The park is best for hiking, but if you’re not capable/interested to do 8+ mile hikes, there’s limited options. My top recommendation if the road is closed is to spend time in nearby Waterton Lakes NP in Canada. That park has fantastic views and open meadows which make it more likely to see wildlife. The good things about going to GNP in June are fewer crowds, fuller waterfalls, and a chance to bike the road. However, if I was re-doing my trip, I'd go later in the summer to ensure the road is open.","July 10, 2018",Going to the Sun Road- don't go to Glacier if it's not open,5,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",3

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"If this road is open, try to make time to experience it as the scenery is incredible and even the road is interesting. there are some pull off/viewing spots along the way to Logan Pass. Be advised that around noon-time, the parking lot is slammed in the peak travel months so prepare to loop around for a while or try to get there early. A couple of interesting hikes await you at Logan Pass (the Hidden Lake Trail is very suitable for families with kids of any age) and you may even see some wildlife 9beyond the inpatient sorts you may encounter in the parking lot!). For cyclists who want a challenge, you can ride this road at certain times so if you are interested, check with the park. For those who who might like something a little different, try the open topped 'red bus' tours ... there are a variety of options. On both side of the pass, you'll find camping options (vehicles more than 21 feet can not use, scenic views and hiking trails.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The Going-to-the-Sun Highway cuts right across the middle of Glacier National Park, east to west. An interesting thing to note is that it doesn't matter which way you drive it, it will always be spectacular and the views are different in each direction. So if you have enough time, it might be nice to do this. The GTTS Highway was finished in 1932 and once I saw it I thought about the engineering feat it was to do this then. It is a completely paved, two-lane highway and 50-miles in length. It has mountain grades and some switchbacks. Please go slowly as several areas are congested and so you don't miss anything. There are many scenic viewpoints along the way to stop, park safely, and take pictures, Some of the pull-outs are past 'the spot', so there are people walking in these areas.The entrance to the Park is 30-miles from Kalispell and from this direction you will enter at the Apgar Visitor Center.We drove west to east.Just after the Visitors Center, you'll find Lake McDonald. Stop here and look into the crystal water at the colorful rocks on the bottom. Don't miss the Lake McDonald Lodge. Equipment rentals are available.Avalanche Creek has hiking, camping and picnic areas. Just past that is the Trail of the Cedars. Stop and park here and stroll along this 6 tenths of mile trail on raised boardwalk and suitable for wheelchairs and strollers, under the ancient trees. There is a peace here that is hard to describe.Heaven's Peak is here. There is a nice big pullout here where you can admire this mountain. You'll also drive past the Weeping Wall, with run-off cascading down the steep hillside onto the highway. Roll up your windows!The weather is unpredictable any time- we drove through rain, fog, and sleet.Next is Logan Pass, where GTTS Highway crosses the Continental Divide at 6,646-feet. There is a Visitor Center there and some fine views. Also plenty of wind.The highway reaches the end of the park as it runs alongside of St. Mary's Lake for the last 10-miles. There is a nice picnic area there and a narrow dirt track which goes down to the water through a field of wildflowers.There are vehicle length and width restrictions along parts of the Highway and most of it is closed from late September to May.In 1983 Going-To-The-Sun Road was included in the National Register of Historic Places and in 1985 was made a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.","July 6, 2018",An Outstanding Must-Do!,532,"Phoenix, Arizona",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Our trip to Glacier this year was June 27-July 1, so I really didn't think the Road would be open. What an amazing surprise that it would be open for our visit! We drove in through the west side to drive east to Saint Mary campground. I am a huge baby when it comes to heights, and everyone told me that it was a beautiful, but terrifying, drive. So I was a little nervous as we made our way up, but any fear I had melted away as those majestic mountains rose before me. It's definitely not as scary as people make it out to be. We ended up driving the road every day we were there, and every day the views were just a little different from before. There were days when it was sunny, and some where you drove right through the clouds; but it was always beautiful. My 4 year old especially loved going through the tunnels. Some of the pull-offs are a little sketchy, and NOT toddler safe! Everyone needs to be cautious though. Watch where you are stepping when taking pictures and selfies! The drive is slow going, so make sure you're not tailgating. The road is windy, and drivers tend to make sudden stops, so you really need to pay attention while driving.No matter how many pictures you've seen of Going to the Sun road, it won't prepare you for actually seeing it in person. It's truly jaw dropping.","July 4, 2018",Just as incredible as they say.,15,,5

In the summer (July to Aug) it gets very busy and is very slow going, however the scenery is well worth the trip. The drive is very short and if you want the best experience is to go over one way and then turn around and go back the other way, it is a different road each way.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Thirty years in construction (the Great Depression halted work midway through), Glacier's Going-to-the-Sun is a feat of public engineering on a par with Hoover Dam. Billed as ""America's Rooftop,"" the 50-mile route offers unparalleled views of the park's incomparable majesty. Rising from Lake McDonald over the Continental Divide at Logan Pass, then descending to the park's east entrance at St. Mary's, the road offers one eye-popping, jaw-dropping vista after the next. Visitor center advisories encourage guests to take advantage of the free shuttle to avoid parking logjams, but if one avoid peak times and exercises courtesy, spaces can be found at most observation points. Driving the road does require above-average care and reasonably steady nerves, as certain stretches lack guard rails, and some turns can be quite hairpin. If you have to choose between the west-east route to Logan Pass over vice-versa for a manageable half-day outing, opt for the west-east route, which bypasses at least one major glacier but otherwise provides more diverse scenery.","July 4, 2018",magnificent beyond words,513,"Santa Fe, New Mexico",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The road is well maintained (unlike others in the park). Is worth driving and at times can be a bit intimidating when driving the pass. The road is wide enough for two normal size vehicles, but visually it doesn't seem that way when you're driving it. During our stay, we drove it over 3 times each way. Many stops along the way worth checking out. If you happen to be trying to check out wildlife in the dawn/dusk hours don't bother... the park rangers were quick to keep running people (and animals) off. Even if you were safely pulled over. I understand why they are there and what they are doing, but slowing down traffic for a bit to see a bear or other animal shouldn't be that big of a deal. They would even pull close to the animals and put on their loud horn/sights/siren to scare them off. Viewing wildlife is an important reason we chose to visit the park.

The rangers told us to drive to Avalanche Point, which was totally jammed with cars...literally gridlocked. An over stressed ranger began screaming at people for parking in campsites. The signage was unclear and folks were just looking for places to park. He told us to go back to the visit center and ride the shuttle. We went back to the visitor center and were told the shuttle was not running...total confusion. In addition to this, some brilliant person decided it was a good idea to repave all of the ""pulloffs"" on the west side of the park at the same time.

The scenary is amazing and there are plenty of places to pull over for pictures and quick hikes up a mountainside to get a better picture. Be careful driving around as many people stop abruptly and some people walk across the road in front of you to get to a view point. The drive up to Logan Pass and back down to St. Mary Lake is the best portion of the drive. This trip we drove with our two daughters from Many Glacier Hotel to Lake McDonald Lodge and back.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I have been looking forward to driving this road since I first started planning this trip some time ago. It had only been opened up some days before we got there so the timing was just right. We drove it from west to east starting at the Westgate about 1 p.m. the first several miles are not really bad it's all wooded and it doesn't get steep until after you pass what they call the loop. When I say steep I mean a sharp drop-off down the side of the mountain. Driving west to east means the passenger side will be right on the edge. My wife wasn't crazy about this but she was a trooper and made it in Great fashion but she did keep her eyes closed most of the way. The west side of it has to be the worst side. there are places where the road is very narrow for two cars and the cliff sticks out into the road it seems, if you're not careful you could hit your car. once you cross over at Logan pass the road down the east side is really not that bad. Logan pass has a nice Visitor Center and restrooms with a large parking lot which does get full during the busy time of the day. There are lots of places to stop to look at views and waterfalls as you drive the road but even those pull-offs can get crowded. The views from Logan pass itself are just spectacular. when we first got to the top, before the visitor center there was a mountain goat grazing along the side of the road. I believe this road was built back in the day by the CCC which gives it an historical aspect everyone should experience. Glacier National Park itself is a beautiful Park but if you don't do a lot of hiking you can't see much of it but the road gives you that experience of a lifetime.","June 29, 2018",Great views straight out and straight down,25,"Round Rock, Texas",5

We drove from St. Mary's as far as we could go (to Jackson Glacier overlook), and hiked on the Going-to-the-Sun Road to Logan's Pass. Some bikers went the entire road from East to West.

It can be harrowing at times when you look down and there’s a straight drop outside your window, but it’s just part of the experience. There can be a lot of traffic, so be prepared for that.

On a side note, while visiting GNP (or any NP)...please take your leftover food/garbage with you...it really made me sad/mad/angry to see people toss their banana peels, etc. on the ground. The animals in any national park cannot associate humans and food...their lives depend on it...by feeding them, leaving your food/trash, or getting too close for photos, ""selfies"", etc...you are contributing to their death...wild animals that lose their natural fear of people are killed.","June 26, 2018",Plan your trip when the road is FULLY OPEN!!!,29,"Sun City Center, Florida",3
Going-to-the-Sun Road,This was a wonderful trip. Our first time we went up one side in the Red Bus tour and it was worth every penny. That was our initial education to Glacier Park and we loved it. Then we decided that we had to see everything so we drove the East Glacier Park and stayed over night at the lodge. The next day we drove the entire going to the sun road back to the west side and stopped at every point of interest there is. AWSOME to say the least. This is an absolute must due at least once. The glaciers are melting so the sooner the better to plan your trip.,"June 25, 2018","AT LEAST ONCE IN A LIFETIME, IT'S A MUST",26,"Newman Lake, Washington",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We very much enjoyed our trip. It was part of our honeymoon. It was beautiful. We road on the Sun Tour bus and Derek was our guide. He was great and helpful always smiling. Unfortunately we didn't know how cold it would be in June, part of the road was still closed. It was at freezing by the time we got to the top. There was rain,sleet and snow.I would totally recommend going just be prepared.","June 23, 2018",Sun Road at Glacier National Park,3,"Bentonville, Arkansas",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Gorgeous area, don’t get me wrong...but do not, I repeat DO NOT go before the road is open. It’s super frustrating to get to the blocked off part. We did the west side one day, where we are staying, and the east the next. The road closure means you have to drive at least TWO hours out of your way to get from one side to the other. On the west side, we did the Avalanche Lake hike, and the waterfalls hike on the east. We were really sad thinking about how much time we wasted in the car instead of enjoying the park.The most frustrating thing about it all is that the plowing is done. They are taking advantage of the closure to do some maintenance work...grrr! Oh, and the west side also has some pretty hikes that you can’t even access because the parking pullouts are all ripped up for...you guessed it...maintenance. So that cuts out even more of the little you can access. And don’t park on the roads near said pullouts, we heard you’ll get a hefty ticket!","June 22, 2018",Don’t go when the road isn’t fully open!!,22,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",3
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The website said $30 but they charged $35, and when I told the person working at the gate, he was rude. The visitor center on the west side was very small and had little to offer. We went in mid-June but most all the road was closed due to supposed snow. We did not see any wildlife. There was not much to do in this park, as compared to other national parks. We paid $35 to drive about ten minutes and see the same views we saw for free around Flathead Lake and Big Mountain in Whitefish. It felt like a really expensive toll road, so I would make sure it is all open before giving it a try and only go if you can be flexible with dates. Of course, this is a review of how the national park is run, because the natural beauty of it all is beyond excellent.","June 22, 2018",Really expensive toll road,14,"Atlanta, Georgia",2
Going-to-the-Sun Road,First we drove in from Ohio. I kept hope the road would be open. We entered at St Mary’s. First the fire damage was so sad. Then the bad news the road was only open 15 miles. So we saw the lake and one mountain set. And had to turn around. I’m not understanding cause they’ve been plowing since the end of April and it’s only 29 miles. So it was kind of disappointing. The visitor center was amazingly small on the inside. And the bathrooms were small and three stalls only. ,"June 20, 2018",Beautiful but,38,"Columbiana, Ohio",4

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"You have to do this if you come to the park. Make sure and check the road status before you go, it sometimes doesn't open till late July.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"On our first day in Glacier we decided to take the shuttle bus through the park starting from the Apgar National Park visitor’s center. Park Rangers are here as well as informative interpretative rooms and clean bathrooms. The shuttle bus pick-up area is on the other side of the Apgar Center, opposite where the cars park. There is no question that the early birds who get there first have first opportunity to enter these 12 person busses first. Unfortunately, the day we arrived the park hit all-time records in the number of people who traveled by shuttle busses. Some of the locations we had to wait over an hour for a bus. The second day we decided to use our car.My wife fears roads like “Going to-the-Sun Road.” She does not like the edges of these roads. There is a vehicle limit of 21 feet long, 10 ft high and 8ft wide. The road is 50 miles long. For those with long RV’s they would have to take Route 89. After the first time through, my wife’s fears lowered a bit. Everyone goes slowly. This is definitely not a speedway. I was lucky to have my daughter driving.The Red Tour busses—known as Red Jammers-- would be a neat way to travel through the park. It is quite the popular thing to do riding in these over-sized open busses. The drivers are known as “Jammers” as they maneuver the gears. If you don’t like to drive on a narrow mountain road, the Red Jammers would be a superb alternative to having someone knowledgeable driving. At the highest part of Going-to-the-Sun Road is Logan’s Pass. This famous pass is 6646 feet high and marks the Continental Divide. Another well done Visitor’s center greets you with plenty of bathrooms. Parking is limited. Get there early if you really want a spot, or get lucky.Around the Visitors Center are two famous trails. We walked half way up Hidden Lake Trail before deep snow turned us around. In July a young child was sledding down the hill. We also saw numerous wild flowers and even a large marmot. People with binoculars could see a Brown bear and cubs in the far distance. Across the road is Highline Trail. My wife refused to go as there is a ledge that you are holding onto a rope. This trail is not for anyone with fear of heights. A large Logan Pass sign is just down the road for a good picture opts. On the east side of Glacier is a modern Saint Mary National Park entrance. The small village of St. Mary’s is just down the road. We found Snowgoose Grill to be quite good with inviting views. One of my friends has traveled to over sixty National Parks. They look at Glacier National Park as being one of the best, if not the best National Park. It is surely in the top five with Grand Canyon, Yosemite and Yellowstone as being extremely popular. I like Zion National Park in Utah. Fires in the past several years have open some of the land up. You can actually “look” inside the forest and possibly see a hidden lake. We did have “smoky” days, but the beauty of Glacier is everywhere nonetheless. Glacier National Park and driving “Going-to-the-Sun Road” should be on your bucket list. The people in the surrounding communities are friendly and willing to help you have a good time.

Construction was taking place everywhere. However, this was a once in a lifetime trip out West for our family, so we decided to soak up all that we could. The road was opened to the parking are at Lake Macdonald Lodge, so we parked there and walked up to Johns Lake Loop Trail. It was a breathtaking hike since the run off from the mountains was in full force. The waters were powerful and a gorgeous teal color. We saw lots of white water, falls, and we even crossed paths with a black bear within 50feet of us at the end of our hike. Gorgeous hike, wonderful day despite limited sections of the road open.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Going-to-the-Sun Road is a must for your bucket list. From the East you start out at St. Mary's and slowly gain elevation as you travel along Lake Mary. Watch for bears in the nearby pine trees. There are pull outs where you can stop along the road and admire the scenery and wildlife, however in summer months they will be crowded. The road does require your full attention, so pull over when you can to enjoy the vistas. At Logan Pass there is a larger parking lot & visitor center, but our experience is that if you arrive there at mid morning or later, you'll likely not find a parking place. Also near Logan Pass, we've always seen big horn sheep and mountain goats. Neither seem afraid of people, but remember they are wild animals. On the other side of Logan Pass, the road seems to narrow some, but that's where you'll be able to see waterfalls and a big canyon. Take your time and enjoy the drive. It is gorgeous and totally worth your time. An alternative to driving is to take a ride on a red bus and allow the driver to enlighten you about the park's history while you enjoy the landscape and animals.","May 10, 2018",A must do for your bucket list,85,"Joliet, Montana",5

The visitor center at Logan Pass is also very nice.Hiking: Trail of the Cedars - a paved trail and very pretty. Avalanche Lake 1.9 miles one way. The lake reflecting the mountains made for gorgeous photography. Just keep your backpack closed - those chipmunks will try to get inside for a snack.We did not use the shuttle system so can't comment on that.

We were also told that they closed the east side gate in the summer of 2017 (actually all three east entry points: Many Glacier, St. Mary, and Two Medicine) because of the horde of people who are now visiting.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Check before you go to make sure the snow has been cleared and the road is open. We visited in early July and drove Going to the Sun from West Glacier to East Glacier then returned via US2. There was still some snow on the mountain peaks and it was melting and running down the hillsides in spectacular waterfalls. We have driven many scenic routes and byways all over the country and this one is definitely one of the most awe-inspiring! Allow about half a day to drive it (one-way) and stop at the popular viewpoints; longer if you want to take a hike or two. The road itself is narrow with sheer drop-offs, and in some places there are no guardrails. The route hugs the side of the mountains, so it is curvy but there are only a few places with tight hairpins. If driving this sort of road makes you anxious, then you may want to consider taking a shuttle or Red Bus Tour that will take you to all the highlights. My main tip is to start as early as possible because parking at the overlooks and viewpoints is limited. On the day we went the parking lot at Logan Pass was full by about 9:30, and we heard they closed the road and stopped letting people drive in about 10-10:30 because it was so congested. Do a little research about the points of interest so you will know where to look and stop along the road and don't miss anything.

Continuing north there will be pullouts on left for views of creek. A parking area on the right about 4 miles past Trail of Cedars has a restroom.~3 miles past the restroom, pass through West Tunnel. After tunnel, enter “The Loop”- the only switchback. Upper and lower parking areas (both on right) in the hairpin turn for great views. Restroom at shuttle stop (just before curve). After The Loop, there are several small pullouts on right for views of the valley.2.7 miles past the hairpin there is a pullout on the right for Bird Woman Falls (in teh distance). Just around the bend from there, Haystack Creek trickles down the rocks from above left and passes under the road. No parking here, but amazing views of valley on right. Go slow and have camera ready. Don’t miss parking area on right at Big Bend (about .5 mile past Haystack)!About a mile further, pass the Weeping Wall on left then pullout area on right in big sweeping turn.Begin watching for Triple Arches ahead, will be able to see stone arches holding up the road as approach a right turn ahead.1.5 miles past the arches, stop at Oberlin Bend (hairpin to curves to left, parking on right).

Going-to-the-Sun Road,Going-to-the-Sun Road is one of the most magnificent roads in the United States. The road is engineered in a way that does not detract from the natural beauty of Glacier National Park. We spent several days in the park driving various sections of the road each day as we explored trails and sights along the way. Keep the park map handy as you go. A little advance research will help you to know where you want to stop. Overlooks and trails of varying lengths and difficulty are worth a stop. Begin each day early for easier parking in the morning. Take a sack/picnic lunch for a stop at a location where you plan to spend more time.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I've been to 29 national parks and done a lot of amazing drives, but this one is far and away the most fantastic. From the mountain goats to the waterfalls to the terror that your car might drive off the mountain in the fog, this one is AMAZING!Hints:- It's not unheard of for the road to open the week of 4th of July. Plan accordingly. Going the last week of June? You might not be able to drive this.- Go early in the day or go around dinner. The middle the day is crazy, and there is no where to park at all. During dinner, everyone goes back to their hotels and RVs and spends the rest of the night in, the road empties out like crazy. We cheated even further, we'd throw our camp stove in the car and cook dinner at a picnic area, so we'd not have to go back to the campground at all.- The early and late bonus - ANIMALS! We saw a lot of them, including bears, because they are most active at dawn at dusk.- Anywhere you can pull over, pull over. There isn't a bad spot on this road. We walked under an ice arch (snow was still melting), spotted mountain goats on a cliff side, admired waterfalls, and took some short hikes... all OUTSIDE the car. - If you can, plan to do this one at least twice. Our first time over (our first day in the park), it was PERFECT. Clear blue skies. Were thrilled to see mountain goats up on the cliffs. Were MORE thrilled to see mountain goats six feet away on the way back. We went back over once more out fifth day in the park (we were moving campsites to West Glacier) and it was a foggy, soupy, white knuckle driving mess. If we'd just had that second time, I would have been very sad.This drive alone is worth coming from any corner of the globe to do. We drove a week from New Jersey with a 4 and a 2 year old in the back of the car to do it. Our companion flew in from Tokyo. Taking away the rest of our adventures here, this alone would have made all the hassle worthwhile.","January 17, 2018",Can I give six stars?,171,South Jersey,5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,Our 5th time did not disappoint even with some smokiness from forest fires in canada. Our advice is to get to the park early before the crowds hit the pass then do a walk and then drive back late afternoon after the crowds have gone. Otherwise you will find the car parking places full and be in a moving traffic jam. We highly recommend driving west to east first thing then stop at Sunrift gorge parking area and walk towards St Mary's Falls. The first mile of the walk is stunning with views over the lake and mountains opposite.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We are so glad we came back to Glacier National Park during the summer months. Our winter visits did not suffice. All though you can use a free shuttle, I would advise you to not unless you are just hopping off a bus to take a long hike. We wasted over 3 hours and got nowhere, but that time did include taking the same bus system back to our car to do this road on our own. Also, too much waiting in line and still not catching the next bus due to the line. Use your own car. We never had any problems pulling over or parking. Everybody is stopping and starting just as you are unless you are going for a long hike. It will take all day, because you will need to go back the same way you came.

Prepare for long slow moving lines of cars. Relax and take your time. Plan a solid day to see everything and stop often. As another reviewer mentioned, be sure to take along plenty of water and a picnic lunch. There are many lovely spots to sit and eat.

It will be crowded, especially on the weekends, but plan to pull off often, take advantage of the numerous places to go and hike and experience the wildlife and amazing views.

Our kids loved the weeping wall, it was gushing water on the way into the park and a few days later on our way out it was already a lot less water but still pretty neat to drive through. We went around the second week in July and the road I think just opened the week prior to our visit... We would've been so disappointed if we couldn't have done this drive.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I drove in from the west side, and every turn was jaw dropping. The drive is easy as there is only 1 switch back, and although very tight everyone drives 10mph. No one tailgates, there are even signs on your way into the park reminding you tailgating isn't polite. I pulled over a bunch of times to the pictures enjoy the view, and take pictures for others. Everyone is super friendly. How could you not be when you're surrounded by so much beauty. I drove the road end to end twice and up to the pass a couple more times. At dawn the views are spectacular. Well worth to drive down the st Mary's side and see the glacier and st Mary's lake. I drove back at sunset. I wanted to go to the start gazing at Logan pass but was scared of the drive at night. If i had stayed on the east side the drive up to the pass is easier, less tight turns, and I would have definitely done night start gazing. The road is about 2hrs in total.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,Nothing can possibly prepare you for this gorgeous drive. At every twist and turn you will be awed and amazed. We were unable to get on the red car tour ( book early if your going) so we just drove it . We started from the east side. dDid the Boat tour at St. Mary lake. Stopped at the falls for a light hike ( to pick up my brother in law and his girlfriend- SINCE they missed the boat ride back. LOL) so we had to pick them up and just hoped they stayed put since we couldn't call them. NO CELL coverage in most of the park- in case you were wondering!  Once we picked them up we headed to Logans Pass where we spent a few hours. Then we kept going. Made a few stops at some amazing sites along the road. Took tons of pics. Took a very COLD swim in one of the rivers along the road ( it was on the West side of the park not too far from Lake McDonald.. NO idea the name since there are thousands of rivers along the way). It was gorgeous. Fun climbing on rocks and down trees). We were in the park the entire day. We started at 8 am from Whitefish lake and we were back by 8pm.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"One of the highlights of our trip was driving the Going to the Sun Road. We drove it from East to West, which is less scary as we were driving the inside lane, farther from the cliff. The views were amazing. We loved stopping at this area right before Avalanche Lake where that was a beautiful pool of glacier water. We jumped in and though it was FREEZING, it was also exhilarating. The only bummer was that the forrest fires were burning at the time of our trip and there was a lot of smoke in the air blocking our views and many trails were closed. Can't wait to go back!","October 20, 2017",Amazing Views,4,,5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"According to many guides and sites this an amazing place. The few things we were able to see confirm the books words, but because of essentially heavy smoke the great views were impeded. Valleys filled up with smoke, eyes starting to ache and a lot of animals fled the fire to safer grounds. But make no mistake, do not let this withhold you from visiting the park. In the end we have some nice souvenirs from Agpar, two medicine and the falls near St Mary lake, only a short hike from the main road. A fair warning for visitors going during the summer months. The time of my visit the place was very crowded, so I can imagine how it is during summer months. Parking spaces near the sightseeing spots and starting point for hikes are very limited. Go early; it is my guess that within a short time Glacier will evolve to a situation like Zion NP and Grand canyon were you are only allowed to access the park by shuttle bus","October 16, 2017",average score but probably caused by unfortunate time of the visit during the huge forest fires.,42,"Manosque, France",3

We were able to drive in the opposite direction, going west, and it would have been great if we could have driven back to Apgar at the end of our trip. At that time, however, the fires caused the road to be closed, so we had to circle around the park.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"On our trip, we spent a few days in the West Glacier area (rental house) and a few more in the St Mary area (lodge). So when we finally did the cross-over via Going To The Sun Road, it was from West to East. We were there in the high season (August). If you want to do Logan Pass Visitor Center, and also want to have time to stop along the way before you get there, I HIGHLY recommend getting to the park entrance by 6am. Yes, it is early, but you will avoid having to pass by pullouts because they are too crowded, and possibly not getting a parking spot at Logan Pass. You won't feel as rushed. Also not that if you are staying in the Columbia Falls area, and expect to do the whole road out to St. Mary's, or even to do a Grinnell hike, you will be driving a very long time, and have a very long day.The road itself is pretty. If you are afraid of heights, you may not want to look over the edge as you drive. Many places do not have standard metal guardrails, just periodic boulders. If, because of time, you can only do pullouts or get up to Logan Pass, and can do a less-than-moderate hike, I recommend getting to Logan Pass and enjoying the scenery there. Do the first part of the Hidden Lake trail. Going from Logan Pass to St. Mary's, the scenery becomes less dramatic, so plan on less time needed for pullouts there. Be aware that the rangers at the West side entrance don't seem to be very organized. We had an annual pass, and had been in the park a few times, but there is no 'express' lane for people who do not need to speak with a ranger at the entrance for information about the park. In high season you can waste 15-25 minutes in line because of disorganization. It doesn't seem like much, but we literally got the last parking spot a couple of times. 2 minutes later and we would have been out of luck to see some sights.","September 23, 2017",Start early to not be disappointed,94,"Estes Park, Colorado",5

The shuttles go there from the lodges and may work better if you plan a hike. We could not find parking to do one of the hikes! It was very annoying. But we just consoled ourselves by pulling over at a pull out and eating lunch with the most amazing view this side of Switzerland.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Unfortunately, the visit was marred by the wildfires. Our views were obscured by the hazy smoke and it really impaired our ability to enjoy the views. Visibility was limited to a few miles. Even with such heavy level of smoke, we could definitely see the beauty of the area.Note, the road is a west/east road. We took the west to east route. The first few miles consists of skimming along the shores of Lake McDonald. Note that trees obscure most views of the lake along the way. The next few miles are then the most picturesque of the drive as you will wind your way up winding mountain passes with steep vertical drops. The construction of the road must have been amazing and truly difficult. You will have magnificent views of the valley along the way. You will climb all the way to Logan Pass. Note, the visitor center parking situation is extremely difficult there and in several different parking areas!Once you pass Logan Pass, you will descend towards St Mary Lake. You will pass areas that were devastated by fire most likely a few years ago.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We drove this road once (each way) on our 9-day trip to Glacier and that was enough for us. This was early September and there were massive fires across the park and in Canada so visibility was terrible, this may be why we did not run into that much traffic which was the saving grace of this drive. Due to the smoke we were unable to see a lot of the scenery around us, but even without the reduced visibility, we were not impressed with the access available on the road to pull off and see the amazing views that the road is known for. We started at about 6:45 driving along Lake McDonald and quickly stopped at one of the pullouts to walk down to the shore and take pictures of the misty morning. After the lake ends, the road follows a river for a ways so we had our eyes peeled for any wildlife getting an early morning drink, but it seems like the fires had driven all the animals out of the park. Finally, the road starts to climb up to its only large switchback. This is when you start having views of the mountains and valley below. There were a few pullouts along the way, but most would only fit two or three cars comfortably.Most slow drivers that we ran into were polite enough to pull into one of the pullouts to let us pass. I could not tell if they were just trying to enjoy the views or if they were uncomfortable driving at the speed limit on the road. There were two pockets of construction occurring on the road where they appeared to be re-paving sections.We got to Logan’s Pass by 8:15am and quickly found a parking spot. The lot was probably only about 1/3 full at that time. We did two big hikes out of Logans Pass and by the time we left that afternoon the lot was insane with cars fighting each other for spots.We finished out the going to the sun road after our hikes, driving the last 20 miles to St. Mary’s, but there was almost no visibility. We could tell that we were driving alongside a lake, but not much else. At the park entrance we pulled a u-turn and drove the long way back to our campsite at fishcreek.","September 17, 2017",Not very accessible for sightseeing,40,"Baltimore, Maryland",3

There are quite a few pull outs and small parking areas along the road, but be careful of other cars as it is a busy narrow road. Well worth driving in both directions and the earlier you get into the Park the quieter it will be.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Going to the Sun is considered to be on of the greatest motorcycle rides in the country, and with good reason. Winding mountain roads and great scenery the full way. There was some road construction in progress requiring a full-stop and wait for about 10 min to allow on-coming traffic to pass through areas where there was only one traffic lane. I rode my Kawasaki Concours through the area during the last week in Aug. By the second week of Sep there is expected to be several inches of snow. Plan accordingly, especially if on a motorcycle.","September 14, 2017","A ""Must Do"" Motorcycle Ride",104,"Burnsville, Minnesota",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,Were we so anxious to see the park..our first time here. Started out early as we were coming from Evergreen MT & riding on a motorcycle. It was a little brisk in the shade but the sun was warm. We came across our first road construction delay by Lake McDonald...wait..wait..wait. We get moving again then enter a part of the valley the smoke had settled in....so smokey. Start up the GTTSR & construction stop #2. Long...long...long...hot wait & lots of cars. The views weren't good..to much smoke.We finally make it to the summit & so many cars that we really couldn't get into the parking lot ( this was on a Tues) so we headed down the hill & stopped at a picnic area on Saint Mary Lake. It was pretty quiet here so we took our lunch & headed for a waterfall hike. It was so beautiful here...cool..waterfall mist..not to many people. We returned the same way we came from & stopped off at the summit as the traffic congestion wasn't as bad. The views were much better as the winds had shifted the smoke on our way down on GTTSR. Still had construction stops but they weren't as long...all in all it was a nice day.,"September 14, 2017",Our first time on Going-to-the-Sun Road...hummmm,220,"Simi Valley, California",4
Going-to-the-Sun Road,You see all the pictures of the bears and animals crossing the roads and in the fields. Where did they go? We drove from St. Mary entrance to logans pass and back.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Definitely worth doing.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Going-to-the-Sun Road is a vertiginous, but beautiful drive through the heart of Glacier National Park. We stayed at a B&B in Whitefish, on the western side of the park, and drove into the park every morning we were there - about a 35 minute drive to the Apgar visitor center. The day we drove the Going-to-the-Sun Road was the first day that smoke from the wildfires to the west of the park started to obscure views. Even though we did not have the clear vistas that are seen in the best weather, the scenery on the drive is breath-taking. The warning is that if you, or the driver of your vehicle, suffer from height aversion or from vertigo, it might be best to let someone else drive - maybe riding in one of the red bus tours that exist specifically for that purpose. The drive is full of hairpin curves next to sheer drops just past a tiny shoulder of the road - very challenging for folks with vertigo!  It might be best to take one of the open buses in any event, because there are so many things you will want to see - believe me, you're better off not trying to see them while driving!","September 12, 2017",Excellent - with a warning,46,"Alexandria, Virginia",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I ended up going from Glacier West east almost to St Mary's and then turning back west towards Glacier West and on to Kalispell. I highly recommend going both directions, there is just so much to see and some things/views you can only see from one direction. There are quite a few places to stop and take photos but not a lot of parking ( another reason to go both ways). I have a thing for waterfalls so I stopped quite a bit. I would suggest starting early going westbound to miss the suns glare, take your time, you really can't go over 45 while in the park anyway, then turning around and heading east. There are also plenty of places to stop and hike along the way. There was construction on the day I was there, but that just meant longer to enjoy the views. I didn't realize until much later how far the fires had come into the park and how lucky I was to complete the drive.","September 12, 2017",So Beautiful!,24,"Austin, Texas",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The best way to truly experience Going-to-the-Sun Road from the US side is to overnight in Kalispell, Montana. Set out at about 11am and head towards Apgar as part of the Glacier National Park. Once you enter the GNP, you are driving on the road. It is a truly scenic drive with untouched beauty at every turn and curve!! Nature at its peak of perfection. You can exit at Saint Mary and loop back south to Kalispell via the 464 or go back the 82 miles and see the sights from the opposite direction! There are many spots to take pictures but the memories will last longer! Phone service is nil to minimal along the way. One of the most scenic drives you will ever be on.

We were there the last few days of August and the smoke from the fire near Lake McDonald really dulled the views unfortunately. If you are thinking about going still this year, you may want to check with the park first and see if the smoke is still an issue. When we were there they said they expected it to last until snow fall in October. Plenty of turnouts so you can get out and enjoy the scenery. Logan pass is a disaster as far as parking goes.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This road is the highlight of GNP. The best way to explore it is starting you trip early in the morning. Logan Pass parking lot usually packed by 9am. It is better to explore it from top of the mountain ( I mean Logan Pass). There are many overlook spots for nice view. There are also couple places you can stop for either short or long hiking trails. We arrived GNP during wild Forrest fire. The west side road is blocked but you still can access part of road from east side ( start from St Mary). Depend on wind blowing direction that the beautiful view of GNP probably can not be viewed. However we were super lucky which we drove through the whole road before they announced the road block. If you started from west side, you will pass lake McDonald then not far north you will get to couple trails. Half way to Logan pass there is heavens point which is so beautiful early in the morning. At Logan pass there are two hiking trails. The more popular trails is hidden lake overlook. When keep going to east, there are many waterfalls hiking trails and trails lead you to great view of st Mary lake and mountains. Do not miss sun point nature trail.

Bike have to be off the road by 11 AM so if you're planning in riding, start VERY early. The main climb is 4000"" at a steady 6% grade.

It was easy to picture horses and buggies and the autos of the old days climbing this road. Thankfully, vehicles longer than 21 feet are prohibited on the Going-to-the-Sun Road but there is still plenty of traffic during peak times and be prepared to encounter some road construction. That being said, just plan smart if you are easily frustrated.......start your drive early in the day or head out after 5pm when crowds clear out of the park.

Then this road (as per my point #1) can be terrifying! It's scarier heading West to East as you're against the edge, not hugging the mountainside.3- There are far too many people coming on this road relative to the infrastructure - there just are not enough parking places! And some of the parking pull-outs that exist are suicidally dangerous, with no visibility and blind corners. 4- Poor signage (or almost NO signage!) throughout the park.5- Logan Pass, the most popular area, has very limited parking, and rude / unhelpful ""park assistants"" (what else to call them?) urging you to keep driving around the parking lot instead of waiting for a spot to open up. It's crazy and massively frustrating!6- The shuttle system is crazy! There are no signs! How do you know where to park? Or where to get picked up by a shuttle? Or how you get back to your car again, or anything? We're not all psychic! Give us some signs!So yes, it's a spectacular drive, but it is not perfect by any means, and needs a huge amount of improvement!

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The road is two lane and there are restrictions on length of vehicle but it is well worth the drive. With current road construction it took us 90 minutes to drive up to Logan Pass from lake McDonald. The road passes waterfalls, weeping wall and plenty of mountain scenery. If you are going to stop at Logan Pass, start early. We left at 7 am and there was plenty of parking available.","August 26, 2017",One of a Kind Road in America,165,"Missoula, Montana",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This is an excellent tour especially when you ride in the Red Jammer, a bus that takes you and another 12 people through the scenic area of Glacier National Park and to the Sun Road. The driver explains some of the history related to the park and lets you know what you are looking at during the ride. This is a must when you visit Glacier National Park. Do it as soon as you arrive at the park!!!!The Jammer itself is cool. It's a pretty Berry Red color, and very comfortable to ride in. When the top is down, you can stand up to take pictures whenever the bus stops. We even saw a Cinnamon Black Bear along the side of the road during the ride.","August 26, 2017",The Red Jammer takes you there,77,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We ventured out on our first morning in the park and even though we had read about going early, after a long previous day of travel we didn't hop of bed and on our way. Should have. We didn't get to the park and the road until around 10:30 and the crowds were definitely already there. Since summer is the only time the weather will permit road repair and winters wreak havoc on the roads there are also construction delays. However, it was worth the long lines for the views. There was a bit of smoke settling into the valleys and around some of the mountains due to a local wildfire which decreased the clarity of the view. But we were here and couldn't change the smoke, so we enjoyed our drive just the same. ","August 25, 2017",Beautiful views and lots of people looking ,216,Nashville,5

They were doing construction on the road when we were there, but the traffic still wasn't nearly as bad as I would've thought. Plenty of pull off spots to stretch your legs or take some photos. The only place we had trouble parking was at Logan Pass. We drive around that parking lot for 35 minutes before we found a spot. ","August 24, 2017","Spooky, but amazing!!",12,,5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This was our second trip to the Going to the Sun Road and the East Entrance at the St.Mary's Visitors Centre. The Visitors Centre has Bathrooms, a Gift Shop and really knowledgable Rangers. You will need to take your own water, food and bug spray. This year we were able to drive nearly half way along the road from East Glacier (as there was still part of the road closed) in early June. East Entrance is dominated by St. Mary's Lake, which is accessible in places for a paddle or even a dip (if you're brave). Stopping at formal overlooks to see the St. Mary Falls and the Jackson Glacier are amongst the more formal ways to enjoy the drive. We went on short hikes where possible and, so long as you park off the roadway there are any number of opportunities to photograph the spring flowers, lake views or mountain terrain. Entering By late June we were able to drive nearly all the other half by entering through West Glacier at Apgar. There are great food venues just before the entrance,bathrooms and gift shops. There is a great drive around Lake MacDonald with lots of places to stop and get into the water. Further along the MacDonald Waterfalls and others. A walk in the river at Avalanche Creek and a picnic is pleasant with hiking trails nearby, then onto Red Rock Point. There is more traffic during the summer months and parking is at a premium. This place is really magical, unfortunately, we did not get to drive the entire road to Logan Pass, which is different again we are told. Still have the will to get to that part, and sure we will find a way.","August 24, 2017","Where there's a will, there is a way!",81,"Brisbane, Australia",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,Going-to-the-Sun Road is an experience like no other. It's something everyone should undergo at least once in their lifetime. The views are so majestic that you almost feel as if your looking at a painting. There are millions of photo opportunities so don't worry if you can't stop at every scenic pull off along the way. Wear layers (even in the summer heat) because it gets much cooler along the way. Make sure you use the bathroom beforehand because the lines can get long and parking is usually limited. Be aware that you might feel the effects of mild altitude sickness because of high elevation.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I decided to update my review based upon what happened this summer (2017). Parking became such a problem that there were times when they would only allow a car to go into the park when one came out. For some reason the number of visitors to the park has been increasing rapidly for the past two years (over 20% increase each year). There's simply not enough parking spaces for all the cars. Either go very early to the top or better yet the park has free hop on hop off bus service inside the park that you can take. The buses will enable you to hike where you want to hike, including at the summit (a very popular place for hikers). There are also red bus tours that aren't free but look like fun. I'll try them next year. In any event the park is a must do. It's just becoming increasingly difficult to see the park and take a hike in your own car. Allow a day and take the buses to be sure you'll be able to stop at points of interest and hike where you want to hike (Avalanche is my favorite). This recommendation applies to the months of July and August. I'm not sure what happens in June and September. Good luck!!","August 23, 2017",Parking during summer months has become a serious problem,25,Lafayette,5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I drove this road more than 45 years ago and it still is spectacular.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Another reviewer stated that you can't do Glacier without this amazing road. That is definitely a true statement because this is the only road that takes visitors from one side to the other through the park. We drove south around the park, up the east side and took the few roads on the west side and never experienced the traffic and congestion of Going-To-The-Sun Road. We attempted to stop at the Logan Pass Visitor Center and could not get a parking spot. Some people apparently wait an hour for a parking spot to open up. There are shuttles run by the park, but you have to find a parking spot in order to catch a shuttle. This road is probably a lovely drive, but most of the drive I was frustrated with the congestion issue or driving the hairpin turns, amazed that my mirror was not hitting the cliff. Husband claims it was a beautiful drive.I may be biased due to an unfortunate experience while in the Logan Pass Visitor Center parking lot. A car vacated a parking spot; I prepared to pull in, and a lady stood in front of my car, blocking me from entering, while her mate pulled in and parked. We were unable to find a place to park and eventually gave up and drove on. So beware of bears while in Glacier Park, and beware of obnoxious visitors.","August 22, 2017",Not a good experience,99,"Atlanta, Georgia",2

The road is only open from late June to October. It's got plenty of pull offs for sight seeing, and leads to tons of great trails, beautiful lakes, and of course the mighty mountains and glaciers that make this place the Crown of the Continent. If you only have 1 day to spend in the park, this road has to be at the top of your list. I've ridden it once on a motorcycle, which was the great. I've driven it several times now too, and it never gets old. Just a hint though, because the season is so short for this road, it does get busy fast.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We drove this road for 3 days in August 2017 on a Wed, Thursday and Friday. Before going I was concerned that because this is supposedly the busiest time of year for the park that I would be stuck in traffic jams all day long and left with no place to park for the hikes and stops along the way. I will say that I was pleasantly surprised. The only time I had to stop along the way was for the 3 places where there was road construction and they were limiting traffic to just one way but even then I didn't ever wait longer than 5 minutes for our turn to go. The traffic flowed nicely at generally a 30 - 40 Mph clip. It was a beautiful drive. It probably took us just a bit more than 30 minutes to get from West Glacier to Logan pass. We got up early and we were in the park between 7 and 8 each morning. We didn't really have that much problem parking but If you are worried about parking I would get into the park between 7 & 8 and park at the Avalanche parking area and ride the shuttle so that you can enjoy the views. it doesn't take much longer and it really is worth it to not have to drive.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The park is just not designed for the number of people who want to come. We came the second week of August, 2017. We had read that some places on the Going to the Sun Road are narrow so we decided to leave the car at the Apgar Visitor Center and take the shuttle. At Zion and Rocky Mountain everyone had to park and get on bus. This worked fine. We rode the bus and got off where we wanted, then when ready to go to the next place got on the next bus that came along. We thought this would be a good strategy at Glacier. We arrived and parked at Apgar at 8:30 AM ready to get on the first shuttle which began at 9:00. There was already a long line, and we were told there would be a 2 1/2 hour wait till we could get on one. We decided to drive up the road instead. The lower parts of the road are easy driving but higher up it's narrow with a vertical rock wall on one side and a sheer drop off on the other. A line of rectangular stone blocks separates the edge of the road from the drop off. I tried to stay as close as possible to the center yellow line but my wife was screaming ""you're too close to the edge!, you're too close! We got to the top at Logan Pass and wanted to park and get out and walk around. The lot was full with a dozen cars circling the lot waiting for someone to leave. We did that for 10 or 15 minutes and decided to give up and go down. A Park Ranger told us the lot filled at 8:00 AM. There are wider areas at some spots along the road where you can pull off and get out. We did that so we did get to see the areas along the road. It is magnificent, but we were frustrated. We stopped on the way down at the Avalanche Camp site. The small lot there was full also, but we were lucky enough to pull in just as another group pulled out of their spot. We walked along a board walk path through the woods to a waterfall.  The next day we drove up to the Lake McDonald Lodge and parked there. We thought we would get on a shuttle when it stopped and let people off. We arrived early but others were already waiting and when shuttles arrived either no one got off or just a very few.  We probably should have signed up for one of the red bus tours, but we like to do our own thing. They appear to stop to let people out at the various viewing places, but they aren't a drop off, get on the next one tour. The problem is no one's fault and there's no easy solution. The shuttles are small.Full size buses would not fit on the road. They only run every 15 to 30 minutes. The park could buy dozens more, but budgets have been cut and more cuts are proposed in the current national budget. Plus, the season is short, primarily July and August. Coming just after Labor Day could be good, but didn't work for us. Also, one of the park employees told us she remembered snow on Labor Day. Not a big storm and the road closed for just one day, but still that could throw a real monkey wrench in your plans. Maybe the week just before Labor Day when lots of kids start school? Maybe that would have been better. Who knows.","August 18, 2017",The Park is Beautiful So Too Many People Want to Come,17,"Boston, Massachusetts",4

Depending on when you go, you may find it difficult to find a parking space, especially at Avalanche Lake and the Logan Pass visitors center. The full road is only open for two to three months during the summer, the dates varying from year to year depending on snow and road construction. This year I think the dates were June 28 to Sept. 8. If you go during the peak months, I recommend getting an early start. If you go all the way across, you can return via Highway 2, Before the road opens to car traffic in the spring, there is a bikes-only period for the road, which would be wonderful for cyclists.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I had heard about this road and read reviews so I had high expectations. Coming from Calgary where we have the Rockies in our backyard I figured the drive would a scenic, slightly different variation of highway one into Banff, Canmore and Lake Louise. It was so different with sheer cliffside drops with only a rock or small castle-looking edge to keep you from falling what looks like a vertical km at times. As we were driving my friend described it perfectly, ""This is take-your-breath-away scenery"". The drive is not for the faint of heart though! For adrenaline junkies it is fun and windy but if you are afraid of heights at all or driving in tight roads with no shoulder then you definitely need to know what you are in for and be a confident driver! The weather was sunny and clear when we drove but I could see it being nerve-wracking in rain, fog or darkness.

We were a little hesitant after reading earlier reviews about the danger in driving on this road - all for naught. For comparison, both Old Fall River Road and Trail Ridge Road in Rocky Mountain National Park are scarier (and I have no problem with either of them!). I echo the advice to get to the park EARLY! We arrived at the entrance at 6:15 am and, by the time we got to Logan Pass, the lot was filling fast. There were 2 spots where road repair slowed us briefly, but it really wasn't too disruptive.

It is the ONLY road that takes you through the park east/west. We entered the west side of the park a little before 8 am and took our time driving to East Glacier for hiking, when driving back out of the park at 9 pm it was deserted but beautiful as the sun set. The following day we again entered the park early and were leaving around 11:30am and the line to get in was backed up into West Glacier which is nearly 2 miles. Really try to be there around sunset, it makes a beautiful drive even more incredible. I highly recommend the GyPSy Guide App! I think it was about $5, but the best money you'll spend on this trip. The app is GPS based and so you don't need service or wifi for it to work. As you pass various points, it tells about them and options of things to do.

Go late afternoon to avoid some of the congestion and you may even grab a parking spot at Logan Pass. We started at Apgar around 5:00 p.m. and arrived at Logan Pass just after 6:00 p.m. to find a number of open parking spots. It was a perfect time to take a walk through a bit of snow and enjoy watching antics of the many ground squirrels near the visitor center. We took advantage of many scenic turn-outs for late afternoon photos.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I was nervous about driving the road myself (especially with a rental car). I took the Red Bus tour for part of the way to get familiar with it and took a shuttle the second day. After that I gave it a try. It wasn't bad, but you don't want to drive anything that's too wide or long. If you are there when it's busy, go early in the morning and that way you don't run into much oncoming traffic. If you are going downhill (which is mostly going east to west) then you need to put your car in lower gears so you don't burn your brakes out. It is very important that you go very slow especially on the curvier parts of the road. That way you are prepared for bike riders, people not staying in their lane, animals, wider vehicles, or pedestrians. We even saw one really stupid person with a camera and a tripod setting up to take a picture out on the other side of the road. (I hope he didn't cause an accident or get run over. It isn't like there was shoulder or another lane for people to get over. If there were cars coming both ways there would be no where for the oncoming car to go. It wasn't even in a straight section of the road.)

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Parking at Logan Pass was filling up by 7:30 am the days we were there, so we didn't mess around with driving there. We took the free park shuttle service from Apgar. Apgar shuttles provide ""express"" service to Logan from 7:00-7:45, but we encountered quite a wait even at 7:15 am. Didn't leave Apgar until 8:20. Shuttles going to Logan are smaller due to length restrictions; they only carry 12 people, so there can be quite a wait. Once you are down to Avalanche going west, there are larger bus-type shuttles going to Apgar. We were told we were part of record-breaking attendance and shuttle use during our visit. Up 65% from this time last year, so they weren't prepared to handle it well. Employees seemed overwhelmed. We waited at Avalanche for an hour one day as shuttles that pulled through were already full or the smaller type. A transit employee said that park attendance is heaviest on Mondays & Tuesdays and slows down during the rest of the week. He said weekends are actually best as that is when most travelers are transitioning home or to the park, and road construction in the park is not going on (which helps as there are delays due to construction). We drove ourselves from St Mary to Apgar in the evening on a Friday, and there was plenty of parking available at pull-outs. Beautiful views and worth the experience!

For one, this is NOT super intense driving as some have said. There are some curves and you're definitely very high up (which is beautiful and what makes the drive) but there are walls or guardrails on pretty much every high tight turn. There are two full lanes the whole time as well. If you've ever drove on the pacific coast highway in California it's pretty similar to that. It's much easier than the two most intense drives I've done which are the Mt. Evans road outside of Denver and the backside of the road to Hana in Maui. So if you're familiar with those that's where I'd place it. It will take you about two hours total regardless of how you drive. There's plenty of turn-off areas but you'll always run into someone who is going very slow but refuses to turn off. My recommendation is just live with it and don't let it stress you. On the west side of the park we also got stuck behind construction vehicles multiples times. Just enjoy the scenery and don't worry too much about this stuff. Another thing I'd add is that if you want a different beautiful scenic drive which is even easier and MUCH less crowded, we also accidentally took route 2 to route 49 to route 89 on the east side of the park one day on our way from the west side of the park tot he east side and it was stunning as well.","July 28, 2017",Absolutely Beautiful Drive,16,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"A negative review?!? REALLY?!? Yes, really. Hard to believe with all the gushing raves posted, but we had a miserable experience on Going-to-the-Sun Road. It's incredible gorgeous scenery, rivaling any national park, including Yosemite, but c'mon, this emperor has no clothes! We were there on a Monday in July. There were too many people. EVERY time we wanted to stop and enjoy the view/scenery we couldn't, there was nowhere to park, and I mean nowhere. We saw cars parked in the travel lane on what is a VERY NARROW highway (built in 1933 when vehicles were much smaller!). At the visitor's center at the top of the pass, we encountered parking-chaos, a lot that accommodated about 100 vehicles with another 20 or more cruising the lot waiting for a space and more traffic backed up outside the lot waiting to get into the lot to join the cruisers. Thanks to not finding a place to park on the way up, we all wanted to use the restroom at the top, so we tagged-teamed it, with 3 members jumping out while the 4th cruised the lot until another driver finished her business and spelled drive #1 at the wheel to take over the cruising duties while driver #1 did his business. Fun times. And, back to the narrowness of the highway, I kid you not, we lost count of the number of times one of us screamed in terror because an oncoming vehicle CROSSED THE CENTER LINE while we were climbing over the pass. We got some nice photos from the car, and it is indeed a gorgeous place, but we'd never try to cruise through the park in our own car again in the summer months.","July 27, 2017",Whoa! Stop!

This is the best way to see all the scenic beauty the park has to offer. Many people have commented on how scary and risky it is. We just completed it earlier today, and never felt in any sort of danger. It is a two lane, paved road, and there are park appropriate guard rails along higher elevations. Taking US 89 and 2 to the east entrance was far more daring than this park's main thoroughfare. If you are too nervous about driving it, the park offers buses that will take you over the road.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We went to the park today. The views would have been great but for a heavy haze of smoke blown in from BC. We arrived at Apgar Visitor center and were lucky to find a parking space. It was about 8:45 AM. I went in to ask about the free shuttle buses to Logon Pass vs. driving ourselves. The woman at the desk just would not give an answer to my questions regarding the waits on the buses if you get off for a hike or at the transfer location at Avalanche. We opted to wait for the bus, since she did finally say that getting a parking spot at Logan pass could be near impossible.We waited in line for a bus for the better part of 2 hours!!! It wouldn't have been so bad but there were the smaller buses coming in and going out empty!!! Those are the buses you take from Avalanche to the top of the pass. Why the empty buses were not taking people up the hill is a mystery. The wait at the mandatory transfer site at Avalanche was only 10 minutes. We heard about people waiting along the route for hours to catch the bus, since they stopped to hike along the way. Finally we made it to Logan Pass. Yes the view is awesome, but with the heavy haze and after waiting sooooo long I was disappointed. My concern while walking around up there was how long it would take to catch a bus back down.As it turned out, it was no problem getting down and one bus took us the whole way.....which was a huge relief.Bottom line: underwhelming due to the waiting for the bus and the large crowds. When I go to a park I want to feel something special and I just did not get that at Glacier on this visit.If you are coming to Glacier then go into the park very early and be in the park by 7-8 AM. Drive yourself and forsake the buses, so you can stop on the way and enjoy it more. The way the buses were being used was a crime against common sense and a person's peace of mind.

Keep in mind this drive will take you about 2 hours total I would say, especially if you pull off to the look out areas. There are parts of the road that are narrow, and parts of the road may be right on a large drop off, so keep that in mind if you are afraid of heights. Most areas have guardrails as well. The road was in great condition while we were there in July, and snow free – the road is only open during the summer when plowing is completed. Great areas with pull offs to some great views!

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We all agree this is our favorite park EVER. There are just not words to describe how beautifully impressive this park is. We started at Apgar and drove Going to the Sun Road and exited the park at St. Mary. First let me mention the gift shops/visitor centers in the park. It was pretty disappointing. The one at Apgar was a small, crowded room, not able to handle the number of people that visit and of course long lines. We were there on a moderately busy day but I can’t imagine what it must be like on a busy day. Maybe this is why their store seemed not so great. We visit a lot of parks and enjoy shopping in the stores but this left a lot to be desired. Here is a tip for you. Stamp your passport book and buy your stickers BUT get your souvenirs in Apgar Village, just around the corner. We had planned to get sweatshirts but the selection was slim to none and quality was poor and price was ridiculous. There are beautiful gift shops in town and you will be happier. Logan’s Pass Visitor Center had a few more selections, but it was still a crowded mess. St. Mary Visitor Center had a couple of different things, but was the smallest one yet. A park as impressive as Glacier should have shops and merchandise at least as nice as every other park we have visited and they certainly should be large enough to handle the crowds they get each year. NOW. Here is something to consider! We were there on June 30, 2017, we didn’t find out until we had gone through the park that Going to the Sun Road had just opened June 28th!!! We didn’t even consider that the park might not be open by the end of June and would have been sick to drive the whole way there only to find it closed. So please check this before you leave home! The park was busy but we were able to drive the whole way and found parking wherever we wanted it. This has to be the most beautiful park in America. If you have never visited, you must and you will be absolutely amazed. The drive is spectacular. It is stunning.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I've been to quite a few national parks and they all have their beauty and unique characteristics. The Going to the Sun Road in Glacier gives you views that are truly stunning, but many national parks do that. The Road reaches its peak at Logan Pass and the Continental Divide, the geographic line that separates water flowing into the Pacific from water flowing into the Atlantic Ocean and makes Glacier one of a kind. We rode in antique red cars called Jammers and were able to actually see (and not turn away from) precipitous drops from snowy peaks to valleys of unending evergreens, an unforgettable sight...so glad I wasn't driving. The Road had opened for the season just two days before our visit. One suggestion: try to get to the Logan Pass parking lot early as it gets uncomfortably crowded and parking becomes scarce. But the Going to the Sun Road traverses one beautiful stretch of landscape you will not easily forget.","July 15, 2017",Unsurpassed Views and a Geographic Wonder,29,"Phoenix, Arizona",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,The views are spectacular. There is an audio tour to download before you go. Be sure to stop and do overlooks and pullouts along the way.

There were times the early morning sun rising in the east put some glare on the views, but I am glad we went early and avoided some of the traffic. Make sure you have a really good driver because you get very close to the rock wall going up and the edge on the way down. There are always less than competent drivers not paying enough attention to the road or going too fast who can make it a little scary. A must if you are in the area.

The parking at Logan Pass fills up early, but having a handicapped parking sticker was very beneficial here. The visitor center is a nice center, with great souvenirs. The park rangers were very friendly and helpful. Just remember to be respectful of others, driving speeds, and maintain patience. It is a great road with incredible views and many many opportunities to make stops and look a little closer. Take the time to enjoy the whole drive.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We drove this road twice: west to east on the 4th of July and then east to west on the 9th. What everyone says is 100% true: this drive is breathtakingly beautiful and unlike any in America. I've done coastal drives and plenty of other park drives, and this one blew the others out of the water. The reason I think west to east is best is because I think...(1) It's more dramatic because the views get better and better. The portion by Lake McDonald, while still very pretty, isn't as awe-inspiring as the portion near St. Mary. (2) There are more easily accessible pull-offs when you're driving west to east. (3) You're hugging the edge of the cliffs mostly when going west to east so there are no cars in your pictures or videos if you're snapping from the passenger seat. The drive, while straight through would only take you maybe 2 hours, took us from 9 AM until 5:30 PM because we stopped so much to take pics, explore, and just sit in awe of the views.

There are a lot of people here. And most are great, but if you're not into large crowds or driving behind a car that's going 5 mph on a 30, stay away! I'm no speed demon by any means, but some cars go 5-10mph with a camera out the window taping everything and don't pull over when the line of traffic is long behind them. There was a goat on the side of the road today- yes, a goat- and every single car on both sides had to stop in the middle of the road and take a picture. 20 minutes later I finally got by.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"When we stayed here on our recent holiday I so much wanted to drive this. However, when we arrived at our accommodation we discovered that Montana had had its worst winter for years and there was a 100ft high bank of snow in the centre of the Going to the Sun Road which meant that it was closed from just a few miles up from lake McDonald to the other side of the visitor centre. The road was supposed to have been open all the way at least 3 weeks before we arrived here but because of the risk of avalanche rangers had sealed off the centre for safety reasons. Anyone therefore visiting the east side of the park had a two hour drive to get to St Mary's.Anyway what we saw on the glacier was wonderful. We did the drive to St Mary's and drove up as far as we could from the other side to one of the glaciers, which was about 5 miles south of the visitor centre. During the drive from St Mary's we saw an elusive Coyote and a Brown Bear with her three cubs, which was a beautiful site on its own. We also saw some beautiful scenery on the drive there and on the way up the going to the sun road.I will be back and might tackle this from the Canadian side next time. You just can't predict the weather 9 months in advance so we could cope with the disappointment of not seeing the hidden lake or Logan Pass and all the other activities there.","July 11, 2017",I can deal with the disappointment,248,"Worcester, United Kingdom",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"When we made our lodge reservations for Glacier Park there was a suggestion to book a Red Bus Tour for the Going to the Sun Road. I'm so glad I took the suggestion. This road was built from 1926 - 1932 and covers over 50 miles, crossing the Continental Divide. It is very narrow in places, and has sharp turns and steep drop offs. There is a lot of traffic on it. Being on a Red Bus Tour allowed me to experience the beauty of the scenery without having to worry about traffic at all. Our driver, called a Jammer, was Paul. For 9 hours Paul kept our group entertained and informed about the history of the road, the park and local folklore. We stopped many times for photo opportunities, and had a half hour at Logan Pass to walk around. Thanks to Red Bus Tours, and Paul, I had an enjoyable time seeing some beautiful sights without any stress of having to maneuver the road myself. Highly recommend.","July 11, 2017",Use the Red Bus Tour,1,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",5

Big horn sheep at Logan's Pass but they were moving too fast to take good pictures or enjoy very long. Mountains goats were on the slopes and seen with binoculars.

From the East side, you see amazing sights even while driving. From the West side, once we could not drive anymore, we got out and hiked another four miles in. It was so well worth it!! Hiking was better than driving. There would be so much missed while driving. All in all, we missed about 10 miles of Going-to-the-Sun Road, but we were not disappointed. Everything everyone says is true. You can take all the pictures you want, but they just don't compare to the magnificence and beauty of what we saw while on this road.

And a big, fat thumbs down to the Montana person behind us at the gate, who kept honking because the Saskatchewan truck ahead of us, was taking too long. It was July 4th and they were so rude, I eventually got out and told them to stop honking. They also drove like lunatics, which is pretty disconcerting on those roads and speeding is NEVER acceptable. It is pretty and driving the road is one of those things everyone should do - once - and that's enough. Lots of pull offs which is great!

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"If you're only going to do one thing in the area, this should be it. As long as you enjoy beautiful natural scenery, and aren't too afraid of heights, you're going to have a great time. This is also your best bet to see mountain goats and/or big horned sheep. I've lived in the area for almost ten years and make a point of going at least once a summer. My best tips:- Ideally you should have two good drivers in your party, one to drive over, and one to drive back. The road is narrow, twisty, and WILL require all of your attention to navigate, leaving you little time to appreciate the view. If you don't have two good drivers, take the shuttle or book a tour on one of the red jammers.- The season is very, very short and can be extremely busy. The road frequently doesn't open until after the 4th of July. Leave EARLY for your drive. There's nothing more disappointing than getting to the pass, and not being able to find parking.- The majority of people drive up to the pass, turn around, and go back down; but they're really missing out!

Slow speed, a zillion tight turns, zero shoulders, no chance to enjoy the view because of oncoming traffic, following traffic, and the need to pay attention for every second of the drive.

The Road is beautifully maintained and while some pull-outs and parking areas were full, the majority were not - and this was on a major holiday. Logan Pass required about a 10 minute wait for parking. We arrived at the Rising Sun Motor Inn invigorated by our experience. On July 4, we drove the rode BACK to West Glacier early in the morning (we left Rising Sun at 7am) for whitewater rafting and reveled in the fact that driving back the opposite direction made the entire drive a brand new experience - like seeing a totally different park. After our rafting, we drove AGAIN back to Rising Sun In the mid afternoon and stopped at some of the places we had missed before. We actually then left REALLY early on July 5 specifically for Logan Pass, parking was easy, and the hike to Hidden Lake Overlook over the still-standing snow was a true highlight!

This was by far the best views we had of the glaciers and numerous waterfalls along the Going to the Sun Road of all our travels through GNP. I highly recommend doing this drive with plenty of time for photo stops!,"June 29, 2017",Amazing Drive!,431,"Rockledge, Florida",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,We were very fortunate that Going to the Sun Road opened up the day we arrived which was June 28th. The views along this 50 mile stretch of road are absolutely stunning! Keep in mind that it goes very slowly and can get quite congested. Take your time and plan to spend a few hours as there are multiple stops along the way and an abundance of photo ops!!!,"June 28, 2017","Amazing drive, but takes a while!",312,"Fort Myers, Florida",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,I truly believe that this is one of the drives that every American should do in their lifetime. The road just opened today after being closed for the season so it was very busy. Just make sure you take advantage of all of the turnouts for amazing photo ops. ,"June 28, 2017",Outstanding ,40,,5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Nice road the main road through the park. You can't stop unless there is a turnout but there are quite a few of those especially where there are views. However these can become very crowded. Even though the road was busy you could still keep moving fairly well. Often closed, we went all the way through on 28 June which was the first day it was open.","June 28, 2017",Main road through park,14,"Aberdeen, Idaho",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Let me start by saying the middle part of the road was closed, so we didn't even get to see the entire thing. However, the fifteen miles we were able to drive from St. Mary's were incredible. It was cold, drizzly, and very windy, but that didn't matter. I probably took 100 photos in those 15 miles, and that still failed to capture the beauty.Also, as we were driving back to the entrance, a mother bear and three cubs crossed the road in front of us. Amazing.","June 28, 2017",A top five drive for me,11,"Burlington, North Carolina",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"So, 15 miles of this road was still closed in mid-late June for us, so we feel that we really missed out!!! Logan pass wasn't accessible and neither was Hidden Lake. We must go back! The parts we did see were beautiful from the EAST part (St. Mary's entrance). The West entrance up until Avalanche (then the road was closed) was nothing to brag about. Im guessing the 15 miles of closed road are the best views ever. There is VERY little parking for the trails, so if you see one- grab it ASAP!","June 28, 2017","Breathtaking, but not always open!",51,"Andover, Minnesota",4

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Part of the road was still closed in early June 2017. But we drove up as far as we could and made plenty of stops along the way and then back. The rivers and mountains and trails and flowers... they are all just extraordinarily beautiful. We hiked for a bit, sit for a bit, went to the lake Lodge for a bit, and just enjoyed this wonderful drive through Glacier NP.

We were just there last week and the Going-to-the-Sun-Road was blocked off for vehicles at Avalanche Trail (due to snow still being on the road further up) so we had to hike 8 miles up to ""the loop"". WOW... so glad we were able to walk rather than drive. I can't even explain how amazingly beautiful that journey was... Just so picturesque!!! Of course we took a million pictures... but photos just don't do the beauty of this place justice... please do yourself a favor... AND GO!!!

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I've driven the Going To The Sun Road many times over the years. Many places are narrow, and one wants to drive carefully. The edge of the road is steep and a long ways to the bottom. Scenery is breath taking, and if you look closely, you'll spot wildlife.Mountain Goats can be seen near the top, and a few were so close that you could pet them. A female goat with her baby followed us on a narrow trail and looked at us curiously. They didn't act scared, but would walk away if we approached them. To go to Glacier Park and not drive to Logan Pass is robbing yourself of nature's beauty at it's finest.","June 18, 2017",Not for the faint hearted driver.,7,"Helena, Montana",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"A fantastic trip that any adventurer would enjoy. The scenery is spectacular with nothing but nature in your surroundings. The Going-to-the-Sun Road was only open to vehicle traffic partway as the plows are still removing snow from a hard winter, however, one can bike or even walk past the roadblocks. In fact, our biking past the roadblocks allowed us to see one bear and several deer in the far distance. It also made the place more serene and peaceful as no vehicles were allowed. This is one of the most beautiful places in the world.","June 16, 2017",Fantastic Adventure ,123,"Clearwater, Florida",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Road is not completely open due to snow. You can drive about 14 miles to Avalanche from West Glacier. It was a pleasant drive with several pull outs, the Lodge, places to eat and shop. Watch out for bicyclists. They are all over this road. There is little opportunity to pass as you have many bends in the road and can't see around the corner.Unfortunately the red bus tours were still charging full price $42 for the ride halfway through the park. That honestly can't be worth it. We drove and enjoyed our self paced stops. ","June 11, 2017",Not too Crowded,162,"Helotes, Texas",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"It is a beautiful drive, be sure and pull over and look at attractions when possible, there are hidden surprises. It can be slow going with traffic, but it is worth the drive. Parking can be hard to find at the lodges and at popular trails. Beautiful views....Drive it both ways to see different views. Be on the lookout for animals. They have several trails that you can walk, some short, others take days, bring your water and hiking boots.","June 11, 2017",Absolutely Beautiful......,44,"Broken Arrow, Oklahoma",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,This road is awesome but better when it is fully open. You need to wait until July for the opening. They have upwards of 80' of snow to clear until then. So plan your trip after the fourt is my recommendation. ,"June 9, 2017",Not open in early June,11,,2
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This is the best way to tour the park, but leave early and don't plan too much in any one day or you'll miss the beauty and power of the sites you see. Always have snacks/water because you can often end up exploring trails longer than expected and places to eat are very few and far between. If going to East Glacier, it might be easier to go around the south route to avoid traffic. Parking is difficult but no impossible and there can be long waits for trams. We stayed in Kalispell and really loved the town.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Going to the sun road cuts through the glacier national park. It's one of the most gorgeous drives you'll ever make. However, if you don't keep in mind the time of year like we did, you'll miss part or all of it. We went on the long weekend in May and found out that on about half of it, the snow hadn't been cleared. It was closed for public use. Especially cars. However, there's a lesser known but fantastic tradition of biking all the way up to the snow ploughs and back. After the first five miles, it's a 6% uphill climb. I bet you'll thoroughly enjoy the ride back down. And the views on the way, my oh my, the views! They'll take away part of your pain for sure. You can easily rent mountain bikes at the Apgar village outfitters. Another great option is Glaicer in White Fish. Definitely do not miss this biking or driving. I've also heard that when it IS open, it's got great trail heads up starting at the Lake McDonald lodge.Do not miss this!","June 7, 2017",Gorgeous Bike Route in Late Spring,17,,5

We drove 15 miles west to east, then another day drove the long way around to do the 15 miles east to west. Then another day we biked the west road past where vehicles had to turn around, about 6 or 7 miles (one way).

Going-to-the-Sun Road,A memorable experience is to bike the Going to the Sun road in Glacier Park before the road opens to traffic at the end of June or early July. The scenery is so beautiful ....lots of snow still on the mountains...the rivers are flowing at full speed and waterfalls can be viewed in every direction. We carried bear spray but didn't see any...still important to be prepared. We road from Avalanche to the Loop...round trip was 16 miles. Going up is a challenge at times but go at your own speed and stop and take lots of pictures. You won't regret the experience...all ages can enjoy this.

On our first day we drove up to the sharp bend and decided to stop there and turn back since we had ""plenty"" of time to explore during the week. The next day we decided to go further and the road had closed for the winter. The drive was amazing, but we couldn't see much of the landscape due to the weather.

My 5 key reasons to go:1. crashing waterfalls next to the road.2. river rapids at the bottom.3. snow at the top.4. wildlife.5. absolutely picturesque views.The pictures I took have been some of my favourite and required absolutely no editing or filters. You will love the drive and thank yourself for going. I went on a beautiful sunny day after white water rafting. The tourists drive a bit insane (distracted by the views) so be careful on the twists and bends. Plenty of places to pull over on the way and take pictures.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"First, be aware you cannot drive a big RV or a trailer on this road. The restrictions make sense, since space is limited, the road never very wide, and turn outs are rare. It was built in the 30s. That said, this is a very memorable drive, and don't rush it. This is driving on top of the world for a good part of the way. Get your passenger to take the photos while you tend to the driving. You get maybe 5 spots to stop and pull off before the pass. I'd love to drive this one again almost anytime (in summer).

It is not nearly as scary as some people expect. There are road-edge walls and safety barriers all the way and many places to turn off. The Alpine, drop-off Section is really not very long...about 3.5 miles up from the Loop to Logan Pass Summit. Traveling from west to east to Logan Summit you are on the outer lane.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I had to be in Many Glacier early one September morning, so I took the Going-To-The-Sun Road from West Glacier to St. Mary in the wee hours. I stopped at one of the turnouts somewhere around the Garden Wall, and turned off my vehicle. A full moon lit up the Garden Wall behind me and everything as far as I could see - from the hairpin corner west of Logan Pass back over towards Lake McDonald. All I could hear was water cascading down the mountain sides. What an experience.If you like stargazing, there might be more of those astronomy sessions at Logan Pass this year. The times and details I think are published in the ‘Ranger-Led’ monthly pdf guides that come out during the summer. Maybe the visitor centers at Apgar or St. Mary have some information. The astronomy club that puts on those events with the Park Service is Big Sky Astronomy Club of Kalispell (do a search, I think it’s bigskyastroclub.org).

We considered taking the red bus, but was encouraged to drive ourselves.*** That was great advice. I'm never the driver on these mountain roads, so it was just getting over passenger nerves. Can't truthfully say there weren't a few scary moments, but they were brief and totally worth it. These are a few hints for the timid: Driving from St. Mary toward Lake McDonald...the car is on the inside against the mountain. Good to know. When driving from Lake McDonald to St. Mary...g et in the backseat behind the driver. You'll still be able to see things, but you won't feel like you're going over the edge. Close your eyes if you need to, but you'll probably want to peek. There are plenty of pull-outs where you will feel more secure and will be able to take all the photos you want.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"It doesn't seem possible that you could come all this way to Glacier National Park and not tour Going-to-the Sun Road. This road, constructed 1921-1932, is one of our nation's most impressive engineering feats. The pioneering use of landscape architecture skills helped reduce switchbacks and enhance views. It crosses the Continental Divide at Logan's Pass.The road is two lanes and narrow. There are many hairpins. There are few guard rails or stone walls, because annual avalanches take them out. There are some, but few, places to stop. Turn around at Logan's Pass or keep going down the other slope (white knuckles?). Logan's Pass good news: visitor center with restrooms and exhibits. Bad news: not enough parking spaces. This is why it is highly recommended that you take a bus tour. Otherwise your eyes will be on the roadbed and your palms sweaty on the steering wheel.

You can't take a large vehicle such as a motor home on the road. You must take the tour bus. That may be easier because the visitors' center at Logan Pass doesn't have enough parking. It would be wise to travel the road right after it opens in the summer. Opening the road with snowplows is a gigantic task. It is narrow, winding, and high.

Taking the shuttle is recommended anyway because it reduces congestion on the road and in parking lots and allows you to enjoy the views, which are spectacular. The shuttles are divided into east and west and meet in the middle at Logan Pass and did I mention, free. The parking lot was very congested at Logan Pass.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Yes the road is/was an engineering marvel getting over that mountain and is very pretty, saw a mountain goat and baby right along road near summit. The only issue( in my opinion) is that it gets so crowded and it's near impossible to find a parking spot at the summit visitors center. We drove around for 10 minutes unsuccessfully. I would have liked to hike the boardwalk to see some Glaciers and lakes but could not park.To be fair we also drove the Icefields parkway and Beartooth ""highway"", each have their unique flavor. Compared to the Icefields( which was our favorite) you cannot see much of remaining glaciers from the road so you have to be an avid hiker to get to the goods whereas you can see tons of glaciers from the Icefields road and it's plentiful stop offs.Going up to Lethbridge Alberta for my nephews wedding was our ticket for this trip of a lifetime. I would recommend going over the ""chief"" highway shortcut to the Canadian part of Glacier (Waterton) and taking the schooner boat ride between the country's on the 1927 boat. We saw an eagle and a lynx trying to swim across the lake.Yes going to the sun ""highway""(25mph) is well worth the drive after driving up past gorgeous Flathead Lake from Missoula and as a skier the gondola ride up Big mtn( Whitefish lake resort) was a highlight.I should give it five stars and I suppose it's not the national parks fault it's crowded but I wouldn't need to drive it again( my wife is scared stiff of the drop offs/ cliffs) but I would return to the Icefields parkway and Canadian Rockies in a heartbeat.Just the same I highly recommend taking the drive, just don't go on a beautiful Friday afternoon in the middle of August, I suppose it's busy every day of the week all summer long.","February 7, 2017","Slow, crowded, but Gorgeous just the same",106,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",4

The clouds started to break up once we reached higher elevations, and we were left with incredible, foggy views of the park, similar to what I've seen in the Smoky Mountains (but with much more impressive mountains).After a day of hiking, we made our way back across the park. The views were incredible and the wildlife was in full-swing. We saw mountain goats, rams, and even a black bear with two cubs in tow. The traffic wasn't bad, and it didn't bother us either way as we were in no rush to get through.If you have the time, I definitely recommend making at least one pass through, but preferably two. It's an incredible way to get a look at the park.","February 2, 2017",All the Way and Back,12,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,We did this in August 2016. We originally planned on driving the road but after reading about all the twists and turns in the road decided to take the shuttle. We were happy with this decision. There were 4 of us and we could all enjoy the scenery. We went early to catch the first shuttle and took it to the trail to Hidden Lake. After our hike we got back on and went on to the east entrance before taking a shuttle back. This worked out well for us.

There wasn't a moment driving through the Going to the Sun Road that wasn't unbelievably beautiful. Once you exit the park on the east side the mountains are done. We went through way faster than I would've liked to. (3-4 hours) I am definitely going back this summer to spend AT LEAST 2 nights, 3 days (minimum).

I got many fantastic photos with wild flowers and majestic mountains. If you are driving this road twice (to enter and exit at the same entrance), I recommend to stop at every scenic stop the first time you drive it as it will be difficult to remember what you have covered already.","January 9, 2017",Photo spot every minute,35,"Saratoga, California",5

Also, the driver could concentrate on driving as we had seen the sites the day before on our tour. Upon leaving (east side), there are not very many restaurants/gas options. There is a grocery store immediately upon leaving Glacier - recommend getting food/sandwiches there.

We made three trips in total, one of them across the entire length of GTTSR.The mountains are beautiful, and the road itself is an engineering gem. Each turn brings new joys.In late June, we had wet snowfall at Logan Pass (it was COLD!) We saw several grizzlies, including a mother and cub (from a safe distance of a thousand yards...)I agree with others - get an early start because things get busy. Note the vehicle length restriction (21 feet). Visit the GNP website for details.It was a long drive from Yellowstone but Glacier NP is worth it!Bonus 1: consider the America The Beautiful pass if you are visiting more than a couple National Parks with entrance fees. For us, it paid for itself after Yellowstone and Glacier, but we visited 9 parks in our trip.Bonus 2: for the younger kids, definitely look into the Junior Ranger program. Stop by a ranger station when you first arrive at the park; the kids learn a lot and it gives them a goal to achieve (a cool badge...)","December 31, 2016",One of the top highlights of our 6000+ mile trip,17,"Atlanta, Georgia",5

Very much enjoyed Jackson Glacier overlook (easiest view of a Glacier without a big hike or longer drive) on the E side.At the pass, the parking lot gets full EARLY - if you have a large group and a patient driver, it may be easier to unload at the pass and have the driver wait a set amount of time at the first parking area to the east - Lunch Creek - and them come back for you (worked for us!). You could use the park shuttle or a paid tour instead of driving yourself.Lovely views, amazing engineering, and helpful interpretive signs galore.In summer 2016 there was plenty of road work, with some waits on 1-way sections - one of the few places anywhere that getting stopped was a benefit!

There aren't enough parking spaces to accommodate the traffic and there aren't parking spaces on the road nearby. So, you may not be able to visit the ranger station or take the hikes at the top.

When we woke up, the weather was starting to clear - it was beautiful (this wasn't just a dream, by the way - we were awake and not just imagining the place in good weather). The drive gets better & better - superb peaks and valleys. Being restricted on time by the weather, we opted for one of the short hikes, choosing Hidden Lake. Only short, very easy.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This is a really long road that snakes through the park and a great way to see everything (by car). I was super impressed as this was my first time to the park. We had rented a car with 4x4, but normal cars can make this stretch, it wasn't treacherous at all.My mother-in-law is disabled so I'm always on the look out for things she could do, and this is definitely one of them! One of the other reviews I had read recommended the GyPSy ""Going to the Sun Rd"" App (available in app store) which was very cool. There is a lot of history in the building of this road and in some of the things that have happened in the park. The app has GPS and will play audio while you drive along the road and it points out things to see and interesting facts. If we didn't have the app, we would have missed the McDonald Falls because it wasn't marked from the road. It tells you, coming up ahead, look for a parking space and go see the falls. Stuff like that. The app is $5 and pays for itself (in my opinion). It works while you are offline and is about a 100mb download. The park also has some podcasts that you can download and listen to on your way. I didn't know this until we were almost done driving the road. Just do an internet search for ""Glacier National Park podcasts"" and look for the ones from the nps (national park service) website. The park headquarters has WIFI if you need to download them while you are at the park.One other app that I found particularly helpful is the ""REI national parks guide and maps"" app. It has a listing of all of the trails along with maps and difficulty level, approx time it takes to hike them, how to get to the trail head, etc. I used it to plan my trip, which trails I wanted to hike and it works offline (I was in airplane mode looking at it from the plane!).So, aside from all of the gadgets you can use while in the park (we had no phone signals), this road is your main method of getting to some of the trail heads. We ended up hiking to Avalanche lake by way of the Cedars trail. (Cedars trail is definitely wheel chair friendly too!). Avalanche Lake trail is beautiful and goes all the way to this glacial lake. Gorgeous.We were there in early October and there was a ton of fall color. It was raining and chilly (50s) but the park was mostly empty. I could see how this place would be packed in the summer. One of the disappointing things was that some of the park closes on September 30th. There's the McDonald Lodge - it closes on Sept 30th. The Going to the Sun Road was also closed for several miles (due to snow and ice), so we had to turn around right after the weeping wall. The park website has a listing of the road closures, which would be good to know before you go. They provided a safe place for us to turn around.","October 19, 2016","Enjoyable drive, suitable for all ages",234,"Austin, TX",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Back in the day when America's National Parks were being opened up there were engineers and visionaries that opened these natural spaces for the rest of us. The roadmakers deserve incredible credit for both designing and then constructing these roads.There is absolutely no way that we would permit anyone to work in the kinds of conditions that these men worked in, climbing sheer rock faces, carrying all their tools on ropes, in all kinds of weather, working by hand and foot. All for a road in a park.There are other examples in other Parks, of the kind of dedication and skill required to build such roads. If you want to understand the origins of America, and what it has meant to be American, take a look at this road, and others like it, and marvel at how seemingly crackpot ideas can be transformed into true wonders of skill and enjoyment.We drove this road a number of times. Once in the beautiful red buses. Do it often. Do it at dawn or dusk. Catch the shadows and contrast at those times. Do it slowly. Stop everywhere and take a look.The name comes from the native American Indians, the first people, who knew that when we die, we travel up the Going to the Sun Peak (near Logan Pass) and thence to live with the gods. Remember that when you drive it. it's hard to think of a more glorious ascent than this one. And, finally, do it in fall. The road is not empty but it is easy at this time of the year. The colours are magnificent, the mountains awesome. Basically, you all need to do it.","October 18, 2016","Stunning road, stunning views, do it more than once",98,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",5

Good thing my husband didn't mind driving, I probably would have had some issues. It's a loooong way down and some areas don't have guardrails(due to the avalanches wiping them out) which makes me nervous. If you go east to west you are on the 'inside'. Length of time depends upon how many photo-ops you stop for or hikes you take. Don't expect to whiz thru here, even if you're comfortable most people go slow to look(or out of fear) and there is rarely anywhere to pass.

Don't think the shuttle busses are frequent enough to be an efficient way to use your time . This park definitely needs to move to Zion's bus only system which runs non-stop much more efficiently.

The road is a must if you want to see Glacier NP and it gets a little tight in some places (lots of curves). You have to keep your eye on the road because drivers don't follow the speed limit and are always coming into your lane. We stopped as much as we could to take photos and just absorb the beauty of this park. Because of all the stopping, it took us about 6-7 hours to drive from the west to east entrance and back again.

There is a lot of parking there, but we were never able to find an open spot the couple times we were in the area. We drove this road from East to West and didn't have much traffic.

I've read people complaining about traffic and difficulty finding parking but I did not have any of those issues. The day I visited Logan Pass was very windy and cold so I could not hike as much as I would have liked. Bottom line, the park is beautiful but it left something to be desired because of how far I drove to see it. Had I flown to Montana, I probably could have appreciated it more.

We couldn't get tickets for the red bus tour, so we decided to just do the drive ourselves. So many people said how dangerous the road was, but we did not find that to be true. We were in a Toyota Rav4 and had no trouble at all. There are plenty of pullouts to use and enjoy the scenery and photo opportunities. The Logan's Pass visitors center is a great place to stop and enjoy a picnic lunch and a gorgeous hike up to Hidden Lake.","October 7, 2016","Great Drive, have your camera ready!",55,"Santa Fe, New Mexico",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,We were at Glacier for 2 days in early September. There was a snow storm in the mid section of the road so we only made it half way the first day. We didn't want to miss East Glacier the second day so we actually drove AROUND the park to the other side. Thankfully after a couple hours the entire Going to the Sun road opened and we were able to take it back to the Westside. The views were STUNNING. I enjoyed both sides but really thought the eastside showed a little better while we were there because of the lighting and wildlife.

One side of the road is cut into rock--no shoulder--we stopped and pulled in our rear-view mirrors so that we wouldn't hit a passing truck's mirrors. Yes, that's about how close you may come to the other cars/trucks in the other lane. But it is NOT frightening, just be careful and plan your time.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"It's of course, the main reason for going to Glacier NP, i.e. to see what's on the other side. There was some construction but it was handled professionally and caused us little delay. We went in early September of this year and were able to use the turn outs on almost every one of the major stops for pictures. Only had to turn around once to find a spot at the parking area for St. Mary's Falls. I would absolutely hate to be there in the middle of the height of the tourist season and have to ""battle"" to find a parking spot. Once you've passed it, there is no turning back. There is no place to turn around. Getting up early is the answer and to spend enough time to see all that you want to see. We spent five days there and it was NOT enough. John Muir told us to spend 30 and to see the park as it should be seen, I believe him. Glacier NP is hard enough to get to, so if you only plan to see it once in your lifetime, spend that month and do it , and yourself, justice. I'm 73 and trying to visit them all. So, I can't go back.

There are many waterfalls right off the road. Be sure to take advantage of the pull outs for scenery and to let other vehicles by. There are some crazy drivers that want to speed by.

The road is about 50 miles long and will take most of a day driving if you stop and really enjoy the scenery.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We live near the Blue Ridge Parkway which was also built by the CCC many years ago. Driving through Glacier National Park on Going To The Sun Road is an experience of a lifetime! The road is well-designed, with gorgeous views, one more beautiful than the next! It is well-built and maintained. It is safe. It is amazing to consider its construction. It is truly the prettiest drive in the USA, regardless of the weather. We recently visited when snow fell at the peak of the mountains, shutting down the road in the middle at Logan's Pass, for a few days. Fortunately we made it through before the snow started accumulating and were able to drive all the way from the west to the eastern side of park on GTTS road. Initially I was delighted to see a dusting of snow lingering on the mountain tops. But after driving south around the entire park to see the sites on the other side, because of the road closure, I realized how much I missed that beautiful drive! Fortunately the snow melted enough to open the road back up before we returned home and we were able to experience sunsets along the road a few more times. It was one of the highlights of our week in GNP. Don't miss it!","September 28, 2016",The most beautiful road in all the world,22,"Simpsonville, South Carolina",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Our visit to Glacier National Park (GNP) was to last a few days, and we wanted to start it by navigating the Going to the Sun Highway as the road was on our “bucket lists.” It’s imperative to listen to the weather reports, we did, and learned that rain with snow above 6,000 ft. was expected for Sunday, September 11th. At the entrance to GNP it was raining, the Park Ranger told us the road was open and to try to get to Logan’s pass before 10 am to beat the crowds; good to know and a must if you want to get a parking space to hike any of the trails. By the time we reached Logan’s pass we were in the clouds/fog and the temperature was falling to 35 degrees F., rain mixed with sleet was falling. This road is not for a timid driver; the most rigorous portion to drive is from the West entrance to Logan’s pass, with the steepness of the road and the drop offs decreasing towards the East entrance. A driver must focus on the road and any oncoming drivers, in some areas there is no room for error. Your car will either be against the rock of a mountain, or, on the side with a significant drop off/cliff. There are numerous pull-offs to stop and take pictures, these stops allow your driver to enjoy the scenery. The views are incredible! Be extremely careful to stay behind the rudimentary rock guard rails, dodge the other people taking photos, and mind the people who park across the street and run out in front of passing cars.Again, pay attention to the weather. This road was closed by the time we reached the East park entrance. It was closed for at least two days with snow at Logan’s Pass, and did not fully open again until Wednesday, September 14th. We drove from East to West again on Wednesday, September 14th to get a sunny view of Logan’s pass, and it did not disappoint. Gorgeous!

Along the drive on this road, we saw numerous waterfalls cascading furiously down the mountains.

The tours book early (like pre-book- they were full when we tried to book one) so on that front we were out of luck.However- we did get lucky... the road closed due to snow. We saw a bit of the west side- which still had lots of people, but the snow I think deterred many travelers I think from going around to the east side. So, the next day we traveled up the east side to Logan Pass, stopping along the way to see many things that would likely have been WAY harder to see if the road was open.

There are areas for larger vehicles to pull over to get out of the way BUT as it was explained to us, is that if they do and they stop it is so very hard to get going again.

If for no other reason than the 25 remaining glaciers (out of 150) are expected to be gone in less than 15 years. The road takes you through some of the most beautiful and diverse country in the country if not the world. Keep in mind there is little to no cell phone service (you might get lucky if you have Verizon) but we did have an app that we downloaded before the trip that was awesome. It was called Gypsy Guide-Going to the Sun Roads Gypsy Tour. Navigates you through all of the points of interest before you get to them and tells you history about the area. I had no cell phone service but it still worked. If you start out near the St. Mary's visitor center, there is free wi-fi there and I was able to make a skype call to get in touch with family.

There were vistas, along this road, that will occupy your ""vacation memories"" for months and years to come!My wife and I debated whether to take the Glacier Shuttle System, as we know that crowded conditions can always be an issue in popular National Parks, like Glacier. The Shuttles are free, after the initial park entrance fee of $30.00, (good for 7 continuous days), and are very clean and roomy. But I enjoy the freedom of stopping my vehicle at any of the many turn-outs. along Going-to-the-Sun road. The key for us was leaving early in the morning, (we started toward Logan Pass at 6:00 AM), and I just stopped where the spirt led. The morning lighting was dramatic! We experienced more shade on the Lake McDonald side of the road, and more sun on the Lake Mary side of the pass.We arrived at Logan Pass at 10:00 AM, (I stopped many times on the way up, including the Lake McDonald Lodge, the Loop, the Garden Wall, and other turn-outs). The parking lot at Logan Pass we 3/4 full at our arrival. We parked and spent time walking to the Hidden Lake Overlook. We saw white Mountain Goats and gray Big Horn Sheep while taking this 3.0-3.5 mile (easy) hike. The Logan Pass Visitors Center is also located here, with interesting nature displays, and a gift shop.We continued down the Going-to-the-Sun road, (East of Logan Pass), passing many beautiful spots. We had packed a lunch so enjoyed it while overlooking Lake St. Mary at a vista point called ""Rising Sun."" Pre-planning a lunch turned out to be a great idea!

It is two lane. there are stone or wood barricades on the side that drops off to the valley so you feel as though you've protection against driving off the mountainside. It was not as scary as we'd been led to believe. Parking at the pass is limited and you amy have to drive around for awhile until you secure a place to park.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,The Going to the Sun road is a must do. There is a shuttle service offered. It is a great idea to use the service so you can enjoy the view since the road is narrow in areas. BUT the service for the east side is terrible! We waited 45 minutes for a bus to pick us up at one of the stops. When the full size bus arrived it was packed full of people with no standing room left. We had to wait another half an hour to finally get pictured up. Some of the other hikers waiting decided to hitchhike instead of wait over 75 minutes to be picked up. This was not a one time occurrence either. Passengers were telling about other days that were just as bad. The shuttle service is in place to cut down on the number of cars driving the GTSR but unfortunately people are so frustrated with the service or should I say lack of service that they are choosing to drive instead. ,"September 14, 2016",Beautiful views! ,40,Texas,4

There is also a shuttle bus that you can take down the road too, so that is a good option for hiking.

What I'm going to type, then, surprises even me.Going-to-the-Sun Road is probably the most beautiful drive in the country. When you factor in the overlooks and the hikes available at its edges, it sets it apart from the rest of the drives that might fall into this category. When you consider the engineering feat of completing this road in 1932, it makes Going-to-the-Sun road absolutely incomparable.When we arrived at Glacier National Park, we had just come from Yellowstone. At one point on the roads of Yellowstone, we were amid a backup of several dozen cars, and when we finally crept up to the roadblock, we asked a bystander what the delay was. He pointed into the woods and said, ""black bear."" Now, I know it's cool to see a black bear no matter how you manage to, even if you're elbowing other tourists out of the way to do so. But on Going-to-the-Sun Road, things don't happen for throngs of tourists. They happen just for you.Within one hour on the road in a light shower, we pulled off to take a short hike, where we saw a moose wading in turquoise water below. She stared at us because we were the only ones there. When the rain stopped, a complete, bold rainbow formed, stretching from the mountains on one side of St. Mary Lake to the other. We were the only ones we saw stopping to look at it because we were the only ones we could see. Then, back in our car on Going-to-the-Sun Road, a mountain lion loped across our path. When we pulled up to the spot where he had crossed, he was standing on the hillside looking back at us. And no one else was there to witness it, or cause a traffic jam, or point out and say, ""mountain lion."" Just us.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The Going to the Sun highway connects the east side of Glacier National Park with the west side of the park. It is a winding and frequently narrow highway that going east to west climbs up to Logan Pass and then down to Lake McDonald. Vehicles are restricted to 21 feet in length and maximum speed is 45mph. It is about 50 miles in length and takes about 2 hours; however the views are breathtaking and there are many pullouts and hiking trails so it can easily consume 3 or 4 or more hours of enjoyment. If you love to drive - we did it in a classic 1950s convertible - it is fun to do by car. However, Glacier National Park operates a fleet of beautiful red 1936 White Tourist busses that provide guided tours of the highway for those who prefer that option. The highway is only open for 3 or 4 months beginning in June. If you are traveling east to west, the Rising Sun Restaurant is the only dining option before Lake McDonald Lodge on the west end.

No campers or motor homes allowed as the road is twisty-twiney for long and high vehicles. They have awesome small 1930's English style touring busses with open tops, to ride to Logan Pass. Awesome! At the top of the pass, you are literally driving through clouds-so awesome! We have a Prius C and the drive in it was easy, safe and picturesque.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"During our recent trip to Glacier National Park we drove this road three times. The vistas along the way are incredible. It's narrow and not for the faint of heart. At the top is the Logan pass visitor center. During the summer you have to get there before 10 o'clock in the morning or you will not get a parking spot. If you get a parking spot at Logan pass visitor center you must take the mile and a half walk up to the Hidden Lake Overlook. Not only are there dramatic views of the western half of the park, but there's also a family of Mountain goats up there that are so tame they might walk right up to you. They completely trust humans, which is not necessarily a good thing, but they let you take pictures and if they're up walking around they may just walk right up to you.

We then descended down the west side and had a lovely lunch at Lake McDonald. But then retracing our path going west to east we experienced horrible traffic and it was impossible to park at Logan Pass.

There were a few spots where I got nervous from the height but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The Ranger's Station and Information Center at Logan Pass was great.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Going to the sun road was amazing! We had a beautiful sunny day and the views were breathtaking! We got a late start but the crowds and traffic were not bad at all. We skipped Avalanche Creek on the way out due to crowds but only had to wait 5 minutes for a parking spot at Logan Pass at noon. There are a lot of pull-outs to let those in a hurry pass and we found some of the lesser known stops to be quite awesome! Be sure to pull out along Lake MacDonald to take in the lake views and walk down to sit among the beautiful colored rocks along the shore. Take snacks or pack a lunch as there are not many places to get food- Lake MacDonald Lodge and Rising Sun are the only two we saw. The Bighorn sheep were out near Logan Pass so be sure to bring binoculars- they are quite camouflaged among the rocks. We stopped to do only a few short hikes but due to the number of stops we made it took us about 10 hours to do the road west to east and then return via the road east to west. I definitely recommend doing the road in both directions, it was amazing how many different views we saw on the way back that we hadn't seen going west to east. We can't wait to get back- would like to try earlier in the season when the Falls have more water coming down- the Weeping Wall wasn't really weeping and many of the other Falls were a bit dry in late August.","September 2, 2016",Amazing day in the park,35,"Portland, Oregon",5

As an access portal for so many visitors, it is also congested - especially from 10 am to 3 pm. As a result, parking at all shuttle stops, pull-outs, and Logan Pass Visitor Center can be very difficult to find during this period. If you would like to drive, you ought to plan on entering the park earlier in the morning. We tried it both ways - shuttle and our own car - and learned that the free park shuttle - even with its peccadilloes - was the best way to navigate the park.

You may see wildlife on this drive, and you definitely get amazing views of the mountains, valleys, and glaciers. There are plenty of turn out spots to stop and take some pictures, or a quick break. You get a very nice peek of the park just from the comfort of your car. There are plenty of road signs too. I didn't have much trouble knowing where my stops would be. Only complaint are other drivers. Everyone is different, some want to go too slow, some too fast. I am not one of the too fast ones, but i do like to go a bit quicker. There is an excitement of driving winding roads. Therefore, there should be a bit more education on why its courteous to pull over and let others pass... even if they are going over the limit - though i wouldnt advise going over the limit.

We arrived later in the day and stopped first at the NP Station. We were told to take the ride then at 5pm because the hikers from day would be leaving for dinner.

We reached Logan pass around 6pm and did the Hidden Lake trail ( the best part of the trail is the trail and not the overlook which we did not think was so great).

The hike to Hidden Lake is easy and spectacular! Don't miss it. We did a short part of Highline Trail as well. Pretty scary along the cliff edges, but worth the experience.

The cost of the trip was very reasonable when one considers that the trip lasts six hours and the driver is comfortable with the winding road.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We have been on this road four times and it never fails to impress!!With every twist and turn the changing vistas are beautiful to awe-inspiring! Starting with the pretty, sapphire blue Lake McDonald and ending with the plains at St Mary's Lake, this road and its majesty is simply an amazing work of nature. A little trivia for those who saw the movie, The Shining--the opening lake scene was filmed at St Mary's. West to east is the best way to travel as you are on the outside of the mountain and really experience the depth and magnitude of the 1000+ feet drop offs. But if you are inclined to vertigo or have a strong fear of heights you might prefer east to west on the inside of the mountain. There is only one switchback and it is an easy one before you start to really climb, going west to east. Logan's Pass at the top is about 6800 feet, and usually pretty windy (as in wind blowing). So if it's in the 70s or less at the bottom of the road, you will want to take a jacket or sweatshirt. There is no way to explain the true beauty of this road. You simply have to experience it. And do it before all of the glaciers are gone. There originally were close to 150, 100 years ago. In 1968 there were 50 and now there are 25 (we have lost 10 since 2005). The prediction is they will be all gone by 2030 and some models predict earlier than that!!!The park will still be beautiful even without the glaciers but it's best to see it while the park's namesakes are still there.

Took 41/2 hours because stopped at every viewpoint and a few places there wasn't a viewpoint (don't worry - no cars behind so stopped in middle of road). Yes the drop is intimidating but my wife was on that side!!! If you live within a day or two drive, this is a must do.

I wish we would have left earlier--I hear that's when the animals are out. There is not a boring stretch on this road but toward the top the views are spectacular. We started on the West side and exited the East side. It takes a couple of hours with a few stops for pictures. There are lots of bikers, which seems super dangerous with so many blind corners.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Okay, so that is 3 words. In the 3rd week of August when we were there, it was very crowded on the road. I had prepared a list of spots on the road to stop at or to park and take shorter hikes. Yeah, good luck with that! Many of the overlook pulloffs were full and the parking lots for trails, too. It was pretty just driving along the road but that is not what we intended. At the parking lot for St. Mary's Falls we finally decided to sit in the lot and wait for a car to leave. Actually we were third in a queue of cars waiting. After about 20 minutes, it was our turn to park. The trail to St Mary's fall was 1.7 miles round trip. Walking further to the more spectacular Virginia Falls was longer, maybe 3/4 of a mile more. The first part of the hike was thru a burn area - small trees and the ubiquitous fireweed flowers. Then somewhat larger trees and bushes with berries. I kept thinking I was going to be eaten by bears who thought we were going to steal their berries. The park urged everyone to carry bear spray but we didn't. The trail here was heavily travelled so it seem safe. St. Mary's fall itself was pretty. People were jumping into the pool at the bottom of the fall. Going along on the trail there were lots of smaller cataracts before reaching the Virginia Falls, a more impressive 30' cataract. There is a bathroom up close to the falls.Back to the car, where more cars were queued up for a parking space, we drove on down the road. Never really finding another place to park, we ended up not going to the end of the road. It was getting late and we just turned back.I think the problem with the park is that there is just one major road and it is open for just a short time in the summer. Using the shuttle buses would be a better way to go. There are lots of shuttle stops.","August 23, 2016",One Word - Use the Shuttles,149,"Dayton, Ohio",4

Going-to-the-Sun Road,An engineering marvel but leave your car at one of the visitor centers and take the FREE hiker shuttle to access the trails. The free shuttles run continuously so that you could start at one end of trail and pick up the shuttle back to your car. Many of the lots simply get full of cars and then people park illegally and create a traffic mess. The road winds left and right but the views are more enjoyable when someone else is driving.

The road is narrow and steep and full of pulloffs so that you can look back down the valley and over the cliff to see where you have just been.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We drove Going to the Sun Road on July 4th with a cousin from Great Falls who was very familiar with the park. Having someone like this along, especially if you have limited time, is extremely helpful. He told us that it was unlikely that we would find a parking place, at the time of day we were going through, at Logan Pass. So we stopped at other, less crowded, places to take short walks and view other sights. There is so much breathtaking beauty that even the 'smaller' sights are memorable. If you only have one day Going to the Sun Road is the road to travel. If we ever go back again I would go early and drive straight to Logan Pass because it looked like there was lots to see in and around the Pass. Plus a nice visitor center. After looking around the Logan Pass area then I would drive the road again stopping at places that look interesting. However, even without being able to stop at Logan Pass we were not disappointed.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Of course, Glacier National Park is magnificent any season of the year and any time of the day. But, in my opinion, if you want to enjoy it the most, let the sun be your guide (you want it at your back, not in your eyes). So, if I had two days, I would drive in from the west (Kalispell) in the mid to late afternoon. Then, I would stay in Saint Mary or Browning or Shelby. On the second day, I would get to the park entrance between 8 and 9 AM, and leisurely go back across the Going-to-the-Sun Road. If I only had one day, I would get up very early and get to the east entrance (Saint Mary) by 9 AM and go from east to west. If you are staying on the west side, you can take Rt 2 around the south end of the park to get to the east entrance in the morning (it's about a 2 to 3 hour drive, but also very scenic). To me, the worst thing to do is to drive in from the west in the morning or midday. You are looking into the sun and the traffic is much more crowded on the west side.

There are numerous photo ops and a high likelihood of seeing some sort of wildlife. For beauty, I can't believe many places beat this.That said, it wasn't a great trip for a car load of old fat folk. Many of the areas require a certain amount of hiking; the limited number of roads make it both special and limiting.I ride a motorcycle and this would have been a wonderful road, though not on this particular day. I highly recommend it, but don't expect the amenities and unique features of our other Park. ","August 18, 2016",A Biker's Paradise,102,"Billings, Montana",5

So there a few blind turns with solid rock on one side and just a WPA-era 1 foot high stone wall on the other. Honestly, a stop light would make sense, but there isn't one.

All shuttle seats were filled by the time we got on, but the driver allowed additional passengers, including us, to stand in the aisle, so we did not get much of a view.One wise hiker got off at Siyeh Bend to hike Siyeh Pass, but most passengers, including us, ignored the black clouds hanging over the Continental Divide and took the shuttle all 17 miles up to Logan Pass, where we were smacked in the face with sleet and 30+ mph winds.Ironically, the East side of the park, where we had just come from, was still pleasant, so we scrapped our plans to hike the Highline Trail and followed a ranger's suggestion and took a shuttle back to Sunrift Gorge, and had a wonderful hike in to Virginia Falls, six miles for the in and out round trip.Two days earlier, I drove my rental car up to Logan Pass, in beautiful weather, and was unable to get a parking spot, so drove back east to park by Lunch Creek, for a worthwhile hike up Lunch Creek canyon.So our GTS Road learning is that it pays to have a back-up hike option in event of adverse weather, and if your goal is to get to Logan Pass come-what-may, there are definitely benefits to getting an early start, given the smallish parking lot and limited shuttle capacity.","August 7, 2016",Launching point for many great hiking options,10,"New York City, New York",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Where do I begin? Going to the Sun Road has to be the most scenic drive I have ever been on. So many highlights. So much beauty. It's about 50 miles from one end to the other. One just needs to take their time for the beauty and because the ascent from either side of Logan Pass is a narrow 25 mph road. The road has lots of pullouts, so take advantage of as many as you can. Starting from the west, the road skirts the shores of Lake McDonald. A detour into Apgar gets the best view of the lake. Past Lake McDonald, the road follows McDonald Creek for a while. The main highlight here is the Trail of the Cedars. The west side of the road is the wetter and greener side. The road starts climbing shortly after the Avalanche area. Near the tunnel are great views of aptly named Heavens Peak. The road pretty much hugs the Garden Wall the rest of the way up to Logan Pass. Great views of the valley below and waterfalls abound. Bird Woman Falls is the big one. Once you get past Oberlin Bend the road summits at Logan Pass at the Continental Divide. In the summer months, this part of the road can be a traffic nightmare. The lot is full and the rangers are out directing traffic. Just a forewarning. Logan Pass is definitely worth stopping at. The road then begins its descent down toward the drier east side. Past Siyeh Bend the road starts to straighten out more. There are highlights over here as well. Jackson Glacier is the best spot to see a glacier. St. Mary Falls and Sunrift Gorge are close to each other. Both worth stopping for. This area suffered the fire last year which makes the scenery more interesting. The remaining part of the road skirts St. Mary Lake. Great views of little Wild Goose Island seem to be the popular choice here. Best place to see it is from the actual overlook area. The road ends at St. Mary near the visitor center. No matter where you are on this road, the views of the mountains are astounding. The road should be on everyone's bucket list. The road may not actually be heaven, but it has to be close. Go see it!","August 6, 2016",Road To Heaven On Earth,403,"Lynnwood, Washington",5

The views were spectacular, and we had no problem pulling over lakeside, and at several waterfalls. We turned back part way down Logans Pass as we felt some drivers had no experience of narrow roads and were forcing us into the edge.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"When I first saw that a few people had submitted some pretty low ratings for this road I wondered how that could possibly be. Just reading a few made me quickly realize how easily bad weather or too much traffic could ruin the experience. I lucked out with the weather and, even though Logan Pass was already full when I started westbound, crowds elsewhere weren't bad and the traffic itself was moderate at worst. The traffic had increased considerably by the time I made the return drive although it still was not all that heavy. So I had a great experience on a road I'd long looked forward to and which very well might be the most scenic I've ever driven. On the other hand, I readily accept that rain, fog, or gridlock could change that perception in an instant. ","August 6, 2016",Scenic drive extraordinaire,239,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5

There are several trailhead pullout along the road and I suggest driving it from Lake McDonald to St Mary lake and then from St Mary back to Lake McDonald for a different view perspective each way.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Unbelievable, over the top spectacular. Simply a must see. However, the information provided by the Park Service regarding vehicle access really only makes complete sense after you have been there and no what ""no trailers or RVs past avalanche"" means. Let me spell it out; no trailers or larger than normal vehicle sized RVs allowed on going to the sun road. Full stop. With good reason. They will never make it. This road is very winding but mainly it is VERY narrow. If you plan to bring a trailer or RV camp on the West side of the park near Fish Creek and Lake McDonald Lodge areas. This way you can leave your trailer and have access to other areas, markets etc. as well as this terrific drive. If you have a large RV you can hitch a ride on one of the park tour cars for the drive at Lake McDonald Lodge. These tour vehicles are very cool by the way. If you camp on the East side near St Mary you may not be able to make this spectacular drive and you do not want to miss it. Not for the faint of heart. The exceptionally narrow road and steep drop off will cause concern to some. But believe me............well worth it.

So, if your lodging or campground is on the opposite side of the park from the side in which you enter you may encounter a problem if you have to drive the “Going to the Sun” road at night. It can certainly be done, but it takes a VERY LONG TIME at night and you may end up arriving at your final destination much later (and grumpier) than you expected.It should also be noted that the area around the Many Glacier hotel is somewhat disconnected from the rest of the park. As such, it is probably wise to set aside a separate day or two to explore this area and not try to combine it with something else.","August 2, 2016",Plan Carefully Before Doing This Drive,95,Tampa Florida,5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We've been to a good many National Parks in the West and this one may be our new favorite, thanks to Going to the Sun Road. This is nothing short of amazing. And it was built in the 1930's as a CCC project. It is now a 3-time designated landmark making it unique in the US. Plan on at least 2 hours to make the drive as there are numerous stops along the way where you can get out and take photos and hike. The road is narrow but all the drivers were polite and obeyed the speed limit which was pretty much 25mph the whole way.","August 2, 2016",Utterly Amazing!,256,New Mexico,5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"You can't miss this road, as it is the main drag between East and West Glacier. Plan on spending over 2 hours to get from one side of the park to the other. And make SURE you have plenty of gas in your car BEFORE you enter the park. There are so many pull-offs and pedestrian crossings, so please be careful and stay alert.

Don't get me wrong, the scenery on the middle section is wonderful - maybe the best I've seen from a road. But, as a means of getting from point A to point B, this road is nothing but an aggravation. It is the main road of the park. It is extremely popular. It allows tour buses to basically stop in the road. It allows bicycles on most stretches to ride though no bike lanes exist.

But the views are incredible, breath-taking, any word to describe the definition of a National Park. There are a few side hikes along the way during the drive. Spots to see during the drive: McDonald Creek (as for the side trial that’s not really on the map to a cool waterfall at the tip of the lake), Avalanche Creek (the BEST hikes, goes past beautiful gorges, and spits out at a lake with an incredible view and reflection, you can also hike to the other end of the lake which is worth it), the Weeping Wall, Bird Woman Falls, Jackson Glacier, and Wild Goose Island/St. Mary Lake.","July 30, 2016",the FIRST thing you must do in Glacier NP,94,"Tampa, Florida",5

I would recommend through from West to East and stopping only at small pull outs for photos and to take in the scenery. You really need to drive all the way to St.Mary to get the full effect. The east side is less crowded. After driving through I would recommend using the shuttle system during the busy summer season for hiking.

The road gets VERY crowded and the pullouts fill up, so if you want to be able to stop and not worry so much about traffic, drive it super early or late. Anything else will be very slow and the parking will be full if you have to travel during the summer like we do.

If you are afraid of heights this is Not for you. Logans pass is nice to see. Lots of hiking. If you choose. Small gift shop up top not prepared for influx of people. Was lined up like crazy.

From the heavens above to the river below your vantage point you can appreciate His creation while trying to figure out why mankind is set out to destroy such a work of art and beauty. In fact, atheists, agnostics and others can also view the scenery with an inner appreciation of their own physical existence.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"There are no words to adequately describe this site. Glacier National Park is one of a kind. The Sun Road gives you the chance to enjoy multiple ecosystems in the park from the comfort of your car, from one of the park's free shuttle buses, or from one of the park's signature Red Buses. These are rather expensive & I have never taken one of these tours as a result. This trip I had my own Subaru and enjoyed several trips up & over. Things to be aware of: if you plan to park at Logan Pass, get there before 9:00 am. Otherwise you are unlikely to get a parking spot. The Logan Pass Visitor Center is the most accessible way to quickly experience the alpine tundra. The 1.5 mile Hidden Lake trail will give you a 1-2 hour true taste of the place, as well as likely up close visits with wildlife like mountain goats & bighorn sheep. For the truly adventuresome, the Highline Trail will give you some of the best views of the park. Not for those with fears of heights. Speaking of which, much of the Sun road is along sheer cliffs. I personally have no problem hiking across sheer cliffs, but driving them is a bit unnerving. For those in the same boat as me, there are guard rails throughout (most of them low rock walls). There are two tunnels, one of which has two view ""Windows,"" which is very unusual. Overall, in a typical 90 min trip over the Sun road you will see two very large glacial lakes (one on each side), subalpine forest, an amazing array of wildflowers, many waterfalls at varying distances, at least one remaining true glacier (pull off at the Jackson Glacier overlook for a better view), many towering peaks that have been dramatically shaped by glaciers, incredible near and long range views and likely wildlife sightings of everything from the humble Columbian ground squirrel to the mighty grizzly. But if you are afraid of heights, let someone else drive or take the shuttle or Red Bus!","July 25, 2016",Must do!,89,"Candler, North Carolina",5

Honestly, the west side of this road prior to Logan's Pass is the best for views and the ""scariest"", except not scary at all. Lots of places along the way where you can stop for pics. 18:00 Stopped @ Logan's Pass visitors centre and walked along the Hidden Valley path, saw a Mountain Goat and bought some items @ the gift shop. 19:00 Stopped @ Jackson's Glacier - the only glacier you can see from the road. Then we planned to see a night show @ 20:00 but we looked at the wrong date so we ended up heading back to our hotel. All in all - an incredible day! Now, if you want to compare parks, we live in Calgary and so Banff/Jasper area is by far our favourite. But we love how GNP offers the neat driving experience along the cliff with a great number of places to stop to take photos along the way and also more hiking.

Starting about 9am, it is difficult to find parking in the pull outs, and you will get a ticket if you park on the shoulder of the road. Definitely worth the drive. On a side note, the only wildlife we saw were a few deer and a coyote, and we got up at 4:30am to drive around the park looking... I don't know if we were just unlucky, but, I would say this is maybe not the park to find wildlife easily. Yellowstone is a better choice for that. Make sure you brink a sweatshirt or light jacket.

We drove from St Mary Lake rather than from West Glacier and this seemed to be the less popular option so to begin with we had many sights to ourselves. The road itself is an experience though I was glad that my partner was driving! The engineering is extraordinary. We particularly loved the weeping wall of waterfalls and the spectacular sights of mountains, particularly Heaven's Peak.

Keep in mind that unless you are physically able to hike rough terrain for several miles, it might be the ONLY thing you CAN do at Glacier.

If you want to be chauffeured through the park take the free shuttle or hire on of the private tours. Be sure to stop at the numerous overlooks and trailheads along the road. There are over 700 miles of trails. There are beautiful views around every corner. The views get better and better as the road climbs. The snow melt water running down the waterfalls is just magnificent. It is not uncommon to see animals along the road. We saw a small bear who wandered onto the road. We also saw a few deer. Depending on the time of year, it can be difficult to park at many of the stops and at the visitor centers. The road can get crowded and travel can be slow. Early morning and evening is the best time for the trip. Large RV’s and trailers are not permitted on this narrow winding road so park at one of the entrances and take the shuttle.

Shimmering glacial lakes, jagged mountains, meadows and wildflowers, countless waterfalls. We followed the suggestions of others and took the free park shuttle to Logan Pass before I tried to drive the narrow, high parts myself. I'm so glad we did. I knew what to expect then, and when we drove it in our own vehicle, I was prepared and knew where we wanted to stop for longer viewing time and for photos. Also, we would not have been able to park at Logan Pass to hike as the lot fills up quickly.

Just down from Logan pass near were the Reynolds' fire was, several cars had pulled over and people were taking photos. SO glad we stopped. There was a honey colored grizzly with her yearling cub. I kept at a safe distance to take some pictures. My friend who lives in Kalispell had only seen black bear and this was her first grizzly sighting.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The drive itself was nowhere near as difficult or scary as I had been led to believe by many reviews on the web. I am not a great fan of scary mountain drives but it was really very easy and we found for the most part other road users were courteous other than the few who can't park properly in pull outs. We were there earlyish in July and while it was indeed very busy, there was none of the bumper to bumper stuff people complain about. I do wish we had arrived significantly earlier to get a park at Logan's pass. It was closed and we were waved on by the Rangers as it was full and no options were open to stop anywhere nearby. This was disappointing as we had been looking forward to going on the hike. If we had more time to spend I would have parked well past it near a shuttle stop and grabbed the shuttle back to the visitor centre. That way we could get the best of both worlds. As it was we made do with continuing the drive through to the end and gave Logan's pass a miss. Having just been to Jasper and Banff I think that it was tough to match the epic scenery.

If you visit during July & August the park service operates a free shuttle from either St. Mary or Apgar Visitor Centers up to Logan Pass. It makes regular stops at the popular trail heads so you don't have to worry about fighting for a spot in the limited parking areas along the road and at the top. Or you can always opt for a Red Bus or Sun Tour to take a guided bus tour over Going to the Sun Road. If you elect to take a self-tour over the road check out the multimedia page of the Glacier National Park website has a podcast you can listen to as you drive.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We were staying in whitefish and the trip to west glacier took about 45 mins to the park entrance. It costs $30 for a seven day pass which is the most cost effective entry if there is more than 2 of you in the car. Yes the roads are busy but the scenery is breathtaking so why hurry? It is true what the guidebooks tell you about how difficult it is to park at Logan's pass, we gave up on the way up, but a few miles down the road saw a herd of mountain goats and were able to pull over easily to photograph them. Further on we saw a black bear in an open field although the ranger was quite rightly stopping everyone from stopping. There are lots of restrooms en route and when you arrive at st Mary's there is a very informative display. For those used to taking holidays in Italy or Swtzerland, the roads are well maintained and although precipitous, not hair raising! Do be warned that the weather changes very quickly so the drive back can be a little challenging if it rains at the top of the route, in the same vain, take layers - on our trip the temp went from 85 to 53f in 4 hours!","July 16, 2016",Unmissable,38,"Epsom, United Kingdom",5

The only way to stop along the way for us was to rent a car or do a tour. Either way expensive. Overrated. If you can get to Jasper NP in BC, it is the best NP of our 13,000 trip. Disappointed.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Firstly, I recommend driving down the road. You will see the valley below. You will not be hugging the Cliffside - more often you are on the inside of this narrow winding road.It is intimidating to drive. RVs and trailers are not permitted. You will see an entire mountain range set back by a valley that is probably 3000 below the road. I don't really know but it is a fair estimate.We drove around the east side of the park as our return to the campsite on our first tour.

Give yourself time to truly spend on the road. One could go over it in about 45 minutes, but so much would be lost. Go one direction in the morning, and return the opposite direction in the evening.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Too many people! My husband and I just returned from a 16 day trip to Glacier and Waterton Parks. Although the towering mountains are spectacular, the crush of humans is intolerable. We hiked through burned out St. Mary area to St. Mary Falls and beyond. Yes the falls were pretty, but the trail is PACKED which detracts from the sense of peace and quiet one looks for in the great out of doors. The Bullhead Lake hike was a better experience because we hiked early in the day and didn't have to fight for a parking spot or space on the trail. When we got back to our car, other cars were lined up forever along the once empty road side. Going to the Sun Road? Don't drive it! Take a Red Bus Tour…fabulous alternative to bumper to bumper driving…honestly, the entire 40 mile long road was bumper to bumper with virtually no place to park at Logan Pass if you have a car. The Many Glacier Road is a disaster in great need of repair. Very slow driving to get to this northerly area of the park…hotels and trailheads are at the end of the road, but if you go late, good luck in finding a parking spot. Glacier needs to get serious about preserving the environment of the park and find a way to ameliorate the horrendous influx of people --it is ruining the experience.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Just wrote about this in my review of Glacier Nat'l Park. This is a road that climbs up and around the mountains, where someone actually sees the drop offs as you driving. The views are magnificent. The first week of July there is actually snow left along the roadway that water running from the mnts. is cutting paths under the snow. Wildlife is around, the mnt. goats etc. This is a must see and get a look at the Glaciers that remain before they disappear.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,This is one of the best roads in America. We've driven it multiple times and each time I'm amazed at the spectacular views. Fill up your gas tank and plan to stop often. We took lunch at Logan pass which is a great mid point but just be prepared to drive for 20 minutes looking for a parking space. Don't be in a rush and just enjoy the drive. I've seen reviews where people prefer driving west to east however I didn't really see a difference. ,"July 12, 2016",Worth the price of admission!,8,"Lake Arrowhead, California",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,Going to the Sun Road is the most beautiful road I've ever driven. During our visit we drove it a total of 4 times! The duration of the drive will obviously depend on how many stops you make for photos. There are countless places to pull over and take in the views. I'd say if you are taking lots of brief stops along the road at all the major points (to include Logan's Pass) the drive will take you 3.5-4 hours. If you drive strait through from the West entrance to the East entrance then about 2 hours. If you want to see Many Glacier and are staying on the West side you can make a day trip out of it. Leaving at 7:30am and a few major stops along the way we were able to get to Many Glacier by 10-10:30. We got in a hike up to Grinnell Lake and up close to Grinnell Glacier (couldn't go all the way safely due to snow/ice blocking the path). We came back and had dinner right at 5pm when the restaurant at Many Glacier Hotel opened and didn't have to wait for seating. We were back to the West side and our cabin just outside the entrance by 9pm.,"July 12, 2016",One of the Most Beautiful Roads in the US,72,"Wilmington, North Carolina",5

But the scenery itself is Amazing! Once you start getting up in elevation the road narrows and there's a rock wall on one side and nothing on the other. Might be a little dicey for some.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This road connects two sections of Glacier National Park, west to the east side at St. Mary's. Park maps say it takes 1.5 hours to travel, I think. No way. There are hikes along it, waterfalls falls, weeping rock roads, grizzlies and black bear, coyotes, mountain goats, ram, glaciers, lakes, islands on lakes, forests, and more! Taking pictures only would take closer to three or more hours your first time.Our first time, well...It didn't happen. Part of the road iced over in early July that year. Warning: don't make plans depending on crossing this road only. Parts may at times close and the long way around is Long. If you are so fortunate, from early July through the summer, you Might complete this miraculous all-American journey!My favorite part of the road is Logan's Pass, about mid-way. It has a hike to Hidden Lake, where the mountain goats hang out, while ram come to the parking lot on occasion. This is one of the coldest areas on the road, and this July 7th, still had snow a good way of this 1.5 hike (uphill, worth it!!). You'll also like St. Mary's side with glacier reflections on the lake. Trail of the Cedars rocks accessibility for everyone with boardwalks among giant cedars, and more. Bring warm and cool weather clothing in summer, and waterproof jackets. We transitioned also from tennis shoes to waterproof hiking boots for snow trails. Several restaurants are off this road, but expect to eat before 9 or 10 p.m. The main areas also have General stores and in some cases camping. Hikes from short to long distances abound.

Somewhat calmer traffic-wise and, for our money, better views and the traffic pull outs were waay more empty. Probably 80 percent of the people go from west glacier to logan and then turn back. This route is a bit more out of the way unless you are staying on the east side (we stay in Essex at the Isaac Walton) but worth the extra time.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We've driven many of the more beautiful and challenging highways across the US, including the Needles Highway in South Dakota, the Beartooth Pass, and the Keys Highway. In terms of beauty, the Going to the Sun Road is at the top of the list. With plenty of pull offs and scenic view areas, it makes it a pleasure to drive. It is not, however, a difficult or exceedingly dangerous road to drive. Due to the design of the road, there is only one switchback, which makes it easier to navigate than Needles or Beartooth, for example. Nevertheless, the driver must pay constant attention and not be afraid to hug the rock walls on the shoulders as some turns are quite narrow. We actually took the Red Bus Tour first so that we could experience the road, and pick out which spots we wanted to spend more time at, and then on the next day drove the road ourselves to do just that. If you have the time, I highly recommend this approach--you'll learn more about what you're seeing, enjoy the ride more, and then still be able to drive it and take it off your bucket list!","July 8, 2016",A Must See or Do Drive,66,"Durham, North Carolina",5

So in our opinion, you must do it both directions. There are quite a few pull offs, but remember if you're there in the busy season, you may not always be able to pull off where you want. The road was very busy and you need to pay attention. People were constantly darting out in front of you to get pictures, oftentimes in places that weren't too safe.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Practically everyday we were at GNP, we ventured onto the Going to the Sun Road. Everytime we were on the GTTSR we saw something new and continued to be impressed with what we had seen the first time. Be prepared to stop frequently and pull over and just look in awe. We began most days on the east side of the park and went southwest on the road. This way the sun was at our back most of the time for the best viewing. We also got an early start most days to avoid the most crowded times of the day and in hopes of seeing more wildlife along the road. While we didn't see much wildlife, we did avoid major crowds at most locations. Be sure to read about how the road was made and how there were 2 proposals for how to get up and down the mountain. The original was with 7 switchbacks and the other was with just the one. Using just the one left the side of the mountain less interrupted and gave the visitors better views. You can not just do the road once......just simply too much to see. Many of the trails are accessed by the GTTSR, and many of them are not totally difficult, so I advise taking at least a short hike occasionally and seeing what GNP has to offer.

Some unique features I haven't seen before like the weeping wall. If possible, I would recommend a smaller vehicle. We had to pull up on some curbs to keep our extended cab truck out of the road. It was too long. Some spots my husband wouldn't even attempt to pull into. My 1st time here & my husband has been here about 35 times. We both agreed it is one of the prettiest places we have ever been. We do regularly visit parks. This was a short 1 day visit for us. Don't do it though.

We stopped at many of the scenic overlooks, walked along some of the shorter trails and took our time enjoying the magnificent views. After leaving the park, we headed south to East Glacier Village on hi way 49 & then to hiway 2 and took a scenic route through Essex and back to West Glacier, near our campground. You will be going past beautiful views of the backside of what you saw in Glacier park, the mountain ranges, rivers, and meadows.

We had done a 5-mile hike earlier in the morning, if I had to do it again I would skip the hike and just bike, as we ran out of steam at Birdwoman Falls, but the experience is one I won't ever forget. The incline is steep, allow for lots of time if you want to make it the entire 16 miles, but being able to absorb those views and not have to deal with oncoming cars or finding a place to park makes it worth every ache and pain.

We did the St. Mary side in the late afternoon and the West side the following morning (yesterday). We absolutely cannot wait to go back for a longer stay and some glamping in a cabin. Met a kind and knowledgable gift store employee named Evelyn who shared some good info on Grizzlies in the park (and helped me feel a little less freaked out about their presence - this is new territory for me for the most part). My husband and I never felt so peaceful in nature as we did here. The mountains most definitely gave us their healing blessings.

West Glacier approach has more trees and you see less distance although the river is running by your side and several stop places to get out and enjoy nature. We did see a black bear beside the road. Several cars stopped, everyone got out to see, park ranger had a hissy fit and turned on the emergency lights to clear the road. It's all good. Makes for great memories. East approach through St Mary and Many Glaciers is the dry side of the mountain so you can see forever. Recommend you drive up every road and smell the flowers.

Makes you forget about everything else while you're there. I was amazed by Yellowstone a few years before, but this place is mother nature at her finest. We were there in 2015 when the large fire occurred, and were so glad to have been able to travel the entire park before the road was closed. It was heartbreaking to have seen such beauty, and know that a fire was devastating the park and its wildlife only a day after. Not sure how it looks now, but this is definitely a trip to take!

I timed my drive so I left from the west side of the park as the sun was setting. Surprisingly, the road was nearly totally empty (though the still-smoldering wildfires of 2015 may have helped with that). There are occasional turn-outs so you can stop and take pictures. It's just one gorgeous scene after another. Yes, there are times it looks like you're going to slam the side of your car into a mountain.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"It's hardly unusual for places geared toward the tourist trade to resort to hyperbole in order to attract traffic. The U.S. National Parks Service, however, is blessed with landscapes that require no such finessing around the edges. So when you put rubber to pavement on Glacier National Park's Going to the Sun Road, you will frequently be reminded that the government thought of the name first.Though the glaciers show little chance of regaining their former glory, they still occupy many a crevasse and a ravine within the park's boundaries. And how ironic it is that you should get startlingly close-up views of these ice age relics while on your way, well, to the sun. The road crossing the park is rarely a white-knuckler, as its ascents and drops are meant to be Sunday-motorist friendly, but that only affords you more opportunities to gawk at what surrounds you, rather than gluing your eyes to the road in front of you. The road, while hardly desultory, does allow the landscape to determine its routing and that is to your great benefit, for it winds around the splendor of the park for nearly 50 miles. Along the way, you'll trace kaleidoscopic mountain rivers, sub-alpine fields of wildflowers, sparkling lakes, the requisite steep waterfalls pouring over steeply eroded hillsides, and then, as your elevation increases, vast panoramas of startlingly forbidding mountain ridges and peaks. On occasion, as you head to the sun, the road ahead can be blindingly bright and it can get very hot in the park in mid-summer as well. There's only one place to stop for refreshments, and it's roughly at the mid-way point, so bring some water in with you -- particularly if you plan on venturing out on foot from time-to-time. This gloriously scenic park can't help but enthrall every shading of nature lover that it welcomes. The diversity of its topography combined with the access it delivers to its scenic wonders quite rightfully is often regarded as unmatched in the U.S. National Park system. And don't be in any hurry to scamper back to civilization once leaving the park's boundaries. Going to the Sun Road does not loop back to its origin, but the highways on the outside of the park, leading from East Glacier to Kalispell, make up for whatever drama-deficits they might suffer in comparison with the park road. You'll encounter extremely light car traffic to meddle with the mountain west scenery still very much in evidence, but far more sprawling than the succession of spectacles within the park. The sensation of being very much on your own here provides a timely contrast with the somewhat off-putting sense of confinement that is the bane of any National Park. But gas up *before* entering the park on the west side, because there is not going to be any service stations until you near Kalispell again. After all, why would there be? There's no cars out there.","January 21, 2016",The Sun Road to the ice,80,"Chicopee, Massachusetts",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Unfortunately, the optimal time to carry out road construction is during tourist season because the road is open for only three or four months of the year. If you're utilizing the road to get the heck out of the park, then get out early in the morning before the RV drivers wake up. The sun rises early in the summer, so it is possible to be up at five and on the road to sight see, stop casually to read some roadside info signs and get through the park although I'm not certain why there were people rushing to get out of Dodge on the days we happened to be visiting. There are fascinating roadside info signs about how and when the road was constructed. Or best obtain a tour book and read up on it in advance. Either way, nice to be on the road early before traffic and construction crews bog it down by 8:00. I consider this road a toll road because park entrance fee is required to use it. NPS pass allows access.","January 16, 2016",Patience is a virtue during construction season,47,"Coppell, Texas",5

It is narrow, twisty turns, but beautiful to look across the valley at the mountains. In the spring there are lots of waterfalls from the runoff, in the fall not so much. We did a Red Bus Tour later on our visit, and would highly recommend doing that. It's a little pricy, but well worth it.

We did see some mountain goats nearby. We stopped at the iconic McDonald Lodge near the west end of the park - well worth the stop.

We saw Big Horn Sheep, and lots of Mountain Goats. We also hiked part of the Highline Trail and as the name suggests there is a very steep, narrow, high ledge with a hose line installed on the side of the rock/mountain to hold onto for part of the trail. A worthwhile hike but not for the faint of heart.GTTSR is awe-inspiring and I would do it again in a heartbeat if I am ever in the area again.

We were able to see the results fire that blew up a few weeks prior that burned on either side of the GTTS road for probably 3-4 miles. It gives you an idea of how dangerous these fires are. But also, we noticed that even a few weeks after the fire, there was already green grass sprouting up here and there in the fire's path. So, it shows how nasty nature gets, it's pretty resilient. Reminds me of the fires of '88 in Yellowstone where the trees are now 15' feet tall in the massive blackened areas of that firestorm year. Nature isn't all sunshine and daisies but it sure is amazing. We'll see how the area looks next year. Other than that, it was its usual spectacular drive and views. But, the shoulder seasons are when we like to see it. More animals, fewer tourists (like us). On the mid-August trip, Logan pass parking lot was full so we had to go elsewhere. When visiting in the shoulder seasons (early summer and Fall), Logan Pass is a definite destination. Plan a couple hours to take a hike (and remember your sweater/jacket).

Never felt ""dangerous"" or scary though.Crowds were low on our day, but there was very high wind gusts that gave an even richer feel of tension on some of those naked feeling hairpin turns.

For this reason, the road was not too crowded and easy to drive. Either way, busy season or not, plan the day to take this road and make as many stops as you want along the way.

I won't lie ... dreamed about it for days after -- both the cliffs and the beauty. You must do it!Do a lot of research before you go as to the seasons. I think summer would be difficult because of crowds. When we were there in late September, many things were already closed for the season. I think early September would be the best time to go.Try to find mountain goats. They are super cool to watch. Look for people at the side of the road with binoculars.

Roads were nice up until around 9, that's when the circus comes to town.9 out of 10 people who drove on this road while I was there have no reason to be behind the wheel. They had no concept of how to drive, most thought there cars were 2-3 feet wider and refused to stay in their own lane. It gets even worse when the Red tour buses start running. Those drivers are incredibly rude and refuse to use a pullout when they are driving too slow, but god forbid you get in front of one, they will tailgate you to the point that if you even tap your brake, they would easily slam into the back of you.Views on the road are nice, but being basically the only road in Glacier, made for a nightmarish trip with the amount of tourists.

If you want to stop at Logan's Pass you'd better get there by 10:30 and that was in September... not sure how early in summer when the crowds are worse.

The first day we tried to drive across it was very foggy by Logan Pass and we could only see fog for several miles, the next day was beautiful, however we had a later start and arrived at Logan Pass around 11 am (the 2nd weekend in Sept) The lot was full and lots of cars coming in so we did not stop. The Aspen trees were just starting to change and I think mid to late Sept would be perfect to see some color. If you can I suggest you drive the road both directions. If heights and steep drop offs make you nervous you may want to drive east to west. It took us about 4 hrs to drive across with many, many picture stops!

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"You could say going to the sun road is to glacier, what old faithful is to yellowstone. The # 1 attraction in the park, and for good reason. The sights are second to none. Wide open vistas,Mountain peaks, glaciers,waterfalls,Lakes,streams, and wildlife if your lucky.  The road is accesable (When open) on two sides. From the east and west entry points. We drive this road several times during our 6 day stay and did it in both directions. It has a different perspective from each way and equally impressive from either direction. There are several viewpoints along the 52 mile or so road as well as a number of parking places to trailheads. I would do some homework before going and pick the ones you want to see in advance. There is no way you can do them all in a week let alone a day.  Tour books can be bought at local book stores or on line. I would get something before your trip and plan ahead of time. My favorite spots to visit was , the weaping wall, logans pass,wild goose island lookout, birdwoman falls,jackson glacier overlook, and the hairpin turns up on the summit. We meaning me , my wife and brother in our 50s and in reasonable shape. are not hikers more like walkers. so day hikes are out of the question. one mile hikes or 2 mile max is our speed. We did the trail of the ceaders, several pull outs near there for the river/fall areas. We tried the hidden lake trail at logans pass but with high winds and frozen ears not to mention all the stairs we just pooped out half way up. The highline trail got one look and the downhill trail and turned around. I know getting old sucks. We did manage to see a grizzly bear and black bear from the pull outs, on the mountain side. I would bring a set of binoculars and the best telephoto lens you have.I own a 6oomm supertelephoto lens and that had a hard time getting shots. I would also suggest bringing a packed lunch for there are little to no food options along the road. OR plan on eating at the start or finish of the road where food can be purchased. There is so much to see here so plan on spending the whole day or do it in sessions a little bit each day. We came and went several days as the weather was so crazy with the high winds and fog. so we would go in the am to do a portion of the road and leave when the winds kicked up . come back latter in the day and so on. For all you non hikers like us, You can see and do quite alot on this road so dont let that stop you from seeing it. I am not afraid of heights and am i good driver so I would prefer to drive myself rather than take a tour. This also gave us the advantage to come and go as we wanted also to hang around if we saw wildlife. You are on the buss tours time on the tour and cant do that. Besides, i did not think that this road was all that bad or hard. You just have to slow down at the turns and you will be fine. IT would help if you put the car in a low gear when going downhill it will save on your breaks. For all you speed racers out there, I know this is the only road that goes directly through the park. God only knows why you need to get through it before the rest of us. could you please get off my tail end or at least do the speed limit. Have some respect for your fellow travelers and or the park wildlife!! As for you slow moving onlookers, Please use one of the many pull outs and let the cars behind you pass by. We all want to see the park we just need to cooperate a little............ P S Rest rooms are at some of the viewpoint areas (mostly Pit toilets) there is restrooms at logans pass and st marry visitor center and at lake mccdonald. Also you may burn through a sd card in your camera here so i would bring at least two 8 gb cards. Above all go at your own pace do what you feel comfortable with and enjoy.","September 16, 2015",The best that glacier has to offer!!,384,Elgin Illinois,5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I visited Glacier National Park this July and fell in love with it. Going to the Sun Road is something out of a movie. We drove it on two separate days - one was foggy and the other full of sunshine - and both days were glorious. It doesn't matter what the weather is because the views are just breathtaking and it was cool to see it in both weather settings. After seeing historic photos of people driving up Going to the Sun road too, it also felt very nostalgic to make the drive knowing people had been basking in its glory for years. It was cool to find out it was also deemed an engineering feat. Made me appreciate the road that much more. It is windy, somewhat narrow and you do drive semi-close to the edge of the mountain, so I would suggest volunteering the best driver to take you through this scenic drive. I always felt safe, but did find myself instinctively leaning away from the mountain as passenger on our way back. haha :) This is a can't miss though. You will drive by several overlooks, amazing hikes (so make sure to stop for a couple). You'll see waterfalls, beautiful green trees on the mountain next to snow and deep valleys.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I had originally planned to pedal my bicycle along the Going to the Sun Road and over Logan's Pass but discovered that there was an 11:00 until 16:00 curfew for bicycles. I hired a car and drove through the park an over Logan's Pass. My first impression was good despite the fact that the views across the valleys were impeded by intermittent low cloud and rain.I returned in the opposite direction a day later and the experience was totally awesome! A friend joked that if I drove off the edge of the road at Logan's Pass summit, I'd die of starvation before I hit the bottom of the fall. It felt that way as I nervously looked over the edge.The road is busy and drivers must accept that they will not always find spaces to pull of the road to take in the views. I wasn't disappointed by the experience and would happily return for another crossing or two.","September 15, 2015","A stunning experience in good weather, not so good with low cloud",81,"Leeds, United Kingdom",5

Took the Red Bus tour which I would recommend - unfortunately we started with 39 degrees and the driver insisted on rolling back the canvas roof - the blanket provided was not enough!!! We saw Big Horn sheep, Mt. Goats, Moose, and Grizzly & Black Bear, burnt out forest and natural beauty. I would recommend taking the tour up the Road to the Sun before you attempt to drive it on your own - I finally drove it but was hesitant. Logan Pass is a MUST - wildlife is abundant. The Saint Mary boat trip was great and gave you a different view of the landscape as well as informative with the ranger on board.

The guide was very knowledgable and she tried her best to point out some decent views for us. I'm glad she had some humorous storied to tell because we had limited views of the mts and glacier. She apologized frequently but we all knew she had no control over the weather. We did the Continental Tour so we had a long day. We had lunch in Many Glacier Lodge and that was delicious. I even left my hoodie there and they fed ex'd it to me for free! Great serviceThe 3 Lodges we saw that day are all different but very interesting to see.

Also, be aware that at any time you could come across cars stopped in the middle of the road while tourists took photos of the wildlife, usually bears. People are asked not to do this, but do it anyway. When I came through the park, on a Friday evening, two campsites were closed, one due to bear activity, and one due to a nearby brush fire, and all of the remaining campsites in the park were subsequently taken, so calling ahead might not be a bad idea.","September 12, 2015",Extraordinary,96,"Boulder, Colorado",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"1. Going to the sun road is the most scenic road I have traveled. It is the primary road going west to east across Glacier National Park. 2. Apgar is the start of GTTS on the southern tip of Lake McDonald, the largest lake within the park. Forests as far as the eye can see, with mountains looming on the far side of the lake. Apgar Inn on the lake and restaurants here. Free shuttle service start here.3. GTTS road is two lanes and flat here, running adjacent to the 10 mile long lake, passing Lake McDonald Lodge on the north side of the lake,4. Avalanche Creek has 100+ cars parked on the sides of the road and in the parking lots on both sides of the road. This is the transfer point for the free shuttle, with 12 passenger shuttle vans replacing the full size buses.5. The trail of the Cedars Nature Trail is a 1 mile circular boardwalk trail running from GTTS to Avalanche Creek, covered by dense forests. The boardwalk is flat with no stairs, a wheel chair accessible trail. Railings on the sides of the boardwalk, for out of control wheelchairs! 6. Avalanche Creek is the start of the 4 mile round trip Avalanche Lake trail. This is an uphill, dirt trail, running alongside the roaring creek, with thunderous waterfalls from the melting snow, under a dense canopy of alpine forest.7. I'm hiking in my women's Chako sport sandals, with light blue straps, as my hiking shoes became unglued from the 13 mile round trip Grinnell Glacier hike, the most beautiful hike I have ever done, two days earlier.8. Strenuous, as I'm careful not to bang my exposed toes against the rocks and tree roots littering the dirt trail. The sport sandals have a thick area, in front of the toes, and it is easy to adjust the straps to eject any pebbles getting under my feet. 9. Would have been good to have hiking sticks, but these are not allowed as carry on luggage.10. 75 minutes of uphill climbing, and the forests recede, with areas of brush, and then a large deep green Avalanche Lake.11. Lake is surrounded by tall mountains on the opposite side, with snow topped mountains, and waterfalls in the distance.12. A lady unhitches a kid off her back, the toddler promptly running into the lake, with the dad in quick pursuit, pulling the toddler out of the water, drying her off, and putting the toddler carrier on his back. Words between those two!13. I find an unattended hiking stick next to a bench, look around for the owner, and start off, only to be chased down a quarter mile later by a teenager of the Chinese lady owner!14. Going back is downhill, with the dense forest blocking out most of the sunlight. A guy carrying a child on his back, the kid missing a shoe!15. Another group has a kid singing Old McDonald had a farm, he hi he hi ho, over and over again. The wife can't stand that singing! 16. We encounter a few astonished women looking at my Chako sports sandals, seen only on teenage and college age ladies.17. Plenty of restrooms at the shuttle stop on GTTS, but all parking gone by 10am.18. After Avalanche, GTTS road goes uphill, and traverses across the mountain side. Sign says no vehicles longer than 21 feet. Vehicles wider than 9 feet, including mirror extensions risk hitting oncoming traffic. Tall campers will hit rock overhangs on the mountain side. 19. Another sign says no bickes between 11am and 4pm for the next 10 miles. Tough to pass a bicycle going uphill with the number of blind curves! 20. Vehicles on the outside of the road, have a 1 foot barrier of rocks separating them from a 1000 foot plunge into the deep forest covered gorge, while the inside lane is right against the rock wall of the mountain. Majestic mountains and glaciers in the background.21. Road is as narrow as 18 feet, with full size pickups, SUVs, and 15 passenger Red Bus convertibles, all crossing the center line, when they see my tiny Sonic coming the other way!22. GTTS reaches 'The Loop', the only hairpin curve in the road, The parking lot is filled. Weeping Wall, with water running down the walls of rock on the inside of the road. Triple Arches is where GTTS goes over three arches, supporting the road on the side of a mountain.23. Logan Pass is the Continental Divide, the top of a mountain pass, with a 300 vehicle parking lot filled up by 10am, and the start of the Hidden Lake and Highline trails. We did the 3 mile Hidden Lake hike, me in Chako sports sandals, and saw mountain goats. 24. We go down the east side, past more sheer cliffs. Single lane traffic controls -fire fighting in progress, with fire equipment alongside the road. No stopping, with convoys of vehicles escorted by a front running vehicle, and a vehicle bringing up the rear, both with roof flashing lights.25. Burned forests, both sides of the road, right up to the edge of the 10 mile long St. Mary's lake, running alongside GTTS. Rising Sun motel closed.26. Three weeks later, on Labor Day weekend, GTTS is closed at Logan Pass due to a snowstorm!","September 11, 2015",26 tips for enjoying Going To The Sun road,1950,"Sunnyvale, CA",5

Also you will be driving next to the mountain and not too scary with the great height if driving on the opposite side. Don't be afraid to backtrack if you miss some lookout points.

Mt. goats like to hang out up at Logan's pass. Hopefully smoke has cleared out for good. Otherwise, recommend going on a day after it rains.

Similar to Rocky's Mountain National Park's Trail Ridge Road, you are literally driving on the edge of the mountains and afforded great views of the park. Unlike The Trail Ridge Road which has many switchbacks, there is only one major switchback on the entire crossing. Even if you are a great driver, be very careful of those who are not. It can be very slow going in places, so just take your time and enjoy the view. If you or your passengers are faint at heart, I would consider taking one of the famous Red Car expeditions across.

You can get on and off the shuttle any time at major stops, but you do need to wait for the next shuttle (approx. 30 minutes), and there is no guarantee that there will be room on the shuttle.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We only had limited time to visit Glacier and had to visit on our way to Yellowstone. We went through West Glacier and decided to make the drive. The rangers at the entrance recommended we take the shuttle up from the visitors center to Logan's Pass since the parking lot was full and there was a long wait. After talking to a ranger at the center, we decided to drive because we didn't have time to take a shuttle back and forth for the 32 mile drive. We spent almost four hours on our drive which was worth it. Around almost every bend was a beautiful view, and the road climbs to over 8000 ft. There are plenty of turnouts for pictures or just hanging out. We started out about 10 am mid-August so we probably missed the school kids who had returned to school. We actually got to Logan's Pass and the visitor's center and went in for a few more views and souvenirs. On our drive we saw a deer, chipmunks, mountain goats, ground squirrels, water falls, the Weeping Wall. Different turnouts will describe the peaks and mountains you're viewing. It's very smoky because of the fires in the park which limited some views, but it was still worth it. Leaving the park was a bit of a hassle with some roads closed. We got helpful info from the rangers and local stops along the way. No internet connection in the park, so plan ahead. Entry fee is $25 for 1-7 days.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We drove the Road to the Sun from West Glacier up to the Logan Pass visitor center. The first part of the drive is by the lake and pretty mild, but once you start climbing you go up fast. If you're in a truck FOLD YOUR MIRRORS IN.

If you're in a rush when driving you will only be stressed and not enjoy the drive. The parking lot at Logan pass was marked as ""Full"" (it was a Sunday afternoon that we were there) so after a couple of laps around it with people holding spots for their friends we drove East and parked at a pulloff and walked the 1/4 mile back. There's not much inside the visitor center but it is the start to several different trails and hikes. On the way back we ran into some falling rocks right in front of my truck.

I think I may have had more anxiety driving in the mountains than the average driver. I pulled over several times so I wouldn't back traffic up too much. I thought going down would be easier than going up but I kept having to fight thoughts of the brakes going out. The scenery and wildlife are magnificent. McDonald Lake has the clearest water I have ever seen. I felt like we would never reach the summit, and as the driver I couldn't really enjoy the views as much as everyone else. If you have a fear of driving on mountainous roads you might consider taking one of their tours. I was pleasantly surprised that the park wasn't overly crowded in August 2015.

I thought we'd never find a space but we finally got smart and followed some people leaving and got our turn signal on right away. There are some fires going on and I imagine that may have kept some people away.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Our second visit, and even with the smoke from forest fires somewhat obstructing the views, this is one of the most spectacular drives we have ever taken. You need to be careful though because the road is very narrow in many places and it requires the full attention of the driver to avoid hitting oncoming vehicles or the sheer rock walls along the way. My suggestion is to pull over at every pull off to enjoy the spectacular views. Warning...very few rest rooms along the way. The main one is about halfway along the Road to the Sun, and finding a parking space can be very difficult. ","August 16, 2015",Our favorite US national park,198,"Henderson, Nevada",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Yes, the road gets busy. YES, it is narrow and curvy and hard to navigate in spots right around Logan Pass.But the best thing to do? Arrive early at the Apgar Visitor Center and take the FREE shuttle bus! If you get there about 6:45 or so you will be able to get an express bus to Logan Pass! No one has to drive so no one misses out on the amazing views! AND, you don't have to worry about parking at Logan Pass, which usually fills totally up by 10 am or so. There are express busses from the Apgar Visitor Center at 7:00 am, 7:18 am, and 7:40 am. They each seat 15 people and go straight to Logan Pass. Not much traffic at that time so you will be amazed at how fast the shuttle drivers are able to go!Bus service from St. Mary starts around 9:00 am and goes to Logan Pass. It is slow because of construction, the fire, and the stops the bus is obliged to take. It is a much larger bus.It's much more scenic from Apgar to Logan Pass, and we did that three times, but only took the bus from St. Mary to Logan pass once.","August 15, 2015",Amazing Views!,80,"Russellville, AR",5

Stunning scenery, just hope not to get behind the red park buses--they go about 10-15 mph--very annoying! Two days later the entire road was opened so we got to see the fire damage. Two Dog flat was very cool and peaceful. The St Mary's entrance visitor center was lousy. I bought some souvenirs and they had run out of bags.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This is an amazing drive. I would suggest coming in from the East. I had very few cars around me, while I was passing trains of 20+ vehicles coming from the West. On the way out, the West entrance was backed up several miles. I had no issue coming in from the East and this made for a relaxing drive. In addition, there are a lot of nice places to stay around the East entrance.As a side note, coming from the East, you start high and descend, coming from the West, you start low and ascend. Also, most of the East drive you are along side the mountains, while the West drive puts you mostly on cliff edges. This is not a drive for the feint of heart. The road gets very narrow and high and it is important that you are a confident driver. The key idea here is empathy for those around you. If you have any doubts, ride in one of the free shuttles and allow someone else to drive you. Not even the fires and smoke could detract from the magic of Glacier National Park.

It can be a bit scary at times when you're on a particularly narrow part of the road, hugging the stone wall, and you get other traffic coming towards you. But the never-ending, magnificent vistas seemingly in every direction are priceless. We stopped at just about every pull-off to gawk at the incredible beauty. Breath-taking in many respects!

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Very over hyped, so everyone comes, and few cam enjoy. It's a nice drive, but hiking gives you far better views , too bad you can't do it as the few pull outs have very limited parking, and they are all full by 10 am!So what do you do - drive on by or cause traffic jams like some inconsiderate drivers do. Many of the limited spots are taken by hikers gone for a good part of thee day, so there's little hope. Access needs to be restricted, or better parking areas developed. Cars circling endlessly at the Logan pass parking lot creates back ups and environmental impact. Allow first in - first out, don't reward rude drivers with spotsOn top of that you pay a 25$ park use fee - but can't use the park, so ultimately you pay that for a one hour drive.

I had to walk an hour to the Apgar visitors centre to go on this tour. I was very upset by the time I reached the centre and only just made the bus.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Do it east to west. Start in St Mary's, and 95% of the drive you will be on the inside. If you need a round trip, head back east on Highway 2 which is a very easy, pleasant drive around the southern tip of the park. (But avoid highway 49 from East Glacier to St Marys which is much worse than Going to the Sun Road, because it has no guard rails and the pavement is in terrible condition. Instead, take highway 2 to Browning and 89 back to St. Marys, which is only about 6 minutes longer.)Seriously, GTTS road is not bad because there are stone railings, enough turnouts, and mainly because the traffic is going 20 - 30 mph on the bad parts.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"In our research about Glacier Park, we kept reading comments indicating that this road must be the most beautiful road in North America. I totally agree. It is an architectural marvel-how could it have been built in these mountains back in the 20's or whenever it was built? Parts of it are so narrow as to be gleefully scary. No large trailers are allowed-you can see why when you are there. There are turn offs very, very often, and you would do well to take advantage of them. Just a note, this is probably the best thing about Glacier National Park that you can get up close and personal with unless you are a hiker. But it is worth every mile of it. Second note it is the only road that will take you completely across the park.

Weather was great, the roads were excellent (lots of new pavement on there now) and, heck, going down the west side, I just turned the bike off and coasted down!Lots of very scenic views and they've done a good job of creating space for vehicles to pull over out of the way so as to get photos without obstructing traffic. Didn't see much wildlife on that day but, frankly, wasn't hoping to. I prefer my mountain roads ""Wildlife-Free"". anyway. :-) Some of the turns are quite tight for regular vehicles, which is why they don't let vehicles longer than (24? feet) on it.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Touring Glacier National Park and especially traveling on the Going to the Sun Road was one incredible trip. The Going to the Sun Road is not for anyone afraid of heights, for the road hugs the side of the mountain with steep cliffs on one side and no guard rails except for some large rocks here and there. The scenery along the road is spectacular, lots of mountains, waterfalls, wild goats, and bears. At the top of the Going to the Sun Road is Logan Pass where there is a visitor center and lots of trails. This is a very beautiful and scenic area. Some of the waterfalls were just incredible. We took the Red Bus tour which left from our hotel, this way I did not have to stop every time I wanted to take a picture. The Red Bus had windows on the side and the driver rolled the top back, so I could photograph from out of the top also.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"If you go to Glacier National Park and you're not intending to do Going-to-the-Sun, I'm not sure why you're going to the park. To me the real question is whether to drive it or take the park shuttle. We drove it and the main reason I'm convinced that was the right decision was because (a) we realized we stopped at numerous places along the way that the shuttle did not and (b) we continually saw people waiting to be picked up by the shuttle. The drawback is that you will likely have trouble parking at a couple of places, especially Logan Pass. The other place we had trouble was Avalanche Creek. But we did eventually get parking spots in both places.If you're into wildlife, there is a pullover near Logan Pass where mountain goats hang out. We saw one out as we were driving and stopped. There happened to be 4 others there. A mother goat and her two babies literally walked right up to my wife as if they were her pets. It was quite a memorable experience.We actually drove the road two different days (one was on our way to Many Glacier). One day we had rain, the next day we had sunny skies. Believe it or not, I think we liked the day it rained better because (a) it turned the waterfalls and creeks into something spectacular and (b) traffic was not horrible. The day we had sunny skies the congestion was significantly worse, in part because folks refused to drive more than 15 mph and would not pull over.If you don't get out of your car at least occasionally, you can't possibly be enjoying the park.","July 26, 2015",Drive the road rather than take the shuttle,134,"Fernandina Beach, Florida",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We drove the Going to the Sun Road on July 2, 2015. We were nervous it wouldn't be open and had been following from home before we left. Luckily it opened in mid/late June. It was beautiful. We pulled off many times to admire the views and take pictures. We stopped at Logan Pass - got there early enough to get a great parking spot - and did the hike to find the mountain goats. We hiked through snow patches and came upon the Hidden Lake overlook. It was beautiful and we were amidst a group of mountain goats. There were adults and 2 baby goats. They were so fun to watch. We spent about 30 minutes just watching them wander and play at the top of the overlook. We then headed back down. It was a great adventure. The rest of the Going to the Sun Road was as beautiful as the first half.","July 10, 2015",Great adventure inside Glacier National Park,41,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I understand trying to reduce traffic in a National Park (Zion NP does it very effectively) but our experience with the shuttle service in GNP was really a sorry experience. We parked at Agpar on the west side of the park. No signs directing to bus stop. We found it by asking a ranger how to get the bus to Logan Pass. He directed us. Only after letting two Avalanche Creek buses pass by did we learn that you HAD to take the AC bus and transfer to one for Logan Pass. This was not mentioned by the ranger (!) nor on the sign at the bus stop. Once we got to AC, and transferred to the Logan Pass bus we got where we wanted to go. But from arriving at Agpar to getting there took over two hours. Ride back was almost as frustrating. We stood in line for a spot on the 12-15 passenger shuttles back down. When it was finally our turn, the driver had to ""take a break"" because another shuttle wouldn't be along for awhile and if we left then, those behind us would have to wait too long. Think about this. It makes no sense at all. Those behind us were going to wait till the next shuttle arrived, regardless of when ours left. Essentially one of the service resources - ie a shuttle - was kept idle for what turned out to be a 20 minute ""break"". We decided it was because the driver wanted to delay his arrival back at Agpar until it was too late for him to make another round trip.Somebody has to take a long hard look at this operation and optimize on visitor trips / day or some other metric than what is apparently being used.","July 10, 2015",Glacier Park shuttle service,386,"Tucson, Arizona",2

What a drive!While the road presents numerous opportunities to stop and soak-in the outstanding scenery – snow-capped mountain peaks, lush green valleys, cascading waterfalls and meandering rivers, there are a few sights of note that set it apart. One such sight was the weeping wall – a short stretch of the road where water cascades over the side wall to create a thin veil of mist. It was an amazing feeling to drive through this stretch and feel the cool misty breeze.If you are a wildlife enthusiast like me, this road’s for you. We spotted a mountain goat and a black bear, but I overheard a lot of visitors who spotted grizzly bears and moose as well.

It was 80 degrees and no snow in sight. When further questioned the ranger said it was really because they were working on guardrail repair. Again Really??? It is very easy to use flagmen around worksite and enable one way traffic. I think they just hadn't staffed up yet for the summer and couldn't handle visitors yet. So sad that so many people missed a great drive. Also they had closed much of the parking near Avalanche Lake and it was a total zoo with people looking for parking.

The scenery is breathtaking - beautiful mountain views, snow covered mountains, gigantic waterfalls, lush greenery, and more!! There was some road construction so the pullouts from St. Mary's to Logan Pass were closed. We started early - about 7am - so we were able to take our time without lots of traffic behind us. We stopped at Logan Pass and hiked Hidden Lake trail. It was snow covered so we hiked through snow much of the way. It was fun! We also saw many mountain goats quite close which was great. We had a picnic lunch across from Avalanche Creek campground. What a great spot! Beautiful creek that you can wade in after lunch. We did part of this drive on a rainy/cloudy day too. We saw 2 black bears right on the road side. It was fun to see the mountains with cloud cover too, although doing the whole drive on a day like that would be a drag because you would is so much scenery.

Many of the pull offs were full so there was no stopping for picture taking or to just savor the view. Logan's Pass parking lot was full with each row having several cars waiting for a place to park so there was no stopping there either.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I can’t say enough about the majestic scenery of Glacier National Park. The Going-to-the Sun Road was built in late 1920’s to open the park up the general public. It is truly an engineering marvel and I can’t imagine how they did it with the technology of the time. The views are breath-taking, but be prepared, as the road is not designed for the faint-of-heart. It is a very steep, winding road and the builders must have assumed guard-rails were for sissies.

There are parts of this road where if you want to sight see, have someone else do the driving. I have traveled to the Himalayas, this road is comparable to some of the roads there. The scenery is stunning, breathtaking, spectacular and the road only adds to the splendor of the park. Watch for wildlife (and the wandering tourist) on roadways and blind curves. Use pulloffs to let the faster cars by, enjoy the scenery for minute longer as they zip by you. Do your research before you go.

At this time of year the road is not very crowded and you will see wildlife, mainly big horn sheep and mountain goats. Some will have their babies with them. Plenty of pull outs to take scenery or critter shots and ladies, there are plenty of bathrooms along the road (since it's 50 miles each way). Be sure you make your reservations early if you want to tour on the jammer buses. They book up quickly, no matter what month of the spring/summer.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This is a beautiful drive that starts (at the west end) with a long, lovely, cool lake. You drive a winding, nicely shaded road along a bright-blue, often white-water river with views of stunning peaks through the trees. Gradually you rise above the trees, with spectacular view of the snow-capped mountains, down to the wooded valleys below. There are many, many places to pull over and take pictures, and there are many, many vistas worth pulling over to do so. The road is narrow and winding at the top, with a cliff to one side and a rock wall with a steep drop-off on the other. This seemed to intimidate many, many people, and I was nearly hit repeatedly by people who couldn't stay in their own lane. I would recommend that fearful drivers go bowling or something instead. Once we began the descent going east, all pull-outs were closed for construction. This was unfortunate but necessary. I can go back another year to take pictures. The lake at that end was lovely, even stuck with no pull-outs to get a better view. I had my dog with me so we didn't hike any of the major trails along the way, but there are a few stops with short trails that we used to look at the river rapids and the lake.

Others drive so slowly they make the rest of us almost come to a complete stop. No one should be driving this in one of those humongous Winnebago-type campers. Your vehicle is too wide! Our small rental car was great on this narrow road. Do not expect to make this a quick drive. I found that if you chill, and just expect to go slowly, it can be a great experience.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This road is about 50 miles long and being in the mountains, there are curves and travel is slow especially if it is a busy day with lots of traffic. We actually went the first day, it was opened for 2015 and found the road itself was not crowded but a few of the stops were busy and parking was tight. You have views of mountains, glaciers, beautiful valleys, and waterfalls (probably earlier in the season than later). There are many places to stop or parking areas along the road and after a while, you find it would be impossible to stop at all of them. If you don't want to drive yourself, there are tour buses that will take you through it, although don't know how often they stop. Unfortunately, do to climate change there are only about 25 of 150 original glaciers left and by 2030, all are expected to disappear.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"If you ever get a chance to go on this road, it is a must! Although it does not seem to be open for much of the year - due to the extreme driving conditions, plowing and maintenance - this is a fabulous drive! For a $25 entry fee you gain access to drive all through Glacier National Park on the most stunning road I have ever seen. The views are spectacular, and the single lane road is in great condition. There are much needed guard rails along the entire track, and it feels like you are a mountain goat at times! There are a few different attractions to stop at along the way, including waterfalls, and trails. It took us about 3 hours to complete our journey headed West to East.One recommendation I would make is to be sure that you are travelling during daylight hours, and to make sure the sun will not be in your eyes (head West to East in the Morning or East to West in the evening).","June 30, 2015",Amazing Views,16,"Calgary, Canada",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We drove the Going to the Sun Road on June 25th. I don't like heights but was really glad we took this road. It is close to 50 miles long but the ""scarey"" high part is only 10-12 miles of this. We drove from the east to the west side and then back again. On the east side closer to Saint Marys the road is under alot of construction and so many of the pull outs are closed. On the west side many of the parking lots to take hikes were full and so we could not stop at many of them even though there is no construction going on. The free shuttle doesn't start until July lst and maybe that helps with the congestion in the parking areas every where you go. When we went on hikes we were at the trail heads no later than 8:30am to get a spot. Near the top there are alot of very tight curves, with a wall of stone on your right. There is no shoulder on the top by the road so it contributes to the narrow road. Just go slow and you will make it. If I could do it, anyone can! It was a beautiful day and the views were beautiful. If you plan on stopping at Logan Pass or any of the pull outs that are open you really need to go early in the day or later as Logan Pass is usually full by 10:00 am and stays that way until late afternoon. You can spend alot of time looking for a parking spot. Logan Pass Visitor's center is beautiful and is worth a stop. If you drive both ways and take time to stop and enjoy the trip - maybe eat lunch - plan on that being your main focus for the day.","June 30, 2015",Going to the sun road,134,"Denver, Colorado",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This was by far the most scenic and awe inspiring part of our 17 day road trip. We are so glad we decided to make the drive to this park in northern Montana as it provided us with one of a kind scenery and memories. Drive slowly and enjoy every minute of this park because these glaciers may be gone in our lifetime. Start your drive early and take some time to explore Logan Pass before all the crowds. We stopped there around 9:30am driving from the east entrance and on our way back at around noon there was zero parking in that lot. Spend the whole day on this road as every inch has a photo opportunity. Previous posts are correct as there are a lot of lookouts under construction, but there is still much to see and capture with pictures.The road can feel a bit narrow at times, but if you stay within the vehicle length and height guidelines you will manage just fine on this amazing road. It will be slow and crowded at times, but anticipating this will ease frustration. If you come across heavy traffic jams then it is probably wildlife very near the road as we had a chance to take pictures of a moose and a bear and her cub from the road.Highly recommend.","June 29, 2015",Go now!,74,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5

We saw moose, mule deer and rams, along with other assorted wildlife. The river on the west side is gorgeous. That said, don't expect the same beauty as Beartooth Highway and Beartooth Pass. That is the best! However, if you go to Glacier National Park and miss this road, you miss a lot!","June 29, 2015",Great views,92,"Newnan, Georgia",4

Going-to-the-Sun Road,This is a beautiful drive and one that you will want to take at different times of day. We waited until the 10th of June to visit to ensure all roads were open. It can take several hours to complete depending on where you want to stop. Our favorite time of day was duskish. Be sure to watch the sun set somewhere between Logans Pass and Heavens Peak. Stunning. Look up as you near Logans pass along the Highline trail - we spotted many goats and Bighorn sheep using guinea the trail around 8pm.Drive slow as we also saw many marmots and even a small black bear within sight of the road. Take a photo in front of the Continental Divide sign and if you have time do the hike to the observation point on the Hidden Lake Trail which starts at Logans Pass Visitor center. Many mountain goats. ,"June 29, 2015",Best National Park Drive,156,"Franklin, Massachusetts",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We visited just before the free shuttle began (July 1 each year) so the driver had to keep his eyes on the narrow road while his friends oohed and aahed at the unbelievable views. Still a little construction going on at the east end which is wiping out some pull-off points, but traffic wasn't too bad in mid-June. And maybe the shuttle will keep congestion down, too. Parking sometimes tough to find, even at the big lot at Logan's Pass. But this is pretty much the only road through the park connecting most of the hikes. We didn't try hooking up with any other roads, though it depends where you are, of course.

Neat the summit of the pass is where you might get the chance to see bighorn sheep and mountain goats. In June of 2012 we saw two Rams in the parking lot at Logan Pass Visitor center. Also in 2012 just pass the tunnel east of the visitor center we saw 3 mountains goats. In June of 2015 we saw a mountain goat at the first pull out west of Logan Pass.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,We read the reviews on Tripadvisor and heeded all the warnings etc.....meaning it's popular and can be crowded. We Camped on the East end and we were up and on the road at 6:45am. This time of year they were doing Road Construction so we figured that into going early and that worked perfect. It was a nice morning and it was very nice driving along almost by ourselves. All the view points and turnouts were empty etc. We took our time and took plenty of pictures. We had plans to down around the bottom of the park over to the West entrance so after going about 3/4 of the way we turned around and headed back east. The Sun was a little higher in the morning sky so it made for nice pictures too ! On the way back we stopped at the visitor center at Logan Pass and it was 3/4 full already and as we drove east lots of late sleepers were going west....lots of them including the Red Bus Tours. I was driving our small Class B Motorhome and even though the roads in some points are very narrow you are going slow so it's easy to slow down even more if another vehicle is squeezing past....I didn't think it was bad at all.

The road is narrow and hugs the mountain tightly with lots of hair pin curves and the drops are never ending of the road. There are stone barriers between mountain and drops but DRIVER needs to be very careful and pay attention to road and not views.I highly recommend to stop at Logan's Pass and to hike up to Hidden Lake.

(motel;shops;restaurants;camping).Taking a right turn, you will be traveling thru the forest alongside Lake McDonald. The next place of interest would be Lake McDonald Lodge (hiking, boating; or riding The DeSmet on the Lake)After leaving the Lodge the next area of interest would be the Trail of the Cedars by Avalanche Creek,(walking trail).Then you just enjoy the drive and watch for the many areas to pullout, because on every turn there is a picture waiting to be taken. Logan Pass is the summit and there is always an animal to capture in your sights. You will pass by the ""Weeping Walls"" where the melting snow showers the roadway and you if you have your windows down.Be sure you get out of your car and take the short walk at ""Sunrift Gorge"" .

Please, pay attention to the signs, and the Rangers, and to common sense! This isn't a zoo!Oh, and DO take a hike or two off the road on one of the hiking trails.

Since the park is largely closed for much of the year due to snow, it isn't visited as much as some parks, but the scenery here is absolutely transcendent. Going-to-the-Sun Road is one of the most beautiful - if sometimes harrowing - drives in America. Mountains, waterfalls, and sometimes mountain goats and low-lying mist make for stunning pictures. This road is the way to many of the great hikes in the park, as well.Yes, the road is narrow in places and has a shear drop. If you're concerned about driving it yourself, please take advantage of one of the classic red jammer buses.I always tell friends from other parts of the country, ""Go to Yellowstone for the wildlife.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We drove the ""Going to the sun road"" travelling from Waterton Lakes in Canada down to Whitefish Montana. The scenery is spectacular and there are some fantastic hiking trails. I can't remember the name of the trail but it led up a lot of wooden stairs to a beautiful ""hidden"" lake and I believe the trail head was at the summit of the mountain. Anyway, it was about a 3 mile trail and it was quite steep, but the views of the hidden lake were very well worth it. If you don't want to drive this mountainous road with a lot of hairpin bends and very narrow, then you can join a driving tour to the Going to the Sun Road using the touring Company in the park. The cars they use look like a lot of fun: they seat about 20 people and are bright red and they can also lower the Roof in good weather. So you have all the fun, but don't have to worry about the driving. When we got down to lower ground it's easy driving through the park. We were lucky to see several blackbears near the side of the road.

The drive from west to east was terrifying because I was in the passengers seat and inches away from the edge. I almost had a panic attack within the first 10 minutes. However, once we got out of the car (there are TONS of places to stop) I was fine. The drive back was super easy because I knew what to expect. I almost didn't want it to end!

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I think this may be the most beautiful place I have ever been. The road in itself is an engineering marvel - it literally is built into the side of the mountains. The mountains looks like something you would imagine seeing in Switzerland. There are waterfalls around almost every turn, the road is designed to have the waterfalls built into it - there are grates that allow the water to fall down through the road and not across the road. The Weeping Wall was one of my favorite parts of the road - a long length of the road that is a continuous waterfall. The water falls on to your car and it can only be described as ""magical"".There is wildlife everywhere - near Logan pass we encountered big horn sheep and mountain goats. The bighorn sheep was so close we could have reached out and touched it. We even saw a grizzly bear cross the road in front of us. You will still see snow in the summer, too. It was July when we went and there was still a lot of pretty deep snow in several areas.Bring lunch with you if you want to eat, because there are no restaurants once you get going. It took us between 2-4 hours to drive the road each way - we stopped a lot. The Logan Pass parking lot was always pretty full, and we always had to drive around and stalk people walking back to their cars to get a parking spot.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We arrived in Glacier two days before this road closed for the season, and it was well worth the effort to get there. There are no words to describe the beauty of this road. We drove from the St. Mary's Entrance to the West Entrance, and in my opinion that's the better way to drive. There are a plethora of reviews attesting to the beauty of this road, so I won't elaborate on the beauty; you'll get that experience for yourself. I do have three tips:1. Go Early - The peak hours in terms of visitors are Noon - 3 pm. Get in the park early so its not as crowded and not as hot. You can get easier access to the views and the few restrooms along the path. 2. Go Slow - You will take dozens of pictures, especially in the early morning and evening when the light is more dynamic. Every curve along the route is picturesque to an almost absurd degree. Give yourself a full day to travel, as it will take all that time if you enjoy beautiful landscapes. 3. Go Have Fun - Get out of your car and explore, and not just the paved pathways. There are several marked trails, but also lots of hidden trails that lead to the greatest gems the park has to offer. You won't get the best experience unless you take a chance and hike around. Another fun tip: fill your water bottles in the streams. The water is perfectly clear and tastes wonderful.

Trying to avoid crowds we were here in Sep. and unfortunately the going to the sun road was closed due to ice and whiteout conditions. Talking to others at the visitors center confirmed that this happens alot. Several others said that the last time they were here the road was closed. We still enjoyed the brief amount of the park we saw and the scenery on Hwy 2 on our way to Great Falls was spectacular. I feel a part of road tripping is dealing with hiccups, and moving on to not let it get you down. Glacier (Like ALL National parks) is worth as much time as you can give it, I had little.

This tour was well worth the ticket price not only for the historical information provided by our driver Benny, but we were both able to enjoy the views without worrying about the tight curves in the road. We only had one five minute construction delay and the traffic wasn't bad...probably because of going in mid-September. My only complaint was with Logan Pass's lack of open bathroom facilities and the resulting long lines for the port-a-potties. There were frequent enough bathroom stops at other lodges on our day long tour, so it wasn't too much of an inconvenience. We had lunch at the Ptarmigan Dining Room at Many Glacier Hotel...a table at the window with a million dollar view and food better than it had to be.

The road is very curvy and tight with two way traffic. Can't imagine what it's like in peak season. We went in September and the crowds weren't too bad- but enough to cause someone afraid of heights to drive closer to the yellow line than the white. The views along this road are amazing! If your not afraid of heights be sure to look down and see just how vast the landscape is before you. This road brought us right to many glacier hotel to start our trip on Grinell Glacier trail, and the views were fantastic the whole drive. There is no stop for gas or food on this route so be sure you've got plenty of gas to travel.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Driving the Going-to-the-Sun Road was an incredible experience. We did the drive in the EB direction and then the WB direction a few days later. If your itinerary allows I recommend this, as we appreciated different views when driving in each direction. As an example, we must have been distracted by the road work near the Siyeh Bend as we only saw the incredible Jackson Glacier on the way back. The first drive was sunny; the second, while cloudy, provided some neat views as the clouds interacted with the mountain peaks. Great places to stop and hike include Avalanche Creek and Logan Pass (if you can get a parking spot). Don't miss the views of Bird Woman Falls and Mt. Oberlin across the valley. Allow plenty of time- with stops it'll be a multi-hour experience. Use US2 if you have to get from one end of the park to the other with a minimum of distraction (but with a lot less scenery!). Be prepared to wait for road work. With constant wear from traffic and the elements and the road being snowbound most of the year, there's really no choice but do to the work in the height of summer.Other reviewers seem to have the sights and Red Buses well covered so I thought I would discuss the driving itself. Impressions I've read seem to run the full range from ""terrifying"" to ""no problem"". I'd heard there were a lot of sections with sheer drop-offs because of damage to guard rails from avalanches and the like. Although I'm an East Coaster with only a handful of mountain driving experiences, I was at ease during most of the drive. I considered Crater Lake's Rim Road much more nerve-wracking in comparison. Even on sections when I was driving on the outside of the curve from the Loop to St. Mary's Lake, there was almost always a guard rail of stone or heavy timber. Furthermore, the speed limit drops from as high as 45MPH at the lower elevations of the road to 35MPH, even 25MPH in some hairpin sections. The speed limits always seemed appropriate. My only concern was other drivers- it was alarming about two or three times on the drive when nervous drivers in oncoming traffic began to enter my lane. It was especially surprising given that they were on the mountain side of the road, not the cliff side, which I'd assumed would be scarier. I can only speculate that those low hanging rock walls seemed too close. The solution for that is the old driver's ed lesson to keep your eyes centered further down the road. I was amazed by how many drivers rode their brakes on the downhill slope when shifting to second or third gear would have kept them at the speed limit without having to use their brakes much. My basic impression was the road was perfectly safe for drivers who take care; still the overturned motorcycle we spotted near East Tunnel was a reminder that the road may be unforgiving. If you're nervous, just take your time (but use the turnouts to let faster traffic by!). Or if this kind of road is outside your comfort zone, simply take the free shuttles (in season), Jammer Bus, or simply drive US 2 (as a last resort).","September 15, 2014",A drive like no other,97,"Newark, Delaware",5

Take a picnic and stop at one of the many picnic spots - especially Lake McDonald. And go for a swim in a glacier lake.Cannot wait to go back and explore more.

Oh, then we arrived east of Logan's Pass at the construction sites. Yuck! We never waited more than 10 minutes, but the mud and rock were not much fun. Another couple at our B & B drove east to East Glacier, then up to Going to the Sun Road late in the day for the return to Whitefish. They said the traffic was very light in the late afternoon.

The driver gave us some great information on the area. This part of the trip was not scary, as j had read in some reviews. I almost didn't go because I thought the road was bad and extremely curvy. This was not the case at all. I never got scared. I am so glad I took the tour. I can't say what the trip is like from Logan's pass to the west side of Glacier.

Lake McDonald and Lake Saint Mary are both beautiful. Don't miss the Trail of the Cedars. There is parking by the picnic area as well. There are so many turn outs worth turning out for. There are several nice hikes, both long and short. There is also a fairly long area that is under construction.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I'm a bit skittish when it comes to mountain drives, but we're in Glacier and we had to drive this. Unfortunately there was a snow storm the night before our visit so the road was closed at Logan Pass. We were not able to drive the entire road.The road has many turns and high cliffs, but the sections where there are cliffs also had guard walls. You can't drive off, which is what I'm always afraid of. I'm one of those. you drive slowly and there are many pull out sections where you can get on your feet, take a breath, and take in the scenery. We started from West Glacier. Beautifully drive. Not full of RVs like other parks. Not sure if RVs are even allowed on Going to the Sun Road.Take this trip, bring lunch so that you can sit out and enjoy the view and the fresh air.The next day we drove in from the East side. How many pictures am I supposed to take? Each turn in the road gives a vista that cannot be described. The blue lakes with the mountain behind and glaciers and blue sky... if the pass is closed do drive around and take in both sides.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"First - RED BUS themselves - Cute and Historic yes, canvas tops fold back to allow views of tall peaks. Drivers decide if the top is open. Some people wanted the top up some didn’t, depending on where they sat and who had the good seats etc. The ones who did not want the top down had the best seats in the bus front and side windows. And the driver almost gave in to them even though the majority wanted the top off. Now the seating! Oh yes - I forgot to mention if you give a “Large” enough “TIP to the DRIVER” before hand you can get the front seat for the entire day, that’s right and they do not rotate seats. The windows are small so if you get stuck in the middle of a seat or past row two you will have a hard time seeing if the top is not open. Third - There is no doubt guides can make the difference no matter where you go. And traffic will be a problem because of the road repair that is required every year after winter. So due to the amount of time we had to spend sitting in traffic. Our driver made it up by not stopping at scenic pull outs or to see the wild life! When some one question her about our not stopping, she said we are not suppose to stop there or it’s against the law, that was funny we saw other Red Buses stopped. And the driver said over and over “I have to have “ MY GIRL” {the bus} back by a certain time. That is all our driver wanted to talk about “HER GIRL” the red buses. It was good to hear about them but not all day long. Wanted to hear more about the area etc.What was so amazing after talking with several others at the lodge that night. Many of them had similar experience on the red busses they were on. One couple said there was a very heated argument over seats and the top being open and the driver took it with a grain of salt and said it happens a lot.The only reason to take the bus is if you do not want to drive the curvy Going-to-the-Sun road. But after talking with others , who also did a Red Bus tour, you will have to comprise and have some of the problems I just mentioned.Be prepared for warm you will need sunscreen and hats or Cold you will need heavy jackets.

If you just don't like the mountain driving on a very narrow road with deep valleys on one side and steep mountains on the other consider the shuttle. There are a few places to stop and get out along the side so the driver has a chance to check out the views. There was some construction when we were there in late August but the delays were short.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We started on the West Side (Lake McDonald) and drove to the East Side (Many Glacier).Loved Going to the Sun Road. The views are spectacular. We got to see a black bear when we stopped at an overlook just past the loop. He just came wandering up the slope, crossed the road and up the next hill. No interest in us at all. We stopped at Logan's Pass. The parking lot was full as it was about 12 noon. We went past the lot and parked on the road (as others were doing). We hike back to Logan's Pass and did a little 3 mile hike to the Hidden Lake Overlook.It was very busy but still peaceful as the views are spectacular. The meadows were blooming with lots of wildflowers. Lots of small wildlife: ground squirrels, marmoths, etc. We also saw two small herds of goats. They were close enough to watch for a while.Construction stopped us for about 15-20 minutes.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Getting there early really helps. On busy weekends like Labor Day weekend, parking lots fill up real fast , and by afternoon , so do many of the pull outs by the side of the road. Also, if one happens to get stuck behind an inexperienced driver ( like we did ) who drives extremely slow around every one of the curves on this very curvy and ( at times) narrow road , then one can do little except inch along for many miles. What made this stick out for us was it was our 3rd time on this road in two days and we were on our way back from Many Glacier back to West Glacier There are portions of the road past Logan's Pass ( when driving towards St Mary's) that are semi unpaved which in rainy weather cause visibility issues from muck and grit thrown back from the vehicle in frontHaving said all that, the views are plentiful and stunning.

Not having seen much on it we only did the ride and then went on to our destination for the evening.

That is for a very good reason, the highway is extremely narrow with some very sharp switch backs and curves! The drive which is around 50 miles will likely take you 3 hrs because on most of the drive will average 30 miles an hour & you won't want to travel any faster, not only because of the careful driving you will be required to do. But also you will want to soak in the stunning scenery!! Great drive & scenery! Lots of pull off so you can stop and take pictures. Unfortunately the highway had some construct in a couple spots, so some delays! Try not to be the driver, make sure you takeLots of pictures & video!

There were frequent pull out areas so that was nice. The only drawback was the road construction on the East end of the part which caused delays and some of our planned parking spots were closed, but I understand the road need to be maintained there too! We were on the road at 7am in order to make a couple stops and get to Logan Pass before the parking lot was full. Our plan worked and we were able to stop and hike Trail of Cedars plus part of Avalanche Creek, then Hidden Lake Overlook and part of the trail to Hidden Lake, then on to the waterfalls were we saw Barking Falls, St. Marys Falls and Virginia Falls. It was a long day but very rewarding by all the places we got to see and hike plus the wildlife we encountered.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The single most amazing thing we've ever seen. Terrifying to drive at parts, but oh so worth it. This road takes 2.5 hours ONE WAY and is the only direct way from east to west glacier. The alternative is to leave the park and drive around (2hr). So, if you are staying on one side and want to hike on another, plan to be be in the car! We stopped at apgar village on our way for firewood, but coming from fish creek to apgar is confusing- there's no sign. Buy your gas before you get to east or west glacier outside the park, we saw $0.80 / gallon higher there than just a few miles away! The day we left we saw rangers post on facebook that there had been northern lights visible during our trip - we didn't even know that could happen and were disappointed that we missed them! Our campground was probably too wooded to have seen them anyway, so if you are looking you'll need to visit the lakes.

The only thing that could have made it nicer would have been if we could have taken our time driving through the park, but the road was so busy that day and a lot of the people that were going through the park were in such a big hurry to get through it that were tail gated a lot, honked at and that wasn't very pleasant we felt like we needed to speed up as well.

Incredible scenery, impressive and historic road architecture. Be prepared to take your time, stop often to soak up the views. And if you are sensitive about heights or exposure, think twice about this trip. Fortunately, most drivers on this road take a leisurely approach and enjoy the ride. The road is narrow, and most wide vehicles are banned (no Winnebagos! Hooray!). But even in our compact car, we found certain turns very tight when other vehicles were passing the other direction. Fun, so long as other drivers are behaving like civilized human beings. Unfortunately, the parking lot at Logan Pass fills up by mid morning in the summer high season, and the trails there become a zoo. But there are other places to pull over and take a breather. We did see some people walking along the road itself, but that looked like a really bad idea.Some of our friends have bicycled the road, and say that it is an incredible cycling experience. However, park rules limit when cyclists can ride the road. For those with good driving skills, calm nerves and basic manners, driving Going to the Sun road can be a world class experience. For others, there is an option: the free hiker shuttles, or the red ""jammer"" buses that you can ride for a cost. Note: because of heavy snowpack, this road typically does not open until mid summer.

We started in Apgar and went up to Logan's Pass expecting to do a hike, but there was too much snow (2nd week in July). We did all the stops on the way back to Apgar, including Trail of the Cedars (which reminded me so much of being in the Pacific NW). The next day we drove it on the way to Many Glacier and just focused on the east side. There was a lot of road work on the east side which meant delays and made parking for hikes really difficult. The road was dirt for most of it and it was definitely not as enjoyable. I'd recommend you get a map of where to stop and where the hikes are.

I think the route is best going from West to East but it's great in either direction. Try to go early if you can -- before 8 am -- as the road quickly gets crowded. Right now, there is construction on the east side between Sayegh Bend and St. Mary's, but is easily passable in a car. You might experience a few delays though.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We drove the GTTS road twice - once in each direction. It is especially beautiful going from the east to the west after Logan's Pass. Pay attention to the vehicle restrictions because there are places where you are caught between a rock (on the wall side) and a hard place (cars going in the opposite direction with little room for error).Clouds rolled in as we attempted to drive half of it again and the whiteout was terrifying - so much so that we found a place to turn around and go back down. We are used to driving in the mountains, but when you can't see 10 feet in front of you and there is no forgiveness if you make a mistake it's an uncomfortable feeling.Nevertheless, this is one of the most gorgeous drives I have ever seen. If you are in GNP it is a must do and you'll remember the views for a long time. The views from St. Mary's to Logan's Pass are pretty, but there is quite a bit of road construction that will cause at least a 30 minute delay (summer of 2014). The views from Logan's Pass to Lake McDonald are stunning.The Hidden Lake Overview hike at Logan's Pass is the one hike that you should do if you don't do any others. You're almost guaranteed to see mountain goats UP CLOSE and the view of the lake at the end of the hike is most rewarding. Note that parking at Logan's Pass is extremely tight.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Everyone told us we had to do the Going to the Sun Road trip. It's 50 miles long and takes about 2 hours if you stop and take pictures and look at the views….and they are breathtaking. We went the middle of August so there was no snow but you could still see the incredible glaciers, I can only imagine how incredible it would be in the fall or winter. The first problem we had was the road construction near the entrance to the West Entrance…..2 of the most spectacular views were not seen because of it. The other problem which I guess is a necessary evil and also kind of a tradition there are those long red buses for the tourist. They were everywhere and very hard to maneuver around. On the plus side we did see a black bear, and a fox! Overall, I agree the Going to the Sun Road should not be missed!!","August 20, 2014",Beautiful views!,13,"Nashville, Tennessee",4

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"My mom and I were so excited to come to GNP and drive on this road, but I have to say we both left disappointed...I know you have to go OFF the road for even better scenery, but we were not able to do that this time. The drive would have been so much better if there was not so many trees obstructing the view driving on this road! And on the parts you could see, I would break out into a sweat because you drive right next to a drop off. It was nauseating. But those views were pretty. We saw zero wildlife except a couple of mountain goats on the way back to west glacier. If you have a day to spare, take hwy 2 around GNP. The views are so much better and we saw so much more wildlife! What made our trip worth it was the helicopter tour of GNP through Glacier Heli Tours.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Going to the Sun Road has great views for the passengers, but hard for the driver to enjoy so I would encourage using the free shuttle. The road is very busy and parking spots after mid-morning become hard to find which is another reason to take the shuttle. We found the shuttles from West Glacier to Logan Pass to run much more often and consistently than the shuttles from St. Mary's to Logan Pass. Going to the Sun road is a must Glacier National Park experience, but it is just the beginning of an incredible nature adventure.

If you get up early enough you may skip the crowds and see more wildlife.My favorite stops were the Bridal Woman Falls lookout (we later climbed Mt Oberlin - highly recommended), Weeping Wall, St Mary Lake (in the morning for postcard worth photos) and the Logan Pass section.There are not many options in the way of food so make sure to pack enough for the day ahead.Enjoy!","August 11, 2014",Too Good to Only Drive Once!,33,"Whistler, Canada",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We drove the road from East to West, stopping at the visitors center on top at Logan Pass. We started early, to miss the bulk of tourist traffic, and that was a good idea. Of course, it's understandable that a road like this would take a lot of maintenance, especially after winter snows, so expect some road crews to be out doing the work. I could go on and on about the spectacular views and vistas, but my descriptions wouldn't do it justice; this is one you'll just have to do yourself to fully appreciate. While you're touring the rest of the park, I recommend a stop at the historic inns and lodges therein.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We only had one day to explore Glacier NP, so we stuck with the obvious and drove the Going-to-the-Sun Road. We were not disappointed. Despite our late start (leaving Whitefish at 10:30am), we still experienced a lot of the park, and returned to our lodge over 12 hours later in the dark with memories of our trip to last a lifetime.First, the crowds: the road was busy, but manageable, even in the height of the summer tourist season (we visited in late July 2014). We found plenty of space for all of the pullouts we wanted to stop at, and we took the advice of our innkeeper to keep circling the lot at Logan Pass; as it turns out, we found a family walking back to their car on our first circuit, made eye contact to confirm that they were leaving, and then followed them to their vehicle. Total time in the parking lot: two minutes. Even if the parking lot sign says full, I recommend you circle it and stalk folks walking back to their cars, as people leave all the time.From Logan Pass, we hiked up to the Hidden Lake Lookout, and the views were spectacular, and we saw ground squirrels, marmots, mountain goats (some of them coming down the path), chipmunks, ravens, and bighorn sheep. An amazing hike which we will remember for a very long time.Back at the visitor center (where we got our NP passport booked stamped), took off to hike the first portion of the Highline Trail on the advice, again, of our innkeeper. Wow! After descending through an alpine meadow with amazing views down the valley back the way we came, the trail hugs a cliff face a couple of hundred feet above the roadway. Keep your hand on the cable handrail attached to the rock face, as the narrow (10' wide) trail has a sheer drop down to the roadway. Not an experience for those with vertigo, but we loved it. After a half mile or so, we doubled back to the pass (we saw mountain goats both ways).Our next stop was to hike to the falls on the western end of St. Mary Lake. We saw both doe and buck whitetail deer, and the falls (we hiked far enough to see four or five spectacular cascades) were beautiful. We ended our time in the park with a stop for some amazing pie (at the Park Cafe, in St. Mary), and then drove the long road on the southern end the park back to Whitefish.What a day! It was long, but memorable in so many ways.","August 10, 2014","As advertised: a spectacular, beautiful, can't miss experience",387,"Lynnwood, Washington",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,Great trip! The road is a little scary in areas but the views are breath taking. Go early or expect traffic.

It is impossible to describe with words the beauty and magnificence of these incredible mountains; the peace you experience there and the tiny you can feel in front of such immense creation.

Drivers were very polite, not crowding you if you slowed down. The GPS map in my car showed the incredible loop ahead, so I could understand that we were traversing a mountain side like a goat would.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"What spectacular views on this highway! We were just driving through on this trip, but in the past took our time and made it into a day long outing. Going from the east gate, for about the first 9 miles, there is road construction so the drive is on gravel roads and very slow. The whole road is about 50 miles and there are several places including Logan Point to stop, take picutres and just enjoy the views. There is a $25 park pass fee, per car, which is good for a week. It can be tricky driving in several places as the roads are narrow, winding, right next to cliffs, no shoulders and steep drop offs at high altitudes. So, if you do get queasy, it might be wise to take the red bus or the park shuttles. But, most drivers do go slow. It takes about 2 hours to get to the end.

At the Visitor's Center you will usually see mountain goats and a herd of Big Horn Sheep. The goats will be out in the open; however, you have to look a little harder for the Big Horns. They are usually at the base of the mountain across the highway from the Visitor's Center. We saw eleven of them this trip alone.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Loved this drive right from the start. Being my first time in GNP I didn't know totally what to expect. I've driven on many odd roads in CO & CA so wasn't too worried. IF you can't stay in your lane due to fears of the drop off or the rock wall PLEASE don't drive it for the safty of others. The lanes are not much wider then the cars, or so it seems. There are several blind curves and you never know what is around them. I like to bicycle myself but you'd never catch me doing this road on a bike, but many do and it adds to the challenge of not causing an accident. There are many pull-outs along the way where you can stop and let others pass, if needed, or step out and take great photo's! IF you have a fear of heights or being unable to handle the drive they offer a few options instead. There are small tour buses or the 'Jammers'. But if you have a fear of going over the edge it may not help you. The road has very sturdy rock wall or heavy wood rails along the road. Some places there may be fallen rocks or water may splash onto the road from the falls. Some distance beyond Logan Pass they were doing road work and the delays were kind of long, FYI...late July.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Going to the Sun Road is a must see. I think it is better than the alps and a national treasure. We visited on July 31, 2014. I would include Going to the Sun road on any road trip out West. We thought it was super nice. I was traveling with a 12 year old and 16 year old. They are constantly complaining. However you can tell they are into the place when they ask you to stop and let them take pictures or to get out and see things. They loved the road.I would like to thank the nice lady from Napa valley who was spending her birthday in the park who gave us traveling advice for the road. We were worried about our RV on the road but it was just fine. However I would not drive a land yacht on the road. Our RV is a 22 foot class A. If you drive from West to East it is even less of a problem because you on the outside lane.I wanted to visit the welcome center at Logan's Gap but the parking lot was completely full with people waiting for a space. I am glad we had our RV because a park employee had actually broke down just East of the Logan Pass and we were able to pull him backwards uphill to safety because we have a front hitch (for putting a boat in tight spaces). There was a lot of construction but I think it is because the weather gets rough up there. I also wonder why there is a dirt section of the road on the East side, or is that because of construction? Also the park has a free shuttle and if I had to choose between the red buses and the free park shuttle I would take the shuttle. We were traveling across the country so it was better for us to enter on the West side and leave on the East side for travel purposes. Thus the shuttle did not work for us. I stopped at a nice campground on the West side of the road but it was packed.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,Going To The Sun road was a bucket list item and it is finally checked off. This is the most spectacular drive in America. Right up there with Grand Teton and the Beartooth Highway. We drove from St. Mary to Logan Pass the first day we camped out. Our campsite was at Rising sun campground thirteen miles into the road. We did several hikes off this road including a great one to St. Mary Falls. The kids enjoyed going to Logan Pass and playing in the snow in July as well as seeing the Bighorn Sheep on the rocky slopes above the pass. We drove the rest of Going To The Sun Road our last day in Glacier. The scenery is amazing and some of the hairpin turns are exhilarating. There are photo ops everywhere and most get better the further you go along the road. Waterfalls are plenty. Incredible views Of St. Mary and Avalanche Lake. There are turnouts with signage and more incredible scenery. The first twenty or so miles are under construction right now until you get to Logan pass. There are sections of road that are just one lane and wait times can be upwards of close to an hour at peak times. The road is also dusty unless it has rained or you are lucky enough to get behind a spray truck. There are lots of bicyclers to watch out for too. We saw a good bit of wildlife from the road but you really need to get out and hike Glacier for the wildlife. There are good views of Jackson Glacier from Going To The Sun road. There are bathroom facilities at the campsites and Logan pass along the way. We enjoyed hiking the west side of Glacier too and stopped by several creeks and waterfalls off the road for a little relaxation before exiting the park in West Glacier. They are price gouging gas at St. Mary before you enter the park. It was over $4 when the rest of Montana was still around $3.75. You don't have any other options though and you may need a full tank if you plan on making the return trip.

It may be hard to find spots in the pull-off areas along the side of the road in the most scenic spots. The road gets windy on some areas but never unsafe, though I wouldn't take an RV on them. Even if you aren't staying in the park, merely passing though, this is a road you should drive! Absolutely recommend! ","August 2, 2014",A must-see!,35,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Must do in life! Whole road from west to east will normally take you a few hours minimum with stops a little longer....but with the massive construction going on to rebuild after a hard winter it too almost 5 hours just one way. As you head from West to East you will find cool trails to explore (the best things inside Glacier NP are in the east, unless staying inside the NP the accommodation options outside the park are better in the west). Get an early start as mid-day the road gets congested with fellow travelers and make sure you have a full tank of gas. They actually have a pull out named for picnics about halfway between and views from the spot are exceptional...bring food with you if you want to picnic as there is little you will find to buy inside the middle of the park. Our return trip was near sunset so crowds had thinned and that made the drive nicer.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"In good weather at least this is an amazing road giving access into the mountains with outstanding views, but because of steep drops alongside the road I know some drivers and their passengers can be worried. Try not to be. From East to West the for the majority of the time you will be on the opposite side of the road to the drops, but you will be near the rocky cliffs that run alongside the road. Also you will have to pull across to the far side to stop in the turnouts to admire the view. From West to East you will be alongside the drop off but able to pull straight into the turnouts.The road is steep at times, but nothing a regular car will have problems with. The road can be twisty and narrow giving the driver not a lot of space to play with. The yellow line in the centre of the road is your best friend. By staying close to it (but not crossing it) you can be sure that your car will not be too near the edge or the cliff.Going downhill it is a good idea to use low gears to save the brakes, so if you are in an unfamiliar rental car it is wise to find out how to shift into a low gear before starting the descent.For me the biggest problem was other drivers either desperate to find a parking spot or so enjoying the view that they stopped or pulled out without thinking about other traffic.Take it smooth and slow and you should have a great time driving one of the most scenic roads in North America.","July 31, 2014",Going to the Sun Road for nervous drivers,458,"Eastbourne, United Kingdom",5

We drove the Road twice - once in the afternoon, with full sunshine on the mountains, and once at sunset. Both times were unforgettable. My best advice is to drive it as many times as you can, at different times of the day, and see what else you didn't notice the last go around. I also recommend taking a look at the Visitor's Center's history of how the road was built - it will blow your mind.","July 29, 2014",Worth doing again and again,25,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida",5

During our visit (July 2014) there was a lot of road work on the eastern side of the road, and many of the good views back up the lake were blocked off. Still, this is an absolutely stunning road, and we felt blessed to be there.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The Going to the Sun Road is open only 3-4 months a year (during summer) so plan accordingly. Not only was the entire road breathtakingly beautiful, there are several attractions and short hikes along the road that shouldn't be missed! Driving on the road might seem daunting but it is reasonably safe as long as you stick to the speed limits and are mindful of the twists and turns. We started from the west, making Lake MacDonald our first stop. Make sure you take time out to go out onto the lake. There are kayaks and paddle boats available for rent. The road then rapidly climbs and meanders through the mountains. Stop at The Loop to get a scenic panoramic view of the forests, mountains and waterfalls. Continuing ahead, you'll reach Logan Pass, the highest point on the road (6647 feet). The Logan Pass visitor center is where the trail for the one of the most beautiful lakes in the park begins: Hidden Lake. We visited early July when there was still a substantial amount of snow but that made the 4 mile round trip hike even more enjoyable! Spotted plenty of mountain goats on the way. Past Logan Pass, the road climbs downwards. Don't miss the Jackson Glacier viewpoint, where you can see one of the few glaciers remaining in the park. Another must-see vista is the Wild Goose Island, which sits pretty in Saint Mary Lake. We chose to spend the night at the Rising Sun campground at the Northeast end of the road, which is a good idea if you want to explore the Many Glacier area of the park the next day.

Couldn't have been better. We had our puppy along, so couldn't do much hiking but next time he'll be in daycare and we'll make a day of hiking!

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The Going to the Sun Road was quite a scenic adventure. It is approximately 50 miles of narrow winding road. Several miles of the middle section of the road are right on the edge of the world, with rock on one side and a huge drop-off on the other. It wasn’t particularly difficult, and it is relatively safe, if you stay in your own lane, obey the speed limit, and stop the car in a pull out if you’re planning on looking around. When you get out of your car, be sure to stay out of the traffic lanes, and don’t take chances by the drop-off edge! The road could be a challenge for people who don’t like driving next to drop-offs. If you’re only going one direction, the east to west seemed a little less intimidating for the height-conscious driver. We observed many people on big motorbikes, and that looked like the ideal way to view the area. There are limits on the length and width of vehicles over some parts of the road, so check the National Park website for specifics. Shuttle buses, and vehicles called “Red Jammers” are alternatives if you’re travelling in a larger vehicle. There were sections of construction, where they are improving the road and view areas, which caused minor delays. One view area we very much wanted to visit was not available because of the construction, but this was only a minor inconvenience.The views of mountains, valleys, waterfalls, plants & animals, etc. are all absolutely stunning. Around each bend was another breathtaking scene. Right along the road were amazingly tenacious plants sprouting out of the cracks in the rocks. Waterfalls that come down the mountain and under the road were frequent and beautiful. One area called ""Weeping Rock"" features waterfalls that come right onto the road—so close that sunroof when you get there!! Many long waterfalls grace the opposite side of the valleys as well. Part of the road is also along the lively and beautiful McDonald Creek (more like a river than a creek) and there are numerous pullouts along that section as well. A number of trailheads, including the popular Logan Pass Visitors’ Center and trailheads, are accessed from the Going-to-the-Sun road. There are two short tunnels along the route. All in all, this was an amazing and beautiful drive. We stopped to take lots of pictures and just soak up the views. I also took some pictures from inside the car while my husband drove. There is no fee for the road, beyond the national park admission. I don’t recall seeing any stores, gas stations, or other services between the Rising Sun Lodge, where we stayed, and Lake McDonald. There were restrooms, drinking water, and a gift shop at the visitors center at Logan Pass.

Simply breathtaking, I would recommend taking the free shuttle (a fantastic service!) from Apgar or Avalanche Creek to Logan Pass first before driving it yourself. If you're driving, it's the only way you'll really see it. Plus it gives you an idea what you're in for when you do drive it. It's a bit of a white-knuckle ride. We drove over the Rockies at RMNP and I thought that was a bit scary, but this was an order of magnitude higher. Anyway, I'm rambling...

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The Going-to-the-Sun Road runs for about 50 miles from West Glacier to the eastern side. Driving 50 miles is not a big deal, but you will be spending endless hours exploring the beauty around the road, and so there is no point of talking about how long it would take for someone to drive from one end to another end of the park. I would advise everyone to get a 7-day pass at the entrance to the Glacier National Park and explore each area on different days. The 7-day pass to a vehicle runs for $25 and it would be a safe bet to say that you will be returning to the park for several days if you have the time planned for it. The Avalanche Creek, Heavens Peak, Logan Pass and Rising Sun are some of the many spots to be visited. Plan to spend a few hours each place. For instance, the hike on the Avalanche Creek is about 3 hours through some amazing scenery and through dense forests and at the end of the hike is a view of glacially melted water rushing into a gorgeous lake. Of course, the Logan Pass is very popular and is the highest point on the road. Very hard to find parking during mid-day at Logan Pass. There is so much construction going on east of Logan Pass in July 2014 that there was a lot of time wasted to navigate through the one-way roads. So if you have less time to spend at the park, and if you are driving from the West End of the park, don't bother going beyond Logan Pass, at least till the construction is over. Of course, there are the red bus tours that you could take to see these places, but you are constrained by the time limit imposed by such tours. The park provides free shuttles which stop at strategic points. So after exploring the road by yourself on day 1, it would be a great idea for subsequent days to park at Apgar Village or Lake McDonald Lodge and take the free shuttles to some of these destinations so that you can avoid the hassles of finding parking space and also enjoy the scenery instead of concentrating on driving.","July 27, 2014",Scenic and enchanting views,35,"Boynton Beach, Florida",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Wow! We had heard a lot about this road before taking our vacation. So we knew it would be a spectacular road. Pictures and descriptions fall short of truly conveying the beauty found at every curve on this spectacular road. Be sure to pack a lunch so you can poke along and enjoy all of the turnouts and hiking opportunities. Also be sure to have your camera fully charged and at the ready. The picture opportunities are endless. If you are at all squeamish about heights, be sure to sit on the drivers side of the vehicle because on the west side of the road, you spend a great deal of time driving along the face of a steep wall, so right over the guard rail is a drop off into oblivion. Be sure to plan on taking time to explore Logan Pass visitor center. That seemed to be where the wildlife was most plentiful. But the parking lot is often times full. So either go early or plan to spend time orbiting the lot looking for parking.Our first full day at the park, the visibility was poor due to heavy smoke blowing in from wildfires in Washington. So we could only see right across the valley. Even with that limitation, the views were spectacular. The limited visibility forced you to take more notice of all of the details of what you could see. We found the west side of the road to be more interesting and spectacular, but the east side is also very beautiful and well worth the drive. There was road construction happening on the east side of the pass, so that probably negatively impacted our perception of that area of the park. The second day we did the road, the smoke had cleared, but clouds had moved in. So again our visibility was limited, but it was still very majestic and pretty in a new way.

There are many pull offs so you can take beautiful pictures. We have been to Yellowstone National park, and Alaska, and Glacier National Park rates right there with them. The hotels around the area are very crowded this time of year, so we had made advance reservations at the West Gate of the Park, we drove that in one day,, then through the East Gate of the park and we had a motel close to the east Gate. I would diffidently recommend making reservations.The drive through the park did not seem crowded, and we did not feel hurried.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"As an employee based at Lake McDonald Lodge many years ago, we lived for our days off to enjoy the park around us. Going-to-the-Sun Road, and the trails around it, are some of the most spectacular natural wonders you will have the privilege to experience.You have to start by visiting 100 year old Lk McDonald Lodge, a cozy, rustic hunting lodge that was converted into a hotel and restaurant. Relax in a rocking chair on the covered porch as you admire the sweeping views of the crisp, clear lake and surrounding mountains. Visit the multi-story lobby, decorating with hunting trophies, buckskin lanterns, and a fireplace that could swallow a moose!Avalanche Lake is a must-do hike in the valley! See polished red rock gulches of rushing water, woodlands, wildflowers, and a spectacular bowl of mountain walls adorned with multiple waterfalls that feed the crystal clear lake below.Begin your ascent to Logan Pass in the woodland forest. (A memorable way to go is by a tour aboard the parks vintage, canvas-roll-top convertible red buses!) The experience grows as your elevation gain does. Take in spectacular scenery of waterfalls, wildlife, wildflowers, mountains, valleys and snowfields. You may see moose, bears, marmots, mountain goats, and big horn sheep. Along the way is the Weeping Wall, 100 feet of waterfall that spills over a wall right into the road.At the top is Logan Pass, with sweeping views, fields carpeted by wildflowers, and towering craggy mountains. Take in the visitor center and interpretative boardwalk trail. If you have the opportunity, hike Highline trail along the Continental Divide to Granite Park Chalet. You'll start out along a narrow path with a mountain wall on one side, and breath-taking drop on the other.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I have a tremendous fear of heights and going on this road was a serious problem but my husband is excellent at making me feel at ease while driving this road. Nice and slow. Besides if you go to fast you might miss something awesome. Lane is very narrow and drop offs are major but once you get over that and look at the scenery around your breath will be taken away. Twists, turns switchbacks and inclines just describes the road. The road had temporary road barriers that are removable to allow snow to slide easily over the road without to much destruction. At many points you are right up against the mountain wall. Then there's the waterfalls. Every turn you see waterfalls. Some far away some right along the road. Weeping Wall is so much fun to drive through. Make sure you leave the windows down so you can get wet. So much fun. There are turnouts to get pictures but it's busy road so if you find one open take it. Get out and stretch your legs, take a deep breath, take a few pictures, and sit a spell. Eat a sandwich if you have one. It takes 2 hours from West Glacier to St. Mary but longer if you stop. And you need to stop. Logan Pass is at the top. If you are lucky like us, you will see long horn sheep and bears, marmots and very playful squirrels. Snow still covers much of the mountain but green is peaking through. We stopped at the visitors center on our 2nd day because the 1st day the parking lot was full. If you are lucky to get a parking spot, take your time. Hike up to Hidden Lake. The day we went it was closed due to bear activity was high but we did hike up to the overlook. It was part snow and part boardwalk. Just beautiful. At the top of the overlook there were baby goats. Lots of people were there it's very busy. We saw marmotts right on the trail too. It was pretty nice and then ofcourse you will see a ton of Red Buses. We made a game of it like slug bug but Red Bus.","July 20, 2014",Ultimate Thrill Road,50,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The Going-To-The-Sun Road had a late opening this year (2014) -- not until July 3. I had heard so many wonderful things about the Going-To-The-Sun Road I knew that the best way to see it would be with a Xanterra tour in a red jammer bus. It was an excellent way to see this spectacular road. I was able to look this way and that I didn't have to watch the road. The commentary was superb and I met interesting travelers on the bus. The driver/guide Darrell told us stories, told us which mountains, glaciers, and waterfalls we were looking at, told us about the types of flowers we saw along the road, and made the trip thoroughly enjoyable. After a 9am start, we arived at Lake MacDonald from the Many Glacier Hotel at lunchtime. While the others on the bus headed to the restaurant, I had brought my own food (I had brought with me prepared Bumble Bee tuna salad kits, GoGo Squeeze applesauce, Justin's Peanut Butter squeeze packets, and Kind fruit & nut bars) and headed to a bench on the water to eat. This gave me more time to enjoy Lake MacDonald before heading back. We did not see many animals on my tour but we did see a mountain goat. For July 7, 2014, 9 miles of the east end of the road was under construction so there were some delays on the gravel road. This is the last segment of the road being worked on and the crews expected to be done in time for the 2015 season. i also took Xanterra's Evening Glacier Tour on a red jammer. This tour was the same as the Crown Tour except it only covered from Many Glacier Hotel to Logan Pass. I had hoped that there would be more animals to see but I only saw a ram. I had also hoped for softer light because it was closer to sunset but by the time the tour ended at 7:30pm the sun will still high in the sky and two hour away. The commentary from Sarah differed from that of Darrell so I learned knew things. Plus I met other travelers. However, if I were to do it again, I would only take the Crown tour.","July 19, 2014",Xanterra Red Jammer Crown of the Continent Tour is the way to go,56,"San Diego, CA",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Although as usual there's construction with delays and gravel on the roads, we were awed by GTTSR -- don't let any of that stop you! For me, the highlight was the weeping wall. Higher temps last week caused some major melt and as we drove by, the angle of the sun created one rainbow after another. Lilies are popping up through the snow at the Visitor Center at Logan Pass. There were quite a few mountain goats hanging out on a rock wall across the road enjoying the sun. Beautiful scenery all around.","July 19, 2014",!Spectacular,20,"Hilo, Hawaii",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,Narrow for large SUV cars if you are in rental car you are unfamiliar with. Excellent trails and views along the western path.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We were fortunate to arrive at Glacier the day after the road opened for the summer. I recommend that you wait until evening to drive the road.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"You need to check the sun road opening time on the park's website. While a small section of the road on both ends are open all year round, the entire stretch only fully open in summer after snow clearing. Every spring the road crew starts snow clearing from 2 ends of the road and generally the road opens in mid June but that is weather dependent. The sun road opened rather late this year due to a storm and the road crew had to re-plot the sections previously cleared as well as clearing road debris and making repair works so the road only fully opened on July 3. We were lucky to have scheduled to go to the park on the weekend of Independence Day which was right after the road was fully open. Many parts of the park were still covered with snow. It's a nice drive of course with great views. You can also choose to take the red shuttle bus instead of driving, I don't think the drive is scary but you can free your hands to take more pictures. Plan for about 3 hours from one end to another due to low speed limit and also you will probably want to stop for some pictures. If you want to do the more popular hikes on the road eg Avalanche trail, hidden lake at Logan Pass, might need to try to reach there earlier in the morning to get a parking spot. Check the official park website for trail conditions. When we did the Hidden Lake trail it was still 100% snow covered. Many people still went ahead anyway but might be better if you have the right shoes and equipment. We saw some big horn sheep and mountain goats.But don't just drive through the sun road and call it quits. The park has so much more to offer. There are great views at each of the lakes and cruises and/or kayak rentals are available and the park has many nice short day hikes as well longer trails. You will most likely see some wild life too. Visit the beautiful Many Glacier area including the historic hotel, if you have time also check out the less crowded areas eg Two Medicine, Northern Fork or even crossing over to Waterton Lake National park in Canada.","July 17, 2014",Beautiful scenery nice drive but don't just stop there,39,"Singapore, Singapore",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We recently drove the Going-to-the-Sun Road while visiting Glacier National Park. We were so fortunate that it reopened while we were on vacation! It was an absolutely beautiful drive, with a lot of things to see and places to pull over. We timed the drive so that we entered the park right at 8 am. We made all of our stops to see things on the way to Logan Pass, in the morning, on the way there. This worked out for the best, because the Road was incredibly busy in the afternoon, as were the pullouts and we would not have been able to stop and see the sights, had we waited until the afternoon. While the road is narrow and very high up, it was not as scary as I had anticipated that it would be.

Definitely the best ""inland"" drive I have ever taken and it compares with the Pacific Coast Highway and Road to Hana (in Maui) as the greatest scenery. It took about two hours to go through it, partly due to construction and my pulling over. Don't drive it distracted, there are plenty of deep falls and water-holes not to mention giant rocks jutting out from the sides. There will be places you don't want to go faster than 10 MPH. Worth the $25 admission fee to to Glacier National Park on its own. I didn't hike yet (will today), but you can get off anywhere and jump on one of the hiking trails.

There are a lot of pull outs along the road to take in the vistas. There can be a lot of traffic on the road and parking was difficult to find at Logan Pass.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We have visited Glacier numerous times and the scenery is spectacular on the drive. Here are some important things to know about the Going to the Sun road.First, the road is only open for a few months out of the year. This year, they had a heavy snow fall and they didn't get it open until around July 1. So, if you are planning a June trip - keep this in mind.Second, the views are totally different going each way. To truly soak in the majesty of GNP from the road, try to go over and back.Third, they limit the size vehicles that can go over the pass. No trailers or big campers/RV's. The road is too curvy and narrow.Fourth, if you can only go over one way and you have issues with driving and drop offs, I recommend going east to west. For most (not all) of the drive you are on the mountain side.Fifth, to avoid heavy traffic I recommend going over early or late in the day. During peak hours, it could be a lengthy trip. Sixth, Logan Pass parking lot is small and fills up quickly. See above on timing.Seventh, expect construction. They are on year 10 of a 15 year road restoration project. They have finished the west side and are now working on the east side.Glacier is one of my favorite places on Earth. Definitely do the road, but stay a few days and explore other parts of the park.","July 10, 2014",A must!,201,"Athens, Georgia",5

Mountain goats at top car pull over before Logan Pass, we named him Stanley ...he certainly knew how to pose for the camera! Garden Wall is great and traffic while moves fast never had an issue pulling in or out of pull over areas. Stop and park at Avalanche Creek/Lake hike point, hike is only 2 miles and worth the ups and downs ( we are not hikers) to get to the lake! Along the way we stopped at the creek running fast for time of year and were amazed how beautiful the cedars and creek views are!

Be aware that snow at the upper reaches of the road often does not get cleared until early July - sometimes in late June. We were lucky to be there the first day it opened. We went over it twice on two different days so we could see it from both directions. Snow was still very deep in Logan Pass where they had created a 'cut' to allow cars to pass. Early summer snow melt makes the waterfalls incredible, but can make the roads wet in places. If you are nervous about heights or driving in the mountains, then it is recommended that you take one of the bus tours. The historic buses are quaint and alleviate anyone from having to drive and miss the glorious views. As a driver you will need to keep full attention on the road. Road is two lane and in summer it can be busy. However it is worth waiting till it is open all the way through. Weather can be iffy so try to go when it is not raining or foggy which can be hard to predict. It is a good idea to stay at least a week in the area to assure the weather cooperates.

The road takes you through varying terrains that the park has to offer, from tundra to cedar forests and glacier lakes. The scenery was truly spectacular and thankfully there were plenty of stopping points on route for photos. We drove over in the morning when it was foggy and back later in the day in glorious sunshine, giving us two different perspectives. It's well worth going in both directions as the views differ enormously. ","June 10, 2014",Mesmerizing beauty,7,"Bath, United Kingdom",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The drive is real fantastic and enjoyable. We had lot of fun driving on this road and enjoying the beautiful nature. We could not drive the whole distance since tho road was closed. We were told that the roads would be opened by June 20. We had landed up a bit early, but enjoyed the beautiful park and road as there was no crowd. The road is about 52 miles long, winding around mountain sides and wait until you see the views!The proposed route was first surveyed in 1918 and completed in 1932. Building this transmountain road, which was literally carved out of the precipitous mountainside for 12 of it's 50-mile length, was a challenging and dangerous task.The winding road gains more than 1400 feet in 32 miles and crosses the Continental Divide.","June 8, 2014",Enjoy the drive and the beautiful nature,766,"Bengaluru, India",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We have never driven on a road in the United States as awe-inspiring and heart-stopping as this one and I am sure most Americans would agree too! You certainly require good motoring skills, adeptness and bravado. It is not a drive for the timid or those prone to fear of heights!The beauty of this road is looking out and down, neither of which is really advisable to do unless you've come to a complete stop off the side of the road! There are some areas along the road to pull over, but it is sometimes clogged up with other vehicles stopping in succession.If it's your first time and you want to get an overview of the Park before renting a car or driving it yourself, then I highly recommend that you get on a Red Jammer bus tour! The drivers will equip you with tips, tricks and invaluable info on the park for your own onward independent journey!The road has spectacular natural features along its route like the Weeping Wall and stunning waterfalls that cascade down to road level and some that actually flow under it! There are man-made construction features that also amaze like the Triple Arches which span a rift on the side of Pollock Mountain under the road! You can only imagine the bravery of the men who built this road at these dizzying heights with sheer drops!This road is 50 miles long and meanders its way up to 6,646 feet!

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"In case you were wondering, I thought it was a wonderful drive. The views were stunning and although we happened to pick a cloudy day with drizzle it was till quite amazing. Sometimes the views were obscured, but at other times the sun would burst through and the rays would light up the peaks and valleys below while cloud caressed the mountains. These are the types of drive I live for and it's right up there with the likes of the Beartooth Highway in Yellowstone, The Trail Ridge road in Rocky mountain NP and the fabulous Tioga Pass in Yosemite. I found the drive to be quite easy, sure it's twisty and steep in places but hey, it's a mountain pass. If you are at all concerned about your nerves you can always take a red bus tour and let someone else worry about the driving.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Literally? It's name sake says it all. It's like going to the Sun. First of all, let me say that I'm glad I was not driving, since I am afraid of heights. A few things to remember when you take this road: (1) It is narrow (2) It is a National Park (3) Lots of other vehicles on the road (4) It is meant to be enjoyed. So please, be courteous to other drivers. This is not a road for those who are in a hurry, and if you are, better take a different route.Make sure you have extra batteries for taking pictures. There are a lot of trails to go around, therefore, don't forget to wear good hiking shoes. Might not be a bad idea to take along fanny packs for your bottled water too. Wear good rain gear as well as appropriate-for weather gear. My husband and I were here in September of 2012, therefore, it was oh-so-cold. I was wearing shorts at the time from a long trip from Canada, so this stop was super cold to be wearing shorts. Be prepared for some road hiccups. At the time we travelled, there was a road construction, we were stopped at the summit for about 15 minutes. I took that time to get out and take amazing photos. Don't forget to bring your telescope for wildlife viewing, there are mountain goats up there.This visit may take so much of your time and before you know it, it might be late in the day.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This road through the mountain passes is definitely not for the feint of heart. While not as extreme as ""The Death Road"" in Bolivia or some of the passes in Nepal, this well maintained highway provides some breathtaking views of the Rockies. Winding it's way from the bottom where you drive along Lake McDonald and the river that feeds, high up the mountain with views as far as the eye can see. There are a number of turn outs where you can take a break along the road and take some pictures, or just let other vehicles pass. If your vehicle is not good on gas, and struggles with hills, you may want to reconsider your choice of wheels for this trip. Parts of the road can get rough, remember it is covered in ice and snow through winter months, and the freeze/thaw cycle can do some serious damage, though being a national park, they do a good job in maintaining it as bes they can.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"GOING-TO-THE-SUN ROAD travels the distance of Logan Pass, and it goes from the Avalanche Lake area to the area of St. Mary's Lake. This is a 2-lane road which provides plenty of elbow room for most passenger cars, but the road is likely to be risky, and is sometimes closed off, because of ice and snow. The Road is likely to be fun for children because of the occasional tunnels (children love tunnels), but is likely to be scary for adults behind the wheel, because of the steep cliffs occurring to the south edge of the road. At the northern edge of the road, is a steep mountainside, and so it is impossible for any automobile to veer off the northern edge of the road and tumble down any cliff. The Road provides world-class views, especially of a waterfall called, ""Bird Woman Falls."" The very best views can be had, by parking at the visitor's center, which is located on Going-to-the-Sun Road, and taking a short ten minute hike to the crest of the trail that leads to Hidden Lake. Especially enjoyable, for children and adults, are the red-colored buses that tote visitor's across Logan Pass on Going-to-the-Sun Road. Small models of these red-colored buses can be purchased at the gifts shops in Glacier National Park. I did not take the bus ride, but I think that people not up to the task of driving along this scary mountain road might be especially tempted to take the bus ride. At any rate, my goal in visiting Glacier National Park was not really to rub shoulders with other tourists, but to take hikes. Altogether, I took five hikes, each lasting about one hour, round trip. These were the Hidden Lake trail, Lunch Creek trail, St. Mary's Falls trail, Avalanche Lake trail, and Sunrift Gorge trail, Without access provided by Going-to-the-Sun Road, these hikes would not have been possible for me.","January 25, 2014","Fun for children because of the tunnels, but scary for adults",349,"Berkeley, California",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I drove this road from September 15 to September 20, 2013. I first came in from the west side and I was not impressed for a long time. I have been to several national parks including Yellowstone, the Tetons, Crater and Yosemite, etc. I kept thinking “what a disappointment”. The nickname is Crown Jewel of the Continent and I expected it to blow all other parks out of the water but I was not feeling that way at all – at least no on this day. There is a creek after leaving Lake McDonald heading to Logan’s called Sprague Creek on the left. That was a nice stop. I wanted to stop at Heaven’s Peak to hike up but the parking is limited and some of them are tiny spots. Many of the famous waterfalls heading toward Logan’s Pass were dried up like Haystack or running very low like Birdwoman Falls. As I approached Logan’s pass it was getting better but I was still not as impressed as with other parks. The hiking around Logan’s Pass (Hidden Lake and Highline are beautiful) while the parking there is atrocious on weekends. Bring binoculars because I did and saw three bighorn sheep WAY UP on the side of the mountain and Billy Goats on the Highline hike. I could see the goats ok without them but not the sheep. Going past Logan’s Pass the scenery was getting better. Two big waterfalls were coming over the mountain into the shoulder of the road just past the tunnel nearby. Pulling over was a bit of a challenge but do it if you can. The falls gave me nice shots looking up at them and then looking back at Logan’s. Down the road was Sunrift Gorge and St Mary’s and Virginia Falls trailheads. Sunrift gorge was 200 feet straight up but definitely worth the effort even with low water in fall. Further ahead I hit construction around St Mary’s lake. The lake was nice. Almost near the end of the road was the pullout to Wild Goose Island. Now that is a grand view. You can’t miss that one.As I was leaving I kept thinking awe, bummer. I know some people have to be thinking “she is nuts”. Well, I guess I expect more each time or maybe I was bummed because my mom did not get to with me this trip. Anyway, I was headed up to Many Glacier and even though this was not part of the Going to the Sun road, I was wowed! The next day I left Many Glacier to come back and enter the park again but this time via the east entrance.OH MAN. The drive just getting to the entrance provided a much different view of the crown jewel. Then I remembered something my backpacking instructor told us in college while we were hiking one day. TURN AROUND. We were all like, why, we just came that way. Well, the view needless to say is completely different. Congratulations to you if you did not have to be told that. So, I remembered my instructor that day in the car and how I had forgotten one cardinal rule of travel…TURN AROUND and LOOK where you came from.The view the entire way was magnificent and I said to myself “Now I know why they call it the Crown Jewel of the Continent”. It really is that different.Another day I left via the east entrance and went down to Two Medicine. The scenery was fabulous. Even though you could see where previous fires had been, the burned trees in front of the lake and mountains were just….. well, I am running out of adjectives. That night it snowed and I came in the next day via the east entrance again. I kept getting WOWED. My best pictures are on this day. The snow on the peaks made it surreal and I wanted to extend my vacation hoping it would snow more. I have already planned that late fall (later than September) when I will take off and travel only the parks in the west and I will travel those parks in the winter which allow me.If I had it to do all over again, I would fly into Idaho Falls and travel up to stay at Glacier Lodge for 3 nights. If you are not into hiking, this would be ideal because you could take a day and go to Two Medicine down the road then the next day go up to many Glacier and finally the last day go and enter via the east entrance and come out the west entrance then travel the road that goes around the park at the bottom of the park. I traveled this road as well and it is pleasant to very nice. Three days would be relaxing with boat rides and such but you could it in two days. Two Medicine and Many Glacier one day and the Going to the Sun road another day. If you only have one day, you are pressing it especially in high season with crowds.","January 22, 2014",Coming in from the east side,471,"Gatlinburg, Tennessee",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,". . . you need to drive this road. My wife and I took our vacation to visit Glacier NP in late August 2013 with an itinerary that ended up taking us on approx. 30 miles of hiking trails in the park -- Siyeh Pass is not to be missed, by the way. However, even if you are not a ""get-away-from-the crowds"" type, you will want to drive this magnificent road. Being a flatlander from Philly, it took me a while to overcome a tinge of fear I had driving this relatively narrow, but well-paved road, but it was worth every sweat bead. While driving, play Vivaldi's Four Seasons CD and roll down the windows. If there's a heaven, it should be so lucky to have a road like this. Every bend, twist and turn opens a new, glorious perspective. We started from the west entrance, which allows the ""spectacularness"" of the drive to build as you reach Logan Pass. Very limited parking at Logan Pass -- go early if you plan to attempt hikes from the Logan Pass and you are driving and need to park. We drove the road three of four times from both directions during our stay. We never tired of the fabulous views. When we were hiking, which was 8 days, we parked the car at lesser used parking areas and used the park's shuttle system to get to different trailheads. The shuttle is fantastic and it's free! Twice there was road construction on the St. Mary side of the road that stopped traffic, but we left early enough in the morning to incorporate the 25-minute wait into our schedule.","January 17, 2014",Even if you do nothing else . . .,13,suburban Philly,5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Our drive began at the Western entrance of the GNP at the Apgar Visitors Centre where we bought bear pepper spray for the hikes ahead. (You can't be too careful out there in the wilds of Montana.) We stopped at the picturesque Lake McDonald with reflections of the high mountain peaks in the water. There were some roadworks but that gave us time to look around at the gorgeous scenery. It was worthwhile stopping at Avalanche Creek and taking the short walk on the Trail of the Cedars. You will need warm clothing and sturdy footwear for this walk. As we neared the top of the Going-To-The-Sun Highway the drizzly rain lifted to reveal spectacular panoramas of the deep valley below. We loved the soaring peaks and glacier near Logan Pass. Be sure to take the trail leading to Hidden Lake if you have time. Our camera clicking skills went into overdrive by the time we reached the Jackson Glacier Lookout and the St Mary Lake. The scenery reminded me of Switzerland with the pine trees, a deep blue lake and the towering mountain peaks. This is one drive we will never forget. Take your time and enjoy every minute this unbelievable drive.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I've been through the Sun Road a few times and it never fails to take my breath away. Although in the ten years between my visits I did notice that the glacier has unfortunately shrunk quite a bit (it's all Al Gore's fault, of course). Our second time there, we came across a lot of wildlife, with some kind of lynx (?) moving far up on the mountainside, and a friendly goat who came to visit the parking lot. I think there was an eagle or a hawk, too. Of course, the highlight of the visit was the fact that Brooke's pants finally gave up the ghost and basically burst off her like she was the Incredible Hulk, although one with sexy panties. So the Incredible Hulk as a crossdresser. (Yes, I know there is a She-Hulk). Anyway, even with her very clothes falling off her luscious body, Brooke was so captivated by the beauty of Glacier that we soldiered on and made a full day of hiking, driving, and admiring the view.","December 7, 2013","Postcard views, animals, disintegrating pants",128,"Fisherville, Kentucky",5

Also take your time to make sure you don't miss a moment of the journey. I would suggest stopping at Logan's Pass to enjoy the ranger station and the hiking trails that originate from there.

When you reach Logan Pass (only 8000 ft elev) there is a visiter center but parking is so limited that we didn't even stop. The greatest vistas are on the west side of Logan Pass. The road winds and hugs the northern face of the canyon. With each turn there is a new view of mountains and peaks.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We did this road trip mid Sept 2013, and weather & visibility was good - a sunny day with blue skies. There were plenty of roadside places where we could stop and take pictures. Traffic was not bad, and lots of turn-outs where you could pull over and let people behind you go ahead and pass.Most drivers, like us, were not in any hurry, and this allowed time to take in all the surrounding beauty.We stopped at Logan's Pass for lunch, and although the parking lot was nearly full, there was always a few open spots with people coming and going constantly.We started our trip in Kalispell, where we picked up our rental car at the airport. I was actually expecting to receive a larger SUV, but they only had a smaller 4 cylinder SUV which as predicted struggled to climb up some of the steeper inclines. We drove from west to east, and the GTTS drive went by a lot quicker than expected. I would recommend doing the trip again in reverse direction to get the different perspective and changes in traffic, weather on a different day. There is an entrance fee to get into GNP but I was told that it is good for a few days. In any case, I chose to purchase an Inter-agency annual pass for $80 which I could use again and again for other planned trips to Yellowstone, RMNP, etc. Even if I did not get the full use out of that, I like to think it was a small donation towards the up-keep of this beautiful national park.","October 19, 2013",Outstanding and memorable,35,"Brisbane, Australia",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,This drive is an absolute MUST if you're in Glacier! It has to be amongst the top most scenic roads in the US. There aren't words sufficient to describe the beauty that exists around every bend that will literally take your breath away. Take a camera with loads of memory; I know I shot a couple hundred pictures in the park in just one day. I visited the first time in the summer of '95 and again in 2010. I was saddened to see how dramatically the glacier had shrunk. Put this on your bucket list and see it soon before the glacier is completely gone!

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I drove the GTTS Road 4 times while at Glacier for 2 weeks. The first time, I took the whole day, and stopped every... it felt like every few feet, but probably every 1/2 mile or so. Since I live in the mountains, I was not bothered by the curves and cliffs. I was more worried about rocks coming down the hillside onto the top of my car as I saw lots of fallen rock in the roadway. And if someone wanted to go faster than me, then I just pulled over and stopped for photos. Definitely an early start is a must, I left at daybreak from Apgar, Lake McDonald, and got to Saint Mary on the other side about 3pm. The views were amazing. I had a guide book with the Must See spots along the way and a map page open on the seat next to me, that was a BIG help. Take your time, stop often, just sit and stare. Take a picnic lunch, snacks and beverages, there is very little in the way of shops and restaurants along the way. Get out of the car and do short walks, or longer hikes if you can. The other 3 times I drove the road it was to ""get someplace"", like a trailhead or my lodging, and I was able to do the entire road in 1 to 2 hours, no stopping except for construction zones.","September 23, 2013","Amazing Scenic Road - Take All Day to Enjoy, Stop Everywhere!",314,"Groveland, California",5

Check with the park's entry stations for trip delays. (Ours were only 15 minutes.) Restrooms and gift shop are available at Logan Pass.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We traveled to Glacier after seeing Mt. Rainier and we were so glad that we decided to come up to take in this absolutely beautiful national park. The drive we took, west to east, is one of the most beautiful drives we have ever been on. You NEED to take your time stop frequently and enjoy the trip. We would have liked to spend several days in the vicinity and will probably come back because this park's complexion will change, possibly radically, in the next twenty years or so, with the melting of the glaciers. Glacier NP without glaciers, political arguments aside, means Glacier NP without year round water, and this is a park dependent on water. As a side note, when we come back we will drive it both ways, but the road is a little harrowing for some and you can take a tour bus. And, as noted, the summit, with some beautiful short walks, is on the Continental Divide, and it can be quite cool at that altitude.

With scenery like this, it's a pleasure to sit still for a while, and we never waited more than about 8 or 10 minutes. The road is very narrow in places. Definitely not for the faint of heart, nor for those driving a wide vehicle or trailer, which is not permitted.

Fortunately, the speed limit is 25 MPH, and one really would be foolish to go faster.

It's recommended to go EARLY to avoid the crowds. We didn't do that, but we made it okay anyway. We are very experienced mountain drivers so we opted to drive our own car instead of taking the free shuttle. For those who aren't experienced in narrow, windy and steep roads overhanging sheer drop offs, I would recommend riding in the shuttle with an experienced driver.

If you cannot handle tight spaces and high ledges then you may want to let one of the shuttles do the driving. It is best in late summer when they have had time to clear off the snow but there is still enough run off that all the waterfalls are gushing, and weeping walls are pouring down. Do not get in a hurry because even when traffic is not at a crawl you must take your time to navigate the sharp turns, tunnels, and rock ledges.

If heights, really narrow windy roads make you extremely nervous you may be tempted not to venture onto the western side of this road.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I read a lot about this road as one of the most spectacular views in the world, and that sets the bar really high, so I was a bit skeptical ...Well, this is totally true. There are higher mountains, there are bigger or more colorful, but for a mountain road it's really as good as it gets ... This place has a sense of balance, composition, scale and drama on so many levels - amazing!When you drive to the park, the area is relatively flat and then you see a group of mountains towering above the planes. There is a grand entrance, not a human made gate, but a group of rocks leading you to the canyon and then one by one some of the most majestic views of the mountains, cliffs, rocks, lakes, glaciers, waterfalls start to unfold. The scale is just right. You feel overwhelmed but still connected.It's a perfect balance of geological and living wonders to completely capture your attention. Also, the road has logical composition of a grand entry point, literally top point at the summit and then it comes to an end at the West village where you can spend some time thinking about what you've seen.This is probably the best half a day mountain road trip you can possibly imagine.Highly highly recommended.On a practical side ... Since the road goes mostly east to west, if you start early in the day and keep Sun behind you, you might see the mountains in a better light. On a flip side, since the roads can be jammed, going late might make it less crowded. But the mountains are majestic at any time of the day, so dont worry too much - you will remember them forever and the little annoying details will fade away from your memory quickly.The road is 50 miles long, so driving through with minimum of stops takes about 2 hours. There is ongoing road construction and limited parking along the way, so if you have a whole day - take a shuttle. If you want to make it in a half a day or less - your own car would do, but this is a place where being a driver feels like a distraction.","September 3, 2013","Yes, it's one of the best views in the world indeed",881,"Pleasanton, California",5

From the cool spring-like weather to the snow and sleet at Logan Pass to the warm sunny weather at the eastern entrance, this drive had it all!

The great views came, for me, when we took a red bus tour from the East back to the Logan Pass/Continental Divide. Letting our driver Chance (ironic name for a great driver) safely make the trip giving us a commentary at the same time.So, National Geographic numbers this as one of the top drives anywhere.

We decided to drive our rental car instead of taking the red bus and explore on our own. The drive is heavenly, such stunning views. I had been to Glacier once before but the Going to the Sun Road was closed due to snow so we were thrilled to have this opportunity to experience it. This is one of the best drives anywhere, something wonderful to view all along the way. We took our time and used the pullouts so we could really grasp the views.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Today is THE DAY – we are going to the Glacier National Park, something we’ve been wanting to do for a couple of years now. We enter from the West Glacier entrance (most books tell you it’s the more interesting one and it turns out they are all right). After paying the hefty fee, we are on our way to the Going to the Sun Road. First, we stop for a short detour to Apgar village, providing us with splendid views of Lake McDonald, then on through the tick forests with short stops for glimpses and photos of the Lake. The Lake McDonald Lodge is a great stop to relax, have a coffee and decide if you want to take the boat trip in the lake (1 hr, $16.25/person) or the Red bus. These are really cute, they have been there since the beginning, about 100 yrs. Don’t worry, they were all refurbished and look and feel better than ever. The road is paved all the way but the Alpine section is closed to vehicles over 21 ft and it’s narrow with overhanging rocks. Several places along the way where you can park and go for a hike, two tunnels, West and East. I had rented a 4-wheel car to deal with difficult roads, but this is not one of them, it’s easy and not much crowded either, even though it’s the last week before Labor Day. For many the high-point of this drive is reaching St. Mary’s Lake – the lake, the evergreens reaching for the sky, the pointed picks of the “Garden Wall” (the Continental Divide), they all combine to make you feel like in a ferry tale. This is Montana, the weather can change incredibly fast: around 4PM, from sunny and bright, the skies suddenly turn black and a storm starts with lightening and diluvial outpour. It only lasts about half an hour and the aroma of the evergreen after the storm is sublime. We skip the rest of the boat trips along the Going to the Sun Road and go home happy and tired. Tomorrow is another day.","August 29, 2013",Pines and Picks – one more delightful than the other,1207,"New York City, New York",4

The history of the park, McDonald Lodge,building of the road (brave and gutsy men!!), lakes, trails, wild life & flowers, the jammers (red bus) is all fascinating...then add the majestic mountains of the divide!! Amazing!!! Beauty abounds in every direction! Worth driving from West Glacier to East Glacier thru the park and back...because the view is different from each direction. You need more than a day in this park to enjoy the beauty and the park pass is good for 7 days! Timing is important since the snow stays late and arrives early which can limit your adventure on the Going to the Sun Road. Speed is slow which is a plus! Take a jammer if you really want to free yourself up to see the views! Road repairs are common due to winter harshness but the road crews make it painless and it allows you to stop and get a close up/stand still view of the park. Wait times are very short!

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This is a beautiful drive through Glacier national park. The mountain scenery is spectacular but take note, on the west side, of how the road was originally engineered in the 1930s to enjoy the spectacular view with only one switchback called The Loop. The water culverts (east and west sides) were made of stone from the area and are artistically done to blend in with the scenery. The east side was more conducive to taller, longer vehicles but there is a vehicle size limit. There is major road repair ongoing till 2016.

The catch to this road, at least right now, is that they close the road from 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. during the week. It took us 3 hours to drive from the west entrance over to many glacier due to construction. Get on the road early so you miss some of the traffic and don't have to deal with the people who can't seem to drive a curvy road and stay in their lane.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Weather was perfect and traffic was moderate (I would hate to go through on weekends). As usual no parking at Logan Pass Centre but we got lucky and found a roadside pull in nearby. I think a better way to do it is park half way up and use the white shuttles. We made the 3mi return hike to Hidden Lake. The trail is simple however the wooden steps are large. Encountered marmot and further up lots of mountain goat with babies that would walk right beside you as they headed to find snow and cool off. It is very touristy but worth the stop to stretch the legs. Road construction causes some delays but wasn't bad. Tried to stop and Lake MacDonald as well for lunch but no parking and lots of cars getting warnings or tickets so ventured on. We do this drive every few years and always find it beautiful. If you don't like cliffs, I would suggest going east to west as we do as you are primarily on the inside of the mountain and your passengers should be less frightened, the driver really needs today attention.","August 20, 2013",Perfect day,60,"Calgary, Canada",5

The lower portion is fairly flat but the last 16 miles is up, really up. If you plan that the last 16 miles will take up to forty minutes you will not get frustrated. We went twice, once on a sunday afternoon and once at nine thirty in the morning. The morning trip was faster as there was not as much traffic. There is a small Visitor Center at Logan Pass. Make sure you take any drinks with you as they don't sell any. If you do the hike to Hidden Lake make sure you have decent shoes and water. The hike is great but it is up hill and has lots of steps.

This construction takes out the Jackson Glacier Overlook and you'll miss it if you don't know exactly where it is. The construction workers were nice enough to direct us and even stopped what they were doing so we can see the one Glacier you can see from this road. The construction also took out two major pull-outs for St. Mary's Lake which is the other big thing to see. Quite disappointing. TAKE THE ROAD at the MANY GLACIERS entrance. The road only goes 12 miles into the park. Less congestion, though the road isn't as kept up with as the main road. Saw Moose and multiple bears just on the short drive.

My secret is that in the late afternoon to dusk, you have a good chance of seeing bighorn sheep near Lunch Creek on the road. They also seen to enjoy the mountainside to the left of the front of the Visitor Center at Logan Pass. Rocky Mountain Goats gravitate to the mountainside on your left JUST as you leave Logan Pass heading to the West side of the road.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We were there August 4, 2013. This is a once in a lifetime experience. Traffic was busy as otherwise stated but you really aren't wanting to speed on the road anyway. The views were amazing ~ waterfalls, I touched snow at one point, temperatures dropped 20 degrees on our way up in the morning. It was amazing to see how the terrain changed as we went through different areas. I've only seen the Smokey Mountains and they are beautiful but nothing compared to Glacier National Park. We saw Mountain Goats (Rams?), and I saw a black bear munching on huckleberries! That was the highlight for me because all I wanted to see in Montana was a bear. We took the road both ways and you really do get different views each way and because we started out late morning the light was so different then our return mid/late afternoon. There were a lot of pedestrians on the road which in some areas was a bit of a challenge as the road gets very narrow in some parts. Lots of people just pulling off to look at the sights but I guess that is to be expected, we are all seeing a very majestic sight. We tried to get to the visitor's center each way and it was FULL so we weren't able to park and get out, that wasn't a deal breaker for us. On our way out of the park a deer was just trotting alongside the road at her own pace. Beautiful place. Be sure to have a confident driver as the road is quite tricky in some areas.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We were there midweek, but the place was still absolutely packed. Traffic was almost literally bumper-to-bumper all the way up and down the pass. There was literally no parking at either the Logan Pass visitor's center or the Avalanche Creek area where we wanted to go hiking. We drove eastbound through the park and found no parking, so we thought we might take the free shuttle buses to get to our destinations instead. Unfortunately the bus service only leaves St. Mary's (the east end of the park) every 40 minutes, and it's even less frequent in the late afternoon and evening. That means the buses really aren't a practical alternative. So we drove back west over the pass. Again most of the pull-outs were full, and there was no parking at either Logan Pass or Avalanche Creek. We were glad we had entered the park with a senior citizen pass. If we'd had to pay the regular $25 admission fee (there is no daily admission available--unless you're a senior, they force you to buy a week-long entry), it really would have been a rip-off.There are some spectacular views in Glacier National Park, but they really need to find a way to limit the traffic on the road. I'd strongly suggest they erect parking ramps at the entrances and force visitors to take transit in the park.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Glacier National Park is a national treasure and driving the Going-to-the-Sun-Road is an important part of this parks total experience and not to be missed. The road is not hard to drive and it's very safe and you can't go that fast. We entered the park by the west gate at 8:30am and it was a good thing we were early because they were working on the road, which may go on the rest of the summer, as there were delays. In general the traffic wasn't bad and by the time you get to the Logan Pass Visitor Center there was still parking available even with photos stops and the construction delays along the road. If you come into the park later we were told parking is a problem. The Logan Pass Visitor center is a great place to stop and walk around or hike to see the beautiful scenery and watch for animals. We saw a lot of wildlife in this area including, mountain goats and bighorn sheep just to mention a few. After our several hour stop at Logan Pass we drove to Saint Mary Lake and went to the town of Saint Mary. Saint Mary is where the Going-to-the-Sun-Road ends on the east side of the park, so rather then driving back the way we came to get to Kalispell, where we were staying, and dealing with the traffic and road construction, we drove around the south end of the park on route 89 to 2. This drive is very picturesque and you see the park from a different perspective and we saw more wildlife including moose, it takes 2 to 3 hours.

The pull-offs help with taking in all the beauty.Definitely take time to pull off. Bring lots of room on your memory card. The hikes along the way are spectacular.

It is the main road through the park so it gets you from A to B, but it is also a feature in itself. A feat of mountain road engineering, the road offers stunning mountain, valley, lake, forest and river views the entire length. This is definitely worth a visit! Stop off at Logan Pass half way to see mountain goat and big horn sheep - this is where they hang out the most! There was road works whilst we were staying which was unfortunate as the road was closed from 9pm-7am, and there were a few traffic jams at peak times of the day, but maintenance work has to be done in the summer when the road is free from snow.

The weeping wall was weeping, not crying, during our visit in early July as snow melt was slowing. We drove to Logan Pass to get parking and hike then turned around and did parts of the West side again for photo-ops and to see it from another perspective.You do need nerves to drive the road and must be willing to go very slow if not for yourself then for other drivers and those who are a bit intimidated and tend to hug the center line.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"When in Glacier…The Going to the Sun Road is a staple, a hallmark, a must do, marvel of engineering achievement and one of the great drives in the country if not the world.Pros- (See above) An awesome way to spend a day driving. Yes…a day. Harken back to the days of the road trip…pack some snacks…relax and take your time because around every bend there are really cool pull offs (many not in your guide book so look sharp!) If you have a small car pull off everywhere you can (we pulled over just after the tunnel in West Glacier…had a nice shower from the waterfall, got to walk into the tunnel, etc…really cool stuff!)Cons-We did not have traffic though I suspect we were lucky. We had planned for the trip to take the day so we got an early start. The biggest con I can report is those folks who seemed to be in some kind of hurry. Of course they will be there…they are heading to a hike, a hotel or whatever…but it does alter the magic of the drive a bit when you are getting your drive on and someone can’t take that you are going the speed limit.Bottom line- If you were in Paris you would want to see the Eiffel Tower. If you are in Glacier you do the Going to the Sun Road…If it is open… you gotta do it. My recommendation is if you are going to do it, make a point to try and take it all in… the journey IS the destination.","August 4, 2013",The journey IS the destination- Pros and Cons,156,"Olympia, Washington",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I'll be perfectly and bluntly honest, this road is amazing but if you only spend your trip to Glacier on the road then you are part of the problem. Get out of your car and hike the trails, you miss out on the best parts of the park if you never leave the road. Don't be lazy. If your only intention is to drive the road then you are needlessly polluting a beautiful area. Take a red bus tour if you want to do that, they at least run on propane. The road is packed because of car tourists and the parking lots are full of people who never intend to step foot on the trails. What a disservice! If you're disabled then be my guest and enjoy the road, but if you're not then you have NO excuse to not get out and hike.

There are plenty of places to pull off, and lots of small parking lots.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Going-to-the-Sun Road is a MUST when visiting Glacier National Park. If you don't mind heights, you can drive it yourself. There are numerous pull-outs and trail heads with minimal parking areas so you can drive and still see the sights. Once the snow clears and the road is fully open, allow yourself a couple of hours or more to drive one-way. That way, you can stop and see the majestic mountains, lakes, and glaciers. Keep your eyes open for wildlife that roam the area (and occasionally, the road). The road is two lanes, but at higher altitudes, it's a long way down! If you don't like the idea of driving in the mountains, find another way to see the road. If you don't want to drive, you can take the free shuttle, or the red bus ""jammer"" from the 1920's (they offer an informative tour). During peak seasons, GTS road can be very congested, making it harder to stop at pull outs and scenic areas. Drive it early, or take a shuttle. We visited Glacier in late June, and the road opened on our last day there (about June 28). Even then, the snow was pilled twice as high as our SUV near Logan Pass! While I felt safe driving/riding on GTS Road, it's not a quick route. There are many narrow sections and switchback turns, as well as steep edges in many areas.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"If you want to be mesmerized at every turn by the magnificence of natural beauty then this road through Glacier National Park will knock your socks off. Unbelievable waterfalls, unexpected meadows, endless vistas and rock formations are around every corner. The road is narrow with a rock face on one side and magnificent and deadly drops to rocky rivers on the other. The snow is always present except in late summer. If you are terrified of winding roads with sheer drops if you crash through the rather flimsy guard rails then this beautiful meander through timeless beauty is not for you. Large vehicles like campers or fifth wheels are not a good idea. The road can become congested in the summer and can close at any time due to weather changes and unpredictable rock slides. Without a doubt, this drive is breathtaking and extremely exhilarating. Not for the faint of heart and there are no stopping places to use the restroom so come prepared with some other solution. The drive is slow, deliberate and fantastic for the views and the bare beauty. The air is so crisp and clean; the waterfalls appear to be mountains crying and the climbing elevation affords views of Earth like no other place on the planet. Bring water and prepare for cooler weather than you may expect. If you go when the road first opens in the spring be ready with a heavy jacket but in the summer a light jacket will do. Don't forget your camera so you can remember what Earth looked like when no humans were there to observe it. This ride is a gift from Mother Nature and the wildflowers decorate her face.

THe going to the Sun Road took 12 years to build and opened in 1933 as a dirt road. The Red Jammer busses got there nickname because the transmissions use to jam when the gears shifted going up and down the mountain roads.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,This is a great drive to take EARLY in the morning. Later in the day it is miserable. Some people should not drive in the mountains because they are terrified of curves and hills. But if you get up early and get going this drive has scenic views every two feet and I will assure you that you have never seen anything like it. The glaciers are slowly disappearing so plan to get there soon within the next 8-10 years. Turnouts are frequent. Make sure you have enough batteries for your cameras because you will want to capture everything. The last thing is the Going to the Sun Road is not open year round you will have to time your visit so that the Road is actually open.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The views are to die for and many times looking down, I thought how easy it would be to fly off and die!!!! We drove the road three times during our trip...twice just to Logan Pass (we stayed on both sides of park, so those days we drove to hike and see views from each direction to Logan Pass) and once from one side to the other to change hotels. The views are different when you approach from different directions, so if you have time do it both ways. There were mountain goats grazing just down from Logan Pass on east side two of three days and the other day there were goats and big horn sheep on the Hidden Lake hike. The wildflowers were in bloom and were beautiful. All the waterfalls actually reminded me of Kauai!

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We were staying in Whitefish, but we drove up to the St. Mary's entrance to Glacier NP, and drove the Going to the Sun Road from there, and we started our journey at 8am. This is the opposite way most travelers would go, but I have a teenager that isn't crazy about heights, and I heard if you enter the park this way you drive next to the mountain, instead of on the cliff side of the road. This turned out to make the passage much more enjoyable for our trip through. The road had just opened a week or so before our arrival and the snow up at Logan's Pass was beautiful to see on the 90 degree day we were there. If you stop at one of the vistas by St. Marys lake, you will have an awesome photo op with snow capped mountains opposite the lake. The mountain goats in the snow at Logan's Pass were a highlight for our kids as was the weeping wall. A hike to Avalanche Lake would have been awesome based on all we heard but we ran out of time and just did the Cedar. Be sure to raft at the parks entrance, it was not scary and it was beautiful.

The information we recieved was that it was due to open on 26th but locals thought it might be July. The park is misnamed as it is glacier formed but only one glacier is visible from the road when opened ( I expected it to be like the Canadian Rockies).

We stopped at the visitor center, and hiked out to Hidden Lake, across snowfields in late July, with 65 degree temps in T shirts. It is a great hike, and doable for most healthy walkers. As it is at high altitude, it takes a bit of endurance, but not much elevation gain. One time we drove east on Going to the Sun, and returned to W. Glacier by Rt 2, through the Marias Pass, with a stop at the Isaak Walton Inn in Essex. A historic and beautiful building.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I have been visiting family in Montana since I was a little girl and a trip on ""the highway"" was always a favorite. I have since introduced friends and my family to the experience and every time I go it is just as exciting as the last. I have gone as a passenger and as a driver and both are equally wonderful. The vistas are magnificent. A few points to pass on:1. Don't go in the summer ""high"" season if you can help it. You will sit in a huge traffic jam that moves at a snail's pace up the steep grade. It is best to try for the ""shoulder"" seasons if your plans allow. The road will close in October as the snow falls early at this height.2. Check on-line for construction delays or closings. The road is older and under constant upgrade or repair.3. If you are afraid of heights you may want to rethink this one. The road has low barriers that allow for fantastic views but can also be a bit scary if you look down. We had to move a passenger in our car to the inside because she was afraid but my son threw open the door to our minivan and shot picture after picture out the open door. Know your limits.4. When you get to Logan Pass, stop and stretch your legs. There is a great hike up to the hidden lake look-out. You are at high elevation so take your time. This is the continental divide and the visitor center has an interesting display explaining the phenomenon.5. There is really not an opportunity to turn around once you start the climb so have a full tank of gas and commitment.6. The main lodges in Glacier Park have busses that will take you on the trip if you don't wish to make the drive on your own. They have large open windows and roofs for great viewing. I believe they also have wheelchair/stroller access.7. I have seen mountain goats and big horn sheep just a few feet from my car window. I have also seen black bear and grizzly through my binoculars.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Explaining the Going-to-the-Sun Road is just about the most impossible thing to describe. I'm sure the weather can play a huge role here, but if it cooperates, you will be given endless views of exactly what makes nature so incredible. Going during off-peak times will help with traffic, but if you plan on it taking all day anyway (which it will, and should), it won't matter too much.Take things to munch on and drinks with you. Extra batteries for the cameras. Sunglasses for the mountain glare. Most of all, take your time. There are plenty of places to park and gawk. This park is a benchmark for all other parks as far as sheer beauty. Sure, other parks boast wildlife or beaches, but nothing I've seen yet compares to Glacier's blatant assault on your eyesight. I've seen quite a few National/State parks that have fallen short in the ""Looks like a Nature Valley commercial"" department. Yellowstone makes you feel like you're coming up short in the food chain. Teddy Roosevelt National Grassland make you appreciate surviving in a strange environment.

In case you don't know, a Red is a beautiful, red, antique convertible bus - about the size of a limo. They were built by White Motor Company and put into service in the mid-thirties. Around 2000, they were temporarily taken out of service for overhaul by Ford. Along with other friends, my wife and rode on one of the 33 Reds still in service and greatly enjoyed the narrative provided by the Jammer (driver). The weather was chilly with the top rolled back, but the blankets in the bus kept the temp just right. At Glacier, being a Jammer is a real honor - and a highly coveted job.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The Going-to-the-Sun Road opened on Tuesday and my husband really wanted to go back and take it. I wasn't too sure, since I felt like maybe I had seen it. Holy Kittens of fire, was I wrong. That is where all the good stuff is.Today, we went back and saw the most spectacular views ever. Waterfalls at every turn, including on the roadways at some points. The road closes to one lane way up and people were stuck under the gushing falls. We got to St. Mary's lake in under an hour, which took us all day last week. Which was okay, we saw a lot on that trip too.If you are going, you have to go when this road is open. I wasn't sure we'd still be here when they did finally get it open. That said, we went to Logan Pass visitor center and there was plenty of snow on the ground there. People were sledding in shorts. Then we drove on for a little while longer and then turned back because we had seen the lake last weekend. Coming back there was an avalanche that was across all the lanes and rather large. We had only been gone from that area 30 minutes but they had it so you could get one car through the middle if tucked it's whiskers in. I will post a picture out the car window.I thought it was cool, until i realized that it went over the edge and thought about how you, the car and the snow all would find the bottom at some point. Fun.. lost.We did see rams on the side of road and stopped and got pictures of them. They came down in front of us and crossed the road and ran on the top of the wall that keeps your car from plummeting thousands of feet down the cliff. Despite this being a narrow roadway already, they are doing construction and bringing it down to a one lane for some distance. On the way to the east, the traffic waiting to go west was backed way up, this is where some cars had to sit under the waterfalls. On our way back west, we were the third car back from the light to let us go and it only took about ten minutes or so stopped.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"The Going-to-the-Sun road was by far the most spectacular drive I undertook this past year. I drove it in August 2012, all 53 miles from West Glacier, Montana across the Continental Divide at Logan Pass and exiting onto US-89 in St. Mary, Montana. The views were breathtaking. The Sun road was undergoing major roadwork causing lengthy delays when I drove it in August. Confined to a single lane around work areas, traffic had to be stopped in one direction or the other for extended periods. Yet nobody seemed to mind. It was a great opportunity to step out of the car, soak up the amazing scenery, snap pictures and meet fellow travelers. My ride through Glacier National Park began on a tree-lined section of the Sun road near West Glacier. The road then tracked the south shore of Lake McDonald where I stopped to enjoy the spectacular view of the lake and visit historic Lake McDonald Lodge. Back on the road again, I soon passed Avalanche Creek, drove through the West Tunnel and began climbing higher and higher into the mountains, ending up on a narrow ledge with unsurpassed views of Glacier National Park. The road continued for miles twisting and turning all the way to the summit at Logan Pass, another scenic stop on my drive. The road east of Logan Pass was just as spectacular, especially around Siyeh Creek and St. Mary Lake.","January 24, 2013",Awesome Ride,203,"Alexandria, Virginia",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Not saying the Sun road isn't good or anything, but if you just stay in the car, drive through the Sun road and leave, you miss 90% of the park. The Sun road is pretty, but at 6000ft elevation, there's not much snow to see even in early summer, so I prefer the higher Trail Ridge road in Rocky Mountain NP. However, the glacial lakes in Glacier NP are far more impressive. Although most of the beautiful lakes are at least 5mi away from the road side, the hike is very rewarding in the end. If I can only pick one thing to do in the park, I would pick a trail instead of driving the Sun road.","January 15, 2013",Glaciers NP has a lot more to offer,71,"San Jose, California",4
Going-to-the-Sun Road,I live near Whitefish so I probably take this road for granted. But at least a couple of times every summer I head up there on the Harley. Always fantastic! You certainly need to pay attention no matter what you are driving especially above the tunnel. The bike is great as you have a little more room to maneuver although I did get hit by a small falling rock once. Falling rocks are fairly common.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Detoured north on a Montana trip to check this out and were glad we did. Not the most stunning road I've ever been on in the world, but it's certainly a very pretty drive. We didn't have time to stop and hike, but there seemed to be some really nice walks which we'd have loved to have done. Only drawback -- and we knew this would be the case -- it was the end of the school holidays in the US, so it doesn't take a genius to work out that the place would be packed. And it was. The visitor centres were jammed with people who were all road-ragey trying to get into the parking lot. We got in, used the bathrooms and fled as soon as possible. I would imagine going there on the off-season would be a much better option. Also, we'd packed sandwiches and water so didn't have to eat in a restaurant. Instead, we pulled into a picnic area and sat by Lake McDonald with our packed lunch, happily splashing our feet and lying in the sunshine. We heard some people whining about the haziness of the view, but that was due to forrest fires burning not far away. Can't blame the road for that, and it actually made for kind of a neat experience.

We were blessed with bright blue skies and warm weather. The road is far wider and more paved than I expected. The construction crew only had less than a mile to pave and we had to wait 30 minutes for an escort through the gravel. There were fewer travelers than I had expected too. We took plenty of photos, but they do not do justice to the vistas: You must go and see for yourself. Be sure to watch for cattle in the road on the eastern side reservation land. The entire route took less than 3 hours. We met lots of park visitors on Sept 17th who were sorely disappointed to be a day late!

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Soaring mountain peaks, mountain goats and big horn sheep, cascading water in June and July, wildflowers in July and August, berries in September. The first 24 miles from West Glacier headed east is through the trees and along the shore of Lake McDonald and then McDonald Creek. After The Loop switchback, it becomes a 20 mph narrow road with a major dropoff on the other side of a short rock curb. The road has been rebuilt and repaved over the past several years and is in excellent condition. The vistas are spectacular and shouldn't be missed. The road should be driven all the way over Logan Pass to East Glacier as the scenery is very different on the two sides. You should also drive both ways as you see different things each direction. There is a free shuttle service with frequent buses that go all the way across. It's better to use the shuttles and enjoy the trip than drive it scared and see nothing. You're going to want to stop along the way and it's so easy to do with the shuttles. There are times in August when the Logan Pass parking lot is full and one can't stop there. Look for sheep and goats grazing next to the parking lot at Logan Pass. Because the sun sets late up here in the north, try driving it in the evening after the campers and lodge guests have gone in for the night. It's quiet and we always see wildlife when we drive it just after the road has opened for the summer or in September before it closes. There are also some beautiful sunsets driving east to west.

Pull over and enjoy the natural lakes, streams and wilderness. The Mountains are solemn as a background to everything. The whole area is so relaxing and calm. We saw a mother bear and two cubs playing in a field, just loafing. It is truly beautiful country that looks like a post card around every corner. Words and pictures do not do it justice.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,The most scenic 52 miles of road in the USA (maybe the world) is Going-to-the-Sun. It stands as one of the greatest engineering feats of the last century. It is best viewed west to east and the scenery is jaw dropping. The road is only open a few months of the year and there is constant road work on some section of the road. This is a plus as you get to stop and get out to view sights of such natural beauty that may bring you to tears while you wait. Most of the parking areas (especially Logan Pass) fill up fast so start early or take the red bus tour which is well worth the cost. This is an all day trip as you must stop at each lodge and take a few of the hikes. If you are hiking bear spray is a good idea and easily found at all the shops in and around the park.

The drops from the side of the road are huge and there is often little in the way of barriers, so while it is not difficult to drive, confidence with heights is a good thing.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Accessing Glacier NP from the west, you really have no choice but to drive along some portion of Going-to-the-Sun-Road; that's a good thing. Realize that it will take you roughly an hour to drive from West Glacier up to Logan Pass. Along the way, there are plenty of nice stops to view Lake McDonald, the feeder stream entering from the north and McDonald Falls. Further up the road is Trail of Cedars which is almost universally accessible and a nice, 0.7 mile loop hike on a boardwalk. Once you get to Logan Pass I would recommend two options (both if you can manage). With younger kids I would recommend Hidden Lake nature trail; 3 miles round trip with nice snow, water and animal sightings. For a more adventurous route, chose the Highline Trail. Even if you only do the first mile and turn around, its worth it. Amazing views. The Logan Pass parking lot can fill up but it is also accessbile by the bus system.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This is one of the most scenic drives I've ever taken. The whole road is one continuous Kodak moment. Breathtaking views, lush wildflowers even this far into the summer. Plan on taking a few hours, not because the traffic is bad but because there is so much to see. Luckily the road construction presented a minimal interruption but always check before a trip--tourist season is also construction season in places like Glacier. The only downside was at the top--Logan Pass and the visitor center. Parking is woefully inadequate (unless you're on a motorcycle); I had to park in a pullout 2/3 of a mile from the top and walk back and forth. Much of that was in the road because there's either no shoulder or what's there isn't suitable for walking.

The Big Horn Sheep are difficult to spot, even when someone is trying to point them out to you. We spotted a grizzly bear about 50 yds from the road. But it was in the final few miles of our drive on the east side and there aren't as many ""high value"" sights, so keep your eyes open. Take a picnic lunch and enjoy it on the cliffs overlooking St Mary lake. When you have completed the drive, you can turn around to get back to the Kalispell side, or you can take highways 89>49>2 to go south and below the park.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,We drove this once and took the shuttle once. Take the shuttle.

And it's free!,"August 19, 2012",Take the free shuttle,55,"Vancouver, BC",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Forgive us, but my husband and I are not hikers or campers. We took this road because it's the only road through the heart of Glacier and since we weren't going to hike or camp or do anything that even resembled exertion, this was our chance to see Glacier. (Yes, you may call the NPS and have my passport revoked.)It's not for the faint of heart or for the inexperienced or nervous drivers. If you don't like sheer drop offs or narrow, winding roads- take the shuttle up. The ""guard rails"" are just large stones, which in my mind, became fulcrums. As in, if I hit one in my truck, it wouldn't prevent me from falling over the edge, it would just help my truck tip over. When we drove it, a lot of the road was under construction and gravel with no lane markings. It was also wet in spots from the melting ice and snow cascading down the mountain. Due to the construction, you will be stopped along some parts of the road but we never waited long. I liked this because, as the driver, I got a chance to actually look at the scenery (which, by the way, is absolutely beautiful. Possibly the most gorgeous on the planet.) and check my blood pressure. We drove the road west to east because this way most of the switch backs are uphill and not downhill. I would prefer to be going up a hill driving switchbacks than careening downhill and doing them; I feel like I have more control on the uphill. That being said, if you drive the road west to east, you will be on the OUTSIDE of the mountain. Use the bathrooms before you drive it, because the bathrooms are few and far between on the road and pretty scary in themselves (the only dirty bathrooms we saw in a National Park) and also because you're less likely to wet your pants with an empty bladder on a scary, narrow road. The thing that really frightened me wasn't so much the road as it was some of the other drivers on it. Be prepared for other drivers, white knuckles and white as a sheet faces a showin', edging into your lane or otherwise completely ignoring good driving sense. Also, we got the added bonus of being stuck in a ""OMG! It's a mountain goat! Holy Cow! Let me take 500 pictures of him on my i-phone before moving along"" traffic jam. That was nice, too, because I like mountain goats. We got out of the car and one particularly desensitized-to-humans-goat walked within four feet of us. Of course, he may have been rabid, but we didn't stay to find out. Take a jacket, a scarf, a hat, and wear your union suit under your clothes because, as you're on top of a mountain, it gets pretty cold up there even in July. I would drive the road again, in a heartbeat. It was an awesome, beautiful experience.","August 19, 2012",Not for the Faint of Heart,65,"Baltimore, Maryland",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,Going to the Sun Road is Amazing. We were very lucky. It was a mild winter and thus the road opened very early in full on June 2oth two days before we had to leave. Next time I would not take this chance. I would my plan to be there the second half of July to make sure the road was open. Many people we met had to leave before June 20th and were extremely disapointed. We got the last parking space in the Logan Pass Visitor center at around noon. Again we were very lucky. If I did this again I would try to arrive at the Visitor enter before 10 A.M. and on a weekday. The road is not as scary or dangerous as some people had mentioned. Just drive slowly and carefully and you will be fine. Be sure to do the hike behind the visitor center.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I was excited to drive through Going-to-the-Sun Road but was left a little disappointed. It was nobody's fault really (maybe mine?) but the entire Glacier National Park was enveloped in a haze so I couldn't really see anything. It was strange because it looked like haze from air pollution but air pollution shouldn't be *that* bad around that area and I didn't see any forest fire around. Just curious, can someone explain to me the source of the haze? My drive was a total bust, I think I took ONE photo the entire trip.So here are some tips for you:1) Go to this page http://www.nps.gov/glac/planyourvisit/conditions.htm and check out the web cams under the ""smoke and haze"" section before you go.2) Go early in the morning to avoid the crowd, parking lot at view points are often full.3) Better yet, leave your car behind and take the FREE shuttle provided by the park that goes through the road and back.4) Start the drive from St. Mary (from East to West) instead of West Glacier if possible. Starting from St. Mary will be much easier for the driver as it is a down hill drive. You don't want to start from West Glacier going up hill through winding mountain roads, you'd have to pay much more attention driving instead of enjoying the view.5) Vehicles over 20' are prohibited.Have a good trip!","August 8, 2012",know before you go...,18,"Seattle, WA",3

We visited in a peak tourist time, late July, but even then found it tremendously worthwhile. Get an early start to the day if you want to park and hike at Logan Pass (highest point on the road). It takes 2-3 hours to do the whole road, both because of slow traffic and because of construction delays. We drove both ways (on separate days). We did not have trouble parking at most scenic stops except for Avalanche Creek -- we tried 4 times on that one and never found a parking space. We could have taken a shuttle from Lake McDonald but chose not to. Definitely do at least part of the Logan Pass hike if you can; it's the highlight of the trip. (But bring hiking sticks or ski poles if the route is snow-covered...and it was, even in late July).

Visiting a few weeks just before everything closes is when the crowds are not too bad, weather is still nice, very few bugs and unbelieveable scenery everywhere and not many other tourist!Left GNP and headed North to Lake Louise. What a beautiful drive looking at all those high peaks unfolding as you get closer and closer to the Canadian Rockies. Stayed in the most economical room we could find at LL and drove to Banff the next day to visit the hot springs and the hotel...very nice! Left LL for the ice fields hwy but weather was overcast and drizzle. Turned around and stopped at Moose Lake and Lake Peyto (One of the 10 prettiest Lks in the World!) before spending 2 nights at Emerald Lake near Field, BC...breathtakingly beautiful.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"If you haven't driven Going to the Sun Road, you haven't lived. It is a truly breathtaking experience that is meant to be done slowly or over several times. You have to stop; you have to get out of your car; you have to breathe deeply; you have to enjoy the silence, or the feel of the breeze, or the sound of rushing water or the sight of a mountain goat ewe and her lamb. You have to look up, then down, then over, then back, then forward. You may have to stop and wait a while since they're rebuilding the road and some stretches are down to one lane but why let that bother you? It's just an excuse to get out of the car and take it in all over again. When was the last time you gave yourself permission to slow down and take it all in? This road demands that of you.

The road isn't nearly as steep or scary as I had been led to believe. It was fascinating to see how well this road had been surveyed and constructed!

Once you reach Logan's Pass you have several hiking options. Our favorite is to hike the Highline Trail from Logan's Pass to the Loop. It's a day hike so plan accordingly. It is generally pretty easy to hitch a ride to Logan's Pass so we usually park at the loop. If would are not comfortable hitchhiking then you can always pay for the shuttle service.

After having entered from West Glacier and traveled the road Eastward, we found the last 10 miles or so to the East gate was a bit boring. We did drive all the way to the East gate and then made the call to head back to West Glacier via the park instead of going the long way around on regular highway. We do not regret doing this as the views running the opposite direction were much different making it worth the round-trip on the GTS road. We ate picnic lunch at the pass while enjoying the scenery and the wild bighorn sheep that are nearby... very breathtaking. Also, take the short hike out to the glacier that's directly behind the visitor's center at the pass, it's well worth it.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Glacier National Park is beautiful! Its way up north in the Montana, almost to Canada so you have to drive a long way to get there.We chose to go in late June because their National Park Service website said that July & August are the busiest months & more people visit during those 2 months than all the other 10 months combined! Going to the Sun road is under construction for the next several years and we had one way traffic only in a long section so I bet it would be a huge hassle with crowds. However, due to the snow – the Going to the Sun road does not open fully until late June so check the website and plan accordingly. We were lucky it opened all the way through the park only a few days before we arrived. There was still plenty of snow at Logan’s Pass but the amazing waterfalls everywhere due to the melting snow were fabulous and made the end of June the perfect time to visit in our opinion!We entered through the St. Mary side and drove Going to the Sun Road toward Lake McDonald as we were staying the night in Kalispell. We also wanted to drive from the east toward the west side because their website says if we travelled west to east on Going to the Sun road that….”Heading east toward Logan Pass and St. Mary from the West Entrance, passengers on the passenger side of the vehicle will be able to look over the edge of the road in a few spots.” This sounded a bit scary to me & I felt more comfortable being along the mountain side & not the edge side of the road.I feel we made a wise choice because the scenery was more spectacular on the St Mary side than the Lake McDonald side due to the thick trees in the way of views on the west side.Attached are 14 pictures of our journey along Going to the Sun Road through Glacier National Park in late June 2012.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Exceptional with no problems what so ever! I remember reading that this is not the only thing to do when you visit this park, however, you can't miss it and who would want to. We drove from the East entrance and took a boat tour at St. Mary's Lake to the West and enjoyed the fireworks in Whitefish on July 4th. We got to see more of McDonald Lake on the return trip and spent some time hiking various trails. We had a four year old with us, so the falls close to St. Mary's Lake required caution for that age. Beautiful weather and fabulous scenery. I have visited many state parks and this is one of the best.","July 19, 2012",Going to the Sun Road,14,"Pomona, California",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,We had the opportunity to take the Going-to-the Sun Road on three different occasions this trip. Each day was different from the next. The stops along the way were just georgeous and unbelievable. If one can drive the Sun Road early when traffic is at a minimum. The road is undergoing some heavy duty maintenance and stops can be up to 20 to 30 minutes at times.Just stop and enjoy the sights around you. Make sure you stop at some of the many sights along the way. Hiking trails are of all different lengths. Do not rush the drive.

You can do this road on your own or you can take a red bus tour from one of the hotels, but for the $200 price tag of the Red Bus, I'd suggest renting a car for the day and driving yourselves. You can stop at the Logan's Pass rest area and then on to one of the lodges for lunch or dinner and then return to your starting point on US 2 (East or West).

For the amount of money you must pay to enter te park and to camp at night, we at least expected the bathrooms to have running water or soap, but no such luck here. The campgrounds had few facilites and amenities and even the most popular and visited visitor's center (Logan pass) did not have soap or hand washing sinks. Also the hiking trails in many places was almost completly overgrown. In order to get firewood, you have to completely leave the park as well.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"My family visited Glacier National Park for the first time on July 5, 2012 and stayed 4 days. Our first time on this road was on Friday, July 5th in the morning and it was simply beautiful and spectacular. However, you must be VERY patient, as this drive took about 3-3 1/2 hour simply driving with very little stop gong from the West to the East. Most of the time, you are behind cars that have stopped to take pictures and you'll need to deal with construction delays. Also, most places had no parking available as it was very crowded. The most jaw dropping part of this trip is on the west end driving up to Logan Pass. On our last day, we drove from the east end (St. Mary) to the west end, starting at 5 pm. It only took 1 1/2 hours and it is in the early evening that the wild life can be seen more abundantly. The goats and rams were out and they were simply adorable. Also there were parking every where you want to stop. As sunset is about 9:30 pm, I highly recommend making the drive in the early evening instead.","July 14, 2012",Simply Spectacular!,17,"Seattle, WA",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"My wife, son, and I made the voyage from the Tetons/Yellowstone to Glacier, primarily to drive the Going-to-the-sun road. We were not disappointed. I would give yourself a full day (though we started VERY early before the crowds) to make the drive. The weather was a bit unpredictable and rained/sprinkled most of the morning so we returned for a second day and drove to Logan Pass when it was more clear.The construction was really reasonably managed and the workers were pleasant and explained how long the wait would be (10-20 minutes). It was interesting to see some convertibles (audi's, corvettes, etc). driving through some rough road and gravel but you could make the drive in any car. Logan's pass was still rather snowed in so we weren't able to do any hiking as we planned. Once past Logan's pass on the east side of the continental divide, the views were amazing. We didn't make our way up to Many Glacier due to timing and our accommodations were back in West Glacier, but it was well worth going to the Sun Point area. Much past there is honestly much of the same. We saw NO wildlife - or atleast large mammals, which was a huge surprise in comparison to the Tetons/Yellowstone.NOTE: if you are planning to drive between the parks, it is a huge drive through primarily small towns and ranches. The Grants-Kohrs NHS is a good stopping point. We stayed in West Glacier - see our other review of Glacier Guides Lodge (worth the drive itself).","July 14, 2012",Amazing drive: up up up and down down down,16,"Pittsburgh, PA",4
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"If you don't like heights, don't drive this road! But the scenery is breathtakingly spectacular, so maybe try the shuttle instead of driving it yourself so you don't miss the opportunity of a lifetime. Gorgeous views nearly the entire road, but only a short wall (and sometimes nothing) between you and eternity. Construction on the highest parts of the drive cause delays, but that is good for scaredy folks to catch one's breath! At Logan's Pass there is a wonderful NP lodge with a mini-museum and lots to purchase for souvenirs. Best to drive east to west if you are afraid of heights, because that way you are on the inside next to the mountain. West to east keeps you on the outside edge the entire way. Lots of shuttle busses and tour vans winding around the mountain, so no need to freak out if driving on mountain roads gives you wet pants!","July 13, 2012","Gorgeous scenic views, terrifying drive!",25,"Grass Valley, California",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"My cousin and I drove the GTS Road and it was just amazing. We went there on a sunny day and just two days after the summit at Logan Pass had opened. The road on the western end starts out pretty tame, but as you gain altitude it gets smaller and tighter - you are driving right next to the edge of some significant drop offs. I felt safe the entire time - fellow drivers were pretty nice and everyone seemed to somehow have their eyes on the road in spite of the scenery. There are many, many spots to pull over and take pictures or just breath in the delicious air. What was most significant to me was how INsignificant I felt - looking around at the mountains just makes you feel incredibly minute.We didn't get to see to much wildlife - but even though we barely strayed from the Road we did see a black bear and a few mountain goats. We stopped at the Visitor's Center at Logan Pass and stood outside to admire the view - and the 12""+ of snow that was there!

We took our drive, from east to west, on the third day it was open. We had absolutely gorgeous weather, blue sunny skies, incredible mountain vistas. So much snow left, like we have never seen before ( this is our fourth visit). And with so much snow left, and melting going on, the waterfalls were amazing and everywhere!! There was construction going on, but it really did not seem to hold us up too long. We had lunch in Apgar, and then came back across. Different views on the way back, and with the sun behind us on both legs of the trip, we got amazing photos. We had three cameras going, trying to capture everything we were seeing from every angle.

As the road climbs the views become even more expansive and it seems that after each of the many hairpins the spectacular views get even better. If the weather is clear the air is so fresh and clean. Allow a good 2 - 3 hours to do the road as it gets very busy and often the car park at the visitor center at Logans Pass is rammed by lunchtime. We have done the trip twice and if you go around 8am its quiet and again late in the day is good. From the visitor center there is a lovely short hike to Hidden Lake. Most days you see bighorn sheep and mountain goats somehow clinging to to the cliffs perched high above you as you drive along. If you are really lucky you may see bears.

Unfortunately we drove past what we think was Flathead Lake in the late evening and didn't get to stop and see what looked like numerous places to stop along the way. The majority of towns, and things to do are on the west side of the state. Once you cross the Going to the Sun road, there are not as many town or cities on the other side it seems. We would have liked to do a bit more around Kalispel Whitefish area before crossing over, but it was still great. Pack a cooler with plenty of water and some sandwiches. We got stuck in a bit of traffic (construction) and were glad to have some refreshments. The views and photo opportunities are are every corner. Just awesome. When you get to the top, make sure you plan enough time to take the path that leads up the the glacier. We didn't get to hike to Grinnel Lake, but want to go back to do that. When you get to East Glacier. Its a tiny town and is kinda quaint, but unless you stay at the awesome Wilderness Lodge, your choices are limited. Check out my other reviews about where NOT to stay.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We were so disappointed when we got to 20 miles form the St Mary entrance on the East side when it started snowing like crazy. We couldn't see a thing. The weather went from beautiful to treacherous in a heartbeat. The East side was eerie, everything was closed. We cut our loss, turned around and left for the west entrance. Roads on the East side did not seem to be as well maintained. The West side was gorgeous but we cold only make it to avalanche because they were still plowing. They plow from the middle out but you can still access 16 miles form the West side and about 13 from the East side so you only miss the middle part. Still worth seeing even if you don't get to see the whole thing. Didn't see any wildlifeI am petrified in the car when someone else is driving but didn't get white knuckles as some other reviewers referred to however we didn't make it past Avalanche so that may be the reason why since the elevation is higher after Avalanche. Lake McDonald is gorgeous and the views are different and just as beautiful on the way in as they are on the way out. There is a beautiful river at Avalanche where we had to turn around. I could have spent the whole day just sitting there in silence. The rocks are colorful, the water clear and the area was so quiet and peaceful. I left a small stack of rocks on a log for a photo op.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"No one should miss all there is to see and do at Glacier National Park (Montana), but Going to the Sun Road should be at the top of the list, if you don't do anything else. The scenary is amazing, especially to the west of Logan's Pass (the Continental Divide). The driving might be a bit white-knuckled, but the park's shuttle service is free although they are not guided tours. The Red Jammer tours have wonderful guides and stop for all photo-ops-- and if the weather is nice, they'll put the top down for even better pictures.Plan on spending a whole day covering the Going to the Sun Road. Even if you don't hike any trails, there are lots of things to stop and see as well as a few gift shops and lodges. You can pack a lunch to eat at Logan's Pass, and there are some very easy trails that practically guaruntee the opportunity to see mountain goats and sheep, marmots, chipmunks and who knows what else.The road usually opens around June 15th, after the plowing is done, but if there is heavier than usual snowfall in the winter, the road may not open until later in the year (it 2011 it didn't open until July 13th). The admission fee into the park for a 2 axle vehicle is around $20; a season's pass is about $30.Be sure to bring sunscreen, bug spray, WATER, snacks, a hat and sunglasses. A sweatshirt or jacket is also recommended as well as an umbrella. The weather is very unpredictable. It could be 80° (even with several feet of snow on the ground) or it could be cold, wet and/or windy. And don't forget film/disks and to charge your camera battery or bring extra batteries!","May 18, 2012",Fantastic Place to go,224,"Sweetgrass, Montana",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Hiking and views galore, too numerous to write here. Not to be missed, though! Make sure the pass is open before you go - usually by late June.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I guess Going To The Sun Road is OK. This is only for people who enjoy stunning vistas, humorous and friendly mountain goats, and engineering wonders. WARNING, if you go early in the season you will be forced to sit and wait for 10-15 minutes at a time due to yearly road construction. You will be compelled to leave the safety of your car and sit and gaze at the once in a lifetime scenery. You will actually begin to enjoy traffic jams and road construction, this may be a disturbing experience to some people.","April 15, 2012",I Guess this is OK,25,"Carlisle, Pennsylvania",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"First, I love Glacier National Park. It is a jewel in our National Park system. As for the Going-to-the-Sun Road, it is a must drive. The road is quite the engineering marvel, especially knowing when it was built. The road is not a fast drive. Expect traffic and limited ability to pass slow moving vehicles. But who cares when you have the spectacular panoramas. If you need to make time, take US 2 which skirts the southern border of the park and avoid this road. You get completely different views whichever way you drive. Both ways offer amazing views, but if you can only drive one way, I prefer the east to west drive. The vistas are more open heading up to Logan Pass and you still get very good views of the park on the downhill side. There are plenty of pull outs and view points along the way, plus some hiking opportunities. If you can only make one stop, I recommend Logan Pass. It is not unusual to have mountain goats roaming around the top of the pass.Here is my warning, if you have issues with tight and/or curvy roads plus a fear of drop offs, then you may want to think twice about making the drive all the way over. Going east to west, you will not have drop offs on your way up to Logan Pass. Once you go over the pass, you will begin with the Garden Wall on your right, but as you wind down the road, you will start to have some drop offs. Going west to east, you have few drop offs on the way to Logan Pass. However, the last pull approaching the top does have a severe drop. Once you cross the pass, you will have no mountain walls on your right. The severe drop offs are limited and are not as startling as the west side of the pass. You can still make a drive up part of the road and turn around. You won’t be disappointed, even with that limited exposure.","April 15, 2012",Amazing!!,201,"Athens, Georgia",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We visited Glacier in late August. It was busy, but not overly so. It took us about 7 hours (including hikes) to do all of Going-to-the Sun Road. Had we done all the hikes we had planned, it would have taken several more hours. Honestly, we could have stretched just GTTS into several days (and probably should have). Without stops, we could have done it in about 4.5 hours. There were pockets of construction, but the back-ups were minimal. The road is supposed to be incredibly narrow, and it's true that the drop-offs probably aren't for the faint-of-heart, but it really isn't that bad at all. I wouldn't be keen on driving it in an RV, but our SUV was fine. I recommend driving the road yourself. The jammers are cool, but they're expensive and you don't have control over stops. Around every bend is a vista that was somehow more breathtaking than the one before and we loved being able to pull over when and where we wanted. No matter how well you plan, you will end up making additional stops that aren't marked in the guide books. We made a number of those stops. When you see a half dozen cars parked along the side of the road, you kind of figure you might be missing something good, so you pull over, too. All of our impromptu stops were excellent, especially one at a little swimming hole. (My husband dove right in; I skipped the 45 degree swim.)More suggestions: Bring extra camera batteries and memory cards. We needed both. Had the camera on for almost all seven hours. Plan appropriately - bathrooms and/or water are at only a few hiking stops. There are great visitor centers at St. Mary, Logan Pass, and Apgar. They are all different, so it's worth a stop at each. And definitely make sure kids have a chance to do the Junior Ranger program. Lots of fun!","April 5, 2012",Truely the Crown of the Continent,388,"Grand Rapids, MI",5

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We went to Glacier National Park last year and had so much fun that we are going back there this summer too! We were on the going to the sun road when we saw a deer on the side of the road. So we pulled over and took pictures and the deer walked right up to us and let us pet him and then he licked our hands and arms and we were just so overwhelmed by how brave and trusting he was. We could have kissed him on the cheek if we had thought to do so. But after petting him for about 20 minutes, he was bored with our attention and the fact that many other people were pulling over and he didn't like the fact it was getting to crowded so he ran out into the street. My husband had to chase him out of the way of traffic so he would not get hit by an oncoming car. The deer ran up the mountain side and out of sight. We will treasure those moments with our deer forever. We are so looking forward to going back to Glacier National Park again this summer. I just hope we don't run into any beers :)","March 31, 2012","We actually got to touch a deer on the going to the sun road, WOW!!!!",6,"Kennewick, Washington",5

We tried to go to the other side of the park and drive more of the Going to the Sun road, but we feel as if we missed so much! However, the sights we did see we're breathtaking. Be sure you have your camera on this visit. Some people in front of us on a hike saw a bear, but unfortunately we weren't that lucky.

Great for cars not RV's as narrows down to 1 or 1 1/2 lanes at times with a useless stone guard rail, steep grades at times ( start with full gas tanks ) but a Motorcycle dream road too. Views similar to exotic European Alps mountain roads. Out of the way area but worth the effort for a memorable road trip segment. Not for the faint of heart if you don't like driving on cliff edges....some people got part way in and freaked out so park staff drove them out.There is a large Park service senter at the 1/2 way point but for washrooms, info but load up with gas supplies before you enter the park as not much to fall back on","March 19, 2012",Most Amazing Drive,603,"Ontario, Canada",5

One thing I will say that is if you are going to go on this drive in the winter make sure you have 4 wheel drive, or a front wheel drive car with good tires and traction control. Just because the road is ok to drive on doesn't mean it is cleared, the whole way we drive on packed snow and ice. It wasn't hazardous, but would be if you didn't have the proper car.

The summit or the visitors centre is at the top and is about a half way point....... so if you need to use the washroom do it there. In July ( usually) the road opens to visitors and is a perfect time to go as there are amazing waterfalls and wildflowers along side huge snow banks!! Also if you are travelling on a motor bike this will be one of the funnest and most beautiful little rides you will take. The summit can be cool so bring a jacket. Trust me when I say just go!!

Speed limit is just right. Slow enough to look if you happen to be the driver; yet fast enough to get you to the other side of the park. Lots of curvy roads. Construction was going on the entire time we were there on both lanes of this road. The longest we ever had to stop was about 20 minutes. We took this road about 8 times during our stay. WE took highway 2 (I think it was 2) around the bottom of the park. That took about 1 1/2 hours to get to West Glacier going that way and St Marys. I prefer the Going to The Sun Road because even if you have to stop for construction; the views are just breathtaking and you really dont mind having to stop.

On our hike we saw mountain goats grazing nonchalantly, oblivious to the passing hikers. The reward at trail's end is a spectacular view of HiddenLake.

It was as if the mountains had their heads in the clouds. Very enjoyable. We were a bit disappointed not to see as much wildlife as we had hoped. The state of Montana is supposed to have the largest population of bears in the lower 48 states, but we didn't see any. We only saw five deer, two chipmunks and a few magpies and yellow-rumped warblers.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This 50 mile roadway through Glacier National Park took 8 hours to travel and would have taken longer if there had been parking available at Logan Pass. We entered the park from the east early in the day, stopped at the tourist information center for maps and suggestions on which trails to hike, and made our first stop at Baren Falls. We weren't sure about continuing from this point on the trail to St. Mary Falls because there were few hikers in the vicinity and we didn't want to encounter a bear along the way. So we hopped in the car and drove on down the highway to the lookout point at Wild Goose Island. When we arrived at the trailhead at St. Mary Falls there were numerous cars and hikers so we felt it less likely we'd meet up with a grizzly. We hiked about .5 mile to St. Mary Falls, then continued on to Virginia Falls. The return hike is about 3.6 miles. Exhilerating exercise and spectacular views. The only problem about taking a car along the Sun Road is that the driver must watch the road and misses a lot of the scenery.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"Just a spectacular drive... the terrain begins as a heavy forrest from the West side with a speed limit of 40 mph. After a few miles you'll loose many of the trees and be driving on the edge of mountains with a 25 mph limit. On the East side, the drive is again in a wooded area and the speed limit is 40 mph. Much of the road is posted as no passing, so always give yourself at least two hours to complete the 52 miles..... The traffic is minimal early (before 8:00) but can be bumper to bumper by 10... I began my trip in late August and left in September. .... Road Closings!!! Always check with the Glacier NPS before coming to the park...I prefer a amaller car on this road as it is very narrow!

Going-to-the-Sun Road,Glacier National Park is absolutely breathtaking and you'll be amazed by the Going-to-the-Sun Road.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"This year's greater than average snowfall had an impact on our trip to GNP, but we made the most of it and just barely got to drive All of the Going to the Sun Road. Don't fail to enjoy this part of the trip. Plowing was still being done during early July, and the middle section of the road was closed to traffic. During that time, the park service ran small shuttles from the Lake Avalanche parking lot to the Loop. We got there early and enjoyed the two miles of GTTSR beyond the Loop that were open to pedestrians. What a great opportunity! I highly encourage anyone visiting the park to make the most of what's available while you are there. We spent two days doing what we could along the open section of the road on the west side of the park. Then, we drove Highway 2 around the southern end of the park to the east side. Once there, we spent three days doing as much as we could along the section of road open on the eastern side (as well as the Many Glacier/Swiftcurrent area). Finally, on our last day in the park, July 13, the middle section of the road opened -- I'm so glad that we didn't miss it! The views are fantastic! We didn't even complain about the stops caused by the construction/road repair -- those stops provided opportunities to get out of the car, enjoy the views, and take photographs without having to look for a pullout with available parking. We did not have any qualms driving GTTSR; all of the drivers are wanting the same thing -- to enjoy the views, so don't feel pushed or hurried -- just enjoy the drive.","August 25, 2011","Amazing Road, Spectacular Views!",1064,"Nashville, Tennessee",5

We had at least 3 construction waits, which was only an issue as we were trying to get to Many Glacier for boat reservations. If you are trying to get to the East side of the park, try taking Hwy 2 around the southern park border into East Glacier or up to Many Glacier. The trip from St. Mary's entrance to Kalispell took 2 hours.

The road was finally opened July 13 2011 for full travel through the park after a tiresome effort by the snow removal crews after Glacier Park was hammered this past winter with snow. Without their effort, we would not have seen such beautiful landscapes from Logan Pass. Thanks snow gang ! As for the road it is narrow in some locations so it is best if your driver is paying attention and not looking around. Sucks to be the driver. It's up to his passengers to let him know what he is missing. Once at Logan Pass he can take it in at the visitor center. Keep an eye out for Big Horn Sheep at Logan Pass.

There are times you drive through cutouts in the mountain wall and wind around sharp turns with only a railing between you and the drop. I never felt particularly afraid while driving. Construction happens, especially in evening, so you want to be past the construction before certain hours. The road may be closed as late as June due to snow and avalanches, so you really must check and plan ahead. It only takes about 2 hours to drive without stopping, but stopping is what makes really makes it worth it. Even in August, I saw leftover glacial/snow mounds bigger than buses just feet from the road. Particularly when you get to the area where you get a good view of the Crown of the Continent.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"My husband and I took a road trip to Glacier National Park and back. A few disappointments, one being that the Going-to-the-Sun-Road was not scheduled to open until July 13. We were there two days too early. Due to the record breaking snowfall this last winter, it was the latest opening date since 1933. We drove the 15.5 miles from the West Entrance to Avalanche, and 13.5 miles from the St. Mary Entrance to Jackson Glacier Overlook. The section of the road between Avalanche and Jackson Glacier Overlook was closed. The trip around was slow because of road work. Nevertheless, all the scenery was gorgeous.","July 26, 2011","Dissapointed that the complete road was not open, but gorgeous just the same.",52,"Newark, California",4

To just drive the road start to finish would probably take close to three hours. The road is very narrow and you have to drive slow. Expect lots of tourist and wildlife jams.I love the mountain goats. Have seen them every visit near the top of the pass.This road is not always open so make sure to do research!","July 18, 2011",One of the Best Places on Earth.,37,Alberta,5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"It's my understanding that with the road still not fully open, that GNP has set a record for the latest date in opening the road up end to end. We came in with the expectation that this was a possibility.Given that, we did the next best thing. We parked the car and hiked it up for as far as they would let us. That's right, even though the road was closed to cars, the park allows you to walk the road several miles up. You still can't go to the most beautiful spots at the very top, but you get to experience the road in a very personal way. You are up close to all of the beautiful streams and waterfalls coming from the snowmelt above. We were very lucky because there were very few fellow hikers. Most people opted for the Avalanche Trail, we said, we'll do that another day. Let's walk the Going to the Sun Road!!On the way up, we ran into a deer. On the way back, we actually ran into a black bear. It was a little thrilling for a moment. He was actually right in front of us. We were not comfortable just walking past it, not knowing what was on his mind. So we waited. In a short while, a cyclist rode by and gave us the advice of just shouting at him as we walked by. Easy for him to say, because he was on a bike. So we waited some more. Just then, one of the park's trucks drove by which startled our little friend, enough to move him to the side of the road. We then slipped by cautiously.I am so thankful we had this experience. If the road had been open to cars, we would have missed this moment. P.S. We did the same walk from the east side of the park too. It was even more beautiful and remote from that side. So, even though the famous road was closed, it was still worth visiting, at least from our perspective.","July 1, 2011",July 1st and the road is still closed...not the end of the world..,150,"Chicago, IL",5

The NPS website never really said the GTS road was open, They had earlier said that they tried to open it by Memorial day. We bet they would, and lost. The road was open only for 16 ""under construction"" miles from W. Glacier to Avalanche. This was very disappoining to me as this was my ""bucket trip"" attraction to see in Glacier.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We saw the videos and the photos of all the great views. We should have stopped with that. Instead we paid $150.00 for the all day tour via the famous Red Buses. That day the ceiling dropped to 2,000 feet. So we could see nothing above 2,000 feet. It rained. We could not lower the tops of the busses. Then the fog came in. We had driver/guide who said things like ""On your left, if you could see through the fog, you wold see a great waterfall."" And ""On your left, if you could see throught the fog and rain, you would see one of the oldest glaciers in North America,"" Well, we couldn't see through the fog and rain. The tickets are NON-REFUNDABLE. They also must be bought in advance. After our miserable trip we learned from staff at the lodge and a ranger that bad weather is very common in that part of the park and that many trips are ruined. That is why the fare is not refundable. We felt that we had been ripped off by the tour company. They know very well that the weather is rotten many, many days in the park. So beware.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"We decided to do a trip out west from Minnesota and included Glacier National Park and the going to the sun road. After research I found out that if I drove it from east to west I would be mostly on the mountain side of the road. That suits me perfectly as I don't like driving on the edge of steep terrain! The drive was wonderful and I'm so glad I decided to start on the east side of the park! We drove through on June 30th. We got to Logan's Pass around 10:30 a.m. and there were very few cars there at that time. I read that it fills up by 11 but perhaps we were still early in the season. There were mountain goats seen from the boardwalk when we stopped at the first pull out after Logan's Pass. Then, they came closer to the parking area and soon there were 5 of them slowly looking around at us.

Going-to-the-Sun Road,"My daughter and I have just come back from a trip to Canada and Waterton Lakes National Park during which we drove most of the Going to the Sun road. This is something that is a Must See/Do on any trip in this part of the world. It is simply breathtaking. The scenery is absolutely stunnng. It is imkpossible to take a bad photo. We were fortunate in many ways that due to a late winter, there was still a lot of snow about on the roadside and considerable snow at Logan Pass - this was very exciting. The road is very good despite the snow and there is no snow on the road itself as it has all been cleared. 10 days prior to our arrival the whole road had been closed due to heavy snow. If you are driving make sure you get on the road early as the roads get quite congested. We left Waterton National park at 8am and were on the GTTS road by about 9:30 ish. No problems at the USA border although we found it quite intimidating. They ask so many questions. There are only a few places to get petrol so fill up before you go. Also, be warned at the moment there is construction on the road past Logan Pass (heading west) and if you go during the week you can be held up for up to 4 hours. that's right 4 hours, and there's almost nowhere to turn around. My advice - go on the weekend when they aren't working on the site and the wait is only about 30 mins, or turn back shortly after Logan Pass if you're coming from Waterton. The best views are just before and after Logan Pass (for about 1 mile) so you can turn back knowing you've seen the best of the road. Allow plenty of time to drive the road so you can stop as much as you want and take in the wonderful views. We had a grea time walking on the snow at Logan Pass and we saw a marmot and mountain goats. All in all, an experience not to be missed. Another small tip, if you are travelling with a child and you are not the sole custodian, ensure you have a letter from your partner/spouse authorising you to travel with that child. We were asked for it at the Canadian border comng out of Glacier National Park, and also at immigration coming into Canada at Calgary airport. I don't understand why they need it when we never got asked for it coming into the USA, but they do, so have it available. Get it signed by someone authorised to witness documents too.There are a few places to eat in St Mary's just before you enter the park, none of them very good despite what we were told. Hope you enjoy the Going to the Sun Road. We certainly did.","July 20, 2008",Wow!,127,"Melbourne, Australia",5
Going-to-the-Sun Road,"I have had the priviledge of visiting to Glacier National Park 3 times. The beauty of Going-to-the-sun road which winds through the Park is just beyond words! There are absolutely no bad pictures to take, anywhere! I was fortunate enough to see 3 black bears and 3 grizzlies. That was so humbling. There is just something about this park that is the closest thing to heaven I have seen on earth. I know it is a National Park, but I would give anything to be able to live and work there. Being there is like stepping into a more pure time, where there are no wars, anger, hate and deception. Glacier National Park is unspoiled and wildly beautiful! You won't want to leave this beautiful place, it captures your heart! I would recommend visiting the park late in the season so you can have the park more to yourself.
