Mount Rainier,We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Mount Rainer. The weather cooperated and we had 2 out 3 clear days!! ,"October 15, 2019",Amazing!! ,77,"Dayton, Ohio",5
Mount Rainier,"While visiting Seattle, Washington we decided to visit Mt. Rainier National Park. Boy were we glad we did! Be prepared fill up a few memory cards for your cameras on this trip.Driving to the park takes the better part of the day so be sure to leave early. We entered the park and were greeted by one of the rangers there. While speaking with her, we found out that she was from Florida as were we. Talk about people getting around! The other thing you will find is that all of the rangers at the park are very knowledgeable at virtually every aspect of the park! If you have a chance, talk with them, they actually enjoy when you ask them questions! Once you enter the park you immediately feel like you are in a special place. The quietness of the forest, the cool breezes and the beautiful sights around each corner. Be sure to take your time and stop at all of the provided safe places to pull off the road. There are a lot, but you'll miss out on some beautiful pictures if you opt not to stop.We drove as far up the mountain as you can. There is a shop and a restaurant at the end of the road here, but be aware the prices are pretty high for the convenience provided. Stop and pick up lunch and snacks for the day before getting to the park if the thought of a $10 sandwich bothers you.Once you get the to highest you can by car, there are numerous trails available for the more adventurous visitors. Be prepared for a hike though! You only get about 1/3 the way up Mt. Rainier at this point and the rest of the way up is by good old foot power. When traveling to the northwest, be sure to bring your National Park Pass if you have one. If you don't have one consider getting one. We bought the lifetime pass a few years ago and it has more than paid for itself in the beautiful places you can see when using it! Mt. Rainier was one of the things on my bucket list and I'm definitely glad I went to see it. It was well worth the trip!","October 13, 2019",Words don't do it justice!,6,,5
Mount Rainier,"Mt. Rainier is a beautiful NP. Although, during our visit the weather obscured the view of Mt. Rainier. We were able to enjoy a good portion of the park that was visible.","October 10, 2019",Beautiful park,21,"Midlothian, Virginia",5
Mount Rainier,The view of Mount Rainier simply takes your breath away. There are various trails and hikes to do. I would recommend doing proper research before you get there. We didn't and regretted it! You may be lucky and see a Black bear like us :).,"October 10, 2019",Breathtaking,96,"Yateley, United Kingdom",5
Mount Rainier,"We had alway wanted to visit Mount Rainier NP and finally got to do so this fall. We stayed in Ashford rather than commute from Seattle. We were well past the famous wildflower season but a great time. We visited Paradise, Longmire and the Grove of the Patriarchs over 2 days. We did not make it to Sunrise. It was fairly clear the first day (we spent the whole day at Paradise) but rain poured down almost all day on our second day there.Here are some thoughts about visiting Rainier:1. Consider visiting in the off-season, even in the depth of winter; Longmire lodging is available and the road to Paradise is plowed.2. Stay in the park or nearby3. If driving in from further away plan to get in early, ideally by 8AM during the high season. 4. Have $30 in cash ready or pre-purchase a single-vehicle park pass online from Your Pass .com and print it. Only a paper ticket is accepted; an e-ticket on the phone cannot be scanned and you will have to fork over another $30 to get in.5. Be prepared to visit elsewhere in the park if Paradise is packed7. Be sure heck in with the rangers at the Paradise visitors’ center. Based on trail conditions, your preference and abilities they will suggest hikes to check out.6. Be prepared to hike steep grade slopes at Paradise, though all the trails starting from the Paradise parking lots are paved a good distance up the side of the mountain 7. Be aware you might be more easily tired or short of breath at the higher altitude especially given that you will be hiking, which may or may not be a problem depending on your experience, degree of fitness, conditioning, and medical health.8. Be prepared to be one of many visitors; there was rarely a sense of solitude on the lower portions of the trail.9. Be prepared for Mount Rainier to not show itself. 10. The weather is fickle and unpredictable.","October 10, 2019",Must-do when in the Seattle area,501,"Palos Heights, Illinois",5
Mount Rainier,"Signed up to visit Mt. Ranier. The Day was beautiful and we passed through Puyallap Wash. It is a 50-60 mile trip to get there. RON was our tour guide and he knows his stuff. Ron is knowledgeable on the mountain, the Glaciers, the rivers, The water falls, The plants, trees and Old world Forest. Well the weather up on Ranier was foggy and socked in. We could maybe see up 500 feet. The weather at Paradise was very cool & damp. Ron would explain How Ranier gets snow up on the Mountain all year long. More snow than anywhere else. The History of the mountain, the Snow, Glaciers and run off are for any outdoors man. Very good trip..! ( saw Ranier from Puget sound and that was special)","October 8, 2019",Tours Northwest used to Visit Ranier,19,"Fort Wayne, Indiana",5
Mount Rainier,"Mount Rainer is definitely worth the drive from Seattle. The mountain provides a majestic appearance and many excellent photographs. Yet, due to crowds at Mount Rainier I preferred hiking in the Tatoosh Mountains in Packwood, which are about 30 minutes away from Paradise, at the foot of the large trailheads for Mt. Rainier.","October 8, 2019",Glad I Went,1,Atlanta,5
Mount Rainier,"An absolutely stunning park.So much to do and see, lots of wildlife and lots of beautiful walks.One of our favourite national parks.","October 7, 2019",Stunning,29,,5
Mount Rainier,"We were picked up at a SeaTac airport hotel by our tour guide, Cheryl. The tour is done in an SUV with two couples maximum. No one else had scheduled for that day [a Wednesday] so my husband and I ended up with a private tour. Cheryl did a wonderful job of stopping at numerous photo opportunities and was very knowledgeable about Mount Rainier and the surrounding area. We picked up our lunch at a Seattle area grocery store before heading to Mount Rainier. Mother Nature cooperated greatly and we had a beautiful, clear day for the tour. There were numerous areas for hiking with various skill levels. My husband and I are in our 70s and Cheryl took us through areas that were fairly level and based on our low level of hiking skills. She was knowledgeable about various trees, plants, etc in the different areas along with many beautiful photo opportunities.","October 2, 2019",Mount Rainier ~ Cheryl's Northwest Tours,19,"Hillsboro, Oregon",5
Mount Rainier,Really nice place to visit. View is snow with snow all around. View points and falls at different location on the way are also must watch.,"October 1, 2019",Great place to visit,3,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",5
Mount Rainier,We went to Seattle to take the Amtrak Pacific Coast line to LA and we went to Mount Rainier for a day trip. It was a beautiful place and a lot to see along the road. We did not know where to go first so we picked Paradise center first and then the Sunrise side. Driving from one to another was beautiful but it took almost 2 hours. Both places have restroom facilities but the Paradise is much better. We should go to Sunrise first since the sun would hit the Mount Rainier and it would better for taking pictures. We went in September so the traffic was good except when we drove back to the hotel. Seattle and Tacoma traffic is terrible !!!,"September 29, 2019",A beautiful park,0,,5
Mount Rainier,"The park is beautiful, nice drive, but unfortunately it was cloudy on the day we visitied. However, there is more to the park than looking at the mountain (which i never saw). The waterfalls, flowers, wildlife - awesome. Worth a visit. I will return.","September 27, 2019",Awesome even on a cloudy day,43,,5
Mount Rainier,"Go early! We stayed just outside of the park, and got to the parking lot around 9 am. The lot was already half full. The weather was overcast, but by the time we hiked around it cleared up. Hard to believe how big the mountain is. We had a great lunch right at Paradise lodge. Great experience even for the novice hiker.","September 27, 2019",Breath taking views,24,"Maplewood, Minnesota",5
Mount Rainier,Spent 3 days in the park. Had the most incredible weather on Saturday so did a very pleasant hike up sunset rim. Saw three bears from a distance as well as a mountain goat. Very impressed with volunteer rangers who were always on hand to offer tips and advice.,"September 23, 2019",Amazing visit,2,"Cornwall, United Kingdom",5
Mount Rainier,"It's a beautiful road heading in if you like driving in the mountains. Unfortunately, the road and the mountain was fogged in. I was standing at the visitors center and literally did not see the mountain. I chose Mt. Rainier over Yellowstone and drove far out of my way to see it, so I'm still a little salty. Aside from Mother Nature giving me the finger, the visitor center didn't open until something silly, like 10 a.m. These places need to open at 8 a.m. at the latest.","September 23, 2019",Mother Nature can be a beast,12,"Auburn, Maine",4
Mount Rainier,"The Scenic road from Paradise which passes by Stephens canyon to Intersection with 123 is very treacherous in spots. There are many sharp,steep drop offs with absolutely NO guard rails of any kind. In many cases there is not even a shoulder, literally no more than 6 inches. If you encounter an oncoming vehicle crossing the center line, in one of these areas, which is not uncommon on a scenic road, you are in critical danger. There is absolutely no room to swerve without going off the road, which means down the cliff. We went up to paradise from 123, but chose NOT to return, instead leaving the park via Longmire.","September 22, 2019",Scenic road from Paradise to Intersection with 123 is very treacherous in spots,3,,2
Mount Rainier,"The day was a bit cloudy and rain in the late afternoon, but it didn’t stop us. Thankfully we stoped and hiked Carter Falls. Not only is there a nice waterfall at the end (moderate hike with steps and incline) you get a very nice view of the mountain from the riverbed. I am glad we stopped because this was the only time we could actually see the mountain. Paradise has tons of really good trails to keep you busy. Be aware the parking lot is not huge and only 2 hour parking. Get there early for a spot. ","September 17, 2019",She is beautiful!!!,82,"Carbondale, Illinois",5
Mount Rainier,"Our only day to see Mount Rainier with some guests from Germany fell on Labor Day in 2019. Should we go or not? What would the traffic be like? I gleaned some good tips from TripAdvisor reviews, and then took the plunge...It worked out very well! It fell out as follows:1. We started out in Seattle at 10:30am. The traffic all the way to Enumclaw (highways I-90, 405, 169) were fine - very little delay. I worried about highway 410 to the mountain, but traffic moved along there too.2. We skipped the Federal Forest and Crystal Mountain, but those would have been worthy stops. You'd run out of time for some of our later stops, however.3. We reached the turn off to Sunrise - no bad traffic to this point - and gave it a try. Pretty soon we hit a long line. A park ranger was telling people at the end of the line that it would be an hour and a half wait to reach the ticket booth. He gave us one additional crucial tip: on Labor Day and all busy summer weekends, the parking lots at Sunrise and Paradise start to free up after 2pm. So we turned around and didn't wait in this line.4. Our first stop was Tipsoo Lake. This came from a TripAdvisor tip. We got the last spot in the parking lot, but there is more parking up the road. We walked around the lake - it gives a fine view of the mountain. We headed up the Naches trail, wondering if that would lead to a viewpoint. The main trail does not - it leads back to the road and more parking. We turned left on an unmaintained but distinguishable trail and this did eventually lead to a sheltered valley with a great view of the mountain.5. Next stop: The Grove of the Patriarchs for the big trees. Again, the parking lot was full, but we stopped a little further on at the side of the road.6. By now it was about 3pm, so we went on ahead to Reflection Lakes (quick stop) and Paradise. There was plenty of parking at Paradise by this time.7. Going home we backtracked the way we had come and arrived back at Sunrise just after 7pm. All of the facilities closed promptly at 7pm, but we enjoyed the view of the mountain with the clouds lit up by the setting sun.8. Again, returning home through Enumclaw we encountered no bad traffic.The weather was good all day. Our luck with the traffic did not have to do with bad weather. If that ranger is right, this itinerary can be enjoyed throughout the summer.If you wanted to add the chair lift at Crystal, leave earlier from Seattle.Good luck!","September 11, 2019",How To: Day Trip on Labor Day to Mount Rainier,71,"Bellevue, WA",5
Mount Rainier,"The was probably my favorite mountain we visited while vacationing in the area. Words can’t do Mount Rainier justice. We did the Skyline trail and it was beyond words. Mount Rainier was visible at the start of the hike, but it was soon covered with fog and clouds, but to us it only added to the mystery. I can’t recommend this place enough. Get there early because it got very crowded when we were there.","September 11, 2019",Majestic!,270,"Tyler, Texas",5

Mount Rainier,"I know I’m probably biased because I live in Washington. However, I prefer Ranier to Yellowstone or Yosemite! The other parks are so crowded during peak season. Ranier has all the majesty without as many idiots! You do want to arrive early on the Sunrise side during peak season, especially with f it’s clear, because they do close the road when the parking gets full. If you enjoy hiking and the outdoors- it’s an absolutely wonderful place to visit. ","September 8, 2019",Spectacular! ,8,,5
Mount Rainier,"Mount Rainier national Park is a treasure. There are endless possibilities for hiking, camping and enjoying this natural wonder roughly two hours south of Seattle. If you are lucky to come here on a clear day, I recommend going up to Paradise Inn and walking one of the easy trails that lead through the gorgeous meadows up the side of the mountain. You will be rewarded with spectacular views and a renewed sense of awe. ","September 5, 2019",Visit Seattle’s Friendly Neighborhood Volcano!,101,"Bothell, Washington",5
Mount Rainier,Absolutely stunning landscapes all around you carved by the volcano that is the Mount Rainier. The 14K feet behemoth stands tall with glaciers melting to create waterfalls and streams. Mindblowing view all around you.Trails are very well maintained around the Paradise and the Sunrise area. Eastern side is the drier side so you have better chances of seeing the mountain towards the sunrise side while the Paradise side can get you dramatic cloud and mountain scenes galore. All this and only 2-3 hours away from Seattle.,"September 3, 2019",Built around the massive Mount Rainier,18,bangalore,5

Mount Rainier,"Honestly, I had no idea that Mount Rainier would offer so much beauty. My review is from the view of a SeniorCitizen, so I was pleasantly surprised that a good majority of waterfalls and hiking paths were easily accessible. In two days time I was able to see so much nature and more to be discovered. The Park Rangers were very helpful with directions and supplied us with a map at the entrance stations. The first day it was cloudy and in the evening it cleared up, so we had a clear view of the mountain from many view points. The sky was clear and we could see the Milky Way, which was a great treat for those who love astronomy. No complaints, beautiful country and looking forward to return for discovering more waterfalls and hikes.","September 3, 2019",Mount Rainier A MUST for Those That Love Nature,1,"Los Angeles, California",5

Mount Rainier,"Mt Rainier is my favorite thing about WA State. It’s the highlight of every visit to the Pacific NorthWest. If you have not been to the park it’s way worth Your time, money, & effort. Both the paradise and sunrise sides are beautiful as have a lot to see. I love the water falls and riverbed on the paradise side. Many trails and things to see in the park. Your could spend a week here and probably not see it all. ","August 28, 2019",A must do while in WA State! ,40,"Springfield, Ohio",5
Mount Rainier,"We visited Mt Rainier National Park in July 2019 and had an amazing experience. The park is truly stunning and we were really lucky to have excellent weather during the three days we stayed there. We were able to see the Mt Rainier on all the three days and in addition to the mountain - the hiking and the wildflowers added to the positive experienceThere are multiple areas of the park that need to be covered and so a little planning will go a long way. I recommend at least 2-3 day trip to experience the key areas such as Paradise, Sunrise, Tipsoo Lake etc. If you are visiting the pacific northwest and if you love nature/national parks, I strongly recommend that you include Mt Rainier National Park into your planning!","August 25, 2019",Truly Outstanding Park!

It’s a big parking lot that fills up quickly, but we managed to score a space easily for our 27ft RV.Grab a trail map and go! We did the Skyline Trail, which was awesome.Half of us did the full trail, and the other half opted to come down via the GoldenGateTrail.....both offer views that leave you speechless andhumbled.As previously mentioned, we had great weather....it was not onlysunny & warm, but the wildflowers were in full bloom....just stunning and absolutely breathtaking. We even threw a few snowballs (in August!!!) from the leftover snow along the trail.

Only problem was the parking shortage. Would definitely recommend arriving early to get parking, especially on the weekend. After the paradise trail, we visited Sunrise on the other side of the park and hiked several miles. It was beautiful, but we encountered two bears on the trail on the way back.

There is lots of parking, although it gets full quickly, a restaurant and hotel.Lots of walking paths and hikes in the area. Some of the walks are paved, so they are easy to access. Beautiful wildflowers that time of year and we spotted a few animals too. The road going up to Paradise has a few stops with nice views and photo opportunities.

The park is located less than two hours from Seattle and I highly recommend the trip for anyone visiting the area. The views of the mountain are stunning. There are several lookout points throughout the park, and you can also visit sunrise or paradise if you want to drive deeper into the park. There is also a view from the gondola ride at crystal mountain, which is what we chose to do. I recommend to check the weather before arriving, you need a clear day to view the mountain. We used the webcams at the crystal mountain website to plan our trip, because we could tell their were clouds blocking the view in the morning.

If you have the flexibility to change visits, pick a clear day to go to Mount Rainier National Park. We went to the visitor center & had lunch (not more than cafeteria food). We viewed the movie, and exhibits, & gift shop. The only thing that tempered our visit was the rainy, cloudy weather. Be prepared to bring a heavy jacket as the temp at the visitor center was 20 degrees lower than the bottom of the mountain.

The clouds were kind of high on the days we were there (and around the area), they did part enough (later in the day) for us to get a peek at the top.

Mount Rainier,"This was such a beautiful place to visit. I had a hard time capturing the depth of the views with my phone but they were excellent. Originally my boyfriend and I went to the Paradise visitors center and attempted to hike a trail there, but we were unprepared for the amount of snow (we are from Pennsylvania so we didn’t realize how much snow there would be so late in the year at such an altitude!) and we didn’t want to rent snow shoes—however they were available and there was an instructor to help you with them. We ended up turning back and going to the Longmire visitors center and hiking the waterfall trail there which was absolutely beautiful and had much less snow for us! The drive up the mountain alone offers wonderful views and is well worth the $30 admission price for a vehicle. Mt. Rainier is definitely a place for nature lovers and I really hope I have a chance to come back and see more of it someday!","May 31, 2019",Beautiful Place to Visit,8,"Lancaster, Pennsylvania",5

What a great adventure, we hiked to several waterfalls and wow what a magical place. We drove up to the visitors center where the mountain climbers meet up before heading further up the mountain. Plenty of snow on the ground up at the visitors center. We ate lunch at the visitors center and the food was pretty good and quite reasonable. Lots of places to take in the views and hike around. I'm guessing the weather detoured many people from heading up but I recommend the trip even if the weather is less than perfect.

Mount Rainier,"I live in the mountains, but the sheer size and beauty of Mount Rainier is jaw dropping! We didn't give ourselves enough time to fully explore the park because this was actually a side trip. The best views of the mountain are from the Sunrise visitor center or going over to the Crystal Mountain ski resort and taking the gondola to the top. We initially entered the park from the Stevens Canyon entrance and stopped at the Ohanapecosh Campground. You don't pay to get into the park to get to the campground, but you have to pay to be parked there for more than 30 minutes. Once you pay for parking, this will cover the cost of the park entrance fee if you go up to the Sunrise visitor center. There is a Silver Falls loop trail that is a 2.7 mile hike from the Ohanapecosh campground. Most people start at the southeast trailhead where the river will be on your left. We left from the southwest trailhead and had a peaceful hike without seeing many people. This route will bring you to the falls higher up than the other trail that leads you to observation decks. We explored up river to see more of the falls. The river in July still had plenty of power so the spray from the waterfall was refreshing after the hike. My daughter was not happy to be hiking because she was tired, but once we reached the falls, she was excited and happy I made her go. The water is that minty turquoise color as is typical in the Pacific Northwest and western Canada. So pretty!","April 14, 2019",Amazing!,10,"McCall, Idaho",5

A relatively short drive (about two hours) from Seattle or Tacoma is nothing to sacrifice for the splendor of the views, serenity, and beauty of the park.There are so many different hiking trails at all levels of ability that there is something for everyone. It can get crowded on weekends and high-season that may make finding parking at many trailheads difficult, but the park is massive and there are so many places to visit that being patient and finding another location is worth it without being disappointed.Both the Visitors' Center and Paradise Inn were closed for the season (the Inn for renovations and the Visitor Center is only open on weekends) during our visit last week, but the weather cooperated completely.Best times to visit for optimal scenery and hiking without fewer crowds is dawn/dusk; while the midday is great for warmer temperatures and relaxing.

You may even be fortunate enough to see some deer! At times, there will be cloud cover, other times sun, it's unpredictable, as should be your stops. There are plenty of easy hiking trails, e.g. Trail of the Shadows, as well as those for the more hearty.On the east side, the road to Sunrise is worth a look, but it's not open all year round, so check first before you go.

We had to turn around at the entrance because after Nov 1, all folks are required to have tire chains available in their vehicle. We drove 3 or so miles back to Whittaker's outdoor supply shop to rent the chains (for $15) for the day. We headed back to the park, and because of the time of the year, only the road to Paradise Park was open - and actually, there was snow up at Paradise Park (maybe and inch or 2, but enough to cover the trees and ground, although the road was plowed and just wet at the time.) There was plenty for us to see and do, and plenty of trails to hike. It rained and drizzled on and off, but with waterproof boots, raincoats, hats, and gloves, we were ok.

We only had half the day to enjoy the sights around the mountain and wished we could have spent a whole day there, if you can start early in the morning it is definitely a worthy thing to do so you can really soak up the sights as you go around the mountain. Because we only had the afternoon to visit we kind of rushed from one spot to another and really didn't get to soak up the whole experience... but it was worth the rush to get to the upper park area and walk the paths up towards the mountain. Be prepared with a jacket/hat (when it's windy it can feel cold) Such a beautiful sight. The landscape is amazing. Just be careful driving the crazy curvey roads. If you're afraid of heights this is NOT for you. The most of the roadway is winding and without guardrails. ENJOY! and if you're a photographer this is one of the best sights to take in.

Took home rocks washed down from the glaciers, hugged huge trees. We then drove to Paradise Park where we hiked the trails through meadows, saw up close marmots and chipmunks. The view at the top was spectacular surrounded by mountains and a waterfall. I would highly recommend a visit here.","October 8, 2018",The Magic of Mt. Rainier,7,"Spartanburg, South Carolina",5

Mount Rainier,The ride may seem long from I-5 but the drive to Mt Rainier is worth every moment. We recently visited as we headed south out of Seattle and were wowed by the natural beauty evident in every area of the park. Since it is a National Park the Senior pass is welcome which means you can skip the $30 entrance fee. It wasn’t crowded as the summer crowds are gone and the trees have begun to change color. We spent about four hours in the park stopping to take in the beauty and take pictures. Food was available but limited; bring your own with you for lunch. There are numerous picnic tables and rest areas.,"October 2, 2018",Too magnificent to miss,53,"Irvington, New Jersey",5
Mount Rainier,"I first visited this spectacular mountain many years ago. It felt like coming home to see it again. It is 65-miles SE of Seattle. It’s 14’er, at 14,410 feet, and the tallest in the Cascade Range. It has the most glaciers of any mountain in the US, more than 25, and yet steam still escapes from its top. Named ‘Tahoma’ by the Northwest Indians, it was named ‘Rainier’ after a British Rear Admiral. The area was made a National Park in March 1899.Today, we found it improved as far as facilities go, and just as enjoyable as it was long ago.Parking is plentiful and free at the Jackson Visitor Center, where you will find clean restrooms, helpful rangers, and a nice café offering sandwiches and pizza slices.As we enjoyed walking some short distances and driving some others, the mountain gradually came out from behind the summit clouds. It is simply without words to see it. As the Park Service says, I think I found My Park!' PS to the National Park Service: This visit was made possible by the National Park Pass. Thank you.","October 2, 2018",I Found My Park!,532,"Phoenix, Arizona",5

Mount Rainier,"Great Hike, starts up with a paved path for the trail, then it turns into dirt and rocks, then by Pebble Creek the patch of snow begins. From here onwards it's going to be trekking in snow only till you reach Camp Muir. One important point to this hike is : make sure its sunny as it is a beautiful and harsh uphill hike, bring a windbreaker, toque, gloves and a board or a short sled for sliding back down the mountain. Views are breathtaking, Mount St. Helen's, mountain goats, other mountains below you.","October 2, 2018",Camp Muir Hike,2,"Calgary, Canada",5

Mount Rainier,"I took my two granddaughters both are eight (8). I looked up the price and went any way, thinking they must have a one day pass. They didn't. $30 dollars to get in for maybe an hour in the park is ridiculous! If you're going to be there the full seven (7) days then fine. But with an autistic child who already was done after the 1/2 hour wait just to get to the entrance, I knew she'd be ready to go after maybe an hour. So we turned around and stopped in Elbe and had a picnic there and saw the trains. $30 ridiculous. When my other granddaughter and I came up from Texas we saw Shoshone Falls for free and it was beautiful. Next time I'll take her to Leavenworth. We can shop.","September 30, 2018",Too expensive!,0,,1
Mount Rainier,"We rented a car in down town Seattle and drove out to Mount Rainer National Park. It was easy to get to and we made many stops along the way. The park is just breathtaking with rivers and waterfalls and snow topped Mount Rainer. Half way up the mountain you can stop at Paradise and grab a bite to eat, go hiking, pick up some souvenirs. We saw deer walking along the pathway that we were on they were so beautiful. the colors were coming out on the mountain and it made the views even more breathtaking. If you are visiting Seattle try to get out to see this spectacular national park.","September 30, 2018",Absolutely breathtaking !,24,"Spring Hill, Florida",5

It was the best scenery I have ever worked in front of.","September 27, 2018",Heaven on earth,19,"Austin, Texas",5
Mount Rainier,"Mountain weather changes rapidly. If you are lucky enough to have clear skies, they might not last beyond 1pm. Go early. Bring layers. My visit was in September with temps in the low 40's but it warmed into the 50's. With hiking, I was warm in a t-shirt. The paths near the visitor center are paved and wide. If you don't plan to hike, just bring tennis-shoes. Look at the map for the levels of difficulty. If you want to get closer to the glacier at higher altitudes, the trails are less maintained and you will need hiking boots. Don't forget extra water and snacks (and sunscreen). You will be going uphill and will need energy and hydration. Feeding wildlife is not a good idea. The squirrels and chipmunks are used to people and they will jump on you. It might sound cute, but it's not. It will cost $30 per car to get in. Passes are available, but seem most cost-effective for seniors. Look up the entrances on google before you go. Some entrances close at different times of the year as the weather changes. The northwest entrance is closed to vehicles at all times. Fill up your gas tank before you get into the park, and be prepared for no cell service, which could mean no maps. The closest entrance from downtown Seattle is just over 100 miles. This is a must-see!","September 25, 2018",Go early in the day. This is a must-see!,31,"San Diego, California",5
Mount Rainier,Visited mount rainier in September. We drive up the mountain and stopped at each sight got out and walked. There were plenty of places to pull over to take pictures. I highly recommend Narada falls and paradise. At paradise there were restrooms and a little restaurant to get hot chocolate and few food choices. From paradise you could go by foot and hike up even more. I will say it was a steep hike! Highly recommend!,"September 25, 2018",Fun ,25,"Annapolis, Maryland",5

Mount Rainier,"At 14,410 feet, it is a crown jewel in The Cascades along the Pacific Northwest thereby earning it the right to have its own National Park. While the mountain’s well known peak is visible for miles in every direction, it’s alpine, glacier clad slopes occupy only one third of the park. This is the fifth oldest National Park in the nation. The park has multiple entrances but the Paradise Entrance is the most popular. There are five major entrances: Longmire (southwest), Paradise (south), Ohanapecosh (southeast), Sunrise / White River (northeast), Carbon River / Mowich Lake (northwest). No matter which entrance you choose to enter from, a view of Mt. Rainier is possible either after a hike or a drive. Weather is the king here, and if it is cloudy, you will not be able to see the peak at all because it rises above the clouds. Go prepared with layers of clothing as required because at higher altitudes it gets chilly. ","September 24, 2018",Crown Jewel of The Cascades,38,"Detroit, Michigan",5

Mount Rainier,"We were visiting Seattle for the first time but it wasn't the city that was the biggest attraction for us, it was Mount Rainier. We rented a car and entered the park from the southwest gate on highway 706. The weather was foggy and there was snow on the ground, and this was in the month of May!We made our way to the Henry M Jackson visitor center and went inside to eat and shop. By then the sun had come out but we still couldn't see the peak of Mount Rainier. We started climbing up from the north side of the parking lot to see what the view would be like. The snow is still deep enough in May that snow shoes (available for rent in the visitor center) are advisable. We didn't rent snow shoes so we got wet feet but we had a great time! We hiked up to where groups were being trained by guides to learn how to ascend the mountain. The view was outstanding!Plan ahead enough to bring warm clothes and dry shoes and socks.","September 17, 2018",So inviting to start climbing,34,"Kenosha, Wisconsin",5

Mount Rainier,"We visited on Friday, July 27th. We left our hotel at Sea Tac at 5:10 so we would have a jump on the traffic. We went through Enumclaw and were at Sunrise pretty early in the morning, not a lot of other people there. The visitor center wasn't open, but the ranger station was and she gave me a detailed map of Mt. Rainier and said it would be about an hour and a half drive to Paradise. At Sunrise - you have to go back the same way you came then turn to be on the road to Paradise. We stopped a few places for photos - then we entered through the Stevens Canyon entrance and walked the Grove of the Patriarch trail, unfortunately we thought the end was at the bridge, but we found out it went a little further after we returned. Next stop was right around Lake Louise - a beautiful spot for photos at a little waterfall right before that and then the photo of the Lake is one of my favorites. Not too far from there and we were at Reflection Lake - I was so excited at this point. We got out and walked for a few mintues and took some great photos. Before we knew it we were at the Paradise entrance. Luckily here it becomes a one way road and makes a loop. The parking area was full so we had to park a little ways down the road and walk back up, but it wasn't bad. We grabbed a snack (chips,frozen yogurt) and ate outside - if you want to eat at the visitor center be prepared it is very expensive - sloppy joe for $10. We spent some time here for a while - there is a small gift shop upstairs - grabbed a t shirt, magnet, and knife for my son and we were on the way. By this time, there were cars parked way down the hill. We weren't too far from Longmire, we did stop there but only long enough for my husband to find out how far we were from a gas station. Looked like an interesting stop - this is where the National Park Inn is located. As we were leaving through Nisqually - there wasn't a line going in at that point. It was around 2:00. I didn't really think that we would be able to drive the loop and I am so glad that we did. Suggestions - if you see something interesting, stop and enjoy because you will want to be there once you are back home. There are several overlooks/pull offs - take the time to see what is there. If you are inclined to hike some trails then do so - we aren't big hikers but did want to see the mountain and are happy with what we got to see. Make sure that you have a FULL tank of gas - we were at 3/4 and were getting nervous before we got out of the park - there are NO gas stations in the park. Ashford is the closest one when you get out of the park and the ONLY one for a while. Take snacks and some drinks. Do the loop it is fabulous. Don't worry too much about the wildflowers, there weren't as many as I expected, maybe we were a week or 2 early. And lastly - leave early and enjoy the day!","September 3, 2018",Absolutely stunning - go early!,110,"murfreesboro, tn",5
Mount Rainier,"This review will be for the park in general as there is only so much you can say about a mountain, even if it is an awesome one. There's lots to do here, from scenic lookouts, waterfalls to rest by, hikes of all ability levels, a large visitor center and more. One of the highlights for me was the grove of the patriarchs which was a collected area of extremely old, large trees. The drive through the park was peaceful and had great views around every turn. Be on the look out for animals as I spotted a few marmots on the side of the road while driving, and was even able to pull over for pictures, they seem to be somewhat used to people coming by.","August 31, 2018",Pacific Northwest,239,"New York City, New York",5

Mount Rainier,IT WAS AWFUL GETTING INTO THE PARK!!! REALLY!!! we had to wait in traffic almost 2 hours when we headed to the park Sunday June 24th at 11:00 AM. There were only 2 rangers checking people in- no provision for people who had passes and did not need to pay. A message to EVERYONE traveling to a NATIONAL PARK- TAKE CASH FOR THE ENTRANCE FEE- it takes so much time to process people paying with cards. UGH... that being said...To be standing in front of one of the most dangerous volcano's in the world is pretty awesome- went to the visitors center - read everything- watched movies- We stayed at the National Park Inn- When I made reservations we didn't know if the hotel at Paradise would be open so we took the hotel closer to the entrance. If we were staying in the park a little later in the season we would have definitely stayed at the Paradise Inn- we did get to the top and we went into the lodge for breakfast- great buffet and beautiful lodgeSo close to the mountain with beautiful views...,"August 28, 2018",ABSOLUTELY awesome to stand in front of this huge mountain...,54,Barrington NH,5
Mount Rainier,"We took the family up to Mt. Rainier for a day trip. Park entrance fee was $30 for the week. We drove up to Paradise, had a nice picnic lunch, the weather was awesome but there was smoke from forest fires from miles away, so the view was semi-obstructed. I guess it's all about timing. We hit the gift shop in the hotel and the nearby trails. We'll definitely go back again later. I'd suggest checking out a few of the waterfalls.","August 28, 2018",Beautiful park,39,,4
Mount Rainier,"Even with the haze and smoke from the wild land fires this was a terrific day. It's about 2 hours from Seattle and worth investing a whole day.

I can't imagine how beautiful this is in mid-winter.","August 27, 2018",Worth a trip from anywhere,17,"College Station, Texas",5
Mount Rainier,"First of all, it's a long drive to Mt. Rainier. And it can be cold up there on the mountain. So take some layers to wear and for god sakes bring the proper footwear! We got a late start and missed out on lunch at the Paradise Inn. It was too early for dinner. We had started out heading for Sunrise, decided to turn around and go for Paradise. There's a huge visitor center there and the Inn is there as well. Lots of folks milling around. On the way there, you can stop and take pics of the mountain as it gets larger and larger in the frame. The woods are thick with gigantic trees that are much older and wiser than you are, their grandeur is pretty awe-inspiring. But that pales in comparison to the majesty of the mountain. We got to Paradise, did a quick jaunt to the visitors center and then a ""short"" hike up to the waterfall. You can go on and on from there but it was already getting late so we came back down and bid adieu to the mountain. Our only regret is that we didn't have enough time there. We'll be back!

I spoke my mind at a family who had a baby that was crying constantly and I told them about altitude and its effects on young infants... anyway... the views here were amazing... the clean air ... the grasses and wildflowers were incredible... summer is clearly your best time... my other word of advice would be to talk puri-tabs or water steriliser tabs so you can sample some of the glacial water safely... do Skyline as a minimum and Muir if you are up to it...","August 22, 2018","Wow, Simply Wow, Simply Amazing",76,"Melbourne, Australia",5
Mount Rainier,This area is very badly affected by rancid smoke. The guy in the garage on WA12 said if we could see the mountain from the viewpoint we would have great views from the top. Got to the viewpoint and could just about see a silhouette of Mt Ranier through the smoke. We decided it was not worth paying $30 to drive to the top. I would seriously think whether to come here until the smoke clears. Must be a real health hazard at the moment ,"August 22, 2018",Never got there ,171,"Wakefield, United Kingdom",2

Mount Rainier,"During a stay in Seattle, we rented a car for the day to make a day trip to Mt. Rainier. It was about a 90-minute drive to the Nisqually park entrance. The drive to the park was scenic, but once inside the park, the scenery was simply incredible. We stopped first at the Longmire area, with a collection of historic buildings, an inn, restrooms, and a beautiful view of Mt. Rainier. We continued our drive up to Paradise, and pulled over for a few stops along the way to take in some roadside waterfalls and scenic views. We arrived at Paradise around 11am (on a Tuesday), and it was packed. If your schedule permits, try to arrive earlier or you could end up parking 1/2 mile away. The views from Paradise look like you’ve stepped into a painting - simply indescribable. There is a historic inn with a small cafe, and across the parking lot is the visitor center with a cafe. Both offer a good selection of foods, snacks, and drinks. There are several hiking options here, depending on your time and level of adventure. We didn’t have much time, so we did a short easy hike to Myrtle Falls, which took about 30 minutes round trip and made for some amazing views and photos. To really see all the park has to offer, you probably need 2-3 days, and staying inside the park is ideal. But if you’re staying in the Seattle area and are looking for a really enjoyable day trip, this is well worth the drive. ","August 19, 2018",Stunning scenery. ,277,"Wellington, Florida",5

Beautiful area and views and trails are great for hiking. Some are paved so you can explore easily or choose hiking trails into the woods. Views were not great when we were there from a distance due to wildfire smoke but once up close it was beautiful. We entered the park through the Nisqually entrance and chose to drive to the the Henry Jackson Visitor Center where we hiked for about 2 hours. A day pass for a vehicle is $30. Not nearly enough time before we had to head back to the airport. We went on a Wednesday morning and arrived to the park before 9 a.m., it was getting very busy as we were leaving around 1 p.m. so I recommend a weekday, and getting there early to allow more time to explore, the parking lot at the visitor center filled up quickly.

We got there around 8:30am and there was no line. There were a number of very good sights as we drove along the road toward the Paradise area. We didn't get to Paradise until around 11:30, and the parking was already full. We parked down the road about a quarter of a mile. It wasn't that bad - and we were thankful that we saw everything along the way. There are some amazing waterfalls and sights that are well worth going in the Stevens Canyon entrance. After several hours at Paradise (which was very crowded by the way), which included catching a Ranger Talk inside the lobby of the Paradise Inn (which I would highly recommend) we drove back down the West side of the mountain back to Olympia. I have to say that there wasn't as much to see along the West side in my view. I would definitely recommend checking out the Stevens Canyon side of the mountain. It was a great day.

Mount Rainier,"I did not go to Mount Rainier to have a pleasant hike, or smell the flowers, etc. I went with a group to summit that 14,410 ft, glacier and crevasse covered monster. We were successful, but this is no easy thing. People can die on this mountain at elevation. You have major exposure (to falls) when summiting. You have to train with a heavy ruck going up and down slopes for many months before attempting this summit, and you have to have mountaineering gear: boots, ice ax, ropes, harness, etc. Summiting this dangerous mountain is NOT for the casual recreationist. This is for physically fit, those with muscular strength and cardiovascular endurance, those who are trained in and committed to mountaineering. If someone claims they summitted this mountain on a day hike they are not telling the truth.","August 6, 2018","Not the highest or most technical climb, but no walk in teh park.",50,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",5

You can drive or hike up the mountainside, keeping in mind that there are no guard railings on the roads, though the roads are very maintained, there are drops of thousands of feet-- So drive carefully! The water and air are pristine. We visited Mount Rainier National Park in July and there was still a lot of snow, so dress warm for the top of the mountain! There is an entrance fee of $30 per car, there is also camping if you're interested. There were many people hiking.

Mount Rainier,"This mountain can be seen from far away, but it will take time to get there. We went twice in July: on the 5th and 22nd, and arrive at the entrance around noon. There was a long queue, it took the first time 30 minutes, the second time even 1 hour just to enter the park. This does not mean you are there yet. Count on an extra 40 minutes, without stops (and it is tempting to stop to enjoy the views) to reach the parking lot at Paradise Inn where several trails start. This parking was twice very full, some cars were parked at the road side.We wanted to do the skyline trail, but had to return on the first day, as there was still too much snow on the trail. The part we could walk on, was great. The first part is very steep, some people tried to do it with strollers (not a good idea...). We were so impressed that we decided to return a few weeks later, and for sure did not regret it: you can walk till the panorama point, but the trail still continues to a higher point which offers in my opinion even more spectacular views. You can see different mountains (like Mount St. Helens). It also impressive to see how the flowers grow in this hostile environment (most areas are 9 months covered with snow). We did this hike on a sunny day, not a detail in the mountains. The hike took several hours (is about 10KM long), and does require good shoes. Don't forget to bring sufficient water, and make sure you use sun protection (there still is a lot of snow around, which not only reflects the sunlight, but also reduces the temperature a bit so you might not notice your skin is burned by the sun).How about safety? As always, you are in the mountains, some common sense is the minimum needed. There are a few areas where more attention is required, you may still need to cross some sections covered by snow (yes, also in summer time!!), other areas are covered with unstable stones,..., some areas are rather steep (people afraid of heights might feel very uncomfortable on some sections).In general: when you want to visit this park, first check the weather conditions and the amount of snow in the area to avoid any disappointments.One last remark: please do respect the signs and stay on the trail. I simply cannot understand why people travel from all over the globe to this place to see the incredible beautiful nature, to ignore the signs and destroy it by taking shortcuts...","July 28, 2018","Very impressive scenery, but be aware about travel time and snow, even in July",63,"Leuven, Belgium",5

We were able to experience amazing views and some waterfalls. My tip would be to bring bug spray, sunscreen, a hat, water, and good walking/hiking shoes. Their were swarms of mosquitos on some of the hikes we took. I wasn't prepared for that. Be prepared to spend the whole day there. The park is vast.

The weather was perfect. I would caution you about the crazy amts of biting flies, bees and mosquitos there are. We were ill-equipped to ward them off and got bitten several times!The views along the way were spectacular! Initially, we didn't intend to hike this strenuous trail, but the futher we went, the more beautiful the views, so we continued on.We saw lots of animals, marmots, chipmunks, mountain goat, and also hiked through snow-covered mountains and streams, which was fun!Highly recommend!","July 25, 2018",A must see!,21,,5

This point is on the skyline trail and is a part of a bigger loop back to Paradise.Since there was a lot of snow on the trails past panorama point, rangers asked us to do an out-and-back to the Panorama point.The trail starts off steep but the slope becomes gradual as it progresses - but by then you'd have gotten used to the steepness. It gains 1700 ft in ~ 1.7 miles. Thankfully the weather was clear and we could see beautiful wildflowers, chipmunks, marmots and a waterfall along the trail. This particular trail was snow-free for the first half, but we had to cross three large snowfields to reach our destination. Make sure you have boots that can help you walk on snow.It's a beautiful mountain, and views get even better as you climb!

Mount Rainier,"My 2 kids, mom and I visited the park 7/11 & 7/12, as we stayed in a cabin near the entrance of the National Park. We arrived at the entrance about 8:00 AM, and there were only 4-5 cars in front of us. The line moved quickly. This is a stunning drive through woods and winding roads. Gorgeous waterfalls, streams and rivers all along the way to the Visitor Center in Paradise. We stopped at the Visitors Center which was extremely crowded and parking was hard to find - the first parking lot you come to is overflow parking, the visitor center is at the main parking lot a little further up. We simply sat on a parking row and waited a few minutes for someone to leave. Patience is a virtue here! :) We noticed upon driving out that this is a one-way road, so if you miss the 2nd lot, you may be forced to park on the side of the road WAAAAYYY down and hike back up the road to the visitor center. ANYWAY, it was a gorgeous day, and we stopped at the info desk inside and asked for info on each of the trails. We opted for the ""easy"" trail, which was the Skyline Trail. We walked to Myrtle Falls, and then a little further until the snow covered the path. Had we all been in better shape, I could have walked for hours. Unfortunately, the inclines and altitude got to us Texans. :( We decided to grab lunch in the cafe and eat outside at one of the many picnic tables. The cafe is a little pricey, but had a good selection. It was getting very crowded by now, so we decided to head out and continue driving. We drove to Reflection Lake and a few miles further to Stevens Canyon road. Take Stevens Canyon Road a bit if you want breathtaking views of the canyon. The kids were squealing in the back seat all the way about the winding road and how high up we were. :) We eventually turned around and headed back to our cabin, but I definitely recommend this drive into the park and stopping to see the many waterfalls along the way, as well as a stop at the Visitor Center.

We have heard it is not uncommon to be ""fogged in"" however we had blue sky in every direction (Grateful!). We were here in early July so there were not as many wildflowers and still lots of snow, however the views are spectacular. We highly recommend the Paradise area for hiking and relaxing.

I would highly suggest having a plan for where you want to go as the distances between the entrances are quite significant and we didn’t want to backtrack and have a longer drive home. Google the map before getting there as there is no phone service once you get to the forest.The forest is wonderful and the views of the mountain from so many angles is fantastic!

We drove onto the Paradise area and got there around 1:30. We were able to drive the Paradise Loop which was gorgeous. However, we were unable to go into the Visitor Center or the Lodge because there was no parking available. That was a little disappointing.

Mount Rainier,"This was my first opportunity to spend some quality time in Washington, so we decided to take a day trip to Mt. Rainier.Expect about a 20-30 minute wait to get into the park. Entrances fee is $30, and is good for 7 days. I purchased an annual pass for my friend and her daughter to come back, which was only $55.The views are absolutely breathtaking and there are many overlook spots where you can pull over along your drive and take pictures. We made quite a few stops along the way to take everything in....the falls, box canyon, etc. We decided to drive to the furthest point: Sunrise, which ended up being about a 2 hour drive once we got in the park. There are many different trail options and you are informed of the level of difficulty.Once we arrived at Sunrise, we checked out the information at the Visitor’s Center. The rangers there were very helpful. We also grabbed something to eat at the snack bar. The menu is not super extensive and it is kind of pricey. They have burgers, hot dogs, soups, and cold sandwiches and other snacks. Avg cost of the burger was around $9. I was pleased that they had vegetarian options, so that was a plus.Afterwards we walked to Silver Forest trail which was only 3 miles round trip.

Mount Rainier,Spent today at Mount Rainier National Park. We Arrived at Paradise Area Lodge at around 9:30 am. There was plenty of parking available in the overflow lot. The visitor center opened at 10 a.m. The guy at the information desk was very helpful. He suggested Glacier Vista or Myrtle Falls trails. The other ones were not recommended due to either being closed or not accessible. We hiked the Glacier Vista Trail. A lot of snow still on the ground. I would guess 85 % of the trail was covered with snow. So if you go please wear proper footwear. A lot of people slipping and sliding on the way down. We were luck that there were Not many people on the way up. The earlier the better. Glacier Vista was great. Great views. Not overly crowded. We were going to head over to Panorama Point but did not feel comfortable with our footwear. We Hiked over to Narada Falls after coming down from Glacier Vista. Really nice falls.

We were able to reach the park entrance in about an hour and 40 minutes, but in researching on Google Maps prior to our trip, I could see there were times when the drive time was over 2 hours. We also went in the middle of the week. We were blessed with a clear, sunny day and the views did not disappoint. We entered the park at the Nisqually entrance. Stopped at Longmire where there is a small museum. The road is extremely winding with many places to pull over and stop to see waterfalls or hike on trails. There are some trails that are easily walked and are only a short distance. We drove up to Paradise - where we were pleasantly surprised to see lots of snow on the ground! Parts of the main trails were covered in snow. This can make the walk a bit difficult without proper shoes or walking sticks. The visitor's center has a nice gift shop and a place to buy food, but I saw many families with their own picnic lunches.I think that many people only go as far as Paradise and then turn around. We chose to continue on the main road and were not disappointed with the majestic views of the mountain and valleys. However, I made the mistake of thinking the road looped back around (my mistake for not paying attention to the map), so if you do make the drive, keep in mind you will end up on the other side of the mountain. This added an extra hour to our drive back to the hotel. We left around 8:00 and returned to the hotel around 6:00pm.The other tip I would offer is that within the park and for about 20 miles surrounding the park, we had NO cell phone service, even in the few small towns we drove through, so be prepared for that.Paradise has a lodge you can stay in, but this is a trip that can be done in a day.

There are so many hikes you can do although we were somewhat limited in late June bc most of the Paradise hikes were snow covered. The peak time for hiking and wildflowers is late July/early August.

At the top we visited the visitor center, saw the movie in the theater, had a bite to eat in the cafe, and walked a little on the snow to view the peaks. we never did see the top do to cloud and fog cover. but what we did see, we liked. i would set aside the better part of the day to see and explore the area. when weather and road conditions are favorable if you have 2 days that would be better.","June 23, 2018","wonderful to see , even without being able to see it.",384,Elgin Illinois,4

The sun broke through for only a short time but we did get some good pictures of the mountain top as it started to snow pretty heavily. We were able to go to a small grocery store and buy some souvenirs in the park itself which was about the only thing open in late April.

You will visit either the Paradise or Sunrise visitor areas (don't try to visit both in one day). Hiking is the main attraction. My favorite day hike is from the Sunrise Lodge to Borroughs Mountain, about a 5 mile round-trip trek, which is a fairly easy and mostly level hike that gets you so close to the mountain that you feel like you can reach out and touch it. You'll probably see a herd of mountain goats near Burroughs, as well as a sizable bird population. Get there early in the day, as the crowds can fill the parking lot by noon.

Mount Rainier,"If you are travelling in this national park in August, you will certainly get overwhelmed with its beauty! You can enter this area from western side or from northern side. We entered from the West and started our ascend slowly and steadily. The best way to see this park is by taking breaks and exploring short trails on the way. As you drive upward on the mountain, you start getting views of this mountain from different directions, at different background and through different scenery. There are quite a few creeks, waterfalls and rivers originating from this mountain. During your journey, you continue to come across multiple creeks, and waterfalls. There are couple of stops where the trails take you to the riverbeds. These riverbeds are simply gorgeous and you can see lot of huge rocks and stones at the river bed. As you drive upward, you encounter excellent waterfalls. One thing though, in this park, you are not going to get any food. So, make sure you pack enough food and water! There are restrooms at the multiple rest areas. If you could spend two days in this park then that's even better. Unlike other major national parks, you don't have to exercise too much caution in this park. Its fairly safe to explore.","January 7, 2018",Paradise on earth!,20,"Plainsboro, New Jersey",5
Mount Rainier,"Mount Rainier is an active, 14,410 foot volcanic mountain and is located about 65 miles south of Seattle, Washington. This mountain is part of the Cascade Range and its volcano has not erupted in 2,000 years. It is the highest mountain in the state of Washington and you can easily see it from Seattle on a clear day. This mountain is the centerpiece of Mount Rainier National Park. The cost to visit is $25 per vehicle but we had purchased an annual pass earlier in the year so did not have to pay anything.I visited Mount Rainier National Park with my wife on a Saturday morning in early September and really enjoyed seeing Mount Rainier (the iconic Natural Landmark in Washington). We were lucky the weather was great and there was hardly a cloud in the sky so we had a perfect, unrestricted view of the Mountain. We drove from the Nisqually entrance to the Paradise Visitor Center and then onto the Sunrise Visitor Center so we were able to see Mount Rainier from several sides. I really enjoyed looking at the snowcapped peak and thought it was amazing (one of the coolest mountains I have ever seen). We went on a few hikes near the base of the Mountain and each one had great views of this iconic mountain. This is a very large and popular National Park with lots of hiking trails. Over 2 million people visit this big and beautiful National Park each year.Overall I really enjoyed this National Park and the iconic Mountain and highly recommend that you visit. Since this is a popular park make sure you get there early as there are not enough parking spots for all the visitors. My only complaint was that the Paradise Visitor Center did not open until 10 AM so we did not have enough water on our first hike. We were going to purchase 2 more water bottles before taking off.

Paradise was the highest point to which we could drive, and although the restaurant was closed the parking lot and restrooms were open. Breathtaking view, but cold and windy so we were glad to be dressed for it including ski hats and gloves. Changing sunlight and clouds moving over the peak were a highlight of our entire trip.Conditions change constantly, so make sure you have plenty of gas in the car and your tires are in good shape to handle rain or snow if necessary. There might be intermittent ice patches on the road this time of year caused by snow melting then re-freezing, so don't drive too close to sunset unless you are very experienced with this type of environment. We went as slow as we needed to, but used the pullouts to allow others to pass.We took it in stages after being told the peak was ""socked in"", driving up to Longmire (where Park offices, museum, and Inn are located) and then since the road was not closed we continued on up toward Paradise. The weather and visibility changed constantly, but there were many viewpoints and trailheads all along the way. When we reached Paradise, it was cold and clear and beautiful, but we would have counted the trip a success even if we had only made it part way.

Mount Rainier,"We were in Rainier for four days in September just after the first snow of the year and it was breathtakingly beautiful. The snow did not extend down too far, so the visitor's center did not have much while we were there, but all the trails were covered in ice and snow. While we missed the wildflowers of the week before, the snow really made for a different adventure. There was no wind and temps in the upper 30's for hiking Skyline Trail.

Mount Rainier,"This place caters for everyone. There are basic hikes to myrtle falls or you can walk straight up the skyline trail for amazing views of the glacier. I walked clockwise and took in the glacier trail. Great photo opportunities on the way up and you quickly lose the crowds. The first part is the steepest and worst. Don’t get me wrong. You keep climbing the whole time until you either turn around or get to panorama point. Due to snow, to keep going, you will need to climb up via the upper skyline trail before you can start the decent on the other way. Advantage of going clockwise, you can save 1 mile on the return by taking the golden gate trail. It is clearly marked. Or follow the skyline trail all the way down. Both are great trails. When you get back, treat yourself to a hot or cold drink at the Paradise Inn. Happy hiking. ","September 26, 2017",Amazing when the mountain is out,113,"Sydney, Australia",5

We had to take a drive from Seattle to the park, and it did take us a while. When you get to the park in the afternoon, be prepared to stop before getting through. There were so many cars waiting to get in, that the park rangers had to stagger them so that there aren't too many going in at once. Once we got to the top, the wait was well worth it. We couldn't believe how majestic Mt. Rainier was, and all in the United States. We took a hike and got to see more breathtaking views and wildlife that you don't get to see in Florida.

The journey by minibus took about 2 hours and once arriving at Paradise Inn visitor centre in the national park, you had 1.5 hours to hike up the various trails with varying degrees of difficulty depending on how fit you are! I recommend the Alta Vista trail for easy hiking and the more spectacular Skyline trail for the more adventurous. The paths can be steep and wearing hiking boots and taking a stick is recommended. The views of Mt Rainier are amazing once the clouds had cleared and you can see wild deer and on rare occasions a black bear roaming on the hillside. You can see the glaciers up close but can't reach them by foot as it is too dangerous. The visitor centre had restroom facilities and a restaurant suitable for families and small children. It also has a small museum and gift shop. Thoroughly recommended.","September 15, 2017",Beautiful scenery and hike,36,"London, United Kingdom",5

Mount Rainier,"There are few national parks that come close to Mt. Rainier National Park for easy access to such a diverse range of intense, spectacular beauty. The massive volcano is, of course, the centerpiece of this large park. Most people know that it is one of a number of 14,000 foot peaks across the contiguous United States. However, nearly all of the other ""14ers"" have a visible base that starts at 6,000' or much higher; the visible prominence of these peaks is typically 4,000 to 5,000'. Mt. Rainier's prominence is 13,200' - and it is simply massive. It is referred to by western Washingtonians simply as ""The Mountain"".The Mountain, although looming large over Seattle - lays a good two to three hour drive away. It is a bit further from Portland - add about another 45 minutes if traveling from that city. For a good portion of the year, the Mountain is obscured from lowlander view by clouds. That DOESN'T mean it's not worth a trip - often, the visitors centers (Paradise - open all year 'round, and Sunrise - open roughly from July 4th thru Labor Day) are sitting above the clouds, bathed in sunshine beneath the brilliant white and blue of Rainier's snowfields and glacial ice.There are a wide range of hikes available throughout the park, ranging from very short paved pathways to beautiful viewpoints or ""learning loops"" to very challenging trails requiring significant effort, skill, and time. There is certainly a trail for you in the park (check the excellent Washington Trails Association website for an exhaustive list of trails in this park and all across the State of Washington - wta.org).The most popular hikes are the day hikes that head up onto the Mountain from the two visitors centers. Most of the alpine trails in the park are clear of snow only from mid-July through sometime in mid-October or so. If visiting the park during this time of year - and it's a GREAT time to visit - be prepared for crowds. Arriving (very) early will save you the headache of parking far from the visitors center/trailhead AND from having to share the park with so many others. If visiting in the winter months - Paradise remains open except during the most severe weather. But know that if you're wanting to travel to Paradise from November through April - you'll need to have tire chains with you (NPS rules).A modest hike up from a visitors center, say 2 miles and about 1000' of elevation gained, will put you into an alpine wonderland that will remain etched in your memory(-ies) for a lifetime. Views of the massive mountains features (rock walls, glaciers, waterfalls, snowfields, moraines, etc.) will be matched by the sights into the wilderness beyond the park that lay in the other direction (the nearby Tatoosh Range, or Goat Mountain, or Mt. Adams, or Mt. St. Helens, or Mt. Hood, or the Cowlitz Chimneys, or Crystal Mountain, or the Olympic Mountains, or Cougar Falls, or Wilson Falls, or ...). All this, while breathing in air cooled by the surrounding glaciers and snow, and lightly scented by the alpine fir and pine trees through which the breezes are filtered.It's a magical place. You can visit in a day and feel charmed by MANY of the amazing things to do and see. Or you can stay for several days and explore the park more deeply.IMO, only Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Yellowstone/Tetons, and maybe Death Valley are in Rainier's league. An amazing place.","September 14, 2017",The Mountain - And It's Wonderful Park,36,"Seattle, Washington",5
Mount Rainier,"We traveled at an unfortunate time- smog from fires in Canada, and construction on the main road of the park. Even still, the views of the mountain were spectacular. We did several hikes, but the best hike was just behind the Paradise Visitor Center. It was right at the base of the mountain, and had the best views. It was also paved (but steep!) so was somewhat friendly for the baby stroller we brought along.","September 13, 2017",Beautiful views,85,"Chicago, Illinois",4

I was aware of quite a few other less able people who wanted to enjoy the amazing views but not do the hikes. My major complaint was the fact there were very few seats outside for people to sit. One small very congested area with a couple of picnic tables. And sawn logs to sit. No shade outside to sit. In the tourist centre there are three hard benches but it is extremely busy, not a relaxing place to sit. I also didn't attempt to use the restaurant as it wasn't close to the tourist centre and as far as I'm aware upstairs!

Mount Rainier,"Now that's something I never thought I'd do. Walk on a volcano. And a beautiful one at that. And the added bonus is the drive as you go towards the top to the visitor center, a drive full of natural beauty of small waterfalls & continually winding curvy roads, We went in May & the road had snow piled up on both sides. I never knew Mt. Rainier WAS a volcano but it certainly made it more exciting which added to the experience. And even as you drive thru Washington, there are places where it just stands out with its white snow capped top shining & especially beautiful in the night against the sky, glowing as though its looking over the state of Washington, guarding it. We went thru the Nisqually entrance & came to Henry Jaxson Memrl Visitor Ctr. They had a great gift shop inside, with very friendly employees and they showed a really informative film about 20 mins long. The food they sold was um...so-so. Chili & tacos & pizza slices...not much variety, unless you're into that kinda stuff. But you're there for the mountain & it is so beautiful that you just keep taking pictures of it, even as you drive thru the city & see it glowing in the dark in the night sky or shimmering in the sunlight of day. Sure you could buy a postcard showing a beautiful view of the mountain with the full moon behind it, but you kinda wanna take your own shots, right? But pull over & take the picture. Dont drive & try to do it. It'll be a screensaver shot. ","September 8, 2017",Walking on a volcano...?,63,"Miami, Florida",5

The kids were able to do the junior ranger program and we all had a blast.","September 7, 2017",Mountainous Fairy Wonderland,7,"Seattle, Washington",5
Mount Rainier,"We had expected Mt. Rainier to be amazing, as are most of the national parks. However, when we drove up from the south entrance we were just blown away. The drives alone were amazing - they were very similar to Going to the Sun Road in Glacier National Park. The farther you drive, the more majestic and colossal the mountain becomes, glaciers and all. There was still a lot of snow everywhere in July!We loved the Paradise area. The visitor center there was awesome, and sobering, as there was a display of rangers that had died in the line of duty, most during rescue missions. This is a testament to how extreme this place can be. The visitor center also had a nice gift shop and the bathrooms were newer and clean. The Paradise area can be congested and parking can be hard to find during peak times. Paradise Inn was beautiful and has a great gift shop. We ate at the visitor center and the tacos were actually really good! Both days we were at Paradise it was bizarrely clear and we had a unobstructed view of the mountain almost all day long. It was so wonderful!Do the Nisqually Vista hike, it was nice and easy, and it was mostly covered in snow still in July - we loved it. I recommend trekking poles if you hike anywhere as this is one steep mountain. We would love to hike the whole Skyline trail but it was really steep and combined with the altitude it made it pretty brutal for people who live at sea level.We ate a picnic lunch at a picnic area near the Nisqually Vista trail and it was so awesome - we had the place to ourselves and we had an awesome view of Mt. Rainier the whole time. There were also signs that said ""Do not feed the foxes""...we kept looking for them, but were disappointed that we never saw any. The drive to Sunrise was also fantastic. There were clouds covering the mountain the day we went here so we didn't get to see the whole vista, but I have heard its one of the best in the park.Overall, we absolutely loved this park and cannot wait to come back!","September 6, 2017",We were totally wowed by this place!,146,"Dallas, Texas",5

Mount Rainier,"This trail starts at the Reflection Lake parking lot. It's a great trail, well worth hiking. It's only about 2.5 miles round trip to the saddle (between Pinnacle and Plummer Peaks), but it has about 1050 feet of elevation gain, so it is somewhat steep in places. Fantastic views of Mt Rainier on the ascent, and great views looking south to Mt Adams from the saddle. MUCH less crowded than the trails that start at the Paradise Visitor Center.

This is not a critique of the Park--just that we happened to get lousy weather & due to that we could not fully appreciate the park. We also got lost--the road signs to the Visitor Center were not clear so it's helpful if you have a map with you (don't rely on your phone because service was sketchy).

Mount Rainier,The National park was absolutely amazing. The visitor's center parking lot was full and there was a two mile long trail of parked cars out side of the parking lot. Do not let this deter you. We entered the park at the Northwest Entrance near Crystal Springs Resort and followed the highway all the way around to the Longmire Southeast exit. We stopped several times. Near Sunrise we were able to see a bear in the valley below and watched him quite a while. One of our favorite stops was at Narada Falls. It is a short steep walk down to the bottom of the falls. The mist from the falls was refreshing and the sound of the thundering water was a sensory delight. There are many great places to pull of the road and take pictures. The Sunrise Visitors Center is the highest elevation you can. reach by car. You can also see Reflection Lake from a turnout on the road that is also a trailhead. Make sure to take mosquito repellent.

Mount Rainier,"My second time out to Washington State, this time I had to go to Mount Rainier NP. One of the most memorable things about this place is getting there. I drove down from Seattle, a nice drive of around 2 hours. However, the drive towards the park is accentuated by the scenic views of Mt. Rainier getting larger as you get closer. Once in the park, the mountain is hard to see because of all of the very tall trees lining the narrow road (Nisqually Entrance). The drive is not for the faint of heart. The roads are smooth, but you are climbing a mountain, so there are some very steep slopes, with minimal guardrails in areas. But the drive is well worth it. Once the mountain comes into view again it is absolutely breathtaking. Words simply cannot describe the majesty and beauty of this place.Bring your camera and bottles of water for sure. Make sure you have a full tank of gas going into the park. There was some road construction going on during my visit, causing traffic back-ups of upto 20 minutes.

With our senior National Parks Pass (if you're over 62, costs you $10 & allows you plus 3 others to enter any National park for free) we passed thru the Sunrise entrance, hit the restroom right there, then headed up to the top. Great stop & picture shots along the way; then got info & maps at top visitors' center that opens at 10 am. Walked to Emmons' Pass & took stunning pics. Tons of trails to hike up there & picnic but we headed back down the Mtn. by car & parked in lot by Naches Loop trail. Its a 3.5-4 mile hike frequented by many that takes you thru gorgeous wildflower valleys past amazing mtn views along a nicely cleared dirt trail. Be sure to hike clockwise as the 2nd half of the hike will keep Mt Rainier in front of your view. Water bottle & light jacket is all you need but theres a nice pond & a lake along the way for a picnic.So if you have an early morning start & want to spend a half day in the park, follow my plan.

Mount Rainier,We spent 3 glorious days at Mt. Rainier. Smoke from British Columbia fires obstructed the view the first day but it was out in all its glory the next two days. We spent one day on the Paradise side and one day on the Sunrise side. Both were amazing with wide flowers as far as the eye could see and waterfalls everywhere you looked. ,"August 14, 2017",The mountain was out.,100,Pennsylvania,5
Mount Rainier,"We travel often and have seen a lot of our beautiful country. My husband and I agree Mt. Rainier is the most beautiful place we've ever been. We were in Seattle for a wedding so we only had time for a day trip. Not having planned in advance, we put Mt. Rainier in Google maps. We can only figure that the route(State Route 165) it sent us was the nearest entrance to the park which was the Carbon entrance. Miles and miles of dirt road. We kept thinking surely this is going to take us ""somewhere"". Well, ""somewhere"" was Mowich Lake.....absolutely GORGEOUS and well worth the rough ride. After a short hike, we headed back the way we came from, out the park, through Enumclaw via 410, and back into the park to Sunrise Visitor's Center. After the long drive, it was only appropriate to grab a Rainier beer in the restaurant to enjoy with our picnic lunch! We took the short (approx.3miles) Frozen Lake hike and looped around a different route back to enjoy the beautiful wild flowers. A perfect day.","August 14, 2017",Most beautiful place I've ever been,75,"Goshen, Arkansas",5

However, after speaking to someone at breakfast who gave us some good advice we headed off. We entered through the Nisqually entrance, drove to Paradise and went to the Visitors Centre. We continued east to the Grove of Patriachs then headed north until we got to 410 W and then on to Seattle. Of course we stopped along the way at various spots. A good day.

Mount Rainier,"I had seen Mt. Rainier from Seattle in the past but never had been close. This trip we planned two days to see the park. The first day we went to Sunrise. The drive up was stunning with unbelievable views. Parking was not a problem as we arrived fairly early. Many trails are available according to what you can do. It was so beautiful I can't even describe it.The second day we went to Paradise. The drive up had construction delays but also some nice views. Parking lot was full when we got there, so we had to waste time riding around until something was available. Still, it was worth the aggravation. Mt. Rainier is absolutely gorgeous and worth the time to go up and see it close. We enjoyed Reflection Lake, and the wildflowers in the meadows. There were lots of birds and chipmunks. The biggest surprise was on one of the Loop Trails where there was a large group of people staring at one of the ranger stations. It was raised up and underneath was an elk laying down but looking out at us.

Could even see St. Helens from up there. Parking is affordable ($25/day) but on the NE entrance to the park a lot the trail heads leave from the same locations so parking is a complete mess. I was honestly surprised there were no park rangers organizing the hordes of cars. Without guidance people cannot park efficiently.

For anyone camping, there are no showers in the park. And most rangers don't know where showers are available. It took us 2 days to find out. We used pay showers at Packwood RV Park, and were told that they're also available at Alder Lake State Park. We were also told that the Greenwater General Store had them, but that was untrue.

There were plenty of people there but it wasn't overcrowded; parking was not a problem. We hiked to the Dege peak in the morning (a bit strenuous), then ate lunch at the ""snack bar"" (the name undersells it - they had burgers and sandwiches, as well as food you could take on a picnic). After that we hiked to Frozen Lake, which was less strenuous. We saw gorgeous flowers and a few marmots.

In my state of Michigan that kind of hold up would not be permitted or would be postings of such long waits with detour options. . This project was handled very poorly.

Mount Rainier,"We drove in from the Portland area, fully prepared for long lines in mid-July. We weren't quite prepared for all the road construction south of the park as well as within the park itself. My best estimate is that we spent a total of at least an hour waiting for flaggers to signal us through at several locations. Then we learned that the lots near the Paradise Visitors' Center were all full. Several observations are in order here: First and foremost, the spectacular beauty of the Paradise region of the park was worth every hassle we encountered. Second, now that we've been there, several solutions became apparent for those of you who might be worried about parking, bathrooms, crowds, etc. They are as follows: stop at Narada Falls on your way in. Parking and bathrooms are available. There is a paved trail from here up to the Visitors' Center, but it's quite a long hike. (A mile or more.) Also, you should know that peak times for parking crowds at the Visitors' Center are between 10 and 2:30. If you can wait until 2:30, you can test a lot even though a sign says ""Parking Lot Full."" There's also a picnic area with parking a bit closer to the main lots, but you'll also have a long walk from here. There's no water until you reach the Visitors' Center, so remember to pack water.Once at the Visitors' Center, we found the crowds heavy, but the rangers were wonderful and the hiking trails clearly marked. We also appreciated the signage identifying the alpine flora. Words are insufficient to describe the natural beauty.","July 26, 2017",Well worth the delays,49,"Vancouver, Washington",5

From there you can drive up to the most popular hiking spot, Paradise point, and you can hike up yourself as far as you want to. I have seen tours for this area up to $200, which is just ridiculous. Do this yourself, you get the freedom to hike for as long or as little as you want and you get to enjoy the scenery without having a group with you. Go during the week to avoid larger crowds too! We also got to see a Marmot up there. I hadn't even heard of them before this hike!","July 26, 2017",Amazing views and not too crowded,14,,5

It was a normal snowpack this past year, so there were still patches of lovely white stuff on the trails in mid-July. However, the snow on the Tatoosh Range, across the valley, melted quickly during our three-day stay. The trails were absolutely lovely, with Avalanche and Glacier Lilies in large swaths on the slopes. The Mountain Lupines were just starting to peek through and will be everywhere in a week or so! Families of marmots scampered about and deer were plentiful. The nights were an astronomer's dream. Our room at the Inn was comfy and we're glad we were able to stay before the Annex there receives a makeover later this month.

Take your time and stop along the way to see some of the falls, white water rivers and terrain. Lots of photo opportunities you will want to take. There may be a fee to get into the park if you don't have a pass. So be prepared for that. You can hike up the mountain on different trails.

This place is visually stunning with a gorgeous drive round the paradise loop. Even after leaving here by the grove of the patriarchs, you should turn left out of the exit and drive up the other side of the mountain around sharp bends with sheer drops beside you and no barriers in between.We stopped off for lunch just before the visitor centre and discovered that there was snow all around but no toilets open. There were banks of snow everywhere. Nevertheless we ate lunch here then as we walked away from the table we noticed a female red deer who was eating barely 10 yards away from us undisturbed.We drove up to the visitor centre and my daughter and I undertook the skyline walk before we returned to the care, drove the rest of the paradise loop and finished up at the grove of the patriarchs. We then turned left out of the exit and followed the road up and over the mountain and headed up to a lovely restaurant at a dead end which is the base of a ski resort in winter.

Wonderful hike, but uphill a lot. 1.9 miles in. Roundtrip took us 3 hrs. Some great views of Ranier. We got a Senior pass for $10 - great deal!","June 29, 2017",Incredibly beautiful ,28,"Saint Paul, Minnesota",5
Mount Rainier,"Driving route to Mount Rainier is full of different sights to see. Many lakes, rivers and waterfalls along the way to the mountain. There are plenty of trails for hiking. A must to do is a stop at Madera Falls to experience the exhilarating blast of cold water at the bottom of the trail. Certain parts of drive are thick dense forest.

Mount Rainier,"We had a wonderful and beautiful drive through the park in June 2017. We didn't have a full day, so we spent our time at Grove of the Patriarchs and the Paradise visitors center. The Grove of the Patriarchs was wonderful - the fauna ranged from massive 1000-year old trees to the tiniest sprigs and ferns. Ferngully and Land of the Giants all in one place. The trail is not difficult, so it was excellent for children as well as my parents, in their 70's. Tree roots break up the trail in spots, but it was manageable. The cable bridge (about 2/3 in to the trail) probably isn't a good choice for those with unstable footing. The drive to Paradise and down the west side was beautiful - we were blessed with beautiful views of Rainier from Reflection Lake and Inspiration Point, as well as Paradise. However, during lunch at Paradise it began snowing - so we bid farewell to the mountain and continued on our journey. The waterfalls and cascades throughout the park were all inspiring, as well as the other majestic peaks that flank Mt. Rainier.We didn't see a lot of wildlife, but we did stop for a silver fox to cross the road. It dropped the rodent in its mouth and approached our car, apparently expecting a handout. Reminder - don't feed the animals.Note about the cable bridge and the Grove of the Patriarchs. The trail follows the Ohanapecosh River about 1/2 mile, then crosses the cable bridge onto an island, where boardwalks take you through the grove. If you have someone in your group who shouldn't cross the bridge alone, the trail along the river is still very pleasant and takes you past ancient trees almost as big as those on the island.Note about snow - if you're considering Mt. Rainier, you've probably noticed is has a short season due to the heavy snows. When we visited - June 9th - only the Paradise visitors center was the only visitor facility open. Also, we were approaching from the east side of the Cascades. We weren't sure Chinook Pass would be open that day, so we came via White Pass. It was a beautiful and quite drive.","June 21, 2017",Grove of the Patriarchs excellent for all ages,10,"Boise, Idaho",5

Mount Rainier,"I have to be honest but I did not know a lot about Mount Rainier when I booked a day long tour as part of a visit to Seattle. Even on the day we were denied the iconic views due to poor cloud cover and quite a bit of snow on the ground, even in June. The tour though provided a wealth of information, and as someone who has climbed Kilimanjaro, Etna, and Vesuvius the facts and figures of this volcano are staggering. 14000 Ft. high, 30 odd Km of glacial ice on the summit, and potentially devastatingly active. All of this in a surrounding of tremendous aesthetic beauty and diverse ecology with some of the grand Douglas fir and western red cedar forests in the region of 1000 years old. It was a real treat to see and learn about such a world landmark.","June 13, 2017",A 'giant strato-volcano' classified above K2 in the world list of prominent peaks,296,"Bournemouth, United Kingdom",5

Mount Rainier,"Mt. Rainier is a National treasure, filled with massive volcanic features, scenic locations, spectacular glaciers, pretty waterfalls, miles of walking and hiking trails, beautiful campgrounds, and historic lodges. My favorites:- Drive in from the northeast corner, along the White River, then into the White River Entrance. Stay in our favorite White River Campground, then take a walk up toward the Emmons Glacier. Drive on up the road to Sunrise, for some of the most spectacular views of Mt. Rainier. Take a short walk up Sourdough Ridge, or a longer walk toward Burroughs Mtn and Glacier Overlook. A fun thing to do is hike down the famous (but steep) Wonderland Trail, back to the White River Campground, while someone drives the car back down.- Drive in the northwest corner to the remote Mowich Lake Campground. Take a relatively short walk on the Wonderland Trail to Ipsut Pass, or continue for a longer hike to spectacular Tolmie Peak.- Drive in the southeast corner (or continue down from the White River Entrance) to the large Ohanapecosh Campground, then the into the Stevens Canyon Entrance. Drive up the scenic Stevens Canyon Road, stopping at great features like the Grove of the Patriarchs trees, the super deep and narrow Box Canyon, and the chain of lakes beyond The Bench. Continue on to Paradise, where there is a huge network of walking trails out to glacier vistas such as Panorama Point. Stay in the beautifully rustic and historic Paradise Lodge.- Drive in the southwest corner, into the Nisqually Entrance, up to Cougar Rock Campground, then stopping at several wonderful vistas, such as Ricksecher Point and Christine Falls, before reaching Paradise.

The sun came out the next day and the experience was perfect - very friendly park staff, a beautiful drive into and out of the park, scenic waterfalls, a terrific visitor center at Paradise, and, of course, spectacular views of Mount Rainer and the other peaks.","May 31, 2017",One of Our Great Parks,16,"Ocean Park, Washington",5
Mount Rainier,"This is about the third time I came here. I am more of a city guy than a wildlife guy but the first time I came here I knew that everyone must visit this place at least once in their life time. So whenever my friends visit me here (or arrange to meet with me here since I have moved) I always arrange for a day trip here.It takes around 2-3 hours to drive here from Seattle, depending on the traffic. We knew that we needed to leave early and we left the hotel around 8 in the morning. We arrived here around 11am. When we left in the morning, the weather was not so nice (overcast) but as we drove closer and closer to the mountain, the sun came out. We were thrilled because as we drive closer, we see the white cap getting closer and closer to us. Once we purchased the admission and got into the entrance, we start seeing gorgeous views. The water, the woods and the snow. We visited on the memorial day weekend. Along the road op to the mountain we saw snow that did not have a chance to melt. As we got closer and closer to the Paradise visitor center, on the side of the road, we saw snow walls that was piled there by the trucks. It was quite a good contrast as we were wearing shorts and T-shirts. As we got to the Paradise visitor center, we were floored. The snow has not melted and people were skiing up there. It was quite an awesome experience. Previously I came here in late July or August and I was always able to hike a little on the trails behind the Paradise visitor center where I could appreciate the Alpine vegetation and flowers. This time I got a taste of a different view here and it was just breathtaking.

The center itself is informative. We spent a good amount of time in there checking out the summit and reading the exhibits.

Mount Rainier,"My brother and I visited Mt. Rainier NP on the celebration day of the 100th Anniversary of the NP system. We were surprised, because we had no clue it was even happening. It happened to an exceptionally beautiful day in the park and the wildflowers were stunning. Since we were staying in Packwood, we went to the Paradise Visitor Center. We went later in the day (3pm), which helped with finding close parking. There are a few places along the drive with steep drops along the edge, that can make the best of drivers a little uneasy. We decided to take a ""stroll"" on one of the trails behind the visitor center. We quickly realized it was a hike, even though the trail was paved. It was steep, but we prevailed. The lure of the mountain makes you want to keep hiking. We finally hit a nice overlook spot (which are everywhere), where we were able to take some great photos and video. I've never seen a mountain that almost seems like you can reach out and touch it. Mount Rainier quickly became my favorite place outside Denali NP. I'm even looking to go back and hike the Wonderland Trail. After seeing this magnificent place, I would say it should be on everyone's bucket list.","March 20, 2017",Best NP in the Lower 48!

The visitor center was not open and the whole place was filled with snow and bright sun. Our kids refused to leave this place after running in the snow, making snowman and having snowball fights, even made up a funny song to dance and tried to walk around in the snow. It was a day of limitless fun. After spending a hour we left this place but we did not want to leave. As it was clear bright sunny day, the mountain was fantastic and stood there with so much beauty.

Unfortunately we couldn't see the summit because it was snowing/cloudy, but it was so beautiful out. Everything looks completely different covered in snow. Note that you are required to carry chains and some may need to put them on. We drive a Subaru Outback and didn't need them to make it up to Paradise. The highlight of our trip was snowshoeing with the ranger. You start at the Jackson Visitor Center at Paradise. Sign up at the front desk and be sure to arrive early as they only have 25 spots. We got there about an hour early and there were only 4 spots left. They don't require any experience snowshoeing to go on the trip and they'll provide the snow shoes if you need them. The snow shoeing trip takes about 2 hours and you travel 1.8 miles. There are lots of stops along the way, so it's not a difficult trek and you have plenty of time to rest.

By the time we got to the end of the stairs we were all commenting on how we never wanted to look at stairs again! They seemed to go on forever, I love hiking and climbing but these stairs were at strange heights and many were really long so you could not get rhythm going up. Coming down with a full heavy pack was not fun either. However, the views from on top made us forget about our dislike for the stairs as we looked at the different mountain ranges and peaks and valleys that spread before us.

We came up at the end of October, about the last time of the year that you can explore some of the areas before they shut them down for the winter. We started our way up and it got colder and colder as you eventually get up where there is snow, fun for us as we were in 90 degree weather in FL less than 48 hours before that. We tried to go up as far as we could on the mountain (at a certain point there were park staff there instructing people to go back) and the views were just breathtaking.

We had 8 team members & 4 guides. Our team had an array of skill levels & ages. Ultimately, 2 out of 8 of us, including one guide, achieved the summit.We spent the first night of the 3-day climb at Camp Muir & the 2nd camping on Ingraham Glacier. The experience was phenomenal & highly recommended for anyone who is seeking adventure & the opportunity to test your physical & mental endurance. Mt. Rainier is one of the most spectacular landscapes I've ever seen. I would definitely climb with AAI again in the near future. This mountain is to be taken very seriously.

Mount Rainier,"I have never been to this kind of national park before. Despite the fact that we only went on a short hike, I was blown away by the beauty and diversity of it.

Mount Rainier,"First, we are not hikers, so we didn't plan on doing any trails. I cannot imagine how much time you would need if you wanted to hike! There is so much to see here. If you are planning on going to Mt Ranier, definitely only do it if it is a clear day. It is doable as a day trip from Seattle. You could go to Sunrise and then loop around the mountain and exit from Nisqually, or just enter and exit from Nisqually (which I think might be better). We originally stayed overnight at Nisqually Lodge so we could put a full day of sightseeing, but it didn’t work out because it rained the next day. Then we made the trip from Seattle on a clear day. What a difference! We started at Sunrise, which certainly does have a nice view, but I honestly don’t know if it was worth the extra time because the views are tremendous elsewhere as well. The visitors center is pretty spartan. We did enjoy the views of the White River on the way in and out of Sunrise. We really enjoyed Grove of the Patriarchs, which was an easy loop that took about an hour to walk and gawk at the gorgeous trees. Box Canyon was a cool thing to see…again, a pretty quick in and out. Reflection Lakes were our favorite. Note that there are a few lakes, so if the first one isn’t cooperating (plantlife or wind), then walk along the road to more lakes. The best one we found was off the road a bit, further west. If you walk down to the lake you will get better shots. We did go to the Paradise Visitors Center and walked up to Sluiskin Falls, which wasn’t really worth the effort, in my opinion. We did check out the Paradise Inn, which had awesome public rooms. Narada Falls were nice, though after the stunning falls at Columbia Gorge, not really worth the hike either. Ricksecker Point does offer amazing views. We didn’t have time to stop at Longmire…so that’s why I think it is better to do an in and out from Nisqually and just go as far as Stevens Canyon/Grove of the Patriarchs.","November 4, 2016",Plan your time for this amazing place,370,"Allentown, Pennsylvania",5
Mount Rainier,"We stayed first stayed in the national park camping ground which was amazing with the tall, old, magical trees. Be prepared for steep climbing in the car and sharp turns. The next night we went to the NW corner via the Washington state park and drive 7 miles up this very rough winding road, then hiked one hour up to Summit Lake where we saw the mountain glacier up close and personal. It was worth and amazing!","November 3, 2016",Views that look like they straight out of a photography book!,2,"Bogota, Colombia",5
Mount Rainier,"We were not prepared for just how beautiful and impressive Mount Rainier is. Exceeded all expectation. It is a fantastic looking mountain from any angle - both in the approach to it and up close. Only regret is that we had one day to enjoy it. Wish we had longer. If, like us, you only have one day, prepare for your visit beforehand and consider which hike you intend to take. We chose the Skyline Trail, which can also encompass Myrtle Falls and Paradise Valley. The hike isn't too strenuous and the beauty and impressiveness of it pulls you along with it. The descent is equally wonderful - passing under the glacier and valley with roaring waterfalls. Really good hike.","November 2, 2016",Essential - beautifully scenic & great hikes,394,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",5

Many pull offs to enjoy spectacular views of the mountains, waterfalls or to begin a hike on trails that will take you though forests of trees hundreds of years old. If you're there at the right time, usually in July, you can see fields of beautiful wildflowers. I camped and while eating breakfast, a huge elk walked through my site one morning. He wasn't nearly as impressed as I was. There are several places to learn about the area and the volcano like Longmire, Paradise and Sunrise.

Mount Rainier,"As a recent transplant to Washington, I wasn't sure what to expect on a recent trip to Mt. Rainier National Park. It is absolutely spectacular! I enjoyed it so much, I went back just 1 week later. If I have any criticism, it's that the Park is too popular. There are plenty of trails to get away from crowds though, and that's the best part of the Park. That, and the wildlife. On my recent trip we encountered Black Tailed Deer and a herd of about a dozen Elk. Roads can be washed out by heavy rainfall dropping boulders, or closed by snow on the way up to Sunrise.

Mount Rainier,"We went there as part of a road trip along the west coast and did unfortunately not have a weather that allowed us to see even a big part of geh mountain.While it was windy , cold and raining we did not want to miss out on experiencing some of the magic this mountain has and feeling first hand that nature is the one still in control.Hiking up to panorama point , rain turned into hail and it got cold pretty quickly. Nevertheless we saw quite a number of ""hikers"", or better people that decided to take the same route in flip flops and tshirt.Making it to the panorama point , we enjoyed the view on parts of the glaciers for as long we could stand the wind and headed back to Paradise.If you are lucky with the weather and prepared , do the Skyline trail. If you are at least up for a walk , hike up to Panorama Point. While this place is really amazing in late spring and early fall, it's always a memorable visit and a stop you won't forget for a while.Be prepared for quickly changing weather conditions and a bunch of great spots to shoot some pictures.","October 12, 2016",Impressive - every time,43,"Virginia Beach, Virginia",5

We had only a few hours, so coming from Seattle we entered the Niaqually entrance and we could not go farther than Paradise. One gets a map and some directions at the entry after paying the entrance fee. The road is well marked and has many places where the Mount can be photographed, as well as places to start treks for people who have more time at hand. There are a lot of road constructions on-going, so we had to obey three times to cross one lane segments of the route. We planned to visit the visitors center at Paradise, but the parking at Paradise was full, and this was an off-season Monday, I wonder what happens in season or weekends. Worst experience was the 'restrooms' at the Kautz Creek stop - in disaster sanitary situation, horrible smell. This looked more like a 3rd world facilities rather than a National Park in the USA.

We finally gave up and drove to some of the other sites around the mountain and just as we were about to leave the clouds pulled away and we got some great shots.

Mount Rainier,"This review has quite truthfully, been the most difficult one to start of all. For me it was akin to trying to review my own childhood home on a holiday when it was filled with family. It had literally been close to thirty years since I had visited mother Tahoma. This time my bride was with me and formal introductions were made. They seemed to hit it off. On the morning of our visit we didn't even know we were going to end up there. After dropping our kiddos off at the airport we had entire day to kill before checking into our Bed & Breakfast along the Snoqualmie River. Please see my separate review concerning that visit as well. As we departed Sea-Tac and I contemplated our direction I spied the road sign indicating the road to take to the Mountain. It was decided, we were on our way. The skies of the day were a bit dreary and dark so I knew that we had to get as far east as we could and the Sunrise Highway was the best chance of seeing the majestic views that Mt. Rainier is so famous for. To say that were were not disappointed could very well be the understatement of the year. The clouds were still hanging over us as we got close to the mountain and even as we entered the park at White River. This made the final reveal even more awe inspiring. There is a small pull-out and trail head when the road crosses the white river for the first time. It was here that I knew it was going to be tremendous day for a visit as we could now see Cowlitz Chimney's clearly as we viewed up the river valley from the middle of the bridge. Soon after departing here we rounded the bend near Sunrise Ridge and the mountain came into full majestic view. To describe the experience as breathtaking does not do it justice. There are of course many areas to pull over and to either take photos or just wonder at the splendid view. Soon we were in the sunrise parking lot and as close to the mountain as we could possibly drive. From here one must go on foot and I would highly recommend doing so. Please be careful however as the flora here at such high elevation is extremely fragile. The are signs everywhere reminding all to stay on the paths. The sunrise visitors center does not open until 10 am and we were a bit early so we did not get a chance to go in. Restroom facilities are located separate from the center and are open 24 hrs. The lodge at Sunrise was undergoing a large amount of renovation and was partially open but we did not go in.It is important to note that Sunrise is not open all year round. In the past it has usually closed in mid September. Recent later arrival of fall snows have allowed park officials to keep the area open until the end of September. On the way back out of the park we stopped off at White River camp ground. Here we checked out the camp sites, the trails along the river and the sights of the mountain from the river bed. The views were as equally beautiful from here. It would be a great to camp but dogs are not allowed on trails so that limits us to hiking outside the park. To say that we will be back to the park and the mountain is a statement of obvious sagacity. We can hardly wait until our return.We hope to see you on the trail (literally in this case), and please be kind, compassionate and respectful to all with whom you come in contact.

Mount Rainier,"It was a visual fantasy to spend three days hiking these rugged, glacier-covered mountains flanked with trees and flower-heavy meadows. Add in clear blue skies, scenic lakes, deer, black bears and marmots, and Mt. Rainier in the summer is a quintessential American national park experience. The photos say it all – amazing beauty everywhere. As other reviewers have said, during peak season – especially August – start early each morning to get parking in the Paradise visitor lot, and get ahead of the crowds. For the most popular park destinations, be there by 9am, and avoid weekends. There are overflow parking lots at Paradise but they require a longer uphill walk to the visitor center and trailheads.I used the Paradise Inn as my hiking base. At Paradise, there are many trails short and long that offer something for everyone. They begin just uphill from the visitor center. (Note the John Muir quote engraved in the granite steps on your way up!) For hikers in good shape, definitely do the High Skyline Trail loop (5.5 miles, 1700’ elevation gain) to experience the best of Paradise in a short visit. You’ll see the immensity of Mt. Rainier up close, other Cascade Range volcanoes (Mt. Adams and Mt. St. Helens south of Rainier), expansive hillside meadows with flowers, waterfalls, talus slopes, leftover winter snow, and stands of conifer trees providing shade when the sun gets intense. The Golden Gate Trail was ablaze in flowers, especially blue lupine and purple magenta, with subalpine daisies mixed in. Golden Gate continues moderately uphill from the short half-mile Mystic Falls trail and bridge, which has classic post-card views combining Mt. Rainier, flower-covered meadows, a rocky stream and the waterfall. The Reflection Lakes scenic stop near Paradise is impressive in early morning. Walk along the lake for different views and framing angles for your photos on a windless morning. Get there early enough and you may find the place to yourself and a few deer. Spend a few minutes to just soak in the beauty of the mountain and its reflection. At Sunrise (northeast park area), also arrive early to get parking. A nice six-mile hiking loop for visitors in good shape is the Sourdough Ridge--Burroughs #2 -- Sunrise Camp --Shadow Lake combo for fabulous mountain and valley vistas. The Sourdough Ridge-Dege Peak trail should also have awesome views, but I ran out of time. Between Paradise and Sunrise, the Grove of the Patriarchs Trail makes a quiet forest experience soon after the Stevens Canyon park entrance (southeast area). The half-mile takes you into an old-growth forest, with good descriptions of types of trees, and there’s a nifty swinging bridge that crosses the river. There is so much to explore at Mount Rainier. In high season it is crowded by late mornings, but once you get away from the visitor centers things are quieter, especially on the longer, higher trails. The visitors centers are nicely done with hands-on displays for the little ones, wildflower and trail information, and geologic history of the Cascade mountain range.","September 1, 2016",Magnifient Mountains and Hiking,188,"Scottsdale, Arizona",5
Mount Rainier,"One of the National parks that does not disappoint. well maintained, well marked, good visitor centers, trails, and very interesting sites.

Mount Rainier,"I spent two days hiking and visiting the waterfalls near the Nisqually entrance - I did the Tolmie Peak lookout (from Mowich Lake) and the Skyline Trail from Paradise. Both were amazing. On Skyline we had to cross a few snow patches (in mid August), which just added to the experience. Loved the wildflowers and the glaciers. It definitely helps to do longer hikes to get away from the crowds - there were tons of people there, but not up high on the longer trails!","August 30, 2016",Beautiful National Park!,29,"Alexandria, Va",5

Mount Rainier,"We looped around Mt Rainier as a long day trip with out of town guests. Most people enter on the southwest corner of the park, but we decided to loop around from the northeast corner. The drive towards the park from this direction is very scenic, through forests and small towns. Our first stop in the park was the Sunrise area, above 6,000ft in elevation. There is a ranger station, gift shop and cafe, restrooms and a picnic area. There are many trails heading out from here, some towards the mountain, and others out along ridges or around to alpine lakes. We had a picnic here and walked a short trail to view the mountain and glaciers of the northeast side. Driving back down, we continued south to the Grove of the Patriarchs - a stand of gigantic, ancient trees reached by a 20 minute walk along the river and crossing a wobbly (but secure) cable bridge. The ancient cedars, Douglas firs, and lush growth are amazing. And the kids had fun exploring along the riverbank too.The drive through Stevens Canyon is scenic as you climb higher up to Reflection Lake with a clear view of the snowy peak. A few miles further brought us to the Paradise area, with a visitor center, lodge, meadows and trails. There are several trails criss-crossing up the slope toward the peak. You can do a short hike on a paved path, or explore further passing by waterfalls, streams, and through flower filled meadows. We hiked along the Skyline Trail and enjoyed views both up the mountain and out across the valleys to the Tatoosh peaks nearby.After our hike we stopped at the lodge for dinner, with fine food in a rustic - national park lodge setting. Afterward, a ranger gave a talk on flora and fauna in the area while a fire warmed the room in the gigantic stone fireplace.We left Paradise too late to see the sights, like Narada Falls, Christine Falls, and the Nisqually Glacier on the way down the mountain, but we did stop at a quiet overlook and enjoyed the star filled sky with shooting stars, satellites, and the faint glow of the Milky Way. The is a long day trip from Seattle, so if you want to go, start early. Spending the night in the park or nearby will let you do longer hikes and see more of the park. Mt Rainier is one of our favorite places to visit.","August 27, 2016","Majestic Mountain, ancient forests, stunning views",227,"Seattle, Washington",5
Mount Rainier,"Mount Rainier is great to see, whether you only have time to drive through the park or whether you can spend a day or more hiking. Most traffic enters the park at Longmire, so consider approaching from highway 410 instead, and circling the park clockwise. The drive up to Sunrise was great. Unfortunately I encountered too many cars at Paradise to be able to park ... and that was on a week day at the end of August. It is still definitely worth a visit.","August 27, 2016",Worth a short or long trip - beware of summer traffic,12,Conroe,5

Mount Rainier,"There is likely not much else I can say that hasn't already. The mountain is simply beautiful and the park offers tons of areas to explore and get different angles of the mountain. I will say that of the four ""main"" places we went (Paradise, Naches Peak Loop Trail, Sunrise and the Summit House at Crystal Mountain) our favorites in order were Naches Peak Loop Trail, Paradise, Summit House at Crystal Mountain then Sunrise. The Naches hike is probably the best hike we've done with TONS of wildflowers and great views of Rainier. Paradise was nice and several hikes, but was fairly crowded. The summit at Crystal Mountain offered stunning panoramic views (along with a view of Mt Adams) and Sunrise was nice but we were out of gas and didn't hike - so the views directly from the visitor center were not as good as they were blocked by trees.","August 26, 2016",Simply beautiful,71,"Bellevue, Washington",5
Mount Rainier,"This is a beautiful national park and absolutely worth visiting. Please note that Google Maps may direct you to the wrong area of the park (make sure to enter ""Paradise"" and not just ""Mount Rainier,"" otherwise it will take you to the north entrance which is a good 2 hours away). The parking situation is bad, but once you're hiking it is absolutely breathtaking and worth it. Make sure to bring warm clothes as temps were 40s-50s with snow at higher elevations on the mountain hike.","August 25, 2016",Incredible views and stunning beauty,8,,5

Bring walking stick/hiking poles, sunglasses, hat/visor, clothing layers, sunscreen, water (if hiking).3. Expect your cell phones and online connections NOT to work. Pay phones available. 4. Park at pull offs on the road to take photos of panoramic views & hike down to view Narada Falls. 5. Arrive in the morning at to find parking at Paradise during summer.6. Take photos of Mt. Rainier by the Reflection Lakes. 7. Go in early August to see wildflowers at their peak.8. Visit in June to see snow or September or early October to see fall colors.9. Stay at Paradise Inn celebrating its 100th year in 2016. (Open May 20-October 3)+Try to make a reservation the day you go, or hope for a cancellation when you arrive. It's usually sold out. +Enjoy the nightly piano music and soak in the atmosphere.+Have dinner in the dining room.+Buy a soft serve ice cream cone and enjoy the deck viewing the Tatoosh Mountains.+Attend the ranger show at 8:45 pm nightly in the lobby.10. Walk less than ½ mile above Paradise Inn to view RAINIER, Myrtle Falls, Edith Creek & meadows. Continue on the Skyline Trail as far as you feel comfortable. Panorama Point is a marvelous vista.  11.

Mount Rainier,"This is a spectacular park with shady roads, huge trees and lots of photo opportunities for Mt. Rainer. We stopped at Longmire for a cup of coffee (kids will love seeing the old fire engine) and then at Paradise walked on the SkyLine Trail to Mrytle Falls. (You can also see these falls from the Valley Road.)We decided to take I5 south from The Eastside of Seattle to 512 to 7 to 706. We started out at 7am on a Thursday and didn't hit much traffic (If you have 2+ people be sure to take advantage of the HOV lanes). The road is very pretty from Tanwax to the the Nisqually entrance. We stopped at Longmire and got one of the last parking places at Paradise. We wanted to come home a different route so we went from Paradise to the Stevens Canyon exit. Beautiful drive to that exit (several places for a quiet picnic and great views of Rainer and Reflection Lakes) and then up Highway 123 (very scenic). 410 to Enumclaw is a nice drive and then you have several choices about getting back to 405/I5If you have time, I think it worth your while to go on through the park, not stop at Paradise and go back the same route.

Mount Rainier,"We stayed at a hotel in Federal Way as a base for our visit to Mount Rainier National Park. We visited the park on a Saturday, leaving our hotel before 7:30 am so that we would arrive at the park in the 9:00 hour; we were glad we got an early start because the parking lot was full--with cars waiting for parking spots--by the time we returned to our car in the mid-afternoon. It cost $25 to enter the park, and the drive to the park's entrance--and the drive from the gate to Sunrise Visitor Center, where we began our hike--is remote and scenic. Our hike was challenging, yet enjoyable; we completed about five miles with many beautiful views of Mount Rainier along the way. We wore running sneakers, which, for the most part, were adequate footwear for the trek (we did come across two icy patches that prompted us to slow our pace and proceed with caution). We wore layers and found ourselves removing jackets and then putting them back on at various points on the hike. We carried a small backpack with water and snacks and took turns wearing it. Early on our route, we encountered a handful of fellow hikers, but by the time we were nearing the trailhead in the early afternoon, the path was becoming crowded with groups and families. When we were done with our hike, we bought a few souvenirs in the visitor center, but decided to skip the snack bar's offerings in favor of a post-hike lunch at Taco Time in Enumclaw.","August 17, 2016",Highlight of our trip to the Pacific Northwest!,23,New York,5
Mount Rainier,"I hiked the Burroughs mountain loop from the sunrise visitors center. I connected with this trail via Frozen lake and took the Sunrise trail back. Out and back was probably about 6 or 7 miles with a vertical change of about a thousand feet. The views were absolutely spectacular, I couldn't really ask for better. At the top of Burroughs mtn 2, you could hear the glaciers moving, kind of sounded like thunder. Well worth the hike if you are in moderate physical shape. I also walked the nisqually loop trail. It offered great views of the glacier and was mostly paved. Narada falls was another stop for a pretty decently sized waterfall. Definitely go on a clear day and with a full tank of gas.

Mount Rainier,"My husband and I traveled to Mt. Rainier NP from Seattle a few days ago. I would recommend going very early, as there is a lot of road construction this time of year, and you have to stop a lot to allow for one way traffic while the construction workers are working. It took us about a 30 min drive to Paradise visitor Center once we entered the park from Ashford. As many have stated, you must go early to get a parking spot at Paradise visitors Center. It was nearly full when we parked around 11AM, and keep in mind the drive in at Paradise Loop, is just that, a loop, so if you pass up a parking spot and think you can turn around you cant... you have to drive all the way around the loop again. And when the parking lot is full, visitors start parking on the road, seriously up to 1/2-1 mile away, its nuts... so go early! There are many trails you can take up the mountain. Even me, at 6 months pregnant, was able to hike up for a good while, not sure how far we went. But the Mountain is just amazing!!! What a breathtaking view. All the trails were gorgeous with wild flowers, just stunning. We were lucky to have warm weather and hardly any clouds, so the view was spectacular. We spent about 2-3 hours hiking around, so yes bring plenty of water. The visitors center was swarming with SO many people as we were leaving, so again go early for a number of reasons!

The trail starts out pretty easy butt becomes a little more challenging about a mile in. Just wear decent shoes and be ready for your legs to get some exercise! The scenery is well worth it. Lake Eunice is spectacular and the last mile up to the peak is definitely worth it.

We lucked out in that it was a beautiful day and from many pull-outs the top of Mt. Rainier was visible. As a photographer, you can get pictures with a clear view, clouds coming in, clouds moving out. The roadways through the park are typical two-lane roads just like any other N.P. We had no problem stopping or finding a place to park at the pull-outs. I would imagine at some times during the year the park can be very busy. We drove from the entrance at Ashford up to Paradise to the lodge and visitor's center. It was a fantastic day and the memories you will have of the visit will remain with you forever.

Mount Rainier,"So much to see here. There are countless waterfalls, trails, lakes, mountain views, forests, and meadows here. Be sure to check the National Park Service website and Washington Trail Association website before visiting to plan your route, which hikes to consider, weather conditions, and viewpoints. Allow enough time to drive and hike, and have alternative hikes in mind in case the visitor center or trailhead of your choice is full. Last time we went, Paradise Parking was full, so we visited Reflection Lake, Narada Falls, Ruby Falls, Carted Falls, and Madcap Falls from other trailheads, and we were not disappointed. The northwest portion of the park and the south portion of the park are too far away from one another to visit in the same day.","July 31, 2016",So much to see,30,"Tacoma, Washington",5
Mount Rainier,"Avail yourself the opulent splendor of unobstructed viewing of Mt. Rainier and surrounding peaks. A modern ski lift provides a panorama of the Crystal Mt. ski runs as you climb to a clean and relaxing restaurant, viewing, and hiking area. Bring your own water and picnic if you prefer to hike. Parking is free. Wear layers because temperatures vary between sunlight conditions, exertion, and high altitude. Bring something to chew if you are prone to ear discomfort. You might happen upon a late afternoon wedding ($8K-$50K depending on features). There is a concrete platform with 50 chairs (and mighty Mt. Rainier as a backdrop). There are some chipmunks and bees, but if you think you hear a swarm it might be a drone used to film the celebrations. For most the pace is restful and reverent at the high altitude.

Mount Rainier,"Mt Rainier is spectacular. I visited Paradise and Sunrise and I was blessed with good weather to see the mountain from both perspectives. Rainier opened her curtain for about 30 minutes to show her magnificence, then she closed it with a massive cloud cover. Many visitor's do not get to see her as she is covered in clouds a lot. She stands at 14,414 feet above sea level. From the Paradise visitor center you have a great view if you cannot walk or hike. If you can walk or hike, there many trails that will take you from a half a mile to several miles above the visitors. I hiked two miles up and the 360 degree was awesome. Bring a good lunch and spend the day and avoid the fast food in the visitor center. I did not try it, but Paradise Lodge has a fine dining expensive restaurant. I highly recommend it just for the view. If you are afraid of heights, the road up will be a problem for you. I also saw the mountain from the Sunrise visitors center and it was also awesome and had many trails. I took a short one mile round trip and got a great 360 degree view. Also, I got to Paradise parking lot at 9 am and it was almost full already. By noon, you will not be able to park. Sunrise was not as crowded and I got parking even though I got there at 11am but it was full by late afternoon.","July 30, 2016",Stunning Experience,40,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",5

The spouse dropped the family off and thought he could circle back to look for parking but they force you to leave when the lot is full. This resulted in separation of our family in a spot where there is no phone service and the driving spouse had to park a mile away and walk back to us just to reunite at the visitor center...

There are many hiking trails that set off from there for people of all abilities. Perfect way to appease older boys' desire to get closer to the mountain while satisfying my desire as a mom to have a trail and not go too far into the wilderness.

Mount Rainier,"We love Mount Rainier. It sits above the Seattle area and so many people identify with it and think of it as ""their mountain"". It is rare that a mountain is so accessible, but is still so potentially volatile. There was still quite a bit of snow on some of the hiking trails in July this year. The hikes are spectacular, the mountain makes its own weather and is breathtaking. Our kids have hiked to the highest points available to them (Panorama Point and the Lakes Trail) since they were four to six years old. Our six year olds did the Lakes Trail in four hours this year and loved it. Our daughter (now 17) used to do Panorama Point very summer from the age of four. The views are incredible and the life lessons of packing the right stuff, wearing sun cream, staying on the trail and learning about the alpine flowers and their short growing season have stayed with them. The views out and back down the trail as you hike around and up Mount Rainier are spectacular and are accessible from very short distances up from Paradise Lodge.

Mount Rainier,"We visited both the Paradise and Sunrise Visitor Centers and Mount Rainier was hidden by clouds at both places. But on our way to the Sunrise Visitor Center from Paradise we stopped to see Box Canyon and lo and behold the clouds parted on Mount Rainier and we caught a glimpse of the summit. Beautiful! Both Visitor Centers have their own unique charms and my wife and I recommend you visit both. During our visit, the Henry M. Jackson Memorial Visitor Center at Paradise was very crowded and the parking lot was full and we had to park a couple hundred yards down the one-way road leaving the Visitor Center. We were lucky to find that parking space. We found someone who was leaving and followed them in our car to get their space when they pulled out. So my wife, dog, and I were able to walk around Paradise for a bit, but were frustrated Mount Rainier never appeared and our dog was not allowed beyond the parking lot. A week ago we were in Banff and Jasper in Canada and dogs are allowed on all the trails. Go figure. We left Paradise and headed to Sunrise, hoping to catch Mount Rainier there. Along the way we stopped at Box Canyon and saw the top of Rainier so, we were hoping we would get a good view of the mountain at Sunrise, but the clouds moved back in by the time we reached Sunrise and the mountain was nowhere to be seen. But, luckily, we caught that glimpse at Box Canyon. The roads were good throughout the park and the day was beautiful except for those stubborn clouds around the top of Mount Rainier.","July 27, 2016",What a Sight When the Clouds Parted!,76,"San Antonio, Texas",5

This trail should have taken us about 45 minutes, well 2 1/2 hours later we got back to the bottom! It is just the most magnificent place with views that cannot be described! At one point we were ready to go back down and we started talking with a person who said if you go up just a bit more - 20-30 minutes more - you will truly feel like you are on top of the world and/or in Switzerland - she was so right!

The place needs to be seen to truly appreciate the size and grandeur. Be sure to stop along the way as there are many pulloffs with great photo opportunities on the drive. They were working on the road up to Paradise so it took quite a bit longer to get there than we were counting on, but it was sure worth the trouble.

Before I entered the park I thought that was pretty steep, but was well worth the price of admission. There are so many scenic stops along the way. Just be careful, as roads to twist and turn with no guard rails. So be sure to go the speed limit and have both hands on the wheel. You will have a tough time trying not to be distracted by the scenery all around the outside of the vehicle; however, there are many stops to take in the moment.

On our arrival, the clouds were already there, so our views were just clouds. Since we are from the eastern time zone, we were up early and noticed that the clouds were gone at 5:00 am. Due to the fact that were were high on the mountain, sunrise was already happening, so we were hiking by 5:30 am.Our hike was awesome. We only saw one other hiker on the mountain until about 6:15 am. At that time of year, there was still a lot of snow, so stay on the path or snow to protect the environment. I would advise a day pack with a lot of water, a light jacket, good hiking boots, a whistle, and trekking poles. Do not forget your camera! The day pack that I was using was the Osprey Stratos 24 which has a nice waist strap and padded shoulder straps; it even has a built in whistle in the chest strap.My wife was wearing her fitbit and she logged 105 flights and over 15000 steps on our morning hike.The lower paths are paved, but we noticed that some of the paved trails needed some repairs.

Mount Rainier,"Mt. Rainier, at 14,410 feet above sea level, is the second highest peak in the Lower 48 states and cerainly one of the most massive and majestic. It is the centerfold of course, of Mt. Rainier National Park, and is far and away the oldest of Washington state's three national parks, becomming one in 1899, one of America's first five or six national parks. Driving through the park is a scenic wonderland in itself, but is grfeatly enhanced by stopping here and there at the vistas and turnouts, and taking advantage of short hikes to waterfalls and crystal clear lakes.The park is a mountainous wonderland, famous for its dense forests of Douglas fir, western red cedar and western hemlock, its dazzling fields of colorful wildflowers that spring up in late summer after the snow finally melts, its stupendous number and size of its snowfields snd its 25 glaciers which feed the many lakes and breathtakingly beautiful waterfalls.There is lodging at lthe National Park Inn at Longmire, which is open year-around, and at the Paradise Inn, open only in summer. Visitor centers are found at each of these two areas, plus at Ohanapecosh and Sunrise,at 6,400 feet, the highest area reachable by car. Sunrise has a day lodge, but no overnight accommodations.Beacause of the huge network of trails, hiking is very popular throughout the park, and range from easy walks of less than one mile, to the Wonderland Trail of 93 miles.Mt. Rainier is the largest of the mountains of the Cascade Range in Washington state, and is considered to be an active volcano. The Cascade Range has been volcanically active for millions of years, thanks to its location close to the western edge of the North American tectonic plate. Like Mt. Saint Helens and other Cascade volcanoes, Mount Rainier has the potential to erupt again, but volcanologists expect the mountain to give ample warning before entering an eruptive period. Although hundreds and hundreds of people climb Mt. Rainier each year, it is hazardous, and requires climbing skill, proper equipment and excellent physical condition. Climbers mucst register and pay a fee if climbing above 10,000 feet or on glaciers. You are not required to hire an authorized guide service, but common sense should scream out at you to do it.Whesther you visit just for the day in a car, or spend several days hiking or climbing, Mt. Rainier and the park surrounding it are national treasures.","July 4, 2016",Mt. Rainier the center of a wonderful National Park,413,"Gig Harbor, Washington",5

Mount Rainier,"We had limited time and could only do a one day trip. We arrived early in the day which was good as the weather went down hill as the day went on. We arrived on the first day that the main visitor's center opened for the season. The roads were cleared and fine between Longmere and Paradise. The drive to the visitors center in Paradise was about 30 minutes. It's a beautiful drive, but there are many twists and turns. They are also doing major road work so we found ourselves having to stop for as much as 15 minutes to wait for the road crew to finish a section. It looks like this road work might stretch into the season for a while.The visitors center offers plenty of parking and a few exhibits on the Wonderland Trail. There is also a short movie on the park's history. There is a gift shop and a small cafeteria. They also have water filling stations. We were fortunate enough to get a glimpse of the summit before the clouds rolled in. Lots of hiking groups departing from the visitors center to hike to the summit. There is also a climbing and hiking center there which is open and provides permit and trail maps.We took a peak inside the inn as well. It's beautiful and worth a look. Great gift shop and a restaurant and snack bar there too. Nice deck to sit and watch the hikers taking off to the summit.We wanted to do a couple of shorter hikes, but settled for only one. Most of the trails were still covered with snow. We did a short, one mile hike to see the glacier, but it was made more challenging due to the snow. About half of the hike was snow. While our hiking boots could do it, I wish we'd had poles. We were sliding around a lot. There was also a large tree that had fallen over the trail and you had to climb over it. I could see that being very difficult for anyone with mobility issues. We saw quite a few people making the hike who were not dressed appropriately for the weather (it changed every 5 minutes) or for the hiking conditions (wearing sneakers or flats). The snow (more like packed ice) was way too slippery for anything besides boots. The views, however, were worth it. Amazing. While the road was open going east, we were pretty tired after spending half a day in Paradise. We took our time driving back to the Longmere area. Stop at the pull outs. Each one offered an amazing view of something you might not expect. We also went to the museum. It's small, but worth the stop. We drove through the campground (we normally camp in the parks). The sites were really, really small. This is really a campground made for tents and not trailers. We saw a few small trailers there, but it would be a tight fit. We wish we could have stayed there long and explored more. And wish we could have been there a just a few weeks later to see the wild flowers. It's definitely worth the stop.","June 20, 2016",Our trip was too early in the season,281,"Springfield, Massachusetts",4

Mount Rainier,Every time I visit I wonder why I don't come more often. This park is a must see if you're visiting the Northwest. One clear days the views of the mountain are spectacular. There are many different hikes to choose from. With all different degrees of difficulty. If you can visit during the spring or fall that's what I would recommend. There will be less people.

Mount Rainier,"Mt Rainier has become my favorite place to climb in recent years. I can't stand the tourists who flock there, but when I get there first thing in the morning and climb up to Muir away from the hoards of imbeciles.. It is heaven on earth to me. Mt Rainier attracts some of the worst socially incompetent people to have ever set foot on the planet. They clog the trails, they tromp across alpine meadows that aren't supposed to be walked upon, they pretty much ruin the experience for the other people who show up. It sucks. If you get up high enough their numbers dwindle really quickly. The higher up you go the better the social skills seem to be. By the time you get to Muir you are surrounded by awesome friendly people. Seriously.. You could set your stuff down and come back an hour later and no one would mess with your stuff. You could leave and go climb the mountain and no one would mess with your things. People are respectful high on the mountain. Come back down and the closer you get to Paradise the worse the people become again. Useless screaming and yelling. Common sense is totally lacking too the closer you get. Get to the parking lot and see all the fat tourists who think they are at some neat destination. Mt Rainier is great, go up high and get a real experience without all the fat idiots and their kids.","June 14, 2016",Rainier has become my favorite place.,168,,5

I'm no hiker, and it was a bit of a challenge in a few places, especially with the slickness after rain. So if you've never hiked before like me, I recommend a shorter/easier trail first.

Rainier to get the glacier views is very doable though I wouldn't recommend it for those in wheelchairs or using a walker. We had seniors in our party and they were able to manage it pretty easily. We did have to pull them up/lend a hand at the more difficult parts both uphill and downhill and we took frequen ops on the way. They did have to take a couple of painkillers after returning, but that's only because our seniors are not at all active people otherwise. The drive was less than an hour and a half from our hotel in Kent and very beautiful.

The trails that were snow-free were well-maintained; those we hiked that still had snow over them appeared to be in good shape. We'd been encouraged by friends to visit the trails originating from the Paradise Visitor center, but the lot and all of the roadsides were packed with cars and people, so we opted to travel on and find less-populous trails.

Jackson visitor center you'll want to spend time viewing some of the wonderful history about the mountain and the park. There's also a nice gift shop and some dining opportunities. From the visitor center we walked out on the snowpack for a group photo and just stared at the peak of Rainier. Hats off to those who choose to climb it!On the drive back to civilization we stopped at several areas in the park for short hikes. Reflection Lake provides some incredible photo opportunities. The Indian Bar trail is a nice short hike with amazing views as well. But our favorite hike was at Grove of The Patriarch Trail, complete with absolutely stunning green water falls and pools.

Mount Rainier,We just went to Mt Rainier NP(4/28). We drove from Seattle. Tip for the wise - take the route through Tacoma; less traffic lights to deal with. Once you pass Tacoma there are not many towns. The last town we saw to get gas was Elbe so keep that in mind. The Douglas Firs are really amazing. The road closed up around Paradise which is a visitor center and lodge. The weather was very cloudy and it differs from the weather in Seattle so another thing to keep in mind. Luckily the clouds parted for about 10 minutes and we were able to see the summit. If it's cloudy more than likely you will not be able to see it. I hiked about a 1/4 mile of the Skyline Trail but the snow was too deep. I would highly recommend finding a place that rents snow shoes if you go this time of year. We also looked at Narada falls.

Mount Rainier,"It is so amazing so see this mount sitting like a frosting throughout the year! Even if it is hot weather conditions everywhere in its vicinity, it is surprising how it manages to keep it cool ( pun intended :). This is about 2 hours drive from Seattle and is one destination for people of all ages and all fitness varieties.For fittest of the league people hiking, skiing, snow walking are a few activities they could enjoy. For not so fit people walking a few steps on not so steep foot of the glacier snow , snowman making, and walking around the visiting center, visiting reflection lake, sunset point could be some of the activities. I saw some old couple bringing the folding chairs and basking in the sun watching the scenic mountain while enjoying reading. The visitor center has a coffee shop, gift shop and gallery upstairs (there is an elevator too). On the main level, there goes the movie screening every 20 minutes giving the historical and geographical insightful details about this mount. Seasons to go: Round the year. During winters one must chain the tires to avoid slipping on the snow. During summers too this place has enough snow. April is my favorite time when there's no need to chain the vehicle and also the weather is not so cold. It looses the snow from foot around May and keeps loosing it up till August. What to wear: If you are an active person, wear water proof active clothing and carry hike poles, gloves, hiking shoes et al. Winters: Pack yourself in good warm clothes covering from head to toe, sometimes it gets windy too, so do pack some wind cheater clothing. Dress up in layers is the way to go. Summers: Light clothing if fine as the Sun is very close and it gets really hot. Whatever the season be, whatever you may choose to wear but do not forget to wear a good sunscreen here. A hat/cap/sunglasses may be also good to carry. Carry some water too if you are hiking. Also carry some fruit for energy. Some days there is no fee for visiting the Mt. Those days the Cafe is closed too. So if you want your dose of caffeine, carry it (your snacks too). It is a day trip destination for those who would not hike till the peak. For those who want to hike till peak should bring all equipments needed for hiking and temporary accommodation. The hike begins early in the morning, so they might as well stay in the nearby lodges night before the hike day. It gets colder in the night even in summers, so bring your warm clothing.The cell phone won't get network here so make all important calls at least 50 miles before reaching/after leaving the rainier visitor center.","April 21, 2016","The active volcano, Mt.

Mount Rainier,"Rising majestically from the lowlands surrounding Puget Sound to the height of 14,410 feet (4,392m), this mammoth, still active volcano dominates the horizon for many miles. In fact, George Vancouver named it for his friend, Rear Admiral Peter Rainier, in 1792 when he spotted if from his ship while exploring the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound.Mount Rainier is so huge that it creates its own, constantly changing weather that supports 26 glaciers, more than all of Glacier National Park, and countless microclimates all around the mountain. Relying on weather forecasts to time your visit to Mount Rainier is a fool’s errand as it changes rapidly and often unpredictably; the good news is that on any given summer or early autumn day you are likely to experience times and locations with pleasant enough weather to make your visit enjoyable.The huge amounts of snow and many microclimates around the mountain lead to an amazing variety of beautiful natural sights to explore that make Mount Rainier, in our opinion, one of the most beautiful places on Earth; profuse wildflower meadows, glaciers, temperate rainforest, box canyons, waterfalls, tall trees rivalling the coastal redwoods, alpine lakes, hot springs and more.In our ongoing quest to visit and explore all US National Parks, while still holding down jobs, once visited, a return visit is usually not possible. However, we were so impressed with Mount Rainier, we were compelled to return a second time and a third visit before completing our goal is not out of the question. Some of our favorite parts of the park that always warrant a return include Paradise, especially the wildflower meadows above the visitor center; the massive trees of the Grove of the Patriarchs on an island in the Ohanapecosh River; the incredibly deep and narrow Box Canyon carved by the Muddy Fork Cowlitz River; and Sunrise, the highest point to which one can drive their car in the park with its excellent views of glaciers including the Emmons Glacier which is the largest in the contiguous United States.However, do not limit your visit to these areas as Mount Rainier seems to offer something special everywhere one looks and we are sure that once you visit the mountain, you will fall in love with this special place and will want to return again and again.","January 4, 2016",You Will Fall In Love,3757,"Avon, Ohio",5

But we decided to pay and enter the park anyway.The road is hilly and goes up and down at the base of the mountain as you go higher and higher.

There is snow on the mountain even in June!

The road construction wasn't too bad, it took us about 10 minutes to get through.","November 19, 2015",Need Multiple Days to see it all!,9,"Seattle, Washington",5
Mount Rainier,"Simply one of the most beautiful locations in the Pacific Northwest. It's worth the drive south from Seattle. It will take a couple hours but once you get south of Puyallup, the trip becomes scenic and more majestic as you approach the park. Once inside, you can stop on roadsides to take pictures, follow the Paradise trail to the mountain itself, and do pretty much what you'd do in a national park. The passes cost money but last a week. Make proper precautions for weather. Plan right or a climb or long hike.","November 13, 2015","Amazing drive in and out, great trails, spectacular views",2,,5

Mount Rainier,"Mt. Rainier National Park contains the highest mountain in the lower 48 states. With year round ice caps it is beautiful any time the sun is shining, although in winter there is snowshoeing at Paradise and skiing at several locations on the mountain. August is the best time to see the wildflowers in bloom and hike the many nature trails with such awesome views. The view from the ridge at Sunrise looks like you are on top of the world! From there you can see other Cascade mountain peaks such as Mt. Baker, Mt. St. Helens and Mt. Adams. Hiking to the summit requires training and guide service but simply driving to the visitor center is a display in itself through giant Doug Fir forests and past rushing waterfalls. There are lodges on the mountain or many camping areas to spend a few days. Since we live nearby, this is the number one spot we take all guests from out of town. A day fee or National Park Pass is required for entry to the park. This place is spectacular! Don't miss it!!","November 9, 2015",A Must See Vacation Stop!,5,"Eatonville, Washington",5

Mount Rainier,"We were visiting US for the very first time and spent the first few days at Seattle, we went to Mt.Rainier on our 3rd day in the country. Loved the first sight of the mountain and it looked better and better, as we got closer. We were pretty late getting to the point, but nevertheless decided to do a short trek up the mountain. It ended up lasting for about 2hours roughly. The weather was brilliant on the day we visited, it was chilly but with the right amount of sunlight. I was told that it would be harsh during winters. Had a quick lunch at the cafe and also did a couple of smaller stops before getting to the base of the mountain. We left around 7pm and went over to the reflection lake and were treated with some brilliant views of the reflection and lights on the setting sky. It was a great day on the whole.

Mount Rainier,"So my husband and I visited Seattle the first weekend of Oct this month and were blessed with beautiful weather. At first we had other plans for our weekend, but a friend from the area insisted we go to Mt. Rainier, we even almost chose Snaqualmie Falls instead. But boy are we glad we went, even the 2 hour drive was nice, I'm glad we drove, we almost did the 10 hr tour but drove instead. So glad as we were able to stop in the small towns if we wanted. After picking up some sandwiches from Safeway in a small town we headed on to the mountain. Finally we pull up to use the restroom at a small park. Even the small park in Ashford was nice and had a trail. So we head to the park entrance and pay the $20 fee. Being from TX we've never seen anything like this, we pull over just to see the small streams! So we make a quick stop to Narada Falls Trail for pics and a quick walk down the trail, and it was beautiful! Then we head over to Paradise and are left breathless! It was so nice, and not too crowded. We even watched the small film they show in the visitors center then picked up a coffee and found a picnic table overlooking this wondrous mountain. So after we eat we head up to the Waterfall trail, we took the short route. That trail was so beautiful also and not so long. Finally, we head over to Reflection lake, which blew us away also! Finally after about 4 hours we headed down the mountain and back to Seattle. I was so sad leaving but had to head out, Mt. Rainier is like Heaven on Earth, bucket list thing and a MUST DO if you're ever in Washington!","October 21, 2015",**Simply Beautiful** Fall Season on Mt. Rainier!,13,"Houston, Texas",5

Mount Rainier,"We drove up to Mt. Rainier from Seattle for a day trip. If I had known just how incredible it was going to be, I would have planned an overnight trip.It was an easy 2 hour drive from where we were staying outside Seattle, well worth it! It is a interesting drive halfway up the mountain to the visitor center and lodge. The fog rolled in halfway through our trip. So we were about to see the views going up and barely saw the road coming back down. We were told by a ranger that this is not uncommon. There are so many wonderful trails to hike. It really depends on how far and how tough of a hike you would like to take. The rangers at the visitor center are a wealth of knowledge. We spent 15 minutes talking through our hikes with one of the rangers. Take advantage of that! Conditions can change quickly. They will help you be prepared for that.The visitor center is large. It has a small but great museum to walk through. It has great information about volcanoes and the way the mountains in that area developed. They also have a gift shop and a small restaurant. There really is so much to do and see. That's why we will make it a long trip next time!","October 18, 2015",Stunning!,157,"Durham, North Carolina",5

We set out a little disappointed but that all changed very early on, the park had so much to offer besides the mountain view. Old forests, waterfalls and an amazing choice of stunning drives. We actually drove up above the clouds and watched them envelope the valley below and caress the mountain tops in the distance. It took on the form of a perfectly still and misty lake, it was quite surreal.

Wasn't expecting much from it, and when we turned up to our hotel in the rain we were even less impressed. Getting up the next day we thought we'd drive through the park on the way back to Seattle and were pleasantly surprised. Beautiful waterfalls, long winding roads, misty clouds hovering above mountain peaks. We first knew the peak when we saw a sign advising motorists to be careful of congestion and then we realised. Loads of cars were pulling over to take photos of the majestic peak of Mount Rainier in the distance. We did the drive to sunrise point to get closer to Mount Rainier and it was beautiful. The sun was out, the weather was warm(ish) and it was stunning.

It was a beautiful ride and the jackson visitor center provided absolutely gorgeous views. I wish my boyfriend would have been more up to it, I wouldnt have mind doing some hiking. Just breathtaking. The only thing that is disappointing is you have to pay 20.00 to get in and that is good for 7 days. It sucks cause we only had a day and it would be nice if they offered something reasonable for just a day. As well as we went to the other side and we get there and that visitor center was closed. I wanted to get better pics but there was no way to. So we paid money to get in but not everything was open or available. As well as they were doing line painting so that held us up for at least 30 minutes because we had to follow it.

There are dining and deli/coffee shops at Sunrise, Paradise and Longmire, and the trails around her are without equal. This Park is for all ages and physical levels.

Mount Rainier,"There are 2 popular places in the Mount Rainier Park to get an up close view of Mount Rainier, Sunrise and Paradise. I only had time to visit one of them; heard that Sunrise was best, so I headed there. The visit exceeded my expectations. I was fortunate to visit on a beautiful clear day which certainly added to the experience.Shortly after entering the Mount Rainier Park, you start the journey up to Sunrise. FYI, the fee was $20 to enter. There are lots of hiking opportunities along the way to stop, but I did not have time, so cannot report on them. But, I can say that the ride up to the summit is truly scenic; you get the feeling that you are riding to the top of the world. On the way up is a small pull off area with signage that identifies an area where fire from a volcano met the glacier's ice. Worth a brief photo stop.When nearly to the top, the road forms a U-shape and a parking lot in between. The views around the U are spectacular. You can not only see Mount Rainier, but the tops of the surrounding mountaintops. Good signage allows you to identify other mountains/glaciers. Hiking opportunity here as well.Continuing up the road a short distance, brings you to the visitor center and the end of the road. Large parking lot is waiting for you. The visitor center is not open year around and was closed when I visited in September. There were restrooms, picnic area and a snack bar. Again, good signage for understanding of the views and the hiking paths available.","October 2, 2015","Sunrise, WA was amazing",35,"Morgan Hill, California",5
Mount Rainier,"We spent another very long day exploring this national park. Luckily, we saw Mount Rainier as we left the Seattle area, because it was hiding in the clouds/mist when we were in the park. We hiked the Nisqually Vista Loop Trail, which was described as fairly easy in a guide book. It was paved, but had a lot of uphill and downhill, so not necessarily an easy walk for everyone. It did yield some really nice views of the glacier. If you take the loop in a counterclockwise direction, you will gradually get better views of the glacier as you go from lookout to lookout, seeing the best view last. We stopped at many pullouts suggested in the guidebook. A little research got great views of waterfalls, glaciers, etc. We had a nice picnic at one of the picnic areas, and had the whole spot to ourselves. It was a nice time of year to visit here.

Park in the overflow parking before the Paradise visitor center or else you end up on this one-way road after the visitor center that takes a bit to get back to the visitor center.

We left Beaverton, Oregon around noon on a Sunday and entered the park by 2:45. It was the perfect time! People were leaving as we were coming in. We used our senior pass we had purchased at Mt. St. Helens for $10, and began the 17 minute drive to Paradise visitor center. I wanted an easy hike/trail so we chose Nisqually Vista Trail of 1.2 miles. It was heavenly! We only saw 6 people on the trail for the 1.5 hours we were wandering around taking pictures of Mount Rainier and its glacier. Lucky for us it was a clear day to see the mountain/volcano. I made sure we could see it by checking the live cam before we drove up. I would suggest this because the mountain can be obstructed by fog and clouds early or late in the day. I could have stayed longer, but we wanted to go to the Paradise visitor center and learn more about the mountain/volcano. This was a good visitor center to learn about Mt Rainier and the native Americans, the natural beauty and life of the people in the area. Plus the fact that it is a volcano and the danger of possible eruption and lahar flow into the valley.

Very scenic and beautiful, although the roads are winding and curvy, be careful. The guard shack at the park entrance posts the day's expected weather which was quite helpful, although you may be able to get an earlier detail with a call to the visitor center direct. When we reached the visitor center, the temperature had dropped 20 F degrees.I recommend wearing layers of light tech fabrics (you can always shed as needed).Fog moved in instantly once we stated climbing so the views were obscured most of the way but was beautiful none-the-less. Saw several Chipmunks and Marmots and Deer along the trail on the way up to Panorama Point.A note on the trail, it starts out paved and then goes to gravel/wood/stone, which is heavily maintained and in excellent condition.

The weather the week we were in the area was not at all good. We heard it had been hot and dry all summer then started raining two days before we arrived. We rearranged our whole trip to try and be at Mt Rainier National Park on a sunny day. As we were driving in, the sun was out at the park entrance. We stopped along the way taking in waterfalls and breathtaking scenery. The closer we got to Paradise, the weather declined. It was actually raining when we reached the ranger station. They checked a visibility camera and told us we would not be able to see it all that day. I was disappointed greatly but at least I had gotten a glimpse of it even if it was from the air. A few days later, however, we were taking a ferry boat ride from Bainbridge Island to Seattle and there in the distance stood majestic Mt Rainier.

Mount Rainier,"We were crossing the Tacoma Narrows Bridge towards Seattle and Mount Rainier was really clear in front of us. We were early for check in so husband said Let's go to Mount Rainier. We had visited in May 2011, but the snow meant we only got from the Nisqually Entrance to the one way road at Paradise Inn and had to go back. We had really wanted to drive the Stevens Canyon Road but hadn't understood the snow situation (we're from the UK and it was our first US road trip).This time we entered from the north on 410 and entered by the Stephens Canyon Entrance and got to drive to Paradise Inn via the Stevens Canyon Road. It was well worth the 4 year wait, with fantastic and varied views.","September 14, 2015",We got to drive Stevens Canyon Road eventually,61,"London, United Kingdom",4

Mount Rainier,"We visited Mount Rainier from two different entrances: Sunrise and Paradise, so you can see the different sides of the mountain. Recommend to follow the guided walking tours, you will learn much more about the area, volcano, and habitats. Then you can hike on your own. Make sure to pack your rain gear and a light jacket, if it rains, the temperature can drop 15 degree or more, and it will be suddenly cold! It is so beautiful to see the wild flowers and the scenery. Paradise entrance is closer to see the mountain, and glaciers; while Sunrise is more meadows. Each has its beauty. Highly recommended!","September 13, 2015",Natural Beauty,3,,5

Mount Rainier,"What a beautiful National Park. We camped nearby at the Cougar Rock Campground, but then made the mistake of lingering over breakfast. Luckily, as we drove up to the Visitors Center at Paradise we caught some remarkable sights from various roadside pullouts, but by the time we were on the trail to the Panorma Point viewpoint, the cloud blew in for a virtual white-out. So there's a tip:start early in the day for best chance of spectacular views. And don't forget to keep yours eyes open for the wildlife around you: we saw a black bear and a red fox, as well as the ubiquitous chipmunks, squirrels and marmots. Not to be missed.","September 11, 2015",Pray for clear skies!,43,"Hong Kong, China",5

There are campgrounds located inside the park and there are services such as restrooms and food at Longmire and Paradise. There are different access points to get into the park, but we have always taken the Nisqually entrance. Any time of year you will see beautiful sites within in the park. Summers do tend to get a little busy but late September or early May are good times to see the park without crowds being a factor.

Stop in to view the waterfalls. Hike in the Jackson visitor center area. If you are comfortable driving mountain roads with hairpin turns and steep drop offs, continue east along Stevens gorge which is amazing. You will want in some areas to put your transmission in low.

Mount Rainier,"We spent a great day in Mt. Rainier National Park and wish we had allotted more time for our visit. In the morning, we drove up to the Paradise Visitor's Center. Mt. Rainier was covered in clouds, but the visitor's center is very nice and the drive is scenic. The VC has a deli, gift shop, exhibits and an informative video. Several trails leave from this spot and on a clear day, I'm sure all of them are great. We headed back to Longmire in the afternoon, stopping at the Christine Falls and Narada Falls viewpoints. Both are worth a stop. At Longmire, we walked the Trail of Shadows, which is an easy, short jaunt through the forest. Best of all, as we sat on the porch of the Longmire Inn, the clouds parted and we got an absolutely beautiful view of Mt. Rainier itself. It lasted about five minutes before the clouds moved in again. Gorgeous. If we had more time, we definitely would have done some more hiking. The entire area is beautiful.","September 1, 2015",More Than Just the Mountain,70,"St. Louis, Missouri",5
Mount Rainier,"Amazing place to do some hiking, with great trails, tons of options, and amazing views.We went to the visitor's center in Paradise, and the staff were very helpful in helping us find a hike that met our needs, abilities, and desired distance and time. We ended up doing the Dead Horse Trail and then pushing onto Panarama Point. It was a great choice, and we had a great time. One note: on weekends like the one we went, parking can be quite hard to come by.A tip: Make sure that your car is full of gas prior to leaving for the National Park. I had assumed that there would be a place to fill up (very wrong) and we were literally running on fumes when we thankfully found a gas station on the other side. It was a close call.","August 31, 2015","Awesome hiking, breathtaking views",48,"Edmonton, Canada",5
Mount Rainier,"But make sure the weather will be good. We got here when the whole area in Paradise was mostly covered in thick fog and it was raining a lot of the time. But even then, we still were able to appreciate the beauty of this place. It's just a gorgeous alpine wonderland. Occasionally, Mt Rainier would peak through the clouds which made for more dramatic photos. Most of the wildflowers in late August were dead. We definitely want to come back when they're all in full bloom and when the weather is sunnier. We did see various animals, including ptarmigans and marmots. Paradise valley is very popular and even though the weather was poor, the parking lot still filled up at the visitor center by the middle of the day. So, get here early. This was the only area we had time to visit, but if I had more time, I'd definitely go to the other corners of this park. It's an amazing place. TIP: Make sure to bring lots of warm clothing, including thermal underwear if you're here during cool weather. Wear good hiking shoes. Please obey the park rules and stay on the trails. AND DON'T DEFACE THE PROPERTY HERE! Including carving your name into the railings. It's incredible and supremely hypocritical people would visit a beautiful place and then proceed to deface it","August 31, 2015",This place will NOT disappoint - Just GO,198,,5

Mount Rainier,"Unfortunately we visited Rainier in August 2015 in the midst of the worst wildfires in the history of the state. Even while smack in the middle of the park the thick soupy haze of smoke made it difficult to appreciate the majesty of the mountain. The park is awesome with its abundance of lakes, waterfalls, and hiking trails. Longmire/Paradise is by far the most popular area, so much so that parking at Paradise is total bedlam. That said do yourself a favor and avoid the area on a late summer weekend. I'd like to see them adopt a shuttle systemlike they do at Zion.","August 29, 2015",Smokey Mountain,369,"Houston, TX",4

We had time for the five hour, five mile, Sunrise loop (1700 feet gain in the first third with beauty at every turn. It slowed us down, just as well at elevation. At sixty, we have poles for the up and particularly the long downhill return. Carry water and all forms of sun protection. Take snacks or a picnic for the dozens of spots that beg for a stop and wonder.This is also a destination summit and glacier climb.

The hikes we went on ranged from 0.5 miles to 4 miles. At the Paradise hike we saw marmots. We especially enjoyed the Reflection Lakes -- the reflection of Mt. Rainier wasn't apparent until we took a photo and could see it beautifully in the photo.

Mount Rainier,"We visited the park for a day, with members of the family who were not interested in long nor strenuous hikes. And we had a blast!We used the Southwest entrance (Nisqually) via SR 706. The National Park Service website gives you the best address for the GPS: 39000 State Route 706 E, Ashford, WA 98304. Traveling from Seattle their instructions are bullet proof: drive south on I-5 to SR 512 (exit 127). East on SR 512 to SR 7. South on SR 7 to SR 706. And then east on 706: the park will be on your right.A few miles passing this entrance you will find the Longmire museum and the National Park Inn. The museum is not a visitor center per se, but acts as such: there is a park ranger who provides good advice on trails and activities. The Inn was under renovation when we arrived. It has the only restaurant in the park open pretty much all day.Don't miss Paradise, where the majority of the hiking trails start. The views of Mt Rainier are postcard quality, right there in front of the Visitor Center. The Paradise Inn was beautifully integrated into the environment. Worth stopping by to see it inside. The restaurant opens during specific hours. If you do not manage to find it open, there are some limited food options at the hotel store as well as in the Visitor's Center.We ended up taking the Myrtle Falls trail: about a 35 minutes walk, paved, in great shape for strollers and wheelchairs. The landscape and views were breathtaking.I also recommend watching the 20 minutes video offered at the Visitor's Center. Interesting perspective of the park's bio-dynamics. Great day trip.

The gift shop had a nice selection of items at reasonable prices.Then we continued our journey towards the location called Paradise--but we wereunable to see Paradise--NOT ENOUGH PARKING!

Mount Rainier,"We just returned from a 12-day excursion in and around Seattle. We were unsure whether or not to make the trek to Mt Rainier but were enchanted by alluring views from Seattle and decided to drive on over. Best day ever!!! We checked the weather forecast and it looked promising, although when we left at 6a we had reservations bc the sky was so overcast. However, the gods smiled on us and by the time we arrived at Paradise the sky was blue and the mountain majestic. The day grew steadily cloudier so we were very happy we arrived early. We even watched a lenticular cloud form at the mountain's peak. We are in our 60s but managed the easy trails (Nisqually Vista ultimately interesting but our least favorite) and one moderate trail with no trouble. We encountered deer, ptarmigans and a hoary marmot; in fact, one young buck actually walked right toward us. The views and paths are magnificent from every vantage point (aside from Nisqually). The volunteers are friendly and helpful. Do wear comfortable walking shoes; we didn't find walking sticks or poles necessary for our intent. We were at the park from 9a-3p and had a picnic lunch in our car. (Not very elegant, but with our windshield view of Mt Rainier we weren't complaining.) The lodge is definitely worth a peek, too; check it out while you're there. Mt Rainier is absolutely a must-see on a clear day--don't pass it up!","August 25, 2015",A highlight of our trip,16,"Bloomington, Illinois",5

If you are going to the NP, book a room in the Lodge, it is an experience to be so close and have so many trails available.The Lodge is 13 miles inside the park entrance, so you will get a great visual experience of the mountain coming in. Depending on the time of year you visit the park, you may see beautiful wildflowers, they are everywhere!On hikes, you can see several other mountains in this range, St Helens, Adams are the most visible.

We saw old growth trees in two stops, two nice waterfalls, pleasant stops at historic inns (at Longmire and Paradise) and a lovely view at the top of the highest point by automobile at Sunrise point. We were from out of town and disappointed that the smoke from the wildfires in mid Washington state had drifted to obscure the views of the mountain. Still, a pleasant visit.","August 23, 2015","Beautiful park with diverse climates, unfortunately clouded from eastern fires",96,"San Francisco, California",4

Mount Rainier,"Went to the Sunrise Area of Mount Rainier with my 2 sons aged 30 and 18. We got there early, which I would strongly recommend. Mount Rainier is very impressive when illuminated by the early morning light. You have several options on this trail ranging from relatively easy to strenuous based on your ability.We went from the trail head to the Sour Dough Ridge Trail and headed west. (Be sure to get a trail map at the trail head or from the nps.gov web site). It's a moderate climb to the Sour Dough trail, but then it is levels out with some easy ups and downs until you get to Frozen Lake. Lots of views of Rainier and the surrounding mountains and valleys from the ridge.You can turn back here if you want to keep the hike easy, but we continued up the Mt. Burroughs trail to the Burroughs 1 peak. This is a climb up a 5-6 foot wide path around the edge of the mountain. A moderately steep continuous climb that isn't treacherous, but does give the feeling of being on the edge of a cliff at times. Beautiful view of the valley below, but the payoff is at the top with the view of Rainier from 7000 feet of elevation. From here you can turn back, continue on the Burroughs Trail, or take the side trip to Burroughs 2 peak which we did. You go down a short way and then up to 7400 feet. It is 1.2 miles round trip. The view from peak 2 is phenomenal. You are 2500 feet above the valley below and very close to Rainier. We stayed at the peak for about an hour, having lunch and enjoying the views. The chipmunks are quite friendly and added to the experience.You can go on to Burroughs 3 to get even closer to Rainier and 400 feet higher, but it is several hundred feet down and then back up a steep trail. We headed back to peak 1 and then continued on the Burroughs Trail. The trail goes around the south side of the mountain with views of the Emmons Glacier and Moraine.Our hike was 6.2 mile with 1200 foot elevation gain which made for a great day hike.","August 22, 2015",Mount Rainier - Sunrise Area,7,"Frisco, Texas",5

Mount Rainier,"My absolute favorite experience in the State of Washington, Mount Rainier is not to be missed! We visited in June 2015, during the craziest heat wave. It was 94 degrees at the park, and that meant hiking was not going to be very adventurous for us. But we went ahead and took on the Skyline Trail for a half-hour in (mind you, it was so HOT, with very little shade). Such a stunning sight to see, with the wildflowers out in force! I think it definitely best to visit during a cooler time of the year, so you can maximize your hiking opportunities. As for us, we enjoyed the drive around the park’s various beautiful sites. My final piece of advice: stay nearby! We did not—drove in from Seattle for the day, and you just can’t get as much out of it that way. Remember, highways in Washington move slowly, so every miles takes at least double the amount of time you might expect, especially if you are used to faster speedways. I will surely return.","August 21, 2015",Stunning,59,"Santa Clarita, California",5
Mount Rainier,"Depending on the type of National Park you are used to, there are a number of things that are useful to know before you go. We met several people who were directed by their GPS and who had not arrived for the experience they expected.- The Carbon River entrance is for do it yourself wilderness types. While there is a fee for entry, it is the honor system- there are no rangers or park personnel at this entrance (not to worry- your stub is honored at the other entrances even though it didn't come from a computer). The best views of the peak are on the road up to the lake- once at the lake, the peak is mostly hidden by the foothills. There are nice hikes where you can get to the foot of the carbon glacier and get nice views, but they are longer than some tourists might be prepared for. The lower road runs along the Carbon River and is an easier hike, and depending on the season you can walk around in the riverbed. The only way out of their section of the park is to go out the way you came in. We met people here who had been directed to ""my rainier park"" from Seattle by their GPS as this is the closest entrance, but they were disappointed to find no amenities.- The Sunrise entrance has a nice visitor center, but the food area seemed to serve only burgers and dogs and didn't smell all that great. It has a great view of the peak and is the highest point you can drive to. There are a couple of ranger talks a day, and there are long and short hikes/walks, and even the short ones allow you to see dramatic vistas. Again, the only way out of here is exactly the way you came in, which brings us to...- there are no gas stations anywhere inside the park. All the towns just outside the park have them, but the mountain and the park are vast, and so you should fuel up before driving in. While we had enough gas I think) to go to the Paradise and Longmire sites, I wasn't 100% sure and so we bailed to get gas. From talking to others I gather Paradise and Longmire are both more crowded and more casual-tourist friendly.That having been said- this is a great wilderness area, great views of one of the tallest peaks in the U.S. , and should be on everyone's must-see list. Just be sure you know what kind of experience you are seeking, and pick your entrance accordingly!","August 20, 2015",Important to know before you go!,96,New York,5

Mount Rainier,"Mt Rainier is the ultimate northwest natural park destination. The mountain is huge. Allow plenty of time, and book accommodations well in advance. The mountain, which is part of the Cascade range and the pacific ring-of-fire is heavily forested at lower levels, and offers challenging alpine climbing for expertrs at higher altitudes. Highly recommended for visitors of all ages.","August 17, 2015","A northwest gem, not to be missed.",265,"Seattle, Washington",5
Mount Rainier,"A clear, warm day in mid July was an excellent time to visit. It seemed like we saw a new view of Mt. Rainier at every turn of the road driving between the Stevens Canyon and Nisqually Entrances. So many excellent overlooks and hiking trails along the way. We enjoyed a picnic lunch along Stevens Canyon Road with the Mt.R. as a backdrop and the Tatoosh Wilderness mountains to the south (kept thinking we could almost see Mt. St. Helen's?). The Grove of the Patriarchs was amazing. At the over-crowded Henry Jackson parking lot and the over-crowded visitors center, we finally found a place to park and, along with hundreds of others, hiked up to the falls (Myrtle?) with Mt.R. in our sights every step of the way. Road construction slowed traffic considerably for a number of miles heading west toward the Nisqually Entrance to leave the park, but the scenery was still beautiful. Only there 5 hours--which it had been longer.","August 15, 2015",Perfect views of Mt. Rainier throughout the Park!,26,"Conover, North Carolina",5

Mount Rainier,Mount Rainier is the literally the most beautiful national park I've ever been. We went in the right season when the mountain peak was still covered with snow while the skirt of the mountain was carpeted with wild flowers. It was so beautiful that we could take perfect pictures anywhere we stopped. And the air was so fragrant that a smell of it would totally release all the fatigues from hiking. And the trails that we went near paradise were great. It was just like paradise.,"August 15, 2015",Loveliest national park ever been,33,"Fort Collins, Colorado",5
Mount Rainier,"This 14,410 foot snow and ice covered active volcano stands watch over both the city of Tacoma and its northern neighbour, Seattle. The mountain was named by British explorer George Vancouver for his friend, Rear Admiral Peter Ranier, but it's Native American name is Tahoma. has several glaciers on it, is the origin of more than a half dozen rivers, and is regularly used as a training peak for parties planning to climb Mt. Everest. It takes about 2.5 hours to cover the 110 miles from Seattle Center to the Jackson Visitor Center in Paradise Valley. From mid June to early September, the Center is open from 10 am to 7 pm daily. Take I-5 south to exit 127, Washington Route 512 eastbound. Take 512 to Washington Route 7 southbound. This will later become National Park Highway. Drive south on 7 all the way to Elbe, to Washington 706. Take Washington 707 southeast through Ashford to the Nisqually Entrance. Admission $15 per car for 7 days. Once in the park, you will ascend a winding road with narrow shoulders, going past Long,ire, Cougar Rock Campground, Frog Heaven (love that name), and Narada Falls before arriving at the Visitor Center. The Center has several exhibits, stunning views of the mountain, films, guided Ranger programs, toilets, a gift shop, a bookstore and a snack bar. They also have a comprehensive information desk with maps and descriptions of driving tours and over 130 walking and hiking trails. Be sure to take a jacket, sunscreen and perhaps even a waterproof if you intend to hike. Enjoy!","August 15, 2015","Amazing ""Tahoma""!",833,"London, United Kingdom",5
Mount Rainier,"I visited the park in mid-July and had a mixed trip. Only had one day to explore so only got to do the basics. This park is a hiker's paradise. Also has lots of gorgeous waterfalls and views. Saw elk, deer, birds, and a marmot wildlife-wise. So July would typically be super peak tourist time. We went on a super overcast day and even got a little rain. Due to this, we didn't get to see Mount Rainier the whole day as it was completely covered by clouds. On the bright side, many folks stayed away and we did not have to spend hours driving around looking for parking at the popular areas like Paradise Valley and Grove of the Patriarchs. Other bummer was usually July and August have the mountain wildflowers blooming. Because of the drought I guess the flowers bloomed back in April/May for only about 2 weeks and that was the end of it. Despite missing the mountain and the flowers, it is still a gorgeous park and bare minimum need to do some walking around Paradise and Grove of the Patriarchs. Got to see Mount Rainier later from farther away while visiting other places in Washington.","August 14, 2015","Missed the mountain, but still a beautiful park",96,"Oxnard, California",5

We did the Box Canyon hike (0.5 mile), The Nisqually Vista Trail was closed for maintenance so we ended up taking the Deadhorse Creek Trail, back on Skyline Trail to the visitor center, then went on the Skyline Trail the other direction to Myrtle Falls (about 2.5 miles). At Ohanapecosh, we did the Grove of the Patriarchs hike (1.5 miles). We went to the Sunrise area and did the Silver Forest Trail and the Shadow Lake loop.

Mount Rainier,"Spectacular views make this a must-see if you are in the Pacific NorthWest. We took a day trip to the Paradise area and hiked out of the Jackson Visitor Center. On the advice of friends we went early (arrived by 8 AM), and was so glad we did. The parking lot near the trail head already had more than 100 cars in it, and by the time we left 6 hours later the overflow parking down the road was already completely full. We hiked a variety of the trails out of Paradise and enjoyed over 6 hours up on the mountain. Take plenty of water, a few snacks, and a good camera - pack light, the air gets thin as you get higher up near the glacier. These are easy, groomed hiking trails that gently stretch up the mountain elevation, and the only real drawback were the number of people we passed on our way back down. At 8 AM, it felt like we had the place to ourselves, despite the number of cars in the parking lot - by noontime, we started encountering larger hiking groups and it definitely felt more crowded. We checked the weather report beforehand and discarded out jackets before we ever started - glad we did! As the crowds get bigger later in the day, volunteer rangers are prevalent on the trails to help anyone struggling with the hike. We encountered plenty of wildlife along the way, and saw many spectacular views of flowers, mountains, glaciers, waterfalls, and forests; but I can't emphasize enough, go early and miss the bulk of the crowds if you want to enjoy the peacefulness and get lots of great photos. Besides parking, the line of cars just to get into the park can get annoying during the afternoon. There are restrooms at the trailhead, and a lodge with a full restaurant and snack bar to relax at after your hike. Admission to the park is now $40 per car - better to just buy the US Park Service Annual Pass for $80 (buy online in advance - it is good nationwide.) We came into the park through the Southwest entrance and it is a 19 mile drive (30-45 minutes) to the visitor center. If you want to hike the trails in the Paradise area, go straight there first, you can readily stop at all of the picture spots leading up to the visitor center on the way back in the afternoon.","August 12, 2015",A Great Day Trip,336,"Federal Way, Washington",4

And yes the views are breath-taking because if you are from Florida, like me, or not used to walking on steep mountains it may be a little difficult. Make sure you are prepared because I definitely recommend doing the entire loop.","August 12, 2015",Breathtaking views,3,"Tampa, Florida",5

Mount Rainier,"Mount Rainier is breathtaking and spectacular from a distance. Unfortunately, during my 2 days there, the mountain was blanketed in thick fog. The beautiful drive from the Stevens Canyon entrance (East side) to the park to Paradise and then on to Longmire was a wonderful experience, even with the patches of dense fog. There are a number of hiking trails, restroom and picnic areas, and gorgeous Reflection Lake before you arrive at the Henry M. Jackson Memorial Visitor's Center, where there is a film , as well as exhibits, a cafeteria, large lobby, and a gift shop. Temperatures can be 20-30 degrees colder at the visitor's center than outside the park. Dress in layers, including rain gear, since rain and even snow showers are possible in the summer.At Longmire, you will find The Longmire Wilderness Information Center, a museum of the early days of the park, a self guided Historic District walking tour, and a number of trails. There is also a rustic lodge with a restaurant. There is plenty of parking and overflow parking. The whole experience was delightful, despite the inability to see the mountain.Ranger led walks are available at Sunrise, the highest point to which you can drive in the park.Allow 2 or 3 days if you are only driving the park.

Mount Rainier,"I'll admit to living in Washington for almost 30 years, and this was my first time visiting Mt Rainier...wow! The two mornings we visited, the weather was clear, so we had great views of the mountain. We hiked the Skyline Trail (5.5 miles) on our first day...kind of a long & steep hike for my 13 y/o daughter, but doable. It took us about 4 hours, and that was with having to do a bit of additional distance & elevation via the High Skyline Trail due to a portion of the ""regular"" trail being closed. We left Paradise visitor center for our hike at about noon, and I'm not sure if it was he time of day or the fact that we started our hike in the direction of Myrtle Falls, but there was very little traffic on the trail until we neared Panorama Point. All of the views were amazing, regardless of where we were on the trail.We took it easier our second partial day, focusing on the Longmire area where we did the walking tour near the Longmire Museum (be sure to do this if for no other reason than to see the really cool automobile suspension bridge and the views of Mt Rainier from the Longmire Community Building) and the trail to Carter Falls (again, amazing views of the Mt).We'll definitely be returning to Mt Rainier in the future...we made sure to upgrade our day pass to an annual pass for another $20 before we left the park:)","August 5, 2015",Awe Inspiring,50,"Bellevue, Washington",5

Mount Rainier,"To truly appreciate Rainier, climb it. If that's not on the immediate horizon, try stopping at the Paradise parking lot and taking a walk. The trails emanating upward are paved with asphalt at first. This keeps all of us on the trail and prevents us from destroying the fragile and slow-growing alpine environment. On the walking paths, look around for hoary marmots ... you will almost always see some, including up close. A female elk walked across the path in front of me. If you are lucky, you might spot a tiny pica (cony) among the rocks. The higher you go, the fewer trees there are. They are mostly a mix of Subalpine Fir and Mtn Hemlock, each a beautiful species.

I just followed google maps and drove from the airport and drove on 167, 410, 165 and landed at a place that splits into two, one goes to the Carbon lake and one goes into the park to the Mowich Lake- this is a super dirt road and u need to drive slowly. If u r behind a vehicle, you cannot see much because of the dust. not many people drive on this road. You will hit the park entrance, where you drop the fees (by check or by cash) into a drop box. Then you can drive all the way up to the Mowich lake. Here the road is narrow and people park on both sides of the road. Drive all the way to the roundabout, turn and come back and find a parking spot. There are a lot of trails you can take. The lake is beautiful. If you want to canoe, go for it. Carrying a map ahead of time will be useful. Find it here - http://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/upload/MORAmap1.pdfIf you are going fora casual visit like me, you should NOT take this route. take alternate route to different entrances.

Mount Rainier,"I love, love, love this national park. I just wrapped up a 4 day camping and hiking trip here - my first visit in almost 25 years. Mount Rainer NP is in my blood, it is a strong part of my family history, and it is so far the most beautiful protected land I have ever laid eyes on. The mountain is not always out, but the views are stunning regardless. If you like to be in the mountains, plan for a few days here. The park is huge and there is so much to experience. Paradise and Sunrise lodges are good places to start - you can get some background on the mountain and surrounding land, and get a better idea of what else you want to see and do while here. The only thing that made me sad was to see a little trash on the low trails around paradise (which we picked up and took with us back to the car), and people not respecting some of the signs to stay within the trails. Some in my group also witnessed a parent giving their child sparklers down in the campground. Not a good idea ever, but especially when the park is under drought conditions. We would have told a ranger but couldn't find one at the time. These protected areas only stay beautiful if we love and care for them. I can only hope this park remains as beautiful as it is now for generations to come. If you are on the fence at all about visiting this park, I highly recommend it. Takhoma (Mount Rainier) is massive, mesmerizing, and majestically beautiful. I will not let another 25 years go by before visiting again!

We stopped in for a quick bite to eat at the Paradise Lodge cafe. The view at all times was stunning. We drove on to refelction lake whcih was a serene and beautiful view as well.

We walked about half the length of this trail, but enjoyed every minute we walked there. The trail passes in a rain forest and curves quit a bit. Behind every turn there is something new and beautiful to see. A stream with cool wind, water trickling, new flowers, interesting trees. It is so magical, that you almost expect fairies to peek at you from behind the trees.","July 13, 2015","Glacier Basin trail, close to White River",34,"Plano, Texas",5

You will pass so much beauty that Paradise is only the icing and not the whole cake. Hiking opportunities abound including rugged multi-day trips. Expect the parking lot to be crowded at Paradise. Many people do not understand the difference between Mount Rainier and the Colorado 14,000 footers, but there is a big difference. The high Colorado mountains are sticking up out of a 5000 to 7000 foot plains. You can be sitting in your sailboat at sea level looking at 14440 foot Mount Rainier sticking up behind Tacoma.

Tucked in with the gift store and offering little beyond a few choices of chilled or grilled sandwiches, the food was beyond expectations, given the effort to truck in supplies.Members of our group enjoyed pre-made cold sandwiches, cheese burgers and two of us had the exceptional grilled chicken sandwiches. Juicy breast meat was topped with cheese, fresh lettuce, huge slices of tomato and onions on fresh buns. Simple but really, just great!The cafe offers assorted beverages including ales and hard cider which help to ease any anxiety which might accompany a stroll through the gift shop where much like the grill, prices are on the high side but reasonable given the height and distance one journeys for the spectacular views.","July 12, 2015",Cafe' at Sunrise Visitor Center,73,Brooklyn Center,5
Mount Rainier,"We rented a Suburban in Seattle and decided to visit Mt. Rainier. Not sure exactly what we were going to do there but perhaps a short hike, we ended up spending over 4 hours and hiking nearly 7 miles. We visited the Sunrise Area trails at the National Park visitor Center. Cost was $20 for the vehicle which include a total of 9 of us. We had 4 adults, 5 kids ranging from 11 years of age up to 16 years of age. Our fitness level was from very fit , some of the kids not in the best shape. The hike was absolutely amazing, with breathtaking views, changes in topography, beautiful scenic pictures with the family. The visitor center provided maps of different routes to walk, and the trails are fairly well marked and hard to get lost if you stay on trail. Not being avid walkers, we were able to get around fine. As usual, a few of the kids started to gripe and complain of how long the walk was and how tired they were, but as the scenery became more breathtaking and the site of snow and rugged views, they soon stopped complaining and enjoyed the hike as they had pictures and video of this grand splendor that they could take home an show to their friends and schoolmates. Be prepared with water bottles, sunscreen, light snacks. If you are not in really bad health or have any medical conditions, then I highly encourage to really push yourself to hike as much as you can to experience the once in a lifetime views. PS after the day we had a friend recommend a wonderful restaurant in Enumclaw on our way back to Seattle called Jacksons Pizza. This restaurant is worth stopping by if you have a chance and want a good place to eat at a very reasonable price","July 12, 2015",Post Cruise Stay In Seattle,148,"San Antonio, Texas",5
Mount Rainier,"Mount Rainier has been a national park since 1899 and for the last 100 years it has been possible to take a 93 mile foot path all the way around the mountain. There are numerous shorter trails as well. If you enjoy camping, there are several camping areas to choose from. But, if you are like us, either pressed for time, or unable to hike, you can still enjoy the beauty and fresh air as there are nicely paved roads along the south and the east of the mountain. Sunrise is the highest altitude that you can attain by vehicle in the whole park. It is also the best view of Mount Rainier, but if you want to get really great photos, you will have to arrive early in the morning and pray for clear weather. We arrived in the afternoon of a very beautiful day. Our trip to the mountain was overcast and drizzly, but we broke through the haze at about 2,000 feet. After enjoying a beautiful afternoon at Sunrise, we headed back down the mountain. We re-entered the haze/mist when we got down to around 2,000 feet and saw little but the fog until we got near Paradise. I like snapping pictures of beautiful scenes, but snow reflects light and makes it impossible to get a good shot of the mountain when the sun is strong. So, though we really enjoyed the awe-inspiring views, we came away with few snow-capped mountain pictures to remind us of the beauty. If you enjoy flowers, you will love the brightly colored wildflowers that carpet the sides of the roads here. The bright green grasslands contrasted with the dark green trees brought us a deep feeling of peace and tranquility. We entered the park from the South-East on Highway 123, went up to Sunrise and then doubled back and exited the park at the South-West Nisqually entrance on Highway 706. There are eating establishments in Paradise and Longmire, but only a snack bar near the Sunrise Visitor Center. We ate at the Paradise Inn before we called it a day. We enjoyed our trip so much that we plan to spend at least two days next visit. We love the great outdoors, if you do too, you will love Mount Rainier National Park.","July 11, 2015",Majestic,105,"Shelton, Washington",5

It's a steep start and at high elevation that can be tough but overall it's a very doable at hike. Took me about 4 hours. Reasonable fitness but in recovery with a sprained ankle.

As we were there on June 26, there were only a couple of ranger programs available and not all of the bathrooms were open. The time that we visited it was very hot and sunny and most of the trails do not offer shade, but they do have a main ranger center and lodge that has food, water and ice cream. Also it is difficult to get to the top of the mountain as the only shuttles are not part of the park and are done through an outside company. There are trails that lead up towards the snow, but to get farther you must go off of the trails. ","July 8, 2015",Summer Season Starts July 1,31,"Amherst, New York",5

Don't bother buying food at the Paradise visitor center - that's a disaster. The one at Sunrise is better.

Mount Rainier,"When I planned a trip to Seattle, I knew immediately I wanted to go to Mount Rainier. I booked a trip through Viator as I didn't have a car while visiting the city. The trip had complimentary hotel pick-up which was great. I could have spent hours hiking the trails. Our buses final stop was by the Paradise Hotel. There was multiple trail options to choose from. We had about 2 hours to hike. The view is absolutely breathtaking. We had unseasonably warm weather while we were there. Temp was about 86 during the day, but it didn't even phase me. There are several waterfalls throughout the trip up, and plenty of AMAZING views of the surrounding mountains. Side note: if you are driving up there on your own, entry to the park is $20. You will not have any cell service up there. I still used my phone for photos though! If you are taking a trip to Seattle I would highly recommend making a trip up here.

We took the tour on 6/25/2015, picked up at our hotel in downtown Seattle at 7:30 AM, and spent pretty much whole day for the trip.Our bus/van driver and tour guide, Chris, is just awesome throughout the trip. He is very knowledgeable about not just the Rainier park but also surrounding areas' history and culture. We learned a lot about city Seattle, Mt. Rainier, and Washington state during the drive up and back from Mt. Rainier with plenty of laughter and scenic stops in addition to several bathroom stops (believe me that you will need more than one or two stops in summer time).We had two hours on our own at the Sunrise Visitor Center where is the highest point cars can go. We took the opportunity to hike up to the timberline via Skyline Trail (5 miles). The hike is the best part of our tour - simply spectacular and most majestic landscape - as we hike up to the glacier of Mt. Rainier surrounded by faraway snow/ice capped Cascades mountain tops! Not mention the deers and wild flowers we saw on the way.Both my 11 years old daughter and I enjoyed the whole trip from beginning to end!

Mount Rainier,"Mount Rainier National Park is splendid from the drive in all the way to trails at higher altitudes. We started at Paradise (after stopping at several view points on the way such as Reflection Lake), and hiked up about 1700 feet via the Skyline/High Skyline Trails, as well as explored several other trails. Myrtle Falls was a nice easy hike we took the evening before up to the Golden Gate Trail which is more advanced. We saw deer and butterflies, felt and heard Mount Rainier rumble, smelled the beautiful meadows, found snow, waterfalls, glaciers, and more. The views of Saint Helen's and Mount Adams from Panarama Point were breathtaking. Be sure to pack snacks, sunscreen, LOTS OF WATER, maps, and visit the official website for the list of 10 essentials needed on the mountain. Conditions can change quickly and it is worth having the items listed. We found walking sticks/poles to be very beneficial at the higher elevation on the more technical trails but they are not needed for the easy trails. If possible, be sure to visit the Ranger Station. There are interactive exhibits for all ages at the Paradise station, as well as a cafeteria with a deli style menu. The Ranger programs are immersive and wonderful. Our son became a ""Junior Park Ranger"" and it got him involved in the entire trip from the scavenger hunt and work book he needed to complete to the official oath a federal Ranger issued him to reminding us how important it is to stay on marked trails. The evening stars program at 9:45 is especially well done, with Rangers who specialize in astronomy leading you through the night sky (and you can join late, until about midnight), and all three of us were enchanted by the views. The information desk does get crowded, especially on the weekends. It's worth any wait you may encounter (we waited about 5 minutes on a mid morning Saturday), because of the incredible service. The Rangers are highly knowledgeable and share recommendations. The maps they hand out are more specific to the area than the general park maps, and each interaction is a pleasant and positive experience. Whether you just want to drive up and see the mountain from the station, or intend to climb to Camp Muir at 10,000 feet, this park is packed with immersive beauty, nature, trails, and so much more!

Once you get to Paradise, there are different trails you can take. We took an easy trail. It was easy for my husband, but not so much for me. If you are not in shape or have extra weight, climbing steep slopes at time can be hard to where you will have to stop to catch your breath. It was worth it though and I would do it again. The wild flowers were in bloom and there wasn't any snow on the ground which is unusual for this time of year. So we had a wonderful day since we were able to go all the way to Paradise. Mount Rainier was always on display and never covered in clouds/haze like I have heard it can be at time. Definitely a place you would want to spend at least a full day.

If you visit or plan to visit national parks regularly, stop by REI and ask them about their parks passes and they'll hook you up. We came in through the highway 706 entrance which is closest to our house. Started off kind of slow, you really don't get a good view of the mountain until you've driven through the park a bit. I recommend driving up to the Paradise inn, and checking out some of the views. There's some trails back there as well, and bathrooms and places to fill your water bottles. Then head down to Box Canyon, and Stevens Canyon. Really great views and chances to get down with some wildlife and experience something which might not be around forever. We came down during the summers months, because some of the roads are only open seasonally, just something to remember if you're coming down during the fall or winter months. Great visit!

Mount Rainier,"It's true,--- it is possible to come to Mt. Rainier and never see the mountain. It's height makes it possible for it to create it's own weather system, so it's often surrounded in fog. That being said, it is a wonderfully planned out park and definitely worth visiting. The park was designed with the views in mind, so all trails, benches, etc. are positioned to give you the best views. We went in June and wildflowers were abundant. Saw deer, mountain goats, and lots of marmots. We stayed at the Paradise Lodge, which we would highly recommend. The visitor's center at the NP is very nice and the 21 min. video about the park is worth watching.

Ultimately it's part of everyone and everyone is part of it.Whilst on one hand the mountain remains consistent, on the other it's ever changing meaning that you may visit, but the next time you go you will notice changes whether it be the weather, a receding glacier, rockfall, dry or flooded river.You can sit and observe, walk, climb, cycle, climb, smell, touch or feel the mountain but whatever you do you must stick to the roads and trails and leave it as you find it. The mountain has endless features that make any visit a memorable one; some can be predicted others such as the appearance of wildlife cannot. One of the most noteworthy is the work of beavers that can be observed at Longmire where even if you do not see the elusive beaver you will see its mark on trees.The Mountains appearance changes from every viewpoint and as you get closer. It may be visible from many miles away, coming and going as you drive towards it before revealing itself in all it glory as you head for Paradise or Sunrise.There are numerous opportunities to stop and enjoy the mountain whether for a walk, photograph, picnic or other.After one visit this mountain will live in your heart forever.","June 22, 2015",Be prepared to be seduced!,165,"Peterborough, United Kingdom",5
Mount Rainier,"The wildflowers on the trails above Paradise were magnificent. They were early this year due to warm conditions earlier. I have no idea what they are like at peak, but the meadows were full of color mid June this year. We hiked several of the easy and moderate trails throughout the park. Several led to really wonderful waterfalls and views. The Rampart Ridge trail by Longmire lead to a view of Longmire and was not worth the effort, although the hike through the forest was unique due to the quite, dark, dwarfing effect of all the huge trees.","June 21, 2015",Wildflowers!,25,"Portland, Oregon",5

But after spending two days there, we are already planning to come back.On the first day, we drove in a loop from Packwood to the park's Nisqually entrance, then took Paradise Road, Stevens Canyon Road, Route 123, and US 12 back to Packwood. The next day we did the reverse so we saw a lot of the park that was open to visitors: from waterfalls, to huge ancient trees, lakes, marmots, deer, lush valleys, snow capped peaks, and of course Mt. Rainier. It was blanketed in clouds most of the time we were there, but there were moments when we could see its peak.There was road construction going on at the Henry Jackson Visitor Center at that time which caused delays.","June 11, 2015",One of my favorite national parks,171,Manila,5

Ohanapecosh is a beautiful campsite by the river in the SE corner of the Park. Paradise is spectacular. Sunrise was closed when we were there, but comes highly recommended. The mountain is beautiful. Be prepared for bad weather, and be aware that most of the park is forest, rock, and glacier, so don't expect a Yosemite or Yellowstone-type experience (relatively few tourist amenities inside the park).","June 6, 2015","Beautiful park, if understaffed/funded",62,,5

Plan on a 4-6 hour trip from the downtown Seattle area to allow for 2-3 stops to take a hike or see the waterfalls. Be sure and see either Paradise or Sunrise stops on your visit. We liked the 21 minute film about the mountain and park at the Paradise visitors center. Our hike on the Rampart Ridge Trail was the best part of our visit with huge trees gracing the the trail as well as many interesting rain forest like plants.

Mount Rainier,"We visited last June, as a daytrip on our way from Portland to Seattle. From all our research, it wasn't really clear what we would be able to see so early in the season--- we'd read that a lot of the hiking trails and roads would be closed due to snow but decided since we were close by and it was on our list of must see's when in the Pacific Northwest, we had to visit and wow are we glad we did! Mount Rainier was spectacular! We lucked out with a beautiful sunny day and the scenery was absolutely stunning! Be sure to take your time and stop to enjoy all the pull-offs and viewpoints- there is still so much to see in early June before all the hiking trails are accessible for the season! There are many waterfalls (some are well marked, others you just come across from all the melting snow-very pretty), streams/rivers (one had a man-made log bridge to walk across it- very cool!!), vistas galore- the views are AMAZING around every turn! Definetly worth the trip! The only area in the park that was really crowded was around Paradise- we had to circle for awhile to find a spot, so you may want to get there early!!!

Mount Rainier,"Even if you don't go to the park itself to visit, on a clear day this is a most impressive sight from almost anywhere in the area. The mountain rises to over 14,400 feet, and is the prominent feature, even from many miles away.We were in the area for over 2 days. We stayed at the base, in Alexander's Country Inn, and it was a quick drive to the park entrance from there. Since there is normally still lots of snow in the area at this time of year, things are still closed, but the road was open all the way up to the visitor center at Paradise. We went up three times, hoping to see the summit (which was clouded over the first two times we tried).On our last day, the clouds had moved away, and the scenery was amazing! Here are some things we did and really liked:1. At the entrance, and for a number of miles, the forest is very different. It reminded both my wife and me of something you might see in Lord of the Rings.2. We did the mile-long walk at Longmire, across the road to the hot springs area. We HIGHLY recommend this walk. Amazing vegetation, historical sites, trees growing in weird places, etc.3. The drive up to Paradise is worth it, even if the mountain is clouded over. There is still some astounding scenery and waterfalls, trails, etc. to do on the way up.4. I borrowed a pair of snowshoes and poles from the hotel, and on one of our excursions to Paradise, I hiked up the mountain on my own one day (my wife wasn't feeling good, so she opted to stay in the car and sleep). This was a brand new experience for me. I got up high enough and into a snow storm. Also, I could hear, deep beneath me, a low cracking sound. Since I didn't want to be part of an avalanche, I opted to quickly crest the hill I was headed toward, and make my way back down. I also encountered very fresh bear tracks.This was a fantastic way to spend 2-3 days. We highly recommend it!","May 22, 2015",Spectacular sight!,218,South Africa,5

Enter the park through the Nisqually Entrance in the southwest corner of the mountain (must pay $15 admission fee per vehicle), then drive along the picturesque Paradise Road that winds up the slopes. The first attraction is Christine Falls, about 4 miles from the park entrance. To view this fall, you must park on the right as you're driving up the slope and do a quick hike down to the creek below. Also near here is the Comet Falls Trail (2 miles / 30-45 mins each way) that lead to Comet Falls, one of the park's most popular destination. Continue driving along Paradise Road and you'll land at Narada Falls with a parking lot on the right. Then go another 3 miles and you'll reach Paradise Inn where you can find some lodging, or use as a jumping point for a hike deeper into the park, such as the trail leading to Myrtle Falls with a beautiful view of Mount Rainier as your backdrop.

Mount Rainier,"I always give Mother Nature a 5 star rating. How could I not? However, I did not like this park as much as I have other national parks like Yellowstone or Glacier. The mountain is truly magnificent and hiking up around Paradise provided the best views I have ever beheld of any mountain range I have hiked. Yet, the park itself is a tad more enclosed than others. Some people are going to like this more, but when I drive, I really like to see a lot and I don’t mean just a lot of trees. Granted there are places here and there but most spots require effort and while that is fine, I also like to be able to take a day and just drive and see a lot! Also, I wanted to go back someday and take my mom but I don’t think this park is as conducive for her at her age like many other parks would be. Now, Mount St Helens has a lot to offer anyone especially someone who cannot get out and hike any distance. I entered via the southeast entrance on HWY 123 off of HWY 12. I chose this route because I heard in Yakima that HWY 410 was under construction and had long delays. I had no delays.Now this can change so check accordingly. I would go to nps.gov website because they have construction schedules planned out months in advance.The drive in was fantastic with hardly anyone on it. There is no gas until you get right outside the park. It is a one pump with small convenience store. Higher prices than normal, of course, but not as high as Ashford on the west side. I found it a little confusing when I would look at the map and see that one town would have a symbol indicating it was supposed to be a certain size and yet hardly anything was there and certainly no gas. You cannot rely on maps for your gas. Fill up when you can. Remember, cell phone service is hardly existent around this area with none in the park. I lost reception entirely when I turned on HWY 12 outside of Naches just past Yakima.Some of my favorite sites were:Grove of the Patriarchs – easy and very peacefulBox Canyon – short and easy (love narrow canyons)Reflection Lakes – easy with nice views of RainierNarada Falls – short hike but steep (really NICE large falls!)Christine Falls – short hike, not too bad (also very nice) worth the effortParadise areaParadise Loop road has one or two nice pullouts.Skyline Trail – 5.5 miles and strenuous (most gorgeous views of the entire mountain range at top). Golden Gate Trail – 1 mile, moderate (starts at Paradise Inn and joins Skyline Trail or if you are hiking clockwise, the Golden Gate splits at the 3 mile marker on the Skyline. From here, it is 1 mile to Paradise Inn. Golden Gate cuts through the valley so at peak season, this is where most of the wildflowers are. Also has numerous waterfalls coming off the valley walls.Myrtle Falls – easy and short, about 1/8 of a mile up the Golden Gate Trail starting at Paradise Inn (NICE falls). The rest of these falls can be seen on Paradise Loop road. So, if you are leaving Paradise Inn (it is one way leaving), then just down the hill on the left is the rest of Myrtle Falls coming through a narrow gorge. Grab a parking spot to the left or right.Sunrise AreaEmmons Vista Overlook – only a half mile round trip if that. There are 2 or 3 good viewpoints overlooking Emmons Glacier and a glacial lake below. I did not do Sourdough Ridge because I did Skyline the day before. A couple of nice pullouts right before Sunrise gives one a nice range of the area. Sourdough is open all the way in direct sun. Sunscreen and water!The whole drive to Sunrise, give or take a spot here and there, was mostly trees. Even Rainier was not visible most of the timeOn the road to Sunrise visitor center is White River. I liked it enough to stop.I did not continue past the Sunrise entrance heading north.Mather Memorial ParkwayI really liked this drive. This is part of HWY 410 that I originally would not enter through due to construction. I only went down to the tunnel because traffic was backing up. This is the kind of drive I like to take in a national park. There are large pullouts on either side to accommodate many cars. You can get nice landscape shots. Pacific Crest Trail crosses near the tunnel.Tipsoo Lake is pretty and I heard the hike – about 2.6 miles - provided great shots of Rainier. If you don’t have time to hike it but want a great picture then continue driving up the hill (heading east) and there is a pullout where one can get an overview of the lake and hill behind it. One could also park here to take the Naches Loop trail across the road which is touted to have excellent views as well.This is part of the Chinook Scenic Bypass. According to the National geographic map, the Chinook continues at the “T” and heads north past the Sunrise entrance. This makes sense because that is also HWY 410.There are several nice things on this route! Each visitor center has something different to offer. I thought rangers at this park were aloof - not rude just did not care to be bothered. Come prepared with your own info is all I can say.Parking is easy in the morning but starting around 10 am (peak season in August) people start to roll in and by 11 am you can forget parking at some small spots.She is a beauty of a mountain – enjoy!","January 6, 2015",She is beautiful,471,"Gatlinburg, Tennessee",5

We drove from Bellevue and traveled clockwise around the mountain so that we would have the sun hitting the mountain as we traveled from the north around to the east, south to the west. Great direction to travel thru Elbe to Rt. 410 and travel the loop. Many people enter the park thru Longmire, but we found the other direction much better for taking photos of the mountain without shadows. We left Bellevue at 9:30 AM and got back at 5:00 PM and stopped and took pictures every place we could. We did not do any of the hikes (did short walks), but certainly we could have if we were there when it stayed lighter later. ","November 11, 2014",Spectacular Roadtrip,2,Bourne,5

Mount Rainier,"We have visited 35 national parks and Mt. Rainier ranks right up there with my favorites. The park views are wonderful and the hiking is phenomenal. We stayed at Paradise Inn which is close to many trailheads. Some trails near the inn are paved allowing everyone access to the great outdoors. We were there in September and the crowds were still heavy. We hiked with a naturalist to a great view of the Nisqually Glacier and learned a lot about the geology of the area. I was surprised to learn that this mountain top is accessible by just about anyone who wants to try for the summit, however I wouldn't recommend that unless you are very fit and prepared. A permit is required and be aware this is not a hike, but a climb! However the lower trails can be as easy or difficult as you'd like. Just pick between the trail that goes straight up or stays level, they all have lots of waterfalls, long distant views and yes, even wildflowers in September. Many of the Paradise trails stay within view of the inn, so you can't get lost. This is a beautiful park.","November 6, 2014",Spectatular!,240,"Noblesville, Indiana",5
Mount Rainier,"Mt. Rainier was the sixth national park I visited on my 16-day trip. I got there early--8 a.m.--to beat the Saturday crowd. Since I have an annual pass (cost: $80.00), there was no additional admission charge. The park is HUGE, so even one day was just not enough time. The natural beauty is almost overwhelming. Much of it seems to be geared to the climber and the hiker, but there is plenty of roadway for the auto tourist. The route I chose offered numerous turnouts conveniently placed to let us vacationers get out of the way of those driving through; however, there were several moments where the traffic was so light, I was able to leave my car in the middle of the road to take pictures. I’m afraid I couldn’t truly capture the beauty of the scenery.

Mount Rainier,"A blur of gray mist environed us the entire route of our circumnavigation of Mount Rainier. It dampened neither our appreciation or nor awe of this wild and mysterious place – ever changing at every curve. And, oh mercy, there are plenty of curves! Moral: Don’t let the weather deter your visit.Entering the park at the Nisqually Entrance you are immediately embraced by a deep, quiet, inland rainforest. Waterfalls are plentiful. Mountainous vistas are wild and unapproachable except by experienced, able-bodied hikers. Content to stay on paved roads, we intersected Route 123/410 and exited the park just north of the White River Entrance. This is a route that could take a couple hours or a couple days depending how engaged you wish to become with the mountain. Roads are open according to the season; another indication of just how untamed this region is.A journey well worth your effort.Date of Visit: 17Oct14","November 2, 2014",On the Edge of a Mystic Wilderness,124,"Wichita, Kansas",5
Mount Rainier,"My spouse and I visited Mount Rainier National Park on a Saturday afternoon in early August 2014. Mount Rainier National Park features valleys, waterfalls, sub-alpine meadows, old-growth forest, and glaciers (including the two most famous glaciers, Carbon and Emmons). The park entrance fee is $15 per car, which is good for re-entry for seven consecutive days.In 1899, the United States created Mount Rainier National Park as the fifth property in the national park system. The park encompasses 370 square miles (about 236,000 acres), and its crowning jewel is Mount Rainier, a 14,410-foot active volcano. Mount Rainier is the tallest volcano in the United States, and it is the fifth-highest peak in the US. Geologists consider Mount Rainier to be an “active” volcano because they predict that it will erupt at some time in the future, although they cannot predict when.Elevations in the park range from 1,600 feet to 14,000 feet near the top. Every year, nearly 1.8 million people visit the park. Of those millions of visitors, about 10,000 people attempt to summit Mount Rainier, but only 5,000 climbers are successful. The busiest times to visit are July and August. Guests can enter the park from several entrances: Sunrise, Nisqually (Longmire), Paradise, Ohanapecosh, and Carbon River. In comparison, in the winter months, only one entrance to the park (Nisqually) is open because of heavy snow and poor road conditions. No gas / refueling is available within the park, although you can camp and picnic in various locations. Full-service dining and lodging are available at the National Park Inn and the Paradise Inn. We entered the park from the northeast corner near Sunrise, and we drove through Ohanapecosh, Paradise, and Longmire. We exited the park via the Nisqually entrance (near Longmire and Ashford). We drove an 80-mile, 3-hour loop throughout the park, stopping to visit interesting viewpoints. We tried to visit the Sunrise Visitors Center / Day Lodge, but an electronic message board at the road turn-off stated that the parking lots were full and to expect more than an hour wait time. Because it was approximately 2:00 pm and we had no time to spare, we headed for our second choice, Paradise. We parked our car and walked around at two different locations near Paradise, including the Henry M. Jackson Visitors Center. The wildflowers at Paradise were in their blooming season, so we saw some colorful alpine fields. The Paradise area contains lodging, restaurants (both full-service and casual), a visitor center, and picnic areas. The park is truly spectacular; however, only the passenger was able to enjoy it, because the driver had to keep his eyes on the road, which was windy and treacherous at times! Next time, we will hire someone to drive us around, or perhaps take an organized tour, because the park views are gorgeous! Even if you are short on time, spend a few hours to visit Mount Rainier National Park. It was one of the highlights of our trip to the Pacific Northwest.","October 29, 2014",Spectacular Views!,917,Pennsylvania,4

Mount Rainier,"Honestly, if I could rate this higher I definitely would. And hopefully your visit is/was/will be better than ours. However despite the majestic background of the mountain, the park itself could seriously use some improvements (other than the construction trucks that made the trip there so incredibly slow and frustrating). Even though we had an up to date map, we missed a few of the turn offs because turning signs were either facing away from oncoming traffic OR were completely missing (ironic, since there WERE plenty of signs stating that there were no gas stations in the park). The few food stops didn't offer the healthiest fare, so consider packing your own when you visit. And surprisingly our interactions with the Park Rangers could have been a lot better as well. In the 4+ National Parks visits we've made this year, the Rainier Rangers seemed like they couldn't be bothered and had no interest in interacting with the kids. In fact, our kids decided just to keep their activity booklets as souvenirs and not even try to get a badge.

Mount Rainier,Mt Rainier is one of the earliest National Parks and developed after planning. You can access it from Seattle either to Paradise Area or Sunrise Area. The drive from Seattle itself is amazing with a number of viewpoints to admire the majestic rainier. Paradise area is open throughout the year whereas Sunrise is open only during Summer.We chose to drive to Paradise area - a two hour drive. Once you are in Paradise area visit the visitor Centre to acquaint yourself. The Centre closes early some days. It has a theatre screening films about rainier which are worth watching if you have time. We watched restless mountains.There are numerous trails for you to choose and explore and enjoy nature. We chose the moderate Dead Horse Creek and Moran trail.. If you are adventurous you can chops Skyline or Panoramic Point. The views are breathtaking.The Cafés at Paradise Inn and Visitor Centre provide adequate choices for you to eat though a tad expensive.If you plan for a longer stay consider staying at Paradise Inn.

Mount Rainier,"Mt. Rainier is really the king of the mountains of the lower 48 states.... in many ways. It's the tallest (14,410 feet) and biggest, and in many ways the most majestic. On clear days it can be seen from more than a 100 miles away. The scale (and beauty) of the mountain is stupendous.Allow plenty of time for a visit. We made the mistake of a mid-morning start from Seattle (two and a half hours away) and ended up rushing much of our visit in the park. Start early and stay till dark! Or stay overnight or several nights to really enjoy fully.From Seattle-Tacoma, there are basically two routes to the park. SR410 leads you to the northeast entrance of the park and the Sunrise Visitor Center, the highest point in the park you can access by car. It's also the smoother, straighter, and faster route. The second route is via SR706, to enter the park from the southwest at the Nisqually entrance. The regular entrance fee is $15/car, good for a week.Note that there is no gas available in the park and only limited food/dining available for sale at the visitor centers. Good idea fill your tank and pack plenty of snacks and food for the day. Also, no mobile phone coverage in most of the park.The weather at the mountain is unpredictable, but it's good to check as closely as possible to improve the chances of visiting when there are good views of the mountain. The NPS website has up-to-date weather forecasts and live weather cams that are very helpful. Combining altitude, clouds, sun and rain, it's difficult to plan clothes for the park...best to rely on lots of layers and good to have rain gear if planning any lenghy hikes.Both visitor centers at Paradise and Sunrise are very good, with spectacular views and great short trails. The 21-minute film about the park is worth viewing. Probably best to visit Sunrise in the morning, when the rising sun is striking the mountain, although we went in the late afternoon and the meadows were also spectacular at that time.Lots of beautiful waterfalls, glacial streams, forests, and meadows in the park. Don't miss the Grove of the Patriarchs...massive 1,000-year-old cedars, Douglas fir, hemlock and silver fir.

Mount Rainier,"I visited Mt. Rainier in April 2014. Only one waterfall/hiking path was open and we made our ascent in our car the landscaped changed from green, snowless land to about 12 feet of snow with a path plowed through it. This visit we encountered no snow, but we were able to visit three falls. Beware that the map they give you is not the greatest for ""hiking"" trails or finding the falls. We stopped by carter falls and the sign pointed to the left and directed us to the falls, but you need to walk over a very rocky path for about mile and a half and up a steep incline. If people in your party are not in shape--don't bother to hike this--it's not a long hike, but it is over rocky and steep terrain for parts of it. It is worth the photo op to walk to the bridge that heads to the path. If you continue up a few miles you can access the falls pretty close to the parking lot. That being said it is still a steep decline/incline. Tips: It's cool up there--bring some layers. There are not many places to eat and the food at the top is expensive and isn't too good. So pack some snacks/lunch. You can find restaurants before or after you leave the park in Elbe. Bring a good map if you plan to hike. These are not trails with signs everywhere telling you where to go. Make sure you car is gassed up. Also do not accidentally go to the wrong side of mount rainier--you want the south entrance if you plan to drive to the top.

Then we took the Nisqually Vista Trail which begins in the lower parking lot of the visitor center. It is an easy, 1.5 mile round trip walk with good views of the Nisqually Glacier. We saw deer on this hike. Next we went to see Narada Falls. It's worth the short walk down for a view from the bottom. We ended our day with another 1.5 mile hike, Grove of the Patriarchs.

I did not go to the trail but just into the National Park and to Paradise so I'm re-posting my comments to the correct site:One of my favorite places to visit is National Parks. We went up to Paradise Inn from Spanaway, WA on a Monday. The road is very winding and narrow, so plan on giving yourself plenty of time to be safe. Along the way, there are several places to pull offs where there is something of nature exciting to see, such as a waterfall coming down the mountain and under a bridge, or such as Alder Dam. Additionally, we stopped at what I will call Rainbow Falls. I am a senior citizen and have had recent foot surgery, but I did not come all the way from Texas not to walk down to the ""seeing"" point. I kept my hand on my son's back going down because I feared slipping on the loose gravel, but I needed no help going back up. The falls come down the mountain and with the sun shining, there was a rainbow in it. Very Nice. After this, we drove on up to the Paradise Inn. Very typical of a National Park Lodge like at Grand Canyon or Yellowstone, (but not as big as the one at Old Faithful). But it was very nice, great ambience and great gift shop. My son in law and his kids took a hike up the mountain there. They saw fields of flowers and the girls loved it and wanted to go further. We were on a limited time frame, but all 9 of us liked it and I would really like to revisit again and take that hike to see the flowers. This is really nature at its finest--like Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park, Grand Canyon National Park, Palo Duro Canyon (Texas) etc.--just great to see the natural wonders of this beautiful world.

Mount Rainier,"If you are anywhere near Mount Rainier in Washington state, you must go to the National Park. The scenery is just breathtaking. The road throughout the park takes you by valleys, waterfalls, and the prettiest scenery. The road has a cliff on one side that can be quite scary. There are plenty of places to pull off and take pictures. There are numerous hikes you can take, many are very strenuous. But if you can try and walk to the vista. Leave yourself plenty of time to go to both Paradise and Sunset. One day in the park is really not enough time.

Mount Rainier,"To say that Mount Rainier dominates the view in this part of Washington would be an understatement. It is breathtaking from a distance and almost heartbreakingly beautiful up close. We went to the Henry M. Jackson Memorial Visitors Center at Paradise. It is a bit of a walk from the parking lot but there is a loop to drop off anyone who can't make the walk. The visitor's center offers a commanding view of the mountain (if clouds cooperate). There is a theater, snack bar, gift shop, nice restrooms, and a sitting area. There are a variety of displays, some interactive, about the mountain. We then took the loop trail to view the Nisqually glacier. I'm a girl from the desert and this was my first look at a glacier and all I can say is, ""Wow"". It is an easy trail but does have some steep parts. We saw strollers and wheelchairs being navigated successfully though. The wild flowers in the area make it look like a fairy land. Be aware that the road at the time we were there (Aug '14) was under construction. There were some delays and rough patches but nothing horrible. The trip through the country side and up the mountain only added to the trip.","September 6, 2014",Mount Rainier rules,79,tucson az,5

It was a rigorous uphill climb with delicious huckleberries to pick along the way and wonderful views of Mt. Rainier from about half-way up to the top. Mt. Rainier was huge from this trail.

Rainier was the best!","September 5, 2014",Shriner's Peak Hike - Amazing views,6,"Derwood, Maryland",5
Mount Rainier,"We drove about an hour to get to Mount Rainier and felt it was really worth the drive. The roads leading up the area are pretty and just part of the experience. When we entered the park, we made sure to stop at the various look-outs to see the sites. Some of them have better views than others, but it was a fun to get out and walk around to see everything. The top of Mount Rainier wasn't viewable the day we were there because of all of the clouds, but we did get an idea of just how high it must go up. We weren't able to stop at the visitor station because the parking was completely full and the walk to get to it (from the closest parking location) was just too far and up a fairly steep climb. If you're in decent shape it shouldn't be a problem, but if you have any problems with inclines, it would be extremely tough. Even though, we still enjoyed ourselves and experienced as many of the views as possible. There were a lot of bees at some of the stops, which was a bit disconcerting.. but I guess it was the time of year for them. Also, the peak (what we could see) still had some snow -- in August!","September 5, 2014","Beautiful Scenery, worth the drive",24,"Orlando, Florida",5

It takes you through old growth forest, to a great look-out area to see Mount Rainier, past a large waterfall and finally to a high alpine meadow.

We circled twice before we could find anywhere to park at all, and then it was so crowded and full of strollers, etc. The food at the inn is so overpriced and terrible in the long run if you ask me. The trail was harder than we thought but we had beautiful views, saw lots of wildlife (marmets, chipmunk, pheasants), the weather was gorgeous, but the people around us ignored signs and trampled off the trails over the wildflowers and onto ice mounds. Zero respect for the park and the wildlife! So disappointing!

Mount Rainier,"Full day trip for Seattle, but well worth the trouble. It was a long drive, somewhere between 2-3 hours each way, depending on traffic. You will be outside of cell phone range for most of that time, so plan accordingly. The views are stunning. You see streams, waterfalls, animals, wildflowers, and glaciers. Plan to start your visit at the visitor center at Paradise. It’s a good place for lunch followed by short hikes on one of the may trails that start from there. There are trails at all levels of expertise from rough back-country hiking to paved trails suitable for wheel chairs or strollers. Unlike a museum, you are not going to a single destination or to so something in particular. You are going for the experience – to see the majesty of nature around you, and to see mountain scenery.Words of caution – because you are in the mountains, expect it to be chilly – even in the middle of summer, the temperature may only get up to 60 degrees F at the warmest. Also, beware the weather. Seattle is notorious for unpredictable weather with rain and clouds constantly changing. Don’t plan to visit Rainier on a specific day and blindly stick to that plan. Instead, leave yourself a window of a couple of days for your visit – wake up in the morning, check with weather at Paradise, look at the web-cam on the Park website, and make sure there is no fog at the mountain. If there is, defer your trip to another day. There’s nothing to see in bad weather.","August 28, 2014",Surrounded by Stunning Views,101,"Downsville, New York",5

Mount Rainier,"This was the last national park stop during our West Coast (LA to Seattle) road trip. I think we were lucky because we had very good weather for day hiking and when we arrive the top of the mountain was clear - later in the day clouds covered the top. My wife and I hike Reflection Lake one morning and it was just as the postcards portray - good some good pictures.I hike up to Glacier point (not sure of the trail name) one afternoon and really enjoyed the trip. Seeing the glacier up close and walking across the snow field was a lot of fun. Both hikes were very easy although be sure to wear good water proof footwear when going to glacier point because snow run-off flows right down the trail over a portion of the hike.One Tip: You best get to the park early, otherwise you will have a hike just getting to the visitor center (or lodge) from the lower level parking lot. A shuttle bus from the lower lots would be helpful.Overall it was a great park to end our road trip on and if I ever get a chance I will definitely go back.","August 20, 2014",Very good day hikes,83,"Monroeville, Pennsylvania",4
Mount Rainier,"It was the best camping ever with breathtaking view of Mt. Rainier at sunrise and otherwise too! Mt. Rainier National Park has amazing trails and numerous campgrounds and we enjoyed at White river campground. The campground has good flush toilets. The day use area toilet has hand wash installed, the camp toilets do not have hand wash so best to carry your own hand wash and toilet paper. Loop D was the best as it is the closest to White river. Sunrise point is about 30 minutes drive from the campground from where you have a choice of various trails. The drive itself is so scenic and breathtaking. The roads are windy and at times the drive gets edgy too, so we had to be careful not to get distracted!! :) At the Sunrise point, there are many restrooms. After refreshing ourselves, we chose the Frozen Lake trail, spent some time at Frozen Lake and returned by the Wonderland Trail. If one has the stamina, then one should try Fremont Lookout trail ahead of Frozen Lake. Our 4-year old was exhausted so had to head back from Frozen Lake. Hiking poles were very useful. We kept ourselves hydrated every half-n-hour as we were sweating a lot. After the hike, we headed to our campsite and warmed our food and filled ourselves sumptuously. We brought prepared food from home for lunch as we had planned the hike pre-lunch. So did not want to spend time cooking. In the evening we did photography over White River adjacent to the camp with exquisite scenery presented by the trees, river, and Mt. Rainier!! Next day, early morning we stationed ourselves on the White river with our tripods to catch the changing hues of Mt. Rainier as the Sun started rising! It was a heavenly experience to catch the phenomenon and it was so exhilirating. I am sure we could have the whole peak of Mt. Rainier from Sunrise point but we were not in a mood to drive again. We had the best time there and wish to visit there again before the Summer gets over!

Mount Rainier,"I needed a respite for a couple of days, and this was the best! If you have a couple of days, visit Paradise, Sunset and the Carbon River and Mowich Lake Ranger station. I spent a day at each, and over night at Paradise Inn. The Carbon River has at least 5 great short hikes carved out in the old growth rainforest. It is breathtaking, to say the least. Haven't been to the Pacific Northwest in 17 years, and I am so glad I took the time to see the beautiful mountain! You can bike on some of the trails! I stopped at the Ranger Station to get info on road closings as well as find out which hikes were the best for the time I was up there, very helpful rangers.I drove up to Paradise to visit Mt. Rainier Paradise Visitor Center, and ended up staying at the Paradise Inn over night. Had a great dinner, met wonderful people and was lulled to sleep by the lightning show and soft thunder in the off distance. Woke up to a room with no electricity, as it went out in the middle of the night. Just added to the rustic ambiance of the ancient mountain setting.Drove to Sunrise after breakfast and took a couple of short walks on the east side of the great mountain.

Mount Rainier,"What a magnificent day trip! We came in from the North via the scenic Hwy 410 and I was glad to be with my friend from Bellevue who knew the park well because there was no entry gate (fee) or park map available. I usually go online in advance to plan my trips, but because I was with a local and frequent visitor, we went places that I probably would not have seen. In retrospect, when entering from the North on Hwy. 410, do stop at the White River Information Center on the road toward Sunrise for a map and current park info.The scenic drive on 410 from the North is preferable because Hwy 12 from the east is much more populated and commercial. The park is 97% wilderness, and the roads (very twisty with sheer drop-offs) were actually designed to produce breathtaking views as you round the corners. And they do produce ahh haa's repeatedly. It is an active but dormant volcano with fragrant, virgin forest and enormous old-growth conifers, moss, banana slugs (kids love them) plus over 300 glaciers, the most in the contiguous US.We began near Chinook Pass and hiked about 1.5 mi up to her favorite spot overlooking Dewey Lake. Unfortunately, most of the wildflowers had peaked due to the warm, dry weather this summer. The views of the valleys was fabulous, although the mountain was partially obscured by fog which we hoped would burn off. It was surprisingly uncrowded there on a Sat morning at 9:30. We then hiked down to the clear turquoise lake, maybe another mile or so, to look for tadpoles. Nada, which surprised her this late in the season (Mid-Aug). The scenery and topography carved by glaciers was majestic as we headed back up to the car. Mt. Rainier was still partially obscured by fog, but still amazing, especially as we got closer or saw it from different angles. The fresh, clean alpine air, aromas and views are breathtaking everywhere in the park.We continued south on Hwy 123 to the Grove of the Patriarchs and then a short hike to Stevens Falls (park entry with $15 per car for a week or use NP pass for free entry) where we ate our PB&J picnic lunch. The park is enormous and food is expensive and not always nearby when you get hungry, so bring your own food & drinks.We had not planned to go to Paradise, but since we were almost there, we decided to see the lodge. There were numerous patches of colorful wildflowers still blooming at this higher elevation. It was about 3 pm when we arrived and overflowing with cars, buses and people. It is wise to begin here early in the morning to beat the crowds, but we managed to snag a parking spot about 1/2 mi away and walked into the visitor center just as the movie was starting. That is a must-do as it is very informative. We then went to the lodge and marveled at the common area with a unique piano and clock, massive fireplaces and hand painted lanterns. Then, we took an easy 1 mi hike to Myrtle Falls before returning to our car. It was about 2 hrs back to Bellevue. (note: I-5N on every Sunday is bumper-to-bumper and crawls, so allow double time for a return or try to go on a weekday) Also, the park roads that we took are east & north of Paradise and only open seasonally. Check online before departing!Hints: Plan ahead by going online for the park newspaper and ranger events and maps (link below) to get the layout of the park so you are able to maximize your visit by knowing what is available and arranging your priorities. The park is enormous, so you can't do it all in a day!Wear hiking boots or sturdy shoes and layers of clothing. Bring sunscreen, a hat, raincoat and insect repellant.Bathrooms are busy so bring toilet paper & hand sanitizer. They often run-out by noon.Pack snacks, sandwiches & drinks or stop in Enumclaw (Safeway, Subway & other options)Be aware of wildlife, including black bears.Consider camping or staying at the lodge to more easily attend the various ranger led events and night time astronomy.Enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.  http://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/brochures.htm","August 19, 2014","A Majestic, Volcanic, Alpine Wilderness & Glaciers",415,"Cardiff-by-the-Sea, California",5

Mount Rainier,"Wow, what a natural beauty Mt. Rainier is! We recently hiked about a 6 mile loop trail during an 80 degree day with blue skies, how awesome! We were rewarded with breathtaking views, several marmot sightings, some short treks through snow and waterfalls. I can't wait to go again!Here are my tips.A. We came in from the Paradise side, $15.00 per car is the National Park Fee, your Washington Discovery Pass doesn't work. We didn't realize this ... it's worth it, we just didn't realize it.B. There are several great trailheads on the way up to Paradise Inn, we want to go back and try others.C. Get there as early as you on the weekend so you can park in one of the close parking lots, otherwise you end up in an overflow lot or on the street, it is a long walk to the Inn and Visitor Center then, especially for elderly or anyone. I'd suggest by 10am. I'm assuming weekday isn't as bad.D. For the hike, if you're doing one of the lower loops, think about heading to the right of the lodge first, most people went to the left and there was a steady line of people, especially as the day wore on. We went to the right, and had the 1st mile or 2 to ourselves, and then started bumping into people coming the other direction. E. Depending on your shape, be prepared for a hike, my wife and I are avid walkers, and it was still a bit strenuous at time. The couple we were with lagged slightly behind and hadn't been as active as we had been lately, we took several breaks.F. We forgot bug spray, and there was one section near the creek where there were a lot of mosquitoes and we all wished we had sprayed some on.G. Wear sunscreen. Even though it's cooler in the mountains, you are closer to the sun. My wife got a nice burn on her shoulders as she was wearing a tank top.H. Wear proper clothing. I don't know how many people we walked by that were in jeans, uncomfortable shoes and were miserable. A lot of people think, ""oh, we will just do this little loop"" and it is more difficult than that. Also, be prepared for the distance. We went by one mother/father and their two kids who were halfway in and struggling. The Mom said they didn't know what they had gotten into. The 3 yr old girl was crying a lot. The upper trails are definitely a hike. Some kids were loving it, some people were miserable. I. Have water with you. You will want some along the way. We packed a lunch and stopped and ate which was great.J. Be prepared for people during the weekend especially. As we got closer to our return side, the number of people multiplied time and time again. The views are great the entire way, but this is by no means a solitude hike, if you want solitude, try one of the lesser used trails as you head into the park.K. Keep your eyes open for critters. We saw several marmots along the way which were fun and entertaining. We saw a bear cub going across a meadow on our drive out. Always have your eyes peeled.L. Have a different pair of shoes to change into when you get back to the car, and maybe a shirt. Nothing better than having a fresh pair of shoes and a clean shirt after a 5+ mile hike where you were breaking a sweat in the summer weather. M. Be prepared for snow, we ran into some, just soft and slushie and you can totally walk on it, just realize you will likely encounter some. N. We saw a few people starting the trail with strollers ... then they end up having to carry them. Once you get off the paved portion, the strollers would be quite difficult.Overall we had a great and beautiful hike, on our next trip, I'd love to do it during the off season, when it is less crowded.","August 19, 2014",Great hike from Paradise Inn,64,Yakima,5

Mount Rainier,"Mount Rainier National Park has much to offer to those people who enjoy natural beauty. However, one must be aware of a disappointed bus tour company, namely Tours Northwest, 8219 7th Ave. South of Seattle, Washington 98012, which I am sorry now that I took. I picked up a pamphlet at our excellent hotel, Westin, so I did not check out any reviews online. It was an eleven hour trip for $119.00 on a bus with dirty windows and no toilets on board, which only left me with bad memories. It was the bus driver, Chris, who used humiliating tactics to passengers, namely me, which ruined my day's trip. After I write this review I plan to write to the company to tell them of his verbal abuse. I learned before this trip that you do not argue with ""the person driving a vehicle"" so I did not say anything to him. I will not go into detail, but I want to warn others that this company employs drivers who use verbal abuse to ""keep its passengers in line.""The bus driver told us not to take the time to see the video presentation at the Paradise National Park Center, as it too long. I did see it, and it was an excellent presentation of the beautiful Mt. Rainier National Park. Instead he recommended the restaurant at the park. My traveling companion went to the restaurant, and she ended up spending the entire time there because of the very slow service, and never did get the coffee she had ordered. I am glad I brought my lunch with me, so I could eat outdoors at an area provided by the park. I have traveled in all 50 states of our country, as well as in Canada, Mexico, and Europe, but never encountered such a demeaning tour guide/driver.

Mount Rainier,"Mt. Rainier has miles of trails at lower elevations for the weekend walkers to explore with stunning views, colorful flowers and wildlife that you can almost touch. But this is one of the classic mountains to climb in North America. There are several companies that take guided climbers from the Paradise Lodge parking lot to the summit and back again. It's a 2-day trip and it is a LONG SLOG. You must be in good physical condition to make it up and back again. The weather can also turn wild, and groups are frequently turned back halfway up. But for those who make it, the thrill of climbing to the top of the highest point in Washington State is well worth the views and excitement of just being there.","August 5, 2014",A Challenging Climb,124,"Bellingham, WA",5
Mount Rainier,"Mount Rainier is simply amazing. We aren't hikers, but we took a little walk up a path as far as we could. The snow put a stop to our travels. The kids were amazed to find snow in July and we couldn't believe the beauty of the mountain and the glaciers.Paradise is very busy in the high months and on weekends. We had a very hard time finding parking despite having reservations at the Paradise Inn.

Mount Rainier,"We visited Mount Rainier National Park on Saturday, July 12, 2014. It costs $15 (per car) to access the park. Keep your receipt, as it’s valid for 7 days. We were told the best views of the mountain were from Paradise, so that is where we headed. The drive to Paradise was filled with beautiful scenery. There were a few pull-offs which provided gorgeous views of Mount Rainier. Once we arrived at Paradise (the name says it all), we stopped at the Visitors Center. We checked out the cafeteria and restrooms. After grabbing a Pepsi (yes – they serve Pepsi in Paradise!!), we headed for the mountain. There is a paved trail that starts near the Visitors center and goes up to Myrtle Falls. The paved part may go further than that, but there was too much snow to know for sure where the trail ended. Even in July, there is still snow on parts of the trail. We hadn't planned for the snow, so the walk was a bit slippery in parts with just our old tennis shoes. The snow reminded me of man made snow - very wet and icy. We walked to Myrtle Falls, which is scenic and peaceful. Except for the snow, the walk was pretty easy. Even though there was snow on the ground, the air temperature was great and even in shorts and a short sleeved shirt, we weren't cold at all. It’s hard to explain the natural beauty of this place…it is breathtaking. Driving down from Paradise, we drove over a bridge, which was built over the Nisqually River (which was created by the Nisqually Glacier). You can see the moraine, which are piles of loose & broken rock which have been carried along by glaciers and left in position as the glacier retreated.You could spend an hour or days here, depending on what you want to do. In any event, don’t miss Paradise.","August 5, 2014",Breathtaking!,245,"Aldie, Virginia",5
Mount Rainier,"We had a days spare before our cruise from Seattle so thought we'd go and drive out to Mount Rainier. It was well worth it.

Mount Rainier,"A week before visiting Mt. Rainier, had been out to Crater Lake. Unfortunately, it was cold, wet, and extremely foggy. When traveling, the day is planned, but the weather doesn't always cooperate. The day visiting Mt. Rainier was so appreciated after the Crater Lake experience. I wrote in my journal, the day was so perfect, there were moments at some of the view points that I thought this is what Heaven must be like. The air is so clear up there and the view is so majestic, even the smell of the great pines everywhere stays forever in your mind. What also is nice about Mt. Rainier National Park is that if you don't have a lot of time, just an afternoon can bring a satisfying experience in a short amount of time. Other National Parks take a lot more time to get a decent visit in. There are so many good viewing stops, and so many are not overly crowded that a great feeling for the love of nature is easily achieved here. If you haven't visited Mt. Rainier, make it happen. You will keep some great visual memories.

Mount Rainier,"We decided to take an adventure today to Mt Rainier. After checking out all the various tours , we decided to save money and do it ourselves. Easy!!! we rented a car mid size from Enterprise Westlake Downtown seattle for the day using AAA a tax $100 including gas. We upgraded for $20 to a jeep with a roof that comes off so we could have a more fun trip And what a bonus with great camera shots!!! The drive was gorgeous and easy to navigate. The ride was 87 miles about three hours with vista stops along the way. We went to the Sunrise side it was clean empty stunning. The admission for the car was $15 We hiked for four hours and really loved the whole experience. The price was over $100 cheaper for my family of four than doing it with a tour group. We didn't have hiking apparel just sneakers but managed to hike without problem! Several suggestions bring mosquito spray and sunblock.

Mount Rainier,"We must have visited The Mountain over twenty times in twenty years and it never gets old. We went to the Paradise Side (south). We had gone to the Sunrise side (north face) once and have never gone back. We made a spur of the moment decision and left our home, north of Seattle, on Sunday morning at 6:30 am. It was a leisurely drive in light traffic and took just under three hours. The summer construction project was not an issue, they aren’t working on the weekends. At 9:15, there was ample parking at Paradise and we hit the trailhead at 9:30. The destination was the face of the Muir snowfield above Pebble Creek, which took just over two hours. After a lunch break and one butt slide down the snow chutes, it was time for a one-hour hike down to the parking lot. By 1:00 pm, the lower fields and visitor center was packed with day tourists. There was no cloud cover and The Mountain was out in all her majesty and the temperature was perfect. Unfortunately, I saw many visitors who were wearing flip flops, sandals or a variety of the wrong kind of walking/jogging shoes and were definitely not enjoying themselves. The snow never melts on Rainier it does get sloshy at lower the levels! In mid July, ten minutes from the trailhead, you will be walking through snowfields, the “trail” is covered. Get a waterproof/goretex hiking shoe and enjoy yourself. Also, if you want to go the Panoramic Ridge or higher, rent a pair of trekking poles per person and don’t share, it makes a huge difference. Needless, to say, you need water, sunscreen, chapstick and a hat. The sun can be brutal even on the snow pack with a moderate temperature.

Mount Rainier,"Came here for a few days in June with my husband. The roads and trails were closed at about 5500 ft elevation due to snow. Out of the three days we were here, two were cloudy and we had very little visibility. Paradise was completely socked in, but it is a very nice visitor center. The last day however was a completely different story....the sun was out and we had the most spectacular views imaginable. Mount Rainier was so clear, it could almost make you cry. The hikes we went on were Carter Falls (about a mile and a half round trip, gradual incline to the falls, probably 2 hours spent hiking and taking pictures), Glacier View (stunning views with somewhat steep incline...too snowy to complete the hike) and Lake George (new most favorite hike I have ever been on- 8/8.5 miles round trip, first 3.5 miles is an easy to hike gravel road with some incline, but not enough to break a sweat really. Once off the road and onto the dirt trail, it is steep in places but the reward is completely worth it. Lake George is simply stunning). So many photo opportunities, its pathetic. We stayed at Deep Forest Cabins and it could not have been a more pleasant stay. If going to Mount Rainier to hike, wear layers, bring sunscreen (you can freeze and get sunburned in the same day) and bring a map! I would also recommend the book: Day Hike!

You can get close based on the season of the year, but if you get what you plan, you are lucky. We visited beautiful Mt Rainier NP, but never saw the mountain. The cloud cover produced an extremely low ceiling. We could almost touch the sky. Fortunately the visitor center is well done. Great overview movie and informative story boards. The Rangers are courteous and helpful. We drove to Reflection Lake and found it appropriately frozen over. The grove of Patriarch Trees was worth the walk in the woods and totally amazing.

Mount Rainier,"Ascending to 14,410 feet above sea level, Mount Rainier stands as an icon in the Washington landscape. An active volcano, Mount Rainier is the most glaciated peak in the contiguous U.S.A., spawning six major rivers. Subalpine wildflower meadows ring the icy volcano while ancient forest cloaks Mount Rainier’s lower slopes. Wildlife abounds in the park’s ecosystems. A lifetime of discovery awaits.Mount Rainier has five developed areas: Longmire, Paradise, Ohanapecosh, Sunrise, and Carbon/Mowich. Although the level of development in these areas ranges from basic -little more than a campground and picnic area- to extensive -hotel, restaurant, visitor center, campgrounds and picnic areas- each can serve as a base for exploring the rest of the park. July and August are generally sunny and mild, with the chance of showers. The rest of the year is usually quite rainy, with heavy snowfall from November through April. Raingear is recommended year round. Trails are steep and well maintained in summer and snow covered and difficult to follow in winter.","July 6, 2014",Lucky to see this view every morning on my way to work!,256,"Chehalis, Washington",5

Mount Rainier,"Mt. Rainier is a lovely national park, with lots of waterfalls, and a variety of walking trails from easy to professional mountain climber abilities. Many of the waterfalls are close to the road, so that persons with disabilities (such as my mom, who I traveled with and is on a walker) could get out and enjoy them and look at them. There were actually also a lot of wildflowers in bloom which was really nice. We actually were in the park in late June (24th and 25th), and at that time some of the most famous meadows were still snow covered (and some roads closed) and the reflection lakes were still icebound, which was kind of surprising. It would have been nice to see more wildlife, I talked to a ranger and he said a lot of the bigger animals were still up in the snow closed areas at that time of year, which is on the Eastern side of the park. (We basically stuck to the Southern side). Some road construction along the Nisqually entrance, at least for a while.

We were among the lucky ones to catch Rainier on a clear day (for at least half the day) and we were able to stop for pictures of the mountains, vivid wildflowers, waterfalls, and (at the top of the mountain) snow. Everywhere we turned was nature's beauty. We went on a Monday, so the crowds weren't bad. They didn't have Paradise Road open yet, but you could reach the visitor's center, which is worth a stop. Reflection Lake was ice and snow covered, so not much reflecting going on - but it was still gorgeous. Grove of the Patriarchs was a nice hike and we especially liked the swinging bridge over the river (note the trail is not handicapped accessible as there are about 50 steps or so one-way and the narrower bridge to traverse). There are flush toilet restrooms at nearly every major trailhead, which are appreciated. Pack a lunch (or dinner) and spend the day because it's worth it. We drove in through the Paradise entrance and left through the Stevens Canyon area, which was super nice and even less busy. The park rangers are also super friendly and helpful.

Mount Rainier,"Marge and I drove up from the Columbia Gorge this morning Thursday 5 June 2014 for a 2 day stay. The weather was glorious with no clouds. You could see Mt. St. Helen, Mt. Hood, Mt. Adams, and Mt. Rainier, We came in from the East though Yakima and Packwood. Stopped at the Stevens Canyon entrance and paid our 15 dollars. Saw and walked the Grove of the Patriarchs and the island in the Ohanapecosh river. Got to see where the lahar in 2006 took out the roads, buildings, electric and closed this part of the park for 6 months. Continued up Rt. 123 to Cayuse and Chinook Passes. They had just opened. Stopped and built a snowman and threw a few snowballs. Tried to get to sunrise but the road was closed. Drove back down and got to Stevens Canyon, Stevens Creek, the Box Canton and did the Canyon Stroll. Snow lake and Bench lakes were frozen and buried under 10 feet of snow. Reflection lake was still frozen and snow covered ( 95% of it). Many of the trails were still packed with snow and ice. Nisqually vista trail required snowshoes and 2.5 hours of travel time as the path was buried 12 ft. and the direction markers were difficult to follow. At the Henry M. Jackson memorial Visitors center Marge started her climb to the top (see the picture). Narada fall was so neat seeing all that water and force. Camera got sprayed. The Tatoosh Range which are remains of lava flowws about 25 million years before Rainier shows up provide dramatic scenery. The Lngmire Museum was closed for 1 week due to training. we did walk the Trail of Shadows. Saw where the Kautz creek flooded the area in 1947. Check out the wide creek bed, dead trees, debris etc. Sunshine point is the remains of a camp that was wiped out in I believe 2006 as the area received 18 inches of rain in 36 hours. The only horrible thing was staying at the gateway Inn in cabin # 3.

There are many roads which you can drive to see the wonders of this great mountain. One of the places to definitely stop at one your travels around the mountain is Reflection Lake. Spectacular, as you can see the reflection of the mountain in the lake (on a good day at least). Trouble is that it is difficult to get that whole scene into the viewfinder of your camera.

Mount Rainier,"My husband, Trevor and I enjoyed our guided tour of Mt Rainier National Park with EverGreen Escapes Seattle Day Tours, 2960 4th Ave South Seattle, WA 98134, on Saturday 17 May 2014. The weather was glorious with some cloud but not enough to obscure the view of Mt Rainier itself. Our two guides were very helpful and friendly they walked at our pace and took us only on walking tracks that we could manage at our age and level of fitness [we are in our seventies]. We saw wildflowers as well as huge trees, we even saw and heard a woodpecker knocking on a tree and coming from Australia it was a rare sight indeed.

Mount Rainier,"In Seattle for a few days and after seeing Mt Rainier coming in from airport we added it to our list. Took approx 2.5 hour leisurely drive (even though it looks so close you could touch it) from Seattle to Paradise where the highest visitor center is located. The weather was partly cloudy with the summit visible for short periods from time to time. This was mid-June temps in the 60's. Beautiful drive up with magnificent forest with lot of elk and deer visible to the keen eyed, even during mid-day. Once you enter the park, the old growth forest with great grandfather fir trees as wide as a car just blew us away...150 foot straight old growth...you have to see it to appreciate it. I though it was more impressive than Sequoia National forest in northern kalifornia(intentional). The drive up was equal to the views when we arrived. We left Seattle around 8am and got back about 5pm after a leisurely lunch in a Hobo restaurant/hotel/museum in Elbe. Also worth the stop! Dined in 1930's rail car with varied menu and reasonable prices (elk burger, blue cheese burger, huge garden salad all recommended. We got fresh picked Washington cherries for $1.00 a basket the road.Hint: Don't take this trip on a rainy or overcast day.

We did end up going to some of the lower elevation trails, and saw the beautiful Carter waterfall.The drive is stunning and I recommend taking your time to see as much as you can. One word of warning, do NOT eat at the Jackson visitor center at Paradise!!! I got the pot roast sandwich. The 'meat' if you can call it that was disgusting. It had a consistency more like spam or meatloaf, was cold and dry and I think the pot it was made in might taste better. And all that for a WAY too much money.

In Australia our highest mountain is half the height of Mt Rainier, and we were so privileged to visit it two days after a great snow dump that the incipient Spring hadn't even begun to thaw. Result? It was like a ""White Christmas"", but in brilliant sunshine and warmth, so much so that a lot of other visitors were getting about in T-shirts and flip-flops. Unfortunately there had been an absence of power, so the electric-operated exhibits in the National Park Visitor Center weren't operating, and the food on sale at their cafeteria was similarly restricted. But you go for the views and to experience nature at its majestic best, and, boy-o-boy!, does Mount Rainier National Park deliver! We had a perfect cloudless day with blue skies and views to die for.

The road was winding and continually rising but had some lovely view points along the way. The skiers, toboganist's,snow trekkers were all out in force and enjoying the conditions and the park was fairly busy. I was glad it was the off season as the place must be packed in spring/summer ?

The lakes and the forests are out of your dreams, stop on the way to look at the falls and creeks, Narada is worth a stop on its own. Get out of the car and walk over the dry riverbeds and get a feel for the nature, it's shouts glacier at you all over the place, the tumbled rocks of different colours and mineralogy are superb.You have a feeling that nature rules here, if you come in spring, summer or Autumn then we are fine, I would love to see it in the winter and a dream would be to bunk down for the worst months and see nature close by and I am sure that is when the wildlife will claim it all back for themselves.There is a charge of $15 per vehicle at entry to the park which lasts for a week and I think that next time we will spend an overnighter to get the best of the visit in between working weeks.The national park established in the late 1800's is a visionary surprise, ok nature does it all for you but the way the entry roads are engineered were made to give you the optimum in visual pleasure.Rainier itself can be illusive and some times the best view is from far away. You can hire snow shoes or ski up here but just go and appreciate a unique beauty of the cascades, a brooding volcanoe she looks down on us with her own pleasure, yet...Let us all admire, respect and preserve this beauty, we are only onlookers at what nature best provides, the raw beauty and infinite colours of the forest, the rocks and the sky and rivers and creeks add up to beyond more than words may express, it has its own poetry and will, let us hope that generations to come will appreciate what she gives for free.","April 13, 2014",Glorious views,81,"Stafford, United Kingdom",5

On our way to Seattle we could see Rainier from 80+ miles away. We instantly knew that we needed to visit the National Park and get up close and personal with this natural wonder.You'll find plenty of pullouts along the road way throughout the Park where you can enjoy various views of the mountain at its center, but as is almost always the case, getting out of the car and going for a hike can take your visit to a whole new level. There are hundreds of miles of trail to choose from, each offering a new and exhilarating view of the mountain and other incredible natural treasures.Some thing to remember though, depending on when you visit Mount Rainier you very well may find the mountain under thick cloud cover. This may be frustrating to some, however sometimes all you need to do is be patient, and give Rainier the chance to come out from hiding. Watching the mountain emerge dramatically from the clouds might be one of the most beautiful things you may ever see, and is definitely worth the wait.For Virtual Tours of Mt Rainier and other Must See destinations visit:https://www.youtube.com/user/AtHomeInWildPlaces","April 3, 2014",Awe-inspiring Mt Rainier,13,"Orem, Utah",5

It almost seemed unreal it was so massive and gorgeous. Once we passed through the main gates, we proceeded to head up to Paradise Visitor's Center. I think it was a 15 mile winding road, and all the along the way, we passed through thick, green forests and river valleys before finally arriving at Paradise. The mountain loomed overhead and we were planning on doing the hike to Camp Muir. The day we went was right at the end of June, and all the trails were completely snow-covered. We weren't entirely sure where the start of the trail was so we followed a group of mountaineers. We were not at all equipped to hike in the snow, but nevertheless, we made our way up. The views were incredible and at one point, we ran into a marmot and had fun watching the little critter scurry around. We reached the Muir Snowfield and the hike got really hard for us since we didn't have crampons, but following in the footsteps of the climbers with good footwear, we made it to Camp Muir! The hike back down went fast (like maybe a fraction of the time). This was mostly because we had a lot of fun sliding down the snow. At the end of the day, I was exhausted and sore, but thoroughly happy we did it.

One of my favorite things to do is hike upward from the Visitor Center to a point where with binoculars, I can follow climbers as they hike toward the summit. It's an amazing thing to watch. Another favorite is a stay at the historic lodge at Paradise. Rooms in the old lodge are small and quaint, but I love them. There is something special after the day visitors leave and the overnight guests migrate to either the lobby or the balcony to read, play a game or share a bottle of wine.

Mount Rainier,"Took the ranger led snowshoe walk from the Paradise Visiter Center on 12/24/13. The walk itself was magical but the female ranger was kind of sarcastic and impatient. Would recommend that you talk to ranger on duty before booking to be sure you don't get the one we got. The walk is about 1.5 miles in 2 hours. The visitor center will rent snowshoes but we had our own. It was supposed to be family friendly walk but the ranger veered off the normal trail and took a much more strenuous route. Not very fair of her and she was impatient with those who could not keep up. Would have given 5 stars if not for her. Otherwise, the scenery was spectacular and we are very glad we did this. Seemed like the elevation gain was around 500 feet but it could have been more since we weren't following the published trail. We got some awesome photos. The weather on the mountain changes constantly. Misty clouds would roll in and then be gone in a few minutes and the beautiful blue skies were back. When the sun was shining, the snow on the trees would melt and fall to the ground and roll down the mountain. We did the 11:15 am walk and there weren't many people there at that time. Be sure to check the park's twitter feed or website to be sure roads are open before you go. Beware the road out closes at 5:00 pm so you should plan to leave by 4:00 pm to be on the safe side.

Mount Rainier,"Listed about a couple hours from Seattle, this makes for a good weekend trip. The drive to the park is scenic. As you go up, the weather increasingly drops (esp. during fall and winter) - the site is soft, milky white almost. Lots to places to hike and see. The mountain itself is majestic and looks beautiful. Worth a trip.","December 16, 2013",Good weekend trip!!,120,,5
Mount Rainier,"This place is about 2.5 hrs away from Seattle - we went to the side of Nisqually entrance as all others were close due to winter. We took Paradise rd to get to the visitor center. The view from there of the mount rainier was great and this is a great ski spot. The gate is open from 9 and you should not cross Nisqually side entrance anytime after 230 pm to have enough time for you to return as the gate closes at 5 in winter. Check the park website for details. The drive is very scenic, prefer to have a four wheel drive car or a normal car with snow chain. If you enjoy scenic drive in forest and snow capped mountain this is the place to go. You can even do a day trip from Seattle.","December 15, 2013",Amazing view and excellent drive,137,"Greater London, United Kingdom",5
Mount Rainier,"Majestic. It's hard to beat the scenery here. The mountain is amazing with the snow caps and glaciers. The run off glacier water has a ""milky"" appearance and is cold. Naturally.

You have to be patient as the drive is lengthy but Mt. walker offers you different angles to capture its mighty image from various heights. Despite watching it from all along it will not fail to surprise you when you reach the top. Tip: Do plan food and water to much on your way.

Mount Rainier,"A spectacular mountain, and much more. While it's hard to pull your eyes away from the mountain, beautiful in October against a crystal blue sky, the lake, waterfalls and surprising rainforest area of the park were also wonderful.

Mount Rainier,"Anytime of the year you go here, the scenery is spectacular. I have visited in all four seasons. There is plenty to do, hiking, picnicking in summer and skiing, tubing and snowboarding in the fall/winter. They were doing just that when I visited in November 2013. Even the waterfalls are spectacular. Expect crowds during the summer and weekends. The visitor center at Paradise is ok, but I am a little biased as I remember the round visitors center from years ago.During the summer you can visit the eastern side of Mt. Rainier (Sunrise). You can always visit Lake Tipsoo and Ohanapecosh without paying the fees when the roads are open.Beautiful scenery no wonder it is a national park.","November 11, 2013",Natural wonder,136,"Kent, Washington",5
Mount Rainier,"Spent a week with our local hiking club on a number of trails in the Mt Rainier Park. In August, there are still abundent flowers on many of the trails. Particularly recommended is the Naccus Loop trail...stunning views and literally millions of flowers. Trails are well marked and with a wide range of difficulty from easy to challenging. We have lived with three hours driving distance (in Oregon) for decades and it was our first real visit.....it will not be our last.","October 30, 2013",A great week of hiking,24,Oregon,5
Mount Rainier,"I had the opportunity to visit Seattle in June 2013, and took advantage of a full-day tour offered by Seattle Tours. For about $100, I traveled in a van with five other tours through the lush green Washington countryside to and through the park. I'm usually skeptical about tours because I had a bad and a mediocre tour in Portland, OR, a few years back, and I'm careful with spending only for things worthwhile.The driver was a few minutes late, but everything after that was fine and dandy. We stopped off at Puyallup for some lunch supplies as we knew food would be more expensive and not as readily available on the mountain. The driver stopped briefly at several spots along the way so we could whet out appetites for the towering view of Mt. Rainier as we drew closer.When we arrived at the entrance, which was heavily forested, I wasn't exactly sure that there would be much to see other than woods. But as we winded through the long paved roads, we came to a clearing and saw the mountain in most of its full glory. (Mountains are often shrouded in cloud cover; the bigger they are, the more there is.) But the driver knew just where to stop for the best views.I'm very energetic so I'd often jump out of the van at a stop and wander as far as I could in view of the time we had. So many choices for trails and views that I felt disappointed that I couldn't stay longer. When we got the visitor's center, there was snow everywhere. I dipped my hand into a stream leading from the mountain and it almost numbed me ... in June! Mountains are weathermakers unto themselves and the closer we got, the less we saw of it. But it was cool walking on snow in June since I'm from Pennsylvania.Grove of the Patriarchs. Do not miss it! Especially the shaky wood slat bridge over a roaring brook that many are afraid to cross. The trees are immense, and the scent is like being in a cedar closet. There are signs near every type of tree explaining what it is. And there are strategically placed benches so you can get great photo opps near the best trees.Marijuana is legal in Washington, so I was surprised to see a drug bust of an obviously stoned young couple by a park ranger. Certainly another highlight!All in all, Mt. Rainier is not to be missed if you're in the northwest. It takes you away from the hustle and bustle of Seattle, which is only about 90 miles away. Not bad. Go for it!","October 29, 2013",Mt. Rainier National Park - Not so rainy,73,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5

Mount Rainier,"We visited this national park in mid-September, and it was cold. First, be sure your gas tank is full before entering the park. There are long distances to drive in the park and no gas. On this road trip I allowed two days in each place because I knew that it can be rainy in the Northwest! This turned out to be a good strategy. Day one at Rainier was cold and rainy. We drove to Sunrise in pouring rain hoping the weather would change, but no luck. There was also thick fog. The second day we woke to more fog, and began to lose hope of seeing Mount Rainier. We hiked in The Grove of the Patriarchs, an old growth forest, which was awe inspiring. We hiked the Bench Lake and Snow Lake trail, and then left the park to get gas. On our way back into the park we stopped for a late lunch at Longmire. The fog lifted, the clouds parted, and there was Mount Rainier. We sat for two or three hours on the porch steps at Longmire staring at it and taking pictures. It became more beautiful as the sun began to go down. We had been told that Mount Rainier was the most re-visited national park because so many people come and never see the mountain!We saw beautiful waterfalls on our way into the park's Nisqually entrance.We stayed at the Paradise Inn, which I gave a poor review, and now wish I could amend it. I would not want anyone to not stay there because of my review. For one thing it is inside the park, which for me is always a huge advantage. For another thing there is the rustic charm of the lobby in the evening. I loved the huge fireplaces, and the absence of TV's! Also forget about cell phone service and internet. Enjoy the quiet.","October 18, 2013",We finally got to see it!,107,"Madison, Alabama",5
Mount Rainier,We stopped by here as a week long trip involving Olympic National Park and Seattle. The best part was definitely Mount Rainier National Park. We went in late June/early July and there was still a lot of snow at Rainier. We got to walk up the trails up the mountain and had a lot of fun. We were blessed by great weather and there was definitely a lot of things to see there.,"October 17, 2013",Great National Park - and a must if visiting Seattle,6,"Ridgewood, New York",5
Mount Rainier,"We visited Sunrise Visitor Center on a weekday in September so none of the facilities (except restrooms) were open, but who needs facilities when you are surrounded by such breathtaking natural beauty. The parking lot was quite empty and it was very peaceful. The drive up to the parking lot (located 6400 ft above sea level) was through thick forest most of the way, with occasional glimpses of the surrounding mountains and valleys. The roads are very good with barriers and low walls to prevent accidents, and as we ascended we saw increasing amounts of snow in the meadows and on the trees (but not on the road surface) which just added to the magic.The view from the top is stunning. It's quite amazing that from 6400 ft the mountain towers another 8000 feet above you. Don't be put off because the weather doesn't look promising at lower elevations. When we left Randle to the south steady rain was falling, the sky was completely grey and the cloud level was skirting the treetops. The sides of the valley were not visible at all, but as we approached the mountain and climbed the heavy clouds drifted away and the sun started breaking through. It wasn't long before we were basking in sunshine under a bright blue sky. The mountain itself was partially obscured by billowing clouds some of the time, but occasionally the whole summit and environs would come into view, and what an immense and stunning vista it is - glaciers, towering summit, thick year round snow pack, craggy peaks in all directions. We just ate our picnic then sat and stared for a long time.Remember to take a jacket! It's cold up there....On the way down most of the fog and low clouds had dissipated from even the lower slopes and the views from the road and various parking areas was wonderful - snow capped peaks rising above sweeping deep verdant tree filled valleys. Lovely.Next time I'm in the area I'll visit other areas in the National Park, but I'll always remember and look back on Sunrise with very fond memories.","October 16, 2013","Beautiful, Immense, Breathtaking",63,"Cleveland, Ohio",5

Somehow I though I was in better shape this time but I realize much of the credit goes to the people who take care of the trails. They have made ""stairs"" out of flatter rocks so the ascent and descent could be safer. I did not slip on any rocks because they were stable. Great! There are a lot of people on this trail,and so the trail is paved for quite a distance. This is hard on feet with hiking boots but I know it is done to keep people OFF the alpine vegetation. Of course I did see people sitting up there in the meadow anyway, there are always idiots!

Mount Rainier,"Mount Rainier is a day trip from Seattle but it is a full day with lots of driving. It is definitely worth the drive because the scenery is awesome. In Rainier we saw Narada fall, Myrtle falls, walked the Grove of the Patriarchs trail, drove the Stevens Canyon rode, Paradise visitor center. Once you get t the center the mountain is right there in your face. with its many glaciers shimmering in the sunlight. We took the trail to Myrtle falls and got a picture of the falls with the majestic mountain in the background. The Grove of the Patriarchs hike was my favorite of the day. It is a short hike on a well maintained trail though old growth forests. The trees are massive here. They have a placard on two trees dating the trees at over 1000 years old. That would be year 1013 - over 450 years old before Columbus discovered America. There is another tree that is so wide we took a picture of me with my arms opened wide to my sides and you could still see tree trunk on both sides - and I am 6ft tall.The Stevens Canyon road was an awesome drive if you have never driven a mountain road before. There a steep drop offs on one side of the road and a steep mountain cliffs on the other side.Parking is an issue at Paradise. Like I said we went in September after the kids went back to school and it was difficult to find a parking spot.

Therefore, it was nice to be able to go back there and actually look at it on a nice day. You have to pay to get in and then the group I was with went to the main visitor center at Paradise Lodge. From there you can check out the visitor center, grab a bite to eat and then walk up the trail as far as you want. Most people go up to the Glacier Vista viewpoint before heading back down. You have a chance to see different types of wildlife such as marmots, deer and bears. You can also visit with other visitors and see what they have to say about their trip. There is also a marker that says the 10th Mountain Division trained there before being sent to Italy for combat in World War 2. Dress for the weather because it can change there.

Numerous hiking trails some crowded, some quiet. Nisqually vista trail offered good mountain and glacier views and was very easy.

Enormous meadows of flowers, snow and glaciers, deer prancing, rabbits running, and marmots scurrying in the scenery. Forewarning: once you've been to Mt. Rainier all other hikes are less than spectacular! The Skyline trail is strenuous but preteens can do it, as long as you give them the time to stop and rest (you want to take pictures anyway!). They were capable of doing it. The amount of time it took our family, from start to finish, was 4 hours. Advise: Start Skyline closest to the vistors center side and end at the Paradise Inn side.

We started at the north side of the park and worked our way down the east side, stopping at Sunrise, and then around to the south to Paradise. Can't really make good driving time in the mountains so prepared for this to be a full day. The wildflower fragrance from the meadows at Paradise and the waterfalls were spectacular. So peaceful & visually stunning; always find myself breathing slower whenever I'm in the mountains.

Mount Rainier,"Amazing! Enormous snow covered mountain, full of glaciers, waterfalls, and valleys exploding with colorful wildflowers. Plus, there is wildlife everywhere. We saw deer, marmot, little chipmunks, spruce grouse and tons of other birds. We didn't see any black bears though. We saw the entire mountain while driving up to Paradise, and had some great views of the mountain and Paradise River. By the time we got to Paradise clouds and fog were rolling in and we could not view the upper portion of the mountain for the rest of our stay. I guess it's not uncommon for some visitors to not have a chance to view the mountain. I'm thankful I did.Not to worry, because there is a lot more to see than the mountain. We hiked the Skyline Trail and the Nisqually Trail, and other trails near the Paradise Inn, all which were filled with wildflowers and wildlife. There are awesome waterfalls all over mountain- there is snowmelt all year round. We hiked up to where the Muir Snowfield begins and had lunch by Pebble Creek. It was worth the hike!This area is beautiful. Unfortunately, we were only there for one day. I definitely hope to return again for a longer visit to spend more time at Paradise and check out the rest of the park. I think you can easily spend a week or more at Mt. Rainier. The one major downside with a park this great is the crowds. We were there on a Sunday in the summer, so we knew it was gonna be crowded, but it was jam packed. I believe the Paradise area may be the busiest part of the park, so there may be some good spots to escape the crowds.

Mount Rainier,"This is a park that should be on everyone's list to visit. It is my understanding that it is the first national park that had a 'development plan' and it shows: the visitor center is among the best I've ever seen, with interactive displays, movies and artifacts of all kinds; the road winding through the park was designed to surprise you with amazing vistas from lookout points; the trails accommodate all manner of walkers (it ranges from simple trails around the visitor center, wheelchair accessible, to the Wanderland trail that is 93 miles long, rounds Mount Rainier and takes about 7-10 days to walk, for the ones serious about it!). If you're a serious climber, you can attempt Mount Rainier itself.The scale of the mountain range is amazing and, if you're lucky enough to catch sight of Mount Rainier itself, it'll leave you speechless. We spent two days there and got glimpses of it, as it is often shrouded in clouds. Well worth it though.

But if your day is on the rainy or cloudy side, there is still plenty to see. Take a tour of the waterfalls on the way up to Paradise. Stop at the Nisqually River bridge and watch the river run. If you are lucky enough to be there after a rain storm up on the mountain, check out the weird fog along the river beg - there is a picture included.

Almost all the information is at the west end entrance, although maps are available at the southeast entrance.

We had beautiful weather,super clear day, just right temperatures. We were lucky enough to find a place to park in the lower lot. It gets full quickly, so get there early! Stopped in at the Visitors Center first to get some ideas. Friendly rangers there. Took a short hike to Myrtle Falls. Absolutely beautiful. Easy walk. We also hiked up the Skyline Trail for awhile, but knew we wouldn't have enough time to hike the whole thing. We also hiked the Nisqually Vista Trail which begins at the lower parking lot. We headed out in the morning on this hike and saw 2 deer on our walk! They were very curious about us and it was fun watching them. Definitely walk this easy trail! It brings you over to the Nisqually glacier...amazing!We ate at the little cafe they have inside. If you can bring your own food...do it!

We took a hike up the trail and it was not long before we encountered snow in July along with early spring blooms along the trail. Photo ops were non-stop and alternative trails were ultimately the decision once the snow became too heavy. The other trails were just as beautiful and the views unmatched. About 3 hours of hiking around was plenty and given many stops to take photos, it was an excellent experience. If I were to return to attempt to go up the mountain, I would schedule it later in the season near early September when more of the snow is melted up the trail and I hear far more wild flowers are in bloom.","August 2, 2013",Stunning,24,"Cedarburg, Wisconsin",5

Maybe we weren't taking the right road or not reading the signs correctly but by the time we reached Paradise, where I had planned for us to eat lunch, they were closed. So we returned to Longmire, went in, were seated after a long wait, then had to flag down a waiter to take our order, even thought there was only two other tables occupied. At last he took our order and we waited some more. Finally after waiting nearly 20 minutes for a couple sandwiches I got up and looked into what I thought was the kitchen, NO KITCHEN. I don't have any idea where they had to go to make the food, back to Paradise, I suppose, but anyway that was enough so we left.The scenes that we found looking for a place to eat were gorgeous, but they certainly need to take some lessons in taking care of customers if they want people to come and stay in this beautiful land that ""belongs to all of us.""","August 1, 2013",Spectacular!,195,Oklahoma,4

At the Paradise Inn and Visitor Center the facilities leave a little to be desired. The so-called museum is very limited. At the Inn the rooms are strictly for those with rustic tastes and the brunch buffet is disorganized and mediocre.

Mount Rainier,"I have seen a good many volcanoes over the last thirty years but this one ranks as one of the best volcano experiences I have had, anywhwere. Some reasons why this occasion was so special:1. We had mostly clear weather when we visited so we saw the glaciated cone to its best advantage, especially alongside the mass of radiant wild flowers in the Alpine fields (I hear July and August are good months to visit for this type of weather and color).2. The national park was easy to access. We drove up from Longview, WA, just north of Portland, OR, and it took slightly more than two hours to get there. I imagine it would be about three hours from Portland, which is still a manageable day trip if you leave early enough.3. The scenery en route, especially once you enter the national park area, is stunning, particularly the deep, heavily-glaciated gorges that flank the lower reaches of Mount Rainier.4. Paradise (on the south side) offers many opportunities to get right up against the slopes of the volcano. Indeed, we hiked the Alta Vista trail (in July) and got right next to a large snow field the went right up to one of the glaciers.5. Paradise's national park visitors center is one of the best I have seen - anywhere in the world - with lots of exhibits and models, a fascinating full-screen movie experience and a host of helpful rangers to point you in the right direction.6. There is so much more to do in this park than to just gaze on or hike the volcano. This is one of America's larger national parks and around 97% of it is wilderness, so the outdoor opportunities appear to be endless (I particularly like the idea of the 97-mile hiking circuit around Mount Rainier).I have waited many years to visit Mount Rainier, and I feel so blessed that the stars aligned for our particular visit.

Mount Rainier,"This July was awesome. if you have not been to Rainier this year go as soon as you can because the wildflowers are in full bloom and no snow. The weather is great and there are many hikes to take with little ones. The drive to Paradise is more gridlock than the freeway on weekends- if Paradise is your destination avoid weekends. Trying to find parking and the crowds really diminishes the whole ""peaceful"" hike experience. I recommend going to Sunrise if you are going on a weekend. It is less crowded and the view of Rainier and the meadows are more awesome than at Paradise. there are relatively easy hikes which provide awesome views Rainier that should not be missed. Go up to the left first and come down with the view of Rainier. The bonus, if you are coming from the Seattle area, it is closer than Paradise. If you are going to Paradise, stop to hike the water bridge before going up. I forgot the name, ask the rangers. It is a riverbed with precarious yet safe bridge that is fun to walk across. My little one loves it! If you are doing the Jr. Ranger program, stop at Longmire ranger station to pick up the booklet. By the time you get to Sunrise you will be finished.

Mount Rainier,"Towering over most of western Washington State, Mt. Rainier is an awesome place. Even in early July, many of the novice trails are covered in snow but there is beauty everywhere. As for viewing the mountain there are really three outstanding spots. Most obvious is Paradise with its alpine meadows covered in wildflowers, the historic Paradise Inn and its hiking center for really serious hikers/mountain climbers. Also worthwhile (but a long drive (in and out) is Sunrise.(Try and get to either location early as on weekends the parking lots fill up and you can be turned back for lack of space.) Both locations offer short walks/hikes for the novice to get wonderful vistas of the mountain and surrounding alpine like environs. The third recommended ""hidden gem"" is actually outside the park at the Crystal Mountain Ski Area (near the Sunrise road entrance). Here a new gondola brings you up over 6,000 feet to a wonderful restaurant and terrace were you can get what I think is the most beautiful view of the wonders of Mt. Rainier and the surrounding areas and have some good food and drink. Also worthy of mention is an easy but beautiful walk through the Grove of the Patriarchs (an old growth forest). As for accommodations immediately adjacent the park, be forewarned, they are ""rustic"" at best. You can do the entire loop around Mt. Rainier in wonderfully rewarding one day trip but I'd strongly recommend brand lodging a short drive from the park. (Don't count on the online ratings of accommodations in Ashford or other locations immediately adjacent the entrances).","July 14, 2013","Majestic, dramatic and crowded on weekends",14,Los Angeles,5
Mount Rainier,"We visited Mount Rainier in August 2012 and after reading some reviews, we decided to hike the Sunrise Trail. The drive up to the trail head was beautiful (as was the drive back down!). There is plenty of parking at the trail head and there were lots of people on the trail (not too many, but not just a few either). The hikers were of all ages so there were times when we did just quickly go around others while hiking. There are a few steep inclines on the trail so just know that going into the trail. We brought our trekking poles and I'm glad we did. There were also several areas with loose walk along the trail. We didn't hike the whole trail, but enough of it to get a great workout! The weather was wonderful! Definitely go on this trail if you're looking for a nice hike!","July 14, 2013",Great hiking!,78,"Nashville, Tennessee",5
Mount Rainier,"I've traveled to Mt Rainier many times over the past 25+ years, and have experienced The Mountain many ways. There is something for everyone on Mt Rainier.Rainier is a massive volcano, and the most glaciated mountain in the lower 48 states of the US. It receives huge amounts of snow, and generally has snow at or near the Paradise visitors area well into July.Both the Paradise and Sunrise visitor centers are worth visiting, but perhaps not in a single day. Driving up to, say 5,000 ft, is not all that one should do on Rainier. Go for a short walk or long hike, as your time and health permit. You do not have to get too far away from the parking lots to start appreciating the majesty and beauty of Mt Rainier.Climbing to the summit of Mt Rainier is a great experience, but one that requires training and planning. This is not a mountain to be taken lightly. The terrain and weather can be harsh, and people do die hiking and climbing on Rainier. On the other hand, with proper assistance, climbing Rainier can be immensely rewarding. There are excellent guide services, like Rainier Mountaineering (RMI) out of Ashford, WA who regularly lead summit climbs. A visit to their website (www.rmiguides.com) will give the interested reader a good idea of how and where to start if they want to consider a summit climb.Whether you driving around the mountain, stopping at vistas and visitor centers, or climbing to the summit, Mt Rainier is must-visit destination.","July 14, 2013","An Amazing Mountain, With Something for Everyone",98,"Atlanta, Georgia",5

Mount Rainier,"Just back from summiting Mt. Rainier with International Mountain Guides (IMG), one of three guide services on the mountain. Climbed it 18 years ago with Rainier Mountaineering Inc (RMI) and had a great experience, but in doing some research appreciated the itinerary and little extras that come with the IMG experience. First day we climbed to Camp Muir and stayed in the hut there. Day 2 was skills school in the morning (learning climbing steps, how to be roped together, crampon and ice ax use, etc.) and then climb up to the tents at Ingraham Flats at about 11,400 feet. Day 3 up very early (2 a.m.) to the summit and then all the way back down to Paradise. Two nights on the mountain vs. one with RMI, which was much better to acclimatize and climb the mountain at a more ""humane"" pace. The kicker, though, was IMG's food. We brought our own lunches and snacks, but our guides prepared breakfasts and dinners, which were outstanding. RMI will heat water only for food. A little extra $$ for IMG, but well worth it. And we found the guides to be extremely competent and friendly. IMG was launched some years ago by three veteran RMI guides who know how to run this business. Climbing Mt. Rainier is tough...no doubt about it. You have to be in the best shape of your life. But, the bottom line is, you can do it. There are no technical skills needed, but you must put in the time to train properly. We got lucky with the weather for early June. Sunny throughout our climb. It was cold and windy on the upper mountain, but that's to be expected. The views were spectacular and we were blessed with a great group of eight climbers and four guides.

That is worth a stop to see and smell the miles of gorgeous apple trees and packing houses, as well as the pretty town of Yakima. It is not a long drive up the mountain roads into the Rainier Park, seeing clean streams, wildflowers, and evergreens to drive to the top of the viewing area for the best sight of enormous, majestic Mt. Rainier. There is a pullout and bathrooms just before the road levels out with a lake and meadow of yellow and blue flowers as far as you can see. In the near distance the icy top of Mt. Rainier with its many glaciers is framed by the forest in a spot that offers parking and photos. We are not hikers, but some hardy types can be seen taking the steep trails over to the mountain, however, for us, the picture postcard view of Mt. Rainier was enough.

How to get there is not easily found if you do not have a map. The car rental companies do not have maps! So we bought a Washington state map at a gas station. We took from the Seattle airport area highway 169 to 410 which is eastbound. 410 turns into 123 east side of park. We took the Paradise park entrance and then followed that highway. After leaving the Paradise park area the road turns to highway 706 to highway 7 which goes back to Tacoma etc. We had our national park pass so entrance fee was free. Our drive was in late May so snow was on the mountains and melting. Seeing lots of waterfalls along the way. Beautiful views. Due to cloud cover not able to see all the mountain, but well worth the drive. Over all trip will take a good part of your day so start early. We started late morning and we drove it in 5-6 hours but the next time we would allow more time. When we talked to the local people they said ""you can't see the mountain,"" discouraging us from driving out to the park. But for us who live in the flat lands of the midwest it was a thrill to see snow covered mountains, huge pine trees, waterfalls, etc. They say: ""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" and we were not disappointed in the beauty!

One, the closer one, was right outside but unmarked. He said that it was an easier hike and shorter. We just had to follow where other people walked. The snow was pretty trampled and it was hard to see where to go. We decided to try the other one.The second one was, well . . . It was marked - there were snow poles every 30 or so feet.

Mount Rainier,"I’m not sure if Trip Advisor will publish this review since it reflects a not-so-recent-visit to Mt. Rainier. However, I did recently visit my 100th national park, and I took the opportunity to make a list of my favorites. After a lot of recollection and reflection, I decided that Mt. Rainier is my favorite national park.I first visited Mt. Rainier in 1963 with my parents on our last family trip together before I left home for college that fall. During that visit, I stupidly tried to climb to the top of Mt. Rainier, but didn’t have a clue as to what was entailed. I made it up part of the Muir Snowfield, before I turned back. I have since returned to the park on two other occasions with my wife and daughter. Our most recent visit was 1997. Hence my reservations about getting published by Trip Advisor some 16 years later. However, my guess is, the mountain is still there, the Paradise Lodge is still there, and Mt. Rainier is still the most magnificent sight in the contiguous 48 states. In 1997, I spent four days at the Paradise Lodge with my wife and at the time, 11 year old daughter. Back then, reservations were hard to get, and the lodge was pretty rustic, but we loved it. I doubt if much has changed. The purpose of our visit was sightseeing for the girls, and for me to climb the mountain, guided by Rainier Mountaineering Inc. (RMI). At that time, RMI pretty much had a monopoly on guiding climbs up the mountain. My experience with RMI was 10 on a scale of 10, and I was fortunate enough to make it to the true summit of Mt. Rainier, led by famed Everest climber Dave Hahn. That experience will remain one of the highlights of my life.One thing that stands out from our visit was that every visitor should make a point of driving to the north side of the mountain to view it from the Sunrise Visitor center area. I think that the view from that side is even more spectacular than it is from the south in Paradise. My family and I hiked a trail or two there, and the views from the trails were truly breathtaking (not to be confused with the Seinfeld “Breathtaking Baby” episode).For those of you with children, Mt Rainier is a wonderful place to bring them to give them a little taste of America’s beauty firsthand. There is a lot to see and do there if you like the outdoors, and like to hike. It is a big mountain! The Wonderland Trail around the base is 93 miles long, and a tough hike! The day after I finished my climb to the summit, I took my then 11 year old daughter up to a snowfield where I had trained, and taught her what I had learned from RMI about “self arrest” with an ice axe. Sixteen years later, she still remembers that vividly, and I remember that day as one of my favorite highlights of my life with her. I loved my first visit to Mt. Rainier at age 18, I loved my visits with my family as an adult, and I cannot wait to return again this coming fall!If you have the chance, visit Mt. Rainier!","May 17, 2013",My Favorite National Park,149,Nashville,5

Its possible to walk some part of the Golden Gate trail, starting just behind the falls.Lunch : you can eat sandwiches and soup in the building of the visitor center.In the afternoon :- photo's of the reflection lakes - walk the Bench & snow lakes trail, (just some hundred meters at the right side of the road behind the reflection lakes ) - only 235 m of elevation (crossing 3 ridges) with some steep but short climbs, easy walk level - some snowpatches at the end. do not descend to the Bench lake , the view from the path is the best. Duration : 1.30 to 2.00 h , depending of the time you take to admire the Snow lake.For all these walks the Mount Rainier is just in front (or behind) you.Plan from 15.30h to 18.00h : drive the beautiful Stevens Canyon Road and do another (level) walk :The walk of the Patriarchs (1.00 h) with plenty of very,very old trees.Really one of our best days of our trip.and don't forget : the Sunrise area - other side of the Mount Rainier - (other day) is also a must Do.

Mount Rainier,"I took the Nisqually Entrance to the Mount Rainier National Park and drove to Paradise, Washington which is about a mile up the south slope of Mount Rainier. It is one of the most popular and heavily visited areas in the Park and one of the snowiest places on earth. The Paradise road was clear of snow when I drove it on June 6, 2012, and the scenery was truly awesome.The green of the dense forests set against Mount Rainier’s vast snowfields is something worth seeing at least once in a lifetime. I took my time driving up Mount Rainier and stopped often to soak in the landscape. There were several stops at the Nisqually river bed where snow and melting ice flow from the Nisqually glacier, one of the larger glaciers on Mount Rainier. I also remember stopping at beautiful Christine Falls to walk a short trail and eat lunch. As I approached the Paradise Visitor Center the snow on either side of the road had formed walls ten feet tall. It was cloudy and chilly when I arrived in Paradise. Mount Rainier gets record moisture from weather systems moving off the Pacific Ocean. So, cloudiness is the norm and I would have been very lucky if the day had been sunny. The Paradise Visitor Center was a warm and inviting retreat on this chilly day, but the chill didn’t dampen anyone’s enthusiasm. There were cross country skiers on the trails and a chain of hikers climbing Mount Rainier. There were glorious views to be enjoyed all around Paradise, including the majestic snow-covered Cascade Range, trees bent over by mountains of snow, and the beautiful Paradise Inn, open only in summer. Paradise indeed. I love this place.","January 15, 2013",Highway to Paradise,203,"Alexandria, Virginia",5

The photo ops are countless. Glacial rivers, snouts, and Mt. Rainier's glaciers are so close and visible. Now in terms of cell phone or wi-fi, forget it. We got nothing here, inside the park.

Mount Rainier,"For those who love photography, this is the place to be! You get beautiful views of Mount Rainier rising above Reflection Lake. A great place for photography at sunrise, early in the morning, later in the evening or at sunset. We initially wanted to get here quite early as you get the best reflections when the water is still calm. Sunrises are stunning too if you don't mind getting up very early in the summer.Because the road through Stevens Canyon was closed when we were there due to a landslide we had to drive almost 2 hours instead of 45 minutes to get to the Paradise area. We really didn't want to get up that early and left our hotel around 9.00am. We did get to Reflection Lake in the late morning and the water was still a little calm, just enough to get some reflections.There is a parking lot, but don't worry if you can't see the beautiful view from there. There is a very short trail that takes you along the lake where you get the amazing views of the water and Mount Rainier.You can find Reflection Lake about 3 miles east of the Paradise area (visitor center)","December 17, 2012",Don't miss Reflection Lake if you like photography!,174,"Vancouver, Canada",5

The very next day the mountain was socked in with light rain temps in the low 40's but it cleared up in the afternoon.

After lunch we enjoyed a longer hike through the gorgeous Nisqually Vista Trail with its alpine scenery and meadow wildflowers. The hike ended at the Paradise Visitor Centre. On our way back to Seattle we stopped for another hike to the old growth forest at Twin Firs, a river walk at the Carter Falls Trailhead and a final stop at Kautz Creek.

Mount Rainier,"To understand my love for Washington State, you have to understand that I'm from Texas. Don't get me wrong, I love Texas and wouldn't live any place else -- except for Washington state.Years ago, I chose to follow my husband to Washington state when he was stationed at Fort Lewis. It was love at first sight when I set eyes on the Cascades, and when one sunny day Mount Rainier peeked out from under the ever-present rain clouds, I couldn't believe I was living at the base of such a huge volcano. (Remember I'm from Texas, so its pretty flat around most of the state.)Don't get me wrong, the Colorado mountains are pretty too, but you are already several hundred feet about sea level when you are in Colorado. In Washington State, those mountains rise straight up from sea level, and you just can't imagine how big, beautiful and dramatic Mount Rainier is. You have to see it to believe it. Like I said, AWESOME!!!!The mountains of western Washington are green, with soft, spongy moss covering softens the rugged terrain. Those mountains are in a rainforest, and the rushing streams, wildflowers and wild life are something to behold. I was priviledged to live at the edge of the forest at the base of Mount Rainier for almost two years. It was literally right outside my front door. And being able to return during the brilliant light of warm sunny summer day was a rare treat for a giant that usually hides behind a thick layer of clouds and fog.Mount Rainier is alive. You can live, breathe and taste the mountain and forest air. It had been 35 years since I'd last seen ""my mountain,"" but the forest sounds and smell came rushing back in a flood of memories the minute I emerged from my car.I've seen Mount Rainier in the middle of winter when the snow was so deep that you felt like you were driving through an ice tunnel, but to see it in the summer with fields of lupines (bluebonnets if you're from Texas) was something I'll never forget.While I do acknowledge that the Rockies are something to see, they can't compare to the sheer size and beauty of Mount Rainier and the Cascades. Have to say I was disappointed when saw the Rockies, because they were just big hills compared to my mountain. If you love mountains, streams, glacier-carved boulders, landslides and meadows cleared by forest fires, then you will want to spend an extra day or two visiting Mount Rainier.","October 25, 2012","Awesome -- Was So Homesick for ""My Mountain""",47,"San Antonio, Texas",5
Mount Rainier,"I felt as if I were in parts of the Himalayas or Iceland. The views on Mt. Rainier are spectacular to say the least. The tall fir trees, the alpine flora, and the scattered glaciers all added to the wonderous views. The hiking was challenging in some places, but light in others. We drove 4.5 hours just to hike for the day and then head out and it was worth our time. I recommend taking appropriate clothing and jackets with you even if it's summertime, since the temperatures are cold as you ascend the mountain and hike the trails. Bring plenty of snacks and water too in your backpack since it could be several hours before you get back to civilization and are able to buy food. I recommend taking a hiking pole with you, as this made the hike easier for us. Being able to walk up to the glaciers was a cool experience (pun intended). Be aware of the conditions on the mountain as they change quickly throughout the day. If you have your camera and happen to see the entire view of Rainier, do yourself and take a picture while you can. It won't take long for clouds to move in and cover up the mountain, then you'll lose your opportunity to take beautiful pics of this giant mountain. Reaching the trails was very easy from the parking place located near the visitors center. Come early and plan on spending all day here if you really want to do this place some justice.","October 17, 2012",Stunning otherworldly vistas,126,"Jacksonville, Florida",5
Mount Rainier,"We took exit 68 east to Morton, left 68 to north on Rt. 7 to Rt. 706 east to enter Mt. Rainier National Park. We paid our $15 to enter, and headed to Paradise! That is where the Jackson visitor center was at about 6000 ft., on 14410 ft. Mt. Rainier, with a view of its south side. It was cloudy when we arrived, so we had lunch while we waited for the clouds to pass. The clouds parted, and we had a great view of the summit from our café table. The food counter help seemed bored. My $5 chili gave me reflux all day (NOT normal for me), and Hubbie’s $10 sandwich was mostly a huge hunk of bread. His $6 beer and my $2.25 were cheaper than at a ballgame & I hope the profits help keep the visitor center open – still worth it, if only tastier! Mt. Rainier looked wider and shorter than Mt. Hood, but was still snowy & bald.We had planned to drive east on to north on 410, to see those sides of Mt. Rainer, but the road east was closed for construction! So we missed Sunrise, etc., we had to go back west and find our way north to Snoqualmie Falls, a place recommended by our son-in-law (who used to live in the area). The back road looked quicker, but we found that since none of them was marked that we made some wrong turns and wasted an hour in the middle of nowhere.","October 16, 2012",Beautiul views of Mt.

Of course we stopped to take zillions of photos.The paths are so well marked and the rangers are hugely helpful. We were overly prepared based on what we read online but that's OK.

Mount Rainier,"We have hiked 4 sides of Mount Rainier. Each side is different. Each elevation is different. Paradise Inn happens to be at a section of the mountain that is amazing and changes as you change elevation. Plan on both short waterfall walks on your drive up to Paradise and take the scenic view side road option that is clearly marked.  There are trails to lookouts with fantastic views suitable for kids. I saw 2 people rolling baby carriages on one glacier over look trail. They even rolled them over some snow fields without too much difficulty. I would recommend papoose packs to visitors with babies over rolling carriages, but you should still go. Why would they attempt such a walk? When you see the Glacier lily and Avalanche lily fields breaking through the receding edge of the snow fields and the resulting avalanche of blooms you will understand. Add to this millions of purple-blue lupine, red paintbrush, etc.. and you see how the place got its name.The real reward comes from trails that go up well above the tree line. On our last hike we did a 11 mile meander up to Pebble creek where you could see Muir Camp (where many climbers start to summit from). Constantly changing views and landscapes are the norm for this hike that starts at Paradise Inn. We saw several glaciers and waterfalls, a bear with 2 cubs, marmot, many other creatures, and much more. The trails are all well maintained, but some are rugged so check with the rangers before you start out for trail status and best destinations/routes as the conditions on the mountain are always changing.Paradise is definitely a place you want on your bucket list!","October 3, 2012",Hike Mt Rainier,59,"Bellevue, Washington",5

Had to backtrack and go south and come back in the West entrance. Paradise was very crowded, no parking places so we just snapped some shots and drove on. Stayed in National Park Inn that night.

We enjoyed the displays at the center and watched hikers start out their climb in their snowshoes. The roads were clear of snow but the snow was piled up really high all long the parking lot.

Note that the park starts shutting down roads past Paradise in mid-September for repairs before the October snow. If you want to go from Paradise to Sunrise, do it during the summer. Snow chains are required to be in your car to even enter the park after November 1. No exceptions. Go on a clear day. If it's cloudy, you won't see the mountain.

We had even read the signs on the way into the park that mentioned road closures from 9/17-9/20 and crowed about how lucky we were as it was 9/14 and so everything should be open. Little did we know ... After my poor navigating got us lost and into a 40 mile detour (I still blame the poor signage) I finally managed to get us almost to Reflection Lake when we discovered that the road was indeed closed! Unfortunately the person re-directing traffic told us the detour to get to Paradise, but neglected to tell us that even from the other side of Paradise the road to Reflection Lake was shut. So, after detouring most of the day we finally left the park without seeing what everyone tells you is the main photographic attraction. A bit of a let down, but still enjoyed the day.

For geology buffs this is a great area, for botany it is a great area, for.... well you get the idea. Oh, and did I mention the continuous looming beauty of Mount Rainier? It is true that thanks to smoky air coming from wildfires in Eastern Washington we could not see as much of the North Cascades as normal, nor could we see the mountain as much as we would have liked. Still it was a wonderful day and early evening. Animal life: We saw a pika close up, which was fun, and several little chipmunks. We saw and heard several birds. When we were on the trail not too far from the parking lot we faintly heard the bugling of elk.

There was also an explosion of visitors. We left on Labor Day Sunday (Sept 2) after having spent 4 nights in the park. Advance reservations at the campground and lodge are so easy to do online- advance being the keyword. The Pebble Creek trail and Glacier Vista trails starting from the Skyline trail were colorful, crowded, and marmots posed unconcerned while feasting on the lush green leaves. We also saw a fox in the Cougar Rock Campground. The ranger said it was vulpes vulpes cascadiensis, red fox, but this one was bushy black with a spot of silver-white on the tail. It was a perfect cloudless bluebird sky for hiking the well marked trails, except the summit of Mt Rainier sported a lenticular cloud cap. The traffic was a KILLER!

Mount Rainier,"Mount Rainier is beautiful country but can get very crowded in the summer time. We took a day trip on Sunday of Labor Day weekend and had to wait 15-20 minutes to even go up the road to the Sunrise Day Lodge area since the parking lot was full. The young Ranger taking the $15 per car fee was very pleasant to talk to.It was a bright sunny day with the wild flowers in bloom and the hiking was excellent. We took the kids (ages 5 and 7) to Shadow Lake a fairly easy hike, a round trip of 3.5 miles and an elevation gain 200 ft. They got a little tired but we kept them going. It's a beautiful serene lake with hike-in camping nearby if you are so inclined. You walk through beautiful alpine forest to get there. Along the way are great vistas of Mount Rainier. You are a little further from the mountain than at the other major lodge, Paradise, so you get a better perspective of the vastness of the range. The day lodge at Sunrise closes on Labor Day but the road stays open till the first big snowfall usually around mid October. It takes about 2 hours to get there from Tacoma or Olympia and almost 3 from Seattle. Expect another 30 to 45 minutes to make it up the 14 mile curvy road to Sunrise. For a really nice driving treat, drive to Paradise after you visit Sunrise. It's a 55 miledrive through the park with spectacular views all along the way.Tip: To get great pictures of the Rainier from Sunrise, arrive early so the sun is behind you or wait for a spectacular sunset. The middle to afternoon hours the sun is above the mountain making picture taking difficult in the bright light.","September 9, 2012",Beautiful but?,11,"Olympia, Washington",5
Mount Rainier,"Didn't really know what to expect before our visit. Absolutely wonderful. Started on one of the 'moderate' trails and then transferred to one of the 'strenuous' trails. We spent about 5 and a half hours walking up the mountain but it was well worth it. The sun was beating down on us and we were walking in the snow. Awesome! The alpine meadows were beatiful and then as you made your way up the mountain the scenery changed. Wow! Just WOW! I am not athletic nor am I a fit person, but if you just take your time making your way up the mountain it is just such a wonderful and satisfying feeling. The views will stay with me for ever.","September 9, 2012",Beautiful!!!,6,liverpool,5

Mount Rainier,One day is not enough. Mt Rainier is not easy to get to from Seattle - a pleasent two and a half hour drive from downtown Seattle after you get past Tacoma. Our day started with iffy weather but turned BEAUTIFUL. Entered the Park from the Nisqually entrance and drove to Paradise and on to the Reflections Lakes and back. With stops at ourstanding views and points of interest along the way. Had a good lunch at the Paradise Visitors Center - they even serve Rainier beer! The National Park Service has done justice for this great American icon with limited funds. They need more! The beauty of this place is only surpassed by the Grand Canyon in America in it's grandeur.

Mount Rainier,"Our visit to Mount Rainier in mid-August was perfect! The wildflowers were at near or peak bloom and covered the hills - Blue lupines, red Indian Paintbrush, yellow cinquefoils, red paintbrush and white daisies and avalanche lilies Park in the lot at the Paradise Visitor Center (it may be full but there are overflow lots) and the paved trail is right there. It's a gradual uphill climb but you'll be stopping frequently to take photos and just to enjoy the view. Be sure to take the trail to Myrtle Falls/Edith Creek to see a lovely waterfall. View the gentle little falls from the bridge, but be sure to go down the trail just before the bridge to see the much larger falls - surprising to see so much water from such a gentle little stream. We had clear blue skies, but keep in mind that the weather can change here and clouds and fog may obscure the mountain. Also, check ahead of time to make sure the snow has melted. Snow can often remain on the hill til late summer.","September 3, 2012","Beautiful! Paved trail, gorgeous wildflowers",198,"Glenelg, Maryland",5

Mount Rainier,"The wonderfully helpful folks at Seattle's Moore Hotel suggested a day trip to Mount Rainier National Park. A large, comfortable bus arrived at Moore Hotel and took about 30 guests on a phenomenal journey. The witty driver/guide (""Take a walk up the hill, if you're so 'inclined'"") took us to out-of-the-way waterfalls, cold mountain streams and phenomenal views of the snow-capped volcano. The entire day was like being part of a Travel Channel video. A few suggestions to make your trip more comfortable: Take a gallon jug of water, bananas, granola bars, and nuts. Food at resorts and roadside cafes is expensive and wait times is excessive, when several buses arrive at the same time.

At the top, there are several paved trails with not too much climbing. There are also several lookouts on the way up, some with easy trails. The drive from Seattle is an easy one. It takes roughly two hours. You do lose a cell signal (at least with AT&T) when you get close to the park. I only mention this because I was trying to look up the trails online as my husband drove, so I would suggest doing this ahead of time. They'll give you limited information at the ranger station when you enter the park. Also, for the faint of heart, I wanted to mention that the roads going up the mountain are plenty wide and well paved/maintained.","August 28, 2012",Don't miss this if you're in WA!,106,Illinois,5
Mount Rainier,"I only had 2 weekends in Seattle to play. One was going to be downtown and the other I thought was going to be on the Olympic pennisula and Hurricane Ridge but I could not find lodging in Port Townsend. When I ran my plans by a former Seattlelite, she said ""If you drive to Mount Rainier, it will be a drive you will never forget"" She was right. I loved everything about the day and the trip. August 2012, warm, sunny, meadow flowers in bloom, sights like I'd never seen.There was a sign at Longmire that the Paridise parking lot was full so we parked at Longmire and took the shuttle to Paridise. The shuttle stops at serveral other spots before it gets to Pariside. If I had it to do over, I would drive further and park at one of the later shuttle stops or drive through to Paridise and if I couldn't find a parking space then drive back down to one of the shuttle stops and take the shuttle to Paridise from there. By taking the shuttle, we saw only what could be seen from the bus between Longmire and Paridise. There were some scenic vistas I would have liked to stop at.I also underestimated the amount of time we would want to spend there. We were only in the park about 4-5 hours and that was not enough. We should have gotten up and headed for the park first thing in the morning. We could have taken a ranger tour or watched the video at the visitor center, checked out the gift shop...Take food and water with you. Warm sunny day, the place was packed. Paridise Inn closes at 2:00pm and doesn't start dinner till 5:30pm. We only saw one other cafe for food and the line was really long. We opted for bottles of water and crackers because we could get in and out without waiting.","August 28, 2012",So glad I got to visit,25,"Jacksonville, Florida",5

We (me, my wife, 14 yr old son and 12 year old daughter) hiked up Skyline Trail among the wildflowers and amazing views of the Rainier glaciers, Mt. Adams and Mt. St Helens. We then went most of the way up through the snow field to Camp Muir. There were enough people out in the snow field so you could follow others boot tracks, but not so many you felt crowded. We had rented snow pants from Whitaker Mountaineering. We did not need them on the way up since the weather was so nice. We put them on for some amazing glissading (or ""butt sledding"" as my daughter called it) back down to Skyline. We were on the mountain about 7 hours and then checked out the lodge and visitor center, then had plenty of time to head back to Ashford and get cleaned up before a good, hearty dinner at the Copper Creek Inn.","August 20, 2012",Muir Snowfield Hike,118,Connecticut,5

We hiked up towards the Skyline Trail to give us a chance to see the nice views. We could see Mt St Helens in the distance. On our second day, we saw a mother bear with two cubs. They were in a meadow near Paradise Falls just eating and playing, we were able to watch them from a safe distance for about 30 min.We also saw several mammots and many deer.Some of the other hikes we really enjoyed were Myrtle Falls, Narada Falls, Christine Falls.

Mount Rainier,"We had stayed at White river camp ground for two days, it is first come first serve camp site. When we visited, it was not hard to find a camp site. By the parking lot, there is a trail head which will leads to a log bridge over the river, it was quite a sight. We had visited Sunrise visit center. Went one a ranger guided tour, and also went on short hike by ourselves. There is a wonderland trail goes from sunrise visitor center to white river camp site, about miles, mostly descending, easy trails. The wild flower is amazing. There are pretty lakes, meadows, and glacier, of course. There is Narada fall, it was gorgeous, only .1 mile hike down from the parking lot to the fall. You can experience a big fall so closely, with the wind blowing, you are virtually in shower, so cool... Just be prepared there is no cellular service, nor internet access withing the park, actually quite some distance before entering the park as well. there are a few gift shop within the park, where there is visitor center.

Mount Rainier,"I will confess: I am a Rainierhead. Since I was 19, I've taken every chance I can find to get on or around the Mountain. It is almost inexhaustible in view, in challenge, and in beauty.I rarely go to Paradise, and was reminded this weekend of my love-hate relationship with that mot-visited part of the park. On the one hand, it is a remarkable place. In the previous two weeks I'd hiked to Summerland, to Frozen Lake and Berkeley Park, and wandered Sunrise extensively. This has been the best wildflower season at each elevation that I've seen in years. Paradise was in full riot, subtle shifts in type and color driven by microclimates, but constant beauty for miles. It was also immeasureably packed - it was, after all, a perfect mid-August sunny afternoon.Paradise is not adventure hiking (ignore the lads with the skis on their backs heading up to the snowfields). The trails are largely paved. This is a place to ooh and ah at Rainier, at the Tatoosh range, and Alta Vista and Panorama Point...and at the dozens of purple or gold or pink or lavender or white or yellow flowers, to enjoy the melt off streams in the meadows, to deep breathly of the scent of this aptly-named nirvana.It is not a place to ignore the many, many, many signs (mostly in English, sadly, but several in a dozen tongues) making it clear that you do not, under any circumstances, leave the trail to go play with the flowers. You might kill hundreds just to get to that one perfect paintbrush for a picture. You're in a subalpine meadow at 6000 with thin volcanic soil. Trust me, if I can keep from going all Julie Andrews here and dancing through the meadows, so can you. Heck, dance through the meadows ON THE TRAIL. It is a lovely, lovely place. The staff and volunteers do what they can, although the volunteers confirmed to me that they could neither cite, stun or shoot meadow stompers. Alas.Rant aside, go to this place. Expect crowds and traffic and a view amongst the best in the world. If you want more...there are hundreds of miles of trails and roads that can get you to every corner of the park. There are flowers everywhere, and if it's clear you can hardy miss the mountain itself. Just be good to Old Tahoma.","August 15, 2012",A Rare Rant (in defense of Paradise),119,"Kent, Washington",5
Mount Rainier,"Mount Rainier National Park is truly amazing. I've heard from many others that August is the best time to go, so we decided to make the trip in August. We were not disappointed. We spent the day there, and really would have loved a few days. There is just so much to see and do. The views are breathtaking this time of year. You get the combination of blue skies, wildflowers, and snow capped mountains. We took our 3 girls (ages 9,8,3), and enjoyed a few beautiful hikes. Our favorite hike was to Bench Lake & Snow Lake. It was about 2.5 miles round trip, and it was beautiful. We hiked through beautiful meadows, and the lakes were gorgeous.

Mount Rainier,"My husband, two boys and I visited Mt. Rainier in August. Wow, what a treat. The wildflowers were in spectacular bloom at both Paradise and Sunrise. We did a portion of the skyline hike at Paradise, visited Myrtle Falls, and spent some time at the visitor center. The wildflowers were definitely the highlight and what a contrast to the almost 6 feet of snow over part of the trail behind Paradise Visitor Center. I highly recommend walking/hiking around at both Paradise and Sunrise. The views are spectacular, the hikes are worth the effort for sure. You just can't see beauty like that from the comfort of your automobile.The trails are not super well marked, a little hard to follow. I would suggest a talk with a park ranger before setting off on a hike, just to avoid disappointment or back-tracking.My favorite part of Mt. Rainier was seeing the mountain ""out"" and enjoying the natural beauty of the falls, wildflowers, and scenery. August was definitely the best timing for our visit. We visited the park 2 years ago in May and never once saw the mountain. We were actually surprised this trip by the massiveness of the mountain. It is just massive and beyond words beautiful when visible.

Mount Rainier,"Hiking to the Panorama point in Paradise was by far the most beautiful and exciting hikes I have every been on! No matter where you look, there is a picture perfect scene. We were told to leave Seattle early (before 9 am), and found that it gave us just enough leeway to enjoy the waterfalls and viewpoints before arriving to the picnic area in Paradise. We enjoyed our lunch there and walked to the visitor center 10 min away. This was a great idea, because the parking lot was full and most other people parked far away and had to hike up a long road!Although we were initially given a map, we were happy we stopped by the visitor center to get a detailed map. This gave us the advantage of exploring more trails along the way. If you are going on a hot summer day in August like we did, I would strongly recommend the Dead Horse Creek trail followed by the Skyline Trail that brings you to the Panorama Point. On this hike, you will be rewarded with breathtaking views of mountain ranges, beautiful alpine wildflowers, creeks and waterfalls and of course, the continuous sight of Nisqually Glacier. The pictures we took on this hike were phenomenal!We were told that we could do the hike in 2-3 hours ( roundtrip) but we were extremely slow and stopped every 2 minutes to take pictures, as a result it took us 4-5 hours before we returned to our car in the parking lot. You will be hiking up steep slopes as well as snow, but we saw saw many seniors make it up, as well as three year olds! Just make sure you pack enough water and cliff bars. Hiking sticks would have been useful too! Don't worry about staying well hydrated, there is a bathroom at Panorama point with toilet paper! I would have to say that this bathroom has one of the best views in the world! The hike up to Panorama point from Paradise was definitely worth it and I strongly recommend it to any one who can physically make it up there!","August 10, 2012",Paradise!,124,"Montreal, Canada",5

When we reached the area of the old growth trees there is a suspension bridge to cross and I must say I am amazed at the people who don't follow directions in that it clearly states one person at a time and we witnessed a mother tell her 2 teens to cross together, obviously they did not cross it quietly and were reprimanded by a park ranger who happened to witness. I wanted to clap. We had our National Park Passport books with us so stopped at the service centers. They were clean and well maintained.

Mount Rainier,It's photo opp heaven. With views of sweeping vistas to the smaller wonders of close up photo opp's. Lot's of great pullouts and keep your eyes peeled for wildlife. From the big hike to the small day trips this is a place to spend some serious time. We get a park pass every year and its always been well worth it. What we like best are the views and trails. This is an all day event for some and a half day event for others depending on what you want to do and how much you would like to see.Always be prepared with warm clothing for less then perfect weather as the mountain makes its own and you just never know sometimes until it's upon you.

However, try to visit during July/ August. There will be snow, but you won't feel cold. Try to wear comfortable clothes. Take jackets in case you want to spend the night. Don't miss Crystal falls and Narada falls. I would definitely advise you to spend a night there may be in your tent or in a lodge. Thing you take with you: extra socks, waterproof shoes, extra clothes (in case you want to get wet under the falls), lots of water and dry bar.

Mount Rainier,"If you are going to Seattle, be it for a short weekend or a long stay vacation. GO TO RAINIER !!Right from when I left my hotel (shuttle pick up service) the whole trip was nothing short of bewildering! I was first driven out of Seattle (just to confirm to readers this was a Pre paid trip) on tho the highway. All the while the driver (Mark) was telling us (us as in the small group of about 8 people) history of Seattle, all about how it was founded and it was just a superb way to learn about a new city (New to me any way)I was driven through some small villages and towns, all of which were very quirky and as you would imagine a small American town to be.Once in the park it was just superb! So much to see, my eyes could hardly take it all in as I was driven up to the summit.It was VERY foggy/misty, which meant the mountain cap remained hidden nevertheless, it was still a very tranquil place to be. There is a small shop which offers some actually pretty nice stuff for the money! Make the most of this shop as the one at the east end is not so good.The drive back down *entering south and exiting east* was as amazing, To be honest words cant describe what it was like.So I encourage ANY ONE to do this! GO TO RAINER!

We were taking a road trip which began in Seattle and this was our 3rd day in our 2 week trek. It was getting later in the day and we decided to see if there was any lodging in the area. We were fortunate to secure a room at Paradise for the night. The only drawback is that we were given a handicapped accessible room right behind the lobby, which turned out to be VERY noisy. Otherwise, you couldn't help but fall in love with the Lodge and the views. We felt like we had entered another world. Snow abounded and there were many who attempted a hike up Mt.

Grove of the Patriarchs was beautiful and is great if you are looking for an easy stroll. These trees are ancient and large, however, they are dwarfs compared to the giant sequoia's at Yosemite.

You'll be happy with yourself if you bring a good quality camera as it is difficult to capture the awesomeness of the views.

The temperature was cold for June but I expected that since we were climbing a mountain.Once we got to Paradise Visitor Center, the sun was shining and the fog was gone. It was also relatively warm so we were very surprised to see snow still covering the hiking trails.I had on hiking boots but my friend had sneakers. We were not prepared and did not know there would still be snow on the hiking trails here. We'd checked the status and it said trails open but we never assumed that it was still snow covered. So we attempted our ascent to see the Nisqually Glacier. It was tough going without hiking sticks. There also wasn't much cover for shade.We should've brought our sunblock to re-apply as we were sweating profusely and all the sunblock we had on our face were sweated off. And we didn't bring hats. Snow glare was an issue. It took us over an hour to ascend about 1,000 feet. It was slow going.We did manage to see the peak and parts of the glacier once we reached a view point. We felt unable to go on towards Panorama Point and turned back from there. Going down was even worse as we didn't have traction on our feet.Dispite being so unprepared, it was worth it.","July 2, 2012",We weren't prepared,160,"New York City, New York",4

We hiked about 3 hours up and 1 hour back. Absolutely spectacular scenery! Getting back to Paradise I was surprised to see many empty parking spots at 1:00 pm. Even more surprised to see a couple of empty shuttle buses from distant lots .. sure glad I didn't waste my limited time waiting for a shuttle! Instead of backtracking, we drove on towards Ohanapecosh. Definitely stop at Box Canyon and take a short hike to the 2nd canyon bridge .. breathtaking!

This is a very touristy visitor center so expect a lot of crowds. The Ranger did help my daughter with her project of doing the Junior Ranger program. Our hike consisted of going up a snow trail to get a better view of the mountain.The view were great on the drive up and down from Paradise. I would have liked to also gone to the East side to see the meadows but another time. There was not a lot of peaceful quite to be had here, as the trails were under snow, and we were not prepared for snow hiking.

The mountain is gorgeous - the hiking is fantastic - though we were limited to the packed snow areas as we didn't have snowshoes. Would love to come back July-Sept when the wildflowers bloom in a ring around the peak from ~5,000-7,000 ft elevation. The visitor center at Paradise is great - a beautiful structure and nice exhibits as well as good looking food options (we didn't dine there as we had a packed lunch from the inn we were staying at). We wish we had more time but we lingered in Seattle longer than planned (a great city!).

It's a little bit of a trip from Seattle, but we did there and back on the same day and it worked out well for us, though if the snow had been gone and we could hike, it would have been tougher time wise.

So we feel we should take advantage of coming here every summer. Hiking among alpine flowers is absolutely gorgeous. Our 10 years old son made it to Camp Muir with his dad twice so far.

Mount Rainier,"We drove from Portland, OR to Mount Rainier National Park as a day trip. We got to Mount Rainier late morning. We thought that we were late getting there but really to get the best view of the mountain we could have even been later and have been fine. We entered the park at the Nisqually Entrance in the Southwest. As we got to the gate of the park, we were told that there was a good chance that the mountain would be ""out"" as the day wore on. Not having been here before, we weren't familiar with that term or exactly what it meant. We just nodded and continued on our drive. Our first stop was at Christine Falls. It was a beautiful waterfall and well worth a stop to see. Our second stop was Narada Falls. The sign indicated a short walk to the falls so we decided to walk it. This was a very steep, unpaved walkway. It wasn't long but it was difficult to navigate both down the hill and up the hill. The view of the falls at the bottom was definitely worth the walk! It was breathtaking! At this point we were almost at Paradise where the visitor's center and top of Mount Rainier was waiting and we had yet to even see the mountain for the heavy fog and clouds. We were definitely beginning to understand the meaning of the mountain being ""out""!We continued on our drive to Paradise and got to the Visitor's Center which is very nice. There are restrooms, a gift shop, restaurant and lots of information available here. There also should have been a great view of the top of the mountain but instead we had a great view of a cloud! We listened to the ranger explain that sometimes the mountain comes out and sometimes it doesn't but if you see a little bit of blue sky from the west, there may be a chance that the mountain will clear for about a minute or so. Ok....I had no idea it was so elusive! We decided to stick around for a little bit and see what happened. There was a short walk up the mountain to Myrtle Falls so we decided to walk that direction. It was listed as a 0.5 mile walk with an elevation of 100 feet. It also said it was wheelchair accessible and while it was paved, I'm not sure I would want to be pushing a wheelchair up or down that incline! It felt like a whole lot more than an incline of 100 feet but there were places to stop and you could take it at your own pace. As we got close to Myrtle Falls we began to see just a little bit of blue sky and then all of a sudden, the top was visible. It was out for about a minute like the ranger said and then as quickly as it had come out, it was gone again. Myrtle Falls was another beautiful waterfall to see and worth the short trek to the bottom to see it.Satisfied that we had at least caught a glimpse of the top, we headed out of Paradise and continued on through Stevens Canyon. Part of this road is closed for construction so you could only go part way but the part we saw was well worth the drive. Waterfalls and beautiful canyon scenery everywhere. We turned around at the area that the road closed and back to the Nisqually Entrance. On our way back towards the mountain, the skies cleared and we had an unbelievably clear and beautiful view of the top of Mount Rainier! In fact we stopped right in the middle of the road to take photos. It was a beautiful sight!This is a great day trip from either Portland or Seattle and one that I would recommend. I would suggest not going too early in the day as one of the park rangers indicated that the top usually becomes visible between 4 and 6 pm on days that it's going to be visible. She said that most people leave the park by that time and miss seeing it, so plan for a little later start so you can see as much as possible.","October 27, 2011",Well Worth the Drive to this Beautiful Area,297,"Niles, Ohio",5
Mount Rainier,"Took the kids to visit Mt. Rainier while we were in seattle because we had an unexpected bit of gorgeous weather. Unfortunately, the only park road open at this time of year was closed for several hours for hazard tree removal (aka blowing up trees!). This wasn't posted on the website and even the ranger at the gate only told us to expect a short delay. After we waited out the two hours, though, the rest of the day was perfect. Clear skies with wonderful views. As I was the only adult and we didn't have many provisions, we did several of the shorter walks: Carter Falls (where the kids loved climbing on the rocks), Narada Falls, Nisqually Vista, and the shorter waterfall hike at Paradise. The ranger at Longmire was kind enough to suggest all of those.If the weather looks favorable, this park is so worth a visit.","October 25, 2011",Near perfect day!,38,"Charlottesville, Virginia",5

Just GO you will not be disappointed!On a mid-September, convention bureau day, we drove from our ""Deep Forest Cabin"" accommodation in Ashford just outside the park entrance to the visitor center in Paradise. The road leading to the visitor center is designed and routed to take in the best vistas along the way. There are many stops to see this magnificent mountain with several ""attractions"". Here is a list of the Roadside Attractions: http://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/longmire.htm. Do not miss taking the Ricksecker Point Road or do a short downhill stroll from the parking area to see Narada Falls from below.Embarrassing note: We did not do this National Park proper justice by getting a late start and only allocating one day to visit.At Paradise we opted to hike the Skyline Loop via the High Skyline Trail. http://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/upload/Paradise-Area-Trails-Aug11.pdf Unequivocally this is one of the most scenic enjoyable hikes we have ever taken. Starting from 5,400 ft elevation it seems like you can touch the summit of 14,400 ft Mount Rainier. The trail (1,700 ft elevation change) traverses alongside Nisqually Glacier, proceeds to the ""high"" point and loops back to the center parking area near the lodge accommodations. The wildflowers were in full regalia, the meadow views idyllic and the expansive vistas of the Cascades to include formidable Mt Baker with Mt St Helens in the distance are second to none. Believe me, we have been on a ton of mountain trails all around the world!Afterward we enjoyed some ale and conversation on the patio at the lodge with a group of retired Department of Defense (based in Japan and Germany) elementary teachers who have traveled extensively.

Mount Rainier,"We rented a car and drove out here from Seattle.Once you get past the city and it's suburbs the drive is pretty.I had heard you could see Rainier from Seattle, we had not yet seen it due to a couple of cloudy days.This day was a lot clearer and yet we still couldn't, I was scared at one point we were going the wrong way.We finally started to see signs for Mt Rainier, and soon entered the park, first of all we stopped at Christine falls, it is so beautiful, an amazing waterfall framed by a cute bridge and all the lovely trees.Then we stopped at Narada falls, it was pretty, you could walk down to get a good view of it and you could feel all of the spray coming off the falls.Then we headed on to Paradise lodge to start our hike, I'm still wondering at this point why it is we can't see the Mountain at all.When we get to the lodge we checked out the gift shop first and I asked the lady working there, she said that clouds are just sitting on the mountain today and don't seem to be moving and that she hoped at some point they would move away.We started the Panorama point trail, 4 miles 5 hour strenuous hike, and we just hoped it would clear at some point.It was breathtaking, in the other direction was a huge mountain range that we could see the whole time.The wildflowers were wonderful, so many different kinds, very pretty.With the trees, flowers and the snow capped mountains, it almost looked as if we were in the alps, and the smell was wonderful, like berries and pine.Different parts of the trail we had to cross streams and a lot of snow.Finally the higher we were getting Mt Rainier starting making a slight appearance through the clouds.We were almost at the top, and took the shorter way which was completely snow covered and was actually very scary to cross, but we made it and it was a wonderful experience. After we rested at Panorama point for a little bit in the clouds, we started to make our way down and that's when it cleared off completely and we were amazed by it's beauty, so intimidating, and so spectacular.We were so happy that the clouds had cleared for us, and it was a beautiful day.This was a great hike and so glad we chose to do this one, on the way we saw many more waterfalls, myrtle falls is very pretty, and we also saw a lot of marmots, chipmunks and quail.After making our way back to the paradise lodge we were super hungry, got some food. Then we hiked the short Nisqually glacier trail, nice views if you are looking for an easy short hike.This is definitely one of our favorite national parks, we really loved it.This is a must if you are visiting Seattle.","October 10, 2011","Gorgeous National park, a must see, It's beautiful.",417,"Camas, Washington",5
Mount Rainier,"We visited Mount Rainer in late September. We had to change our plans around a bit due to changing weather, but we at least got some sun when we were out hiking. We parked at the Sunrise visitor center. We had to wait about an hour at the gate because there were too many visitors in the park. However, the wait and the almost two hour drive from Seattle were well worth it. The hiking trails around Sunrise are fantastic and provide excellent views of Mount Rainer, surrounding mountains, and beautiful meadows with wildflowers. I was really impressed with the scenery and the ease of hiking on the trails.That being said, some caution is in order: not all of the trails are exactly the same. We hiked up the Sourdough Ridge trail, which was wide, well maintained, and easy to hike on. We were planning on going back to Sunrise via the Wonderland Trail, however, since we were enjoying the hike so much we decided to take a loop around the Burroughs Mountain Trail and the Sunrise Rim Trail. These trails were an entirely different story. The trails were very narrow in places (sometimes less than 1 foot wide) with slippery rocks and gravel. Many places along the Sunrise Rim Trail had very steep slopes that dropped a long distance. We also had to traverse a steep ice patch on the Burroughs Mountain Trail. To be honest it was dangerous and a little scary. In retrospect I wish we had stuck to our original plan.Despite some scary trails we had a great time and saw some unbelievable views. I'm glad we had the opportunity to take this hike.","October 10, 2011",Amazing Hiking,210,"Ellicott City, Maryland",5
Mount Rainier,"I love Mt Rainier and can't recommended it highly enough. Visiting the park is definitely a must, whether it's your first trip to Washington or not. If you want to go in the winter and ski at Crystal Mountain, that's a good option, but personally, my favorite time of year is in the late summer, especially if you can see the wildflowers blooming in the alpine meadows. The Mirror Lake reflection is a beautiful photo op, and if you can watch the sun set or rise over the mountain, all the better.I've done the Mt Rainier Scenic Railroad as well, and I do recommend it, but with one caveat: It's a great trip if you're interested in historic trains and want a relaxing ride through the woods, but you don't get good views of the mountain from the train, just one shot over a meadow, and it's a bit far away. For the best views drive up into the park and camp if you have the extra time.","October 7, 2011",Do NOT miss this destination!,43,Seattle,5
Mount Rainier,"The views are fantastic even those not of Mount Ranier. Mount Ranier was just beautiful when on our 4th day we actually saw the entire mountain. We enjoyed several short, fairly easty trails. The Nisqually Vista Trail at Paradise had all kinds of flowers. We did the alta Vista trail and the trail to Myrtle Falls on our clear day. Both absolutely worth doing although the elevatioin got me on the Alta Vista Trail. Also did Narada Falls in the Paradise area. Pack a lunch and enoy the picnic area... great vew of the mountain, deer passing by and birds ready to share our lunch. We tried to do the Sunrise Nature Trail but it was 35 degress and snowing,,, back to the car.Although the road is closed at the Stevens Canyon Entrance you can still drive almost there and it is a wonderful drive. You can still get to the Grove of the Patriarchs trail. A short easy trail is the Twin Firs Trail, worth doing. We also did an easy trail in the Longmire area on a rainy day.

The new visitor center at Paradise was beautiful, roomy and even had decent food in the cafeteria.

Mount Rainier,"This park is a must-see for anyone visiting Seattle or Washington State in general. Mount Rainier towers over everything else and it's snow-capped cone shape can be seen from miles away. Up close it's even more impressive. We drove there from Seattle on a perfect sunny, clear day. Every bend of the road gave us a different perspective or angle on the amazing volcano (which is considered active). Along the road toward Paradise (which is where you will find a beautiful lodge, visitor's center, and various hiking trails at the skirt of the mountain) there are several lookouts to stop at, as well as views of rivers and waterfalls. Much can be seen and enjoyed from the car, but of course there are also numerous walking and hiking trails throughout the park--so it's a great outing no matter your age or physical ability.The views from Paradise were especially breathtaking--we were lucky that the sky remained pretty clear so we could see the mountain all day long. At the lodge there is a cafeteria, but I would recommend taking a picnic and having lunch at Paradise or one of the picnic areas on the way.

AAI made the daunting task of reaching the summit of Rainier (14,411 feet) a great experience. They provided good background materials on training for the climb, what to bring and how to rent gear. Their guides on the climb were excellent, focusing on safety , training and coaching needed to make the most of the trek. Their approach were you spend two nights on the mountain (one night in a Hut at Camp Muir and the second night in tents at 11,500') makes for a better experience than the competition's one night trek.

Now this August as we were driving back west, we decided to stop at Mount Rainear again, but this time at Paradise. As we were driving from Kennewick through Yakima and over Chinook Pass, the mountain was fully visible and no clouds in site. But as we came up Stevens Canyon Road and got closer, the cloudier the mountain became and by the time we got to Paradise, it was not visible at all!! We decided to head into the visitor center hoping the clouds would eventually clear up, but when we came back out the clouds had thickened even more. We tried to do a loop hike in Paradise meadows, but within a few feet up the path, it ended in snow. We tried another way up near the lodge, but it ended in snow as well. we gave up and drove off back down the road.

While spectacular in their own accord, Rainier feels less crowded with great hiking and less car traffic. Easier to get in with no waiting at the main gate (no main gate). The campogrounds are lush with 1000 yr old trees. We went with 2 - 5 y/o's and they could've played all day at the campsite! The weather is cooler but a great respite from the hot summer weather in the lower 48. The evenings are long in the summer (doesn't get dark till like 930). You would have to be prepared for the rainy weather but it rarely downpours; just that misty stuff. Make the trip to REI and consider it a good investment in protecting your vacation and you can also use the gear when it get's colder in the lower 48.

Although the snow was too plentiful to do any hiking at Paradise, the views were worth it and it was all the more fun to scout for wildflowers coming out of the snow late in the season.

You'll see waterfalls, classic mountain scenery and maybe some wildlife here but they are not necessarily the most jaw dropping views out there for a National Park and Yellowstone and Glacier have way more wildlife as does Denali. It is worth a visit when you come to the area but be prepared to spend a day or even two if you want to really explore the park.","August 1, 2011",Hope It Is Sunny When You Go,175,"Las Vegas, Nevada",3
Mount Rainier,"There are a lot of wonderful natural parks to visit but Mt. Rainer has to rank up there as one of the most beautiful places to see and should be on people short list. I have been to Mt. Rainer a couple of times many years ago and I have always wanted to take the kids to see an amazing natural wonder, especially since it really is a sleeping volcano. At 14.400 ft it is big. This year we had the chance since we were going on the 7 day roundtrip Alaska Cruise out of Seattle. After the cruise I had a booked three nights at the Mt Haven Resort in Ashford. It is about 80 miles from downtown Seattle to Ashford. A nice stop along the way is to visit Northwest Trek Park. Ashford is on the west entrance which is open year round. We took the Paradise Longmire Rd to Paradise along the route there a lot of great stops to take in the beauty. The day was perfect with no clouds anywhere (not always the case). The road is well maintained with a lot of twists and turns and a few spots where road is right on the edge of the cliffs. First we stopped at the Longmire Wilderness Museum which has some nice park info, this area is home the National Park Inn and Longmire Museum. Here you can take a nice easy trail, “Trails of Shadows” which goes through some of the lower forest area and describes the early Longmire Springs resort. About 5 miles up is a pull off to view Christen Falls with the Stone Bridge crossing it. Narada falls is another stop with some great views, there are some picnic tables in the parking lot area for a quick snack or lunch. Before we went up in the morning we found out that a lot of the trails around Paradise were still covered in about 11 ft. of snow. When we got there it was kind of cool seeing the snow in July on a 80 degree day on the ground. We walked around on the snow but decided not to do any hiking around. Instead we walked around a spent time at the Henry M Jackson Visitor center. They have nice display and movies to watch we grabbed some lunch at the Café which was reasonable especially compared to Paradise Inn next door. When you are there you should take a nice stroll through the historic Paradise Inn. After you leave the Paradise Valley you can continue on to Stevens canyon Rd. A couple of other nice stops on the route is at reflection lake about a mile past Paradise and some trails near the Cougar Rock Picnic and Camp ground. We enjoyed our Alaska trip but going to see Mt Rainer was worth the extra few days we stayed in Seattle. The family enjoyed it and in a lot of ways the sights were as amazing as Alaska and you don’t have to pay hundreds of dollars for a helicopter ride to walk on a glacier. You can do it here and a have a few dollars left over.","August 1, 2011",A Beautiful National Park not to be Missed,205,"Suffield, Connecticut",5

(Driving a mountain road with no side barriers and a 1,000-foot drop had some members of our group hiding on the floor of the car.)

If we had the right gear (sled, snow boots, etc) we could have had a great time, it looked like a lot of people were having fun. We made the best of it and had brunch at the lodge.

There were lots of waterfalls on the side of the road heading to the Paradise visitor center. Once we arrived, we realized that all of the trails up the mountain were covered in 8-10 feet of snow. We had waterproof hiking boots so we climbed up about 1,000 feet for a great view of one of the glaciers. We did not have serious snow gear so we turned back to my son's disappointment.

Mount Rainier,"There are multiple ways to do a day trip to Mt Rainier starting out from the greater Seattle area but these are my two favorite. Both trips begin by entering from Enumclaw heading towards Cayuse Pass. If Sunrise Visitor Center is open (usually only in the middle of summer) this provides spectacular views and is well worth the 30 (total) mile side trip. Continue to Cayuse Pass, Chinook Pass, and then take Hwy 410 just 2 or 3 miles to Lake Tipsoo. In the Summer this beautiful little lake is surrounded by colorful meadow flowers and you’ll often see marmots sunning themselves along the rocks cliffs nearby. Then go back to Chinook Pass and continue to Ohanapecosh. There is an easy 3 mile loop trail to Silver Falls from here that is a great way to get out and stretch the legs. You will then backtrack and head towards Paradise Visitors Center.Here’s where the two routes change: U-turn route – heads back basically the same way you came in but remember the view is completely different going the other direct especially in the mountains! You won’t feel like to have backtracked! I like this route a lot! Loop trip route - This route should begin in Enumclaw going clockwise to get the best views (as described above). I only take this route if we want to stop some place in particular on our way home like Northwest Trek Wildlife Park. Otherwise the U-turn route is by far the most scenic and relaxing.","July 7, 2011",Take the eastern route,138,Puget Sound,5

I climbed the Disappoointment Cleaver route. The registration process went smoothly, and the support staff at Camp Muir really made you feel at home. The chats with other climbers proved delightful. The climb on the 18th went smoothly. The incredible vistas down into the valley and off to the Pacific take your breath away. The lime-green crevasse openings, shining glaciers, and incredible views make this a not-to-miss part of any American experience. As I hiked back down I saw a grey fox trot across the snow and into the woods about a mile above Paradise. Just above Paradise two families had brought their children to sled on a steep hilside beside the snow-covered trail. It just highlighted for me the wonderful variety of activites for people of all ages and all activity levels. Thanks for a great experience!","December 22, 2010","Mt.

Mount Rainier,"Mount Rainer is simply one of the most beautiful places on earth and immeasurably worth the visit. The drive to the lodge partway up the mountain is breathtaking. From the large parking lot, take the trail towards the right to view a beautiful waterfall with a short (about 15 minutes) walk from the parking lot. It is actually possible to miss the waterfall as you cross the creek on a small bridge upstream of the falls, look for a small trail leading steeply downhill on the parking lot side of the bridge for the best view of the falls with Mt. Rainer in the background. At the small settlement at the bottom of the mountain be sure to see the classic Western National Parks headquarters building, the cross section of a massive Douglas Fir that dates back to before Europeans settled North America, and the 1920s style gas station.

Mount Rainier,"We camped at Cougar Rock camp ground near Paradise at Mt. Rainier for 4 nights in September 2010. Weather was near perfect. Temps not too cold (lowest 45-47 at night) and a couple of drops of rain. We hiked to Paradise Glacier for our warm up to hike to the Muir Base Camp elevation @ 10,080 ft! What I like most about Mt. Rainier area is there is something for everyone..whether you just want a ""taste"" of beautiful mountain valley views or want to try more challenging snow field hiking to the Muir Base Camp. At Paradise Glacier we found an unbroken ice cave ..hiked in a little just to get the photo! The hike to Muir Base Camp was exhilarating..but couldn't keep up with the youthful snow boarders who were carrying their boards and gear up the mountain. Coming down was quick and easier using the ""slide on your backside"" technique in the smoother snow pathways. We LOVED Mt. Rainier.","October 22, 2010",What are you waiting for?,75,Virginia,5
Mount Rainier,"My daughter and I camped in Mt. Rainier National Forest in August. I couldn't believe how beautiful the area is. The fact that the sky was deep blue with picture perfect fair weather clouds helped. So did the fact that the fields were filled with wild flowers in full bloom. As we hiked through several areas (Paradise, Grove of the Patriarchs, Narada Falls & Sunrise), we were greeted by friendly locals who continued to tell us they visit the park often and never ever take it for granted. The rangers are very happy to share interesting information. One big recommendation is that getting up early to see the sun rise at Sunrise Lookout is well worth the lost sleep.","October 16, 2010",No one takes it for granted,6,Massachusetts,5
Mount Rainier,"Our trip included a number of National Parks but Mt Rainier was still a highlight. Traveling in August we were fortunate to see the peak for 3 days without cloud, we know this was unusual. We camped at the NP campsite at Cougar Rock, little pitches (but big enough for our 10x16 tent) set among the trees. But warning - no hot water or showers! There always appeared to be pitches available for people who had not reserved(something that often worries me) The ranger programs in the on site amphitheater were good - both for kids and families. We (family incl kids of 11 and 13, not very fit) hiked the skyline trail which was very well worthwhile. Take plenty of water and don't rush but to get up to the flower meadows, to see the end of a glacier and to get just above the snowline was amazing.Stores in the park offer enough to get you by when camping but the restaurant at the Paradise Inn was a welcome treat at the end of the day hiking. No booking but line up juts before they open and you'll be in quickly.We will return, the park is huge (allow a day if you want to drive from Paradise to Sunrise) but it is also very manageable with the peak always there (if not in cloud) to impress.","October 12, 2010",More than we expected,3,"East Bay, CA",5

Unfortunately it was an overcast misty hike on the way up and it was really raining on the way down. We loved every minute of it we did get to see the lower glaciers but because of the fog and clouds we never saw the top of Rainier for anywhere in the park. I am 63 and my brother is 65.

Mount Rainier,"Mount Rainier is a sight to behold! You have never seen something so massive! This mountain can be seen on clear day from Seattle. The drive down from Seattle is a real treat as the mountain looms in the distance, and comes into great view the closer you get. The shear size must be taken in from 20-30 miles away as you can only get a sense of the true magnitude by seeing it from this far away.The drive up to the Mountain is just as majestic as the mountain itself. There are a few small towns on the drive to the park that give you a rustic, back-country feel. It was mid-May and there was still snow at the mid-level of the national park. A neat tidbit was a bridge made out of a log that extended over the main river in its more dormant state. There are pictures throughout the park of the river at full bore, but that is when the great snow melt occurs. We were there when it was no more than a creek. You can walk to both sides of the river with the help of that man-made tree trunk bridge.Once you make the drive the furthest height of the mountain you can, you really feel like you are on top of the world! It is one of the most majestic feelings I've experienced in my life. There are thousand foot mountain peaks around you that are amazing as their own mountains, but pale in comparison to Mount Rainier. This place is wonderful!There was a nice little restaraunt at the Copper Creek Inn on our way back down from the mountain. It has a nice little store and the restaraunt was quaint. Nice lady who talked to us about the history of the place. I definitely recommend it.","August 24, 2010",Top Of The World!,28,"New York City, New York",5
Mount Rainier,"My family and I live about 21/2 hours from the base at the Paradise section. We go to this park often (at least 5 times this summer). If you go on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday you can ride a bus to Longmire and see Paradise and Longmire without having to worry about parking. Going to Longmire was a first this year and I loved the old buildings. Paradise is always beautiful as well. Parking at Paradise is a nightmare and the new center isn't as nice as the old one. Also the food is outrageously priced. Bring a picnic and/or your own snacks!!!! There was snow at an easy walk at mid-July but we went two weeks later and the snow had melted. It was a much longer hike to get to snow level. I'm out of shape so I enjoyed the low snow level trip much better. End of July was hot and of course the hike up the mountain is vertical and tiring. Our daughters (4 and 5) wanted to be carried. If you can visit while the snow is still lower that is the best because it is warm enough to still wear shorts and play in the snow-plus if your out of shape like me there's no need for a major hike. Great family place! Tons of waterfalls and other things to see that are located near the base as well. Again there is hiking all over. A lot of trails are long but there are quite a few that out of shape people like me as well as families with young children could do as well.

Mount Rainier,"Mt. Rainier National Park is beautiful! Even the drive from Seattle is pretty. I visited in mid May around 9am. There were very few cars on the road in the park so it was easy to stop and take pictures. I drove to the Paradise visitors center with the intent of hiking a bit of the Skyline Trail. The mountain still had a foot or so of snow. I wish the website had recommended walking poles. I would have brought them and I would have been able to hike much more of the mountain than I actually did. A hiking group ascended about ten minutes before I did so it was easy to hike up in their footprints. I caught up to them and decided not to continue as there would be no footprints to hike in and was afraid I might get lost or not be able to continue in the snow on my own without poles. I only made it about a half a mile or so up the mountain. I had intended to go a mile or two. Boy was I wrong! Next time I'll visit in the height of summer.Coming down was where the walking poles would have been very helpful. It was very steep and hiking down in the footprints I ascended in was tough. I made it down without falling but there were a few wobbly moments. My legs were tired by the time I reached my car. It's definitely worth the drive from Seattle to the park. And if you're hiking at high elevations in the spring/early summer, bring walking poles.","May 29, 2010",Beautiful!,28,"Brookhaven, PA",5

They could be a little challenging if you're not used to climbing, but keep with it since the rewards are worth it.

Mount Rainier,"We've done a lot of traveling, and hiking, in Ireland and New Zealand and I have to admit that Mt. Rainier is as beautiful as either...which is saying plenty. The combination of the spectacular mountain (on a sunny day), the gorgeous alpine meadows, and the lack of crowds after Labor Day made for a truly enchanting experience. There are hikes for every level of fitness - from longer treks up the mountain to spectacular viewpoints near the glaciers to more pedestrian rambles near Paradise Lodge - they're all great. Quite simply - this one of the most beautiful places we've ever seen, and the hiking is world class.We stayed in Packwood, which we recommend as a convenient, cost-effective, base for exploring the National Park. The pretty little town provides the easiest and most direct access to Sunrise in the north-east area of the park, and a surprisingly good-quality forest road connects Packwood with the Nisqually entrance on the other side, so there's really no reason to pay the substantially higher prices for accommodation on Ashford.We do recommend coming here after Labor Day. The crowds (and traffic) are minimal - especially on a weekday, and you'll have the trails pretty much to yourself - especially the further away you get from the visitor center at Paradise.","September 17, 2009",What a Spectacular Place,116,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5

Mount Rainier,"We took a weekend trip to Mount Rainier during July. The weather was beautiful and the clouds stayed away from the mountaintops. We went to the Paradise side of the park the first day. We recommend taking the FREE shuttle up to the top. Parking is a nightmare! The drivers gave out bits of information as we passed various sights. We have 3 young children so we took a hike down to view the Glacier and hiked back up to the new Visitor's Center. The hike lead us through snow packs and the children enjoyed having snowball fights in the middle of July. Many types of wildflowers are in bloom during this time and the grounds are dotted in beautiful colors.We spent the night in a great ""unknown"" gem. My husband located this place called Shadow Wood on the internet. It is a private owned 22 foot camper that is 7 minutes from the Paradise Park gate. The camper is clean, cozy, and comfy. The owner, Laurie is a friendly hostess who has the camper stocked with everything you might need. She has a beautiful deck next to the camper surrounded by ferns and trees with a table and grill. There is also a campfire pit filled with wood and she even has sticks for those of us who enjoy roasting marshmallows. The kids loved it! And the price was reasonable and affordable. If you like nature and want to be away from loud campers and hotels, this is a perfect place. Note: The camper is located on the same property as the owners home, it is not secluded. But, it is more private then any hotel or campground. It is also near a road. But, after dark we rarely heard any traffic.The second day we went to the Grove of the Patriarch's. This is a must see. The kids especially enjoyed the swinging bridge on this hike and we were able to eat sandwiches along the riverside. Afterwards we headed to Sunrise. The alpine meadows were in full bloom and the views of the mountain...breathless.

Mount Rainier,"March 30, 2009 - We chose the Carbon River Entrance (NW Corner) because it was the only entrance into the park that was open closest to Tacoma that time of year. You must know, however (and we knew this before going), that in 2006 torrential flooding destoyed Carbon River Road within the park and you must now park your car at the ranger station at the entrance and hike or bike to where you want to get (at this time there are no plans on fixing the road). And again just so you know, it's 3 miles from the ranger station before you get to anything. What we didn't know is that the ranger station this time of year is not always open. Our inital plan was to hike 5 miles in to see Ranger Falls and Green Lake. What we weren't counting on was the amount of snow and the number of large fallen trees that covered Carbon River Road. I did E-mail the park ahead of time and they seemed to think it would be a great hike. About 2 hours into the hike according to our GPS we had only traveled 1.9 miles and the snow was just getting deeper and deeper and it was starting to lose the fun. Knowing there was no way to make it to Green Lake we called it a day and took about a 45 minute break for lunch and play before making the 2 hour trek back to the car. This is not a hike I would recommend in the winter or early spring unless you: are familiar with walking in snow, have snowshoes, are in good physical condition, or get there first thing in the morning. Like I said it didn't start getting bad until the end of the second mile. I did read this on another review website but didn't take the warning!

There are very few people in the park, so you can take hikes on many trails (Grove of the Patriarchs for example) and not see anyone for almost an hour! It also means that there are less vehicles on the roads, so if you see a view that you enjoy, you're able to stop and quickly take a picture. Although it was September, the weather was perfect!

We stopped a few times along the journey up and once walked down in the riverbed and across a bridge which we liked. The parking at Jackson Visitor Center was a - nightmare - but we were there on a weekend, so I'm guessing that was part of the problem. We ate at the restaurant in the visitor center and the food hit the spot, even though they don't serve french fries which we had a hankering for. The lights inside caught our attention as they are skis and ski poles. They are building a new visitor's center in Paradise, and I believe the old one is closing. We had no idea that Mt. Rainier had glaciers on it and you could see the blueish tint to them which we thought was really neat. We were there on a very hot day and on our way back down the mountain, we stopped at a point where the water was running off and filled our water bottles!

I felt compelled to review the National Park Inn at Longmire Washington.If you have seen our review as mentioned above, you will note that we are from Alabama and are avid backpackers, especially during the winter. Therefore, we don't expect 4 star accomodations when we come into ""town"". Back in late 2/08 & early 3/08 we traveled to Mt. Rainier. We spent 3 days and 2 nights camping on 17 plus feet of snow after hiking approx. 7-8 miles.We decided to go to the National Park Inn on the last night to clean up on the last night. for the flight home The restaurant was great, the room was adequate for a national park and the staff was very friendly.Also, hats off to the staff at Whittaker Mountaineering in Ashford (just outside the park) for their help in renting snowshoes for the aforementioned trek. Also, the park ranger at Longmire was very informative and thorough.This whole trip gets a 5.Milton","March 28, 2008",Great Time,38,Birmingham,5
Mount Rainier,"In August 2006 - We decided on the spur of the moment to see Mt. Rainier on our way home from Seattle to Portland. We are so glad we did! The weather was perfect, which helped. Just the drive alone to Paradise had tons of great views. They are currently doing construction on Paradise Lodge, so parking on a sunny weekend was difficult and frustrating. There were lots of wildflowers throughout the meadows. We took a short trail north of the visitors center and saw amazing views of the mountain, the glacier and the waterfalls. We didn't have time to stay long (wish we could've), but it was still a great place to visit!","August 8, 2006",Beautiful!,21,"Portland, Oregon",5
Mount Rainier,"We planned a trip to Olympic National Park. After booking our rooms, some freinds told us about Mt. Rainier. The pictures looked like ""paradise"" so we decided to spend one night at Cougar Rock campground then go see Paradise. We are from Florida. We arrived after dark and when the sun came up in the morning our jaws dropped. The views are breathtaking. The waterfalls and views are unbelievable. We woke at dawn so we beat the crowds to Paradise. We were there in July but were able to take a short hike up the mountain and see snow. Our kids couldn't believe it! Our only regret is that we didn't have more time to spend there. It is worth the drive! We hope to return to spend more time at Mt. Rainier.","August 25, 2004",More beutiful than the pictures!,137,"Tampa, Florida",5
