Bryce Canyon National Park,"I visited for a day in early Oct. My wife and I was on a 10 days US Southwest roadtrip.Bryce Canyon N P was one of the highlights. We soent a day, and it was needed. We walked the combined Queens and Canyon loop, which was fantastic. And we drove the rim trip, which had some very nice viewpoints.In all a fantastic experience","October 19, 2019",A must see !,145,"Trondheim, Norway",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This, and Arches, were by far our favorite parks in UT. We stopped at the visitor center, got a feel for what the park was about and then drove to the far end of the scenic lookouts and worked our way back, with all of the pull offs now on our right side. Each stop was more amazing than the last and we just loved it. Our final stop was the Sunset overlook and it was absolutely amazing. If you have the ability to hike this would make an amazing hike down in the canyon between the spired rock formations. If you are going to UT to see the amazing rock formations, this park is a must see.","October 18, 2019",Fantastic,68,"Osseo, Minnesota",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Had a great time driving to Bryce from Las Vegas. It was a 4hr drive, 200miles from Vegas. Cost $30 dollars to go into the park but if you want to see other parks it’s best you get the $80 card that allows you to enter all the parks in the USA.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce is unusual due to geological structures called hoodoo. The red, orange, and white colors of the rocks provide spectacular views. By driving around the rim of the ""canyon"" you can stop at various viewpoints and take a short walk (usually only a few hundred yards) to see the amazing sites.An interesting option is to take a horseback ride down to the floor of the ""canyon"" and see the hoodoos from the bottom looking up.","October 17, 2019",Interesting place,75,North Carolina,4
Bryce Canyon National Park,Absolutely stunning scenery. Nowhere else in the world to match this. A couple of days will see the most of the area unless you intend to hike.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This was our first trip to Utah and Bryce Canyon was on the top of my list. The hoodoos were ""out of this world""! I thought we were on another planet!We took in the Rainbow Tour in the morning and this free tour was just awesome!Our driver /tour director was very knowledgeable and pleasant. He walked with us various stops and shared the history of the area. We visited Bryce Canyon in earlyOctober and was blessed with fall colors!!! The quaking aspens were so beautiful andadded a new dimension to our visit to Bryce Canyon. If you go to Bryce Canyon, taking the Rainbow Tour is a must.........A most memorable experience!","October 16, 2019",An Exhilarating Experience at Bryce Canyon,27,"Hilo, Hawaii",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"All the national parks in Utah are different. But, this one has hoodoos! Of course, great hikes. Fun photo opportunities. If you like to horseback ride you must do the one offered at Bryce Canyon Lodge. May be the best trail ride I have ever done. If possible stay at the Lodge. The overly tacky ""Rubyville"" outside the park leaves a bad taste. It could have been done right--I have seem it, but this--in every way is just terrible. Tourist tacky.","October 16, 2019","Bryce Canyon--""Rubyville"" Terrible",0,,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Lots of different hikes for different ages and strengths including strenuous. Plenty of young, elderly and friendly tourists. Popular trails like the popular view points and Navajo Loop/Queens Garden had lots of tourists. Longer tougher trails less people. Weather was mid 50s in midday and early morning and late evening low 30s but wasnt bad during hikes felt warm after hiking an hour. Great views and trails clearly marked. Plenty of bathrooms. Not alot of dining selections in area so pack snacks. Great for a weekend stop. ","October 15, 2019",Columbus Weekend Adventure,7,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We were driving by from Kanab on the way to Salt Lake and we had never been, so we stopped. $35 to get into park, but it was well worth it. Glad we decided to go.

I would love to hike down some of the trails and see the view from the bottom of the canyons. It is truly glorious.,"October 14, 2019",Breathtaking views,207,"Eldridge, Iowa",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"I went to Bryce Canyon to observe and photography nature's wonder. It was awesome and in Oct the temps were nice and the crowds were not bad. I could actually get parking at most viewpoints, But, I would highly recommend using the Bryce shuttle that you boards in the town outside of Bryce NP. All the viewpoints on the regular shuttle are worth stopping at and the shuttle comes by every 10-12 min. You can also hike allow the canyon rims to the next stop. There is also a special free park shuttle at 9am & 130pm with a tour guide that takes you down the other road to rainbow point for a 3+hr ride, but you have to signup for this with 48 hrs of the departure, great tour. some of those viewpoints are crowded for parking.","October 14, 2019",Wonder palce to visit & photograph,40,"Eagle River, Alaska, United States",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Followed up our Zion NP visit with a trip to Bryce, don't miss this gem. This beautiful park is so different from Utah's other NP's, it's a must see. Enjoy hiking around the canyons many trails/viewpoints ""up top"" or venture down in the canyon. Be sure to allow plenty of time for the lower hikes, they require a bit more time but are definitely worth it. There is a lot more to see if you drive yourself in at least once, many of the views are not on the NP shuttle.","October 14, 2019",Utah must see!,8,"Naples, Florida",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"The starting point for a visit should be the Visitor Center. Here you will find information at the Ranger Help Desk, exhibits, a 22-minute film and maps and souvenirs.Bryce is not a single canyon unlike say the Grand Canyon. It is a series of huge amphitheatres carved into a high plateau. They are huge and are filled with irregularly eroded spires of rock called hoodoos. Bryce contains the largest concentration of hoodoos in the world.Over two million visitors come to Bryce National Park each year, most in the March to October period. Every visitor spends at least some time marvelling at the views from the four main viewpoints and walking the trails between them. I strongly suggest the 1.6 kilometer paved trail along the edge of the amphitheatre between Sunset and Sunrise Points. Then you need to venture down into the hoodoos via the Navajo Loop Trail or the Queens Garden Trail.Accommodation within the park is limited to the rustic Lodge at Bryce Canyon and the North and South campgrounds which are near the Lodge and the Visitor Center.","October 14, 2019",Fascinating National Park,6,"Queensland, Australia",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,We were on a 12 day trip thru the Southwest National Parks. We did the Queen’s Garden hike which is fabulous and not to be missed!,"October 13, 2019",Favorite hike,27,"Lancaster, Pennsylvania",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Spend 2 full days here in early October. Just a bit cold in the morning at 19 degrees but warmed up to the 60s in the afternoon. We dressed in layer and put extra clothes in the back pack as the day wore on. We went to the park early so we were able to find parking near the Sunrise point. After that we used the shuttle to return to our car.Best hikes: Queens garden from Sunrise point to the bottom. Then return to Sunset point via the Navajo train via WALL street. Wall street was amazing especially coming from the bottom. We did all the rim hikes and took the bus to get back. Hidden Gem. Just outside the park entrance road, Mossy Caveis 4 mi East on Hwy 12.This is a short scenic hike to a waterfall.","October 13, 2019",More than expected,52,Florida,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,Amazing location stunning views. You will need your camera. The sites are better than you can imagine. Walking around this location is a must.,"October 13, 2019",What a view,5,,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"At Bryce, visitors arrive at the rim of the canyon and look down. And what a sight ... from sorts of perspectives, views of magically colored cliffs and formations , spited, cut-out curtains of eroding rock. There are trails heading upward from the forested rim, or down, if you dare, into the canyon. The colors change with the light. My little granddaughter loves the hoodoos - the eroding formations that wind up looking like rock statues. Summer rains, freezing at night and expanding cracks in the rock, help erode these formations rapidly as geology goes. We tried out several moderate walks with stunning views. Bryce is not as crowded as Zion, but you still need to plan at least 6 months in advance for lodging. If you go to any Utah parks, make sure you see this one, too!","October 12, 2019",Truly breathtaking,47,"Annandale, Virginia",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Visited a couple of America's National and State parks recently, must say that Bryce was my least favourite and a bit overrated!You get some nice views from Bryce/Inspiration Point but otherwise there's not an awful lot to it.. The walks are a bit mediocre and not all that scenic.. good for an afternoon or morning but not worth the entrance fee.","October 12, 2019",Very pretty but slightly overrated!,18,"Wellington, New Zealand",2

I just got a new camera and wow, I didn’t know where to turn nex! Lots of hiking trails and beautiful views everywhere! It was a bit chilly...9 degrees on Oct 11 when we were there. It did warm up during the day. Being a Florida Gal I was a bit chilly to say the least. But it was worth every minute!","October 12, 2019",Wonderful experience,98,"Fort Myers, Florida",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We just did a hiking roadtrip to Colorado, Utah, and Arizona and I have to say Bryce Canyon in UT was my favorite one of all of our hikes. No matter which angle/point you are viewing the canyon from it is truly breathtaking! I suggest hopping on the free shuttle riding to the top and hiking down. The bus will stop at each point of interest so don't worry if your not really a hiker. If you choose not to hike all the way down at least hike sunset point down into the caverns....you won't be disappointed....it is so AMAZING!!!","October 12, 2019",Beautiful Experience,4,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is a gorgeous park that is most known for the hoodoos, the column-like rock formations seem throughout the park.

Bryce Canyon National Park,I have never in my life seen anything as beautiful as the hoodoos in Bryce Canyon! It will absolutely take your breath away!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We loved this park. The views were wonderful, marvelous, tremendous, breathtaking, etc. There are great walks almost anyone can take.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"If you are arriving by car you dont need to take shuttle bus, however the park offers it. Just drive to Sunset point, arrive earli, parking places are limited. Take the Navajo loop start your tour to Wall street and come up from Two bridges this is better than the opposite way. The canyon and tgis trail was really the best view what ever I experienced.","October 9, 2019",Very nice trail scanic view,1,,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Great Park with lots of private property nearby to pay for the locals living expenses. It’s sad that they commercialize our nation’s parks like this. But it is what it is! The park itself is gorgeous. No need to rent a four wheeler, helicopter, or half dead horse. Get out and enjoy up close. Tour as much as you are able to while you can. Lots of sights are very close to the bus stops. Leave your car in town and don’t waste time looking for parking spots in the park. We saw lots of 70 and 80 year olds enjoying the sights. Lots of geology in the Big 5 so try to get on a Ranger Lead Tour for the best inside information. Make sure to visit the Visitor Center for the movie. Enjoy!","October 9, 2019",Exceptional Park,105,"Lake Havasu City, Arizona",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"The United States is blessed with stunning national parks and monuments. We need to ensure we do everything possible to protect them. Bryce Canyon is at the top of the list in terms of beauty. You are currently able to drive a personal vehicle through the park, and this always makes visits more convenient. The park is small but mighty. We did it once...and want to go back and do it all over again!","October 9, 2019","Hike if You Can, Go Even if You Cannot Hike - Stunning",18,Kentucky,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"I knew this would be a good site to see canyon views. However,the views were totally amazing. The varied stone and colors of the formations were often breathtaking. The site is worth a trip, even if it is your only destination in Utah. That being said there are many other sites worth visiting in Utah.","October 9, 2019",Incredible views.,1,"Lansing, Michigan",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is absolutely spectacular! We've seen the Grand Canyon and Zion National Park but Bryce took our breaths away! There is so much to see and hike. The rock formations are very colorful, interesting and so different from anything we've seen before.We picked up sandwiches in a country store near Sunset Point for lunch that day.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"A great place to hike, bike, or just ride the bus and take in the views. We rode up from Red Canyon and into the park up to Inspiration Point. (12.5 miles). Then hiked the Rim trail, Navajo Gardens and the Queen trail, the back to Red Canyon on the Bikes. WHAT A GREAT DAY. October is a good time to go because the weather is nice and the crowds a bit diminished.","October 7, 2019",Second best park in America (after Zion),10,"Tucson, Arizona",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,easy to trave around and stop unlike some of the parks. Bryce Point has nice short walks and beautiful views of the surrounding hoodoos and rock formations. Sunrise point walk to sunset point is about 30 minutes and wll worht it. Saw huge Elk sitting next to boardwalk by the petroglyphs. This was my favorite of the 5 parks we saw this trip.,"October 7, 2019",wonderful spectacular views - well worth the time,5,"Pittsford, New York",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is a popular park. If going, do your homework and plan for that. For us it meant parking in town and taking a shuttle to the park. That way, we didn't have to fight for a parking spot at either the visitors center or at any of the scenic overlooks. Plus the shuttle is free so why not!!Speaking of scenic overlooks, the park is rich with magnificent views at every stop. If you HAVE to chose to only go to a few of our national parks, make sure Bryce is on your list.","October 6, 2019",Overwhelming Scenery!,57,"Topeka, Kansas",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We were at Bryce Canyon National Park on this late September Sunday and the park was busy. We used a National Parks Pass that allowed us to enter Bryce Canyon National Park for free. The regular price is $30 per vehicle.Our first stop was the Ranger Station/ interpretive Centre which is about 100 yards pass the entrance on the right. There is no parking here. You will have to do a short drive pass the centre, turn left and park in the lot and a short walk back to the centre. Sunset Point and the Rim Trail were our first stops after the info centre. Sunset Point has the short paved Rim trail hike near the parking lot. The trail is similar to the Grand Canyon Rim trail hike on a paved trail but much shorter.Queens Garden TrailWe started on the Queens Garden trail (to the left on the Rim Trail) going clockwise on a gentle downhill. The trail here is mostly compact dirt and gravel with some exposed rocks. There is a lot of amazing scenery of the rock formations with lots of photo ops. One of the highlights here is the Queen Victoria formation, a rock formation that looks that looks like her profile.Navajo Loop TrailAdjoining the Queens Garden Trail is the Navajo Loop Trail. We joined the trail and hiked up the “Wall Street” trail. This trail is through a canyon “slot” with steep walls on both sides. The trail itself is compact dirt and gravel with some man-made steps and short switchbacks near the top. The hardest part of the trail is going up, about a 1/4 - 1/3 mile climb. It may be difficult for those with mobility and / or cardio issues but not impossible. We joined the Navajo Loop trail part way through the Queens Garden Trail and missed the Thors Hammer rock formation. Our loop of the trail was about (Queens Garden and partial Navajo Loop) was about 5 kilometers / 3.1 miles. If you want to do the complete Navajo Loop Trail and go downhill to start (probably the easier option), go to Sunset Point and start with “Wall Street” section.Inspiration PointAt Inspiration Point there are 3 viewpoints with the first one being paved and closest to the parking lot. There are very short hikes, maybe 200-300 meters, for the next 2 viewpoints on a compact dirt and gravel trail. There are washrooms and a bus stop here. Inspiration Point has parking for about 60 cars.Bryce PointBryce Point has a short paved trail with parking for about 75 cars. This is also a bus shuttle stop. There are some nice views and worth a 15-20 minute stop. Natural Bridge Viewpoint has parking for 40+ vehicles and is worth a 5-10 minute stop.Agua Canyon Viewpoint has parking for about 12 vehicles and is worth a 5 minute stop. Rainbow Point is at the end of all the sites. There are parking spots for 100 plus vehicles and there are washrooms here. There is a short paved trail that offers views of the Canyon. We headed off to the right and the Bristlecone loop, an out and back with a loop about 1.6 km (1 mile) in length. The trail consists of mostly compact dirt and gravel. From the first lookout to the second one is uphill and about 200 meters.If you have visited the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon National Park is comparable and even better according to my fellow hikers; not because of the size but the fact you are walking on the canyon floor with amazing rock formations surrounding you. I would rate the overall experience 5 out of 5.Notes &Tips: • At the interpretive centre there are washrooms and a gift shop. Pick up your park map here. Plan your visit on the internet before you get here so you’ll know in advance what you want to see. • The park “drive” is basically an out and back route on a paved road with our first “Point” being Sunrise and the last one being Rainbow / Yovimpa. There were a few other viewpoints that we did not stop at • In total we spent about 6-7 hours in the park • Bring suntan lotion and wear a hat. During the last week of September it was still hot and sunny. • I would recommend a good pair of trail runners or day hikers and definitely no flip-flops! • Pack a picnic lunch and bring water. There are picnic tables, washrooms and water near Bryce Canyon Lodge. Bryce Canyon Lodge has a restaurant. • There was a good mix of old and young people with lots of seniors (65+). Some people were using hiking poles but in my opinion they are not necessary depending upon your age. • Parking spots may be in short supply depending upon when you arrive and the time of the season. We were there during the last week of September and it was busy but were lucky to get a parking spot near Bryce Canyon Lodge and it was a very short walk to the Rim Trail. If the parking lot is full you will have to park in the overflow lots and take the free shuttle buses to the various viewpoints. The free shuttle buses stop at all the viewpoints throughout the park. • We saw Steller’s Jay birds and a chipmunk on our hikes • There are camp grounds inside the park • We were on our first day of our 13 day Nevada-Arizona-Utah trip. We were off to Moab and Goblin Valley next. Other national parks we visited on this trip included Arches, Canyonlands and Zion. See my reviews. • State and private parks we visited included Goblin Valley, Monument Valley, Lower and Upper Antelope and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area. See my reviews. • Buy an annual pass if you plan to visit more than 3 national parks in the next 12 months.","October 4, 2019",Amazing! - 5 out of 5 rating,781,"Richmond, Canada",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We have visited many National Parks in America but this one took our breath away.The hoodoos are simply stunning. There are many viewpoint and you really need to spend a day here to see as many as possible. You can drive your car through the park or take the free shuttle.Trying to narrow down which are the best viewpoints is difficult but the general consensus is that the first four (Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration and Bryce) are must sees. I would also recommend Rainbow, Natural Bridge and Fairyland.Zion is great too but honestly if you could only visit one of them I would pick Bryce over Zion.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Very nice park with many trails to hike of all skill levels. You do not have to hike to see the sites just drive along the rim trail and stop at the many scenic viewpoints to have your breath taken away.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We love visiting national parks and Bryce is certainly one of our favorites. The canyon itself can be seen almost entirely from the comforts of the car . There is an 18 mile scenic drive which take you to all of the points. Our favorites were Inspiration Point, Natural Bridge, Ponderosa , and Bryce Point. This drive took us 3-4 hours with plenty of photo stops and short hikes along the rim.Even though you can see the park by car, we highly recommend taking at least a couple of hikes along the well maintained trails. Some suggestions if you are short on time like us :1. Navajo trail ( our favorite): moderate, at least see the first few sections and switchbacks.2. Rim trail : easy3. Queens Garden : easiest descent into the canyon, but we liked the Navajo descent more. Navajo and Queens Garden can be combined to do a loop.The highlight of the trip was the night sky . We cannot recommend this enough. Please go to one of the points , and just look up. You will see the glorious milky way and a million stars. All in all, we highly recommend this park.","September 30, 2019",One of my favorites,8,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This park really needs to be on your bucket list. The pictures you see and take are beautiful, but you really need to be there. We ignored the advice to take the shuttle bus, and used the GyPSy app with our car. This app used GPS to coordinate what the narrator was saying and what we were looking at. We were given directions for our travel once we neared the park, and told what order would be best for viewing. You may be led to believe that you must do hiking as part of your experience. While hiking could well make a better experience, just viewing is other wordly and quite spectacular.","September 30, 2019",Photography doesn't cut it!,10,"Buffalo, New York",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,We were just in Bryce Canyon last weekend and it was magnificent.All the views were beautiful and it’s an easy walk.

It’s worth a visit,"September 30, 2019",Bryce Canyon,0,"San Gabriel, California",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"The free shuttle was the best way to see the park, for us. The bus picked you up from any of 15 points and took you in a loop to the most prominent places like Bryce and Inspiration Points, Sunrise and Sunset Points, as well as the Lodge, VIsitor Centre and the various hotels in the area.Thee Visitor Centre will give you directions to get the best of your time here. There are ranger programs. The Bryce Amphitheatre Rim has the best views and you can go hiking inside on several different trails. Or you can do the scenic drive which is 18 miles long on your own or on the free 3 hr Rainbow Bus Tour but for this you need reservations.We saw some amazing rock formations, thousands of hoodoos and sandstone cliffs that have eroded over 70 million years to give you an awesome spectacle.","September 29, 2019",An amazing spectacle,403,"Thornhill, Canada",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We did the Peek A Boo Loop and Navajo trail hikes here and they were both incredible! The shuttle system is great. We also visited Inspiration Point and Sunset Point with the shuttles. One of the things I noticed about Bryce was how accessible it is. We are not disabled, but I noticed that nearly all of the viewpoints had paved areas and parking very close to the viewpoints for those with mobility issues. I loved it. I felt so lucky that I was able to attend an astronomy program after dark at the lodge and then do a telescope viewing of our planets and galaxies at Sunset Point. The rangers were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable during this. I could have talked to them all night. We also especially loved the rangers directing traffic at the visitors center.

We also drove along the rim with lots of stops along the way to experience the sights. Sunset and Sunrise are especially powerful. We were lucky to be there for both a full moon, and when the moon rise was at the same time as sunset.

It might not in size be as big as the Grand Canyon, but ecstatically more beautiful with all the hoodoos in different shapes and sizes.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is a must visit beside Zion NP. It's just a couple hours drive from Zion via the beautiful Hwy 9 Zion Scenic Drive and Hwy 89, with so many winding roads and unbelievable views of Zion NP. Don't forget to take some pictures with a couples of drive-thru Arches before reaching Bryce Canyon NP entrance. There are 4 main viewpoints: Bryce point, Inspiration point, Sunset point and Rainbow Point. IMO, a MUST SEE are Bryce Point and Rainbow Point. - At the Bryce Point you can view the famous Bryce Amphitheater (it carries the park's name, so most of the highlights are here), whereas countless spires of rock columns also called Hoodoos that carved into the canyon, they formed into an unbelievable views, an unbelievable place on earth. So unique and mind-boggling.- Rainbow Point is the last viewpoint of the park, it's also at the highest elevation (9,115' to be exact). The panoramic view of the whole Bryce canyon is here. It's just BREATHTAKING. Trust me. You don't want to miss this. - FYI, if you like to hike, there are trails in each viewpoint, they also have trails that connect between viewpoint, ranging from easy to moderate. Spend at least a day at the park to enjoy all the best that Mother Nature has given us. Hope this review will help you with some basic info. Now, go explore and enjoy one of the Mighty Five.

Most of it can be seen without a guided tour, which is what we did. Went up to the end of the road and worked our way back, which was a great way to beat the crowds. Once back at the visitors center, there is a shuttle that will take you to the parts you can't see by car, and the run frequently.The vistas a views are literally other-worldly. If you want to know what a canyon would look like on anther planet, you don't need to imagine it, as you can see one of Mother Nature's true spectacles, right here on Earth.

Trail gets you INTO the Canyon, a sense of slot canyons, twisted trees, etc. I have a great fear of heights, but this trail was fine. Well surfaced, but not a wheelchair granny trail. After the trail, drive to end of park road, enjoying several scenic stops. One could spend one or several days here. Noted a nice, long bike trail outside the park. Also an extraordinary state park with intense red formations outside park.","September 23, 2019",Our great national parks,158,Idaho,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We just returned from 3 wonderful and amazing days in Bryce Canyon! Arriving in late afternoon, we started our experience at Bryce with the Mossy Cave hike and a visit to Fairyland. The following day to get a scope of the park, we did the 18 mile scenic view points, and the Ampitheatre (Inspiration, Sunset, Sunrise, and Bryce Points). The next morning, when crowds were low, we did the Wall Street hike from Sunset Point to the Queens Garden, up to Sunrise Point, and back to Sunset. We followed this with a sunset hike from Sunset Point, down Wall Street, and did the Navajo Loop. The incredible formations, Thor's Hammer and the 3 Sisters, can be viewed at the end of this loop. We highly recommend the Rustler's Restaurant in Tropic. Not only is the food great, but owner, Dallas Clark, is the first genuine cowboy that we have met. He heards 250 head of cattle that he has raised from Tropic to Page every November through back country.","September 21, 2019",3 Wonderful and Amazing Days in Bryce Canyon!,21,"Bloomington, Indiana",5

We drove around other sites and was finally allowed into the best parts of the park. If you go, you might consider taking the free shuttle. They will drop you off to take pictures, hike, and etc. Shuttles run every so many minutes. I bet I took over a hundred pictures. We both throughly enjoyed it.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We liked Bryce Canyon as it isn't as crowded as Zion or the south rim of the Grand Canyon. Spend some time, especially at sunrise and sunset to view the changing light and colors on the hoodoos. Bryce Canyon is famous for its worldly unique geology. The erosional force of frost-wedging and the dissolving power of rainwater have shaped the colorful limestone rock of the Claron Formation into bizarre shapes including slot canyons, windows, fins, and spires called “hoodoos.” When we were there we took a horseback ride into the bottom of the canyon. Fabulous! We stayed in the historic cabins close to the rim. Highly recommend!","September 20, 2019",Moosie on the move!,15,"Houston, Texas",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"First of all, it's not really a canyon but the hoodoos are amazing! Fortunately, the Navajo Loop trail was reopened in June so you could descend into the canyon - go early in the day for the most amazing experience. For those who are challenged, the paved path from Sunrise Point to Sunset Point is easy to maneuver. The rim trail from Bryce Point to Inspiration Point and then to Sunset Point, also provides outstanding views. If you do use the bus system, they only go as far as Bryce Point. To see the complete park, you will need to drive your own vehicle.

The only walk which is accesible with the stroller is between sunset and sunrise they say. But we did Queens garden, Navajo loop and sunset to inspiration point with the stroller as well. Sometimes a bit steep and stoney but as far as we’re concerned it was good (make sure you take the 2 bridges side of Navajo, we did the other side and than you do have to carry the last couple of hundred meters).We stayed at ruby’s inn rv and the shuttle stops there as well so you can park and leave your rv.Nb don’t go to inspirationpoint for sunset, it’s worthless for the sun is at the other side.","September 17, 2019",Gorgious trails,42,"Volendam, The Netherlands",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"My wife and I visited Bryce Canyon NP while traveling Utah.She really wanted to go hike through the hoodoos! (Those are the pillar looking rock formations)This park and generally all of the NP's we visited while in Utah, was kind of small. Not sure exactly how big but I think from.the entrance to the end, it was like 18 miles? First day we arrived, we took a ride all the way to the end and made our way back out. We didn't hike that day, just drove and stopped and took pictures. The next day we hiked! We did the Queens Garden Trail to the Navajo Trail, through Wall St. What an incredible park this is. The views were other worldly. Just like at Zion NP, Bryce has some switchbacks. Make sure you bring some snacks and plenty of fluids with. Even being in the canyon, it gets warm out there. Parts of the Queens Garden Trail went through the rock! They cut out little tunnels for you to go through. It was a really awesome place to hike. Probably our favorite.We went down another trail, not sure of the name, but it took you past Thor's Hammer and other sites. We were dog tired by that point. Make sure to pay attention to the elevation gain for which ever trail you're doing. A good thing to do is to check in at the welcome center and talk with the rangers.

There are so many different and varied hikes available, you will be busy for a long time just figuring out which hike to enjoy next. During the summer season Bryce does get crowded. Not as bad as Zion or Yosemite, but still very crowded. If you aren’t camping in the park, the really is no reason to fight the crowded parking lots found at the vistas and trailheads. An excellent bus shuttle system runs throughout the park and will get you anywhere you need to go. Park outside the park and hop on the shuttle, this saving your patience and preserving your peace of mind. Fabulous pizza by the slice at the General Store. Huge and affordable , one slice is enough.

After arriving at Rainbow Point and taking in the view, you stop at several other viewing areas on the way back. There's a little bit of walking, but nothing strenuous - at most about 200 yards.

We already had a National Parks annual pass so it did not cost us to get in or park. The pass costs $80 but well worth it if you plan to visit several of them. We dropped into the visitor centre but had already been given maps so quickly headed out to catch the free shuttle. You don’t have to do this but parking and navigating in the amphitheater can be difficult at peak times. We hopped off the bus at sunrise & walked the hoodoos to sunset point. It’s spectacular but can be hot so take water,suncream etc. We were limited in time but there are other trails that you can do. We then went back to the van for lunch before setting off on the scenic drive. We opted to drive to the furthest point & stop at the view points on the way back as it was easier to turn in/out.Best advice is to get there early & do any walking while still cool.","September 10, 2019",Happy Hoodoo spotting,23,United Kingdom,5

The formations are amazing, the exploration of the park is facilitated by shuttle buses that go to most places, the paved trails, the orientation movie at the Visitor Center, and last but certainly not least, the ranger talks. If you don't want to drive, you can park about 2 miles north of the park entrance on Hwy 63, then ride the shuttle into the main park area.

The park is full of Hoodoos which are pinkish limestone columns. There are hiking trails, some accompanied by rangers to go down into the park. The one I liked most was the ""Queen's Garden"" (hoodoo like a statue of Queen Victoria.)Most of the walks from one viewpoint to another are proteced with fence but thereare still some areas which are not. Be careful and don't go too near the edge.","August 31, 2019",Visiting from Switzerland,26,"Prangins, Switzerland",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,Unbelievably beautiful in every way. No comparison to Grand Canyon but that’s not a disservice to them. It’s just a completely different experience.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Our visit to Bryce Canyon National Park was great. The rock formations went on and on and they were absolutely fascinating. We couldn’t take enough photos.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is one of my favorite national parks. Seeing all the glorious colors of the hoodoos is like no other place I've ever seen. Get there early in the summer to beat the crowds, even before the park officially opens, you can get in. Inspiration Point is amazing - do the walk to the point. The hike at Sunset Point Overlook is awesome. You travel down into the canyon and will walk between the huge red rock into what appears to be like a slot canyon. You'll then walk out of the more narrow area onto a trail that traverses through part of the canyon's floor and then takes you back up to Sunset Point again. Note, bring water; wear tennis shoes at the least, and if you are not used to climbing any elevation, just take it slowly. You'll get there. It's not a hard hike; just coming back up will give you some elevation. Lots of overlooks in the park and lots of trails if you have more time.

If you're wondering where to go and what to do, don't worry because the map they give you explains how long the walk is and how strenuous it is so you can alter it for your needs. In addition, the free shuttle buses are there to take you to most of the sites and the horse ride is also another option (extra cost). Lastly there's a special shuttle called the Rainbow shuttle that you need to reserve ahead of time and it's free with a ranger to guide you on your tour.","August 26, 2019",God's creation,57,"New York City, New York",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,This is our 3rd time coming to Bryce Canyon. it’s a must do if you have never been! Amazing views! We have always stayed on the rim trail and saw it from the top in the past. This visit we hiked the Navajo trail down in the canyon and loved it! The Navajo trail is just little over a one mile hike. So glad we did it. We were worried about the hike out of the canyon but it was not as bad as we thought. We went down on the Wall Street side and went up on the other side. The switch backs can be challenging however for 2 people not in excellent shape that are 51 & 60 it was not all that bad. The views were totally different than from above and not at all what we expected. We were so glad we did this hike! Make sure to where comfortable walking shoes. Water might be needed on a hot day. The breeze in the canyon was great when we were there and the temp was 82 in mid August. Excellent weather for this hike. We barely broke a sweat.,"August 17, 2019",A must do!!!,40,"Springfield, Ohio",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Quite simply this place needs to be seen to be believed! Even my teenagers were struck speechless for a while! Advice is to go as early as you can to beat the crowds and the heat of the day. We arrived 9am.. drive to Sunset Point, walk North along the rim to Sunrise point & then follow the traildownwards. Whole thing takes just over an hour if you take it slowly.It’s a gentle slope down with stunning views. The reason to do the loop this way around is that it is easier to climb up a steep slope than to walk down down it. At the end of the loop you get 2 options.. zone to to climb back up to the right and the other is to go left towards Wall Street. Do this one! It’s steep but in the shade and stunning! Our sins did the other route since it was slightly shorter but they said it was sunny. No words describe how stunning this place is... here are some photos. Then drive along the very end of the park, Yovimba point. Don’t. Other stopping stand if the vistas on the way there; save that for the trip back when they’re all in the right hand side, so much easier to drive in and out of.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Simply stunning place with so much to see and do. Tips : The car park at the end of the road through the Park gets very busy and this was the only real bottleneck. Choose a quieter time. We found it better to drive straight there and then work our way back through all the scenic stop off points.The treks are a lot easier than we anticipated before we got there. We did the busy Queens Garden/Navajo Loop trail followed by the Tower Bridge trail which was much quieter. Park in the Sunset Car Park and take the stunning short walk to Sunrise Point to start either trek. The treks are amazing, a real lifetime experience.I would recommend taking picnics with you. Food in the Park is not great.Check the weather as lightening can be quite dangerous. We saw a number of strikes around the top of the rim which, whilst spectacular, were quite scary.Well marked stop off points give you good views, many of which are surprisingly different. Bryce Visitor Centre is extremely busy and the car park is a nightmare. Lots of unsupervised, over-excited children made it quite dangerous.

Pulling up to the visitor centre you feel like you are in a fairytale wilderness as wild deer roam the grasslands.

Finish off at Sunrise or Sunset point at the end of the day to see the sun falling below the horizon. We walked part of the Queen's Garden Trail early one morning. Rated as one of the less strenuous hikes, if you are not reasonably fit you will find the hike back up quite hard.

In hindsight we should have started with the first shuttle stop and then gone forward because by the time we got there, there was no parking.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce is stunningly beautiful!! Every view point has a slightly different view & the colors are amazing! I highly recommend ""hiking the hoodoos"" - it gives you a greater appreciation for Bryce. We hiked in at Sunset point & out at Sunrise point (this meant that the hiking back up was a little less intense). It was about 3-miles round trip (including the rim walk back from Sunrise point to Sunset point) and we did it with our two kids (ages 7 & 10). It took a little bit more encouragement to get the 7-year old back up to the rim, but they both made it! And we got cool stickers at the Visitor's Center when we showed them our pictures of us & the little ""Hike the Hoodoos"" medallions down in the canyon. Be sure to carry water & wear hiking clothes! Parking gets pretty full at some of the main sights, so you might want to enter the park earlier in the day or may later in the day. That being said, many of the viewpoints still had room to make our quick pull-ins & pull-outs.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"The scenery in Bryce is unlike anywhere else--amazing rock formations, beautiful colors that change almost by the minute, great hiking trails, and unmatched stargazing at night. There are a half dozen hikes in each of the easy, moderate and strenuous categories just in and around the amphitheater alone, ranging from 1 mile to 8. And there are multi-day backcountry hikes as well as horseback options. And if all you can do is walk or ride a wheelchair around the paved part of the rim trail, you will count it amongs life's great experiences. At night the sky is so dark you will be blown away by how much you can see.I recommend starting at the Visitors Center and planning your day by viewing the scale topo model of the park.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We traveled to 9 national parks and for us the best one out of it was Bryce Canyon, UT.The brillant colors of pink, gray, white, chocolate cliffs were a sight to see. The hoodoo delicate formations throughout Bryce is fascinating. We took a shuttle from visitor center to Bryce Point #3 - oh what a view. we walked 2 miles to Inspiration Point #4. As you walk from each point the views keeping changing magically to reshape what you just viewed a few steps away. Then we took the shuttle to #6 and walked a mile to #8 Sunset Point, again viewing different angles of the hoodoo and spirals. The hoodoos keep breaking off and new ones begin. The colors are magnificent and breathtaking.. After we finished seeing all the four points we waited to take a free ranger tour at 1:30. This is a three hour tour our ranger guide Randy, was awesome.you can register for a free tour guide up to 7 days before you arrive and make an appointment either at 9:00 am or 1:30 pm. They only take 40 people so you can imagine it fills up quickly. I just called 7 days ahead and made the appointment.Here is where he took us: Rainbow Point, Yovimpa Point where Randy explained each stop with passion. Then he took us to Aqua Canyon, Natural Bridge, Faiirview Point, again just explaining the beauty of the Hoodoos. He took us to Fairyland Point where he showed us Snoopy sleeping on the Hoodoo.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited with children and extended family, and it was a perfect vacation. We rented a house just outside the Park entrance (10 minutes from the Visitor Center), and it was convenient and relaxing to enter the Park each day and see the sites.There were a couple of accessible walks for young children and family members with limited mobility, and there was a fairly easy walk that led down into the Canyon for unique photographs. There are a couple of different options in the park for meals, and there are also restaurants within 10 - 20 minutes from the Park entrance. The general store has a surprisingly large selection (food, hiking and first aid supplies, souvenirs, etc.) and bathrooms are easy to find throughout the park (helpful with kids).We found Bryce to be a much more pleasant experience than Zion Canyon -- not as crowded, easier to get around in the Park (no shuttle needed), more variety of hikes/walks for people with different fitness levels, and not as hot in July.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is a true wonder of nature. The massive rock forms look like stalagmites and are as bizarre as they are beautiful. They run through the “amphitheatre” - the basin form of the canyon and are in stripes of colour from the deepest browns and reds to pale golds.The National park is extremely well run. There is no access to the many view points into the canyon for RVs, but you can park up and there is an efficient hop-on, hop-off bus service that runs a route around these vistas.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Of all the places our family visited in southern Utah, Bryce is the most unique. There are the ubiquitous red and white sandstone cliffs, but at Bryce they are wind and water sculpted into fantastic shapes and towers. After visiting the visitor center and speaking to a ranger, park your car and take the free shuttle; they are easy, convenient and allow you to take in the scenery. As a plus, the drivers are a wealth of knowledge they gladly share. Based on our conversation with the bus driver, we decided to hike the Rim Trail from Inspiration Point past Sunset Point to Sunrise Point. We then hiked into the canyon by the Queen's Garden Trail to Navajo Loop (Wall Street side, Two Bridges was closed). Hiking in that direction, as suggested by the visitor center ranger, we were mostly in the sun for the walk down into the canyon but had some shade on the way out. It is a moderate hike, around 4 miles, that took us (a 60-ish couple with bad feet and knees and 3 others around 30 year olds) several hours, but we were in no hurry and there is a lot to look at. You are walking down into the canyon (and then up and out) so there are some high areas, which doesn't thrill me, but they were manageable, and the payoff scenery was more than worth it. As you approach the switchback ascent from the canyon, enjoy the coolness, literally and figuratively, of Wall Street. Be sure to bring plenty of water and some insect repellent. If you are coming to Bryce via Rt 14 from Cedar City, be advised there is a stretch of road that is narrow, twisty and has sheer and often guard rail-less drop-offs.

The rim trail is fairly easy and obviously goes around the rim where again the whole view can change very quickly.

Of course the hikes are tough because you have to go back uphill after descending into the canyon, but with good boots and a reasonable level of fitness they are all doable.

The trip through Red Canyon was a great start to the morning. Once entering the park, (we started out on a crisp morning - 43 degrees and high winds, which we were not prepared for), we headed up to the bristlecone pine forest. At an elevation of 9100+ feet we could feel the altitude difference. There are trees in this part of the park that are reportedly more than 4000 years old. We worked our way back down, taking in all the turnouts along the way. The views are spectacular throughout the entire park. We actually tackled the tougher trails on horseback (Peekaboo, etc.) which was a great way to see the park. Because horse trails and human trails often intersect, our trail guides were frequently redirecting people back on to the correct trails. I could see if you were not paying attention how you could get turned around on certain hikes.

Be sure to see the scene at sunrise and sunset and if you like horseback riding, you'll get a chance to look out the entire ride instead of needy to watch where you step.

It’s as if you are looking down at New York skyscrapers from a drone camera high above. Luckily there is one small section of wall to lean into as you do this. I found myself calling out to three teenagers doing star jumps near the edge in a bid to get action shots. The path around the edge Is well defined but mostly unfenced.

Go early in the day to avoid some of the crowds. There are so many places to hike and enjoy views, that the people were dispersed over multiple areas and were not a hindrance.

Unlike Zion or Capitol Reef, where you are always looking up, in Bryce you look down - from four basic vista view points - much like Canyonlands. It also requires minimal walking. This is called the largest concentration of hoodoo formations anywhere on earth. We found this park very easy to navigate, as there are four basic vista view points. We took advantage of their bus service, which we found timely and very convenient, although you can drive in this park. The bus picked us up at our Best Western hotel and made a loop through the park; you need your park pass to get on the bus. It drops you off at several spots in the park, most notable the four view points and the visitor center. Be sure to see the introductory movie in the center.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We started our three week tour of Utah and Arizona with four nights at Bryce Canyon National Park. We flew in/out of Las Vegas as it was easier to get back there from Arizona, where we were ending our trip, to return our rental car. The four hour drive to Bryce was nice and easy, getting particularly scenic once we got on U.S. 89, and especially so on Scenic Byway 12. We based at a mom-n-pops motel (Bryce Canyon Pines Motel; recommend it; see my TripAdvisor review) located right on 12 and around 5-10 minutes from the park. We liked it and would definitely stay there again, as it is very convenient to the park, yet away from the cluster of other lodging establishments, and has a wonderful onsite restaurant. The park itself, with its unique rock formations and magical hoodoos should be on everyone’s list of “must-visit” places. It has a nice intimate feel, as it is Utah’s smallest national park, and one of the smallest national parks in our entire country, yet it is full of its own otherworldly grandeur. While at Bryce, we hiked the Queen’s Garden Trail, which is below the canyon rim, and also hiked the Rim Trail, from Bryce Point to Inspiration Point. Both are definitely ones to consider. We were going to do the Peekaboo Loop Trail too, but since we took the three hour mule ride with Canyon Trail Rides (also reviewed on TripAdvisor; definite attraction to consider if you have the time) that is on the same trail, we decided not to hike it as well. We also drove to Rainbow Point, the park’s highest point at over 9,000 ft. You can see the Natural Bridge along the way, so it’s worth the short ride up. It was actually snowing that day, making it all the more interesting for us Floridians. The park was very organized, both from the Visitor’s Center to the shuttle bus system; all easy to understand and navigate, and made even more so by the friendly park rangers on duty. They say to make sure to start by going into the Visitor’s Center, and you should, regardless of how much advance research you may do. We feel four nights at Bryce is just enough, at least it was for us. It also gave us time to explore a bit of the surrounding area, which is as beautiful as the canyon and park. This included some window shopping in Panguitch, a nearby town; the red rocks of Red Canyon (very cool); and additional driving on Scenic Byway 12, where we continued to the suggested overlook at mile marker 70. We can see why it is recommended.","June 16, 2019",Bryce & Its Hoodoos: A Must-Do,79,"Miami, Florida",5

I tried parking at the visitor center on my way in and there wasn't a space to be found. So I drove the main road all the way to the end and stopped at each vista on the way back towards the entrance. Most had parking available, however, Bryce Point, in particular, was quite challenging. On my first attempt, no parking spaces were open. There are 2 guards at the parking lot entrance and cones that prevent you from reentering the parking lot. I needed to drive a mile down the road and turn around to come back. On my second attempt, I found a spot. The guards made it clear that I couldn't even use my brakes to slow down in the lot to wait for someone to back out. I had to leave and drive a mile and return. The vista was spectacular and quite crowded. The Japanese tourists were the only ones going beyond the railings next to the crumbling cliff edge to get photos. All others were respectful of the boundaries. On my way out it was nearing dinner time and I stopped to walk through the lodge and see if I could park at the visitor center.

Plenty of parking and they do offer a shuttle service though not sure how that runs.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"The geology of Bryce Canyon is best characterized by hoodoos which are irregular columnar formations consisting of cylindrical spires of sandstone that are formed by the vertical erosion of sandstone cliffs.The resulting columns are capped with darker grayish erosion resistant limestone. My wife & I parked our motorhome at a designated lot near the park entrance where we boarded a convenient shuttle bus that took us to the rustic park lodge. Once in the park, hop-on-hop-off shuttle buses made it easy to travel around the park to see the various vistas. Hiking trails along the top of the canyon provide spectacular views of this enormous canyon. Bryce Canyon's vastness, depth, irregular contours, literally tens of thousand of hoodoos make it singularly beautiful and unique. The trails down into the canyon are steep and potentially very treacherous, These sloping trails descending into the bottom of the canyon are narrow, often less than 8 ft wide with no handrails so parents with toddlers and young adventuresome free spirited children will have to hold hands because their is no room for an accidental fall without rolling down steep slopes hundreds of feet below. The hikes down to the bottom will take an hour or two so each person should take a full quart of water. Even the healthiest hikers are not immune to heatstroke. Also the climb back up will be harder than the descent so factor that into the equation. But the views are spectacular and surrealistic. Bryce is unforgettable.","June 5, 2019",The best place in the US to see hoodoos,12,"Gainesville, Florida",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"What a majestic, magical place. As we sat on the shuttle bus we were in awh of this incredible place.I would suggest when you first get to the park to go to the visitor center look at the events board that shows what ranger talks are happening on which days and times, what trails are closed, and the weather report. See what interest you and put together a plan to get the most out of your time at Bryce.For us, we checked the visitor center, talked to a ranger about trails and ranger’s recommendations. We road the shuttle all the way to the end and then got off each stop to get an overview and photos. The bus comes by every 10-15 minutes. We chose 2 hikes: Peek-A-Boo to Queens , A Must Do! (To walk amongst the hoodos is amazing.) and Fairyland (the short version to Tower Bridge) and and a mountain bike ride: Thunder Mountain, we saw the short film at visitor center which was good, attended a presentation about the stars/galaxies and then went to the Telescope viewing which was excellent. Stars and galaxies are unbelievable abundant.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon was our second stop on our 12 day road trip. I could not believe the formations, the colour and the majestic beauty of this National Park. The road stops at every vantage point and if you are not into hiking you can still see the best of the park from these stops. I had wanted to walk the Navajo Trail into the Canyon but unfortunately this was closed due to damage from the severe snow of the season. Repairs were underway but regrettably not completed at the time of our visit. Moving along the road to higher elevations we came across snow which was much fun and very unexpected in mid May. Coming from tropical Australia it was such a wonderful experience. This park was absolutely amazing and a standout of all the parks we visited. The visitor centre staff were extremely helpful and had a great range in the gift shop. Will definitely put this Bryce Canyon back on the itinerary if we are lucky enough to return in the future.

If you want to know more I can answer any of your questions . Hiking and photographing in Bryce Canyon is a lifetime experience ...each day with this small group of 6 opened up every vantage point you could wish for in a place of such natural beauty. We had an added bonus of arriving at Sunrise Point the next morning to have it in snow so nothing short of amazing . The rim walk is also a must but you can join at different points along the way and there is a shuttle . Could have stayed here longer ...the reds, oranges and rock formations blew my mind and add the snow the next day and it was pure bliss.

Within 30 minutes the storm had paused, and the sun was threatening to come out from behind the clouds. We got some amazing photos. As we headed back down toward the visitors center the storm took a 90 minute break, the sun came out, and the fog drifted away. What a GLORIOS sight indeed. Big beautiful orange, red, and white rock formations sprinkled with snow. The views were incredible, the trails were muddy, the air was crisp and clean. An unbelievable experience.

We started the day at sunrise at sunrise point, a crystal clear morning saw the sun crest over the mountains and light up the hoodoos in a magical red and pink glow. We hiked down the queens garden trail, all the way to the cross with Navajo loop which was closed and then hiked out on the peak-a-boo trail. It was hard, hiking into, through and back out of the canyon but even though we were tired i could not get enough of the pink and orange hoodoos against a deep blue sky. When you see this place in the glow of the sunlight you won't believe it's real, you have to see it in person.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Our trip was a bit unconventional for a May trip going into Memorial Day weekend. We experienced a cold front, snow, sleet, rain, hail, and white-out driving. It was fairly cold the two days we were here. When the sun came out we were able to feel what the Utah son can do for warmth so that was a nice respite. We stayed in traffic and the commute to Bryce was about 25 minutes which was not terrible and had great views of its own but it was difficult when we were driving through storms because there’s ups and downs and turns a lot. We were able to see a Clear view at Bryce Canyon from sunrise pointe later in the afternoon after some storms had cleared but we only got about 3 1/2 hours of clarity before another storm rolled in which was much heavier than the first one resulting in 6 inches of snow overnight. We were glad we bit off a lot of hiking that first day because the second day a lot of things were closed due to the storm that had happened. Because of the storm we were not able to do the scenic drive down the rest of Bryce Canyon.Honestly we did almost 4 hours of hiking the first day and saw everything from the depths of the canyon all the way to the top with sunset views and didn’t really feel like we missed anything with the scenic drive so it was fine with us.","May 20, 2019",Epic and Unique,156,"Albany, New York",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"So if you are visiting Bryce Canyon be warned the facilities around are very limited and food options are basic. It would appear that everything shuts down by 9 and the restaurants choice of food is not of a high quality. Many will eat at Ruby's inn where when the bill arrives they have already added 18% gratuity , but also give you the option to tip again! Considering many of the quests are foreign travellers, wonder how many get caught out on this!!I have been told the area is owned by one family hence the lack of variety! Compared to the options available at Zion it really is dismal and needs a major improvement!!My advice is visit the beautiful canyon but stay at Zion!!Zion has much more variety and you can enjoy the whole day/night there!On our recent visit stayed at the Marriott Spring Hill suites,Springdale. lovely hotel, hence the price, however appalling breakfast, very limited food options served on paper plates and plastic utensils!!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"When you visit National Parks, I always say that was the best. Bryce Canyon in my mind is the best. It is well set up. The entrance is easy and fast. If you don’t want to drive, there is a shuttle bus that runs every 15 minutes. I suggest parking outside the park in Bryce and taking the shuttle from there. There is a lot inside the park that you can also use but it fills up quickly. The points to view the canyon also have parking lots if you want to drive. The problem is they fill quickly also. We took the shuttle and did the route from Bryce Point to Inspiration Point then on to Sunset and Sunrise Points. You can also walk the Rim Trail between the Points. I would recommend going as early as possible since it gets very busy. I won’t talk much about the views since they can be described in one word - “Spectacular”. Later in the day we drove out to Rainbow Point and did the view points in between. There was not a problem with parking. The visitor center is well staff the the rangers very knowledgeable. Lastly please follow the rules and the signs. They are there for a reason. Respect the park and what it has to offer.","May 15, 2019",Spectacular,51,"Singapore, Singapore",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"My family was on Spring Break and we decided to head to the National Parks of Utah. We were not disappointed. Bryce Canyon was amazing, a photographer's dream. The weather was beautiful the views were amazing. The trails were alot of fun, esp. for the boys. The only draw back was that quite a few of the trails were closed when we were there due to muddy conditions. I understand because they still had snow on the ground in spots. I will say though if you have small children that like to run around bring a rope to tie around them. Although the views are amazing, there aren't many guard rails on the trails, esp. the Sunrise to Sunset. I was on edge as were others, so just be careful. I really don't think there is any place like it. Book early if you want to stay in the park and go check out the views at night from the top. I hope to definitely go back some day.","May 14, 2019",One of a Kind National Park,76,"Chicago, Illinois",4
Bryce Canyon National Park,"I loved every minute I spent at Bryce and already want to go back! I did one hike down into the canyon - Queens Garden (few others were open yet in mid-April). It sure looks steep going down, but somehow coming back up was not as awful as I expected it to be. Very worthwhile. The rim trail and viewpoints were all very worthwhile. I tried to go out specifically for sunset and sunrise. In case it helps anyone else, note that the canyon aspect pushes back sunrise and pushes *forward* sunset viewing times. If sunrise, astronomically, is 7am, then the light in the canyon (coming over the edge of the canyon and down into the hoodoos) won't really get going until closer to 7:30am. Likewise, if sunset is 7pm, arriving at 6:30pm is too late - the canyon will already be out of light as the sun will have gone over the horizon of the canyon well before true sunset time. So take that into account and maybe you will have better luck than I did! (Or get some more time in bed before sunrise...)","May 13, 2019",Totally magical,336,"New York City, New York",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce National Park is amazing, don't get me wrong, but our family of four was so disappointed with this park. We went there this past March for spring break, and after a VERY long drive, we got there, and unfortunatley the park ranger (they are usually so helpful at these parks, because we go to them all of the time) DID NOT tell us that most of the park was closed due to snowfall. We paid the entrance fee, only to drive to the first stop in the park, and we couldn't go any farther. I felt like we should have received a refund. Bryce is off the beaten track, and one would like to enjoy the majority of the park when going there. I understand snow and other natural obstacles, but it would have been nice of the ranger to notify us of this situation so we could have made the decision to spend the money on the entrance fee at the time of entering. Not happy. We also, from what we did get to see, loved Zion SO MUCH MORE! Bryce is cool, and I'm glad we got to see some of the amazing hoo doos, but we recommend Zion over Bryce if you can only go to one of the parks.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I had hiked Bryce with my youngest daughter who was 22 a few years ago and was amazed at the magic of the trails, the intense beauty and the haunting hoodoos. The entire experience was a huge gift of time to share with her. This year I was blessed with the gift of going with my 81 year old father as visiting had been on his bucket list for years.I had a totally different experience and it was still wonderful. We were there two days. The first day we watched the introductory movie at the visitors center, which was interesting, took the shuttle, and slowly walked the rim trail. The weather was perfect during the last week of April. While waiting for the shuttle we were informed that there is also a free three hour tour twice a day from the shuttle service. We decided to take it the next day and were so glad we did! The driver was knowledgeable and fun and we made it to every stop. There were many snow people and even a turtle that had been created at the top! The views were phenomenal and using binoculars, we were able to even spot the North Rim of the Grand Canyon and Zion!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Six miles SE of Panguitch is the turn off for Scenic Byway 12. This takes you to the northern entrance of Bryce Canyon National Park.Bryce Canyon National Park is not a canyon, but a giant natural amphitheater. The Bryce Canyon area was settled by Mormon pioneers in the 1850s and was named after Ebenezer Bryce, who homesteaded in the area in 1874. The area around Bryce Canyon was originally designated as a national monument 1923, and was redesignated as a national park by Congress in 1928.Bryce Amphitheater, the first three miles of the park, has the most iconic and popular views of Bryce, Sunrise, Sunset, and Inspiration Points. When you enter the park at the Fee Station, you will be given a park map. This shows the locations, distances, and elevations of the viewpoints, trailheads, restrooms and whatever else you will need.Parking is ample and free and you have a choice between the free park shuttle bus, which is NOT mandatory, or driving yourself.Trailheads for the Under the Rim trail, Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration Points the Navajo Loop Trail, and the Queen's Garden all begin near here. At certain times, announced ranger led talks and hikes will begin here as well. You can also participate in the Dark Ranger Night Sky programs.While some park roads are closed in the winter, the park itself is open.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"If you are thinking about visiting Bryce Canyon, you’ve almost certainly looked at some of the pictures. The reality is even better. We visited in April, so there was still some snow around and there was a risk of storms. It also meant that the road to Rainbow Point was closed at Natural Bridge and that many of the trails were closed. We were glad we took advantage of the afternoon we arrived to visit a few of the sights and walk part of the Rim Trail because that night a wind and snow storm blew in. There wasn’t much snow, but the wind was very strong and very cold. Although we made a few attempts at venturing out, the weather was too much for us. The next morning was very cold with some wind, especially on the points, but we were able to get to some amazing vistas and to do some hiking on the Queen’s Garden Trail. Even losing a day to the bad weather, we were glad that we stopped in Bryce and will return. One suggestion: Stay in the park, if you can. The Bryce Canyon Lodge has walking access to the Amphitheater and the Rim Trail. Weather willing, that let’s you get just about everywhere, depending on how far you want to walk or hike. It also avoids the lines at the park entrance. They aren’t as bad as Arches and Zion but waiting in line is not the best way to start your day.","May 6, 2019",Even More Beautiful than the Pictures,46,California,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"After visiting Arches, Dead Horse Point, and Canyonlands, we drove on Hwy 12 to Bryce.

So the next morning we, we were in line before 0800AM at the Shuttle stop at Ruby’s, to see if we can get on the 0900AM tour. Fortunately, there were seats! So we left our car at the parking lot—no charge, loaded on the bus and enjoyed a very informative tour for 3 hours! Again—no charge, except for the park entrance fee. After this tour, we boarded the another free shuttle that stops at all the park’s sites and walked on the trails. The shuttles came very frequently and waiting was never an issue.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"The sights are closer to you and more breathtaking. Yes, it does not have the vast grandeur of the Grand Canyon, but it offers you a whole lot more details of truly outstanding rock formations. Even if you are just driving through, the views at Sunset Point and the Rim Trail are already well worth the trip. If you have more time (and energy) try some of the trails. The Queens Garden is a great initial hike. They classify it as an easy hike. However, it is not easy at all if you are out of shape. The trip to the garden is mostly downhill, so the return trip is were it gets hard.Photo Tip: Get your selfies on the return trip. You can get down to the garden without a whole lot of rest, then spend some time at the end of the switchbacks on your way back. Excellent time for selfies, while you can your breath.","April 30, 2019",Better than the Grand Canyon!,2,Maryland,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Such an amazing place! The views are wonderful and so much to see. The walking trails were awesome. We walked the loop to Queens garden loop and the walk from Bryce point to sunset.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"On my way home from my RV trip to Capitol Reef National Park and Grand Staircase/Escalante National Monument, Bryce Canyon happened to be on the route. I had seen it in Summer many years ago, but this time I was traveling in first week of April. My hope was that there would still be snow and I'm happy to report my wish was fulfilled.

When we went, the only trail open below the rim was Fairyland Loop. Good thing that was the trail we wanted to do. We purchased traction devices for our shoes in Zion. They were cheaper in the Bryce Canyon visitor center. It was still snowy and muddy in some parts but the views were spectacular. It was definitely worth the trip. The hoodoos were amazing.

First we drove the park drive to Inspiration Point for the first view into the amphitheater (gorgeous views), then drove the parkway to the Natural Bridge (beautiful), then back to the visitor's center, making stops on the way back (one place better than the other).Finally we hiked down from Sunrise point to the Queens Garden (trail), between the rocks and little tunnels dug out,a s that was the only trail open that would get us between the hoodoos. It's strenuous to come back up but definitely doable for a person with average stamina. It has beautiful views as well.Also don't forget to stop at the visitor's center for a nice movie about the park.We had a great day in this beautiful park.

We didn't realize driving in that there's actually another visitor center when you turn off of 89 onto 12, called Red Canyon Visitor Center. We stopped there and they had some great pamphlets on the area, camping spots and the scenic byway. To be fair I didn't check if they had the same pamphlets at Bryce Canyon visitor center or not. We visited April 7th and while weather changes year to year note that due to snow they still had part of the road closed and we weren't able to hike down to the hoodoos.

The staff at the visitors center is incredibly helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. Use their advice to guide you to appropriate trails. Maps and information abounds here. Take a ranger guided excursion - - there is so much to learn. Ranger Todd took us ( adults, senior citizens and children) on an amazing tour to the delight of all in attendance. He was incredibly engaging so much so that even the youngest were attentive. We all looked at the park, its geology, plants and animals with much greater appreciation after listening to Ranger Todd. He was excellent!! We took the free Rainbow Shuttle tour with Randy our driver. Randy has an amazing amount of knowledge of the park and at each stop along the way he shared his experience with us.

We were early enough that we could drive to each lookout and find parking without a problem but I suspect that it would be much harder to do that in high season.

If you want an easy hike go to Sunrise Point and walk to Sunset Point - it is an easy stroll with lots of benches along the way to sit and admire the views. We hiked the Queens Trail which is easy to moderate. Remember it takes twice as long to hike back up as it does down. Not ideal for young children as there are a few narrow bits and some serious drops. However, if you are reasonably fit you won’t have any trouble and it is really worth the effort. There are several more strenuous trails although some of them are closed at present due to snow and rock fall.

While we were disappointed that we couldn't do the hikes we had planned, we had an amazing time! We signed up for the guided snowshoe hike in the visitors center, and it essentially saved our trip! ;) It was amazing. We had so much fun, back in the quiet and still woods, snowshoe hiking to the rim. Our ranger was amazing, especially with our kids (ages 14, 13, 9, 7) questions. We also walked/hiked the rim trail.

The geological rock formations (hoodoos) are otherworldly and absolutely beautiful when brushed with snow.

We still loved every bit of it! The views are outstanding and the walking paths are up close to a lot of rock formations. The flat paths around these view points are easy for small children to enjoy. The lodge is a little lackluster compared to other national parks, but they had a really nice gift shop selling local goods. April is still very chilly, more so than other southern Utah parks.

We turned right and explored many places, doing plenty of hikes. We decided to cut our stay short in Sedona to swing by the Grand Canyon South Rim and drive to Bryce. Wow is all I have to say! Bryce Canyon is so unique and different with its spires etc. It blew me away! Even the drive through Red Canyon was just gorgeous! I’d love to bike there! We stopped at all the lookouts and were surprised there were so few people on a Saturday morning! We had no problem parking our rv and it was great! We had to wear jackets cause it was cool and windy but so worth it! There were hiking trails that we’ll definitely hike when we go back there! It was way more beautiful and breathtaking than Grand Canyon in my opinion. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and this is definitely a beauty to see!

In the spring time when the park is covered in snow slush and mud... a days visit to the vistas is great. Hiking is limited and be ready to slide a bit on snow and ice. The hoodoos in the snow are beautiful. ONE DAY is ENOUGH time spent here when snow is on the ground and ALL the trails are closed. Visit in the summer and fall if you plan to hike among the hoodoos. Best Western is a great place to stay. Breakfast is appreciated. Dinner options are really limited. The food here will not impress you.

You can walk to many (but not all) of the viewpoints. You can also drive to a number of viewpoints. Do drive to Bryce point. There are a couple of viewpoints along the way. The trails are closed up there too but you can get to a viewpoint. It is still pretty quiet at the park. I went early Monday morning (7:40) and saw 6 people. Yes, I was too late for sunrise.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"As any review will tell you, the views of Bryce Canyon are stunning and beyond compare. If you don't have this as a place to visit on your bucket list, add it. We learned some things worth noting on your trip. If you are coming in the summer, you can stop here.1. Bryce can get lots of snow. The views with snow are stunning and worth the trip, but the trails below the rim are closed in winter and often well into Spring. We visited at the end of March and the trails were still going to be closed for at least another week or two.2. If you visit in the winter or spring, be prepared for both cold and wind. The wind on the bluffs can quickly chill you to the bone. Make sure to wear layers.3. The hikes you can do are still worth it in the Winter and Spring. The rim hike was a great experience, as every stop along the way gave another and different beautiful view of the hoodoos.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Yes, upon that first view from the shuttle (always always use the shuttles vs your car!) of the amphitheater you will be astounded. Stayed for a full 24 hrs and were able to pack in 6 hikes thanks to the connectivity between trails (and shuttle). Visit was at the end of June which aided our hiking in that we hiked all the way until 9 pm without a torch. Campsites were so close to trails and quiet during sleep hours. Visitor Center provides a respite in the late afternoon from the sun, as well as do the little shops. Bring and drink plenty of water and use a refillable bottle as it is easy with so many fill stations at convenient locations around the park. Whether you have 24 hrs or a few days, whether you do one hike or twelve, you will be thankful you saw this wonder.Tip: Begin your day at 6am and enjoy the cooler temps and smaller crowds. It's worth it to see the colors on the rocks during sunrise and to be getting back for lunch in the shade while the crowds are just staring their day!Take advantage of the light and do ""night"" hikes! While 7:30pm seems late to start a hike, it is light enough and you can see a different set of colors on the hoodoos.

This made a day with lots of trail closures sooooo amazing and so worth it. This place is absolutely beautiful and we are looking forward to coming back in warmer months and hiking Navajo trail and some of the others that were closed down in the canyon.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Came here in December with four teenagers. In the end, we all felt this was more visually interesting than the Grand Canyon. There was some limitation on trails we could walk - it was way more cold, windy and snow covered here than it had been down in Zion earlier that week. But it is so unique and worth the drive up. We had been advised to drive to the end of the road in the park and work our way back - good advice. Many of the stops offer similar views and you can choose to start skipping them, but if you start at the front, you might quit before you get to the end and that view was great at the highest point. There weren't really many food places around and what was there wasn't open in December, but that's not why we came. Beautiful drive even if you can't do alot of walking. Just get out at the various pull offs and enjoy the view.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We only spent half a day at Bryce, mostly at the key overlook area around the main amphitheatre although we went as far as Farview Point, which was not as interesting. The main overlooks of Sunset, Inspiration and Bryce Point can be walked and covered at one go, each offering different views of the spectacular formations, with Bryce probably the best for the widest panoramic photos with the distant mountains as the background. We also walked down to the canyon floor from Sunset Point which is not very difficult and offers the best close ups of the colourful formations.","February 17, 2019",Fantastic formations and colors,197,"Singapore, Singapore",5

Multiple places where you can stand at the edge and look down at the sheer majesty of the hoodoos.. without any rock walls or fencing keeping you back. If you have kids, you need to watch them VERY carefully. The temps were amazingly very moderate compared to the rest of the desert areas we went to visit other national parks, but you still should bring a hat and lots of water and sunscreen.

It's a completely different experience to be up close and exploring firsthand while trying to grasp the science that created these wonders. We hiked Navajo trail into the canyon which was by far my favorite. I want to go back and explore the Below the Rim Trail, this is a bit longer but looks incredible! This park is easily accessible and many of the viewpoints are paved and handicap accessible. Water is available at the visitor center. We spent about 6 hours total un the park and this was sufficient, less if you dont plan to hike.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is one of the gems of the National Park system. While not as grand or expansive as the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon shines with more intimate views highlighted by unique hoodoos. The distinct color of the rocks provides a beautiful contrast to the vegetation and blue skies. The park is very popular and parking lots at popular viewpoints can fill up. There is a shuttle bus you can use instead to avoid that hassle during peak times. The large visitor center is well-staffed and has a large gift shop. However, for dining, you will need to go to the lodge or drive back outside the park. Most of the best views are in the Bryce Amphitheatre area. However, don’t forget to drive south to see the rest of the park. The hikes into the canyon are also beautiful. Though make sure to bring ample water and sun protection if hiking in the summer. Also keep in mind you are at a high altitude and the uphill climb back from the hikes can be strenuous.","December 22, 2018",Spectacular,97,"New York City, New York",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"The park was exceptional. But you know that, given your efforts to get to this remote and gorgeous piece of the world. Who can say anything that will match the magnificent and abundant beauty of Bryce? You would have to be a poet. I am reviewing the park just to provide a suggested travel plan.....we are fit and enjoy hiking, but we are not interested in hours of hiking. So for us, we took the following actions. We went to the visitor center inside the park, and got info and checked current conditions. Then we drove to Inspiration although most visitors will be there when the shuttles are running. Having gotten to Inspiration Point then we walked to Sunrise Point and Sunset Point. We took it easy and enjoyed the beautiful overlooks. Very pleasant walking a paved path with stunning hoodoo formations to gawk at--spend a couple of hours and take lots of pictures. Your friends will be wowed by the fantastic pictures. The next day we went on a driving tour of Scenic Byway 12. Bryce is actually part of the Highway 12 experience. I reviewed this elsewhere in Tripadvisor. It was a unique and thrilling road trip for a day and broke up the hiking a bit. On the third day in the morning we returned to Sunrise Point and hiked down into the Navajo Trail, the Queens Garden, and Wall Street which are all connected. Again the paths were well maintained and broad, so the big drop-offs weren't so scary. Parents would have to be mindful of their kids. Hiking poles are helpful. Wear heavy duty shoes....no sandals or sneakers!!! We had sandwiches and enjoyed a rest at the bottom of the canyon. Having a big hike in the morning we enjoyed driving out to the end of the park without stopping to Rainbow Point and Yovimpa Point. Dont miss Yovimpa its easy to overlook. Then having enjoyed these vantage points go back on your same road but stop at the turn outs. Lots to see. Go in October-May and you will have much less company than the the high summer season. Our November experience was fantastic with very few tourists about. The temperature also should be moderate and not the 100 degrees of July for example.

The park staff were very friendly and helpful, the hikes were well marked, the park was very clean, and the views were awesome. Totally worth it. The peek a boo loop trail combined with the Navajo loop trail are really worth hiking. takes about 3.5 hours all in ( includes lots of stops for photos) It was difficult only because of lots of ups and downs. The second day we did the Queen's/Navajo loop trails. Took about 2 1/2 hours, again with lots of photo stops. Again, it was worthwhile.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"On a long trip to visit our National Parks before they are gone, Bryce Canyon was on our list. It is a very well maintained park. (Please note that in all of our park visits in Utah, Arizona and NM, the park rangers were extremely focused on park protection and guest service. They were ALL passionate about their duty and focus and a joy to interact with). Do your research on what the park offers regarding vistas to enjoy and hikes to take. Bryce Canyon must be put on your list. We did not stay as long as we had wanted due to time constraints but hope we can get back to see more. One word of caution; this park as with all the other parks we visited, there is little to no cell service so be prepared. We would suggest strongly carrying a satellite GPS device especially if you are going on hikes. There is NO wifi anywhere at these places other than your hotel (if offered). Even in more populated areas, cell service can be spotty and at a low technical band width.","November 15, 2018",A great American Treasure!,67,"Westchester County, New York",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We have been to Bryce before but didn't spend as long there then as we did this time. It was just as fabulous as we recall it (perhaps, even more so) and the sheer beauty, scale and grandeur simply take one's breath away. However, it's not all about the 'classical' viewpoints - no; to get the very best out of Bryce one has to descend into that maze like wonderland of Hoodoos and winding tracks to really make the most of the location. We took on a number of trails during our stay - the Queens Garden Trail and Navajo Trails are 'must do's', but we also did the Peekaboo Loop trail as well and that was well worth the effort (note: do it in the directions suggested - clockwise; it's a little less energy sapping that way!). Take plenty of water - it is a dry and arid place down there - but the efforts are well worth it with some stunning views and locations and a few little hidden delights that take you by surprise - especially round Peekaboo. Sunrise and Sunset Points are, of course, well populated at their respective times but worth the effort irrespective of time of year, whilst a drive deep into the park also affords some alternative viewpoints and changes to the scenery and geology on show - Rainbow and Yovimpa Points are both well worth the drive up into the park to see something a little different and experience the Park to it's fullest.

Like all hiking in Utah, bring sensible footwear, water and a hat. The scenery is stunning so you will be stopping a lot (good for brief rests) to take pictures.

Beautiful day, so drove the 18 miles to the farthest point and worked our way back.

All of us were in agreement that Bryce Canyon was our favorite. We arrived late in the afternoon and enjoyed driving the entire Park Road around sunset and stopping at various overlooks. The next morning, we arrived at inspiration point about 30 min prior to sunrise (spectacular!!) and hiked Navajo and Peek-a-Boo Loops. I definitely recommend adding Peek-a-Boo loop; there was a different view around every turn and it was never dull. Navajo loop gets busy so I recommend starting early.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is simply one of the most beautiful geological wonders you will ever see. The shades of burnt orange and the steep canyon walls will take your breath away. There are several hikes within the canyon, along with multiple observation points of varying heights you can drive to within the park. We did a father aggressive hike starting at Sunset Point, then descending the canyon to do portions of the Queens Garden, Navajo, and Peekaboo Loops. Plan your hikes ahead of time as some of these trails are the same trails they do horseback, and you will need to navigate loads of horse manure and urine which could turn you off. Be sure to end your hike in the canyon visiting “Wall Street” and navigating the steep switchbacks up through this part of the canyon.If you have time and are not camping in the park, come back at night to Sunset Point to star-gaze.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Even with stellar reviews Bryce is over looked and underrated. You would be surprised how often people exclude Bryce while planning trips. We did a loop that started out in Las Vegas to Zion to Bryce to Lake Powell (which included Horse shoe bend, Upper and Lower Antelope Canyon and a cruise on the lake through Antelope canyon again) to Grand Canyon and then to Sedona and back to Las Vegas. Out of all the awesome beauty and fun adventures on this trip, we were in awe with how beautiful Bryce is. As with most national parks, it's easy to drive and park at Bryce's many lots... only a short walk from majestic sights. You can be happy doing just this but there is sooooo much more. The loop trails are absolutely unreal. You have safe wide switch backs into the canyon with soaring stone walls and through tunnels cut into stone. At the bottom you have miles of trails weaving through beautiful pines. If you're an advanced hiker and prefer solitude, go further as most people hike only a portion from either side of loop trails or better yet, pick trails that aren't loops. I hate to pick a favorite place of all we visited but this is definitely highest on the list for beauty, rejuvenating the soul and overall satisfaction....we hiked a lot in 24 hours trying to absorb as much as we could and wished we allowed another day!","October 26, 2018",Absolutely a magical place!,54,"Patterson, New York",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"A major feature of Bryce Canyon National Park is the fact that it isn't a canyon but a collection of giant natural amphitheaters along the eastern side of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. Bryce is distinctive due to geological structures called hoodoos, formed by frost weathering and stream erosion of the river and lake bed sedimentary rocks. The red, orange and white colors of the rocks provide spectacular views for park visitors. The area was settled by Mormon pioneers and was named for Ebenezer Bryce, who homesteaded in the area in 1874. It was designated a National Monument in 1923 and a National Park in 1928. Remote, it attracts fewer visitors than Zion National Park and Grand Canyon National Park each year. But there are aspects about Bryce that are unique to one and all. For example, a series of amphitheaters extends more than 20 miles north to south within the park. The largest is Bryce Amphitheater, which is 12 miles long, three miles wide and 800 feet deep. Rainbow Point, the highest part of the park at 9,105 feet, is at the end of the 18-mile scenic drive. From there, Aquarium Plateau, Bryce Amphitheater, the Henry Mountains, the Vermillion Cliffs and the White Cliffs can been seen. Archaeological surveys show people have been in the area for at least 10,000 years. But it was not until the late 18th and early 19th century that the first European Americans explored the remote and hard-to-reach area. Mormons visited the area in the 1850s. The first major scientific expedition was led by John Wesley Powell in 1872. The park has 13 scenic viewpoints over the amphitheaters, eight marked and maintained hiking trails that can be hiked in less than a day, two overnight hiking trails, more than 10 miles of marked but ungroomed skiing trails, two campgrounds and the 114-room Bryce Canyon Lodge. The air is so clean that on most days from Yovimpa and Rainbow points, Navajo Mountain and the Kaibab Plateau can be seen 90 miles away in Arizona. On extremely clear days, the Black Mesa of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico can been seen 160 miles away.","October 21, 2018",Bryce Canyon isn't really a canyon,4679,"Chicago, Illinois",5

We were not disappointed with anyone of them. In the afternoon once it warmed up quite a bit we went back to Brycepoint and walked and the upper rim Trail. Some parts were a little muddy but it seems like a safe walk. Late in the afternoon, we hiked the mossy cave trail to the waterfall. That was gorgeous! I even liked it better than the waterfall in Zion. We were so thankful that we were there on the day we have been there because people have been there a couple days earlier and there was a snowstorm and they couldn’t see anything. I would watch the weather averages to decide when would be a good time to visit. I am from Chicago 30° there felt warmer then 50° here.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"CAMPING: We stayed in the park Oct 9-10 at the North Campground with our truck and camper. Sunset Campground was muddier, with more puddles, more potholes. The dump stations were closed, as was the dump in front of Ruby’s in town. There are no hookups in the park. No reservations are taken, first come/first served. We arrived around 11 and had several spots to choose from. By evening all the spots were full. There are restrooms, dishwashing sinks, water pumps, and a shower at the entrance which we didn’t use. PARKING: We took the camper off the truck and drove to Sunrise/Sunset which is within the campground. Parking was available (it was a Tuesday) but we never did make it to the visitor center. The parking lot was full every time we drove by. The next morning we drove to the far end of the park to Rainbow Point. At 8 am we were the only ones there. The roads were snowy so I’m sure this kept people away. By 10 am the lots were filling up on the trip back towards the entrance. FOOD: The food in the park was either grocery store choices or the restaurant in the lodge which was pricy. We thought we’d have lots of dinner choices in town but a lot of the restaurants had 2-3 stars, not a good sign, or they were pretty expensive, or had very long waits. We settled on the Cowboy Ranch House. Not fancy but decent. There was also a Subway, the only fast food place in Bryce.WHAT WE DID AND SAW: We hiked the Navajo Loop and visited every major viewpoint. Upper Inspiration Point was the best view by far. Early mornings and late afternoon will give you the best photo opportunities when you get some shadow off the hoodoos. The weather can change fast!

Our guide was Nabor and he was very good.It is easy to drive around the park too.About 40 minute drive plus stops at the lookouts.Sunrise, sunset and Inspiration Point were our favorites.You can also take the shuttle bus through the park to the main lookouts.Plus you can do about a one hour loop walk.

Than we went with this bus till the last point (Bryce point) and than have gone on foot back. We have visited Inspiration point, Sunrise & sunset points and have made a Navajo loop trail (about 40-50 Minutes). The nex day we went to see the sunrise there and it was a thrilling view (was just about 40 Grad - so very very cold) and a lot of people, so you need to come earlier when you want to park there.I would like to see this park in winter.You can use Annual Pass here (80 dollars for a year).","October 8, 2018",An amazing View,6,Switzerland,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"The actual experience of seeing the Bryce Canyon amphitheatre beats any photos or guide book descriptions. We made a day trip from La Verkin and were enchanted, even though the more distant parts of the park were temporarily closed by rangers because of a managed forest fire following a lightning strike a few days earlier.We gradually worked into the highlights of Sunset and Sunrise Points from more distant overlooks, which were all in themselves beautiful, until we reached the central vantage points, which were simply stunning in the colours and varieties of shapes seen. As Bryce himself said when first viewing the myriad of eroded pinnacles: 'It's a helluva place to lose a cow'!One could easily spend hours just marvelling at the works of nature revealed here. Those fit enough to hike down to the floor of the amphitheatre would get a different perspective, but even just viewing from above is awe-inspiring. The nature of the rock formations together with the colours revealed by the erosion over millions of years is breath-taking. One of the highlights of our trip.","October 8, 2018",Stunning!,59,St. Andrews,5

Bryce Canyon National Park," Bryce Canyon Utah is one of America’s most picturesque national parks. The color and the beauty of the landscape is beyond compare. Years of weathering in the canyon has produced hoodoos. This is what they call the carvings in the canyon that can look like actual people and animals. You can look at one and see several different things at one time The nice thing is once you enter the park you can drive around and see different views of the canyon. During the month of July, temperatures are very hot and you can always expect a pop-up thunderstorm in the afternoon, so plan on your trip starting in the morning and ending mid afternoon. I highly recommend a visit to Bryce Canyon Utah for your bucket list.","October 7, 2018",Bryce Canyon Utah,2,"Wentzville, Missouri",5

But Bryce is a close second and why I gave it a four-star (but it can easily be a Five Star). It has some unique motherly nature structures (Moab has arches).

Bryce Canyon National Park,Got to the park early so we could make the most of the day.. when you drive into the park drive all the way to the very end until you can go no further... the reason for this is all of the pullovers where you can park your car and look at the views are all on the right side... believe me this is good advice.Views are absolutely spectacular. We took a picnic with us. There is an area to buy food there but it's expensive.My favorite area was the Natural Bridge. We also loved Inspiration Point. There is a big hill there to walk up and if you're somewhat fit try and do it. I walked up halfway to the first observation point and didn't go to the second because I didn't feel I would be fit enough at that elevation.

From Bryce Point we took the Rim Trail to Inspiration Point and back. Finally we hit the main parking area and took the easy trips to Sunset and Sunrise Points. We took lots of photos and enjoyed ourselves.

Also we found the shuttle drivers to be engaging, informative and great ambassadors of the park. Loved this visit!","October 2, 2018",Wowza!,9,Maryland,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We just spent 2 weeks visiting the Mighty Five National Parks in Utah. Each park is amazing on its own merit. Arches was our favorite based on shear beauty. Bryce Canyon however, was our favorite based on uniqueness and hiking. The hoodoos are like nothing I have ever seen. My wife suggested Bryce Canyon is like walking in an aquarium without the water. The formations reassemble delicate coral on a reef more than rock outcroppings. The trail difficulty ratings at Bryce seem a little underrated to us. We are fairly healthy 60+ year olds, but the moderate trails included significant elevation changes unlike the other parks. We experienced continuous climbs over 500 feet. Definitely doable, but check with the ranger if unsure. Gotta see it!!","October 2, 2018",Fantasyland!,84,"Russellville, Arkansas",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon has some of the most unusual geological formations of any of the National P:arks that we have visited. The red rock formations with vertical spires are simply awesome. The park road is about 18 miles long and is not a through road, so you have to drive to the end (if you wish) and then turn around and return on the same road. That does give you the opportunity to stop at some of the overlooks you may have missed. The park road raises to an elevation of about 9115 ft and can get quite cool as the sun sets, even on a warm day at the park entrance. You can easily spend 3 to 4 hours in the park just to view most of the scenic overlooks. However, if you are limited in time, I recommend must stops at Sunset Point Overlook and Natural Bridge Overlook (a different rock formation from the rest of the park). Wear layers of clothing because the weather can change quite rapidly. We visited on a warm, sunny day in Early September and could see rain clouds in the very far distance. However, within one hour, the clouds rolled in with thunder and lightning, and disappeared again within an hour. i believe this is one of the most beautiful and unusual national parks and highly recommend a visit when in southwestern Utah.","October 2, 2018",Amazing Scenery - Best National Park,107,"Pottstown, Pennsylvania",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Without a doubt Bryce is one of those unique places that you have to see in person to truly appreciate. The HooDoos are awe inspiring and otherworldly. That being said, we did a very long hike ( around 15 miles) around and up and down the canyon and a couple of words of advice:First - it can be exerting. Just remember - what goes down must come up. This can be helped with a planned out use of the shuttle buses. We, unfortunately, got there very early (before sunrise) and parked ar Fairyland Point parking lot - the shuttle DOES NOT go there - so if you do park there know you need to be able to hike back to it.Water is scarce - There was water and a store at Sunset point, but otherwise I did not find any ( there may be some - but we did not find any) - it was not especially hot and we still went through all of our camelback bladders - so be prepared with extra supplies if you plan on doing the long hikesFinally - with all the beauty - it is not a varied hike - more or less the same sort of views throughout.

Sunset Point is a great place to have lunch, fill up your water bottles and use the bathroom. Ok now you will descend down to Navajo Trail towards the Two Bridges.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We came here in 1983 with our kids. Took some pictures. My wife and I revisited this year, 2018. It all looks the same, (Geological changes are slow.) But, it is just as beautiful as it was the first time.Utah is known for its parks and monuments, and although each one is a geologic marvel, each one is also unique itself. Bryce is spectacular for its orange hoodoos. And they are easy to see. There are pull outs and parking lots to view them from, all along the main drive. We opted to just drive to each one and look, and then leave, since my wife cannot hike. If you hike, remember that if you go down, you have to come back up, and it is a whole lot easier going down. It can be misleading as you descend. (Been there, done that.) Remember to bring lots of water if you do any hiking. I noticed that they also have a pleasant looking paved bike path.At the entrance to the park is a small village where just about anything you might need is available. Crowds at the time we went, early September, weren't overwhelming. Only at the furthest viewing spot, Rainbow Point, did parking become congested. Otherwise, it was easy to find parking at each viewing location, and traffic on the road was not a problem.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Our visit was expected to be just a few hours so we first stopped at visitor center to determine what hike would accommodate our time schedule. \Outside the center are signs encouraging visitors to park across the street and take the shuttle to your destination v driving your car. After a bit of ""debate"" with my husband, he caved and took the shuttle but not without some grumbling. Good thing his wife was right again... me. He thought we could just drive to the trail head, park, and be on our way. Wrong. While riding the shuttle and stopping at each checkpoint, that's when we discovered there are very few parking spots; hence good luck on trying to find a spot without having to constantly circle back, etc. So we got off at our trailhead, hiked to another trailhead and caught the shuttle to go back to the visitor's center. This was especially nice insofar as 1) We listened to our driver, George, who gave some interesting factoids we would not have otherwise heard (he also was VERY entertaining); and 2) we got caught in a rain storm and were drenched. So boarding the bus and having someone drive us back was a relief. If you get a good driver, a shuttle ride can be a great experience. Even if the driver is not as entertaining as George, you at least can reach your destination without having to try and find a parking spot. Again, kudos to the National Park Service for creating a user-friendly destination.","September 25, 2018",TAKE the park shuttle bus. Go to the bathroom before your hike!

The park can get very crowded, so we listened to the advice of a Ranger and arrived before nine to get to two popular trails - Sunset and Navajo.

We were then able to see the rest of the park at s relaxed pace.","September 24, 2018",Unique Park,180,"Rye, NY",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We did not get to see the entire park, due to wildfires, but we did get to see the hoodoos, which was worth the trip. The hike to see them is short, and you can look down into the amphitheater full of them. As the sun changes position, so do the colors of these spires. We also stopped at the Fairyland Point and walked to look at the hoodoos. This gives visitors another great view of them. There is also a stop, which does not require hiking, to view the Natural Bridge. There are certainly other hikes, which are outlined in the material provided at the entrance, and the people at the visitor center are always helpful in planning a day in the park. This park can get pretty crowded, so parking in some areas can be challenging, but it is certainly worth a visit.","September 24, 2018",Love the Hoodoos,154,Pennsylvania,5

The drivers are very knowledgeable and can fill you in on a lot of things. There are two different shuttles and each take you to a different area. The Rainbow shuttle you need to make reservations, because they only go 9:00 am and 1:30 pm. This shuttle lasts 3 1/2 hours.The other shuttles go every 10 minutes and you can jump on and off at different sites.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is a very popular and crowded National Park especially in September and October so parking is a real problem when driving around the park from one observation point to another, but we couldn't take the park shuttle because we were traveling with our dogs that are not allowed on the shuttles. The views of the canyon from the observation areas are spectacular. There are many hiking trails, but again they don't allow dogs on them and it simply is too hot to leave then in the car. You need to lock up your car when stopping....we observed a lady who didn't do this and when she returned to her car it had been stolen.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"What a great time we had visiting and hiking Bryce Canyon. As good and more manageable that some of the ""Grand-er"" canyons. More manageable in that free shuttle buses can take you anywhere, and fewer visitors make the experience more pleasant. If you hike off the beaten path you can enjoy real serenity. Serenity Now!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Serene vistas are deceptive and landscape is never static. The hoodoos make this place truly fascinating. Weathering and erosion shape these rocks. As snow melts, water seeps into fractures. As it refreezes, it expands and cracks around it. The entire Bryce Canyon has been formed by this frost wedging process.

The trail runs above Bryce Canyon and connects all the scenic overlooks from Fairyland Point to Bryce Point. … Please note that it gets very steep at the end (probably the last half mile), which you do not need to do.

There are plenty of scenic places to sit with your family and loved ones - and just unclutter your mind with the surrounding beauty!

We only did the rim trail and that was perfect!- wear hiking shoes and take water. The rim has areas of ups and downs but is mostly level. - you can not park extended time at the visitor center.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"My husband and I recently visited Bryce Canyon National Park. While doing research I stumbled upon the park offering of the Rainbow Point Tour.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I know most people prefer Zion over Bryce but I liked Bryce better for hiking and scenery. However, there is no real town to speak of and not much in terms of accommodations. Zion has a cute town but Bryce doesn't - there is some touristy stuff by Ruby's but that is it really. If you don't hike there is not much here other than biking. You need to enter the Canyon to appreciate the beauty from top to bottom.","August 26, 2018",Loved the hiking and scenery at Bryce,88,new york,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited Bryce Canyon in August and absolutely loved the place, the landscape is absolutely stunning, very different from anything else we had seen before. We parked at the visitor centre and took the free shuttle as we had heard that parking at the different stops in the park can be difficult in the summer with many visitors. This worked really well as we went to Bryce Point on the shuttle, and then walked up to inspiration point and then to Sunset Point, with beautiful views of the canyon. We then went down on the Navajo loop and then onto the Queens garden trail up to the Sunrise point, the scenery is unbelievable!We were staying in Springdale and did the trip to Bryce Canyon in one day, about 4 hours drive in total, with an early start in the morning, with some beautiful views on the way. Our tip would be to get there relatively early, use the shuttle, do some of the hikes to get a good view from the canyon, bring a picnic, take a lot of water, and do not forget hat, suncream and your camera!","August 26, 2018",One of the best national parks!,22,"London, United Kingdom",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Beautiful place, amazing. We really only spent about 24 hours here, got in later in the day the first day and left after lunch the second day. All in all, that was enough time to see the highlights. Went to the star-gazing with the telescopes the rangers set up at the visitor's center on certain evenings. That was pretty cool, but lots of people and the wait was pretty long to get through the lines to see the star formations. The second day we walked the rim trail from Bryce Point to Sunset Point, great hike to see the best parts of the Canyon. At Sunset Point, we hiked into the canyon on the Navajo Loop trail. That was very cool, but the hike back up is no joke, make sure to bring plenty of water. There is another shuttle that will take you all the way to the end of the park, but we felt like we saw the highlights in the time we had. Highly recommend if you are in the area.","August 24, 2018",Amazing!,107,"Atlanta, Georgia",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,Got opportunity to hike Bryce Canyon. We started at sunrise point and went down queens garden loop and back out Navajo trail. If I had to do it again I would go backwards of that. Pretty good haul coming out at Navajo. Took us about 2 hours. It was raining off and on and storming. Drove up to natural bridge. That is a must. Drove on up and rain into sleet and ice on the road in August. Mid 40’s. Weather is something you need to check on before planning. Worth the trip!!,"August 23, 2018",Hike ,6,"Willis, Virginia",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce is a wonderful national park... not very large and very accessible. The views are breathtaking and the hikes are a lot of fun. However I am writing this review to point out the National Park Service shuttle buses and what a great choice it was to utilize this free service. I am not talking about the shuttles that come every 10 minutes, I mean the 3 hour guided tour bus that leaves from Ruby's at 9am and 1:30 pm. This is the best way to see and learn about Bryce before you go in and wander around on your own. We had a wonderful local driver named April who was fabulous. She told us many great tips to use to enjoy our stay. You need to reserve the tour! It's free, visit the Bryce/NPS website for info to reserve your seats no more than 7 days prior to arriving.Kudos to Bryce and the NPS for providing this great service.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Natural beauty exceeded our expectations, and despite the crowds, was gorgeous and amazing. Hiking into the canyon fun and memorable. However, we were shocked by the poor management: e.g. illegible interpretive signage that should have been replaced LONG AGO. Literally could not read many signs. Rotting wooden barriers and benches that should be replaced. How can one of the most frequently visited parks in the system be allowed to fall into such bad condition!? Where’s all the entry fee money going? We came from the Grand Teton National Park and saw an enormous difference in quality of management.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is gloriously beautiful! The views are just breathtaking. Seriously, I feel like time spent there restores my soul. There are a wide variety of trails for hiking, some relatively easy and others more strenuous. Always be sure to check the weather, afternoon thunderstorms are common in the summer and lightning strikes are prevalent (just check out the blackened trees along the Rim Trail.) If your time is limited, hike portions of the Rim Trail, including Inspiration Point. There is a free shuttle system you can access along the trail if you tire of walking. The Rim Trail is fairly easy, though portions of it are hilly and do NOT have railing, so be careful of venturing too close to the canyon edge. Hikes into the canyon are wonderful, but make sure there's no rain in the forecast. I once had to navigate one of the trails in a downpour and it NOT something I care to repeat. There are several spots along the Rim Trail where rangers offer talks about the canyon. These are well worth your time.","August 22, 2018",Breathtakingly beautiful!,53,"Carlisle, Pennsylvania",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I'm lucky enough to live only about 200 miles north of Bryce Canyon. So that shouldn't be an excuse when I admit that it's been ten years since the last time I visited! I was only there for a quick overnight visit this time...because it was peak season for the Perseid meteor shower. We arrived mid afternoon, went to the bypassed the visitors center and went to the rim. We did a short hike from Sunset to Sunrise lookout points (I believe that's what they're called). I definitely suggest going sunset to sunrise instead of vise versa. Either way, you'll have about 350 ft of elevation change down and then back up again in a roughly 2.5 mile loop! No matter the season, bring more water than you think you'll need, possibly a light snack, hiking poles if you have them...oh, and your camera! Take your time, but pay attention to the clock. I'd say we went at the perfect time to beat most of the heat (roughly 5:30 pm in mid-August).There are other places in the park to visit if you want...more strenuous hikes, and light hikes around the rim. You can get up early or stay up later for sunrise/sunset photo opportunities. The rangers are all knowledgeable and friendly.Definitely worth a multiple day stay if you can swing it.

The park was clean in all the areas we visited. There was ample parking assisted in part by the shuttle that operated from outside the park and then throughout the visitor areas.

As soon as you leave the car and reach the Canyon, e.g. at Sunset point, you've a mind blowing experience. The colors and shapes of the rocks are unbeliavable. No picture gives justice and you can stop looking around noticing detail after detail. Even the shortest trail worth taking some heat and it's a fun park of the kids as well.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is another National Park that makes me both proud to be an American, while also wishing like heck that I had more time. But let's say that you can't spend more than a couple of hours at Bryce, since you have to drive like a crazy person to the airport to return your rental car. What then?1. Start early so there's a reasonable chance you can park inside the park. You don't have to drive from place to place inside the park, but it really speeds things up to avoid taking the shuttle in from the ""Ruby's Area"". We probably wasted 20 minutes going in a circle after parking in the main outside parking lot.2. Drive into the park at least as far as Sunset Point/Parking area. See if you can park there; if so, you can see a heck of a lot of the park and it's only taken you a few minutes to get there.3. If you're up for it (and remember, the elevation is 8,000 feet and it's frequently blistering hot), take the Navajo Trail down into the canyon. You don't have to go too far, although you should if you have the time and lots of water, since you get dramatically different perspectives by just descending a few hundred feet. 4. Consider walking along the rim to the next parking area, then take the shuttle back to wherever you started. The rim is relatively flat, and the changing perspectives are, well, changing.5. Not all places on the shuttle route connect easily, so take a few minutes to understand this. You may end up going further than you have time for, and I found it a little confusing until I spent a few minutes with the diagram.If you arrive at 8:30, you can have a brief but incredible encounter with the park and still leave by 10:30 or 11:00. I know that's how Americans tend to ""do"" Europe and other exotic places (Rome in Three Hours!), but it's still worth it. Best $35 you'll ever spend (or $20 if you're over 62).","August 11, 2018","There's very little I can add, but I have a few suggestions...",241,"Santa Cruz, California",5

Spectacular views. Drones are prohibited, and there is not much else to do if your goal is not focused on enjoying nature from a very comfortable situation. There are hiking tracks that require a lot of fitness condition, so study first where you want to go. There ar some mild condition tracks for walking. You also have incredible views from parking lots along the canyon. So all kinds of people can enjoy this.","August 6, 2018",One of the most beautiful canyons in the world,7,,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We have travelled here twice in winter but this was our first time seeing it in summer. Lots of heat so take lots of water on your walk. We decided to do the Queens Garden Trail to the Navajo Trail. It is also recommended on the National Park map to do it in a clockwise direction. Either way you are going to get in some fantastic views and plenty of time to do it and places to stop and rest. Doing it this way the climb out felt shorter with the steep switchbacks right at the end. It wasn't scary and I certainly didn't feel unsafe. It's an amazing park to see from start to end but we were limited to the main amphitheatre for this visit. It is also a dark sky area and we stayed back to enjoy the absolutely amazing view of the Milky Way rising above from the rim of the trails. If you are lucky enough to be their on the right night, rangers hold astronomy nights. You see so much more out here.","August 4, 2018",One of our favourite national parks in the USA,16,"Brisbane, Australia",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Another amazing place to visit in Utah. I will say this, if you can only visit one I'd pick Zion . Having said that, what else can I say about this place others aren't all saying? The views are awesome. The fee to enter is $35 (I bought the annual pass for $80 and it's paid off with all my visits.) There is a shuttle service that will take you to the different overlooks if you don't feel like driving your car. I hiked down into the amphitheater starting at the Queens Garden and then climbed back up the Navajo Trail. Most people say to go the opposite way and it's mainly because of the switchbacks that, in my case ended, this hike. They can be a little rough. But I'll say this I have a fear of heights and it kicked in a little when I first attempted to start with Navajo. So I decided to try starting with Queens Garden instead cause it seemed like a less steep entry point. That's what I did it, and it was. If you also have fear of heights start with Queens but definitely push yourself to continue. Trust me, you'll be glad you did.","August 4, 2018",Excellent Hike Into Amphitheater,294,New Jersey,4

Last time we saw it. it was covered in snow, so it was really good to see it without the white covering for our second visit. All the viewpoints offer a different vista, and the colours are just spectacular. My only negative is the noise that some people - usually from coach trips - make while visiting - it felt like a theme park rather than a beautiful natural spot on occasions. I would have enjoyed it even more without the high-pitched shouting in my ears.","August 2, 2018",How could you not love this place?,118,"Lincoln, United Kingdom",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is my second visit to Bryce Canyon. It is by far my most favorite ahead of Zion and Grand Canyon. The unique rock formations are so picturesque. We arrived at 11:25am at the Visitor’s Center entrance on a July Friday after a 2.5 hr drive from St. George. Entry cost is $35 per vehicle but we used a National park pass. Inside parking was still available at the Center and across the street. We were at the park for 3.5 hours. Shuttle pickup at the Center was standing room only. (Many visitors took advantage of the huge parking lot outside the park. Don’t know how park fees are handled.) Shuttles came at 10 minute intervals. We got off at Shuttle Stop #6, Sunset Point for the most popular hike, Navajo Loop. Even though the hike is considered easy, it is not for someone with fear of heights. The trail is about 8 feet wide. One should walk slowly back up due to the high altitude. Many people were grasping for air including one in our group. (We did not circle the loop this time.) Although Bryce is about 15 degrees cooler than St. George, the temperature was still in the mid 80s. If you can briefly hike though, the stunning view looking up is worth your effort.After 1.5 hours at Sunset Point, we took the shuttle out of the park and back in before reaching Bryce Point, Shuttle Stop #3 in 50 minutes. (Faster if we had exited shuttle and walked across to catch opposite shuttle at the Visitor’s Center prior to shuttle leaving park.) At Bryce Point, we had spectacular views from lookout point.","July 30, 2018",Most Unique National Park,151,"Anaheim, California",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"When traveling in Canada and the USA, I tend to seek out national, state & provincial parks. This summer while travelling through Utah we visited 4 of the 5 National parks in that state, spending several days at each park (except, Zion). Bryce Canyon was my favourite park. The amphitheatres filled with hoodoos were absolutely spectacular! This is heaven for anyone interested in photography. While most of my time was spent on the rim at the various lookouts, one morning, just after sunrise, we hiked to the base of Bryce amphitheatre (Navajo loop trail) for a different perspective of the hoodoos – highly recommended. If you only have time to visit one Ntl park in Utah, my recommendation is Bryce Canyon.","July 29, 2018",WOW,779,"Halifax, Canada",5

Shuttle buses are also available if you prefer. We are here for 2 days. Today we saw a lot. Breathtaking shapes formed over 1000's of years. Cant imagine what we'll see on an early start tomorrow. What you will see beggars belief. The wonder of nature.We went to the visitor centre and watched a short overview film about life in the Canyon.

When I asked why not, almost all of them said it was too far away and difficult to get to. The trip from Zion to Bryce was a beautiful drive and we did it in under 2 hrs. I want to encourage people who are considering which parks to visit to include Bryce. It is well worth the extra effort and time. It was easy and comfortable to travel from lookout to lookout in the park in our own car. We could go at a pace that suited us and we never had a problem getting a parking space.

Bryce is not really a canyon in the traditional sense but a series of rock amphitheaters each with its own overlook. There's a scenic drive on top of the plateau and stop at each overlook.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"LOVED, LOVED, LOVED! Amazing! Instead of giving the same accolades as everyone else... I'll try to give some tips.TIP #1: If you want to park your car [limited parking] at Sunset Point - do so before 7-8 am. Otherwise, save yourself time and aggravation by using the shuttle system. PARKING: We got last parking spot at 7 am at Sunset point. When we finished our hike around noon, people in cars were wearily trying to find parking. Park staff keeps folks moving along. They don't let you sit and wait for cars to leave. It blocks the flow of traffic for shuttles. And because there are hiking trailheads [very popular trails] from this spot, parking does NOT open up frequently. For reference, we were parked there for 4-5 hours for our hike. FYI: Most of the people there before 7 am looked to be hikers.Other parking/traffic: Bryce Point [short, must see, walk to overlook] parking seems to turn over fairly quickly. All the overlooks on the scenic drive, past Bryce Point, also seem to turn over fairly quickly. Natural Bridge is the most worthy feature on the scenic drive. Fairyland overlook, near the park entrance, seems to be ignored and is worth seeing. Very few people. Nice from that aspect alone. Amazing views. Saw deer on the way.TIP #2: If hiking Queens Garden Trail, take a minute to walk out on the horse trail that leads to Peek-a-boo Trail. Only need to go maybe 100 yards to see the most spectacular 360 view. You feel you are in the middle of the Canyon about 2/3rds of the way up. Easy walk. Away from crowds. TIP #3: Wear hiking shoes/boots with lugs. Lots of loose small rock, sand and dry soil on trails. Very easy to slip or slide. Especially in the Wall Street section where crowds are distracted and not paying attention to their surroundings or footing. You might be steady and balanced, but someone else in sandals or running shoes next to you, playing with a cell phone or camera often seem to lose their footing and bump into you.TIP #4: Camelbak.HIKING: We planned a hike on the Navajo Trail which starts at Sunset Point. It goes thru the very popular and crowded Wall Street section. Worth it! We then used Queens Garden Trail to gain access back up the rim to Sunrise Point. Then walked the rim between Sunrise and Sunset. We did counter-clockwise as easier coming back out of the canyon. Again, the short walk out onto the Horse Trail was worth it! Enjoy!","July 27, 2018","Must see!!! This review about TIPS; limited parking, crowds",40,"Atlanta, Georgia",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,Loved Bryce! Maybe my favorite NP! So beautiful and unique. Walking through the hoodoos makes you feel like you’re in another world.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"In Bryce Canyon National Park, we actually had two different experiences during our stay there. The first one was when we decided to wake up at 5.20 am, to watch the sunrise from 'sunrise point' in Bryce Canyon NP. We would definitely recommend this, as this is an unforgettable experience. The 'waking up'-part is difficult, but being there as you see the sunlight slowly reaching the rock formations of the NP absolutely makes up for the early awakening. Keep in mind that this is early in the morning, so the temperatures are only 'moderate'. Also, the spot is well-known among hikers, so make sure to be there on time if you want a nice photo/view.Our second experience with Bryce NP is the hike from Sunset point to Sunrise point. The nature that we saw there was simply mesmerizing. The walks between the rocky walls, the views, the rock formations and their interplay with the sun light, the path taking sharp turns deeper into the park (known as 'wallstreet')... All the natural beauty found in this park cannot be described using words or photos. Therefore I would certainly recommend every hiker that is considering to visit Bryce Canyon NP to do it. The park has a lot to offer, from amazing sunrises and sunsets to (sometimes challenging) hikes. The hike that we did was not particularly hard, but the climbing part at the end (the climb towards sunrise point) was a bit challenging considering the burning sun and the lack of wind. An absolute must visit for every nature -, and National Park enthusiast!","July 26, 2018",Unforgettable nature,12,"Flanders, Belgium",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce National Park offers scenery that’s feminine, soft, pink, and curvaceous. You can enjoy the park from the several viewpoints above. But to really experience the park’s magic, you have to go into the canyon. You can walk. It is a steep descent on unguarded narrow switch backs. I think the best way to experience the canyon is by mule or horse rides. I took a half day ride and it is unforgettable. I took lots of photos while my steed did all the work. Another must do at Bryce is to get up early and see the sunrise in the canyon. Again, go into the canyon. You can walk. You don’t have to go too far. Watch the hoodoos as the morning light hits them.

About the park, I could spend days writing about it. We live in Henderson NV, which is only a few hours drive from our home. When you get into the park, they also have free bus tours, that take you all over. They run approx 15 minutes apart, so you can stay at one location for as long as you like. There is a great visitors center that has a food area as well. There are also great hiking trails as well as places you can just sit and enjoy the views.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We spent a day here while staying in Kanab, which is about 90 minutes away from Bryce. Like Zion, they recommend parking in town and taking the shuttle to the park. We parked at the Shuttle Station stop, purchased our park admission and rode in. The shuttles runs very frequently and it was a very short wait. The first stop is the visitor center. We stopped to get trail advice, very good idea. Since we only had a day we did the combined Navajo Loop/Queen’s Garden trail. To make it easy on yourself, start at Navajo Loop, shortly after you start the trail, you have a left or right option. Go right, it is steep with a lot of switchbacks, but the way out is easier at the end. The trail is well marked and you end at Sunset Point. Take the path on the right for a short walk to Shuttle Stop 8. This trail allows you to see many “sides” of the canyon - hop-doos, rocks that almost look like sand, a slot canyon and huge pines.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Pictures simply do not put this place into perspective. I have seen many pictures of Bryce over the years and I had something different (not completely, of course) in my mind. But when I saw this place in person, it was that much more amazing to me how close these hoodoos (rock formation) are to you. You can make this a short trip and take a very short distance (maybe 100 yards) from the parking lot to the rim and have an overview of the beauty, or make a full day out of it exploring the bottom. I agree with other reviewers that the hike down in is steep and you should be prepared to hike back the same steepness (I included a picture of the elevation loss/gain). I hiked this after running a half marathon (13.1 miles). Trekking poles may help with the elevation loss and gain, but not required. Hiking shoes are recommended, but not required. There are signs suggesting that as well. I saw people hiking in their Chacos. I saw families hiking with young children. The path is wide and well groomed.We parked near Sunrise Point and did the Queens/Navajo Loop to Sunset Point (as recommended and rated most popular by the Bryce Canyon Map and Guide. Yes, there were a lot of people, but going there expecting that didn't seem to be that bad. We had to wait a few times for people to take their pictures along the path and for us to get a few shots in, but not terrible.If you are a trail runner, I thought it would be a little too steep (for my taste) both down and up. We did run some of it, but the motivation was primarily due to a thunderstorm that was rolling in (we got out just before it started to pour rain).","July 16, 2018",Touched by the Hand of God!,19,"Orem, Utah",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is the first time we visited Bryce Canyon and we had imagined it as big, but comparatively it is small. Nevertheless stunning rock formations. There are viewpoints throughout and those are great to capture pictures. The shuttle system at Bryce is simple and convenient, but it is better to drive in the park. We were passing by and just had couple of hours, which was sufficient to cover all the viewpoints but then the entrance fee is very expensive for just the drive through. Later checking online it looks this place is not fully worth if not doing the trails, so may be next time.","July 15, 2018","Not Worth If not doing trails, except if passing by!!",14,"Phoenix, Arizona",4

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I was a bit apprehensive visiting Bryce after visiting Zion since I thought it would be a let down. Man, was I wrong! Bryce Canyon is amazing and unique! The best view is the one by the lodge. However, to truly see the NP's beauty, you must go into the amphitheater. I took the Queens/Navajo loop trail twice. At the bottom of the canyon you are in a forest. The unique colors of the Canyon and trees make it incredibly beautiful. One bit of advice - start the trail at the Queens trailhead and walk up Wall Street. Too perfect!! We stayed two nights in Bryce. We got there in the afternoon and took a hike that evening. The next day, we took an early morning hike. Went back to the hotel to swim and that evening went back and visited all the viewpoints and took the hike at the furthest viewpoint(Bristlestone or something like that). One night, we went into the park to look at stars - oh man!!! Too many.","July 15, 2018",WOW,31,"Arlington, Texas",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce is really unique and definitely worth the trip. It's at a higher elevation and therefore not as hot as Zion, which was refreshing. I felt like I really saw the whole park. I started by skipping past the crowds at the visitor's center and driving all the way to the end of the park, which is about 17 miles. The road dead-ends at a parking lot where you can see Rainbow and Yovimpa Points and do the Bristlecone Loop 1 mile hike. Once you turn around and head back, all of the viewpoints are on the ride side of the road and easy to pull in to. I stopped at all of the ones that looked interesting (most of them), such as Natural Bridge, and did a few short hikes. Bryce may not be as crowded overall as Zion, but the viewpoints nearer to the visitor's center (Sunset and Inspiration Points) are really crowded. I wanted to get down into the hoodoos, partly for the experience and partly to get away from the hordes, so I did the Peekabo Loop Trail, which was about 5 miles. It was scenic and completely doable for anyone with a modicum of fitness. Any hike you do into the canyon requires you to walk all the way down first, so as long as you're mentally prepared to come all the way back up, you should be fine. I had a little time the next morning, so I also did part of the Fairyland Loop Trail. I found that incredibly enjoyable, and it was much less crowded than the other areas.","July 13, 2018",Really Cool Park,39,"Charleston, South Carolina",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited seven national parks/monuments over the last week and a half, and we absolutely loved Bryce Canyon! It was much less crowded than Zion and about 15 degrees cooler. The hoodoos were different from what we saw at other parks and were simply incredible. Our family of five (kids aged 15, 12 and 6) did the Navajo Loop hike, which I highly recommend! You get a nice overlook and then hike into the hoodoos. There’s a really neat section called “Wall Street” that goes through a slot canyon. There’s not much shade and quite a strenuous uphill climb on your exit, so bring water and definitely wear sturdy, non-slip shoes. It was fine for our 6-year old. We also drove the rest of the scenic loop and had a picnic at the end of it. While there are lots of picnic tables there, they are not in a very interesting area. In hindsight, Sunset or Sunrise Point might have been better for that. Don’t miss the film in the Visitor’s Center that plays on the hour and half-hour! Also, if you visit during the summer monsoon months, you should go early...they have to close the canyon area if there’s lightening in the area, which seems to happen a lot in the afternoon.Don’t miss this park! You could experience it in a couple hours if you’re short on time. ","July 12, 2018",Wow! A must-see! ,13,,5

You can see about half the park's main attractions using the shuttle which is nice. If you are short on time, that is a good way to do it.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We have been to this park during different seasons. It always has much to offer, and great views in all seasons. I personally find it looks best in mid April when there is snow on the Hoodoos and the sky has a lot more color to it. June is different, but also enjoyable, although it is much more crowded!This time we did both, drive to all the viewing pull off points, and ride the Shuttle Buses. They are great! But if you want to shoot sunrise or sunset pictures, you have to drive your own vehicle because the buses only run from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M.If you want to hike, you should think twice about whether you are capable of doing the 1/2 mile trail between Sunrise Point and Sunset Point. I see it is sometimes listed as paved and ""easy"". It is not paved, and it can be dangerous since it has no guard rails along the cliff side!The Visitor Center is small. Bryce Lodge is a historic old building, and there is a gift shop with a decent gift shop and restaurant there. There is also a General Store in near the north campground which sells good ice cream by the cup or cone.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We loved our visit to Bryce National Park. There is no denying that this is a busy National Park. We had recently been to Capital Reef park and so in comparison, this park seemed crowded. But, when we arrived, we were still able to park in the parking lot at Sunset Trail our first day. Our second day, we parked near the lodge. Once parked, here are my recommendations: 1) Take the shuttle to the spots where you want to hike. The shuttle goes in a loop and picks you up within a 10 minute wait (during normal daylight hours) and takes you wherever you want to go. It is very convenient and parking does fill up. If you ever cannot find parking, there is always parking somewhere around the Bryce Lodge and Cabins. 2) We started at the Sunset to Sunrise hike on the Rim Trail. This is an easy hike and it is paved. This is accessible to anyone and you can see the entire canyon. Anyone of any ability, if they only do one hike or only have one view into the park, this is their hike. It can be only one mile total and can take as long as you would like it to. When you are done, you can go to the lodge for drinks and souvenir shopping. If you would like to do more, there are other great hikes, most of them taking you to other ends of the canyon to look into it or further into the canyon. 3) We really liked Inspiration Point which has three levels of height to its hikes and the Navajo Loop Trail. 4) If you do Navajo Loop, it is best at the start or end of the day because it gets hot and crowded, but it was one of my favorite hikes of our two week trip to seven National Parks. Really worthwhile. 5) We stayed at the Bryce Cabins in the park, which were also a highlight but need to be booked at least six months in advance. It is worthwhile just to be able to walk out of your cabin and be a few feet away from the canyon edge and the Rim Trail. 6) We sat between Sunset and Sunrise on the Rim Trail at sunrise one of our mornings, which is a real treat.

At the end it sits around 9000 feet in elevation and there are many tables to enjoy lunch on. Make sure you do the entire drive and stop at the turnouts. The hiking can be as long or short as you desire. This park sits at a higher elevation than all the other Nat. Parks in Utah so the temps. here are much cooler.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I recommend Queens Garden and the Peekaboo Loop if you are up for a moderately strenuous hike. The loop has ups and downs interspersed, so the elevation gain is spread throughout the hike. We also drive to each of the scenic viewpoints which was a good use of time. Queens Garden gives you the biggest bang for your buck in my opinion.","July 1, 2018","Very unique canyon, tons of hoodoos!",9,"Sacramento, California",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"This park is amazing from the vistas to the hikes. Trails are challenging—easy doesn’t mean a walk.

Having traveled much of the world, I cannot think of another landscape anywhere that is quite as unusual as this one.We were there on May 31st and it was quite cold and windy in the upper elevations. There was still snow on the ground in shaded spots. The conditions made it quite uncomfortable for prolonged gazing. Our previous visit was in September, which was far more comfortable. Given the opportunity, I wouldn't return until aa few weeks later in June.You can use the free shuttle buses throughout the park, but we chose to drive our own car.

You definitely must do the Navajo Loop Trail in combination with the Queen's Garden Trail. This goes counter-clockwise through the valley with the steep part first descending downward into the canyon and a gradual ascent at the end. Walking sticks are very helpful for balance and take a couple of bottles of water, trail mix and beef jerky (optional). These 2 trails will take you a casual 3 hours or more. Make sure you have lots of camera memory and possibly a backup battery (don't forget the cable). The park definitely got more crowded and the day progressed.

Includes a picnic table and fire ring.Toilet and Showers are close by.Started the day in the amphitheater. That has left me speechless and I was eager to see more.Sunrise/Sunset point is very hectic. Finding a parking spot, means you might need to circle a few times. Be patient. Most of the visitors don't walk the entire trail that's offered.First trail was a little over 10 miles. Started at Sunrise point, Queen's Garden, Tropic trail, PeekABoo loop (anti clockwise), Navajo and finished at Sunset point.It's not an easy hike, but worth every step.Wear long clothes - the soil is like powder and sticks to everything.Next day I drove to all the view points. Agua Canyon, Rainbow Point, Ponderosa Point, Natural Bridge, Fairview Point and did one Loop Trail, Sheep Creek and Swamp Canyon. Got a little lost there with the Rim Trail. Make sure u have a map or direction, so u don't get lost like me .Last day I drive to Mossy Cave, which is outside the Park.

Plenty of places to pull off and look around / take photos. * The temps were warm but were MUCH cooler at the top as well as windy, so be aware.* Wildlife everywhere so be careful driving through. They will walk out in front of you!* If you want to get out and hike, be aware that if you are afraid of heights, or have limited mobility, the drive might be better for you. There are steep drop-offs, lots of switch backs and a big difference in height from top to bottom. Still a wonderful way to see the park.* If you are going to more than two National Parks, get a season pass at the gate or online for $ 80 as it is $35 per car at each park. It's good for a year at any National Park and could save you money in the long run.* Awesome place for night / astro photography. Scout some locations during the day and get back there before dark.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We were in the area for our daughters wedding and decided to stick around for a week afterward to explore some nearby National Parks. For the first time. We stayed in Kanab and that worked as an excellent starting point for several parks. We went to Bryce after having visited Zion the day before. There are clear differences in the landscape/features of each park, as well as the experience you will have while there in relation to other visitors. Zion at times is like an amusement park in terms of lines/crowds when compared to Bryce. That doesn’t mean Bryce is sparsely visited, and as such a plan is a good idea. We are not “serious” hikers, were looking to do shorter (easier) hikes. We arrived at the park at 7:30 AM and found plenty of parking in the Sunset Point lot. This allowed us to hike the Navajo Loop trail while it was still cool. While we were, we hiking made a decision do break away from the Navajo loop and head toward Queen’s Garden and climb out via Sunrise Point. This was due to the steepness of the trail coming down from Sunset. This made for a longer hike but most of it was in the amphitheater and was easier walking. Walking in the basin of this amphitheater was amazing, a different perspective than from above. We headed back to the parking lot and dove to the visitors center, From there we took the shuttle to Bryce Point and Inspiration Point. After a short lunch at our car, we drove the full length of the park to Rainbow Point, then worked our way back, stopping at the pullouts and overlooks (which are all on the right side when driving back). We were finished by 3PM. This approach seemed to put us ahead of the crowds (Sunset Point lot was full later in the day).The views are spectacular and the land features unique.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"What no one will tell you about Zion is that it is the Disney World of our National Parks. That means it is so incredibly popular, you WILL endure V E R Y L O N G L I N E S just waiting for the park's shuttle system to take you to trail heads. And by the time you get to the trail, a couple of hours will have passed and the heat will be EXTREME. There is another option! Bryce Canyon is only 70 miles away (1 hour 20 minutes). We felt as if we had entered another world as we entered Bryce. There were so few people, we thought this park must not be so great or it would be busier. We were SO WRONG! Bryce Canyon unlike ANYTHING you have ever seen, guaranteed! It is absolutely incredible 'you have to see it to experience it' natural phenomenon of thousands of 'hoodoos' rising up to the sky. Herein lies the largest collection of hoodoos IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. A hoodoo is a collection of spikey spheres of eroded rock formations. The views and the hiking are simply magical. Other-worldly! We hiked several of the interior trails, all with our 9 year old leading the way. His imagination led him to think of the term 'real life Legos!"" on the Fairy Land Trail. We arrived mid-day and were able to get in three hikes of varying distances. You will need water, sunscreen, hiking shoes (or shoes with good grippers on the soles), and a hat, preferably with an elongated back to protect from the unmerciful sun. There are long stretches on the hikes in the shade. It is QUIET as the still of night in the middle of no where in Bryce.

We recommend the shuttle. The shuttle drivers were friendly and informative and seemed like they liked interacting with visitors. We marveled at the view below us at Inspiration Point and walked on the rim trail to Sunset point where we descended into the canyon via switchbacks to “Wall Street”. My wife is 67, and I am 72, but we did find the way down treacherous or taxing. Make sure we wear shoes with good ankle support. We passed some young adults with flip flops, and they had their problems when it came time to walk back up to the rim trail. We walked past vertical walls on either side of the Navajo Loop Trail before we reached the bottom of the canyon at South Hall. We paused for rest and water and were amazed to hear other visitors speaking Dutch, French, German, Chinese and Czech. I speak German well, and I spoke German almost every day during our two-week national park tour. Everyone loves our National Parks!

Bryce has 65 miles of trails, most of which are accessible for day hikers. You'll want to see them all. And you'll want to walk them slowly, because every inch is spectacular. Mid-June advice: sunhat, sunscreen, good shoes, bug spray is not needed. Had no trouble finding parking spots arriving before 8am - you might need the shuttle if you come late morning or later. Would not recommend for children - they just won't appreciate this kind of beauty.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"My two brothers and I stopped here for two sunsets and two sunrises, each from a different location and each was special in its own way. First sunset was from Sunset point and we were surprised that it was not very crowded (perhaps it was still early in the season) - you can read my review under ""Sunset Point"". Next morning's sunrise was from Bryce Point - that was probably the best place to view the amphitheater from. We got there about 45 minutes before sunrise and had no problem finding spots to set up our tripods BUT remember to dress warmly - it was cold. After sunrise, we proceeded to Paria View and that offered special views of its own. For sunset we went to Inspiration Point (at the highest lookout) and I used a telephoto lens to isolate features in the amphitheater - very different from using a wide angle lens the previous day. The next morning we hiked part way down the Fairyland Trail and each of us picked a spot from which to capture images. Since we hiked part way down the trail, we were shooting across to the rocks instead of shooting down from the previous three locations. A different perspective that we enjoyed. The park is a simply amazing place and a must visit if you are in the area.","June 18, 2018",Simply Amazing,102,"Mesquite, Nevada",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,This is a really nicely maintained national park. The restrooms were clean and the trails were well maintained. It appears that the visitors center is powered by solar. I didn’t get to ask but I noticed a huge mobile panel outside. I stopped at the scenic viewpoints on my first day. I came back a second day and did the Bristlecone Pine trail. I stopped back by the Natural Bridge site as the clouds and lighting offered a more dynamic view compared with the day before. I then drive down to the “Amphitheater” and did the Navajo/Wall Street trail starting at Sunset Point to the Queens Court to Thor’s Hammer and then on up to Sunrise Point. It was a really scenic hike and not too difficult. The most difficult part is the ascending climb at he end. I was there during the start of the Astronomy Festival. People with telescopes come at Night and set up telescopes and they allow people to look through them and see the stars. It was super cool! I saw Jupiter and Saturn with its rings. I also saw a few other galaxies and a star nebulous. ,"June 17, 2018",Do the Hoodoos!,22,"Los Angeles, California",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"It’s a great park to visit and see this incredible place. Admission fee is $30/car and they provide u with good maps and info. You can also take the Bryce shuttle for free with pick up locations outside the park. You can hop on and off. If you are planning to go and stay inside the park I recommend you reserve on line as soon as possible. The Cabin was my favorite though the motel room is also fine. The rooms do not have air conditioning but it gets very cool at nite so leave the windows open. There was a fire place in cabin but we didn’t use it. Coffee pot with coffee and cream and sugar packs were included. Our 2 double bed cabin was very clean and rustic. A nice closet had a sink and vanity with hair dryer. Cabin had a nice full bathroom. Nice high ceiling fan. Also a little porch to sit and relax. There are cabins close to the rim, maybe 100 yards at the most. Which come in very handy. We spent 2 days. Best advice is to get up early and get started before the crowds. I was up for a sunrise hike by myself. Very safe lots of folks around. We drove our car out to the furthest - Rainbow point. Ate our breakfast in a little shelter situated at the rim as it was windy and a little chilly in early am. We. Walked bristlecone trail. Visited Yovinpa Point and did part of Riggs spring Loop Trail. Spectacular views. We stopped at all the scenic overlooks on the way back. A few have short hikes you can take (they connect to under the rim trail farther down). This was a good plan for first day to get acclimated to the park. Early Next day we did the Navajo ( Wall Street is a must) and Queens trail. Ate our breakfast during a rest stop. Both moderate trails. Make sure to take water and snacks as a leisurely pace can take several hours. Trails are marked and in good shape. We wore sturdy sneakers and did fine. Both trails can be very dusty so a bandanna can come in handy. We ate in the lodge both nights early. They Do not take reservations. Food was very good. A tad on high side. There is a casual pizza place near the lodge as well and other places outside the park. We brought snacks, water etc with us into the park so did not visit the general store. It was hot during the day and cold at nite and early am so dress in layers and bring sunscreen and a hat. The sun is very intense. Hope this is helpful and you enjoy your visit.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is what I did for a complete afternoon. I decided to shuttle in from Ruby's at about Noon. So I took the shuttle to Bryce Point. You can drive to the points but I wanted to walk and go along the rim from Bryce Point to Sunset Point and then back to the Visitor Center, where I caught the shuttle back to Ruby's just before 5 PM. If you do this, be aware that much of the trail is on gravel or dirt and there is a bit of uphill walking, but not much. The views on the walk are amazing and varied. By walking you can stop anywhere on the rim to see amazing vistas and take photos and videos. This walk will pass the other rim views accessible by both the shuttle and auto. You can even do more than this by taking the rim trail farther to Fairyland Point. But I hadn't the time. The Fairyland loop is another option. It will take you down from the rim into the canyons and then up again. You can begin the access here either at Sunrise Point or Fairyland which is outside the park entry and not accessed via the shuttle. Lots of people do one of the loop canyon trails down and up from Sunset Point. You can also drive out farther to other viewpoints, such as Rainbow. The shuttle does not continue this way. But sometimes with your own vehicle, you can meet a ranger at Rainbow Point for a day hike. Refreshments on this walk are either at the Visitor Center or the Lodge area by Sunset Point. So don't walk without drink and food to chomp on.","June 14, 2018",Well Worth Taking A Rim Walk,677,"Henderson, Nevada",5

I would advise getting an annual pass if going to multiple US national parks (cost US80). The line up wasn’t to bad.There was buses available to visit the canyon, but we used our car and found parking available. Albeit I don’t think we were at the park anywhere near peak!The natural beauty of Bryce is just amazing. We walked the Navajo Loop which was a demanding hike but worth it for the views.Probably not a hike you should do if your don’t have a medium level of fitness.However you still get amazing views from the top of the canyon.We probably should have spent a little more time in this park, but we still had a two hour drive to St George.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Very nice spot can be overshadowed by all the other great stuff in the area but worth a visit check out some view points and go for a hike down into the hoodoos and along the cliffs. 2 days was enough for us although I’m sure there was some nice trails we missed out on.,"June 4, 2018",Unique place ,1,"Dartmouth, Canada",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Want a challenging hike or just a stroll? You can see some of the best amphitheaters here even if you're in a wheelchair or hobbling on crutches. The most popular trail from Sunrise to Inspiration is accessible and even allows dogs. You can go into the canyons from there, but you don't have to - you'll get a great view from almost any point. If you're like me and can't handle steep downhills, do the rest of the Rim Trail - the less traveled part. Park (or shuttle) to the other parts and get new views that are amazing. There's no bad hikes here. And don't miss the top - it's a bit taxing at 9300 ft, but worth the drive. Take a picnic or buy one at the camp store - plenty of places to sit and enjoy the view. And bring your camera.","June 3, 2018",Amazing at all Times of the Day,141,"Walnut Creek, California",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,Bryce and the Grand Canyon were definitely my favorites of all of the Canyons we visited! The colors and sandstone at Bryce are surreal! The smooth rock and deep Canyons are hard to walk away from. I could not take enough pictures while we were here! The hike down to the bottom is SO worth it (but beware it is a very Steep hike; 1 mile straight down. We passed many people throwing up and having trouble breathing; a medi-vac helicopter was also there picking up people!) ,"June 1, 2018",MY FAVORITE!,69,"Newburgh, New York",5

We eat very clean and prefer to pack our breakfast and lunch. Restaurants are very limited in the area. There are a couple lodges that serve dinner. The restaurant in the park is delicious, but a little expensive. We hiked the Navajo Loop combined with Queen’s Garden which is a must see! The park is so much more beautiful from below! We started on the Navajo Loop which meant we were going down the switchbacks, instead of up. You don’t need to use the shuttle, at least not in May. We drove to each overlook.

Staring from the queen's garden trail provides plenty of shade, so it was quite easy and not too hot. We did part of the peekaboo trail, but the sun was just too intense for pregnant women like me! The sunset at the sunset point wasn't too impressive because it was cloudy, but we stayed a little later and saw the moon risen from the canyon. It was very cool!

Its lots of fun trying to locate different points of attraction during the hikes such as wall of windows in peekaboo loop, two bridges in Navajo loop, and THE queen herself in queen's loop.

We drove the 16 miles to Yovimpa Point and hiked the Bristlecone Loop Trail. Then we made our way back and stopped at all the different points for more wonderful views. The weather was rainy off and on so we couldn't hike as many trails. However, did manage a hike at Inspiration Point and Sunrise Point down the Amphitheater to see several bridges and Queen Victoria. The rain made for a few beautiful rainbows. Coming from Hawaii where rainbows are a common occurrence, these were some of the most beautiful we've seen.We loved this park and would visit again if we get the chance.","May 28, 2018",Hoodoos!,24,"Berkeley, California",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon National Park surprised me, because I was thinking that something most impressive and beautiful like Grand Canyon it can't be.This park is situated in the South of Utah, and his name came from the man who built his house near the area - Ebenezer Bryce.Actually, what I saw in this park isn't some canyons, as I have learned at the school.Here I saw many amphitheaters with the weirdest relief shape, you can imagine.Also, the color of the rocks are amazing - white, red, orange, so on.With the tourist bus, I climbed from an observation point to another, from 8000 feet (2400 meters) to almost 9000 feet (2700 meters).The spectacles from every observation point are fantastic - maybe Bryce Point to overcome the other points - Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration. That's because the Bryce Point being the highest observation point (8800 feet - 2640 meters) dominate the all ensemble of the amphitheaters.Sometime, I believed to see some castles, towers, soldiers, hammers, so on, in all color tones.The feeling with what I stared at this kind of miracles was impressive.","May 28, 2018",An unespected pleasant surprise,225,"Ploiesti, Romania",5

Weather in Bryce can be unpredictable because of the elevation, we had hail, snow and rain in a matter of 15mins. Obviously, one day was not enough, we hope to be back in future to do other trails.

We road to the Bryce overlook, which was the shuttle's last stop, and walked over the rim to the peekaboo trail. It took us 3.5 hours to walk it. Fairly strenuous but breathtaking. If you start from the last stop like we did when you get to the peekaboo loop stay left for the best views then catch the Navajo trail back up to the rim. Take it slow, bring a walking stick, make sure your shoes fit. The down and uphill can crunch your toes into the front of your shoes if they don't and you sure don't want blisters... Take water.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We spent 24 hours at Bryce Canyon. Upon arrival, we drove the scenic drive out to Inspiration Point. Stunning views. We also stopped at the Natural Bridge scenic pulloff. It was worth the stop. Beautiful. From there, we headed to the main lodge to check in. We opted to stay the night to see the night skies and the sunrise over the amphitheater. After check in, we hiked the Queens Garden and Navajo loop trails. A very fun hike, but not for the weak. The hike down and back up is strenuous, but we enjoyed all the fun twists and turns within the amphitheather. Viewing the hoodoos, walking through the arches, it was nature's art, and it was fantastic! We stayed in the sunrise building just outside the main lodge. We were within 100 yards of the amphitheater so we went out late night to see the stars and again at sunrise to see the sun come up over the amphitheater. Many other reviews said the sunset and sunrise was a critical part of experiencing Bryce, but I am not in that category. It was fine, but if I had to do again, I could have spent 6-8 hours at Bryce and moved on. I didn't feel I saw anything different at sunset or sunrise that I didn't already see during the day. I would say get there early in the day and move to your next destination by late afternoon. If you do decide to stay, I recommend Bryce Canyon Lodge for food. We had dinner and breakfast there. Both were fantastic!","May 18, 2018",Great place to spend a day!,67,"Grandville, MI",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We stayed at Bryce Canyon Lodge during our visit and it was great (separate review for the Lodge).We parked at Ruby's Inn, bought our passes and took the free shuttle into the park. We decided to do the moderate Navajo trail and added Peekaboo at the suggestion of a fellow traveller. The views were spectacular. We passed through wind tunnels and got unfiltered views of the hoodoos. This trek is not for the weak-hearted. It is strenuous and has sudden elevation changes. Carry plenty of water and snacks and take frequent breaks. Dress in layers as it gets warm and cold and the weather changes are as confusing as the elevation changes. We finished the hike in under 2 hours and slept for 4 hours after that. Yes, it was that strenuous.Ok, I am sure everyone is curious to know what the meh was - the shuttle driver asked everyone where they were from. There was a couple from CA. He said to them- hey people around here dislike you guys, so if someone stops you, just say you are from elsewhere. He repeated it again in case they had not heard him the first time. As they got off he told them not to feed the bears. Even the guy from France who spoke in monosyllables got love :-((Sorry shuttle driver - you had something nice to say about everyone except CA.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We arrived at Bryce Canyon after a 2 hour drive from Zion. We parked up at the handy shuttle car park in Bryce (it’s a small place, you can’t miss it). From there we used our $80 National Parks annual pass to board a shuttle bus free of charge and it took us into the park. We got dropped off at the visitor centre, watched a 20 minute film about how the park was formed and then headed to the 4 key points of the park as highlighted by their website. These points are Bryce Point, Inspiration Point, Sunset Point and Sunrise Point. We took a shuttle to Bryce Point first, where we walked a part of the upper rim trail before heading back to the shuttle. We then headed for inspiration point and walked from there back to the Visitor Centre (stopping off at the General Store at Sunrise Point for food on the way). This whole trek took about 4 hours and it wasn’t strenuous at all. There are more strenuous hikes available for hardened walkers but that’s not us!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"My husband and I look forward to eating at Bryce Canyon Lodge Dining Room each time we visit Bryce. This latest visit was disappointing. The Dining Room still has a very nice atmosphere, but the food was absolutely sub-par compared to prior visits. Our bread was cold and tasted stale. The salad was not fresh. The main course of salmon was served along with bland mixed vegetables and rice, colorless, no garnish. It was not attractively served. We take responsibility for the dry, overcooked salmon, as we like our fish cooked through, not translucent. Our waiter was rushed, he misunderstood our wine request and he seemed upset that we asked him to bring us the correct wine. Last year we had a waiter who was obviously very experienced and made the dining experience much more pleasant for us. Also, (and certainly not the fault of the hotel), there was an extremely loud guest holding forth at an adjoining table, who probably ruined several other guests' dinner. A solution to this problem could be requiring resort casual dress, no t-shirts and flip flops. People who dress better, behave better. This would be more apropos for a classic old lodge dining experience. Frankly, the entire ambiance of the hotel has changed. No cozy fire in the fireplace, even though it was a chilly evening, the lights were way too bright in the lobby, and outside terraces very, very dark. Softer lighting inside and lamps on the outside terraces would improve the charm of the place considerably. We stayed here several years ago, but switched to a different hotel in the last couple of years, so cannot report on the rooms. Also, want to mention that when you walk into the lobby, the desk clerks do not look up to greet the guests. Very cool welcome indeed for guests who want to spend money in your establishment!","May 6, 2018",Not Up to Standard,146,"Greenville, SC",3

And it is steep, with high altitude, and is tough for us normal folks!! Take several bottles of water, several snacks, hiking poles might be helpful if you have some, but not needed. There are plenty of places to stop, lean, sit....or flat out lay down if needed. Haha. But Holy Hoodoo’s, this place is an amazing display of nature at its best!! I think these formations rank 2nd only my favorite Sequoia Trees in Yosemite!! I would be careful with young children, if they are not good at staying close, and listening....there are monster sized cliffs and drop offs, and loose gravel that could be slippery if they are running or roughhousing.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Hubby and I visited this beautiful national park in early April. The weather was cool, with snow and wind one day. Hiking was comfortable, however, with layering. The sights and hoodoos are amazing. To truly appreciate the beauty, one must hike down into the canyon, although there is a well maintained road running the length of the canyon. The trails are wide and well groomed. There are a variety of trail lengths and difficulty. All are well documented in the park newspaper. Be sure to carry water as this is a desert region. Maps of the trails are available at the Welcome Center. You can also speak with a ranger about various hikes within the park and at nearby state parks and national forest facilities. There are many educational displays in the center and a well stocked store. Ranger talks are scheduled daily, more so as the weather warms up. The rangers are friendly and very knowledgeable. Free bus service to town begins April 13. We stayed in the park at the lodge. It was pricy, but comfortable and well worth the cost to be within walking distance of trails and the restaurant. It was also more relaxed and less touristy than Ruby’s, although Ruby’s has an amazing store. (Were warned by multiple people to avoid the restaurant at Ruby’s) At in the lodge restaurant, service was quick and friendly and the food was delicious. Also ate at Bryce Canyon Pines, outside of the park. The Pines lived up to the praises we heard from everyone recommending an off site restaurant. Pie at the pines is amazing! Spring and fall are much less crowded at Bryce than summer. Also found the park less crowded than Zion National Park. We spent three days hiking within the park, another visiting nearby trails outside of the main entrance. Weather did not cooperate for a sunset view of the canyon. We had heard how spectacular sunsets were from numerous people. A wonderful experience.","May 1, 2018",Bryce Canyon National Park experience,15,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We were in Bryce in late April - it was pretty cold and windy (I wore winter gloves one morning and was glad I packed all the winter stuff I didn't need in Moab.) We just happened to see a tour the afternoon we arrived and were driving around the park on our own. We found out it is a completely free bus tour that is part of the Park - it runs once in the morning and once in the afternoon for about 40 people - first come, first served. You must call to make a reservation - information in the Bryce NP website. It does not go through all the park sights but hits many of the major ones and lasts about 3 hours depending on where you are picked up. As an adjunct to doing parts of the park on your own - I highly recommend it for the information the guide provides and the opportunity to let someone else do the driving so you can just enjoy the views. The tour stops at about 6 spots for photos and some walking along with information about the park from the guide/driver. April was our guide, who is a local and a fountain of knowledge about the park (and tells a few really awful jokes.)","May 1, 2018",Rainbow Point Tour,54,South Carolina,5

If the parking at sunrise and sunset points are close, park at the SUNSET LODGE. the lodge has extra parking and is between sunrise and sunset points. 3. Enjoy the hike on the rim at different Scenic points around the Canyon as it look different from each of the points.4. We did not hike all the way down but Go down from Sunset and come back up from sunrise that is better. 5. The hike is moderate not easy.6.

You begin to wonder whether the architects of the fabulous castles and cathedrals in Europe somehow drew their inspiration from these natural wonders. The color is constantly changing with the movement of the sun. The hike down into the canyon is moderate and only takes about 1.5 hours; a bit strenuous on the way up. The park has a lot of nice viewing spots you can reach by car or shuttle; it is a very expansive park but the primary hike is in a central area near the Lodge. You can easily see Bryce on a day trip, unlike Zion, which can keep you entertained with hikes for days; but it is worth seeing because it is so unusual.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Many travelers, ourselves included, plan Bryce Canyon as a ""day trip"" from Zion. What a mistake we made. First off, it takes about 2 hours to get there, after you get through the main entrance of Zion. It is an absolutely incredible drive, for sure, but you can't get to Bryce early enough to catch the sunrise over the amphitheater or try to get ahead of the crowds. (Sunset would have been an option, but did not relish the idea of navigating the windy canyon roads after dark.) Definitely not as crowded as Zion, but the most popular trail, Navajo Loop, was jammed at 930 AM on a Thursday in April (see separate review.) After our hike, we drove further into the park, and the traffic thinned out considerably. There are so many wonderful hikes at Bryce with views that are incredible and vastly different than Bryce. Red Canyon State Park down the road also looks amazing.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce wasn't the first park that popped into my head when thinking about National Parks, but it definitely is now on the top of my favorite parks list. My husband and I spent a day and a half at this park and I loved every moment of it.The sunrise at Bryce Point was just amazing, it's definitely inspiring and relaxing to see the sun come up and change the appearance of the hoodoos in the Bryce Amphitheater. We didn't get to see the sunset, but I think it would've been equally as amazing. I loved Inspiration Point and the Natural Bridge, just standing there in the serene stillness and thinking about how these natural pieces were formed was very special. It's not a very big park and it's definitely doable in a day. If you get a chance, stop by the visitors center and speak to the ranger to ask about Sunsets and Sunrise and their recommendations of where to go. Getting those tips, definitely made the visit so much easier and catching everything we wanted to see.Since Bryce Canyon is out in the middle of no where and the closest town is about 30 minutes away, you may want to consider bringing food and snacks.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Like most of our National Parks, this one gets crowded. Bring along your patience and consideration of others. When you arrive at the park you are given a map. If you have not made any plans while in the park prior to arriving, you will want to spend some time looking at the map and determining what your goals are while you are there. If you have minimal amount of time in Bryce you will probably want to catch as many of the major viewpoints as possible. If you have more time, you may want to walk or hike one of the many trails in the park. Some trails are easy and others require some serious effort. Choose a trail that works for you. We had a short day and a half in the area and immediately set out goals on seeing all the vista points. We drove to each location and experienced only some minor difficulties with parking. If a parking area is full, move on to the next viewpoint. Don't waste time waiting for a parking spot. The Sunrise and Sunset vista points are the most and consistently crowded. There are great trails at these locations and I would advise you to get there early. Some of the trails here are up to 8 miles. You can understand that people who park here may be there for the entire day. Parking spots may open up but they are few and far between. Each view is unique in it's own way and worthy of a stop. We chose to take the Bristlecone Trail which is at the highest elevation in the park. The trail is partially paved and does have some inclines but for the most part this is an easy trail. It's about 1 - 1 1/2 mile loop and offers some amazing views. Take this trail at a leisurely pace and enjoy the scenery at every turn. It is spectacular. Bring along lots of water and if it's sunny, some sun screen and a wide brim hat are advisable. Some areas offer some views that may cause a little anxiety for someone who has a fear of heights. Just look the other way in those areas and you will be fine. I tried to capture many of these areas in photos but nothing compares to being physically present in the surroundings.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Since the Civilian Conservation Corps labored during the 1930s to build tourism infrastructure in this remote National Park, Bryce Canyon has been among the most popular, with good reason. Seeing photos simply can't do it justice. There's something inexplicably moving about confronting the palette of dramatic colors, the variety of stone textures and the sheer drama of vistas from the rim of the canyon.The popularity of Bryce Canyon is both its blessing and its curse. The park is among the best organized in the country, with outstanding, efficient, frequent and environmentally friendly free shuttle service to every major vista point. But the park's popularity also means it gets crowded in summer. We visited in April, after the spring break rush, which proved a good time to be at Bryce. The traffic pattern for personal vehicles is likewise well planned. I strongly recommend driving to the southernmost viewpoint upon entering the park, then working your way northward again through the day, because all the viewpoints are along the northbound traffic lane. Hiking trail markings are clear, and there are trails suitable for every fitness level, from multi-day backpacking adventures to less-than-a-mile strolls along paved and level paths... all with incredible views and countless memorable photo opportunities. The visitors center is small, but highly informative; rangers smilingly answer the same questions day-after-day from visitors, and a variety of publications offer more than enough information about the park for anyone from a casual tourist to a scientific expert. Enormous new solar panels outside the visitors center follow the sun and offer an up-close lesson to youngsters about renewable energy.We especially enjoyed an easy 1-mile morning walk along Bristlecone Loop at the far southern viewpoint, where stunning high-level views of the canyon were interspersed with tranquil pine forest scenes in an area devastated by fire in 2009. On this walk, you'll see a living Bristlecone tree that's 1,600 years old! Don't miss the Bryce Amphitheater, either; it's not a ""theater,"" but an enormous stone formation comprised of thousands of multicolor ""hoodoos."" Inspiration Point offers both a short, easy walk and a strenuous climb to an even higher overlook. Natural Bridge is famous for its huge red arch formation, but equally impressive are the views from Bryce Point and Paria View.The park offers camping and a lodge, but limited facilities are booked up months - or a year - in advance. It's very possible to ""do"" Bryce Canyon in a single day, as long as you stick to the rim viewpoints and are not planning any of the arduous, long hikes. Bring lunch, if you can. Food service is somewhat limited. If you can swing it, try staying for dinner at the Bryce Canyon Lodge; the dining room does not offer any views of the canyon, but the food and service is quite good, if on the pricey side.Bryce Canyon National Park is among the most expensive in the system, but it's well worth the $30 entry fee per vehicle.","April 15, 2018","Generations have appreciated this spectacular natural phenomenon.

There was snow still around which added to the atmosphere of the place.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Bryce Canyon is beautiful. Its different from the other parks in that it has some greenery and isn't as arid. Lots of colorful backdrops. We were able to view the entire park in about 3 hours. At the beginning of the park there is the sunrise area which has a hike that goes down into the canyon. That was really neat but you need to be in a little bit of shape to handle it. Plus if its been rainy or snowy - it definitely is muddy at the bottom.,"April 9, 2018",WOW,12,Urbandale,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We went one a one day trip to Bryce Canyon and it really was magnificent. We drove all the way to the southern end of the park and stopped at every view point on the way back. It was fantastic at every turn. We went down to the natural bridge even though the trip up and down was a bit sketchy with patches of ice one the trail. The winds were blowing making it a very cld experience, but totally worth it. The formations are spectacular and we have not seen anything like this elsewhere.","April 8, 2018",Magnificent views,52,"Frederiksberg, Denmark",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"The scale is grand and the color of Red Rock formation was amazing against blue skies.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We took some friends to visit Bryce on 4/4/18. The views were great, it was only slightly crowded and most of the snow was melted. The shuttle buses were not running so parking was tight at a few spots. I'd recommend the Fairyland loop trail (8 mi. TH to TH and a moderate to hard hike). The views are spectacular and it isn't too crowded. Be aware that you are at 7000 to 9800 ft elevation which makes normal activities (walking, hiking) harder and the UV rays stronger.","April 7, 2018","Beautiful views, much less crowded than Zion",258,"Hurricane, Utah",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,After coming from Zion we were surprised that Bryce was less crowded especially during Spring Break. We parked at Sunrise Point fairly early in the morning and had the trails below the rim almost to ourselves which was awesome. Even mid afternoon it wasn’t overwhelmingly crowded like Zion. In Spring it’s pretty cold overnight so bring warm clothes until the sun reaches the bottom of the canyon. Great place to star gaze at night. There are no street lights at night so you don’t even need to leave a parking lot to see a ton of stars. ,"April 5, 2018",Awesome experience,25,,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Trip advisory boards were very helpful as far as tips for seeing this amazing canyon. No where near as crowded as Zion. Hiking sunset point to sunrise was exactly our speed. Pretty steep downhill hike beginning at sunset. Definitely not as bad coming up on the sunrise side. Sunset, Navajo onto sunrise. We did not check out queens garden loop ( heard is another beauty) We were wiped out from hiking in Zion the day before. No food choices in Bryce. We went in with “0” expectations for that. Just a warning.","April 5, 2018",Amazing!,7,New Jersey,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We would recommend the Mossy Cave trail, which is out of the park. Much smaller crowd. Easy hike. water in awesome rocks. Great.2nd, the spring break crowd at Bryce is a huge issue. They basically don't think it is economically worth it to staff things 100% until May 1st (start of summer). So you run on a skeleton crew, for a 150% capacity crowd. Yeah. You can see how that ends.Sunsets at Bryce....don't really happen, so stay at the lodge.Sunrise...awesome. Don't miss it.If you do the Navajo - Queen Loop, go counterclock wise. There is a HUGE difference in hike intensity. Counterclockwise = gradual climb. Clockwise has a 1 mile grind up a steep....and I mean steep.....slope.If it is crowded, get up early, go to the trails during breakfast, lunch and dinner. Zig while they zag. They are predictable sheep in a big heard. One thing that did surprise me....they wall wake up late. The real crowd doesn't arrive until about 10 am.Also, there is no shuttle until May 1st. read some other bogus review saying there was a shuttle. There is no shuttle.","April 5, 2018",Great place. A bit crowded,16,,4
Bryce Canyon National Park,"This park was our favorite that we visited during Spring Break...we visited Bryce, Zion, Grand Canyon, and Death Valley. So many beautiful views and places to take breath-taking pictures. Don't forget to check into the Hike the Hoodoos program which will provide you with a beautiful sticker when complete (and the opportunity to purchase a matching pin). The NPS staff was AMAZING at the Visitor's Center and a ""shout out"" goes to Ranger Emily who was super friendly during our visit to the Visitor's Center but who also took the time prior to our visit to send a hand-written note and information about the Hike the Hoodoos program to us.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I joined a two day bus tour to see Zion, Bryce and Antelope Canyon. I highly recommend that you go on this trip on your own so that you can see all the beautiful spots in Bryce. There is never enough time on a bus tour, and we only saw Sunset Canyon. Was very disappointed not to see the Ampitheater and other spots in BC. I recommend spending 1 - 1 1/2 days to see BC, definitely with a minimum of one night stay. Also, going on Sunset Canyon, please keep in mind that the deeper you go into the canyon, the harder it is to come back up. It is an 8,000 foot elevation and the air is thin. It is very easy to meander the downward direction into the canyon, but going back up is a different story. But I'm sure for people who are physically fit, it is a no brainer.

We loved our picture at this spot the Best in all Bryce Canyon...near sunset & a sight I will never forget! A return trip in February 2018 rewarded us with a snow view of the Canyon...Breathtaking! Warning...only Sunrise & Sunset Points were open in Feb. the inspirational Point & beyond was closed at the time we were there due to heavy snow.

It seemed that everyone who arrived at this overlook was silent as well in awe of the scene before them. We were there when there was still snow on the ground and landscape and to us, it just added to the beauty. Bryce is a small park ... only 56 square miles, so it's really easy to navigate. We followed a recommendation to head directly up the main road to the top observation area of Rainbow Point (about 30-35 minutes from the entrance) and then came back down, allowing us to avoid left-hand turns into and out of the lookouts.

The best view points are Natural Arch, Sunrise Point, Sunset Point and Inspiration Point. We were here during a Spring break visit and it was fairly crowded then, so summer visitors will probably experience even bigger crowds and more traffic than we did. The throngs of people can be a little overwhelming and frustrating, so time your visit according to your patience level. Use the shuttles if they are running.

We didn't have a lot of time to spend there (just a stop on our way to an AZ art show), but were able to see nearly every major stop on this enormous orange canyon. To me, it was more impressive than the western part of the Grand Canyon and also Zion (which, because of time constraints and physical limitations, we were not able to hike and fully enjoy). If you can't make the hikes at Zion, and must choose between Zion & Bryce, I'd choose Bryce. Don't get me wrong, Zion is breath-taking and a must-see, but this is quicker with fewer lines, and you can drive to many points of interest, which you can't in Zion.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We have visited over half of the U.S. national parks and monuments and Bryce Canyon is at the top of our list of favorites. The bright coral-colored hoodoos that populate this area of southern Utah are like nowhere else. While the park itself is located in a remote area, once you've arrived at the park the viewpoints, trails and services are easy to access. We visited in mid-September and the weather was perfect. The park was quite busy but we still managed to find some solitude in the southern section (I don't think the commercial tour buses go there). We stayed at the Best Western Grand Hotel (see separate review) at Bryce Canyon City, just outside the park entrance, and spent one full day in the park. We got up early and ate breakfast at the hotel, then drove our personal vehicle into the park at sunrise ($30/car valid 7 days, accepts NPS passes). The scenic drive (Route 63) skirts along the rim of the Bryce Amphitheater for 18 miles and there are about 15 viewpoints or overlooks along the way (see below). Not much is visible from the car so in most places you have to stop and get out, but the walking distances are short. The majority of the viewpoint walkways are paved and suitable for wheelchairs or strollers. We drove all the way to the south end of the scenic drive at Rainbow Point and Yovimpa Point first (about 18 miles one-way), and it was very quiet when we were there - we only saw one other gentleman. We then worked our way back north to Bryce Canyon Lodge, stopping at the sights along the way. There weren't any crowds until we reached Bryce Point and Inspiration Point; these were much busier since the shuttle buses go there. We ate lunch at the lodge (see separate review), visited the gift shop for souvenirs, and then walked on the Rim Trail between Sunrise Point and Sunset Point, and on the Navajo Loop Trail into the hoodoos (that .5 mile section of the Rim Trail is paved and wheelchair-accessible but the 1.3 mile, moderately-difficult Navajo Loop is not). Next we drove to Fairyland Point overlook (just inside the park entrance), then visited Mossy Cave Trail (outside the park entrance on Scenic Highway 12, 1 mile easy round-trip footpath to small waterfall and grotto, not wheelchair-accessible).Some Points of Interest, north to south, on Bryce Canyon Scenic Drive* (* indicates attraction has a separate Tripadvisor page):MM0 Bryce Canyon entrance sign: parking for photosFairyland Point*, turn east .3 mile past park entrance sign on 1 mile spur road to overlook and Fairyland Loop Trail, Rim Trail*MM1 Visitor Center (next to entrance station): maps, information, souvenirs, restroomMM1.2 North Campground: picnic area, general store, showers, laundry, restroom, Rim Trail*MM2 Bryce Canyon Lodge*: restaurant*, information, souvenirs, horseback excursions, paved Rim Trail* to overlooks at Sunrise Point* (Queens Garden Trail) and Sunset Point* MM2.2 Sunset Point* Parking: overlook, picnic area, restroom, Thor's Hammer* formation, Rim Trail*, Navajo Loop Trail*MM2.4 Sunset Campground[Note Inspiration Point, Bryce Point and Paria View are on a 2-mile spur road, turn at MM2.8.

These sites are close together and offer amazing views of the hoodoos in the amphitheater. At Sunset Point there is the opportunity to walk down among the formations, such as Thor's Hammer. These are popular areas, so try to go early in the day if you can because the parking fills up.Between mid-April and the end of October there is a free shuttle that operates between Bryce Canyon City (Ruby's Inn*) and the main points of interest in the north end of the park. The wheelchair-accessible buses run every 15 minutes from 8:00am to 6:00pm or 7:00pm depending on the season. Parking is available at Bryce Canyon City if you want to leave your vehicle and ride the shuttle into the park (you still have to pay entrance fee). The shuttle stops at: Ruby's Inn, Grand Hotel, Ruby's Campground, Bryce Canyon Visitor Center, Sunset Campground, Bryce Point, Inspiration Point, Sunset Point, Bryce Canyon Lodge, and Sunrise Point. Note that the shuttle does not go further south on the scenic drive (Route 63) past the turn-off for Inspiration Point and Bryce Point. However, half-day bus tours that go all the way to Rainbow Point are available twice a day (reservations required); call 435-834-5290 or inquire at the shuttle station or Ruby's Inn in Bryce Canyon City. There is a paved multi-use path that goes from Bryce Canyon City/Ruby's Inn to Inspiration Point (about 5 miles one-way). This path goes past the visitor center, North Campground, Bryce Canyon Lodge, Sunset Point and Sunset Campground. It's possible to park or stay at Bryce Canyon City and ride a bicycle into the park (entrance fee applies). Rentals are available at Ruby's Inn.Lodging and camping is available both inside the park and just outside the park entrance at Bryce Canyon City or at the nearby towns of Tropic and Cannonville. The park is very popular so the accommodations stay booked up; reserve as far in advance as possible. A wide variety of recreational activities and programs are available both in and around Bryce Canyon; inquire at Ruby's Inn and the park visitor center. The elevation at Bryce Canyon varies between 7700 and 9100 feet. Be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness (fatigue, headache, shortness of breath, etc.). Take it easy and drink plenty of fluids. Note that pets must be attended and leashed. They are only permitted on paved trails and surfaces.","March 16, 2018",Fantastic Landscape is Easy to Access,1781,"Tucson, Arizona",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This park is extremely easy to navigate, one road in and out. We went in mid-September thinking that most of the crowds would have died down. We were very wrong. As always, we hit the park shortly after sun-up. We managed to get to the Navajo Loop and complete the trail before it got too busy. On our return back up from the bottom of the canyon we notices many more visitors gathering at the top of the canyon. We continued on along the Rim Trail and were stunned by the amount of people. There were so many that it actually made the loop difficult to navigate, so we hopped back in the car and went to the next overlook. By the time we got back in the car, the parking lot was full. Numerous tourist buses were disembarking passengers and it made it hard to get in and out of parking areas for the remainder of the trip thru the park. Some of the viewing areas are basically peep holes in between stands of trees. We were unable to get to some of the lookouts due to other visitors monopolizing them. We tried to ask politely to be excused as we tried to pass on the paths but due to language barriers (or just rudeness) they declined our request. Keeping this in mind, please remember to get a good look, take your photos and move on so all can see. ","March 6, 2018",One of our favorite parks for viewing,95,,4

There are plenty of hiking trails or you can drive from beautiful view the beautiful view. We were there in early February. It was cold but enjoyable. There was very little snow on the ground but I think there is normally more that time of year. The shuttle bus was not running so we were able to drive our own vehicle into the park.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce earns its place as one of the top 5 National Parks in Utah. Requires at least 1/2 day and best to have a full day. The road is scenic, but it is essential to viewing the world-class scenery by parking at the various overlooks (""Points""), getting out and walking variable distances to the canyon rim, typically 100-300ft distances. Most are doable with canes or modern wheelchairs. Well advised, if able, to take at least a short hike down to develop perspective of the landscape and hoodoos. Even 400-500ft would open a landscape page. At night, be sure to walk or drive away from lights to see the best display of the Milky Way in the 48 states (it's furthest from cities). Foreigners especially who never see the Milky Way Must do this, as so many have never seen this miracle. If short on time, then better to not drive the length of the road south and instead, e.g.: 1) visit Sunset Point, 2) Inspiration Point, 3) hike down from Sunset or another point such as Sunrise. Caution on hikes down: harder on knees, but at least 4x harder on heart/lungs on the return trip up. The elevation is 8-9K, so it is also much cooler than lower elevations such as Zion, so clothing choices have to be considered.","March 4, 2018",Truly one of Utah's Big 5 Parks,70,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

Our adult group enjoyed the hunt and find! Snowshoeing here in the winter is our favorite and especially when there is a full moon. The white against the red back drop is lovely.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"The color, texture and scale of the rock formations here are world renowned with good reason. The hiking among these ice and water-weathered lithic giants. These lithic (rock) giants were formed from Cretaceous period limestone, siltstone, dolomite, and mudstone which are the types of rock comprising the varied shapes the Claron Formation exposed here for hikers to get up close. Several trails take you above, below and among the pastel colored pillars called hoodoos in some places because of their shapes. Flash floods are a concern in the wet season because of the steep sided slot canyons and extensive breadth of these watersheds over which the rain may fall.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We did a one night stay here in early December '17, and Bryce has stayed the distance as having the most memorable views in our Zion-Bryce-Page-Monument Valley-Grand Canyon circuit. It's something I'll never forget. Three reasons we loved it:1. The hoodoos - these columnar, gothic cathedral spire-like rock formations, carved by water and ice, were like nothing I'd ever seen before. The pinky-orange and white landscape looked other-wordly, and the interspersing of these pastel rock spires with conifer trees and a glorious blue sky overhead was unbelievably beautiful and any photographer's dream. While I'm quite pleased with some of my photos, none of them do justice to the sheer 'wow factor' of this canyon. I'll never forget my first view out over the hoodoos from Sunrise Point, a short walk from the car park. By the time we'd walked over to Sunset Point a few minutes away (the better view, for me), I was completely blown away by it. I don't think I'd ever get tired of looking at Bryce canyon. You'd see something new every time. I'm usually cold if it gets to less than 10C. I stood for over 90 minutes in -4C temperatures, cold but mesmerised.2. The sunset/sunrise - Certainly in late early Dec, you want to be prepared to be standing around in the cold. It's a good deal colder than Zion or Page either side of it, and I was glad of the full layers, thick coat, scarf, hat and gloves. I'd really recommend having gloves you can use your phone wearing, as it stops you getting quite so cold taking photos. We saw both a sunrise and a sunset, and the sunset was the winner for me. I'd looked up the time and sunset was at 5.10pm, so we arrived at 4pm and walked over to Sunset Point, to set up a tripod. Actually, some of the best photos we got were with our phones. The important thing was not to assume the colours of the sunset would arrive right on the time sunset was forecasted. A lot of people were looking round as the sun finally disappeared at 5.10pm, and thinking 'is that it?' Some people left. I couldn't see how a sky as clear as that and a sun as bright as that couldn't give as a pretty view, so we dug in and waited. It was probably~20 mins (felt like hours in the cold) after the sun had gone that the sky started to do its thing. Then it moved pretty quickly. The sky first went an amazing pinky-purple, and then a deep orange (see photos). The effect of the light over the hoodoos was breathtaking. We kept looking at each other like we'd wake up at any moment. Well worth the wait. Our hands and feet were frozen as we stomped back to the car to warm up, but it was 100% worth it. The night sky, with lots of stars on the walk back to the car, was fab too. Sunrise was good, also at Sunset Point, and I went down the start of the Navajo trail to take pictures of Thor's Hammer as the sun came up (see photos). It wasn't quite as dramatic as sunset, but still pretty cool as the sun first clipped the top of the hoodoos. I'd expected the 'Thor's Hammer' hoodoo to stand out a mile, but there are so many strange and unlikely shapes in these stone pillars that it wasn't that obvious.3. The trails - The whole Canyon is laid out as a set of viewing points. Sunrise, Sunset, Observation and Bryce Points are pretty close to the carpark. I'd go for Sunrise and Sunset if no other. Sunrise first gives the sheer size of the Canyon. Sunset is soooo pretty. We drove up to all the other points in the car, hopping out for a look. They are variations on a theme, but I'd definitely recommend the Natural Bridge. That is really different, and very cool. We walked Navajo trail from Sunset Point as we were time-limited. It's a bit over 2km and you walk down a big slope and then back up it. The views were very worthwhile. You pass through quite different sections of landscape, from walking down a fabulous path between towering red cliffs, to getting close to the hoodoos. Some bits are wooded, some are all about the rock. The final slog back up was a bit tiring, and all those layers can work against you at that point (we had to stop and de-layer several times as the sun rose), but I loved it and wished we'd had time to walk more in this area. That said, if it's cold or you're not inclined to walk far, you can just drive and look, drive and look. We stayed at Ruby's Best Western (perfectly fine) and that was a short drive away, which was perfect for nipping up to the canyon for an early start, and getting back quickly afterwards to thaw. If you are considering having Bryce on your itinerary, I really can't recommend it enough. It's completely unforgettable. We arrived mid- afternoon (to enjoy the drive from Zion in the day - a fab drive) and did the sunset on our first evening. The next day we got up and did the sunrise at just before 7am and the Navajo Loop walk, which took us to about 11am. We then spent a good 2.5 hours driving up the rest of the trail, to look at the other points including the fab Natural Bridge, leaving the Canyon at about 1.30-2pm for our drive on to Page, arriving early evening. An extra day here, or even half day, would have been brilliant as I wanted to do more walking.","February 6, 2018",Three reasons Bryce Canyon was the most memorable part of our 10 day loop + tips on how long to go for & seeing a sunset,278,"London, United Kingdom",5

I recommend hiking the Navajo Loop Trail. Beautiful hike down amongst the hoodoos. This trail can get muddy and slippery so be prepared, wear proper shoes and hiking pole can be helpful. Great picnicking areas, views, gift shop and museum. Not much lodging outside this park. So if your planning on staying here plan ahead. Very nice hotel just outside park entrance. This park is pretty remote. So get your supplies before hand. If hiking don't forget your water and snacks. ","December 26, 2017",Don't miss the Hoodoos,50,"Morristown, Tennessee",5

We did the queens garden / Navajo trail and I highly recommend it. The elevation change is only about 600 feet but going down into the hoodoos is well worth it. Due to the low number of visitors we stopped at every view point in the park. It was amazing.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"An awesome place for everyone to visit, with great opportunities for hiking and horseback riding, but you can also enjoy the most beautiful views literally from your car if you wish. The Navajo Loop Trail is a short and easy but very interesting trail through a unique landscape; it takes you to one of the most famous rock formations, Thor’s Hammer. I explored the longer Peak-A-Boo Loop on horseback, but that one is also good for hiking if you want to spend an extended time around the hoodoos. It is a 30 min drive from the park entrance to Rainbow Point (which marks the end of the road) with several viewpoints along the way. I took about 2 hours for the round trip which was just enough to briefly stop at all of them and take some pictures. Altogether, I had one afternoon and a full day in the park and I got to hike, ride and take the scenic drive which was like everything I wanted to do.","December 23, 2017",Amazing Scenery,34,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5

Start out early and see the Sunrise from ""anywhere"" along the Rim from Sunrise to Sunset point !! All great viewing areas!!!! After sunrise head back and fill up on a big breakfast and then head out on a full day hike. I recommend heading down Via Sunrise point and do the Navajo loop Trail to Peekaboo loop trail and come back Via Queens garden. It's a looong full day of hiking but it will leave you endless views and pics. We took over 1,000 pics combined as every few steps u simply can't help but to do a 180 look around to enjoy the incredible scenery. Although a long hike you will be stopping to take tons of pics and get plenty of rest. *Midway thru Peekaboo you will encounter some bathrooms* The hike up is definitely harder than down so just pace yourself and if you are doing in hot temps bring plenty of water 1/2 gallon to a gallon for sure a hat, sunblock and consider an umbrella to shade you ( looks funny but works excellent ) Grab a great meal after rest up and go back to see sunset ** always different every night.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Landed at Bryce from Nephi mid morning. Goal today was to spend most of the day in the canyon area and get some good sunset pictures. We were there in mid September. First recommendation definitely use the shuttle. Parking is free at the shuttle station. Thankfully I have a senior pass for entry. Shuttles were running about every 15 minutes at each stop. Traffic and parking inside the park was congested and many times certain overlook site areas were closed to traffic due to overcrowding of cars. Shuttles however, ran everywhere all the time. First stop was the visitor center then on to Bryce Point as there was a storm moving into the area. After a brief visit at the point got back on the shuttle and almost made in back into the Lodge before the hail storm. We waited for the storm to pass and had lunch at the lodge. As clouds persisted we decided to come back in the early morning to visit the view points and to hike a couple of the trails. Rim trail was being worked on so part of the trail was closed. There are a number of trails available to walk, strenuous to easy, that will fit all. Who knew that rock could be so beautiful. The wonder of hoodoos and rock spires. The colors were brilliant and the formations of stone were inspiring. Depending on the time of day and the cloud coverage color of Bryce Canyon seemed to be always changing. Never did get to see a good sunset at Bryce, so sad.","December 8, 2017",Amazing Rock Colors,41,"Springfield, Missouri",5

Although majority of people view it from the rim, the trails going down are majestic. Colors change with time of the day, intense on the sun and subtle in the shade or near sunset. Mix of red-orange-purple-rose-white hoodos, stone castles, creatures, figures, vast valley and high plateaus, deep blue skies, and shimmering greens of ponderosa pines are owe inspiring.

We were staying in Springdale by Zion National Park but we had to make the day trip across here to Bryce. You also get to pass by Red Canyon on the way which looks like a mini version of Bryce. Its only a 2 hour drive each way and you get to drive the amazing Zion-Mt Carmel Highway (Route 9) out of Zion which has some of the best views in the World!Back to Bryce - the place is one giant Amphitheatre that you get to view from above in all its glory when you arrive if you park at the Sunset Point trail head parking lot. We arrived around 10am on a Saturday in November and it was very quiet at this time, there were lots of parking spaces available. The view from Sunset Point, and Sunrise Point after you complete the Queens Garden/Navajo Trail is just like nothing else on Earth. The photos don’t do it justice you have to experience it for yourself. It is also worth a ten minute drive South down the scenic route 63 to Natural Bridge which has its own parking lot at the side of the road.Although the elevation is 8000-8600 feet here you don’t feel any lack of oxygen in the air at all, in the Fall anyway and I doubt you would feel light headed unless you are very sensitive to this.Bryce should really be on your bucket list if it isn’t already!","November 28, 2017",Truly Unique,422,"Sheffield, United Kingdom",5

It's so different from Zion - in Zion you in the bottom of the canyon looking up in amazement and hiking up - at Bryce you are on the plateau above the canyon and can see into the canyon and hike down into the canyon among the hoodoos. The stunning colors, the unusual formations, the hikes - you must do a hike if you are able, all make Bryce a site to behold.

We traveled in early November, which is considered the winter off-season, and it was noticeable. Many of the restaurants and hotels were closed. I prefer the lesser crowds at this time of year anyway. If you have just a few hours, then drive to Bryce Point, at the far end of the park, and stop at all the stops on the way back to the main viewing area between Sunrise and Sunset points. If you have more than a few hours, then take the Navajo Trail hike down into the canyon too. It's magnificent to see the hoodoo formations from up close.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"The day we arrived it was 2pm on a ferociously hot afternoon in early September. The parking lot next to the Visitor Center was crammed, with all spaces full and idling cars waiting to pounce on any space that came free. The Visitor Center itself was packed. It was all just like a shopping mall the day before Christmas. So we just grabbed a map and set off for the General Store to get a cold drink after our 5-hour journey. We discovered that all the parking spaces nearer to the Amphitheater were already taken, so we left the car at the Store and set off for the Queens Garden/Navajo Loop Circuit, which was truly spectacular. But once we had completed it in the afternoon heat, we were done for the day. A friendly ranger told us this was not really the best way to do Bryce Canyon, and gave us some tips for the next day.So what a difference we found the next morning. We’d arrived as suggested at 6am this time to take in the view from Sunrise Point, and saw the Amphitheater in a whole new light, with vivid colors that contrasted with the washed-out mid-afternoon light of the day before. A quick breakfast at the nearby lodge and then straight to the far end of the park at Yovimpa Point, where it was still so early that there was nobody there – but still a bit chilly, so take a jacket. Here we took the Bristlecone Loop, but not too fast, as it’s over 9000 feet. Then we worked our way back along the ridge (despite its name, the park is really a ridge overlooking hoodoos on either side) taking in the sights. By 2pm the crowds were back, and we were ready to leave the madness behind and head to the hotel for a siesta!","November 14, 2017",Go as early in the day as you can,90,"Rockland County, New York",5

Most of the hotels located directly in the National Park were at the time of our trip already fully booked and some of them were at that time quite expensive; i.e. get the hotel reservation for the high season done well in advance. The hotels in Escalante are apparently very special. We have explored the Bryce Canyon NP following the HWY 12 Scenic Byway. The impressions were overwhelming, again and again new formations, new landscapes, changing of colours.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Was here long ago. A lot more crowded now, even in the off season. Can still drive in though, which is nice. The hoodoo formations are so unique and special, each and everyone different and they change color over the course of the day. Just walking a few feet gives you a whole new perspective and view. One could literally take thousands of pictures here and not get bored - very challenging to get a perfect shot. I love sunrise and sunset best when the tips of the hoodoos look like they are glowing. Did a few hikes here too - it's great to see them from below, they are so large and majestic. The color combinations and contrasts here are amazing. It's like a symphony made of rock and limestone. Nature is amazing. Only negative is it can get way too crowded which spoils the experience a little. Go in the off season, or on a weekday, and give yourself at least a full day, preferably two....and go to one of the less crowded lookouts, as they are beautiful too and you might get some solitude too.","November 6, 2017","Unique, Beautiful, Endless Photo Ops",537,Montana Rose,5

Amazing views. The weather was perfect! You may want a jacket for the shaded areas and the uphill part where the wind blows.If it is available, I HIGHLY recommend doing the Bryce at night get together. The park rangers had the telescopes out from 9:00 to 10:30 pm and showed us the different stars and constellations. It was so great!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"The “hoodoos” are so characteristic of this park and for good reason. The views from different points of the park and trails changes with every bend and with every hour of the day and changing sunlight. If you are short on time or don’t want to hike a lot, then choose the queens trail canyon - a moderate 2.3 miles hike which takes you up close to the hoodoos. Carry alight jacket in and after oct as it tends to get cold at the bottom, when all sun is blocks by steep cliffs. The best sunset I think is from the Inspiration point rather than the namesake “ Sunset point” A word of caution - the gift shop at Ruby s Inn, right at the park entrance is exorbitantly priced for Knick knacks and mementoes. Try and buy them in any of the major towns nearby. If driving to Vegas, Kanab downtown has wonderful shops where the same things can be found with much more variety and significantly cheaper.

It seems as if each National or State Park we went to on this tour was better than the last & sometimes I am overwhelmed by the wonders of our natural forces of weather (even though I taught both Biology & Earth Science).

We preferred the private car so we could leave an overlook whenever we were ready. Parking at lookouts can be a challenge so be patient. Every overlook was spectacular and worth the stop. We drove to the end and stopped on our way back which seemed to work in our favor. The altitude is high and can cause some issues for those who are sensitive. It was also cold and windy so be prepared. There are several trails down into the canyon for the adventurous, but not for us. We were more than happy on top.There is a nice information center and the Bryce Canyon Lodge inside the park is beautiful. They have a great gift shop,restrooms and restaurant.

We stayed for two nights in order to catch a sunrise, tour the sightseeing points by car and go down in the canyon. We got the very useful tip to descend via the steep Navajo Trail and take the less steep Queens garden trail up - that way is definitely best.

Parking lot was crowded with tour buses and tourist vehicles. Located near the park's Lodge.This is a federal national park so there is an entry fee per car. Rock formations look like gigantic termites ate into the sandstone formations. It is about 0.8 miles down to bottom. There are NO railings or fencing along the switch back trails. If you slip and fall, it can be a long way down. I only had time to go halfway down. The rim is about a 1/2 mile hike along the edge. There are scheduled ranger talks about the park conducted along the rim. The view is superb. If you have about 4-5 hours then you can easily hike down, along the bottom trails and back up again to the parking lot.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon’s proximity to so many other amazing places (Vegas, Page, Zion) makes it a great and easily reachable destination. We stayed the night in Panguitch and it was an easy drive in. The park is fairly small and we only spent half a day there although I’m sure you could spend a couple of days happily. It’s not as large and doesn’t have quite as much to see as some of the other, more famous, parks such as Zion, Yosemite and Yellowstone where you can easily spend 3-5 days. Regardless, it’s a lovely park that’s easy to get to, get in and park at. As we only had half a day, we did the Navajo loop trail that takes you around the rim briefly and then down into the hoodoos and (most impressively) down Wall St and back out again. The views are incredible and unlike anything I’ve seen before. It can get steep at times and very hot if you do it at midday - bring water. You can either take it clockwise (turn left when you enter) or anti-clockwise (turn right). We went clockwise although it seemed most went the other way. Allow 1-2 hours for the hike. The start of the trail is well signposted from sunset point parking lot, where there are also good toilet facilities. A very enjoyable visit and I would like to return to try some of the other hikes.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Caught the free shuttle from right outside the RV park straight into the National Park, cost was $30 which you have to pay to enter the park even if you drive in.

We then walked to the General store for an ice cream and then walked over to The Visitor Centre to catch the shuttle back to Ruby’s Inn. The easiest walk along the rim is from Bryce Point as it is mainly flat or downhill, you can stop at any point and catch the shuttle which run every 10/15 minutes.

Bryce Canyon National Park,After visiting Bryce twice in the last few months with two different groups I would like to pass along a couple of tips which might be helpful. I experienced Bryce two ways: all day at the park and a half day. If you are limited for time and only doing a half day unless you get there very early I would park your car at the visitor center and then take the shuttle to either Inspiration Point or Sunset Point. You can then walk along the trail at the top of the canyon. This is a paved walkway with many amazing vistas. The main reason for taking the shuttle is that the parking lot at Sunset Point fills up quickly and you don't want to be wasting time looking for a parking space when you could be viewing the canyon. If you have time remaining you could then drive further up into the park to different viewpoints. If limited for time I don't suggest driving any further than the Natural Bridge.If you have all day and are in halfway decent shape you should definitely do the Queen's/Navaho Loop Trail. Going down into the canyon give you a completely different perspective of this beautiful park. I would suggest starting at Sunset Point and ending at Sunrise. That way you go down through the canyon which I believe makes it more dramatic. If you are anywhere near this park make sure you stop even if it is for a short period ot time. You will be stunned and amazed at the beauty.,"October 19, 2017",5 doesn't do it justice,52,anaheim,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon has some of the most amazing rock formations I have ever seen. Unlike the Grand Canyon which is very far to the bottom, visitors can walk through Bryce Canyon without too much difficulty. The area around Bryce Canyon is a combination of ranches and small towns, and it's a pleasant drive from Kanab, Utah. We got there early and it was very cold but there were not too many people there. There were plenty of parking spaces. The sign at the beginning of the park stated that parking was limited and you should take the shuttle bus.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Bryce Canyon can only be described as one of the natural wonders of the world. The largest selection of hoodoos anywhere to be seen. It is strictly not a Canyon as it has only one side however it consists of many canyons or amphitheaters. The colours range from subtle pinks to vermillion and palest creams. It's soaring crags and shapes are highlighted by the Pinion and Ponderosa pines which grow on the Canyon floors. Winding their way through these sandstone edifices are countless trails which are easily accessed by walkers who do so in their hundreds. The blue skies assensuate the towering sandstone pillars giving the whole spectacle a wonderful 3D effect. To add to this natural wonder is the wonderful sense of silence you feel walking through this incredible landscape. Use the free shuttle service which is a hop on hop off bus allowing you to enjoy the rim and all it's wonders. You can do as little or as much as you wish. A trip to be enjoyed by all ages and abilities. Be prepared for the large crowds which flock here all year round especially during the months from spring to late October.,"October 14, 2017",Not to be missed,8,"Dorset, United Kingdom",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"This National Park is busy. Lots of people going to the same places to see the same things. The Number 1 Attraction which is a MUST is the Queens Garden/Navajo Loop Trail. The Rim Trail which is 11 miles long can be taken in sections as desired.Bryce Point is a popular & busy photo shoot.For a more quite, less busy, easy hike, go to the end of the 18 mile park road and take the Bristlecone Loop Trail (1.0 mile). A surprising great short hike was the ""Mossy Cave Trail"" which is on Hwy 12, 5 miles east of the turnoff to the park. The Visitor Center has park personnel to answer questions, a store for postcards, books, etc & flush toilets. The 18 mile Rim Drive has multiple overviews. There is some lodging, campgrounds, a store & restaurant inside the park. There is an excellent paved hiking/bike trail through the park, to Bryce Canyon City and all the way through adjacent Red Canyon.Bryce Canyon City is a couple of miles outside the park.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is an interesting national park. Although there are a number of hiking trails, you can see the ""hoodoo"" rock formations (and a huge natural arch) that are the main attraction by driving through the park to the different scenic overlooks. The park spans 17 miles (there is only one entrance so you have to drive back once you reach the end). This can be done in just a few hours, or you can spend a day or two hiking down into the canyon itself.The hoodoo formations themselves are amazing; massive formations carved by water in an ""amphitheater"" canyon presenting vistas almost as awe-inspiring as the Grand Canyon. This is definitely a park worth visiting that should be seen in person. The entrance fee is a flat $30 per car, which is a bargain for a family, though a little steep as a solo traveler.","October 13, 2017",Amazing rock formations,361,"Arlington, Virginia",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,Bryce Canyon is absolutely beautiful. It deserves a few days to explore but even if you don't have that its worth just making a pit stop for a few hours to do the scenic drive and see the amphitheater.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Bryce National Park is simply exceptional and a unique place in earth. I do not believe there are rock formations similar to these anywhere on earth. This park is very personal as it is easy to be fully submerged into the park and it’s wonders. The Grand Canyon is great but too big to feel personal. Yosemite can get close to Bryce but more crowded and not quite as easy to touch. We stayed at the lodge which was four cabins in one building. All separate entrances. Rooms were excellent for a National Park. The dining room at the lodge was also superb. Staying there is the difference between a great trip and a good one. The views are less than 100 yards from the rooms and are simply spectacular. Google some of the great pictures of this place. Many trails that easily get you to the floor of the canyon and near the rock formations without too much difficulty. Colors are magnificent and accentuated at sunrise and sunset. You really can see most of what you want to see without needing in park transportation. Make sure you see salt and pepper on the way in or out. ,"October 12, 2017",Wow Best National Park we have ever been in,48,"Pittsford, New York",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Took us 4 hours to get there from Vegas, but it was a beautiful drive and well worth the trip. We stayed 3 days, drove around one, got rained out the other and hiked the last. Two days is plenty unless you want to do a lot of hiking and make no mistake the hikes are great. The first day we took the free Rainbow Point Bus Tour which goes from the entrance to the far end of the canyon. The views were amazing plus the driver's extensive geological information. I highly recommend it, especially since it's free. The night stars out there are magnificent. We were going to do their Ranger Guided Astronomy Nights program, but the handout they gave us when we entered said it was 3 hours long starting after sunset. The next day I was talking to a ranger and she said she was in charge of the program. When I mentioned we had declined because of the length she apologized and said it's a misprint. The program starts with a short lecture followed by telescope viewing. The attendees can leave anytime they want, next time. If you're planning on going, take a look at all the other close geological state and national parks nearby. You could easily spend 10 days seeing it all beautiful stuff in this area, especially Zion National Park.","October 11, 2017",Uniquely Beautiful!,38,"Sunnyvale, California",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce isn't as organized as Zion. The parking lots at the turn-outs were almost comical with how confused people were and the lines of cars waiting to get in. Tour buses everywhere so better to drive the road early morning or late afternoon. That said, of course the scenery is spectacular. However, if you are doing a tour of Southwest Utah...I would just do this in a half a day - or less, as much of what you see here, you will see later on Route 24 or at Capitol Reef, the Grand Staircase or Canyonlands. Honestly, you could to two or three stops inside Bryce and be done. If there are no crowds...go ahead and drive the entire distance...but otherwise, I would ditch it and continue on up to Capitol Reef. We regretted staying two nights here.The real find in this area is Kodachrome State Park about 10 miles away- you get an up close look at some amazing rock formations and can drive on some amazing level but unpaved roads through spectacular, uncrowded scenery. If you camp, you absolutely want to go to Kodachrome. The biggest problem with Bryce is the lack of any low key, attractive/interesting lodging. All there are is about four large commercial hotels and their billboard, flashing signs (the place is in the middle of nowhere..so no, we are not going to miss your honking large hotel!). The choices as to where to stay are limited and Ruby's Best Western clearly has the lion's share of the hotel market here. The plus side is that Ruby's has Everything: a massive restaurant, a huge - and nice gift store, a grocery store, a post office and a few other services. Also, we stayed in the ""main lodge"" and the room was large and very clean. The down side is the commercial feel of the place, the mass of people and the kitschy nature of the place. In the evening, being a captive audience, we went ahead and signed up for the Western singing performance across the street. A bit weird but very entertaining! They have a generic buffet and some country western guys sing on stage. You sit a tables with people you don't know which was fun - so many people from other countries~!If you can avoid staying anywhere near Bryce for the night...you will probably be happier!(If you are doing a tour of most of the parks in Southern Utah..it is definitely worth it to get an annual pass for $80 dollars. )","October 11, 2017",Low down on Bryce...,40,"Exeter, NH",3
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon National Park is full of otherworldly beauty. Make sure you get down into the canyons and don't just observe from the overlooks at the top. We wished we had the time to enjoy a meal at the rustic lodge. Make sure you bring plenty of supplies, as there is much less available in the surrounding area than in Zion, for example. If you can conquer your fear of heights, enjoy the mule or horse trail ride amongst the hoodoos.","October 11, 2017",Otherworldly beauty,33,"Greenville, North Carolina",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"I have to say that we found Bryce Canyon one of the most amazing places we have ever been. We booked before we left home to do a 3hr horse ride doing the peekaboo loop which we knew went down into the Canyon but never in our wildest dreams we expected it to be like that, I remember sat on my horse at the back of our group just taking in the scenery and I could not believe we where actually riding amongst all those hoodoos! Having not ridden a horse for many years I was a bit nervous at first especially as they tend to walk right on the edge of a sheer drop most of the time but after a while I relaxed and just let it get on with it, we did have a water stop half way round before carrying on back up to the Bryce Canyon Lodge where we started from. I would recommend this to anyone who likes horse riding, and as there were only about 12 in our group you never felt rushed in anyway, the leader kept stopping after so long so we could all catch up and re group. After the ride we went back to Rubys Inn where we where staying and picked the car up and drove through the National Park starting at Bryce Point and working our way back stopping at the various View Points, I must say some got very busy with cars but we were lucky enough to find a space in each of them and Wow the views where just unbelievable . There is a Shuttle Bus that you can catch that will stop at each place if you didn't wish to take the car. I would recommend anyone to visit Bryce.","October 11, 2017",Amazing,39,"Beverley, United Kingdom",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,I went to Bryce Canyon National Park with limited expectations and found myself engrossed by the other-worldy landscape. What really appealed was the variety of features and the many opportunities for walks of different lengths and difficulties and in different environments. We walked part of a track into the canyon - enough to get a feel of it below the rim - and also the Bristlecone Loop Trail at Rainbow Point. It was certainly worth the extra drive to get there. It is worthwhile to walk between viewpoints and catch a free shuttle back to your car.,"October 10, 2017",Much more interesting than expected ,228,"Coffs Harbour, Australia",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We planned this out in detail but nothing could stop reality from happening. We got there mid-day on September 14, 2017 in a thunder storm with hail on the roads and trails. The snowplow was out, strong wind, and sleet hitting our windshield. Determined to see all we could see because this was our afternoon to see Bryce. Our first stop was to be Inspiration Point, we missed the sign and ended up all the way to Swamp Canyon. I didn't know there was a Swamp Canyon, put our rain coats on and took a look. Cold and shivering we returned to our car and went back to find Inspiration Point. Now we saw why we missed the sign which said Sunset Point and Inspiration Point all in one sign and just one turn-off road for both (our map didn't show it that way). We had no problem parking, only one other car in the lot. We went to all the overlooks we could find over there, no hiking like we planned because the trails were covered with 1/2"" thick hail and little rivers running down them. I dropped my camera I was shivering so hard. Then we went to Sunrise Point, we drove in and could not find where we were suppose to go for the scenic lookout. There are many buildings there with names and we finally pulled into a parking lot with the name ""Sunrise Unit"". I asked a man in the parking lot if this was where we should park for the scenic lookout. He said yes but he didn't recommend going there because we could get hit by lightning. I said it's now or never because we may never get back here. I was very surprised walking to the edge of the canyon and got to the edge of this steep cliff with no handrail in sight. Then we went on to Fairyland Point and I thought it was the best of the bunch. We learned you can get great overviews without hiking at Bryce. We also learned that: plan an extra day somewhere on your trip to account for rain. Then we stopped at the visitor's center but that parking lot was full so we couldn't go in there. I am giving Bryce 4 stars because of poor signs and no handrails in some places.","October 9, 2017","Bryce Canyon National Park different perspective, what we learned",91,"Chaska, Minnesota",4

Bryce Canyon National Park,"After spending a week in Utah and going to several National parks in the area, Bryce was by far the most amazing site. Even if you only have a few hours to spend there, I would definitely recommend going. My group only had about three hours before we had to head to the airport to catch our flight home, but we were able to see the highlights anyway.The Navajo trail will come up as highly recommended whenever you do a search on this park and I can enthusiastically confirm that this absolutely spot on. It is a short, 1.4 mile trail, but it gives you some spectacular views and takes you all the way into the canyon. Even though it is short, the ascent on the way back is rather steep so make sure you have lots of water and take lots of breaks because the elevation can definitely mess with you if you are not used to it. If you have time, you can extend the hike to include the Queen's Garden trail as well, the two combined are extremely popular. Before we set off on the hike, we also took in Inspiration point and, again, this is highly recommended as it gives you a great overview of the entire span of the canyon and you can get some fantastic pictures there.This is a gorgeous park that makes you feel like you are on another planet, I can't wait to come back here again and again.","October 9, 2017",Unbelievable,68,"Richmond, California",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is another great national park in Utah with wonderful scenery. You can take in the views from the lookout points (there are about a dozen of these along the road through the park) although to really appreciate the landscape, do some of the hikes. The rim trails are relatively easy going and allow you to enjoy the wonderful vistas from the cliff tops. If you are able to take the more strenuous trails down into the bottom of the canyon then you will be amazed. Hoodoos, slot canyons, winding paths, fabulous rock formations and great colours. All just beautiful. We really enjoyed the hikes to and around Queen's Garden, Two Bridges, Tower Bridge and Wall Street. If you're feeling more energetic, the Peek-A-Boo loop trail is absolutely great and takes you to some stunning viewpoints (take lots of water with you and be prepared for some steep ascents and descents on this hike).

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Stunningly beautiful vistas,exotic hoodoos at the bottom of the canyons, and red/crimson colors that glow at sunrise and sunset make this national park and incredible experience. Bryce is unlike any other park I've seen. The hoodoos and rock formations are so varied and unique. You can drive through the park's 18 mile road, and stop at the 12 or so well marked overlooks. There are also shuttle buses. Most people drive to the end of the canyon and then stop at the overlooks on the way back as then the overlooks are then on the right hand side.Don't miss Sunrise and Sunset Points, about 1/2 a mile away from each other at the rim of the main canyon near Bryce Canyon Lodge. Walking along the rim trails provides fabulous photo opportunities. One great hike combines two trails: start at Sunset Point, down 580 feet of S-curves to the Navajo Trail (rated moderate) and puts you at the bottom of the canyon with incredible hoodoos! Seeing them from the bottom of the canyon is a whole different experience, not to be missed. This trail connects to the Queens Garden tail (rated easy) so that you come up at the less steep (approx. 370 feet of climbing) Sunrise Point. The two combined are just over 3 miles and doable in 2 hours give or take, ,depending on your hiking level. You'll walk through a couple of stone doorways that make this hike more unique.There are hikes for every level.

We started at Sunset Point, took the Wall Street trail which linked to the Queen's Garden trail, and were back at Sunrise Point about 2-3 hours later.

This place was just as unique as Zion, the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley and the other places we visited and we did not walk the trails into the canyon.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This was park number four, on our five park vacation. Even late September had large crowds at the park. Not so much that it affected our visit. We came in from the east and started at the mossy cave hike. A good warmup. The main park has a 18 mile road driving south from the entrance. I recommend driving to the end to rainbow point. For the view. From the sites and trails near the entrance use the shuttle. It is efficient and the parking is restricted at the trailheads and vista lots. The busses run every 10 to 15 minutes. The views are great and the park is well kept. ","October 5, 2017",Great park!,63,"Holland, Michigan",5

There are more hoodoos here then anywhere else in the world.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We were in Bryce in 2009 and decided to include it in our trip this year. Last time we stayed at the lodge at Ruby's but this time we stayed in Tropic which was much better. We went into Bryce yesterday morning then again this afternoon. Both times we were once again bowled over by the scenery. Yesterday we couldn't get to Sunset Point or Bryce Point as the parking was full and the Rangers were not allowing anyone else in. But we didn't have that problem today and managed to get to all the view points. As with all the other National Parks we have been to; Bryce is extremely well organised and maintained. The visitor Center was very crowded both times we went in, but they have a good selection of things to buy; useful and interesting information and Rangers on hand to offer advice. We didn't use the shuttle but it seemed to be popular. I didn't use the basic toilets, but there are flushing toilets available at various points! Bryce is great in that even with limited mobility you can get to see so much. And for those more able visitors there are a number of trails. I struggle a bit with the altitude as we live at sea level, but I did manage to do some walking. An excellent park, not to be missed!","October 3, 2017",Return visit!,182,"Lakenheath, Suffolk",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"My wife and I had been planning a trip to the five national parks in southern Utah for several years, and finally we made plans to go. First was Zion, with Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef, Canyonlands and then Arches to wind up the trip. Needless to say, the scenery was spectacular, but for us, the best sights were the hudus in the Bryce Amphitheatre. There is nothing short of the chimneys in Turkey that we've seen which compare to the stark elegance and magnificence of the structures and formations we encountered at Bryce Canyon. And even there, the formations at Bryce Canyon have no real comparison.The hikes we took were amazing! My wife, who has breathing problems at higher elevations, took in the hikes as well, and the splendor of the surroundings really energized us both. If I had the opportunity, I'd have gone on every hike available, but the layout of the park allows for easy access to lookouts that afford magnificent views. Of all the parks, I think the lookouts are the best placed for majesty of scenery.My only regret was waiting until my late '60's to go to these parks.

We tried not to miss a stop and so many different rock formations and the terrain was especially different at the higher elevations. These parks all offer comfort stations and if you haven't gone to visit them you are definitely missing out. One thing found in Bryce Canyon that was of interest was the Bristlecone pine tree. This ancient pine tree can be found in Peekaboo Trail, Fairyland Loop and at Rainbow Point. These trees are over 1600 years old. Most views are painted with beautiful rock formations called hoodoos.

You could also take multiple days and do what appear to be some very nice hikes. While we were here it got very cold and we decided not to hike!

I hiked the trail down from Sunrise Point to Queen's Garden, and then back to the top (via a trail that had a short sidetrack to Two Bridges). Boy, coming up from the bottom of the canyon will utilize portions of your lungs that you all but forgot about! It is a difficult hike simply because you are always unslinging your camera to take yet another breathtaking shot.When I finished, I met up with my wife in the lodge, where we had just an excellent lunch. We each had BLT sandwiches (they put guacamole in them!), mine with homemade potato salad and her's with a garden salad, and both with a pickle spear. Carafe's of ice water were on the tables, and refilled often. $10 each - what a buy.We stayed at the nearby Ruby's RV Campground, which was next to Ruby's General Store (Ruby pretty much owns the town from what we could see).

We went to Bryce Point, which had fabulous views, and then looked at the trail from there to Inspiration Point, and decided it was just too scary for us, so we took the shuttle there instead. From there we hiked to Sunset Point, went part-way down to the canyon floor, then returned to the rim to hike to Sunrise Point. From there we went to the Lodge for a very nice lunch. If we had more time we would have stayed longer, but we had to drive our niece to Salt Lake City to catch a flight home.Bryce Canyon is known for fantastic rock formations carved by the wind.

Only the 5 of us were heading out to the parks trough the Virgin River Gorge. The drive was very scenic. First we visited Zion which is a really great park! We made frequent stops for pictures, and had a chance to see some of the animals what are unique to the park. Than our next destination was the breathtaking Bryce Canyon! It is just so beautiful and peaceful! The rock formations are awesome! A must see! Our tour guide, Jeff, was extremely knowledgeable and very friendly. It was a fantastic day! I most definitely recommend their tour, and I'm planning to take another tour with that company in the future.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"There's not much to say about Bryce that hasn't already been said. The park is stunning, however it is a bit more commercialized than some of the other parks (Canyonlands, Arches come to mind). My advice is to get out of the car and do some hiking. The Navajo Loop and Queen's Garden are the most famous for a reason- they are spectacular. I went late afternoon, which was perfect- I enjoyed the drama of the late afternoon sun highlighting the hoodoos and at times had the trails completely to myself. I have a feeling many people try to go early to ""beat the crowds"" but going after 4 I had no problem on the trails (the roadway and overlooks were a bit crowded though). Best advice I can give is to go at night. If your timing is right, there is a night sky program run by the rangers that is supposed to be great. I went and unfortunately couldn't find where the program was occurring, but I decided to give it a go myself. It was spectacular. I've never seen the sky look as it did, and I had an overlook completely to myself.","September 20, 2017",Unique Park- Go at Night!,40,"Hingham, Massachusetts",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,I didn't think anything could come close to beating the Grand Canyon for natural beauty but this place really pushes it and almost equals it. It was stunning and a fabulous example of nature at its best. I think because it doesn't cover such a large area allows you to take in everything much easier. Lots of viewpoints and trail walks allow you to get up close and intimate with the park. Didn't do any of the trails that allow you to descend right into the canyon as my fitness levels wouldn't have allowed it but several of our party who did said it was well worth it. At a price you can always let a mule do the hard work for you as trail rides were on offer.

You've all see the photos and heard all about it, so I will just focus on some tips.Use the free shuttle rather than driving yourself around the park. Then you'll have no hassles with parking, and can enjoy looking at the scenery, listening to the commentary, and taking photos. Buses come frequently, so its no problem getting around the park.Get info at the visitor center. That way, you can plan how to do the most with your time. There are lots of trails, so they can point out the ones that suit your needs and abilities. Also, fill up with water at the refilling station -- on hot days, you will need it.Visit all the observation points. They highlight the key attractions and are close to the shuttle stop points. Easy walking.Walk at least one trail. My favourite is going from Sunrise Point to Sunset Point on the Navaho trail route. It goes right into the hoodoos past the Queen's Garden and Thor's Hammer.

My recommendation is go extremely early. Park opens up at 9am Get there at 7am limited parking at each viewing area you don't want to miss nothing. There are shuttles you can pay extra for to go up if you don't want to drive.,"September 17, 2017",Stunning and Gorgeous,4,"Paso Robles, California",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"A truly wonderful place and a must visit after Zion NP. Each view point will literally take your breath away, each one is different in there own special way. To fully experience this place a hike is essential, any of the trails I'm sure would offer you a close up experience within the canyon that you will never forget. A top tip is to arrive in plenty of time for the sunset and sunrise view points as these are obviously big hot spots for tourists, and it can be difficult to find a parking space, the shuttle would probably be your best option. I would recommend going to the furthest view point at the start of the day and then work you way back to the amphitheatre to finish with the spectacular sunset.","September 17, 2017",Breathtaking view points!,5,"Nantwich, United Kingdom",5

As a elderly couple, we used the free shuttle throughout the park and stooped at each site to view and take pictures. The rock formations are different than the Grand Canyon. Buses are Air Conditioned and drive slowly enough for you to see the sites. The driver is very knowledgeable and points out different aspects of the Canyon.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Visited here as part of a coach tour from U.K. This was the fifth NP of the tour. Just when I thought things couldn't get any more impressive than the others I found the best so far. Even more so than Yellowstone. Rather than just stop at view points and then move onto the next we had sufficient time for two trail walks. One from Sunrise Point to Sunset Point which is relatively easy and short and the other from Bryce Point to Inspiration Point. This was around 2 miles along partly paved tracks and undulated up and down but nothing too strenuous. It can easily be done in an hour or less. The views were stunning from so many points on walk with far reaching views to the horizon and an ever changing array of rock formations in the Canyon. Do make time for at least one trail walk and you won't be disappointed. ,"September 16, 2017",Outstanding views,91,"Lewes, United Kingdom",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is a spectacular national park. Somewhat greener and cooler than Arches or Zion, which we also visited. There is a free shuttle bus that circulates around the park so you don't need a car. There are a number of great hikes that take you down to the bottom of the canyon and back up again, and they are well worth doing. But if you are less adventuresome there is a pretty flat trail that goes all along the rim of the canyon, and you can make that hike/walk as long or short as you like.One fairly short section of it is paved.","September 16, 2017",Quite Lovely.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"While this is an incredibly beautiful place - I was not really prepared for the crowds. Visiting the weekend after labor day - I was surprised by the busloads of visitors crowding the viewpoints.While the scenic drive is a nice ride on a motorcycle - there are no direct views of the canyon from the road. You have to pull into the vista points - or even better go for a hike to really enjoy.The vista points further out on the road (toward Rainbow Point) are less crowded. They provide great long distance views and scenic overviews. But they do not really show the canyon and hoodoos.The vista points closer to the park entrance (sunset, sunrise, inspiration) provide great views of the Canyon and Hoodoos - but beware of the crowds. Even though I was on a motorcycle, parking at these vista points was difficult. In a car I would have been very frustrated. The number of tour buses is hard to believe.Next time, I will probably park at the park entrance and utilize the free shuttle to get access to the trails","September 14, 2017",Amazing - But beware of the Crowds,36,"Morgan Hill, California",5

We also went back for the sunset to watch and that was beautiful, but i recommend getting there early if you want a good spot. We hope to go back again and spend more time hiking.

We had 1 day for Bryce and were amazed by hoodoos - 1) start at inspiration point - has best view of hoodoos, go to the top point and not just the parking lot point 2) Bryce point - you may check this out but can skip it if you are not doing good on time 3) Hiking - navajo trail is a must do! Lots of photo ops. Thor's hammer point is a great spot for a picture!4) sunset and sunrise - hoodoos glow in the sunlight so defined go their for sunrise but if you are not a morning person then check them out during sunset5) stargazing - this park is magical at night. Even on a cloudy day we saw so many stars. Park rangers also put up a presentation at night near visitor centre which one can attend without any prior reservation and is of zero cost. It can get really chilly so recommend to pack a jacket and coffee to enjoy the night sky6) wildlife - lots of deers and chipmunks can be spotted around the park. They are adorable.

Being able to explore this part of the canyon, getting up close to rocks and hoodoos formed over millions of years, was a wonderful experience.One day just wasn't enough.

We did Wall Street/Queens Garden loop and the Peek-a-boo trail (down from Bryce Point and up to Sunset Point). Both were superb.Driving out to Rainbow Point and the Bristlecone Pine trail at 9000 feet is worth it for amazing vistas.Getting up early for sunrise is a memorable experience, seeing it light up from the top down.Staying up to see the night sky is also a memorable experience.","September 12, 2017",Amazing place,55,"Windsor and Maidenhead, United Kingdom",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Funny story - After staying overnight in Escalante, we were back on the road looking forward to our next adventure in our month long road trip. I'd taken more than 500 photos the previous day of Capitol Reef National Park and the Grand Staircase Escalante National Park, and didn't realize we were only thirty miles from the northern edge of Bryce Canyon Park. I made the comment that I wasn't taking any more photos today.We were barely out of Escalante, when the scenery began to change dramatically. Half an hour later I was shouting that we had to pull over in a turnout so I could take pix of the spectacular scenery. We got out of the car and started a little hike. For the next hour, we continually stopped along Hwy 12 for pix and to climb some of the spectacular formations. I never knew what a Hoodoo was until we read about them at the Red Canyon visitor center. Just astonishing natural rock formations. You don't have to pay an entry fee to see the hoodoos and majestic rocky peaks along Hwy 12. The ride is free. At least five (free) hiking/biking trails begin at the Red Canyon visitor center. If you want to turn off on Hwy 63 and enter the main area of the park, admission is free if you own a Senior National Park Pass. Otherwise vehicles are $30, motorcycles are $25, and pedestrians or cyclists are $15.This was our 4th Utah National Park in three days, and I'm pinching myself in disbelief over the stunning beauty of this incredible state.","September 10, 2017","Incredible Hoodoos, Like No Other Park",1006,Florida,5

The rim walk is very nice and easy walk with some great views, and there are Park Ranger presentations at some of the vista points that really adds to the experience as they provide background to the park evolution. There is also a free shuttle running along the rim which is great as it let's you park outside the park and skip the worry about competing for the few parking spots in the park. The hikes are a nice mix of short and long hikes which allow you to experience the park regardless if you have half a day or several days. There were quite large crowds when I visited so a good tip is to start early in the day to beat the crows for the more popular walks.

We then zipped to the end of the 16 mile drive, checked it out, and drive back slowly, stopping at every scenic overlook. Each one was Wow, and different from the one before. Our final stop before lunch at the lodge (excellent BLT sandwiches) was Inspiration Point. They saved the best for last!

Similar to the red rock you see in Sedona, AZ, but the sandstone on these pillars changes with rain and wind. While it was too warm for us to hike, we enjoyed the 17 mile drive. Best to drive to the very end of the canyon first and make your stops as you head back toward the entry because the canyon is only on one side of the road.

But we had heard some really positive comments about Bryce, some people even finding it more beautiful and interesting than GC. I'm not gonna take part on that debate here, but have to say that Bryce really surprised me with it's beauty. And it's easily manageable...I mean for example Zion can be a total disaster if there is too much tourists. But Bryce is much more easier to handle as you can circle from one viewpoint to another with your own car. You can't do that at Zion and the shuttle service is awful there.

Our driver, Jay, was really cool and full of useful information. He pointed out the important points in the park and was engaging when he answered tons of questions. There was a separation of rock from the area of Inspiration point. We were walking along the rim and I was actually able to photograph the slide.

The Hoodoos, the canyons and the natural bridge pictured above are outstanding. If you still use 35mm film, take several rolls, you'll need them. If you shoot with digital make sure you have an empty chip or at least one that can store several hundred pictures. Again you'll need it.The park has a shuttle service that can and will take you to almost every overlook. We drove but if you want to sit back and relax between picture opportunities the shuttle is the way to go. The shuttle is free but you will have to pay the National Park fee to enter.I would suggest you get the National Park pass or the lifetime Senior pass.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This National Park was our first stop in our Summer Vacation in Utah. My wife and I had visited some 20 years ago and it's just as beautiful as we remember.Since this is a well reviewed attraction on TA, here's some logistical items instead:1. If you're here during summer, bring lots of water and snacks. It can get quite warm and the hiking and elevation will drain you pretty quickly.2. Additionally, summer brings afternoon thunderstorms and rain.Nothing terrible but just be aware of the lightning. You don't want to be standing on the rim trail out in the open with lightning coming down around you.3. If you're going to do any of the hikes, such as the Rim Trail, keep in mind the altitude. You'll be up around 8,000 to 9,000 feet. 4. Pictures. Definitely bring a camera. The views here are spectacular and make for some amazing photos. If your camera or mobile device as the ability to do panoramic photos, you can find some awesome spots to get huge sweeping vistas.5. Speaking of photos ... the canyon edges are dangerous and are usually covered with loose rock and dirt. Be careful. It's a long drop to the bottom.6. Parking can be a challenge. It's very limited inside the park Get here early or plan on driving around a lot to find a space.7. Finally, I would strongly recommend that you park where ever you can and then walk. This is one of those places that's best viewed up close and personal. This is definitely one of the National Parks you have to stop and see. if you plan on doing at least four National Parks in the area, get an annual pass. It'll pay for itself at the fourth and it'll save a bit of time as well. They'll give you this little holder for the card that attaches to your rear-view mirror so you can just leave it hanging and then visit any National Park in the area.","September 1, 2017",Awe Inspiring,254,"Costa Mesa, California",5

But it's so beautiful! When we were at the bottom of the canyon, it even began to snow - what a unique experience. I'd love to come back one time.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Nothing to say here that hasn't already been said about Bryce's stunning natural beauty. So just let me add a couple of personal observations and suggestions. (1) Absolutely, if you're physically able, take a hike into the canyon floor. Queen's Garden is the easiest, not all that demanding, but the views from the floor area are spectacular. Adding on the partial Navajo through Wall Street adds to the effort but is so, so worth it. (2) Unless you're a committed backpacker, two days at Bryce is probably plenty. (3) If you're coming to Bryce in the summer from either Zion or Moab, you'll appreciate the heat break; Bryce is around 8000' altitude at the amphitheater, over 9000"" at Rainbow, and considerably cooler than those others. A light jacket for morning hikes is a good idea.","August 30, 2017",Stunning,201,"Edina, Minnesota",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We reached the canyon on 5th june morning and decided to take the queens garden trek , being the most popular and covering the heart of the Park. We trekked downwards from the sunrise point. The following day we also did the Mossy trail , the approach for which is outside the park and is about 5 to 6 kms away from the park entrance.The trek till the bottom was fine and comfortable although temperatures being high, do remember to carry lots of water. The trek up was very difficult and tiring. Came across some squirrels ( known as chipmunks in US) who were aggressive and not afraid of humans. While moving up the canyon we came across very narrow stretches which makes the climb even more difficult. Most of the structures were very awkward looking . At times it looked like a row of people sitting in straight lines.","August 30, 2017",Simply Amazing,87,"New Delhi, India",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,Bryce Canyon is something not to miss. We took the mule/horse ride through the canyon and that was the perfect way to see the canyon.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"So obviously Bryce is amazing and completely worth going to see. So are the rest of our National Parks but Bryce is the second most overcrowded NP I've ever been to (second to Zion). Bryce was the first NP where we have ever felt like you were almost forced into taking a bus throughout it. Yes the bus was convenient but the overlooks were slammed and most of the crowds never even looked at the scenery. They waddled off the bus, turned their backs to the amazing vistas and took selfies making sure the background was there. Such a different vibe than Yellowstone, Grand Teton and the like. Anyhow, Bryce is worth going but if there is ANY way you can go some other time than the summer you will have an exponentially more enjoyable experience.","August 29, 2017",5 star scenery - crowds are hard to overcome,36,"Pomaria, South Carolina",4
Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is by far the best national park I have been to. Every lookout point leaves you awe struck. For those that can't or don't hike, you can drive the scenic route, pull over to a look out and be prepared to be amazed. We saw elk, mule deer and even cows on our drive. We also took a horse ride to the bottom of the canyons, which I highly recommend. Just stop by the Canyon Lodge for information. What more can I say, beautiful.","August 29, 2017",Just amazing ,148,,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"The views of the rock formations from the various observation points around the rim are all stunning. While large and extensive, it is still on a comprehensible scale (unlike the Grand Canyon, which is just too big to comprehend). The mutiple formations and the range of colour hues is amazing. Didn't have the time to do it, but a walk or horse ride through the canyon would be a great experience and would also take you away from the crowds that inevitably accumulate at the main viewing locations.","August 29, 2017",Rock formations to take your breath away,31,"Northampton, United Kingdom",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I really enjoyed returning to Bryce... after 40 years. It's really unique, with thousands of colorful hoodoos. Spend more time at the pull-outs/overlooks/etc. nearer the ranger station... like Bryce Point. These are the most picturesque, most spectacular.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"If we had to pick a #1 destination from our 3 week trip out west Bryce Canyon would be it! Incredible does not even begin to describe this place BUT to really enjoy it you have to walk down among the hoodoos and other formations and look up. You won't see the best of it just from the rim. BE PREPARED for some steep climbs though! Heading out of a morning, thankfully with water bottles, snacks and sturdy shoes but sadly no hiking sticks, we had full intention of just stopping at each point via shuttle, going home for lunch and taking the Queen's Garden Trail later in the day. (Hah!) SO with that in mind we got on the FREE shuttle outside our campground (Ruby's Inn) and took it to the farthest point that the shuttle goes - Bryce Point. Wow! What an introduction!Two of our children decided they wanted to hike down the trail. Good idea? Did we fall for it? Oh yes! Always ready for an adventure off we set. Although the night had been cool the day was warming up quite nicely! The trail that the kids wanted to hike was called the Peekaboo Trail but to get to the start of it you have to walk over a mile down and up switchbacks. (Altogether 5 1/2 miles.) As we walked down we were already dreading having to walk back up.Once on the Peekaboo we took the left fork as a bathroom was needed. Yes, thankfully, there is one down there available during the summer months! It was only on our return that we read that a ""Clockwise Direction Required"" was actually written on the official Bryce Canyon paper! (Good job we went the right way! The Wall of Windows is amazing as are many of the different shapes and sizes of hoodoos.At the bottom, at the halfway point of the Peekaboo Trail we stopped for a snack and then made the executive decision we were going to take the adjoining path and get onto the Navajo Loop Trail. There at the bottom was a guide and so we asked him which side was the best to take. He advised us that the left hand side was way more iconic and so off we went. Oh my! What sights we saw and would have missed, including Wall Street, had we not gone this way. It is only 3/4 mile but this one really makes you climb! Thor's Hammer can be seen once you reach the top. If this is your first visit to Bryce Canyon, like it was ours, we would advise you to visit the Visitor's Center first where you can educate yourself on the canyon, watch the movie etc.","August 25, 2017",~~ You have GOT to visit!

Bryce Canyon National Park,Bryce was magnificent! We walked the Navajo Loop/Queens Garden trail. The parking lot in this area was very full so try and get there early to get a spot. We were happy to see drinking fountains with water bottle faucets and you should fill up water while here as there is none available on the hike. Our first glimpse of the ampitheater left us amazed at the natural beauty of the park. The Navajo Loop was very steep but at the bottom it leveled off. The Queens Garden trail was just as scenic.

Parking is tight but there is always someone pulling out, so just be patient. For day trippers, you can easily spend anywhere from 1-3 hours just soaking in the beauty and walking along the rim. For the more adventurous there are many hikes into and around the amphitheater. If you're lucky you may spot some elk and other wildlife. It is a long day from Vegas but if you combine it with Zion Canyon you can have an amazing experience in a day trip. ","August 25, 2017",Awe inspiring beauty,148,New Jersey,5

Do not miss Wall Street and the Queen's Garden trails. Also, seeing the sunrise and sunset are real treats. Go to Bryce Point for sunset. Bryce is one of the only places in the US considered a dark sky location without light pollution. You have to stay and see the Milky Way when it gets dark.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Okay. Everybody has heard of Bryce Canyon. And that is part of the problem. There were tourists everywhere and I mean everywhere. Even though we got there at like 6:30 in the morning nearly all the parking spots were already taken. Another thing that's important to know if you are going to go, you need to go at sunset. At Sunrise, the sun is in the canyon and so you can't really take pictures. Even though they have a ""sunrise view,"" that means you can look at the Sunrise, not take pictures AT sunrise. There is no way to take pictures without the sun being in your camera unless you go towards Sunset. It was our mistake, we did not know that. We probably would have been better off going the day before, way later in the day. But There were so many people it was not that enjoyable. Selfie sticks, screaming kids, etc There weren't as many animals, no wildflowers, and the like. Cedar Breaks was such a delight and so if you want Canyon views but also want wildflowers, to have a place pretty much to yourself, have deer Antelope Chipmunks ground squirrels and the like, I honestly would say go to Cedar Breaks and Skip Bryce.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"A must see National Park. Busier than the Grand Canyon North Rim, but not over crowded in mid to late August. Not many easy hikes other than the rim walks that give you amazing views for over 30 miles. It was fun to sit in the sun and be cooled by the cool wind blowing out of the canyon. The Navajo Loop was our hike of choice as it allows you to hike in and around the hoodoos, through a few small archways, under 1.5 miles and we had some tires little legs with us. Though many do this hike it is not an easy hike lots of elevation change walking next to drop offs and hiking in loose footing. Bryce Canyon Point Natural Bridge and Rainbow Point are all worth the drive to see. The day we went the rangers had a telescope for us to look at the sun through... we were skeptical to say the least. They had a filter that allowed you to do this without burning your eyes out. Unique opportunity to see the sun, it appeared red and you could see sun flares. Nice visitor center at the entrance of the park to get your National Park Passport stamped and learn a few facts about Bryce.

You will definitely regret it when you run out of juice. 3. Hat or Umbrella - It drizzles when we went there.4. Walking stick - it would help because there are some not so steep areas but definitely will help you balance5. Bring snacks - we had ""spamusubi"" and energy bars. What to wear:Walking shoes, light and comfortable clothing. Remember to put on a lot of sunscreen.Best time to take photos - Sunrise and sunset when the hoodoos are orange red in color.Note: ****Please be careful not to bump someone's TRIPOD :) ****It is best stop by the Visitor's Center first to watch the video on how the Canyon was formed.

We also hiked down a little (without my mother-in-law) down the Queens Garden Trail. Kids were tired and hot, so we turned around about 75% of the way down.

When we pulled up to the Ranger station to enter the park, my father asked if there were any discounts (such as as senior discount because our grandma was with us, or a veteran's discount since I served in the U.S. Navy) and the Ranger promptly stated ""Yes, but they are for U.S. Citizens only."" None of us gave any thought to the comment until after my father paid to enter. It wasn't until we drove away, that we realized what she had said. She assumed that a car full of Filipino Americans were not U.S. Citizens based on the color of our skin. My siblings and I were all born in this country, I have SERVED this country, and we love this country for all that it has given us. So much so that we give back as much as we can! This is the first time I have ever decided to leave a negative comment on any place we've visited due to the service we were given. I know that this one Ranger's comment does not reflect the thoughts of the people who work at the National Park, however I just wanted this experience to be shared so that it may resonate with those who have ever wanted to assume someone's nationality before asking any questions. I love our National Parks for their beauty, wonder, and it's reminder that we are all just a small speck in this beautiful world. I will come back again to Bryce Canyon time and time again.

We were limited on time so we opt to take the horseback ride to the bottom of the canyon. It was an exciting and memorable experience and will be remembered for many years. The only complaint we had was being there in July, during Bryce's monsoon season. The clouds rolled in so fast, before we know it, we were drenched by three thunderstorms. It got chilly and we were not prepared for that. Luckily there wasn't lightning. We only spent a few hours here and wished we had more time to explore this beautiful park. Until next time!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"My wife and I first visited and camped at Bryce Canyon in 1989. This was our first trip back and we brought our 17 year old daughter, 21 year old son, and his fiance. We all had a wonderful time. There were a few serious storms and downpours but they only added to the beauty, wonder, and positive experience. The park is big enough and the storms isolated enough that a dry trail was easy to find.I have to give high praise to the park staff. They were fun, well-informed, enthusiastic and helpful. Seriously, we were all so impressed.Like other National Parks suffering from over-crowding there is a shuttle bus system in the park. Our visit was crowded but we were able to find parking spots with little or no wait.We drove out to the very end of the park to Rainbow Point and hiked a short loop trail that offered stunning vistas. Mossy Cave: This is an easy hike with mild elevation gain and NOT in the main park area. Go past the road to the main gate on Rt 12 and down below the canyon. On the right side of the road is a pull out for the trail head and toilets. BE ADVISED: there is no water station here so bring your own.Queens Garden/Navajo Trail/Rim Trail Sunset Point to Sunrise Point: LOVED this hike. RAther than go down the side of Navajo Loop that has Thor's hammer, which you will see at the start of the hike at Sunset Point stay to the right and go down into the canyon through an amazing slot canyon that has some massive pines somehow growing up through the canyon. At the bottom join the Queen's Garden Trail and take that to Sunrise point. The assent is a bit strenuous but just take a break and enjoy the view every now and again. You will enjoy the canyon and the accomplishment.Notable sights: Inspiration Point and Fairyland Point. Also stop in the visitor center and check out the ranger talk schedules.","August 5, 2017",After 28 years still a favorite!,67,"Xenia, Ohio",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We spent about 6 hours hiking at this park. If you are planning to hike this park I would recommend starting at Bryce Point and hiking down towards Sunset Point. That way you don't have to hike uphill. I did the Navajo and Peekaboo Trail which were amazing. Navajo Trail is a must trail here, I would recommend that when going down the trail going left will make it easier to hike back up. The Peekaboo trail I would recommend that you go right where the ""v/trail"" starts and make it to at least the Wall of Windows. Watch out for horse dropping on Peekaboo/and the smell can be bad at times.","August 3, 2017",A Must See Park,3,"West Springfield, Massachusetts",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited Bryce Canyon in July, so it was very hot. The views from the rim are nice, but are exquisite at sunset. You must be on the rim at sunset!! We did go down into the canyon for a 4 mile hike from Sunset Point to Sunrise Point during the daytime. Wall Street was jam packed with tourists. It actually looked like a human ant farm. Once we got past Wall Street though the crowds thinned out. The hike down into the canyon was quite easy and absolutely breath taking. However, what goes down must come up and coming up wasn't a piece of cake. It was REALLY hot and while the incline wasn't bad, it was a hard hike up (especially for my 12 year old son). We all had camelbacks, which is a 'must' in the heat! You can not overestimate how much water you need. Bring more than you think you'll need.We really liked our hike (except for maybe my son) and we loved the views of the canyon at sunset.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Traveling with my wife and two children ages 15 &13 we spent a day and a half in the park and were all thoroughly impressed. The afternoon we arrived we hiked the Rim Trail trail from Bryce point to Sunset. This is an easy hike that allowed excellent views. We took our time and made it a leisurely hike and stopping frequently to enjoy the impressive rock formations. We returned the following day and hiked the Navajo/Queens Garden Trail. I recommend it highly. My two teenagers were awed by the beauty. Hiking amongst the hoodoos versus seeing them from the rim is a must and worth the effort. We each took dozens of photos. The trail is busy but wasn't crowded. Besides we spent so much time taking in the scenery that it never was an issue. What surprised me most was the lack of rangers. My wife and I commented that we thought we would see more. Bryce is such a great National Park. I highly recommend it. Wish we had more time to explore. ,"August 1, 2017",Incredible experience,10,"Palatine, Illinois",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon should be a ""must see"" for everyone. It doesn't matter if you are an avid hiker, a day hiker (like me) or not a hiker at all. We saw people in wheelchairs and with walkers at the canyon rim. We did the Queens Garden/ Navajo Trail hike (liked Wall Street so much that we returned and did the Navajo Trail a second time), the Rim Trail from Bryce point to the lodge, Bristlecone Loop (takes you out to Yovimpa Point which is amazing) and the Mossy Cave Trail. The were all very easy except Queens Garden/Navajo Trail which has some wicked switchbacks. I really loved the area. The views are beautiful and change with the sun/clouds. We did not stay in the park, but rented a charming farmhouse in Tropic.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Absolutely stunning. This is a park that is a feast visually. Easy to drive from overlook to overlook. Most of the path on the rim trail is paved. Lots of parking and facilities (restrooms, picnic tables, water bottle refill stations). We drove up from Zion as a day trip. I would have loved to hike here and we had time. However, you're another 2,000-2,500 feet higher than at Zion and yes - the air is thinner. During our road trip we had snacks in the car that we purchased in Zion - pop chips to be exact. So the bag expanded so much that it was taut and we thought it would indeed burst and pop chips all over the car. So yeah - if you're not used to that altitude, it may take some time to get used it before you embark on a hike across desert at the bottom of a hot hoodoo canyon. That's my only regret - no hiking to the bottom and across, and I hear that it's splendid.Take your refillable water bottle with you and a heavier coat. It was warm in Zion, but windy and cold up in Bryce (altitude change).","July 30, 2017",Aazign in every way - like th vast majority of other reviewers say,232,"Vienna, Virginia",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,An amazing National Park! It's crowded so go early in am or later in day like after 5. Parking can be an issue during peak times. Did not take the shuttle but seems a good way to do the main Amphitheater. The scenic drive is definitely worth it esp to Rainbow point. The highlight for our family was the horseback ride through the canyon. Really a great way to get up close to the hoodoos. The highlight for my 11 and 14 yo. Definitely do the Navajo Loop. The rim hike is a good one too for great views-we did some of it in the evening just before sunset. Beautiful!!,"July 30, 2017",Holy cow!!,4,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5

What goes down, must come up. :0) We are in our middle 70s and have done a lot of beautiful hikes during our 12 years of RVing. This hike definitely looked more challenging (from the top). The well maintained trail, with lots of hairpin turns (helped with the steepness) made it easier than I thought. How does one describe what it is like, walking among slot canyons, arches and a bazillion amazing natural formations. Each one with it's only personality, allowing one to use their imagination. It is impossible to take a bad photo. I would allow at least 3 hours, use good walking shoes, walking stick and stay hydrated. Am having a hard time picking out just a few photos as we took lots. If you have time, I highly recommend doing the hike down. Pick up a map at the Visitor Center and they can tell you the length of the various trails.

Get off the bus Inspiration point and walk all the way to sunrise point. This path is paved for most of the walk. From sunrise point, take the Navajo Trail – at one point it forks, and we opted for we opted for Wall Street because of the amazing views and photo opportunities.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is well worth a visit but to me it is rather limited in it's appeal. Sure the main hoodoo ampitheatre here is unique and rather special, but away from there, the canyon is very nice but nothing to write home about. It lacks the kind of vistas that Canyonlands have (they have great hoodoos too) and it lacks the photogenic grandeur of Zion or Yosemite. We were rather underwhelmed to be honest.The walk down into the canyon to the Queen's garden area is a great experience but it is quirky rather than awe inspiring. I am sure walks away from the main hoodoo area also have much of interest but if you are on a limited time trip there are several other places where more time can be better spent.","July 29, 2017",Disappointing compared with other NPs,217,"Inverness, United Kingdom",4
Bryce Canyon National Park,"What a magnificent canyon to see. It is so beautiful I am glad someone told me to stay an extra day. It was such a long drive, so after checking into the hotel we drove part of the canyon for sunset photos and to scope out the trails for the next morning. We enjoyed all our time there. If you do not want to hike down in the canyon, the rim trails are excellent. I like driving so after hiking, we drove to the far end and made our stops on the way back. This is a place where I will definitely return. They do have shuttles so if that works out best for you go ahead.","July 28, 2017",Awesome Bryce,21,Phoenix,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"This park blows your mind with all those exotic hoodoos! The hikes are excellent and at every turn you see sights that leave you speechless. You just marvel at nature's excellent design sense and creativity. The park has a good shuttle system and if visiting during peak season and peak hours, taking the shuttle is a great option to save you from the hassles of parking. Parking at each trail head and point is easier to find later afternoon or early morning. We did half the Peekaboo trail (2.7 miles) and combined it with the Navajo loop (0.6 miles. the other half was closed) thanks to a ranger's suggestion and it was awesome! We also walked from sunset point to inspiration point which is a great trail with fantastic views.We caught sunset at inspiration point (gorgeous) and stayed past midnight for the stars! Oooooh so pretty! The next morning we drove straight to Rainbow point (the end of the road) thanks to some great tips online and worked our way backwards to all the vista points. We did a 1 mile RT Bristlecone trail loop at Rainbow point and stopped at Black Birch Canyon, Ponderosa Canyon, Agua Canyon, Natural Bridge, Fairview Point, Swamp canyon, Sunrise Point. We then hiked the Queen’s Garden Trail (1.8 mile RT) which was beautiful! On our way out of Bryce, we stopped at the Mossy Cave trail (0.8 mile RT). All in all, this park is something else!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"BC is an easy, scenic 1/2 hour drive from Hatch. We had no delays in entering BC upon arrival around 9 AM. A visit to the Visitor Center is always recommended. Unlike Zion, BC allows for vehicular access to many stops though most ""vistas"" or ""overlooks"" require a bit of an uphill hike to truly appreciate. BC offers many wonders to behold and worth more than the 4 to 5 hours our itinerary allowed.During the season BC offers NPS sponsored talks dealing with many areas of interest to the inquiring mind. We happened by chance upon a talk by a park volunteer delivered with the Canyon as a backdrop. To listen to him explain the geologic process's that formed the landscape we beheld made me wish I had paid closer attention in Geology class. Young kids were in attendance, even they were listening. good Q & A afterward as well. If we do this again I will check the BC website where talks and events are posted so as to better plan the trip.If you want to see wildlife go to another park. There were several huge crows/ravens hanging out near the parking areas waiting for handouts but that was the extent of the critters we saw.Upon our departure from BC we were faced with one of those choices any married couple faces many times along the road to, thus far, 35 years of marital bliss.

Get your butt out of bed and see the daylight come into the amphitheater.. We stayed at the Best Western Ruby's complex, short drive to Inspiration Point, Sunrise point, sunset point, you can't pick a bad spot for sunrise. Do not count on the bus getting you into the park for sunrise, it does not start soon enough. Saw people standing at the bus stops early in the morning and it was going to be a couple hour wait for them. Drive all the way into the park to see the all the lookouts. Don't stop until you get to Rainbow point, 18 miles into the park. Then do all the pullouts on the way back out, so you are not crossing traffic. Now, plan on a day of hikes down into the hoodoos, Navajo and Queens garden are fairly easy and get you down with the hoodoos. Or, do the 3 hour fantastic horseback ride which takes you on a full tour of the canyon. The ride on peek a boo loop was one of the most beautiful rides I have been on. Don't do a ride outside the canyon, book with Canyon Trail rides to take you actually into the main amphitheater. We had Trent as our trail leader and he was terrific. Trust your horse and hang on.

The bus is air conditioned. Our guide was April. She had grown up in the area and is currently a cattle rancher in a nearby ranch. Her local knowledge was fantastic. She added her own stories and personality to make the tour feel more like a field trip! It takes 3.5 hours and you make about 4 or 5 stops.

We found it very easy to drive around the park and stop at all the viewpoints and places of interest. We only spent 1 day driving around the park and this was plenty of time for stops and to walk around all the scenic points. If you plan on doing some hikes allow longer.

It can be cold, it was in June when we went! The colours are just beautiful and they change as the sun comes up. We then walked ""The figure 8"" trail which incorporates the Peak a Boo and Queens Garden trail. We finished by going up Wall Street which is steep but we had parked near the top and a ranger said most people go down so it's nice to go up! On the trails we did you got such a variety of views. The trails are so well maintained. You are going up and down a bit but nothing to steep apart from Wall Street but if your fit and healthy it's all fairy easy, just be mindful your at altitude (8000 feet) and it's amazing how much different this makes to your body! It's just the most unusual, intriguing and beautiful place. I think it takes between 50-20 million years for a Hoodoo to form, that just makes the mind boggle! If you can get down amongst the Hoodoos on one of the trails do, because you get such a different perspective down in the Canyon looking up at The Hoodoos and every turn gives you a different view.

We stopped at the main entrance visitors' center as well as the lodge and gift shop. There were several picnic areas located throughout the park. Using the map helps when touring the national park. It cost more to enter Bryce than other national parks we have been to ($30 vs $20). The scenery is gorgeous and I loved all the photo opportunities afforded us today.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"My husband and I had a great trip to Bryce Canyon National Park a couple of days ago. Not our first trip. The spires and hoodoos of the rock formations are spectacular. Only two places in the world to see formations like this, Bryce and Cedar Breaks. This isn't a canyon as much as it is an eroded cliff face. But you have to go see it. Amazing sight.Inside the park, there is a two-way road to a dead-end at Rainbow Point, with many pullouts from which to view the cliffs. Natural Arch is one of the most popular spots. Sadly, I am now too old for the hiking trails, but there are a lot of them.We also saw mule deer, pronghorn, Utah prairie dogs, Uinta chipmunks, golden-mantled ground squirrels and rock squirrels. The people at the info desk at Ruby's were VERY helpful in finding us just the right places to eat. For example, they told us that the Pines is known for its pies. On this visit, we had a fabulous dinner at Bryce Canyon Lodge, with elk chili, bison stew, spinach salad, and garlic bread with big chunks of garlic in it. If you have small children, the casual Cowboy Buffet at Ruby's Inn might be a better choice for dinner. Also at Ruby's Inn, you can sign up for a helicopter tour of the ""canyon"" the next day, which we did. It is quite pricey but worth every penny. We did not opt for horseback riding, hiking, or visiting the many tourist shops at Ruby's. The park visitor center was small and so-so, but interesting enough for a quick stop. There is an evening rodeo at Ruby's Wed-Sat, but it was cancelled due to thunderstorms and hail (in July!). There was also a dinner theater at Ebenezer's, but we didn't go there either. The nearby tiny town of Tropic has a few interesting old houses and is worth a drive there if you have time and enjoy photography. Mossy Cave is another place to explore if you have extra time.We found that a one-night stay was enough for us for this trip, having been here before, but we could have stayed here two-three nights and not run out of things to do.

We elected to do the nice level trail between Sunrise and Sunset points, as well as the Mossy Cave trail. While we would have liked to go on a full hike down into the canyon itself (the trails looked amazing from the top!), we elected to not do so with our little one due to our tight schedule.

The ranger suggested that we take the shuttle to Bryce Point, then to Inspiration Point and hike along the rim to Sunset Point, begin the Navajo Loop hike and then take our car to view some additional viewpoints. We waited for a few minutes at the visitors center for the shuttle. There was a bit of a line and all seats on the shuttle were occupied. Fortunately, there was still standing room. The shuttle driver was talking about how busy the park was going to be that day. Fortunately, this 1 shuttle ride was the only congestion we encountered. Bryce had a more relaxed feeling than Zion. We followed the ranger's suggestions for the 1st 2 viewpoints and walked along the rim. When we started the Navajo Loop trail, our teenagers quickly told us that they were very uncomfortable (heights/closeness to edge). We decided to hike Wall Street to the tree at the bottom and then hiked back to the top. This was really fun. We continued the day following the remainder of the ranger's suggestions. There is a sit down restaurant in the lodge, but we decided to go to the general store for lunch. They do sell hotdogs, but we decided to get pre-made sandwiches.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Bryce may not be a big as the Grand Canyon . But it has a wow factor for its unusual features . You can pretty much view the whole park and then get down into the canyon and walk through its features . You can't do that with the Grand Canyon . I loved the walks and trails they were great and some of the best of any park . Lots of parks like Arches and Zion could learn allot from Bryce . They spread out the visitors through lots of trails and view points many of which are highly accessible . Also the shuttle bus works really well . It seems more efficient than say Zion .So go and enjoy it is unique .Also a big shout out for the excellent volunteers both here and at other USA National Parks . Great job really helpful .And for any Brits reading this how come these parks are so litter free whilst in the UK folks seem to throw rubbish everywhere . Well done Americans .,"June 30, 2017",My Favourite Park in Utah /Arizona,123,"Berkhamsted, United Kingdom",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"There was a huge forest fire burning 40 miles west sending a huge plume of smoke over the park. Could look at the sun was filtered and was very red adding more of a sunset or sunrise hue to the formations of rock at around mid afternoon. This park is worth spending some more time in also. Hoodoos are unique landforms allegedly only found here but escarpments in Zhangjiajie National Forest Park in Hunan Province and the Rock Forest in Yunnan Province China are similar from photos I've seen just not as brightly colored will find out in mid April when I visit both. Bryce Canyon National Park is impressive and worth going out of the way to see. A tremendous amount of geologic history here. Take advantage of the free shuttle to overlooks it is a hop on and off bus that runs every five minutes or so, saves a hassle in finding parking at viewpoints.","June 29, 2017",Another Site of Unusual Rock Formations and Colors,40,"Olympia, Washington",5

This route lets you to take in all the scenic amphitheaters from above and take in the sweeping views. Trails down into the canyon have more significant elevation changes, but are also worth it to see the hoodoos up close.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This sight is gorgeous, all the hoodoos are must see's for anyone traveling through Utah. We traveled with family from teenagers to grandparents. The shuttle service going through to all of the stops made it so easy to get to all of the locations. The paths to the lookout points are paved perfectly, it was so easy for my grandmother (72yo) to walk up and down on the leveled path & I imagine it is easy to get a wheelchair through if needed. The teenagers and young adults of our group did the 2 mile hike on the Rim Trail, which went from Bryce Canyon Point to Inspiration Point (vice versa). It was great because the older adults just waited and took the next shuttle from Bryce Point to Inspiration Point, & they enjoyed the view until we met up with them. The hike on the Rim Trail took maybe around 30 minutes, which included many stops for pictures and climbing out on the ledges on top of some hoodoos...it is very up-and-down with loose gravel on the paths, so it is definitely not super easy or for people with ankle/knee problems, but it is very doable and gives you an incredible view of Bryce Amphitheater. Unlike Zion National Forest, there is plenty of parking at every main point in this park. At every stop and point that the shuttle stops at there are full parking lots with trail markers and restrooms. Although we used the shuttle (because of our experience at Zion), we saw plenty of parking spots at every stop and it is extremely easy to get in and out so don't be afraid to use your cars (although using the shuttle services definitely alleviates traffic). This is a great stop and a must see for anyone going through Utah!

The weather is completely incredible. 80's during the day and 40/50's at night, We camped at North end tent area which was equally amazing. Here are some tips:1. Spots fill up early between 8-noon. Get there early. You can't reserve the tent only sites, so it's first come first serve. First night I had to stay at Rubys RV park which wasn't fun since they weren't allowing campfires and well it's an RV park outside the National Park. I was able to snag a spot inside the second night and got to have a campfire. 2. Tent spots are close to some great paths to have hikes including one that takes you up where I spotted three condors around 8pm one night. 3. Try to stay three days. You need at least three to explore the hikes. (there are showers)4. Sunset Campground is near the Hoodoo's and also looks really nice as well. Either one is awesome. 5. Inspiration point is great for pictures and an easy hike from Sunset Point6. This National park is quiet compared to Zion. There are a lot less people here I noticed, so this is a hidden gem. 7.

It is especially interesting to compare Bryce Canyon National Park with Zion National Park. Most of the scenery in Zion is from the bottom of canyons looking up.

Collectively, these form an outstanding collection of protected areas with different and unique lands to visit and explore.Bryce is around 1.5 hours drive from Zion National Park to the west and is famous for the presence of thousands of whimsical land formations called hoodoos, which are found in great numbers throughout the national park. A particularly impressive area to visit is the Amphitheatre just below the Bryce Lodge, a few miles within the National Park upon entering from the north along Highway 63. There is a Rim Trail which skirts around the amphitheatre, where you can enjoy outstanding viewpoints including Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration and Bryce Points. Highway 63 also becomes a Scenic Drive running north-south into Bryce Canyon National Park. There are a handful of outstanding viewpoints along the route. Each is on the east side of the road so best to travel to the end at Rainbow and Yavimpa Points and start from there if you are interested in taking in each on your way back north. We particularly enjoyed the scenery at Aqua Canyon and Natural Bridge Points. Obviously, hiking is a popular activity at Bryce Canyon National Park. We particularly enjoyed the Navajo & Queen's Garden combined loop trail, which descends down into the Bryce Amphitheatre at Sunrise and Sunset Points and takes visitors through what seems like a fairy-tale like environment of hoodoos and other interesting land formations. It is an out of this experience with remarkable scenery to enjoy. Within the National Park there are campgrounds as well as the Historic Lodge for guests to stay. Alternatively, you can stay in the townships of Bryce or nearby Tropic, where you can find a handful of accommodation options outside the park. If you are staying for just 1-2 nights, we'd suggest going with the Lodge in order to maximise your time at Bryce. In the end, we adored Bryce Canyon National Park. It is a playfully charming place that made us wish for more days to enjoy hiking around the hoodoos. Even on the shortest of visits, a two night stay seems the minimum amount of time you'd want to allow for Bryce.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"After you leave Zion's 3,000 ft elevation, expect to feel the affects of Bryce's 9,000 ft elevation. It can get cold/cool/windy so a coat is necessary. Bryce for us is #1 of the Mighty Five National Parks for simple reason that it's so unique. You'll feel like you are on top of the world. 1. Stay in Tropic, UT. There are a few affordable lodging and restaurant choices there, it's lower elevation (still 6,000 ft.) and it's only 15 minutes away. The most convenient place to stay is Ruby's Inn at the entrance but that can be pricey or sold-out. The other towns are farther away. 2. Skip the optional park shuttle unless you have tons of time and don't mind boarding and exiting the viewpoints with a few dozen other people. If you go early to the park, you can avoid the viewpoint parking issues and the tour buses/crowds. 3. The crowds are found at the Amphitheater Region, particularly Sunrise and Sunset Point so hit those viewpoints early in the day. Inspiration Point is also nice to see. 4. Hike the hoodoos.The Navajo Loop Trail descends from Sunset Point through the slot canyon of Wall Street. It will take your breath away (literally, remember the elevation). The climb back up to Sunset is steep so take a short walk down and go back EASY. 5. As the crowds build, drive to the last stop Rainbow & Yovimpa Points and take the short, easy walk on the Bristlecone Loop Trail. There are a couple of viewpoints accessible on the right of the road as you return to the exit. 6. Provisioning is simple in the park. There's a general store/snack bar near Sunrise and full restaurant at the Lodge. Plenty of restrooms everywhere but be sure to visit the interesting historic Lodge and their restrooms. 7. After exiting the park just past the pay booth, take the road to Fairyland Point on the right. It's one of the quieter, prettier viewpoints.

The key was starting at the end at Rainbow Point and working your way back. The overlooks are on that return side so no crossing traffic. The Natural Bridge requires no walking and sunset at Inspiration Point is magnificent! Not a ton of parking at these overlooks so off-season may be best to visit like we did in mid- May. The $30 entry is pricey but well worth it. Our hike on Navajo Trail was a lot of fun although a bit on the strenuous side. It's easy to spend a full day here.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon was one of our favorite National Parks to visit on this two week trip! The rock formations are not seen anywhere else and the views from the road out to the end viewpoint are stunning! We drove to the end then backtracked stopping at the viewpoints on the way back as they were all now on our right and it was much easier to pull off and on the road this way. The Natural Bridge was one of our favorite spots to stop and look. Inspiration Point was also a great place to view the canyon below, and it had three different viewing areas that were each higher than the previous one. It started raining while we were here, so it was a faster visit than we had hoped, but still fun. The grade of the path was pretty steep up to the 2nd and 3rd viewing points, so if that is an issue, the first viewing spot is perfect to stay at while others go to the other two outlooks.","June 13, 2017",GREAT Park to visit!,134,"Portland, Oregon",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Definitely a park to be on your list. It is relatively small, and most of the views are accessible and easy to walk, some up and down required.

However the views are spectacular.","June 13, 2017","Nice park, decent (true) hiking",71,"The Woodlands, Texas",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce is a small national park. But the vistas with the hoodoos, rock fins and eroded rock are incredible. The colors make one want to start painting, do pastels, weave or something creative to capture the beauty of nature and the amazing pallet of colors in the sandstone which is revealed on the eastern side of the plateau.

If you are in the area and are undecided about visiting Bryce, you need to go, you will not be disappointed. The colors are different, the shapes are different, and the hikes are different. Pack a lunch, bring your water bottle and make a day of it. There are a lot of restrooms throughout the park as well as places to refill your water bottles.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Nothing, I repeat, nothing will prepare you for the sheer beauty and gorgeousness that is Bryce Canyon. Hoodoos awash in sunlight, rising majestically from the canyon floor and sides, the first sight of the canyon took my breath away. We(a family of 4 with 2 teens) did the Navajo loop starting at Sunset Point. The main stretch was closed, so we went down to Wall Street- it's a series of steep switchbacks to the bottom, but the view is gorgeous. Some people opted to come back up the same way, we went down to Queen's garden and came up to Sunrise point, and walked back on the rim to Sunset point. A few tips: - the earlier you go, the fewer crowds you will encounter. But do go when there is some light to hit the walls of Wall Street. - you will need good shoes, with reasonable tread. The switchbacks have gravel and slipping is very much possible. - if going in the summer, do carry adequate amounts of water. Once you reach the floor of the canyon, there isn't much shade. You can go down from Sunrise point, but the climb back through Wall Street will be steep. We opted to go counter-clockwise (Sunset---> sunrise) and that slow uphill was better for us. We also drove down the main road all the way to the end to Rainbow Point and then stopped on the way back at various outlooks. Do not miss Natural Bridge, Bryce Point and of course Inspiration point. For photography enthusiasts, make sure to get in your sunrise and sunset pics. Wish I had more time to do the Fairytale Loop, or Peekaboo trails. Will definitely be coming back.

There are different stop off points to take photos and some trails at the view points. You can spend a few hours here or even a few days, depending on what type of adventurer you are.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"You have to include Bryce in your schedule! An enchanting scenery everywhere you look over the edge. We drove to the end first, some 25 min, and worked our way backwards. We found the first part near Sunset point and Bryce point the most inspiring. Of the many trails that lead down the canyon, we picked the Peekaboo trail. To really enjoy the beautiful shapes you have to get down to the level where you can walk between the pinnacles! The peekaboo trail is 1.6 km mostly down, 5 km up and down and up and down......... and 1.6 km back up again. Apple health counted over 140 flights of stairs.... But worth every one of them.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Not sure anything can quite prepare you for the view from Bryce Point. It is otherworldly and however exaggerated you may think talk of 'poetry in stone' or 'nature's cathedrals' may be there is absolutely no hyperbole involved...the view is nothing less than breathtaking. Unfortunately perhaps, Bryce Point, is within only a mile or so of the entrance to Bryce Canyon and to go there first, as we did, means running the risk of further anti climax. There are many other superb viewpoints - Inspiration Point, Natural Bridge, and Agua Canyon were amongst our favourites - however the drive between them all is relatively routine and none quite match up to the majesty of Bryce Point.Driving ourselves through Bryce Canyon was the option we took, as opposed to the alternative of a shuttle bus. From what we saw we're pleased to have made the choice we did rather than have progress determined by the slowest passenger on the bus however arrival at Rainbow Point also means climbing to around 10,000 feet so perhaps the bus might be a beneficial alternative for more nervous drivers.Our only criticism of this attraction was the state of the toilets at the Visitor Centre. Probably more of an indictment of some of the very many visitors themselves than the staff, they were absolutely disgraceful but this was the only 'blot' on an otherwise enormously rewarding trip but maybe, if you want to save the best to last, visit Bryce Point on your return to the entrance.","June 11, 2017",Very busy but quite majestic,223,"Ashbourne, United Kingdom",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"While there are so many breathtaking sites in Utah, I have to believe that there is no place on earth that is exactly like Bryce. The view from the amphitheater is something you can sit and stare at for hours studying all the hoodoos and shapes. I suggest an early start. Parking for the best places are full early (9:00 on the day we visited). Try to get a map and not even have to stop at the visitor center. They suggest to drive all the way to the end of the scenic drive and work your way back. However if you do that, you will run into major parking problems. I guess you could get away with that in less busy times of year. If you want to see it all in a reasonable time, park at Sunset Point, walk the amphitheater rim as far back to Sunrise Point as you want to get or have the energy to do. It is a mostly flat and easy walk. Then drive on to Inspiration, Bryce, and Paria Points. These are the best views and fill up first.

Rather than starting at the far end as many do, we worked our way along the view points undertaking short easy hikes. Easy to park everywhere we wanted. Many of the view points are right alongside the road.

It's off the road so it is safe for kids too. The visitor center has a very nice walk through display, several rangers to talk too and a big gift shop. Out of the four National Parks we've been too- Canyonlands, Arches, Capitol Reef and now Bryce Canyon- Bryce Canton seems to be the most pleasant for a camping experience.

You would think that park after park would just be another park, but no no mon ami, one could not be more mistaken. Bryce we magnificent in it's own way - Bryce has Hoodoos! LOTS of them in different shapes and different colors - on hilltops and in canyons, alone and in collections creating a labyrinth of shapes, sizes and colors. So facsinating to look at that you eyes can't land of focus on any one element. And its VAST - again, terms to describe what we saw are just not adequate. Another amazing and gorgeous thing we saw are the Aspen trees. The older and larger aspens apppear to have eyes that look at you as you stroll or drive past them. The Aspens are said to the the oldest living organism in the park. They share one root system which is why you see them in groves. Their trunks are white and have a random pattern of outgrowths (for lack of a better term) that are round and black which look like eyeballs staring at you. when we first noticed it, they were manacing. The later, as we gawked at these groves, mouths open and awe struck by their shear #s and beauty, they appeared to invite us in! :) We were so struck by their beauty that we did a little research to determine if we could sneak one home! But no, not going to happen for a variety of reasons including we don't like at the altitude these trees like. So beautiful. Here's our trick to Bryce, drive the scenic route and take it all the way to the top then do the pull-outs on the way down b/c they are all on the right hand side. And always check in with the visitor's center. They have water, maps and will give great advise on how best to view the park for you. Maybe your knees are not great or you have younger kids - they are able to tell you which trails may be best for you. Also, the maps that are available upon entering or at the visitors center, lest the different trailers, rate them for you in terms of difficulty and also tell you how long the trails are. When we visited the visitor center at Bryce, we saw there would be a ranger talking about the Geology of the park at 11 so we timed our scenic drive and trail walks so that we would make the 11AM discussion. We found it very informative - spoken in clear English so that it's easy for everyone to understand. The was at the ? Lookout and there was some seating for those that wanted to listen in. Something I noticed that you may as well, there are a lot of Asians visiting the park. During the presentation, family and family of Asians came right in next to and behind the presenter to take pictures. The presenter was moving as they were pushing and when their chatter grew louder than the presenters voice, people including myself, started to signal them. I say this b/c I believe it's necessary to educate those that don't undertstand what's going on around them. They were oblivious (and I say 'they' because there were #s of families doing the same thing), that there was a presentation going on. That, or they just didn't recognize that there were interrupting. So several of us extended arms and put of hands up signalling them to stop. We also put our fingers to our lips and 'shushed' them so that the presenter could finish his talk. Sounds like a terrible thing to do but it was necessary and they understood. Again we left Bryce with plenty of light b/c the road to Torrey was said to be even MORE beautiful that the last stretch of Hwy 12. And it's true! Let's just say, Hwy 12 is beautiful. West and East of Bryce.","May 29, 2017",A Must SEE!,12,"Huntersville, North Carolina",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is one of the treasures of our National Park system. It is not a large park like RMNP, Glacier, or Yellowstone, but it does involve a surprising lot of hiking. The view from the top is the treasure, but when you start down on the hike to the canyon floor it is much longer and harder than you expect. You get hotter and hotter as you come down in elevation, often it is cool on top and hot as you get to the bottom. Stay at one of our national treasures, the national park lodges or cabins on top, enjoy the view and hike down and back, it will fill up your day. You never forget your first view of the Hoodoos, the amazing rock formations you see from the top and then hike around.","May 28, 2017",Amazing Hoodoos,112,,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This was the second of the 5 Utah national parks that we visited during a two week trip. Reviews for other parks will be posted. First, to set context; the parks are different and it's hard to compare. It also depends why you are going to the parks. We went to do day hiking (easy to moderate) and photography so this review is based on that. If you are there to just get on and off the shuttle and snap a couple of pictures or to do major hiking, check other reviews.We thought Bryce was beautiful and otherworldly. They say that in Zion you are usually looking up and Bryce you are looking down and that was true for us most of the time. While we were there for three nights, we only hiked for one day because a late May snow storm came through and we decided not to brave it for a hike. While there was no real accumulation, it wasn't pleasant so we wimped out. Whole the snow was unusual at that time of year, it was not unheard of considering the elevation. We saw snow and sleet. I highly suggest to layer up for hiking here because with the elevation change and the time of day you will be adding or shedding layers during the day.For the day we did hike, we combined the sunrise point, sunset point, Queens garden and Navaho trails into a loop for the first hike. Going down Queens garden and up Navaho. Wall Street was closed so couldn't do that. The hike was probably our favorite out of all five parks because it was just so unique. It was also a good hike from a challenge perspective. While it was easy to walk on the path, it's a decent amount of elevation change and the switchbacks up required some breaks to admire the view, take more pictures and catch your breath. We started about 830 in the morning and there were people but not too many. As the morning went on more people were there and the crowd at the top was much larger when we finished.The second hike was in the afternoon going from Bryce point back down towards sunset/sunrise. We chose this because it was downhill but it actually went up and down a lot. This walk was also great but did have a few points where you were closer to the edge and one place where you saw drops on both sides but still plenty of room to walk. Just something to keep in mind if you are freaked out by this. But then again, these parks might not be your best choice if that's the case. The walk was beautiful and provided tons of views of the hoodoos below. I just kept shooting one picture after the other because it was so cool. We stopped at inspiration point for this hike.We then drove up to some of the views higher in the park. The views are pretty amazing and we were even able to see the massive Navaho mountain from far view point.While Bryce does have a shuttle, it is not as frequent as in Bryce and it only goes in one direction at some stops. Keep this in mind if you are planning to use it because we were surprised and had to take it from inspiration for one stop in the wrong direction to get it going the other way to get to our car. This added an extra 20 minutes of wait and ride.Ranger at information center was helpful but not as good as what we experienced elsewhere. This may just be that we got someone on an off day or just got someone not as good. Like any profession, there will be variation between workers. The park does have a number of water filling stations and you should use them to stay hydrated.","May 28, 2017",Beautiful park with otherworldly views and great hikes,17,"Morris County, New Jersey",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce has a more varied landscape than Zion, and it is less crowded. And the vistas rend to be better because you are generally on top of the canyon rim rather than down in a narrow channel. Take the shuttle to Bryce and Inspiration Points, and walk down the rim edge to Sunset and Sunrise Points. A moderately strenuous hike takes you down into the canyon to walk among the hoodoos to get a view of the one that looks like Victoria.","May 28, 2017",A must see,144,"Charlottesville, Virginia",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I've been to twenty or thirty US National Parks, and Bryce Canyon is absolutely in the top 3 of my favorites. The scenery is unlike anything you'll see anywhere else, so that alone makes it worth a visit. A friend responded to photos I sent in this way: ""I knew you were in vacation, but did you go to another planet?!??"" Add in great hiking, spectacular vistas and you have a must-see National Park.When you go, plan on doing at least one hike down into one of the canyon areas, if you can, because the view is completely different and equally impressive from down among he hoodoos. The Navajo Trail down from Sunset point is a popular and good choice, if you only have time for one hike.I alsohighly recommend hitting multiple overlooks, because they're all somewhat different (I've been to all of them). If you only have time for one, I'd go with either Bryce Point or Inspiration Point. Bryce Point is more spectacular, with a 360 view from out at the end of the viewpoint, situated on a long outcropping in the middle of Bryce Amphitheater. Inspiration Point probably had a better representation of hoodoo formations, but since they're so close together, you should hit both, at a minimum!","May 27, 2017",Breathtaking views and great hikes,12,"Cary, North Carolina",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is a nice park! We had only time to visit the Lodge and do the Navajo Loop Trail. This is reported to be the best hike in the park. We parked our camper at the shuttle parking area in Bryce Canyon City and hopped on the shuttle. This is a good idea as parking is limited in the park. We learned a great deal about the city and the park from the shuttle driver. I spoke to a ranger and learned that although either direction on the Navajo Loop Trail has the same amount of rise and fall, the steeper section is uphill if you go clockwise - which makes it preferable for most. Walking through the hoodoos is incredible. It is like you are on another planet. If you are anywhere near this park, it is worth the trouble to do this hike.We then went to the lodge, which is small and quaint by National Park Standards. It has a nice gift shop and a restaurant. We then left the park and ate at the buffet at Ruby's Inn in town. The buffet offered a wide variety of food. The ice cream machine was a hit with everyone.","May 27, 2017",Great National Park!,8,,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce is a great park, especially for ease of access for disabled who use wheelchairs as almost all viewpoints including Bryce and part of inspiration are wheelchair accessible. Bryce is entirely about views. Unlike Zion where you are primarily looking down a Canyon after you hike up to a good overlook or arches which has a mix of close up and overlook views, Bryce just has amazing views off the mesa (not sure if that is right term). Down below the viewpoints you have the Canyon with hoodoos and windows which look amazing in morning or evening light. Probably best picture of my life was taken at Bryce which I almost didn't go too. It was too cloudy for sunrise the next morning. Sunrise is supposed to be even better than sunset, despite a viewpoint called sunset.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"It's a turn around drive through park (about 18 miles) with lots of places to pull off and park to walk to viewing sites and trailheads. The visitor center is busy but go through it first, they also offer ranger led programs and hiking check-ins. There are several lodging areas just outside the park, gas stations, campgrounds where you can camp in a teepee, and several places to get a bite to eat. This parks views are spectacular, if you walk from one end of the viewing area to another it will look totally different. I was dissappointed on how little there was on the Indians that originally inhabited the lands there - just a bit in the visitor center but I think they could do much more. You can enjoy this park without going on any of the hikes but they had several that were considered easy. It's about an hour drive from Zion park and I'm not for sure if you are coming from Arches.

I would definitely recommend spending a day or two here if you have the time and are already in the area.Try to make plans to spend sunset or sunrise here as the sun makes the great scenery even more dramatic. There are lots of great hotels, lodges, cabins, and campgrounds to stay in the area.They also have a convenient shuttle service just like Zion has to reduce the amount of vehicle traffic in the park. 1-2 days to explore at least would be best in my opinion.","May 20, 2017",Stunning views and lesser crowds!,29,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"My dad and I spent a week hiking here and at Zion NP in April. Hiking trails were incredibly well-maintained, though the signage could use some improvement. The weather in April was very pleasant, a bit chillier than expected up top but quite warm on the canyon floor--bring layers! Some of the overlooks near the visitor center can be crowded, but just go out on one of the longer hikes and you'll lose almost all the crows. Note that for a longer visit it might be better to plan a backpacking trip on the Under-the-Rim trail, since we finished most of the day hikes in only 2.5 days. Truly spectacular scenery.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited Bryce Canyon National Park for 2 days during our 10-day Southwest Utah National Parks vacation in April. During those two days we were able to experience a beautiful sunset at the Sunset Point scenic lookout area - we were even fortunate enough to have a full moon that evening! - and stops at all of the major scenic points along the road in and out of the park. For one full day, we hiked Peek-a-boo and Navajo Trails which took us to the bottom of the canyon and into and through the hoodoos - what incredible sights and formations to see! Every time we turned a corner on the trails there was another ""wow"", or ""that is just incredible""! For the Peek-a-boo Trail we started at Bryce Point and had the benefit of viewing the hoodoos the entire way into the canyon. We climbed up from the canyon floor via the Navajo Trail and then returned to Bryce Point via the Rim Trail which had many scenic vistas of the amphitheater of hoodoos, arches and bridges below. What incredible beauty - we would like to return to further explore some trails that we just didn't have time to fit in on this trip.

There were serious crowds, even in April (we were unable to park at Sunset Point, but managed to find a spot at Sunrise). If limited to one day, we did feel that Bryce was ""doable"" in a single day (unlike, say, Zion). We got in three hikes in one day and felt like we saw a satisfactory portion of the park.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We arrived very early to Bryce Canyon. So early that we had a front row center parking spot looking out from Sunset Point at Bryce Canyon. As we are parked there, you can see the top of the canyon, and as you walk down the short dirt path the canyon opens up and my eyes could not believe the beauty of this canyon. The colors and the formations go on forever and it's almost too much to take in and comprehend just how incredible this place is. There are several different trails, but Sunset Point is very central to them all and a great starting/ending point. Going down the Navajo Trail was quite enjoyable. I loved the switchbacks taking us down through soaring mountain walls to the bottom of the canyon. Stopping to look back and up provided some incredible photos. We were feeling adventurous at the bottom and decided to take the long hike along peekaboo trail. This is a long hike and somewhat strenuous (at least it was for us in our late 50's and not in the best of shape). However if you're fit, and/or young, I think you will find this trail very exhilarating. Passing through tunnels was almost like entering a different world as the views and colors changed. So we took Navajo Trail down, then connected to the Peekaboo Trail and did that round trip and took the Queens Garden Trail back to Sunrise Point. Then a short paved walk along the rim back to Sunset Point. We were here on the very last day of April and were glad we did this at this time instead of the heat of summer. I would highly recommend using well ventilating canyoneering shoes with a good wicking hiking sock. My wife had purchased these and I did not. Her feet were very dry and comfortable after an 8 mile hike, while my feet in my sneakers were sweaty and starting to blister. That night we drove over to Bryce Point for the sunset where there is an overlook above the canyon. Being able to look down on the canyon and take pictures of the path we hiked and get an overall view of the canyon was just spectacular.

You can easily see most sites in this park with short, easy walks making its spectacular vistas available to almost anyone.

They were all so spectacular in their own way that I am glad that we didn't decide to skip any even though we had snow and wind! We didn't use the park shuttle as the day we were there parking was not an issue, and we could move at our own pace without waiting around for the bus. We are also glad that we didn't miss the furthest points of the park which the bus only goes to twice a day! There are adequate restroom and water opportunities, and there is even food in the park and just outside of it. It you love hiking, that is available as well.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon National Park is one of a kind. With the exception of the Rim Trail, the trails all have some elevation to them. Also, one of the advantages of going down into the canyon (versus climbing peaks in Zion) is that even if the weather is cold and windy up on the rim, the protection from the wind and the warmer temperatures at the bottom of the canyon are helpful during fall, winter, and spring months. We followed the recommendations of many of the guidebooks and combined three of the most popular trails, creating a 6 mile hike where we were able to see the best of all three trails. The three trails were Navajo, Peek a Boo, and Queens Garden. It was a long day for my 82-year-old mother, but well worth the effort. I encourage the use of hiking pools, given the steepness of the paths. Also, take pictures at the various medallions, and you will receive a Hoo Doo sticker from the visitor center at the end of your hike.

You must see for yourself why this place is so stunning with vistas that will take your breath away. Don't miss the big crows at some of the pull off viewpoints - they ""work"" for treats.. We watched one hop up onto a one of the fence posts when he saw a young boy come to the fence with his camera, and he posed. He stood and posed turning his head in such a way to look regal, his profile against the backdrop of the sky and hoodoos. The boy noticed the crow and pointed it out to his mother and she told him to take a picture (the bird changed poses several times). When the family turned away, the big crow hopped down and followed them to their car where the mother said, oh give him some of your snack! The boy dropped a few nuts next to the car, and the crow had his payment. Moments later another car drove in to the same spot before he was finished and he had to hop out of the way. The people exited with their cameras, and the crow hopped right back up onto the post and struck a pose again! The vistas are stunning; that crow was unforgettable!

I was surprised at the $30 price tag to enter so we just bought an $80 year round Utah National Park Pass. As always the rangers are highly knowledgeable and offer tours. Viewing all the points are easy because they are on the east side, so if you start from one end of the park, you will make right hand turns the entire trip. Stay for sunrise and sunset. The views are spectacular. If you are afraid of heights be careful. Going down near Thors Hammer is steep and going back up is tiring. This is one of the higher elevation parks.

The colors and the formations themselves make them unique and amazing. But throw in the snow in the peaks (we visited in late march), the trees, the vastness and just the collective image that it all makes - simply beautiful. We did the Queens Garden loop with the Navajo trail attached. Walking through is like large castle walls with a garden of trees and brush in between. The hike starts with a downhill slope that seems to go on forever, and a view to match, then the beauty of the forest floor. Of course, what goes down must come up so be prepared for the strenuous hike up , and up, and up some more. Unforgettable.We also stopped to see the Natural Bridge which was pretty impressive as well (even coming from Arches).

Unless you're obsessed with hoodoos, a two hour hike basically covers 90% of this park. I wouldn't reserve more than a half day for Bryce Canyon. Spend your time at Zion!","April 24, 2017",Beautiful scenery but no Zion,237,"Vancouver, Canada",4
Bryce Canyon National Park,"This park is completely unique when it comes to geological formations. The Bryce amphitheater is filled with fins and hoodoos, making it look like fairytale forest of stone. The colors at dawn are stunning - bright yellow, orange, pink and red. There are trails of every level, from the easy rim trail to lengthier hikes down into the canyon. There are several parking areas along the rim, unlike at Zion. Watch out for the altitude though. The rim at Bryce varies between 8,000 and 9,000 feet, so if you're sensitive to high altitude or have health issues, this could be a problem. I live in a very low altitude area, and it took me a couple of days to adjust to the lower oxygen levels.","April 24, 2017",Unique national park,33,"Austin, Texas",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Our family of 3 enjoyed Byrce very much. Different scenery, higher elevation than other parks we visited. Loved seeing the prairie dogs and bristlecone pines. Shuttle/tram was top notch and very easy to access/use. Rim trail was awesome but may be a bit nerve racking for parents with kids <6 - no railings and it's right at the top of the canyon. Snow was still on the ground in places, so that limited our hike options. Great views of the needle formations and canyon. Highly recommend a visit to this beautiful park.","April 23, 2017","Beautiful park, different from Zion and Grand Canyon",7,Midlothian,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,I think bryce canyon national park is the most fascinating in existence....it looks like a mix of a sculpture and painter at his best in nature with a dark blue sky. It is a huge place ideal for hiking the 300-600 feet vertical down AND UP......with numerous trails. The easiest but not easy way to access the canyon floor is to park at sunset and walk down towards the QUEENS GARDEN......more or less an hour down carefully and an hour up slowly with views that leave your jaw open.DONT MISS THIS ONE,"April 23, 2017",BRYCE ENJOYABLE off the charts!,133,"Montreal, Canada",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,This was my favorite park in Utah! The brilliant oranges and pinks were breathtaking. I highly recommend going to see Weeping Rock. This section of the park is still technically within the park but right outside the gates about 10 minutes. There is a river with a lovely waterfall. My kids could have stayed there all day skipping rocks and playing in the riverbed. Not crowded at all. Loved it!!! ,"April 23, 2017",Stunning! ,65,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5

Once we arrived at the park, we knew we had made the right decision to visit this amazing place with breathtaking views. We spent about 4 hours there, and drove to Bryce, Sunset, and Sunrise Point. These viewpoints were enough to appreciate the beauty this park has to offer. Parking was easy to find at every one of these points and there were no crowds the day we visited. The drive from Zion to Bryce was very enjoyable as we appreciated the great scenery along the way.","April 23, 2017",Family Day Trip,5,,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Our family of 2 adults and 2 teens visited BCNP for about 1 1 /2 days. We stayed for 2 nights at the Bryce Canyon Lodge in the park. I would highly recommend that you stay in the park if possible for convenience. Call every day for cancellations- that is how I got my reservation there. Our first day there we arrived about 3:00. We checked into our room and then drove to the end of the canyon road to Rainbow Point and hiked the Bristlecone Loop rail. That was really pretty. Then we watched Sunset from Sunset Point. It was nice (and cold). The next day we did the Navajo Loop Trail (except the Wall Street section was closed). We hooked up to the Queens Garden trail. The whole thing was about 2- 2 1/2 miles. Really great hike. In the afternoon we did the 3 hour horseback ride- incredible views. The next morning we watched the sunrise from Sunrise Point. That was beautiful- a lot more exciting than Sunset. But cold!! We ate all our meals in the Lodge. It was expensive but the food was good. Beautiful views everywhere you looked. We felt that we covered everything we wanted in the time we were there. We did both Bryce, Zion and a few Las Vegas days on this 8 night vacation.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Haven't just visited Canyon lands we weren't sure what Bryce could offer. After entering the park we drove straight the main amphitheater (as we didn't see the turn-off) and ended up at the the end of the road. It was pretty, but not as exciting as the main Bryce Canyon. The best part of Bryce is the opportunity to get amongst the rock walls, you can touch them - without heading off trails, and there's good info on the grades of walks in the info you receive at the entry gate. 2 photos attached. One is the path down (and return in our case) the Navajo trail and the view at the bottom.

Wear the right shoes and have water. I was fine with running shoes but witnessed several falls. There are also paved trails for biking. ATV rentals are popular too.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We loved Bryce Canyon, we arrived at the Park around 1 P.M. after traveling from Coral Pink Sand Dunes. Our room at the Lodge was not ready yet, so we headed off too see the overlook points and get a feel for the park before beginning any hikes. We began with Paria Point, then to Bryce Point, then Inspiration Point, then to Sunset Point. From Sunset point, we walked the rim trail to Sunrise point, about 1 mile round trip, very easy.We spent sunset time at Bryce Point, then walked a trail below the rim a little ways.The next day, it began to snow, but before the snow was really coming down, we drove up to Youmipa Point, then down to Rainbow, then Black Birch overlook which by this time was nearly covered with clouds, visibility not very good for seeing the vistas. From there we went to Ponderosa Canyon and Natural Bridge--Whatever you do at Bryce be sure and see Natural Bridge, it is very close to the parking area and amazing! Beautiful! From Natural Bridge, we drove onto Farview and took the short hike to Piracy Point, by this time it is really snowing and looking like Christmas, very fun! We were dressed for the weather, so we had a good time. After this we got back into the car to head down to Kodachrome Basin, but on the way out of the park, we stopped at Fairyland loop trail and walked about 1 and 1/2 miles round trip, just a short way, but it was really fun. Wish we had had more time on that trail.

The canyon scenery is extremely unique! The hoodoos are so impressive. I've enjoyed other hikes more, but the scenery is so unique that it really makes this place worth visiting.

On the second day, we hiked the Navajo Loop and Garden Trail and it was the most amazing hike I have ever been on. Better than Grand Canyon and the Narrows at Zion.

There was BUS parking available, but I didn't see any big rigs or class A's parked anywhere. Plan on spending a full day here. The Lodge has good food too, moderately priced.

Bryce Canyon National Park,We were at Bryce Canyon on April 2. The Canyon itself is fantastic. The staff at the information centre were uninformative. We felt like they didn't really want to help people plan their day. Every question we asked was answered in a very unenthusiastic response and inaccurate as well. We were told the road to the end was open...not so. It was closed for the first few hours of the morning and then it opened. That meant we had to travel the same part of the road twice in order to see all that we wanted to see. If you plan to hike in the Canyon you will be wise to wear hiking shoes or boots. We were going to hike the Navajo trail but it was very wet and slippery even with hiking shoes. The park did not post any signs indicating that the loop was closed near the bottom so you would have to double back making the hike a lot longer than 1.3 miles. The Queen's Garden loop is just a bit longer and dry. We should have done that one but it was too late by the time we figured that out.

So much can be seen simply by car, but trails along the rim like Sunset to Sunrise, are good as are other recommended walks. We greatly appreciated this wonderful park.","April 3, 2017",Simply fascinating,61,"Battle Ground, Washington",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,Bryce Canyon is one of the most unique National Parks we saw on our trip! The HooDoos and spires are something you have to see in person. We were there near sunset which really made it even more beautiful. We hiked some short hikes then drove to as many of the outlooks we could get to before the sun went down. I think we made it most all of them. Our teens were just as amazed as we were. A definite must see!!,"April 3, 2017",One of a kind!,10,"Tupelo, Mississippi",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We were blessed to visit this magnificent place in Mid March on a sunny, beautiful day a few days after a winter storm. The road and all the viewpoints had just opened. We spent the afternoon driving to the last viewpoint through the forest with a foot of snow throughout, stopping at each viewpoint, some of which involved walking a short distance, ans some right off the road. Each view was wonderful and offered different perspectives which changes as the day grew later and the light softened towards glorious sunset. We looked down on the newly opened Navajo trail and watched people making yjeir way through the hoodoos. Can only imagine that experience,as we did not think we70 yr olds could make it. We had planned to eat at Canyon Pines Restaurant, but found ourselves to captivated to leave so instead snacked our way around the canyon. Wished we had stopped at the subway near the entrance.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Do yourself a favor and go in early spring. We took the fairyland loop and only saw a handful of people. The best views of the canyon are actually down in the canyon so be prepared to climb back out. I also wouldn't recommend teh fairyland loop with kids under 10.

Bryce Canyon National Park,We headed up to visit early in day. Glad we did. We went just past the main two scenic areas as already full and we were able to find a parking spot to visit the next scenic area. Simply amazing views. Walked up the one trail for higher view spot and felt the altitude working against during the steep walk. We then took the car and went along the route for all the upper elevation view points. Well worth the time and since we were early no issues with traffic or finding parking spots. Picnic tables can be found along the ride to stop and eat food you may have packed for the trip. We took our dog along for the walks and car ride. The actual trails do not welcome the dog but we took turns and plenty of area at the view points to visit with the dog.,"March 27, 2017",Stunning views,66,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited in late March and encountered a white-out snowstorm. We waited it out and eventually were able to see the stunning views at the overlooks and pull outs.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This place is special - full stop. Bryce Canyon National Park is a national treasure - no it's a world treasure. It is a must see. It can be viewed by driving privately owned vehicles on pavement to viewing sites or it can be seen by air or by foot. All offer totally acceptable and reasonable ways of experiencing this park. Travel by foot can vary from technical traversing to simple walks but know before you start which adventure you are embarking on. For me, some of the trails are too challenging as I am not a fan of heights and sheer cliffs. A mountain goat, I'm not! But if you are in this neighbourhood stop by I assure you - you will not be disappointed. If you are going to visit by car, I suggest you allocate at least two to three hours for your visit. This will allow you to visit a number of special view points like Bryce Point, Inspiration Point, and The Natural Bridge site.","March 23, 2017",Amazingly beautiful,304,"Edmonton, Canada",5

Beautiful in winter, I am looking forward to visit again in different seasons (summer or full winter).It is not only the peace and tranquility you can feel there, it is the breath-taking mountains, the scenic views and the nice trails you can experience in Bryce (if you are lucky and they are not closed due to snow).After viewing Monument Valley, Mesa Verde and Antelope, I would not expect Bryce to astonish me...and it kept me in awe for all of my time there.","March 19, 2017",A must-see,3,"Dallas, Texas",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited Bryce in early March when there was snow/ice on the ground and closed trails. It was VERY windy the day we visited. This park sits at a higher elevation than it's park neighbor Zion and looks very different! We stopped by the Ranger Station first thing which was the smartest decision we made! The ranger was super helpful and marked on our maps where to go and what to see based on the conditions and our time. His directions were clear and easy to follow. There is one main road with viewing areas well marked so no worries about getting lost. There are a few side roads but nothing that will through you off. I was going to watch the film which reviewers on this site had recommended, but the park ranger told me that it is going to be retired soon and suggested I give it a miss! So we went on our way and completed the route he suggested. If I had to pick one spot to highlight in the park I would say I was most impressed by the ""Amphitheater"" visible from Sunset Point.","March 18, 2017",This park is very different than Arches/Zion!,319,"Frisco, Texas",4

This is a photographers dream with incredible shots available throughout the day but especially during golden hours. If your adventurous, take the trails down into the amphitheater, you'll be glad you did. The only hard part it getting up and out...it's not that bad. Years ago I took a horse back riding tour and it was the best. So worth it.","March 18, 2017",Incredible!,34,,5

Views are specular as far as you can see in the distance. Clear skies offer some amazing views. We stayed in the Lodge this time - next time to Ruby's Inn located just on the outside of the Park's entrance. It was less expensive and more conveniences to offer than the lodge. It was the Lodes off season so not much was opened. It was cold and snowing when we were there 6"" one night and -11 wind chill. Be sure to go all the way to the top and end of the road.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"You know when you look at people's photos something and the colors do not look real and you are sure they have enhanced it? Bryce Canyon is one of those places where every picture looks enhanced. The colors are incredibly dynamic and vivid and cameras cannot truly capture the beauty of this place. Having visited similar areas (Zion, Grand Canyon, Sedona) I have to say Bryce is my favourite. It is small in comparison to other National Parks however the formation of the hoodoos is truly unique to this area. I visited in winter time and it was beautiful to see the hoodoos covered in snow. Downside to this was that sunrise wasn't visible due to a snow storm rolling in and I have read that sunrise when it is truly beautiful however it gives me another reason to go back. You do not need more than two days at Bryce as you can see most of the sights in one day with another day to re-visit anything you truly loved.","March 13, 2017",Breathtaking,19,"Melbourne, Australia",5

Bryce Canyon is an impressive sight, and the hikes look fun (didn't really have time to do any). But, I didn't find it as unique a place to explore as Zion or Arches (Arches is definitely my favorite). On the plus side for Bryce, it was much less crowded, and a nice alpine setting. The park was blanketed in snow (early March), and I enjoyed my stay. The three star rating is in comparison to all National Parks, which are always good.

Our favorite place to stay is Cable Mountain Lodge. So beautiful and just a few minutes walk to entrance to zion and trams. But go off season and avoid the trams and crowds. We loved February.

We went in the dead of winter so there was snow. Some of the roads close in the park when it snows so you may be only able drive to some lookouts (i.e. to Bryce Point). Even the open roads in the park have some snow and are not plowed as much as roads outside of the park. The trails should be ok to navigate in the snow especially if you go later in the day. We had no problems despite heavy snow on the trails. Just be sure to be hiking in the right gear. This includes snow shoes or crampons or heavy duty waterproof hiking boots with trekking poles. The park doesn't have a lot of food options (at least in the winter). There was one pizza shop in the park. Outside the park is just as bad in the winter. There was one, yes one restaurant open. It was at Best Western Ruby's Inn and the food was like college cafeteria food. Nothing special. We only ate there because my father in law was with us. Otherwise, we would have eaten sandwiches in the hotel room. The park wasn't very crowded in the winter. Of course the bulk of tourists are by the lookouts.

Named after it's founder a Mormon Pioneer, Ebenezer Bryce in 1928, this park is worth the trip. We entered the park with our Senior National Park pass and traveled through the 18 mile road in a forest of pines. We passed the lodge where we planned to eat lunch. The canyons are on the east side of the park road (road good) so it is recommended to travel to the end and backtrack. The unique geology horseshoe-shaped amphitheaters carves from the eastern edge of the Paunsaugunt Plateau are formed from erosional force of frost-wedging and dissolving power of rainwater which shaped the colorful limestone rock of the Claron Formation. The shapes include slot canyons, windows, fins and spires called ""Hoodoos"". We stopped at all but one of the convenient parking lots by the different sites. That site had limited parking and the lot was full so the ranger was in the road stopping traffic. Some of the stops were named Inspiration, Paria, Bryce Amphitheater, Rainbow Point. At one point our altitude was high and it was cold so we changed to warmer wear in the convenient bathrooms along the trail. The Amphitheaters were breathtaking! Colors of red, orange, tan and black and Hoodoos everywhere. We could see in the distance a tour group and individuals walking trails. This is where you get wonderful photos worth framing. The Aspen were changing colors and the bright yellow added to the background in the forrest. We saw deer on the side of the road that were used to tourists so a couple were getting great photos.

Whilst incredible, we didn't get to the more spectacular areas of the canyon until late in the day and did not have time to explore as much as we would like.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Was absolutely fabulous. We had a gray snowy day, not much for vistas and long views, but the snow shoeing adventure made it just awesome! Sign up for the free trip in the morning at the visitor center. The ranger met us at 12:30pm at a closed road to Paria point. He distributed snow shoes (free!) to our group of 13 (25 is maximum, they will go out even if only one person signs up!) and we were off cross country to the rim. We stopped at several points to let us catch our breath (it is high country here) and ranger Dan told us more detail about the natural history of the park, its climate, plants animals and geology. Not too much so our 6year old co-visitors did not get bored, yet enough that my 71 yr old mom (in good shape, but not as nimble as the kids with the party) was ready to go again. We walked a bit around the rim oohed and ahhed over the hoodoos and views ( don't miss the ""ice falls"" in the shallow caves about mid way down the hoodoos in making). On the way back we went on the snow covered closed road mildly downhill. The fresh snow only enhanced the over all experience. It was a lot of fun. And if the fact that a 71 yr old grandma was capable of participating puts you off, rest assured you could make the hike more strenuous if you wanted: the ranger gave the more fit younger members of the party plenty of opportunities to make the hike more strenuous by challenging the to race uphill cross country to the rim if they so desired!","February 13, 2017",Snow shoeing with the ranger,62,"Columbus, Ohio",5

You drive along a ridge and there are lookout points along the way.Best way to view it is to do Sunrise lookout first (it is the first one) then go as far up the road as you can and do the lookouts on the way back. You will get the best light this way and the best views over to the ranges in the distance. You do not need to do any walks as all the sites are easily accessible from the car park lookouts.If you can, try and go after it snows.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"My friends and I were deciding which canyon to go from Las Vegas with only a day to spare, whether it will be Bryce Canyon or Grand Canyon. Both of my friends had already been to Grand Canyon and I'd been longing to go there too; I've seen pictures of both canyons and I think the Bryce Canyon looks so much more beautiful than the Grand Canyon so we all agreed to come here in Bryce Canyon. We weren't disappointed and we were so glad we chose this. The sight of the snow and the red rock formations of the canyon is a breathtaking scenery to behold! Pictures don't do justice, you have to see this place and be amazed of its beauty. We had fun playing in the snow too since it was snowing on the day we went here. We didn't get to hike on any trails though since we have to go back to Las Vegas on the same day. I am not the type of person who'd go back to a place I had been to; but, I won't mind coming back to Bryce Canyon, I was mesmerized by its beauty and I hope to be back here someday with my family at a different time of the year so I will see the beauty of Bryce Canyon on another season.

Natural Bridge is just off the road. Definitely stop and see that. The sunset view from Sunset Point is so awesome! It's not hard to understand why people stand and wait to see it. Stop in at Vahalla Pizza for a hot drink and some pretty good pizza. They serve beer and wine too:) We visited over the Thanksgiving weekend and while still a little crowded, there was not near the people you would encounter during the warmer months.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Don't just see Bryce from the Main Amphitheater. You will not appreciate its grandeur that way. Hike down into the canyon. Queen's Garden and Navajo are the most popular trails from what I understand. We opted for the loop, which started at Queen's Way and ended at Navajo, for a total of 3 miles. Very doable, you don't need to be in top physical shape to do it. It was really more of a stroll for me, except for the last part, the ascent from the Navajo point which is very steep. With the presence of snow and ice, I had to take a few breaks there. Amazing views on the way down, at the bottom, and on the way up the canyon. So glad we did this!The scenic drive is scenic, but you mostly see trees. You have to park and walk to the viewpoints. Rather than spend 2-3 hrs driving around and seeing the canyon from different angles, I would suggest to hike down the canyon even for a little bit. You will not regret it!The visitor center is large and there is a souvenir shop there with thousands of items to choose from. There are restrooms there too.We drove to Rainbow Point, which is the highest point in the park, to view the sunset. I took some amazing pictures from up here..Outside the park, in Bryce Canyon City (at least that's what I think the name is), we ate at Ruby's Inn. They had a buffet for $13 per person if i am not mistaken.We then went back into the park and watched the evening sky. I have never, EVER, seen something like that! All the stars are visible with the naked eyd, and so was the Galaxy! We could even see some of the planets! Apparently Bryce is a prime location for star gazing due to the fact that the night sky is so dark. I definitely recommend a visit to this park! Start with a couple of the view points, then hike down the canyon to a point where you feel comfortable, visit the Rainbow point for the sunset, stop at Ruby's Inn for a nice meal, and go back into the park for star gazing!","January 6, 2017",Breathtaking views!,202,Michigan,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Winter offers beautiful landscapes throughout the canyon. Some of the trails may be closed depending on the conditions, and some parts of the trails can be difficult to trek through without traction devices. Though, it is possible to manage without traction devices, if you have poor balance/reflexes, you're better off bringing some along. It will be well worth all the effort, as the canyon is beatiful. The white of the snow set against the orange of the rocks is truly breathtaking.In terms of hiking, they do have some good options, but none are very long. A few hours at most, with some moderate difficulty for the average hiker. The visitors center may be able to provide you with some more challenging hikes.

Do mind, though the ice. For safe climbing down and up, it is recommended to use some snow hiking device.Second day we got to the park early morning, and had very clear visibility from the rim itself, but the canyon itself was covered with clouds. visibility went down to minimum very quickly also on the rim.All in all, an experience not to miss for any cost or reason! worth every minute and sour muscle involved.","December 23, 2016",Breath taking scenery in the snow,2,Israel,5

There was no space to pull over at any point and when we decided we had no choice but to cross off our visit, we could not find a place to turn around and leave. Our visit lasted about three hours with more than 2 and a half hours dead stopped without the opportunity to see anything. Major Bummer. I think our national park system is going to have to move to an entrance reservation system for major attraction parks. Visiting a park like Bryce or Zion is just not fun anymore.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"The views at Bryce Canyon NP were just breathtaking! Much quieter and cooler than Zion NP (due to higher elevation) and absolutely worth visiting. The hoodoo formations are very interesting and the scale of them is incredible. We took the free shuttle bus into the park and stopped at Inspiration, Rainbow, Sunset and Sunrise Points along the way. The total time for viewing the scenic points and using the hop-on/hop-off service took around 2-hours, but we took our time and lots of photos!The day we took the shuttle was the last day of the season for the drivers, but they were as cheerful and helpful as if it was the first day of the season! It's such a nice welcome to the parks when the drivers are knowledgeable and friendly. They do a fantastic job. After viewing the scenic points on the shuttle we returned to our car to travel the one-way scenic drive as there isn't a shuttle out there later in the season. This is definitely worth doing if you have the time. It's quieter and the views are wonderful, especially around sunset.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is not so far from Las Vegas. It's about 5 hours drive. I think it is one of the best canyon park in mid-west America. The national park is very big. There are many scenery spots to go on the map. However, there is one place you must go called sunset point. The view here was different from other places. Also, when sunset, there could be many people. If the number of people was too big, the crew of the park would close the road. So, it's a good choice to get there early. We met the road closure, but fortunately, we got here on time. Sunset there was really beautiful. As I waking down and got into the canyon, I saw some different view. I met a traveler. He said the path going down was a loop trail but it was long. We stayed until moon rose. Also, many people went hiking there. I didn't do that. Maybe, it's also a good place to hike.","November 22, 2016",Wonderful afternoon & evening in Bryce Canyon,4,"Bethlehem, Pennsylvania",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This should be on everyone's bucket list. It's not huge, but there are plenty of hiking trails and lots of pull-outs along the road to stop and have a look. There are paved trails and hard packed trails as well as the more difficult hikes. A lot of the trails are right along the rim, so it's important to watch where you're going and stay on the trail. I wouldn't advise taking small children here unless you can carry them, or attach them to you somehow. We visited in the off-season so it wasn't crowded, but it was cool. It's high elevation so warm clothes are a must. If you have limited time, I would recommend the Sunrise and Sunset trail, and the Natural Bridge.","November 20, 2016",Breathtaking views,46,"Red Deer, Canada",5

I stole this advice, and it was great advice. If however, you want to hike Nahavo and Queens Garden, and you want to avoid the heat, go there first, and then up to the 8000 foot level of Rainbow Point.In summer, arrive early if you want to hike the trails: less busy, less hot. And spectacular. If it's an option, spend two days, maybe three. We stayed in nearby Tropic, only 12-15 minutes away, and close to Grand Escalante Staircase.

Because we were there in Nov., the time between first viewable light and dawn is shorter than in the summer, but that works out better because what one comes to see is the progression of the light. For our hike we headed down Queens Garden from Sunrise Pt. and then hiked up Navajo Loop Trail via the Wall Street section and down the other side to return on Queens Garden to where we started.

The scenery around the park reminded me of Central Oregon, where I have spend many happy times. The trails in the park are easy to navigate, but due to the elevation of the park, descending into the canyons should be well-thought out, for it can be a steep climb out.

The view points are all within short walks of the parking lots, as well as the hiking trails.There is a huge visitors center and the Bryce Canyon Lodge. As far as I know there is only one eating option while you are in the park and that would be at the lodge.Along with Zion, Bryce, and Arches I would highly recommend you visit in late fall, winter, or early spring to avoid the huge crowds.Note - Zion is another park using shuttles. At the time I visited it was required that you use the shuttle, but I would check carefully before you visit, as that could change at any time.

It isn't as big as Grand Canyon, but it more than makes up for that by the fantastic hoodos (sandstone pillars) with varying colours. Sunrise and sunset provide very different perspectives from the day views - it gets very crowded at the sunset and sunrise points, but you can get the effect by just standing on the rim, so don't really need to go to the designated platforms.During the day, we did a short walk from the rim to the base (and back), about 1.5 miles. It was very hot and quite hard going - particularly with the thin air at 8,000 feet. The climbs down and up follow a series of switchbacks to make it easier.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"First things first: we had a fantastic, incredibly scenic, adventurous, fun, hike through varied, often alien terrain.Do your research first! Check the weather, terrain, routes, etc. The lone staffer we met was of little help. (See below.)Like other canyons in this part of the world, the temperature can vary quite a bit. We arrived here after the Grand Canyon, which is hotter inside than on the rim. At Bryce, though, we started off in summery conditions, and - at least on this day in mid-April - needed mid-weight jackets later in the afternoon as the terrain became more shaded and temperate as opposed to the more desert-like conditions at the top.The rock formations here are very unusual. We chose the longest trail and took our time (and a ton of photos), so it took us the entire afternoon and right until sunset to do about 10km. We took many breaks.Take food - it's a workout. Hiking poles are very useful. We are not fit but not totally unfit, either, and found two poles would've been better than one each.There are some very steep sections and if you are really afraid of heights it may be unnerving. Ask people coming off of the trail. And be careful, as it doesn't take much walking off the trail to find some dangerous spots. (So stay on the trail!)It was a challenging hike and interesting because the land changes from tall, dry, sandy rock formations to forest and back again as you reach the top. Some amazing scenery and, while we were dragging ourselves toward the end, it's very rewarding. (Very few places to relieve yourself, however, so do it before you go.)That said, you can see a lot of cool stuff without going on the trail or by taking only part of it at either end. In fact, if you want the quick views, just walk a little down the start, then return and do the same at the end.But here's the other and, sadly, almost equally memorable part of our trip: it took us about an hour to settle into the hike after unbelievably, inexplicably rude ""advice"" from the disgruntled worker.A good person for this position likes people, the park and his/her job. This man possessed none of these, apparently. And while everyone has bad days, don't take it out on the customers.We had done our homework but wanted the kind of specific, detailed advice you can get only from people who are very familiar with the place - namely the people paid to work there.We watched as the couple ahead of us got snarky, almost spiteful comments from him. They, like us, asked pointed questions: what's the temperature likely to be inside the canyon - should we take warmer clothes? What are the trails like?All of these were answered only after needless smartass comments. We found our chosen trail varied in temperature quite a bit. Everyone's responsible for his/her own safety. But failing to advise travellers properly can be dangerous - if you're not prepared for the weather, you could be in serious trouble. (Fortunately for all of us, we were all prepared, no thanks to him.)It isn't fun to answer stupid questions all day, but these people were experienced hikers and polite, as were we.So do your research, because there was nobody else to ask and his answers were not very helpful.This was, thankfully, not at all typical of other national parks staff.","October 27, 2016","Fantastic scenery, great hike, terrible service",4,"Belleville, Canada",4
Bryce Canyon National Park,"The hoodoos in the soft light of sunrise or sunset are magical. They look like sorbet, or creamsicles. There are plenty of hikes to suit all activity levels, and the ranger-led activities like the evening telescope programs are excellent. Don't miss this park - it stands out even in a land of spectacular canyon parks.Hiking the rim is relatively paved and flat, though for those unused to the altitude it can still be strenuous. For those looking for more of a challenge, a number of looping and interconnected trails descend from the rim among the hoodoos, including the Queen's Garden Trail, and the Navajo Trail. Don't miss Thor's Hammer, near sunset point and the entry to the Navajo Trail loop.","October 26, 2016",Breathtaking,94,Florida,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I used to believe nothing could surpass the drama of the Grand Canyon, until I saw Bryce. It's spectacular, it really is. The landscape is colourful, complex and ever-changing. We drove all the way down the Rainbow Point to start with, walked the Bristlecone Loop and up to Yovimpa Point (do not miss this!) then drove back up to Bryce and Sunrise/Sunset pulling over at some of the overlooks. These are the busiest locations with parking restrictions even in October. From Bryce amphitheatre we walked down the Queen Victoria trail then along the bottom and back up the steep side of the Navajo loop, but there are so many trail options; one of the great things about Bryce is that you have many options to descend right into the canyon, or you can stand at the top and marvel. With great lodgings and infrastructure nearby but not actually looming over the canyon (unlike the GC South Rim for example), this is almost the ideal National Park.","October 26, 2016",What a gem.

We usually stay in Cedar City and drive over Cedar Breaks (takes longer) but the scenery is awesome.

I'm sure there must be hiking trails through Bryce and cannot imagine that there wouldn't be, but we weren't seeking them out because both my husband and I had ""overdone"" the day before. The views of the hoodoos were incredible. Unlike Zion, where you are in a canyon and looking up, in Bryce you are up on top and looking down for the most part. One review I had read prior to going, described it like someone had ripped the top off a huge cave and exposed all of the stalagmites. It couldn't have been described better. The colors of the rock change with the movement of the sun and are absolutely breathtaking and the views are so expansive that it's almost spiritual.","October 24, 2016",Bryce Canyon,51,"Franklin, Tennessee",5

We started our day at Sunrise Point to watch the sun come up. We found it was very crowded, which is to be expected given its popularity. Bring a flashlight and get there early to stake out your spot, because it will be packed with photographers and tripods.We took the time to walk down into the canyon a ways, and that was more impressive than Sunrise Point itself. The light constantly changes which means you're seeing things differently minute by minute. The rock formations are fantastic and the natural beauty of this place is remarkable.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Approaching Bryce Canyon you would never guess what unusual land formations are right around the corner! My advice is to drive to the end of the park and walk the short bristle cone trail.then start back and stop at all of the marked lookouts. Each one is beautiful and different. Then decide which hikes you want to take. There are also horseback rides to the bottom of the canyon if you are not a seasoned hiker.,"October 23, 2016",Breathtaking views!,32,,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,It's like being on another planet when you hike through Bryce Canyon. It quite literally made me and my whole party speechless. We took the navajo loops trail and stopped at Queens Garden. The trail is moderately difficult. It is uneven with a lot of ascending/descending (but well worth it). There is a wonderful mix of red rocks and green vegetation at the bottom of the canyon. We stopped so many times just to take in the views. As always with all the trails - layer up with your clothing!,"October 23, 2016",You can't miss this place.,24,"Raleigh, North Carolina, United States",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"This park was our favorite of the Mighty 5. We arrived early and took the shuttle bus to Sunrise Point, from there we took the Queen's Garden trail and picked up the Navajo Loop to Wall Street. As you descend, the size and magnificence of the Hoodoos takes center stage and provides ample opportunity to try out your photographer skills. With the mix of desert and forest, this is an absolute delight. The ascent at Wall Street can be moderately challenging for the cardiovascular system, but well worth the climb. Then take the Rim trail from Sunset point back to Sunrise point and revel in the view below. After our hike, we shuttled back to the Visitor's Center and took a solo drive to the end of the park. We stopped at each viewpoint on the way down and finished off with a final climb at Inspiration point, great way to finish out the park.","October 23, 2016",Best of the Mighty 5,11,,5

Bryce is one of the more crowded National Parks in Utah, so parking at scenic areas can be a challenge sometimes.

We also did the 3 hour free bus tour that is offered that goes out to Rainbow Point. Great tour and the bus/guide lives in the area and knows so much about the park, trying to answer all your questions and give you other pieces of information. You can find the phone number in the Park Newspaper and call the day before for reservations, runs at 9 am and 1 pm.We did some hikes as well, a couple of ranger programs and the night sky was impressive to look at the one night it cleared off.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Started at the top by sunset point. It took 50 minutes to get down to junction to carry on to peekaboo loop. Peekaboo loop took an hour and 45. Then we walked up to sunset point which took 45 minutes. We didn't go to queens garden as its a dead end.There's a few things to note about visiting Bryce Canyon. It's very busy and car parking can be an issue. When we arrived we couldn't find a space by the visitors centre so we had to park in an adjacent car park we did manage to get a space but only because someone left. After the visitors centre we headed up to the car by sunset point. This was very very busy and it's basically constantly full so you have to spot someone leaving and then get their space, it's the only way. In the end it only took us about 20 minutes to find a space.In terms of the actual walk itself the Navajo loop was very busy but the peekaboo busy was a lot less so and we really enjoyed the hike. Both have some fabulous viewpoints; the Navajo loop takes in Wall Street and The Silent City and the peekaboo loop takes in sights including the Cathedral and the Wall of Windows.The ranger at the crossroads of the Navajo and peekaboo trails said that most people take about 2 and a half hours to hike the peekaboo trail but if you're pretty fit you can probably do it in closer to 2 hours like we did. It just depends how many photos you take and many times you stop really. It's also worth noting that there's a restroom at the halfway point in the peekaboo trail.We finished our trip to Bryce by watching sunset at Inspiration Point. A ranger in the information centre told us that this is better than sunset point for sunset. It was a good spot to watch sunset.Finally - an extra thing to note is that there is an 'I hiked the hoodos' thing where if u take photos of yourself next to the various marker points throughout the trails (I took mine on the peekaboo loop) you can go to the visitor centre and claim a reward. This is basically a sticker that says 'I hiked the hoodoos' (see photos). I think it's primarily aimed at kids but it'll fit in my holiday scrapbook nicely.","October 22, 2016",Wow - what an amazing place. Do one of the hikes!,255,"Swansea, United Kingdom",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is quite simply one of the most breathtaking places on the planet and in my opinion possibly even better than Grand Canyon South Rim. Unlike many of the Utah National Parks where you need to hike a fair way to appreciate the true beauty of the park, at Bryce you are able to drive right into the heart of the park with a multitude of lookouts and beautiful vistas to see along the way. It is well worth taking the time to hike down into the canyon itself. My boys (aged 8 and 10) did the Queen's Garden/Najavo loop trail between Sunrise and Sunset points and whilst it was a little strenuous in parts, it is truly the only way to appreciate the majesty of the hoodoos and the sheer power of nature that has created these ecological marvels of the canyon. One piece of advice - when doing the drive, go all the way down to Rainbow Point first as it is easier to stop at the lookouts as you come back along the road and also Rainbow Point is probably the best spot to gain an appreciation of the size of Bryce Canyon","October 22, 2016",Simply Stunning,51,"Brisbane, Australia",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce is definitely a wonder of the West! It has spectacular views of the canyons and hoodoos! There are plenty of hikes and some camping in the park. It is a well maintained park. We went in mid October and the crowds were lower. Seems to peak in the morning till about 3. At 5 pm is is mostly empty and you can drive between the stops and get photos with the sunset which is amazing against the rocks! One of my favorite canyons on the Colorado Plateau. Definately do the Queen/Navajo loop. It is 2.9 miles total and you do climb 600 feet up switchbacks on all gravel/dirt groomed trail. But it is AMAZING to see and definately worth it. IF you go in the summer wear a hat, bring plenty of water and take frequent stops on the climb up. I did it carrying a 3 year old child in about 2 hours though the hike says 2-3 hours. In the fall it does get chilly in the evening. So if you drive up for sunset bring jackets and blankets if you stay for the stars.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"One of the very best vacation spots ever...if you're into some moderate hiking and incredible views of almost 'other worldly' wonders! My girlfriend and I started off with a 5-miler...peek-a-boo loop on the first day with fantastic, late summer/early fall weather. The trail was light with fellow hikers, so it made the autumn trek easy to be 'one' with the nature that enveloped us both. There were interesting and fascinating rock formations that abounded with almost every color known to man...and then some! The trail provided some good exercise too, as we descended/ascended over 1500' over the course of the day. Needless to say, we both were spent and slept easy that night. Given the time constraints, we weren't able to enjoy all the trails that Bryce had to offer, seeing that our visit was to include Capitol Reef and a late, additional side trip to Goblin Valley...a must do for any 'canyon fan'.

The cliff face undulates, creating semi-circular ""amphitheaters"" full of millions of vertical spires of red rock, known as ""hoodoos.""

What a wonderful experience.About an hours drive north of Zion, the park is an easy drive taking you along HWY15 at a speed limit of 80mph.The park gets crazy busy so I would recommend that you get there early to find a parking spot and to see the sights.The info sheets they hand out about the park and trails are pretty poor. They make it really difficult to try and plan out your hikes for they day.My recommendation would be to to take the shuttle right to the end of the line which is the first major lookout. From there take the trail to sunset point. This will allow you to circumvent the entire canyon on foot. A fairly easy hike, it will take you about 3 to 4 hours to complete. The many views of the hoodoo's are incredible and you will be constantly stopping to take pics.When you make it back to the lodge, you have the option of taking a switch back trail down into the canyon along the sunrise trail.From here you see the cliff walls and look at the hoodoo's from the bottom up. The end of the trail leading back up to the top of the canyon can be very trying. So for those who may not be in great shape, I would suggest you take it easy with numerous rests, especially at such a high altitude.A stop at the campgound store will get you a beer on the patio for a dollar and a well deserved rest after a great day of hiking.If you plan on visiting Zion, take a day and visit Bryce. You will not be disappointed.","October 16, 2016",Unique and Beautiful.,275,"Brantford, Canada",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is a must do! By foot! My friend and I got up early to watch the sun rise this morning. It was worth getting up early for.The day turned out to be a perfect sunny clear day, not a cloud in the sky. There was breeze in the air. We started at sunset point, hiked the Navajo Loop. The hike was ultra pleasant. View! View! View! from the top, from the bottom, from the sides, all magnificent! sometimes jaw-dropping gorgeous!It was Indescribably, because one has to be there to experience the canyon ""awe"". We highly recommend it. It is a moderate hike. We have seen hikers from children to seniors. It is best to take your time, your own pace. There are thousands of surprising delightful spots, perfect for poster pictures or simply ""canyon"" immersion! (I mean, it is ok to pause, or sit, and just be in awe.)Comfortable, non-slip foot wear is highly recommended. I have seen flip flops & high heels; they don't work well on these hiking trails.Shuttle buses are convenient, and run every 15-20 minutes or so. You save time looking for parking. Park your vehicle & take the shuttle. The park does a wonderful job accommodating us park visitors.

Bryce Canyon National Park,over four months we visited fourteen national parks and this one definitely is one of the best. There are shuttle buss]es from parking areas in town which do a round trip through the park with three stops en route. So less private vehicles and even though it was peak holiday season it appeared less crowded. each of the stops is worth getting off at to walk around to the various view points. It is possible to walk all the way down to the bottom and between the pinnacles but do wear suitable shoes and remember water and sunscreen.,"October 15, 2016",lived up to the hype,108,Cape Town,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"I'm surprised that there's so much publicity on Zion but yet so many people do not visit Bryce Canyon NP which is a hop,skip & jump from Zion. The hoodoos in this NP is out of this world and the magnificent scenery created by them in the amphitheater is extra-terrestrial! As a matter of fact, one of my friends said the way these hoodoos are shaped and ""carved"", they must have been creations of ET's :)) If you have time for at least a day visit, do the Rim Trail starting at it's farthest point, Bryce Point, and walk back in the direction of the visitors center. Going this way, your hike is largely downhill and a much easier walk. Of course, if you're looking for more exercise do the opposite. Nevertheless, this is a must do. We did Rim Trail from mid morning to around noon and had lunch at the Lodge before continuing our hike the rest of the way. Expect about 3 hours to complete this trail if there is a photographer in your group.If you're interested in sunrise/sunset photos, forget about sunset and aim for sunrise photos as the sunset sun is largely blocked out and you do not get the same colorful hue as sunrise. We were directed by one of the rangers in the visiting center to watch sunset at the Paria View overlook instead of the Sunset Point due to crowds and parking being much better at the Paria View and the directional sun is much better at Paria. Do not take this approach and don't even bother with waiting for sunset in the park as it is just not worth killing time waiting for the sunset.Aside from this piece of ""bad"" advice, the rangers in the visitors center are very helpful in explaining the hiking trail routes and difficulties, so do visit the center before heading out to explore this grand park.","October 15, 2016",A Must Do If You're Doing Zion NP,258,california,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,We went for one of the walks from Sunset Point down into the canyon. Doing this gets you away from the tourists who congregate at the rim at the top but are too lazy to have a decent walk. It becomes very peaceful and it is stunning scenery. Well worth the visit. Quite a small park in American terms so would say about 2 days would complete it. We only had a day but felt this was enough though would have stayed longer if we had time.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We are a bit irritated because we bought an annual pass when intending to visit 3 or 4 parks during our trip to the USA, only to find that if you trot up early enough, the park is open access: the same applies before sunset when the pay booths are closed. Even more importantly, one of the best and least populated walks - Rim Walk/Fairyland Walk - start outside the park! So, we thoroughly recommend Bryce Canyon, but don't bother paying, just get up early, enjoy the sunrise and have a great visit. To be clear, we were very happy to pay and think it is right to do so, but just feel a bit ripped off and conned into paying for something that is essentially free!","October 14, 2016",Excellent and NO NEED TO PAY TO ENTER,161,"London, United Kingdom",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We were in Bryce NP 3 nights and really loved it. The geologic formations must be seen to be believed. We walked the rim trail and a couple of other trails. There is a lot to do and I am sure others have included comments on the major vistas. This morning we got up early and headed to Rainbow Point. We got there before most of the crowds and hiked the short loop trail there, and then did portions of some other trails that came through. This place was so blessedly quiet compared to the crowds at the rest of the park. We really appreciated it! Definitely recommend that you don't pass this one by.Other comments...the park has added a shuttle to take people to the various sites and they do a good job of it. You can park before the park entrance and just jump on the bus, and the buses run every 12-15 minutes. You can still drive in but parking is very limited. We felt the shuttle was really do-able.

If you got the legs for 3-6 hr. hikes that drop down 1000 ft. and then come back near the top, more than once during each hike, then hiking the Peekaboo and Fairyland loop trails will be etched into your memory for the rest of your life.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This was my favorite Utah national park, I was so fascinated with the hoodoos. The beautiful and bizarre rock spires known as hoodoos are pinnacles or odd-shaped rocks left standing by forces of erosion. They are mostly orange, but some are red or white. The color comes from iron oxidizing in the rocks. Here you can see miles and miles of hoodoos, one of the most spectacular scenic wonders in the world. If you ride the shuttle, remember to get off at the first or second stop to see the hoodoos. We could not hear our driver and the shuttle takes you back to the visitor center. We took a short hike on the Rim Trail from Sunset Point to Sunrise Point, fabulous views below us. Do go to the part of the park reached only by car. We went to Rainbow Point, the highest point in the park at 9115 feet. The views are different from the other side and beautiful.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"My husband and I enjoyed the Navajo Loop trail and Wall Street section, driving the many Park overlooks like Natural Bridge, and seeing the glowing hoodoos at Sunset Point. They reminded me of my grandmother's old glowing mica stove. The many tour buses that descend on the Point at sunset are a detraction. By the time that we got to the Point, one could barely get to the viewing fence overlooking the remaining hoodoos that were still in the setting sun. The area walkways were literally covered with a ""forest"" of camera tripods set up by tour group members, and a few others. The guides must time the sunset to the exact moment. Some group members had both a camera on a tripod set up on the sidewalk at the Point, and were roving about with yet another expensive camera not on a tripod. One lady had a baby in a carriage, which she left on the sidewalk along the viewing fence with the tripod, attended by what looked to be a preschool child, while she went looking for a place to take more photos. To keep the preschool child happy, the child was left with some sort of an electronic game, which had the volume turned up for the game. The Point was a zoo. Not the peaceful, reflective, experience that one thinks are the national parks.","October 10, 2016","The hoodoos at sunset are beautiful, but in a zoo setting",154,"Middletown, Connecticut",5

I would suggest starting at sunrise, to try and avoid a lot of the crowds..There was busload after busload after busload of tourists arriving and as you get later into the morning/day, the viewing locations became overrun with people..! But, go nonetheless...!! I would set aside a full day to do just Bryce Canyon as to do it in an hour or two just will not do you, your experience or the canyon any justice..! I, in fact, went back the next morning to photograph sunrise and then photograph and walk Sunset Pt...This is a definite must do...The walk is 1.3 mile loop, taking you to the bottom of the canyon with the most beautiful landscapes..! I did the 1.6 mile going down and the 1.7 mile going back...I think the 1.7 mile is the harder walk going back as it seems steeper..It's advised that photographing sunrise at Sunset Pt. is better than at Sunrise Pt..And I tend to agree...More hoodoos, rock formations, pins to shoot that also reflect the early morning light, which can add a mystic touch; with the early light and shadows bouncing off the rocks...Go, experience and enjoy...!","October 2, 2016",Bryce Canyon...Exceptional...!,32,"Antioch, California",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce is a definitely a different experience than some of the other national parks I have visited.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We spent most of the day in a steady downpour under an overcast, thundery sky. The sun came out once while driving the most scenic route in America, Route 12, on our way to Bryce Canyon National Park, so, for a brief moment, we saw the glistening sections of rock we had been told about but were unable to see due to so much cloud coverage.Under the influence of thick rain clouds, the otherwise breath-taking, mind-blowing scenery appeared In either mundane shades of everyday gray, or were totally obscured by fog.Talk about fog! We witnessed it at its finest. Patches of fog formed between pines like webbing between toes . . . fog connected branches like cobwebs in the rafters of an old barn, fog stuffed into spaces, cementing rocks together like Elmer's glue, resting on horizons like moss on the crest of the world.Even though it's another week away, October was already influencing the trees in shades of peachy pastels and deep golds, which stood out against the dark shades of the pine trees that lined the winding road.Shivering poplars shook in the wind, and, against the black back drop of pines, as unexciting as it sounds, the movement was actually fascinating to behold. Like living Christmas lights, or tiny suns, each leaf lit up the roadside as we passed along.Most of the time, rain peppered the windshield in tiny white dots that could be heard individually one-by-one, as they tapped against the glass.The weather cleared for about four miles on Route 12 which allowed us to enjoy a stretch that took us along the crest of a cliff with a steep drop-off on either side! A swerve too much in either direction and we would have been on our heads at the bottom of a canyon!The panorama resembled those of the South Dakota Badlands, only on steroids! Paul Bunyan-sized boulders, mountains, and canyons, some white as snow, and others painted with a brush dipped in every shade of gray in existence.Areas of rocks made of red clay came into view and then right back out again to be replaced with the ubiquitous signs of adverse weather; fingers of deep gray clouds pouring streams of rain from the sky as though some giant hand were using a watering can on the blooms of an English country garden.The canyons in Capital Reef National Park flooded overnight and flash floods were occurring all day today! We left that park in the nick of time!A flash flood comes from afar on cloudless days and weighs as heavy as 113 elephants; that's 2.6 elephants rolling down the wash per second! The flood waters are inky black, ugly streams of burnt umber water, thick as oil, filled with debris; mainly branches of all sizes, lengths, and weights. Being overcome by such flood tides would be a horrible way to die!At an elevation of 6,600 feet, the rain turned into sleet, and, later, small spheres of hail which caused sections of the paved road to fill up with snow.Although mountain lions and bighorn sheep were in all the brochures, mule deer, wild turkey, and a few pronghorn antelope dominated the wildlife circuit throughout the duration of our trip so far, unless you want to include free-ranging cattle and rabbits.The 9,600 feet in elevation could be felt in the ears as though they were stuffed with cotton.Parts of the drive took us between mountains of nondescript rock which looked the way you would expect to see terrain on the moon. I could look around and imagine we had landed in the midst of these rocks via space ship and that we were, indeed, space travelers examining the surface of the moon.The sides of some mountains resembled ships and appeared as though they had washed ashore and were grounded forever on the banks of a desert sea.Although there were many rock formations called hoodoos, and a natural arch so huge it was hard to imagine, Bryce Canyon's main drive is through pine forests and not so much mountains of rock formations, buttes, and mesas. Elk, mountain lion, and coyotes make their homes there.This canyon is supposed to hold the darkest skies in the USA. I guess that's true under clear skies or cloudy!","September 28, 2016",Bryce at its Best,2,,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Road Trip home from CA. Visited Bryce Canyon National Park ( after seeing Zion ) and were taken aback by the sheer breath of the different canyon sites. If Zion is rated at 100, then Bryce is a 95 ( Still worth the journey ). I advise that you take the 18 mi road to the end, then see the sites one at a time on your way back to the Visitors Center. From the very start, the Vistas are jaw dropping ( It's amazing how awe inspiring the Vistas are ).The turn outs for each stop are usually paved and adequate to handle the traffic.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"From the hoodoos to Fairyland, Bryce has some very unusual geological formations. The elevation also plays a role- the day we went in late September there was snow accumulation on the ground. That added an extra special touch to the park vegetation and formations. In contrast to Zion National Park, use of the shuttle system in Bryce is optional, giving more freedom in viewing- but it also adds to the vehicle traffic in the park. We thoroughly enjoyed exploring many of the unique features of this park.","September 26, 2016",Diverse viewing opportunities,37,,5

I went at sunrise in September. I had to add a second sweater that early in the morning, but it was comfortable and the highlight of my whole trip. The park was awkward logistically. Shuttles ran to the more crowded areas. We were initially unable to park at the visitor center or even within any clear place where we could even walk to a shuttle stop (they were doing work on the visitor center parking lot and everything nearby was full). Inspriration point and sunset point are must see areas.

We did go all the way to the end of the main park road thus being able to finally get some of the views that Bryce is famous for. And Bryce is a beautiful place,a place where one can see the effects of long term erosion on the landscape. I've seen lately how America's national parks have become so popular and rightly so but this could be a case of being a victim of their own success.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Anything I could try to say about Bryce Canyon would only understate the majesty of the place. You should either plan to spend about 4 hours or 3 days when you go. There's a scenic drive that gives you a feel for the the number and variety of hoodoos and other erosive features. You can definitely complete the scenic drive in 3-4 hours, with plenty of time to stop at overlooks - one tip is to drive all the way out to the end without stopping and use the return trip to stop, look, take photos, and be amazed. All of the pullouts are on the right as you return. You can pick up a guided tour bus outside the park, and one of the tours was stopping at the same viewpoints we were. Based on what I overheard from the tour guide, Mostly what he seemed to do was point out certain hoodoos and tell everyone what it looked like. I wouldn't bother with the tour, unless you don't have access to a car, or have a serious imagination deficit.But - you really need to plan on several days to properly appreciate the park. All the trails go down from the ridge into the various features, which is the best way to see them. However - because they go down, you'll have to finish by hiking uphill. It's not an insurmountable hike, but you need to keep in mind that you're hiking at 8,000 feet, and the air is thinner.A night sky viewing is an absolute must-do. As you've probably seen in the literature, Bryce is so remote that it's virtually free of light pollution. We went to a ranger talk at night which was followed by a telescope viewing of the night sky (telescopes provided by and supervised by the park). It was one of the rare times we could clearly see the Milky Way. The only problem was that it was also a full moon, and the moon was so bright it made it harder to see stars, until moon-set.","September 23, 2016",Defies description,69,"Boise, Idaho",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"After being overwhelmed by the hoodoo's approaching the park, we LEARNED what geological things happen over long periods of time that make these formation so spectacular. How did this happen?We had only a few hours when we arrived, it started raining, but we persevered. We stopped in the Visitor's Center. The film there is a MUST to see BEFORE touring the features of the Park. We learned all of the forces of nature that come together over immense spans of time to cause these magnificent formations.When we emerged the rain had become a slight sprinkle. So we decided to drive on out to Inspiration Point. NOTE: We were told to take buses because parking would be full. With the rain, we decided to drive out furthest and take our chances with parking and then work our way back. We were richly rewarded. If you are there on a clear sunny crowded day, I do not recommend this. BUT I would recommend riding to the end and working your way back. Especially if you have limited time in the park.The road to Bryce Point was closed due to maintenance. I think we need to respect this in our National Parks as they take time and resources to maintain. IF you have several days or even a full day, I would take some of the walking trails like those at Fairyland and Queens Garden. There are several days of activities and learning a family could do here. We met a kind young man with his son. They were camping!! That is the best way to experience these parks. They even saw the light show the night before when the heaven's opened up like sparklers. It was some kind of satellite that entered earth's atmosphere over southern Utah!!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This park is beautiful and has incredible rock formations you won't find anywhere else. Start with a brief stop at the visitor center to get your bearings. The ranger recommended we do the Queens Garden - Navajo Loop trail, which was also recommended by others. We started at Sunrise Point and went clockwise. When you get to Navajo Loop, it splits into two trails that both lead to Sunset Point back on the rim. We opted for the Wall Street route, which climbs up through a narrow canyon with the help of a bunch of small switchbacks. It's a fun, but moderately strenuous climb back up. If you start at Sunset Point and follow the trail counterclockwise to Sunrise Point, you can walk downhill through Wall Street then have a more gradual climb back up the Queens Garden side. The entire hike is about 3 miles round trip and takes about 2 hours (with kids, at an easy pace). It's a beautiful and enjoyable hike, and is a great way to see the park up close.

Bryce was part of a larger trip that included Zion, and in hindsight I wish we would have added one day to Zion and taken one day away from Bryce, but this may be because it rained for much of our Zion time. (We had 2.5 days in Bryce and 3.5 days in Zion.)There are hotels, gas stations, and ""ye olde western shops"" aplenty in Bryce Canyon City which is located right before you enter the park.

Bryce Canyon National Park,The altitude got to us so we knew hiking was limited. It so happens that the rim walk from inspiration point to sunrise point is all you need to see. Unbelievable. It took us about 3 - 3 1/2 hours to walk the rim. We stopped and looked for awhile. Many pictures were taken. The next day we drove in the park to rainbow point and drove back stopping at all the viewpoints. It was beautiful.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We were visiting our National Parks in Southern Utah and set time aside to visit Bryce. We are glad we did. We elected to take the 36 mile round trip scenic drive to take advantage of the views with our limited time. The scenic overlooks and photo opportunities were fantastic. The photos in brochures and online are awesome but really can't portray how beautiful rock and flora really are. If in this part of the state, don't pass up an opportunity to see some of the greatest views in America.","September 19, 2016",Simply Amazing,59,"Crossville, Tennessee",5

Get up, close and personal with the hoodoos on the Navajo loop, do not skip this trail or you will miss the ultimate experience and super stunning views. Steep descent into the canyon and somewhat strenuous ascent, may appear daunting. Just take your time, take lots of pics and breaks, drink lots of water, gawk at its beauty! Shaded in late afternoon.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"First of all the canyon is beautiful. Was there for sunrise and sunset. Second, there is a severe parking problem. The place is a mad house. Overlook points are full and they won't let you near the place. You end up driving around to kill time .... drove past Inspiration Point entrance 3 times and it was blocked off. Finally got to get in after an hour or more. Extremely congested areas..... avoid the middle of the day for sure. Many many foreign visitors, mostly Japanese, some are very rude. Hiked the Navajo Loop, beautiful but very strenuous. Hiked at day break and had the place to myself. You only need one day here, we went for a few hours the first evening till sunset and 2 hours the next morning and that was enough. Not a huge place.","September 18, 2016",Great views !!,69,"Stewartstown, Pennsylvania",4
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is open year round so just pick a time of year and go visit. We visited (again) in the fall this year and it was excellent. Yes, it's a national park and gets busy so be patient when traveling thru it. It wasn't really that bad in mid September but some of the overlooks get quite crowded. If you are a photographer, you definitely want to get up and into the park before sunrise...you basically have all the spots all to yourself. You won't be disappointed in the park.","September 18, 2016",What can I say? Bryce Canyon is excellent,68,"Sandy, Utah",5

The bright colors mixed with the trees and the blue sky were something to see, pictures just don't capture all of the beauty in this park. There is a great drive through the park and this affords you lots of stops at overlooks and trail heads. One thing to do is drive all the way to the end loop in the road, then stop at all of the overlooks and trail heads on the way back. This way the stops will all be on the right side of the highway, making entering and exiting a lot easier. The Park does get crowded on some days, but not bad early in the morning. On our visit the evening sky got cloudy, so we did not do the Night Sky Tour, but it is one of the major attractions in the park.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Bryce Canyon is about a varied a landscape as you are going to find. Nature has carved the rocks into incredible shapes. The park has a number of viewing points and trails. Visit as many as you can for a different viewing experience. Walk amongst the structures or hoodoos as they are called to get a close up view of this strange place. A good walk is to take the Navajo trail which starts at Sunset Point and returns you to the same place with a journey time of about an hour or so. You can extend this by incorporating the Queens loop and then the trail concludes at Sunrise point. This will double your walking time. Some of the trails are steep. The area is home to lots of chipmunks who scamper around keeping an eye on those that visit their canyon.,"September 16, 2016",Incredible landscape,85,"Penarth, United Kingdom",5

In Arches we felt like we were part of the park and in Bryce, you drive, get out at an overlook and look down on this vast place.

This method worked out really well other than for the last few viewing points.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I went with my retired parents to Bryce Canyon for the Labor Day weekend. They really enjoyed themselves. It's not so hot in September, and while I would have liked to have hiked more, enjoyed the beautiful nature and hoodoos. We stopped at the visitor center to use the restrooms, ask the rangers questions, and watch an introductory film. There is a small-ish museum that explains how the hoodoos were formed, Bryce's relationship to the other national parks in the area (i.e. Grand Canyon,) and how light pollution works. It's a great introduction to the park. We didn't take the shuttle and were able to drive ourselves to the farther lookout points (like Rainbow Point which was totally worth the drive.) Of course the main attraction is the amphitheater that has about 3 separate lookouts. Be sure to park within stalls--we saw people getting ticketed.","September 12, 2016",Beautiful and unlike anywhere else!,6,Utah,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is a place worth visiting and seeing the spectacular rock formations. The view of the hoodoos changes as the sun move across the sky. So to really appreciate the area you need to see it in the early morning and late afternoon as the light changes. To get a good perspective you need to take the short hike down into it, It is best to do that in the early morning or late in the day as at mid day it does get pretty warm.","September 12, 2016",Beautiful,55,"Barneveld, New York",5

Best to arrive early in the day for ease of parking, during the summer vacation season, parking quickly fills up and you will be forced to park at the entrance of the park and take a shuttle bus into the park. But don't fear, no matter how you enter the park, it is all worth it for those views up along the canyon ridge. Gorgeous!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Until you actually see it you can't believe it exists! The vista as you reach the rim of the canyon extends in all directions with sandstone spires capped with limestone, creating the hoodoos through water erosion at this specific altitude of 7,600 feet. Higher up and it freezes too much, lower and it's not the ideal conditions to create these intriguing formations. Silent City conjures up the Paiute Indian folkore that bad people inhabited the canyon and Coyote, the trickster God, invited them all to a feast and turned the bad people into stone. Check out the Sentinel rock, Thor's Hammer and Queen Victoria on her throne! This is the best of the National Parks on this area! Catch a NPS ranger for a guided tour or just catch the shuttle and drop off at one of the higher points and leisurely walk the rim trail down to a lower point and jump back on the shuttle back yo base.

I was a bit surprised that the exhibit wasn't as detailed as I was expecting, though still informative enough. Extensive gift shop. The park itself shows that it has the money for more upkeep than other parks. Lots of good ranger-led activities. We listened to the astronomy talk at the amphitheater. Driving through the park allows you to stop at multiple destinations and overlooks/hikes. There are many great suggestions as to which hike you should do, depending on your ability. There are several restaurants just outside the park entrance but there are more choices -10 miles away which aren't as ""touristy"" and expensive.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited all the National Parks in Utah and this was the most amazing of all of them. The Hoodoos sprang up from the earth in an eerie way and it looked like an alien planet. You can walk a trail down to the floor bottom if you want to, but we declined due to our health. We rode the free shuttle bus and it is highly recommended as parking is limited. Who wants to be driving when you can sit back on the shuttle and enjoy the scenery. They drop you off and pick you up every 15 minutes. Make sure you have a hat, sunscreen, and plenty of water.","September 7, 2016",Breathtaking! Literally!,51,"Salem, Oregon",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"As others have said, you have to see it to believe it! Jaw-dropping! The viewpoints are well signposted and plenty of parking seemed to be available (we were there in July). Allow at least half a day or more to see it properly. As the sun moves across the sky, the rock seems to change colour and gives you a different landscapes to view. It's a long drive from everywhere, so it's not worth rushing!! A must-see if you get the opportunity! The annual park pass at $80 is worth buying if you are planning to visit other national parks in the US.","September 7, 2016",Absolutely outstanding!,117,"Charentay, France",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is probably one of the most special places we visited ever!!! When first Arrived at noon we went to the Sunrise point and our breath stopped for a few seconds while observing this view. Was a little rainy day but still had the chance of catching some truly amazing nature wonders sights… Drove 30 min to the far end point called Yovimpa Point and rainbow point (very impressive also but we liked the hoodoos points better) and stopped along the view points on our way back. At most of the points we were able to find a free parking space right away. Recommended points: Inspiration point (was close for some reason and on our way back luckily got opened to the public again – this was by far our best hoodoos view point! Sunrise points Natural bridge pointRainbow point We weren’t interested in walking trails so the whole viewpoints stops tour to the canyon took us about 4 hours to complete in an easy going pace and tons of marvels pictures. Note: park entrance fee was included with the park annual pass we have purchased at Zion earlier that week (pass is 80$) has a great value if you are planning to visit a lot of national parks. Try to arrive there with snacks and water there are not many options for buying stuff in the canyon. Note 2: we came back at 22:00 for and independent star gazing which was an awesome experience, just stood and stared at a million shining stars… Highly recommended!!!","September 6, 2016",WOW,75,Israel,5

The view was amazing and any hikes are pretty easy. However, Coin laundry and shower facilities are not really convenient as you have to bike/drive your car to get there. And the business hours was not long enough. There was a free WiFi at info centre near the entrance of national park, but not easy to connect. In fact, it did not work well except one time. Took me more than 10min to connect. ","September 5, 2016",Always wanted to go there,27,,4
Bryce Canyon National Park,"This park is otherworldly. Seriously, my son and I joked that martians came to earth and left this behind as a practical joke. We hiked down into the canyon and it didn't disappoint. I can honestly say that nothing about this place disappointed. Whatever you think it will be like, seeing it in person is even better. Be prepared there is a pretty tough climb in and out of the canyon. That said it is worth it. The combination of the orange stone, the green pine trees and blue sky is absolutely stunning. Make sure you have plenty of memory on your camera. You will need A word to those with small children, there are many many ledges without guardrails or fencing. It is slightly terrifying with big kids, I can't imagine trying to do the park with a toddler or preschooler. Even a teenager is enough to induce a cold sweat and heart palpitations.","September 5, 2016",Spectacular,15,,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited as part of a biking trip and Bryce was a wow. We stayed in the park and were able to enjoy the miles of biking paths and great views. Stay within the park if you can. We were derailed from a hike by a sudden hail storm but because we were staying in the lodge we were able to head right out to the trail after the storm ended, we pretty much had the trail to ourselves. Can't do that if you are staying in town. It's a national park for a reason, just beautiful. ","September 5, 2016","Yup, it's a keeper!",90,"Boston, Massachusetts",5

It was much cooler at the top with thunder storms in the late afternoon.

It was opened for a short time during which we drove the 18 miles along the canyon top, stopping along the way for views and pictures. Only saw a small amount due to snow and fog. We were unable to do any hiking, again due to the snow. Not much around Bryce Canyon.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"What an odd, otherworldly place this is! The rock formations (hoodoos) and colors are amazing. We stopped at all of the pullouts and each seemed so different. We drove all the way to the top, the temperature change was impressive. There are areas that have obviously had fires. We saw a lot of deer and some grazing cattle. Wish we had more time to do some of the hikes, but would need to be acclimated to the altitude first. Highly recommend, but go before sunset as the shadows cast some darkness on the formations so hard to photograph adequately.","September 1, 2016",Hoodoos,52,"Austin, Texas",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"I found Bryce to be more beautiful and spectacular than the Grand Canyon. My wife prefers the Grand Canyon, to each their own. The rock formations created by the wind and moisture erosion cannot be described in words and pictures cannot capture the outstanding views. The rich colors of the rocks is beyond belief. We visited mid-week in late August, at some vista areas parking was difficult. We missed one because we could not park within legal guidelines.

No warning signs outside that the entire large parking area at the lower main area for viewing/hiking is completely closed off. NO access. There is one other parking area that holds maybe 30 cars. We rode to the top and worked our way back down, checking out most of the pull outs. This year is the 100 anniversary of the park service. So, the crowd was large. They were also crabby and combative. We watched several near-misses with vehicles, general bad and selfish driving, witnessed a shouting match....all-around bad vibe this time so we decided to get out and head west.","August 31, 2016","Previous visit awesome, this one was expensive and half the lower main area is inaccessble",13,"Tijeras, New Mexico, United States",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I'm really glad I was here before, but we came again since we were headed to the north rim and decided to go into the park late yesterday. They charge full price even though we were going for sunset ($30.00). The ranger not once mentioned - by the way the road to rainbow point is closed, several view stops are closed and the road to Bryce point and Paria are closed.When we were here before Bryce point was closed because of snow, it is one of the reasons we came back.When you have this much of the park closed, first the price should be reduced but most importantly you should be told this BEFORE paying.The other thing that really stood out here is they tell you NO parking along the road, but they provide very few viewing stops, there was a lot of wildlife out at this time, but you couldn't stop to take pictures etc. Bryce isn't a very big park, they charge full price, you really don't get the value here that you do in Arches and Canyonlands.I understand road repairs etc. have to be made, but on both the road to Rainbow and Bryce we did not see any equipment and quite frankly they should not be done at the same time if that is what was happening.Am very disappointed in the management of the particular park.","August 30, 2016","DISAPPOINTED THIS TIME, HALF THE PARK CLOSED",31,"Melbourne Beach, Florida",3

Couple things: Be sure to see the sunrise at least once but prepare for the very chilly temperatures, even in the middle of summer. The horseback tour thru Canyon Trail Rides is an absolute MUST.

Nevertheless, every stop is a picture moment, offering several breathtaking photo opportunities. Absolutely amazing! The hike down to the Rim is moderate so def wear hiking boots or good shoes, water and sun screen. Supposedly, the Queens Garden Trail offers the least strenuous descent to the rim but still, it is not for the cardiovascular challenged (in my opinion). Combined with the multitude of look-outs, experiencing Bryce National Canyon can be accomplished in one day. Its unique beauty is well worth it.","August 29, 2016",Awesome,59,Florida,5

Each viewpoint is different and beautiful: Black Birch Canyon, Agua Canyon, etc. We were able to see it all in less than three hours, taking pictures and making short hikes. This is the way to get the lay of the land before deciding if you feel like hiking any of the trails. If not, just a lovely time to get some outstanding photos.

We have hiked down the Kayenta/Navajo loop trail and back up Queen's Garden in the past but we opted to just watch this time. Enjoyed a great little buffet lunch in the Bryce Canyon Lodge.

Anthelope Canyon (Not a NP and very small, but definitely worth seeing, near Page,AZ) and The Brice Canyon.We spent one day in the second one which we felt was enough. This park has very stunning vistas to enjoy the multi-layer reddish formations,some with hoodoos. You must take one of the hikes (We did the Navajo Loop) to go down the canyon, to get a closer look at the formations. You need to be in reasonably good shape for this 2-3 hour hike and must bring plenty of water.Taking the shuttle is the way to go. Buses are frequent (10-15 minutes).

Wow - just sweet views. The morning sunlight hitting the spires was real cool. Added some decent depth to the images.Thoroughly enjoyed our hike down to the bottom - warning if you are not in decent shape or do not have decent foot ware plan on a miserable time. If you are in relatively decent shape - not talking Mt Everest climbing ability here but the hike out can be hard if it is hot out, the walk down and out is very rewarding. Awesome views to be had for sure - several arches and cool things at the bottom really enhanced our hike.My bro in law and his wife have taken the horse ride option - they liked it alot - I prefer to be my own mule!!Would def recommend this to anyone.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Do not settle for the drive around the viewpoints (though that seems to be what most people do). At the very least do the Navajo trail, which is all of leas than a mile (but very steep). The scenery here is just stunning - so different and beautiful. We made a figure of eight hike of about 5 miles, and had the canyon to ourselves: We must have seen all of about 20 people in the three hours it took.","August 23, 2016",Stunning majesty.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"It's a long drive to this Park from Scottsdale, AZ. but well worth it. The views, the rock formations, the various colors and the different levels of hiking available have made the time and money well spent. I would say that in many ways it is visually more impressive than even the Grand Canyon! Certainly, there are more hiking trails of varying levels of difficulty and strenousness than I recall there were at the Canyon. It was quite crowded today at Bryce but I think that is to be expected at almost all National Parks this time of year.","August 22, 2016",This is our first visit and well-worth the trip!,60,"Scottsdale, Arizona",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,I know everyone probably says Amazing but it was the first thing that comes to mind when I hear or say the name. You drive thru Valleys and up and down mountains and then all of the sudden you see these red pillars jetting out of the mountainside.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"So very different from Zion which we hiked the day before, The hoodoos are the main attraction and we did relatively easy hikes compared to Zion - the Queens Garden hike and the Navajo Loop. Unlike Zion, you're not required to use the park shuttle although there is not a lot of parking at the trailheads. We were there on a Sunday at it was crowded. We were lucky enough to find a spot (as others were leaving) at both trailheads we went to, Just outside the park is a general store which was like a mini grocery store. We bought steaks and vegetables and cooked dinner that night when we got back to our cabin in Duck Creek Village, There are however a handful of restaurants outside the park that stay open after sundown where we could have eaten, We spent a full day there hiking and i guess we could have done another day but one full day is probably enough for most people.

Bryce Canyon National Park,No trip to Utah will be complete unless you include a day at Bryce Canyon; it is one of the most beautiful places on Earth.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce is One of the most beautiful national parks we have ever seen. From the very beginning, the canyons open up in front of you with gorgeous vistas of red and white rocks in thousands of colorful layers and formations. It isn't one of those hikes where you need to walk for hours just to get above the tree lines to see anything - you have those views straight from the start of the trail all the way until the end of it. There are so many spots to take beautiful pictures of the surrounding rocks and scenery. The trail takes you down into the canyons, and then zigzags you back out. Highly recommended!","August 21, 2016",Bryce is One of the most beautiful national parks,478,"Springfield, Virginia",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce is one place I have always wanted to visit and I was not disappointed. We only had a half of day there, due to other outstanding issues getting to the National Park, but we were able to get our time in Bryce in this short amount of time.Parking at the lot in-between Sunrise and Sunset points, we were able to check out the entire Bryce Amphitheater from above before hiking down into the canyon. From Sunrise point, we followed Queen's Trail to the Queen Victoria Hoodoo and took the Navajo trail up to Sunset point. It was magical hike through the Hoodoos and Pine forests below.I recommend downloading the Hoodoo, which is the Bryce Canyon Newsletter onto a tablet (I download it onto my Kindle.) to review information about the park and what to expect. Each National Park has a newspaper and they can be accessible via their web page.) It is the same paper guide that they hand to you when you enter the park. Bryce's Newsletter is called the Hoodoo and it can be hard to find on their website.

Words can only begin to describe what you see. What you feel. We parked, walked 100 yards uphill toward a tree-stump guard rail. It literally wasn't until we got to that rail that we understood why this is a National Park. Or, better said, a National Treasure!Looking over the railing took our breath away. Literally and figuratively. The view drops down, goes up, goes out, to the right and left. It is spectacular. It doesn't have to be a long stop. It could be 2 hours. Or, it could be 2 days if you want to hike and camp. Whatever you imagine in your mind for this, it will be infinitely better!","August 21, 2016",Wow! Wow! Wow!,274,"Durham, North Carolina",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We only had a day and a half, but we fit in several hikes. If you're short on time, be sure to do the Navajo Loop and Queen's Garden, starting from Sunset Point. We took the shuttle and it worked out beautifully. No fighting for parking spots, and the shuttle comes every 10 minutes. We enjoyed a guided moonlight hike at Fairyland Point. We listened to a ""geology talk"" at Sunset Point. The rangers are extremely helpful and are interesting and energetic when giving a talk. It definitely increased my appreciation of the area!

But there's always a spot away from the crowds if you're prepared to walk. If parking is difficult, (and the small parking lots fill up early) leave the car at Ruby's Inn and take a shuttle bus. (Price included in your park pass). The rim walk is paved and easy to walk and for wheelchairs allowing everyone to experience the beauty of this enchanted spot.

It was totally amazing! The climb up out of the canyon will test you if you're not a little bit fit but take your time and it's worth it.I can't put into words how beautiful the scenery is. There are quite a few reviews on here that refer to car journeys and the scenery from the road side. Believe me, if you don't get out of your car and actually get down there in amongst the incredible hoodoos, you'll be missing so much! Ok, not everyone can hike the trails but if you can, you really MUST do it! We went in June when it was fairly warm and we saw so many different ""critters"".

We did the Sunset to Sunrise points hike, and the Navajo Loop trail (and Wall Street) to Queens Garden hike.

We took the 3 hour horseback ride to get up close and personal to the hoodoos and the view from below. Zion, Bryce and North Rim of Grand Canyon was a great little circle trip.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I last visited Bryce as a 10 year kid and thought it was best National Park I had seen. Now 50 years and a few more National Parks later, it is still the best. Hiking down into the canyon is worth it as the views and perspective are totally different than from the rim. Beware though that what goes down must come up and the hike up to Sunset Point is very taxing and much harder that the trail rating of moderate. I would recommend going down from Sunset Point and then back up at Sunrise point. Most people will be able to do this in 2 hours or less.We drove the 18 miles to the top of the park and then stopped at every view point on the way down. Each stopped looked different and more spectacular than the previous one.

We started at 7:30 AM when the temps were cool, but it got hot quickly. You definitely do not want to be going out at Noon.

Leaving Zion you actually go passed the third shuttle stop. This is the ""scenic road"" that is open year round and so worth driving it even if you don't take the 2.5hr. Drive to Bryce NP. But if you have the time. Go to Bryce!!! This park just feels so personal. Even with a crowd it seems very peaceful and a joy to hike. I have to say for how small it felt to Zion. The signs and hikes could've been marked better. It was a bit confusing. Had we know to go to inspiration point from the other hikes we could've walked the rim trail to it instead of driving and hoping we got a parking spot. We did get a spot but when we drove we missed the turn because the y had no sign to turn for inspiration point. After we went out of our way a couple miles we turned around.

Of all the hikes we did, the Bryce Navajo Loop, culminating in the hike up Wall Street, surrounded by the hoodoos, was by far my family's favorite. The beauty is very literally breathtaking, and the scenery stunning and varied. The colors are utterly amazing, and this is truly Nature's beauty at its finest. We were inspired to come to Utah in the first place by an IMAX film celebrating the National Parks' Centennial, and one of the main features in the film was Bryce. We were a little afraid it couldn't possibly look like *that* in person, and not only was it as beautiful as on film, but being surrounded 360 degrees by that much splendor was just awe-inspiring.

Not only did this person put himself in danger, he also put others lives at risk. Special thanks to all who keep this park safe. We also did another walk, which was a more strenuous walk.

We visited 8 National Parks on our visit to the States and this for me was top of the list just for its beauty and unusual rock formations.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon, or really amphitheater, is a very scenic park. However, it is fairly small and does not have many hiking trails. This is my 4th visit so finding something new to do is difficult. Visitors are best advised to drive all the way to Rainbow Point then make their way back toward the entrance stopping at the viewpoints. Rainbow Pt. has the Bristlecone Pine trail of 1.1 miles and is relatively shaded. There is the rim trail that goes for several miles, but it does not offer better views than the official overlooks. The most popular trail is the Queen's Garden/Navajo Loop which drops down at Sunset Pt. into the best formations and returns via Sunrise Pt. Then you must finish the loop via the rim trail or take the shuttle bus. Peek-a-boo and Fairyland trails are longer. That's basically all there is to do. The cabins at the lodge look very nice, and especially if you can get one near the rim. Campgrounds are not very attractive in my opinion so location must be the rationale.

They are paved and wind through the trees. I'd rate them at easy to moderate.- The town of Bryce is about 10 minutes from the park, so it's easy access to groceries, fast food, hotels and restaurants.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Can't recommend this place enough. If you are considering a trip to southern Utah be sure to visit Bryce Canyon. It is so unique with stunning rock formations and bright orange colors. There are hikes of varied difficulties within the park. The visitor center is very helpful with planning your trip. They will answer any questions you may have. Sunrise and sunset are incredible times to see the park because the colors really pop. The scenic overlooks are wonderful but if you are able to hike in, I highly recommend it. You get to look up at the hoodoos and see a completely different perspective. Bring water, it gets very hot in the summer. ","August 2, 2016",Two thumbs up!,15,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,This is a must see national park. If you haven't visited you should. I have ever seen anything like it. Hiking among the Hoodoos was simply awesome. Everyone in my family loved this place. It is also quite manageable and you can really cover it well in two days. The hike down the Navajo trail along Wall Street (the right side of the loop as you descend is amazing. From there you can do the Peekaboo trail loop which is a 3 mile loop with stunning views. The hike down to the the Tower Bridge is also a must. My wife took the rim trial to inspiration point and said it was fantastic.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This park did not disappoint and although we only had one day here, we packed a lot in. We did not bother getting the free shuttle, as we wanted to go right to the very end, which we did and then stopped off at all panoramic viewpoints down the Canyon. At the time we visited, we were able to park, but were lucky, as someone had just departed. The views are spectacular and each stop,off point give a different perspective.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This park has the best of many of the surrounding national parks in Utah. It has arches, windows, and Thor's hammer along with the Queen's Court all made out of sand stone which creates a scenic wonderland. Sunrises and sunsets are stunning in this park if you can time this. It does cost to enter for $35.00 a car unless you purchase the national park pass for $80.00 to visit multiple parks and it is good for a year. We would have spent over $150.00 otherwise, without this pass. We started at the far end and worked our way back to the entrance after stopping at the visitor's center first. This helps with traffic issues since most the overviews are on the left hand side going in. You must enter and exit the same way because there are no through roads in the park. You stop at the canyon for the best view! Star gazer's will find this a favorite because the night sky is just brilliant with stars.There are several hiking trails and horseback riding excursions on and off the park. Stop at Ruby's before entering the park for more options of things to do. If storms approach, be cautious and look for cover or go to your car.","July 29, 2016",Chosen as a Family Favorite,33,"Grove City, Pennsylvania",5

I would call it an unofficial wonder of the world with its tall hoodoos and rolling landscape. I would even go as far as to say this is better than the grand canyon as it is closer and more intimate. There are also fewer people as its a bit further off the beaten track.There is a pleasant gift shop and lots of hiking trails that can also be done on horse back but you can also walk the length of the canyon ridge which I highly recommend.Visit it, you won't regret it!","July 27, 2016",Just astonishing.

We bought this in Yosemite for $80, and if you are visiting several national parks it'll save you money and time.Parking is free but limited. We got lucky and arrived at Sunset Point just as someone was pulling out of a space. There are toilets and a picnic area there. The views are incredible. You cannot believe the colour of the rock formations until you go there.My wife and I did the Navajo Loop, which takes you right down into the narrow canyons, past arches, bridges and incredible formations, including Thor's Hammer. It's very steep, so you need to be a bit fit and steady on your feet, but I thoroughly recommend this loop. It's about a mile and a half in total, and took us about an hour as we did it at a slow pace.

I would recommend going down on the left and continuing up through the trail to the right and make the ""loop"". The second half you are protected from the sun. We each had our water bottles and sun screen. Pack a few bandaids just in case someone falls. Take your time, enjoy the view.

Conveniently located within a few hours of both the North Rim of the Grand Canyon and Zion National Park, it is easy to make a Bryce Canyon part of a unique vacation.The hoodoos (large pillars shaped by erosion) are prominent in the park. The hiking options are numerous. We were only in Bryce for a day, and were able to see quite a bit of the park with 5 miles or so of hiking. If you're only doing a quick stop, I would suggest doing the Queen's Garden/Navajo Loop. We also did the Mossy Cave trail to see the waterfall, which was gorgeous.

I first visited here in the early 1980s. The park back then did not receive anywhere near the tourist traffic it does now. Still, everything seems to flow fairly well here, no real traffic jams. Though the park rangers are VERY adamant against speeders. They are always on the lookout for people driving too fast, so watch out if you visit. The trails are from very easy to difficult, so there is surely one or more that will suit your own adventure.

Stayed at Ruby's Best Western which was over-priced for the modest room but very convenient location to the park. They recommended taking the shuttle but we chose to drive our car and had no problem with parking. The visitors center was nice. We watched a short film about the Canyon and took a quick look at the displays. Although we already had our day planned out, there were helpful park staff there to answer questions. We went on the Navajo/Queens garden trail via Wall Street which is definitely not to miss. It was a great trail, took us about 2 hours. Did have some steep inclines but very manageable for active/semi-active people. We then took a drive up the scenic road and stopped at several look-out points.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is a beautiful national park which offers fantastic views and is ideal for hikers and cyclists of all levels. I loved it from start to finish. The hoodoos are incredible to look at and the photos turn out great since the contrast of blue skies and red-orange rock is just awesome!! In terms of getting around, I can highly recommend the free shuttle (though it is confusing to figure out their route). We stopped at all view points and the amazement of this stunning natural beauty never ceased. Bring binoculars to have your eye travel down the canyons and get some sort of perspective just of how mesmerizing the views are. One tip: When you go on the shuttle make sure you take your admission ticket with you. The shuttle leaves the park at some point and you need the ticket to get back into it. Nobody told us so we had to go to the ticket window and get a waiver (it was no big deal in the end but could have saved us some angry moments).

We were able to visit all viewpoints and was taken in awe with the amazing hoodoos and valleys.

So, instead we drove to Rainbow Point elevation 9,115 feet. As I mentioned before, I've been here previously. This time, I got altitude sickness. I had to stay in the car. The rest of my family hiked and did the Bristlecone loop trail. They also saw Hoodoos. The weather at Rainbow Point was much cooler than Zion. We had to put our sweaters on. For wheelchair accessible trails, check with the visitor center. There are a few trails that are paved. Restrooms are available in various areas but remember it is a national park.

You're a national park with thousands of visitors daily and you have no change. Unbelievable. Minus one star for that. Even with that minor hiccup, this is still one of the most beautiful national parks I have ever been to. From the very beginning, the canyons open up in front of you with gorgeous vistas of red, orange and white rocks in thousands of colorful layers and formations.The elevation gave the park nice cool weather while we were there at 85F. The rocks have a lot of character and so many colors in different lighting. All the points are accessible by shuttle or personal vehicle and you have plenty of trail options. The picture opportunities here are pretty spectacular and every overlook was better than the next. My favorite being Rainbow Point at 9115ft. My family and I simply marveled at how wondrous Mother Nature could be. The deep orange to red hues, all the different textures & formations, the moving clouds, the sun... it was all just amazing! Even you're unable to hike, as was our case this time around, you'll still be able to simply get out of your vehicle and look out over the beautiful overlooks. The entire scenic tour took us about 2 hours to complete. We traveled with children ages 5 and 2.Bryce Canyon is truly a wonder to behold and we certainly cant wait to return.

In addition, we were there on a Saturday, and most of the scenic point parking lots were completely full, with cars circling for spots! We were lucky enough to find a parking space at Inspiration Point (wow!), and planned to take the rim walk to Bryce Point. Unfortunately, the rim walk was close just south of our location, and Bryce Point was closed entirely, so our walk was much shorter than planned.

Bryce Canyon National Park,I couldn't believe one place could be so breathtaking! I had read a few reviews about the best way to hike Wall Street which was most helpful. My friend and I are not avid hikers so any suggestions were welcome. We decided to hike Sunset Point to Sunrise Point which was the best way to go. I don't think (I know) I wouldn't have been able to hike the switchbacks at the end. Doing that steep a descent at the beginning was the best. Yes as we got close to Sunrise Point there were portions of the trail that had a good incline but it was doable. We each had 2 L of water and it was gone by the time we got to the top. Also take protein and carb rich foods to keep your energy up. Don't forget to look behind you when you're on the trail the view is incredible. ,"July 18, 2016",Wall Street,1,,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Our trip was conducted by Adventure Photo Tours of Las Vegas, NV. From the time we did the telephone booking with them we felt we were dealing with a knowledgeable and professional group. Our 15-hour day trip started when the minibus met us at the tour lobby of The Venetian resort in Las Vegas, right on time. After a short breakfast stop on the way we were headed to the beautiful mountain regions of Nevada, then Arizona and finally Arizona. The picturesque surroundings coupled with an excellent tour guide/driver Marc, made it more enjoyable. Our first stop was at the Zion National Park. Going the on the highway cut from solid rocks in the city of St. George was an experience not to be forgotten. Our first major stop was at the Ranger station at Zion National Park. The Park Service had a trolley bus to carry visitors to various photo stops, but we stayed with our group and our guide Marc who knew the area's neat formations very well. Every spot was worthy of a photo shoot so it is good to have a good supply of shots on your photo discs! From Zion we proceeded to Bryce Canyon and our first stop was at Inspiration Point to admire the hoodoos! You simply have to remain mesmerized at the beautiful structures carved out on the rocks by wind and rain. If you let your imagination soar you will visualize all sorts of structures on the rock faces. Just a word of caution. If you can avoid the toilets at Inspiration Point, do so. They are crude 'outhouses'. If you can, wait for the restrooms at Sunset Point( next stop) or the Rest Areas along the way. Anyway, going back to the tour, our guide Marc made sure we had ample photo opportunities and he also took pictures of families and couples in the group. All told, the trip was well designed and suitable for those of us who cannot go hiking or climbing due to age or other physical constraints.","July 16, 2016","Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks, Utah",4,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5

The Navajo Fairland Loop is probably the best hike you can do here. Amazing views of the hoodoos as you walk amongst them and the start of the Navajo trail was amazing, it made us all feel as though we were in an Indiana Jones movie! We started this walk from Sunset point and took the right hand direction of the Navajo trail, we found this was the best was to go.The Queens Garden walk was also nice, be were still blown away by the previous days walk.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is without question the best thing I have ever seen! You cannot miss Bryce on your trip to Utah. I managed to drive in from Salt Lake one morning (which was about 4 hours). I had every intention on only doing the Navajo/Queen's Garden Loop, but both those trails were pretty heavily occupied. I ended up hiking from Inspiration Point on the Rim trail down to Navajo loop and did the 3 mile trek around Peek-a-Boo loop then up through the Queen's Garden trail to Sunrise Point. I felt that given the limited amount of time that I had, I got a very good taste of hiking through the Hoodoos and saw most of what I wanted to see. The park estimates that hike at 6 hours, but if you're relatively fit 4-4.5 hours with a stop for lunch would do it. Spare the extra couple hours for Peek-a-Boo loop if you can. It was 100% worth it. I liked that it was several degrees cooler there because the elevation is slightly higher. That being said, the weather moves extremely fast and patterns can change quick so pack yourself a decent rain coat. Don't skimp on bringing an extra bottle of water because there is nowhere to refill when you're on the trails. They do have the refill stations at the visitor info lodge and general store but that's really it.Most importantly, enjoy the magnificent spires! The view of a lifetime!

There are all kinds of trails to hike for all kinds of skills and abilities. If you are not interested in hiking you can take the main road to the end. There are multiple places to stop on the road. You can take in the awesome views from the road. They have a free shuttle available, but you do not have to ride it. There is a visitors center, a lodge, and camping. It is to my understanding you need a reservation to eat dinner at the lodge restaurant. The temperature is not as bad here as some of the other national parks. If you do not want to deal with lots of people I suggest starting early. Take lots of water. If it is raining, still take your hike. Just expect to have caked on clay to your shoes.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Oh my goodness, WHERE to start??! Bryce Canyon has been on my bucket list for many, many years... finally made it here this summer on our ""Grand Loop"" vacation and the only thing I wish is that I had way more time to spend at this National Park. It was that amazing. (so it remains on my bucket list to go back). We spent a full day here and it just wasn't enough... we were able to do the entire Scenic Drive and stop at nearly every viewpoint... all of them were beautiful and offered differing perspectives. That drive takes at least a couple of hours (if you stop at all/most of the viewpoints)... but worth it. TIP: Drive all the way to the END of the Scenic Drive and then stop at the viewpoints on the way BACK (all of them are on your right-hand-side). As for our favorite parts... the hiking. This is where I wanted more time (which means if you like to hike, then plan on staying a day or two (or longer), so you can get more of that in. There are lots of trails and being able to hike down inside the canyon and the hoodoos was beyond cool... my head was swiveling all around trying to take everything in... since we just had several hours (and wanted to also do the Scenic Drive), we did the Queens Garden Trail and hooked up with the Navajo Loop Trail. It was one of the best hikes we've ever done (not long, but absolutely beautiful). It was warm (be sure to pack enough water) and take your time so you can soak as much of this amazing place in as you can... the hikes down into the canyon (and then BACK UP) can entail lots of switchbacks and elevation changes, but if you can physically do them, they are breathtaking. The main amphitheater is beyond amazing. I would LOVE to see it at both sunrise and sunset... another reason why Bryce National Park remains on my bucket list...

There are many trails to choose from to hike down amongst the hoodoos or you can just take an easy stroll along the rim trail and take in the views.

There were also rangers walking around answering questions and telling stories to amuse the people waiting to use the telescopes. The rangers were enthusiastic and knowledgeable.

Sneakers/runners will give you problems. The loop is about 2-1/2 miles (6K) and takes about 2 hours depending on photo stops (there will be many). The trail is hard packed red clay, I cannot imagine this trail would be open in wet weather. Our experience was 10/10.","July 4, 2016",Hiking paradise,8,"Knoxville, Tennessee",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,This was our first time at Bryce and we enjoyed every minute of it. Went on a few hikes and drove to all the outlooks. The food in the town was a bit lacking. I suggest driving a few mile down the road to find other food. There is a restaurant not too far from Bryce that we ate breakfast at that was excellent.

We drove to the end of the road into the park, then made our way back to the entrance stopping at the 18 or so view spots along the way, since the spots are on the left side when going INTO the park, but on the RIGHT when leaving - makes stopping and getting back on the road easier.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Great two days at Bryce. We stayed in nearby Tropic (see separate review of Bryce Pioneer Village). We hiked around the rim and did the Navajo and Peekaboo trail. Tried to watch sunrise at Bryce Point - but found out t is closed for renovations/trail maintenance. We watched a cloudy sunrise from Inspiration Point (excellent viewing point also). Lodge has a great dining room for lunch (burgers, salads, BLTs, Club sandwiches all for around $10-12 and a hot and cold buffet for $14.15. The General store has self-serve soft serve cones for $1.95 (as much as you can safely put on the cone). We had two full days there. You hike down into the canyon using multiple switchbacks - the great views are from the rim so those who do not want/can't hike can still enjoy Bryce. There are multiple trails but you can see everything you would want to see in 1.5 to 2 days. We also visited Mossy Caves - a short hike from Highway 12 (build in 45 minutes if you have it available). Shuttle system is fine - but optional (unlike Zion where it is the only travel mode during most of the year). We shuttled one day (no problem) and drove into the lodge one day (and had minimal problems locating parking). Great visit for young and old to see a truly amazing USA National Treasure!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"When touring Utah you must include Bryce Canyon as one of your stops. When you first see the Hoodoos that make up the main reason that Bryce is a park, you will be amazed. The colors are marvelous and it is hard to believe that the ground could have eroded in such a way. The rim road takes you to the many amphitheaters where the ground has been transformed over the eons by rain, snow, ice and wind. Each amphitheater is different and most have trails that take you down into the forests of spires you see before you when standing on the rim. If walking is not your thing, then, perhaps you would want to take a tour by horseback. Either way, it is an amazing place to be. There is a huge tourist facility outside the park where you can stay and find activities, but you must drive into the park each day. The best option is to make reservations to stay inside the park. You can camp in the campground. The lodge has a few rooms. There are many individual cabins. Finally there are motel style rooms. All of these are located just a short walk from the rim. The lodge also has a gift shop and a wonderful dining room. If you want to stay inside the park, then make your reservations well in advance of your arrival. The summer is hot so you may want to plan your stay around the cooler months. We stayed a couple of days and when we left we felt we could have added a third day, be a little less hurried and experienced a bit more of the park. This is a wonderful place to visit so don't miss it.","July 4, 2016",Amazing place to visit,773,"Westminster, Colorado",5

I would suggest a shuttle though as parking is limited at the drop off points. The views were spectacular, and most places wheel-chair accessible. I wish I could have gone hiking.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is like something from another planet. Bryce has been described as a city of chimneys when you look down from the rim, and that seems an apt description of the 'HooDoos'. The view, not just of this amphitheatre but across the valley as a whole is stunning. It is nice to walk around the rim to get a different perspective of the canyon. Sunrise and sunset offer a wonderful colour change across the canyon, when the rocks seem to change from reds, pinks and oranges.The walks here are not as strenuous as other parks, with well made paths across almost all walks, great for less serious hikers. That said, there is still a fairly steep descent and climb back up to the rim after your walk. The Navajo Loop is the most popular,busiest walk, as it is relatively quick for short stay tourists, but is impressive nonetheless. The Peekaboo trail is a great walk if you have a few hours to spare, generating some excellent views along the way. Although the walks are not too taxing, the heat can be a problem. You might want to start early, or late, to avoid midday heat, and this will also help ensure you find a parking space in the park. There is a shuttle from the town outside the park otherwise.

My wife wasn't keen but I insisted, and she was glad I did as it turned out to be one her top 3 places of our 4 week trip.The view points around the rim provide a range of different perspectives, varying formations and expansive views. They tend to be the views you see on the photos and it is certainly worth visiting, as photos don't do it justice. But in our opinion and experience you need to walk in the canyon.We were up early to catch the sunrise and then walked from Sunset Point, down the Navajo Trail, along the Peekaboo trail and up to Bryce Point. We only saw a couple of people until we were heading up the final switchbacks to Bryce point. We caught the bus back to Inspiration Point and then walked the rim back to the car park at Sunset point.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"1. Spectacular scenery with the largest formations of spirals of natural rock columns in the world, formed by wind and water erosion over the centuries. 2. 160 miles from the Grand Canyon North Rim, 260 miles from Salt Lake City, 271 miles from Las Vegas, 300 miles from the Grand Canyon South Rim, 422 miles from Phoenix, and 522 miles from Los Angeles. 3. We had driven 83 miles from Zion National Park, through the long Carmel-Zion tunnel, going from the high desert areas to the alpine areas, along narrow winding mountain roads, during the last week in April. Temperatures dropped from the high 70s to the low 50s, with long columns of cars lined up waiting on the other side of the one way tunnel.4. The tourist town Bryce, with several restaurants and hotels, is 2 miles from the park. We stayed at the Best Western Plus Bryce Canyon Grand Hotel, an exceptional modern hotel. 5. Bryce Canyon Lodge is the only hotel in the park, with it's own restaurant, 6 miles from town, and a short walk from the top attraction : the amphitheater containing the Navajo trail between Sunrise Point and Sunset Point. It is double the price of hotels in Bryce, at $240+, and lacks such modern amenities as wifi.6. A free shuttle bus runs from downtown Bryce down the 20 mile main paved road in park, but riders must buy Park tickets in town, $30 per family, good for 7 days. Seniors 62+, like myself, get in free with a $10 National Park lifetime pass -hey we only have so many good years left! 6. We drive through the entry station showing our lifetime pass, drive past the Visitor's center nearby, and through the forests at 8000 feet altitude. Past Sunrise Point, the Lodge, and onto Sunset Point.7. Recommended that one hike the Navajo trail in a clock wise direction, as it is easier to go up the cross traverse trails near Sunset Point, than the steep incline to Sunrise Point. 8. Recommended to start the Navajo trail at Sunrise Point with ample parking and restrooms.9. Large paved parking lot and restrooms with flush toilets here, with a short paved walk to Sunset Point. 10. At Sunset Point, we see Bryce amphitheater - a sunken area 2 miles across, with hundreds of spirals of stone columns, hoodoos, formed by wind and water, against the orange cliffs on three sides.11. We hike down the cross traverse dirt pathway along the Navajo trail into the amphitheater We hike past Thor's Hammer, a giant hoodoo, shaped like a hammer, with a large stone balancing precariously on a spiral of rock. 12. Trail leads to the bottom of the canyon, with trees and a few natural rock bridges. Signs warn visitors to stay off the bridges, due to their instability. 13. Hundreds of hoodoos everywhere, said by Indians to be the reincarnations of the dead, who displeased the almighty.14. The trail leads to the Queen's Garden Trail, and the Queen Victoria statue of rock, resembling the Queen sitting on her throne.15. 3 hours of hiking, the last going up 521 feet to Sunrise Point, in cold windy conditions, with snow flurries, this last week of April. Against a magnificent background of the largest concentration of spiral stone columns in the world. 16. A the top of the plateau, we walk along the paved rim trail back to Sunset Point, and our parked lot. 17. Recommended that one hike the Navajo trail in a clock wise direction, as it is easier to go up the cross traverse trails near Sunset Point, than the steep incline to Sunrise Point. 18. The paved rim trail goes for 4 miles, starting at Fairyland Point, 2.5 miles to Sunrise Point, along the Bryce Amphitheater, past Sunset Point, Inspiration Point, and Bryce Point, these last 4 overlooking the amphitheater, all reachable by vehicle on the main paved Park road. 19. The main road goes for 20 miles with bus shuttle stops at Fairyland Point, Sunrise Point, Sunset point, Inspiration Point, and Bryce Point.20. Gate past Inspiration Point closed during winter storms. Stops at Swamp Canyon, Whiteman bench, Farview Point (bathrooms), Natural Bridge, Agua Canyon, Ponderosa Canyon, Black Birch Canyon, and 9115 foot elevation Rainbow Point. 21. We drove past Inspiration Point, but turned back due to poor visibility with falling snow this last week of April.22. After May 1, the shuttles run on a full schedule, as the parking lots at all these sites fill up early in the morning.23. A sight to remember: snow flurries falling with towering hoodoos looming in the background.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"On a 24 day motorcycle camping trip with another retired military friend and his son, we visited several National Parks. All were beautiful in their own way and with the exception of Bryce, the staff in each park has been extremely helpful. Our first impression of Bryce NP was the lady taking money at the front gate who either hated her job or just people in general. She managed to scold all three of us for imagined infractions. This bad taste was improved when we actually got the awesome view of the canyon. But while we were there, two wounded warriors, missing limbs, parked their motorcycle in what was not a parking spot but was out of the way and allowed them to get closer to the view. They were ticketed. As far as I'm concerned, the staff at our parks should make an effort to assist injured vets, not harass them. The staff at Mesa Verde NP, Zion NP, Death Valley NP, Lassen NP, Crater Lake NP, Devil's Tower NP, Mount Rushmore NP, Redwoods NP, and the Badlands NP were all friendly, informative and made us feel welcome.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce has always been my favorite. Besides its unique and spectacular formations, it has trails that run from very easy rim walks to reasonably hard trails all the way from the rim to the bottom, and back up a different way. There are also several mule and horseback rides into the canyon, of varying lengths. And the Lodge has a nice restaurant and is located right on the rim for easy access. Well worth a side trip from wherever else you might be going in the area.","June 27, 2016",Bryce has always been my favorite national park,68,"Silverthorne, Colorado",5

Once in the park, plan on driving to the end (Rainbow Point, 18 miles from the entrance) and then working your way back stopping at the various overlook areas. Entry fee was $30.00 for the car. Not sure if larger vehicles are charged more. Not all of the pull offs have spaces which accommodate larger (RV) vehicles. We planned on eating a picnic lunch at Rainbow, but were not able to locate a table (could have been our fault) and ended up finding one in the middle of one of the larger pull offs -- not the secluded, in the woods, picnic that we had hoped for.","June 26, 2016","Out of the way, but very worthwhile.",9,"Akron, Ohio",5

Each stop was beautiful, and they got better and better as we drove. Inspiration Point and Sunrise Point were just that. My favorites and magnificent in their beauty. Who knew a hoodoo could be so awesome? Nature is amazing and this park is a must if you are in the area. We made a short day trip out of it from Zion National Park. We had our puppy with us and other dogs were out and about at each stop. Even with all the people there, we found parking at each stop and great photo ops.

It is worth it even for 1-2 hours, you don´t need to take the shuttle. It is easy to use your own car and the viewpoints are mostly signposted. You will need to walk a bit though for the best ones.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon National Park is focused on the “amphitheater” of eroded stone layers that produce interesting formations, such as “fins” and “hoodoos.” Visitors can see the amphitheater from several locations, but they are just different vantage points to see the same thing. Visitors can also walk among the hoodoos. Those who do so should go prepared for significant hiking in desert conditions.Those interested in a quicker, less crowded, cheaper version of the experience can get almost as much by driving along Highway 12 from its intersection with Highway 89 to the village of Tropic. Red Canyon, part of the U.S. Forest Service system, has a visitor center and campground. Views along the drive are similar to those within the National Park.Those interested in the main features of the National Park will be well serviced by parking outside the Park in the designated shuttle lot in Bryce City. The shuttle will drop visitors off at the main viewing points near the front of the park. Although the shuttle is free, “tickets” for admission to the park must be purchased before boarding the shuttle.The only significant geological feature that cannot be conveniently reached via the shuttle is the “natural bridge,” which would be called an arch if it were located in Arches National Park. If you’ve been to Arches, this one is not worth the extra time and distance.","June 24, 2016",Erosion at its best?,164,"Bakersfield, California",4

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon although there are many beautiful spots it is not one of my favorite parks I was very disappointed with how crowded and tacky touristy they made it as you drive into the park. The rocks and overlooks are beautiful but you can actually see some of that without having to drive into the park - there is one road in one road out, many tour buses and a lot of people. If in the area I would say it is worth the trip through the park because still it is one of our beauty's but would spend time at other National parks or sights in the area if you are there during the busy summer season. I would like to see it in the winter or fall when there are not a lot of folks around I would think it could be a very different park then. Also beware for older folks or people with breathing issues you climb up to 9100 ft above sea level as you go through the park and to the end. You do have to park and get out to really see the formations and the drive through is nothing special vs again other parks in the area.","June 24, 2016",A bit overcrowded,38,new haven connecticut,3

Bryce Canyon National Park,Best way to hike Bryce canyon. Simple directions are park your car in the main parking lot face the canyon and start walking to your right side. The trail will start off at the awesome Wall Street Canyon massive walls surround you as you take the switch backs down into the canyon floor it narrows down to a small point then opens to this beautiful valley full of the hoodoos. Make sure you have your map how far you want to go and start hiking I suggest you keep to the right and head up the right side of the valley then back down to the center if you take this direction you come back to the center which allows you to head back up and out through Wall Street again if your tired if your ready for more head off to see the queen then up and out ending at the opposite side of the parking lot you stated in.Several loops available depending on your time available and indurance level Bring extra water sunscreen and sunglasses for everybody.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We hiked the Hoodoos and found them amazing and interesting. Initially, when reading and looking at pictures of different hikes this place wasn't high on my list but my mind was quickly changed after my first peak at what we were to experience. The shapes, color, size and vastness of the Hoodoos is something neither pictures nor words can describe, similar to seeing the Grad Canyon up close. Pictures don't do either justice. There's more than one way to do the hike. We approached the overlook at the top and took the path down to our left as you look out over the Hoodoos. It's a step incline down so that part is an easier hike. But the way out is up so that maybe difficult for tired children or ones that wouldn't want to climb the path up. I believe there's an easier way in and out for young families or those not able to do the steep incline up. You'll miss being down in the Hoodoos if you do that hike but at least you'll be able to see some of it. We spent about 3 hours to do the complete hike but stopped many time to enjoy the views and take pictures. We stayed at Ruby's Best western which was very expensive. We booked late and overpaid I am sure. The hotel is clean with comfortable beds and clean bathrooms. Many of the rooms (could be as many as half of the hotel ) look into an extremely dumpy back area of the hotel. Definitely try to get room that doesn't look out at this unless you're getting a deal.","June 19, 2016",Amazing hikes,2,"Newport Beach, CA",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Technically not a canyon but an eroding plateau, this park is one of the smaller of the national parks but it is stunning. Park your car at the shuttle station, pay $15, and get on the shuttle to take you into the park. Make sure you go to Observation Point, which was the furthest the shuttle was going when I was there (Bryce Point was closed) and then walk back to Sunrise Point and do the Navajo Loop to the Queen's Gardens Trail. Start the Navajo loop counterclockwise and not clockwise as the brochure recommends. This will bring you first to Wall Street (a slot canyon) after descending sharp switchbacks. After that follow the directions of Navajo loop and continue until you see signs for Queens Garden trail. This will take you to Sunset Point where you can get the shuttle to the lodge. I highly recommend signing up for the free bus tour to Rainbow point. It leaves twice a day 9 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. and can pick you up at the visitor's center. It's 3 hours or so and if Spike is your guide, you are in for a treat. On the way back from Rainbow Point you stop at other points of interest to see the hoodoos named after things people about 100 years ago thought the rocks resembled (like the hunter and the rabbit).

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Words can't really describe how amazing Bryce Canyon is. I'm not sure I will review each place we went to in Bryce, but will put some general thoughts here: basically Bryce is: 1) The most amazing of the nature locations we visited in the US (IMO), 2) Doesn't require special preparation and doesn't require hiking extensively to see the best parts, 3) Less crowded than many major US national parks.Basically when planning our trip, we weren't sure we wanted to go to Bryce, because it was relatively far from the other nature locations we wanted (Zion, Grand Canyon and places around Page, AZ), and because there was no place to stay nearby (this was actually not a big deal in retrospect, but you should keep it in mind when planning—best to plan more than half a year in advance to get the most choice).In the end though we had enough time to make the detour (stayed at Panguitch), and it was (for me at least) the greatest pleasant surprise of the trip by far! The canyon is beautiful and photogenic, and it's easy to see a lot of good spots in a short period of time. Almost every picture you take here will be amazing. The place is truly like nothing else I have ever seen. In my honest opinion, if your time is limited in Southwestern USA, you should prioritize Bryce over Zion and Grand Canyon (although of course, all three are great).","June 18, 2016",Phenomenal,165,"Petah Tiqwa, Israel",5

We parked at the lodge in the visitor parking area and walked the navajo Loop Trail that links onto the Queens Garden trail. The loop we made makes it way essentially from Sunset Point and finishes at Sunrise Point. The hoodoos and rock formations here are extraordinary and no where on earth have I seen such a conglomeration of such incredible rocks.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Once you look past all of the tourist crap, and the noisy, annoying tourists, you'll enjoy one of our greatest, most beautiful national parks. I even put this park above the Grand Canyon, as it is more accessible. That accessibility is one of the things that makes it a tourist haven, but if you hike early, you can beat the crowds and really enjoy the beauty of the park. My son and I did the main loop hike at 5:30 in the morning, and ran into only one couple about halfway through our hike. Otherwise, we heard only bugs and birds, and relished the sights. It's like nature's cathedral, with all of the incredible sandstone formations. Simply beautiful.I would like to add one word for tourists. Please, leave the annoying selfie-sticks at home and simply enjoy the beauty of this place. Don't be noisy. Don't be rude. Don't feel like you have to do acrobatics in your photos.

In hindsight, it was not the better choice for us since the shuttle only goes through half the park and we would have enjoyed seeing more.We are not hikers, but walked the rim trail from Inspiration Point to Sunset Point - which was beautiful, but a bit too much for my traveling companion (inclines at high altitude). Some other older folks struggled a bit too, but most people skipped along. (Note that there aren't railings to prevent smaller children from the cliff-like drops)TIPS: Bring plenty of water, sunscreen, hat and a snack.

Bryce Canyon National Park,I would encourage everyone to visit Bryce National Park. We toured all five of the southern Utah national parks and this one was the favorite of everyone in the family. We stayed at a RV park just outside the national park . The rim walk in Bryce National park between Sunrise and Sunset was incredible. It is beautiful at Sunset. The views of the Hoodoos were excellent. The hike to do is the Queens/ Navajo loop. It is a moderately difficult hike. We started at the sunrise point but if I had to do it again I would start at the sunset point. The walk up would be easier in this direction. Waking among the hoodoos was fantastic and yielded wonderful pictures. The hike takes about 2 hours. There is a free shuttle in the park that stops at many of the popular lookouts. There is another road that goes down to rainbow point which has many other viewpoints. The shuttle does not go down this road. If you want to see this section of the park I would recommend taking your own vehicle into the park.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"One of the best parks I've been to I years and I've seen the top 8-10 parks in USA. The elevation gives the park nice cool weather in the summer when the rest of the area is at 95F. The hoodoos at inspiration point are really beautiful. The rocks have a lot of character and so many colors in different lighting. All the points are accessible by shuttle, car and you have plenty of trail options. The Navajo trail and queens garden trail are my favorite. They can be combined for a 2.2 mile amazing experience and see the hoodoos up close. The best part is the dark night sky at Bryce Canyon. A unique geological landscape and the elevation make great star gazing conditions. It's not advertised much but is a lifetime experience at Bryce Canyon. You can really see 7500+ stars on a clear night, you won't believe your eyes. You can actually see colors on planets with naked eyes. They also have an astronomy festival in first week of June where they bring lots of huge telescopes and manage the whole event in the night.

The weirdest part for me is driving into Bryce, you are actually going through Dixie National Forest - this incredibly unusual canyon is in the middle of a forest - it's so interesting that the forest just opens up to this crazy terrain.As a National Park, Bryce is much smaller than some of the other big contenders - I gave myself a day and a half to explore more of the park but you can plan to spend one day and still get the experience. I would recommend giving yourself time to drive to some of the most popular viewpoints to see the canyon from above - and then give yourself time to do at least one trail that goes down into the canyon so you can experience the hoodoos towering above you and see the super tall trees from the bottom.","June 6, 2016","Amazing Environment, Smaller National Park",52,"Austin, Texas",4

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Maybe it's because so many people say that Bryce Canyon is the best of all of the National Parks in Utah, so expectations are higher, but after visiting Arches, Canyonlands and Zion we found Bryce to be a big disappointment. Whilst the first sight of the hoodoos was impressive, most of the views afterwards just seemed to be ""same hoodoos, slightly different angle"".There were a couple of other reasons for the low rating:- Access to Sunrise Point was by bus and coach tours only because of construction, and the buses were not very frequent, however we did see a number of cars ignoring the ""do not access"" notices. This was not mentioned on the website the day before we visited.- At Bryce Point there was a coach load of Germans who were screaming / shouting at each other, and some of them pushed an older lady who was just trying to take a photo- The staff in the gift shop were rude","June 5, 2016",Disappointing,306,"Halifax, Canada",2

Bryce Canyon National Park,"The park itself is amazing but make sure you get information about the hikes you want to take, etc. from the ranger and not the international interns. They are twenty somethings who lack the experience to reliably recommend a family outing. We went to the visitors center two days in a row for two different pieces of information. On both occasions we were misguided. The first day we wanted to find out if there were places to grab a late lunch in the park. We had driven from Zion and wanted eat at Bryce and arrived at the park hungry. The interns were not aware that the main restaurant had finished serving lunch and the second had no options for people with celiac. Needless to say it was a bummer since we would have made other plans. The second day we approached the info desk with questions regarding a hike that would be suitable for 16, 12 and 9 y.o. hikers. They told us to take Navajo Loop to Peekaboo Loop and out the Queens Trail. She described the Queens trail as a simple hike out. Be prepared- after Peekaboo the Queens Trail is a lot for younger, less experienced hikers. Make sure you pack extra water for the last leg!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Three 55+ year old couples really enjoyed this park. Beautiful and colorful rock formations make this a very unique national park. The hoodoos (these rock formations) are mesmerizing with their various shapes reminding you of everything from your pet, to a line of American Indians, to a column of soldiers or a row of gargoyles. We followed (and advise) the recommendation of our hosts at Bullberry B&B in Tropic, who suggested we bypass everything to drive to the south end of the park drive, hike the rim at the south end, then stop at all the viewpoints on the way back, which will all be on your right hand side. We then did a great 3.2 mile hike starting at Sunset Point and hiking counterclockwise to Sunrise Point. Most people take this hike clockwise, but the hike appears much more enjoyable to hike as suggested. If wanting to view the sunset on the hoodoos, I recommend the top level of Inspiration Point well in advance of sunset since the sun sets away from the hoodoos and they will be in shadows well before the sun gets down to the horizon. This is a must see national park!","June 3, 2016",Beautiful must visit national park,23,"Thayer, Missouri",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bring water and good walking or hiking shoes for this trek. We started at inspiration point and did the Navajo trail which takes you down to the bottom of the hoodoos to get a view up. We went down the 800 foot decline which is a bunch of switchbacks on a dusty trail. We saw so many people huffing and puffing to get back up, so I asked someone if you had to come back up. It is a loop trail and he advised taking the loop because the ascent is on 450 feet. I barely made it back up as I was not used to the altitude. Every bit of my water was gone too.This trail is not for small children unless you intend on carrying them back to the top. Nor should you wear sandals. We saw people with both.The views from above are incredible, from the bottom not as magnificent, but still a must see.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"If you like the desert, open spaces, gaping chasms and wild rock formations, you will love Bryce Canyon. Do you remember how you felt when you first walked up to the Grand Canyon? Bryce is the same. Absolutely unique rock formations that hang in the air. It beggars belief how some of the monoliths here have not snapped off in the often blustery conditions. The Queen's Garden and Navajo Loop are the best known walks, and a must, but we also did the Rim Walk/Fairyland Loop/Tower Bridge circuit (approx 13kms) early in the morning when no one was around. Bit of a hike, but absolutely stunning. For those who can't get around too easily, as is the case with the Grand Canyon, the Rim walk is quite long and most of the sections can be traversed easily with few rises/falls. It would also suit wheelchair access, and the shops/visitor centre and showers are all wheelchair friendly. We spent two days in the campgrounds which are predominantly first come, first served. So get in early to get a spot. The North Campground is great because it's close to the walks and shops. Even in the off season there are plenty of visitors, and all the spots fill up pretty quickly. You have to buy your firewood, you can't pick up any wood from the ground. There are fresh water taps everywhere and a smattering of toilets, but no showers. If you want a shower, you have to go to the General Store and its $2 for 8 minutes. About half a dozen showers and the water is nice and hot. Definitely try and get to the sunrise and sunset points, or one of the viewing points along the rim to see the light show. Oh and if you are doing a National Park crawl, make sure you get the Annual Pass for $80, it's approx $30 for entry at most National Parks, so it pays off pretty quickly.","June 2, 2016",The Bryce is Right,93,"Gerroa, Australia",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon National Park gives a FREE tour twice a day on a very comfortable bus. It lasts almost four hours and covers 40 miles roundtrip. You'll need to make a reservation through the Visitors’ Center, either in person or by calling ahead of time. The excursion first took us non-stop to the far end of the canyon. On the return loop we made multiple stops at many of the park's scenic lookouts. We had to exit the bus at these places in order to enjoy the spectacular vistas and learn about points of interest in the distant horizon, as well close-up plants, trees and wildlife. Spike Brown was our excellent driver and guide. All during the tour, he entertained us with his personal history as well as interesting facts about the canyon. We learned the inside scoop, like the best viewpoints for sunset and sunrise. Ask a question of Spike, and learn even more based on his own experience, knowledge and love of the area. Our advice is to make your reservations ahead of time, and for the beginning of your stay, in order to get the most from your Bryce experience.

We also dragged out of bed and watched the sunrise from Inspiration Point, which I would also urge everyone to do.

The descent is fairly steep and the path a looser gravel. But to see the hoodoos close up is a thrill. When you get to ""queen Victoria"" you have to turn around and go back up the same way.

We saw buses with tourists, but they only stopped at the viewpoints, they don't hike. Only about 10% of the people hike the trails. If you pick a harder, longer hike like Fairyland or Peek-a-boo, you won't encounter many people. The park shuttle buses make everything easy to access if you want to park and leave your car. There is a general store for water and food and the Lodge has a nice gift store.If you want to drive the scenic road and sight-see, wait until about 4:00pm and the tourist buses clear out. We did this on a Friday afternoon in May and saw about 15 people or less at all the viewpoints.","May 31, 2016",Absolutely amazing!,65,"Raleigh, North Carolina",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"You run out of adjectives to describe Bryce Canyon. The red rock is just mind blowing and the wind and water erosion have created such amazing structures, known as hoodoos. You can visit all the sites in he north, close to the visitor centre, by shuttle bus or by car - but parking is difficult. To get to the far south (24 miles round trip) I recommend you book a seat on the 3-hour but trip with guided commentary. The guide will stop at multiple sites for photographs but he is very knowledgeable and will point out things you would otherwise miss for example the oldest tree in the park or the north rim of the Grand Canyon.Sunrise is the time for photographs not sunset - it's facing the wrong way. Do take a walk into the canyon e.g. the queen's garden. the paths are very safe and not steep and it is an amazing site to look up at the hoodoos rather than down on them.This is probably the best of Utah's parks and, in summer, the most visited. Its reputation is well justified though!","May 31, 2016",Sensational,23,"Pinner, United Kingdom",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is a lot smaller than Zion and weather is a lot cooler. We decided to hike the peek-a-boo trail but when we learned of the much recommended canyon rides, we decided towards the horseback tour instead after days of hiking at Zion. Bryce offers way different sceneries and rock formations than any other national parks/canyons in southern UT ( we've been to zion, arches, capitol reef, red canyon). The hoodoos make Bryce stand out. Most of the dirt hiking trails are also shared with horses. Horses get the right of way, do not attempt to hike off trail when horses are passing by as this will startle the pack and cause chaos. An extra tip, if you're planning to drive north to Capitol Reef or to Arches NP, or vice versa, take the scenic drive of Route 12, I learned from the locals it's the second best scenic route in the world... second to New Zealand.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We had looked at many pictures of the park before we got there. When we looked at the park's map, we thought it was small and could pass thru everything in half a day. We were wrong as more we looked around more things we wanted to see. The Rainbow Point had an elevation of 9000+ feet and offered a great view of the part of the canyon. The sunset view was excellent and so was the sunrise. It was a great place to stare at the stars at night as the place was almost free of light pollution at that remote and high elevation.","May 30, 2016",A wonderful park to visit,93,"Hamilton, New Jersey",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,The place is simply stunning. The authorities would like you to use the shuttle busses to get around but beware.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"You can drive, take short walks and look , take medium or long trails but wherever you go you just breathe in the majesty of this park. The popular points (Inspiration and Sunset) are outstanding, we took the Swamp Canyon/ Sheep Creek trail which was 4 miles and took 2.5 hours. The ascent was just right but harder than we had anticipated I think because of the high altitude (we are in our 60's) - it was rated ""moderate"". This park is a ""must see"".","May 30, 2016",Reputation Deserved,45,,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Loved it! The weather couldn't be perfect. The shuttle system is cool so you don't have to bring your car up to the different view points. The hike doing the sunset point should be on the list. There is no side bars to hold on to and the road is halfway done so it could get slippery. Definitely wear sneakers or non-slip shoes no matter what the temperature is outside. The key is to sit down on one of the benches and look at the view... taking it all in..forget about work and worries..relax your mind. You could spend a day there or a week. We wish we could have spent 2 full days instead of 1. Entrance fee. So the price to get in is $30 for a week. Well worth it if you plan to stay there for a week or at least more than a day. Zion also charges the same. To get the money's worth, get an annual pass which is for the entire year (the day you pay + 365 days) and you can visit any national parks in US for $80. Not bad at all!!! Lodging. You could spend hours researching where to stay. If you plan on being outside most of the day then a good quality motel close to Bryce will do. We stayed at Mountain Ridge motel and it was more than I expected out of a motel. Glad we chose that and if we ever have to visit Bryce again, we will definitely stay here. There is a Galaxy diner close by and they have nice breakfast. Hydrate. Bring a water bottle and fill it near the shuttle stops. Pictures. You want memories. But you want to also enjoy at the same time. Bring compact camera if possible. Cellphone cameras have good resolution and comeout as good. Big camera with all the gear really tires you out and you don't enjoy as could have otherwise.Visitor center. Don't miss the free half hr documentary on Bryce canyon. The sit down theater is located inside the visitor center next to gift shop. You could watch it the first thing before you start your day or at the end when you are very tired and a nice sit down movie will get your mind going and start appreciating of what you just saw.The NPS have really outdone themselves. I truly appreciate the way they have preserved natural beauty. Everyone working at Bryce canyon were awesome, guided us and really made us feel welcome. Wish we can come back here again and spend more than a day.","May 30, 2016",Breathtaking views!! ,29,"Dallas, Texas",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,Visited on Memorial Day weekend but got there early (about 8:30) and beat the crowds. Drove all the way to the end. Some views off in the distance during the 15 mile drive and surprised at all the burnt areas. On the way back stopped at each viewing point and was amazed at the views. By the time I got to Sunset they had closed off the access to it because of lack of parking for the crowd. At that point we went on to the lodge and found parking there and had short hikes along the rim to sunset and sunrise points. We also did the walk down the Queen trail the rock formations (many called hoodoos)'were awesome. This is truly an unique experience.,"May 29, 2016",Awesome,344,"Knoxville, Tennessee",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce is drop-dead gorgeous and awe-inspiring. The view from the canyon rim is hard to dramatic, comparable in my opinion to the south rim of Grand Canyon. However, unlike GC, you can easily walk among Bryce's hoodoos and visit the canyon floor without any great effort through short hikes that take you from the rim to the floor and back. .You can see the major sights in a day or two, but you should not miss Bryce in a trip to Utah. Really the main rationale for staying overnight at Bryce is if you want to catch sunrise or sunset over the canyon, which is reason enough to stay in the park instead of in the town of Bryce. The best way to experience the park is to first drive to the southern end of the park road, stop by all the numbered overlooks (the Natural Bridge was my favorite), which can be done in an hour or two. Parking at each spot is limited, so early in the day is less crowded than later. Then finish up exploring the Bryce amphitheater, which is where most of the hoodoos are, nearer the park entrance. At minimum, walk the paved Rim Trail that connects overlooks like Sunrise, Sunset, and Inspiration Points. (Bryce Point is closed for construction.) Then take one or more hikes into the canyon in the remaining time. As an inexpert 60-something hiker with some breathing issues due to the altitude, I found that a combination of the Queens Garden (out) and Navajo Trail (back) captured the essence of the canyon in a doable way. Most trails are family-friendly, although since the trails hug the canyon walls you have to keep an eye on your kids and not let them run ahead. It takes between 1-2 hours, depending upon how much you stop and look around and take pics. Be warned that the Navajo Trail is pretty steep, with a series of cutbacks that take you back up to the rim of the canyon, so you may just need to take your time or take the Queen's Garden trail back since it is a more gradual slope though longer. It was fairly busy even in the morning in mid-May so if you can get there early to hike, you will beat the crowds and some of the heat. There is little or no shade on the trails, so bring sunscreen, a brimmed hat, and plenty of water. We stayed in the park over two nights in part because of our itinerary, and in part because we wanted to be sure to catch the sunrise and sunset, as well as to see the very dark and starry night sky, which Bryce is well known for.The lodge gives out sunrise and sunset times, which in mid May were close to 6:15am and 8:15pm respectively. They advise you to get to your vantage point a half hour beforehand to take advantage of the changing light conditions. You will also have time then to secure a viewing spot againt the railing. At Sunrise Point, try to get a spot facing south (to the right), since the first light will hit the hoodoos there. Unfortunately, there were clouds on the horizon when we were there so we didn't see anything but an overall lightening of the sky at sunrise. If it is cloudy, don't bother waking up at 5am! There were more people at sunset than sunrise but still plenty of bodies, which is why it's good to get there early enough to get a viewing spot along the railing. Be sure to bring your camera. It was cloudy that night as well so we missed the subset and the starry night sky. But we did get to see a small herd of pronghorns out by Paria Point and again the next morning of of the main road!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I have been to Bryce before and had to return. This park is by far the most spectacular Park, it even beats Arches National Park and that is hard to do. The Hoodoos, rock spires are stunning and the light is reflected off them so the park is constantly changing color. You can take a horse back ride down into the park or you can hike on down. Bring water either way and wear hiking boots as the trails can be slippery with sand. Once down in side the park takes on a different personality as you view up verses down. Look at the various hoodoos and see if you can see people in their shapes. If you go to Utah Do not miss Bryce Canyon, I allotted a few days to really see the park I also chose to drive from point to point but you can also take a free shuttle bus to the park. I went in May so I ran the risk of snow fall. And it did snow as we are up 9,000 feet. In the Park is the Bryce Canyon Lodge you can book a room and have lunch there. I will review that later.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"When we arrived in Bryce in early May, it was still snowing, so it slightly altered our plans. On our first afternoon, we drove all the way down to rainbow point (30 min drive) and stopped at all the scenic points along the way until the hail drove us out of the park. Luckily, we had moments of afternoon sun that made the hoodoos glow a beautiful yellow and red. This took us about 2 hours. The next day, we arrived in the morning and walked down the Queen's Garden trail and then came up the twin bridges trail (navajo closes when there is snow). The hike up twin bridges and navajo is pretty steep. It took us approximately 3 hours for the hike. My favorite part of the hike was queen's garden as well as the view from the top of the twin bridges trail, 5 min before arriving at Sunset point. Being up close to these hoodoos is pretty striking. If I didn't have time nor the ability to hike too much, I would just walk down the beginning of the the twin bridges trail and take pictures with the hoodoos in the background.","May 26, 2016",Beautiful!,124,"Montreal, Canada",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,if you are keen on photography then Bryce Canyon is a must stop to capture spectacular sunset and sunrise photos.

We drove the four hours to Bryce Canyon from Las Vegas for a day trip to see the beauty that everyone just raves about. First and foremost, let me just warn you that the pictures of the canyon do not do it justice. The canyon and all the colorful rock formations are incredibly beautiful. During our visit, we did hike on one trail down to the bottom of the canyon from Sunset Point, but while it is easy walking down, it's not easy getting back up (take lots of water with you!). After hiking the trail, something amazing happened: the temperature dropped down to 40-something degrees and became a bit windy and overcast. Shortly after, it started to rain, but it wasn't just any rain - the rain had formed into ice. It was an incredible experience for a Floridian. To visit Bryce Canyon, my recommendation is to take a few pictures, but remember to live in the moment, soak up the beauty of Bryce and remember how it made you feel.

I have to admit that I was nervous about it, having heard how close to the edge the horses and mules get when meeting hikers on the trail.

Bryce Canyon National Park,The most beautiful place. The red Rock formations are just exceptional. All of the outlook spots give you a different perspective on the canyon. Perfect time of year.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Maybe the most, but certainly one of the most beautiful places i have ever seen. Beware of the fact that it is pretty high above sea level wich means there can be snow when you don't expect it. When there is snow you can not walk into the canyon wich is a really big shame because it is a really, really!! nice place to hike. On the other side snow will give the canyon something special aswell.

That's not to say it was not spectacular -- it's just that Capitol Reef up the road and Zion down the street are so much more massive and diverse. Bryce is a bit of a one trick pony with nice views and a few interesting hikes. The good news is that one can enjoy the best that Bryce has to offer by showing up at Sunrise Point at daybreak and then move on to the larger parks.Parking was a challenge at some of the overlooks, and all of the cars, campers and busses brought a lot of people with them.","May 19, 2016",Beautiful -- But Limited,269,"Scottsdale, Arizona",4

I visited on a Tuesday on May 2, so I was able to drive my car and stop at all the overlooks, have a lunch at a picnic table, and park without any trouble. Weekends and the rest of the summer I don't thing you would find a place to stop, park or eat so you have to plan accordingly. Tour buses, shuttles, etc. to get around. Having said all that the views are magnificent and easy to access. That is once you get to the overlooks. The scenery is the only thing there so keep that in mind.

Maybe because so much of it was accessible without hiking and maybe because we fell in love with the hoodos,the beautiful rock formations thru out the park. We especially liked a place called the fairy garden whereon a very short walk you could get up close to them. We were there in the spring but it seemed much less crowed than Zion.

Much of the beauty in Bryce can be accessed through simple overlooks. There are a few hiking trails, but nothing too strenuous. It is not a multiple day park to me because there are not many activities and you can easily see the park within a day.

The scenery here is unlike anything else we saw, and there is great hiking and star-gazing.We were here the nights of Oct 2-3, and you should know that it got down to 34 degrees at night, but daytime temps were in the 60's and very comfortable. At this time of year there was no shuttle, so we drove to lots of overlooks, which we enjoyed very much. There are some overlooks where you just get out of the car and walk to a viewing platform not far away, and there are others where you walk a bit farther, and still others where you can hike if you want to.We came upon cows in the road several times when we were driving to the various viewpoints, so watch out!We stayed in a Western Cabin and loved it. We did not like the lodge restaurant, however, finding it over-priced with so-so food and poor service. We did enjoy Valhalla Pizza, located within the park.I highly recommend a stay at Bryce.

Lots of other overlooks that the bus does not cover. We had snow showers in early May but it just left a beautiful dusting on the hoodoos. Traffic was not bad and we were able to park at all overlooks without a problem. Restaurant in Bryce Lodge was very nice, quick efficient service and nice selection of food. Outside the canyon is a town with restaurants and shops (not that big, but had all the services you would need). We spent three full days and managed to get in all the important stops.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We had to repeat the trail ride we had taken thirty years ago! Back then I had to coax my children to climb aboard an enormous animal and there were tears involved. With new eyes I realized how it must have felt to a seven year old to sit high on her mule and see the deep drop-offs into the canyon. This time just my husband and I were in the saddle. The guides made good selections when they matched us to our steeds. Gentle and trustworthy, the mules do like to walk on the very edge of the path, but when they can see the edge they know where to put their feet. We felt secure as we inched our way down the steep and curved trail. Our guide was conversational, knowledgeable and encouraging. She said 90 per cent of folks who take the trail ride have never ridden a horse or mule before. The animals go through considerable training and are so practiced that I think I could have made it the whole way without giving any guidance at all with the reins.We took the two hour ride, and that was plenty. (There are some physical challenges to sitting astride for the morning.) We learned a lot about the canyon fauna, flora, history and geology as well as a bit about mule breeding and other related topics.

We hiked a few short trails and the bit longer 3.4 mile roundtrip one down to 'natural bridge' and found the scenery even more interesting when seen from within the site. Simply walking the trail along the huge rim of the canyon near the Bryce Canyon Lodge is amazing. Recognize the elevation of the rim and most of the lodge and surrounding areas is around 7,000 feet. It's not to high but we could feel its impact when hiking. Further into the park we found several inches of snow still on the ground in places as the elevation increased to over 9,000 feet at the roads end. I wasn't aware the rare bristlecone cone pine tree could be found here and it was pretty cool to see them growing on two of the trails we walked.

In my opinion it is worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as the Grand Canyon; we walked down into the canyon itself and in between admiring the numerous hoodoos we saw chipmunks! Visitors are advised that the descent into the canyon is quite steep and therefore it is quite difficult to make the ascent back up, and I would certainly echo this; please be careful and make sure that you are able to climb back up the steep paths.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I LOVED how Bryce Canyon’s pine forests deeply contrast with the huge expanses of stunning red rock hoo doo formations... incredible!I'll focus more on the amenities in this review rather than try to describe the park with meaningless superlatives.Unfortunately, we had chosen to visit Bryce during several days of rain and drizzle last September that caused the tragic flash floods further downstream in Zion National Park. But from our tent at the time, all we knew was that we were cold and wet in our tent at the Sunset Campground (we had reserved our site several months prior). On top of that, I became acquainted with a serious bout of food poisoning.Still, Bryce made it easy to be awed even in the worst of conditions. The paved roads lead to plenty of beautiful overlooks (and we stopped at ALL of them), and the park does offer a shuttle system, options for shorter easy walks, and a movie at the Visitor’s Center. I have it on good authority (first person) that the Sunset Campground bathroom was well-maintained and impeccably clean; the hosts were also constantly driving around making sure everyone and everything were in order. We also realized the next day that we were luckier than others: at least 3 tents were submerged in puddles that had formed in their sites, and several soggy sleeping bags were hung out to dry. The real disappointment was that given my condition as well as the slick, dangerous trails leading down into the hoo doos, we couldn’t do half the hikes we had planned. Even the ranger warned us not to.There is real lodging inside the park, but these go very quickly. Although we were due for another night in a tent, the forecast called for more storms. My uncooperative digestive system was a severe hindrance to my full enjoyment of the park, so Expedia came to the rescue and somehow we were able to snag one of the last two rooms at the Best Western.I want to go back to Bryce for the ""other"" experience... and not be under the weather (in more ways than one) this time.","May 2, 2016",Bryce is a BOSS.,264,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5

Sunrise at Bryce, Inspiration, Sunrise or Sunset Points is definitely worth it. I loved the stark geology and the story it had to tell. We hiked down in twice - not too far because of my elderly knees - but the nice thing is, you can go down as far as you want and turn around any time. Or take one of the loops, which so many others seemed to be doing. You've really missed the Bryce experience if you haven't walked among the hoo-doos, close up.

We chose the Queen's Garden trail and she did the entire thing. She really enjoyed it and was only hesitant on the steep descents. It's not often young kids actually appreciate scenery, but as this trail is very castle like it kept her interest. She carried her own water in her camelback and drank it all, the only issue is since it's all natural surroundings there are no facilities once out on the trail. Do plan ahead with pit stops and never forget the water and sun hats. We will plan to visit again to try other trails in the future.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Our favorite park overall on a trip to Grand Canyon Bryce and Zion. Bryce seems smaller more intimate and less crowded than other parks. The scenery is so unusual and different. Elaborate natural sculptures with bright shapes and colors. We did several hikes and found even the moderately rated hikes to be fairly easy. We also did a Mule trip into the canyon which was fun and a big hit with our techie addicted teenagers. The cowboys who take you on the trails are hilarious.

You can see pictures but you have to see it. We hiked along the top of the rim as sunset (from Sunrise to Sunset points) and all of the hoodoos changed colors as the sun set. The next day we hiked down a relatively easy trail and every corner had a unique structure. This park had people but was not super crowded.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I agree with all those who claim Bryce to be their favorite national park. It is both compact (the amphitheater) and spacious (the rest of the park), allowing for a quick look or for a couple days looking and even more if you are hiking. We had the good fortune to see it after a snowstorm, and the added brilliance of the sun on snow was wonderful. The hoodoos are in a class of their own, as far as geological formations are concerned. It is easy to understand why they have figured in Native American mythology. This park is on a considerably smaller scale than Grand Canyon, or even Zion, so the experience is more personal and manageable. We have been here both when the shuttle service is operating and when it is possible/necessary to drive yourself and like both!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"If you follow the geography in the United States north from northern Arizona to central Utah, there is a pattern to the amount of rock has eroded. At the Grand canyon, you get the spectacular canyon, very wide and very deep. The next big canyon to the north is Bryce Canyon. Although it lacks a big, powerful river like the Colorado, wind and water have carved spectacular formations. Like the Grand Canyon, you can drive/tour on the rim and look down to see beautiful views - you have to go further north to Zion for a place that you drive through such canyons. Unlike the Grand Canyon and Zion, however, Bryce is yet sparsely crowded enough that you can drive your own car to parking lots next to many of the most interesting vistas (many people are surprised to get to Zion, for instance, and find that you HAVE to park at the Visitor's center and take a bus to get most anywhere.) If you want to go down into Bryce Canyon, you hike down, but there is more vegetation and natural shade than the iconic Grand Canyon hikes, and it seems less steep, making for some easier and safer hikes than the Grand Canyon offers.

Once we crested the top, though, it was well worth the view! We noticed that there were horse trails to take, but we stuck to walking. It was also to drive from viewpoint to viewpoint.

Make sure to drive out to some viewpoints: Bryce Point is a must-see stop as well.","April 6, 2016",Beautiful: Can easily see a lot in 1 day,130,"Kansas City, Missouri",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"If you've followed me this far in my reviews, Bryce Canyon National Park is the fourth one (of five) to be sure to visit on your Grand Circle tour. The main Park road is 18 miles long from Fairyland Point to Rainbow Point with numerous turn-out for the breathtaking vistas. On clear days you can see 100 miles. More of the same advice - make reservations EARLY. You can hike DOWN among the ""Hoodoos"" and hike back out. Another quiet Park from which you can thoroughly enjoy Sunset and Sunrise Points. Of course everyone eventually stops at Ruby's Inn for a meal at the Park entrance. If you depart to the East through Tropic Valley you will enter Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument on the way to Capitol Reef National Park.","April 6, 2016",UTAH ROCKS - 5 Great National Parks,73,"Surprise, Arizona",5

We went in March so it was pretty cold (well, cold for a Florida girl) and some of the walking trails were snowed over and therefore unhikable with our little ones. But we did the Thor's Hammer hike and got as far as the Queen's Garden. It was excellent! The kids even had fun and didn't gripe about hiking the whole time! The switchbacks at the top are fun for them and the scenery is unique. We missed out on the Bristlecone Pine walk because of the trail being snowed over and that's the only thing that was a negative for us on this trip.

Some travel advice is to drive to Rainbow Point first (about 18 miles from the Visitors Center) and work your way back with all the viewpoints being on your side of the road. Our late winter visit was cold, but we didn't battle so any people. Try to stop at all viewpoints. The amphitheater hike/walk is a must do.

Drink twice as much water as you think you will need and begin hydrating before your trip. Also be sure to bring water with you.2. The elevation is 8,000-9,000 feet so you will need to slow down and pace yourself.3. Stop at the visitor's center and acclimate yourself to the trails and overlooks.4. Drive the speed limit, or lower! We saw someone get pulled over, so know that the limits are strongly enforced.5. Not all of the overlooks have guardrails. Wear shoes with good soles.6. Monitor your children carefully. We saw some kids acting so reckless that my dare-devil 15 year old was even afraid for them!7. Plan your bathroom breaks!8. Each overlook has it's own special nuance, so visit as many as you can.9. Consider driving to the farthest point first (18 miles out) and then work your way back. 10. Early morning is a great time to hike because fewer people are on the trails.11. Wear layers, the temperature drops significantly at night.12. Bring chapstick and sunscreen. The air is very dry.13.

Although while many trails were still closed, there was a quieter, less hectic pace to the park. The best way to see the park if you are going in the off season is to drive to the end of the park - 18 miles and then start back. That way you will not need to cross over traffic. All stops are on the east side of the park. There are many picnic benches, so bring a lunch. And do stop at the Visitor Center.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is a beautiful canyon, unlike anything you've ever seen. If you have mobility or pulmonary issues you could probably explore the park in a day, stopping at the various overlooks. Our favorite stopping points were Sunset Point and Bryce Point, although they're all worth stopping at. Even if you can only walk to the edge of the canyon you will be amazed. At Sunset Point if you go down the trail just a little bit you can walk around a bend and look through a natural window into the Silent City, which looks like it is ablaze in the late afternoon light. The walk down the small trail to Bryce Point is definitely worth the time and effort for a beautiful look back down the canyon and at some of the windows formations. If you have more time, hike down into the canyon and take the Navajo Loop Trail (which begins at Sunset Point) then connect with the Queen's Garden Trail (which ends at Sunrise Point). You can park in the same parking lot for both and you'll get a good look at the canyon from down below. The ascent back up to the canyon rim is a little more gentle from the Queen's Garden than it is from the Navajo Loop. There are lengthier hikes available as well for avid hikers.

What you can't quite document digitally is how vast the structures are and just how small you can feel.

So far, top 3 favorite national park (sequoia is pretty cool too). You can see so much from up close. Everyone say Zion is the better of two, but I disagree.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"For a better experience visiting this national park is doing driving the main road and make the corresponding side rail stops wherever we go driving, although most of the attractions are in the back lane. You will need at least 30 minutes to drive and 10 or 20 min for each of the stops, so plan ahead. I stay outside the national park but this was not a problem for me since I had the annual pass and I had to pay extra money. The next day I only focus on a quick visit to the main attraction is the Navajo Loop trail. Low clouds that had created a mystery at the edges of the canyon. I was lucky to see a pronghorn across the road was very quiet which means a chance to get my camera and take pictures, after they ran.","March 8, 2016",The Second NP of my trip.,51,"Monterrey, Mexico",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,Me and my husband travelled to Bryce Canyon park from Zion park which took us around 2 hours . Bryce Canyon is totally different with its characteristic hoodoos which have been formed due to years of erosions .. They give a spectacular appearance to the whole region We did a navajo loop trail .. It gets colder as u enter the canyon deep .. The whole trail is too scenic !

Parks service had cleared the main roads and parking areas to allow easy access (had been up to 3' deep in places). A number of places were closed off for the winter (understandable due to the depth of snow). Trails were still open although with caution.Canyon itself was stunning, all the more so because the snowfall highlghted every detail.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We were visiting the Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in Kanab UT so we decided to take the short (hour) scenic drive on Hwy 89 to Bryce Canyon National Park. We arrived around 1 pm and stopped by the visitors center for a map of the overlooks and asked the Park Ranger how long we would need to see everything by car. We weren't sure that we would be able to see everything in two and a half hours but we succeeded without being rushed. We began our tour by driving to the most distant overlook 17 miles away. Then we made our way back towards the visitor center, stopping at every overlook for photos.The park is magnificent - even more so with the snow cover. The roads were clear, however there were a few icy spots on some of the trails leading to the overlooks. Temperatures ranged from 49-55 F depending on the elevation. We practically had the park to ourselves. There was no traffic. I doubt that we saw more than 40 people during our adventure. This is definitely the time of year to go, weather permitting of course.We finished our car tour by 4 pm and drove back to Kanab for the evening.","February 23, 2016",Covered all the overlooks in 2.5 Hours.

They gave us ideas on where to watch the sunrise and sunset from and where to XC-ski and snowshoe. They had a huge offering of books, maps and gift/souvenirs on hand.We went to Sunst point, sunrise point and a couple others. We hiked down the Navajo Trail for a bit but you need good traction boots or crampons to feel safe.We snowshoed to get to views you otherwise would not see without the snowshoes so bring some or rent some at Ebenezers.

It felt like it was just us in the park with Ranger Jim providing amazing insights, information and laughs along the way. With the sun shining and looking out over the hoodoos of Bryce was one of the best things I have ever done. Check in at the visitor center at least an hour before (check the website for details), make sure you have hiking shoes or similar, warm clothes (ski pants were a good idea) and get ready for a unique experience.

I was scheduled to go horseback riding through the Canyon that day--I hadn't planned on needing Winter gear in May, so after a hasty run to the gas station across the road for some snow mobile gear, I drove to Bryce. With fog still sitting in the Canyon it was an awe-ing experience, to ride a line of horses among the hoodoos. By the time the tour was ending, the sun was burning off the fog and we could really see the expanse of the hoodoos and the park. Just FANTASTIC geography!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We have been to about 50 parks and this is one of our favorite. The views are incredible. There are many scenic views that you can see from the road or within a short walking distance. We were here in the winter time, with snow on the ground, but still able to see a lot. Wallstreet was iced over, and too dangerous to hike, but plenty of other areas open to hike. I would recommend wearing the clampons for your shoes, if you dont have any, you can purchase them from the visitor center. They are about $25, but well worth it. There are many hikes that anyone in moderate shape can do. There were people of all ages on the couple of trails that i did. This is our second time here in the winter. We will need to visit during months without snow in order to hike all the trails that are currently iced over. Definitely worth the visit. The trail that I would recommend starts at sunset point down a steep hill into the canyon called the Navajo trail, toward queen gardens, you ascend again towards sunrise point, after the hill there is just a small flat trail back to sunrise point.

Even for Winter and nights of -6 degrees, there were plenty of people but very tolerable. I don't think I could appreciate it during high season with tonza folks. The snow adds a dramatic and unexpected aesthetic. Experience was for me about as close as I'll come to visiting another planet. For those with buckets this is a must. 62 or over? $10 gets you lifetime pass for all nat'l parks. And it's by the car, so people with you don't pay.","January 9, 2016",Nothing Like It,0,Vermont,5

During my visit the high temperature was 18 F so was happy for the ability to drive around to the various points and do some short walks along the rim.

Bryce Canyon National Park,We reached there just half an before sunset (as per the accuweather almanac) on our way from Zion. The Zion-Bryce route is just too scenic especially the tunnels were too much fun for the kids. There are 2 archs along the route framing the road & they seem so welcoming like doorways to another world. When we reached there we were so awestruck by the beauty of it all. It was a a bit cloudy so there seemed to be a intricate play of sun & shade. The Inspiration Point had the best view as per my opinion & also wider range.,"January 7, 2016",Awesome sunset,40,"Boston, Massachusetts",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I've been to Bryce 5 times now (4x the week of Thanksgiving and 1x in March). I am from the Boston, MA area so I am used to snow. I was looking up some information regarding some of the hikes I have yet to do in Bryce and while perusing reviews I have to share my experiences. It's so breathtaking my Dad cried upon the first view into the amphitheater. For it to really wow you - get out of the car, prepare properly and exert some effort. I am amazed at the people who gave this spectacular place negative reviews based on their lack of preparation, weather conditions, other visitor behavior and pure laziness. Don't expect the rangers to hand hold you every step of the way. There is one road. If you can't figure it out maybe you should have stayed home with your remote control in your hand. I don't like other people's second hand smoke either but you are reviewing the park ....or so I thought. Now that I have vented I will say the place is magical TO ME. All 5 trips we stay in Springdale at the gate of Zion NP. It's a quaint town with nice places to eat. We hike in Zion and go over to Bryce 2x during our week. We love the drive thru the Mt Carmel highway in Zion. It's stunning. We plan our days based on the weather. The elevation is higher in Bryce than Zion so it's colder (if foercast is rain in Zion it may be snow at Bryce). We have always had spectacular outings. Sometimes it's been cold, icy and/or snowy. We are NOT cold as we've brought proper layers along with proper hiking boots, gaiters and microspikes. I always carry an extra pair of socks and gloves in these conditions. I have given my gloves to a 6 year old who was from Florida. He had never seen snow and was making snow balls against his Mom's wishes. I gave my socks to a woman who had wet/cold feet as she had sneakers in conditions that required a boot. I know I've been unprepared before but these handful of negative reviews reminded me that we have to take some responsibility for ourselves and be fair when reviewing a park. If you just drive through you have not experienced the park. Your loss. I love the trails to myself in November while the rest of you slide around in Keds, snap a photo, and jump back in the car. I will go in May this year with my niece. I cannot wait to do the Fairyland loop and other hikes with her. This will be her first time seeing the beauty of the southwest parks.","January 4, 2016",My opinion,6,"Ipswich, Massachusetts",5

When we went back, we could not make it into the park the next day (even though it WAS open) and were afraid we would not make it back out again if we tried.

There is a longer road with various viewpoints down to the south, which is interesting but I would say optional.

Hiked up to some of the closed road points thru the snow and the views and solitude where magnificent . Unless they could drive right to the parking lot most of tourist would not park and walk.

Then we inquired about the roads since their was snow on the ground. They were in good condition, but a 4x4 was helpful.We were able to stop at all the vista points, take pictures, absorb the scenery and watch people play in the snow. You had to be careful when walking because of the ice and snow.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!One of my favorite National Parks. This is a visual park that appears to see things from “the TOP down”. As opposed to Zion National Park, which is more “looking from the bottom up”.The structures look a lot like various icicles that are attached at the floor below you and then going vertically upward to the horizontal where you are standing. Getting smaller and smaller as they rise up and reach the top. The colors are AMAZING. Being here is reminiscent to what you might notice if you were in the Badlands National Park (seeing things from the top looking down). However here, the reds, rouges, and lighter colors form a visual, that is not only different, it is brighter/sharper/more colorful and without question STUNNNNNNING!There are several viewing areas. As you change where you are, the vista changes. WOW is my reaction.There are also trails that you can walk. So, the option is yours whether you want to just pass through and see it from above (along the main road way), or take the time (a full day at least) to walk the trails and see it as well from below.Your call.Either way.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"As described in my book ""The Canyon Chronicles"": “Bryce National Park was created in 1928 in order to showcase and protect what is arguably one of America’s most phantasmagoric parks. It features a fairly shallow canyon of colossal rock pillars, called hoodoos. And true to their name, they cast a spell on all those who gaze into their depths. For almost 60 million years, Bryce laid at the bottom of a large inland sea. Fifty million years ago, during the Tertiary Period, rivers and streams began to deposit iron-rich sediments atop the original fresh water layers. The iron is what gives the Claron Formation its psychedelic orange hues, and water, wind, and ice did the rest, creating a canyon full of stony needles stretching gracefully into the sky.”• Utah is an hour later than Arizona!• Wi-Fi coverage at Bryce National Park is limited to the lobby of the Lodge. That’s it!• There are multiple motel, food and shopping services located right outside the Park in the small town of Bryce City, but it takes forever to get back into the park because of all the traffic at the entrance station. Motel rooms in the town of Bryce will run you about $150 a night.• Remember that you are at about 8,500 feet and the oxygen is thinner, so it’s harder to breathe.• Weather – From April through October, days are pleasant, and the nights cool. Winter days are cold and bright. Most overlooks remain open even in winter.• Bryce features some of the clearest skies in the Southwest. The combination of high elevation, clean dry air, and the lack of light pollution make Bryce Canyon star gazing truly exceptional. The Park Service offers a Dark Ranger Program to help you witness and learn about the ancient world above you in the sky.• The Dixie National Forest surrounds the park. Take any dirt road you see and you are free to camp primitively anywhere you like. If you want to camp with bathrooms and water, there are numerous campgrounds along Highway 12 in Red Canyon. There are also private campgrounds at Ruby’s and several other locations very near the park.• Wildlife – Bryce features some very unique species of animal including Pronghorn Antelope, Great Basin Rattlesnake, Mountain Lion, Utah Prairie Dog, Uinta Chipmunk, Golden-Mantled Ground Squirrel, and the noisy Steller’s Jays and Clark’s Nutcrackers.","December 23, 2015",No Place Like It On Earth!,396,"Annapolis, Maryland",5

Have camped and hiked in the park as well as taken thousands of pictures, and never tire of its orange/red/mauve/white hoodoos and the high altitude clear air. Surprisingly, the afternoon is the best general time to photograph the park as the badlands it is known for are on the east side of the plateau and the sun is better captured then. Sunny days or ones with a bit of passing clouds and rain are the best, and while summer is good here, the pictures with snow on the hoodoos are really stunning and only captured after rare snow events in the winter.

Once there, you can take a small tram type bus to a number of the first 'overlooks', the experience is good, but you may be overwhelmed by the numbers of tourist, and you will not see the true beauty of the canyon.. Drive the nearly 18 mile length of the canyon as I did as a researcher for SeniorCitizenLocalWeb and you will see sights that most tourist will never see.

The way the colours change and the shadows form new shapes and open up scenes that could or should be in a movie.

Though less able to make the trek down the paths into the canyon (it wouldn't be fair to the rescuers if needed) we were able to see lots of the park from the pull outs and overlooks. If you are younger, take the trek-it's a unique and mysterious place you don't want to miss. There are numerous places to park and benches to sit for a rest. There was a forest fire in the distance that increasingly filled the sky with smoke--that was horrifying to watch but at the same time were were glad to get our pics early in the day.

It was snowing the whole night, which we spent at Ruby's Inn. Since it was snowing in the morning too, we decided to take a drive along Highway 12 which was incredible too! By noon the snow had settled in Bryce and the amphitheater looked stunning dressed in snow. The red sandstone Hoodoos with white caps on!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is amazing. It is so beautiful. It’s breathtaking to see in person. Pictures don’t do it justice. We were lucky enough to see it with a little bit of snow, which made it look extra pretty against the red rocks. Sunset and Sunrise point were incredible. The only downside is the price gouging to get into the park. They charge a $30 fee for a 7 day pass. If they had an option for a 1 or even a 3 day pass at a reduced rate that would be better but they don’t. I know that money is needed to keep the parks maintained, but this is ridiculous. If you are going to other parks in the area like Zion it’s another $30 to get in. You can buy an annual pass for $80, which is good if you are going to more than one place, but it’s still outrageous. Bryce Canyon has approximately 1.5 million visitors per year. Multiply that by $30 per car load and that is a lot of money. President Theodore Roosevelt established the United States Forest Service (USFS) to protect the national forests, parks, wild life, game preserves and monuments. During his presidency he protected 230 million acres of public land so that future generations could enjoy it. President Woodrow Wilson created the National Park Service in 1916 to protect and conserve these national treasures for future generations to enjoy. I don’t think that charging the public $30 per carload per national park is what these two presidents had in mind.","December 1, 2015",Incredible to see,229,"Montreal, Canada",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce, an exquisitely gorgeous place, is technically not a canyon, but a high mesa with dramatic erosion on the sides of the mesa creating hoodoos and other formations. A 17 mile drive (longer round trip) can take you to the highest point with many stops along the way, each a bit difference. The closest and most popular have paths leading down from the top so the hoodoos can be viewed from below as well as above. Paths vary in difficulty, of course. Queens Garden is not too difficult and seeking the rocks up close makes it well worth a bit of effort . . . remembering that however far one goes down, they have to come back up! Be sure to wear hiking shoes. The paths are often ""graveled"" with small rocks. Good footing is essential.","November 24, 2015",dramatic AND walkable - - don't miss it,4,"Gaithersburg, Maryland, United States",5

The Hoodoos are really interesting to look at. It really made for a cool effect, especially with a little snow on them.That said, since we only had sneakers on, we couldn't go down in to the canyon and had to stay at the overlooks. The trails into the canyon were covered with ice from all of the other people who had gone down. It was so slick that we saw a couple men basically ice skate in their sneakers downhill on the trail. No idea how they were going to get back up. If you plan to go in the winter and want to go in the canyon, make sure you have the right shoe gear.I would love to go back in the spring or with the right foot gear.","November 24, 2015",Awesome!,48,"Los Angeles, California",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,Our family of four visited Bryce Canyon for 3 days and 2 nights the week before Thanksgiving. It is an beautiful National Park that should not be missed! Bryce Canyon is more of a piece of 3d art formations! It has a truly magical feel to it! We enjoyed hiking the Bristlecone loop at mile 18 and were able to get excellent looks at a Clarks Nutcracker and Mountain Chickadees. The trails had a small covering of snow but were were able to hike without any issues. We also hiked the Queen Anne and Horse Trail loop for spectacular looks at the formations. I highly recommend hiking down as low as possible to build a better understanding of how huge and amazing the formations are. Bryce Canyon has a picture perfect view at every step you take. Bryce Point is a must see at sunset! We attempted to view the stars but found the moon to be way too bright. We could see hints of what other rave about but were not able to get the full experience.

We stopped at every view point but my favorite view points were – Sunset Point, Inspiration Point, Natural Bridge, and Rainbow Point.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is undeniably beautiful. The U.S. has a knack for establishing national parks in the most extraordinary places. Somehow Utah was given more than a typical share; Bryce Canyon is one of five national parks in the state. Bryce allows spectacular views over hoodoos that stand as high as 50 meters (or yards, if you prefer). You can hike down among the hoodoos to get another perspective. What I found incredible is that the pictures you take in Bryce (especially if you are in the park for sunrise) are equivalent to the pictures you see in the gift shops and tourist books. (That is not try in other parks; many shots of the Grand Canyon seem to have benefited from the magic of post-production.) While Bryce is wonderful, it is not the top tier of U.S. national parks that I have visited. That's why I called it a ""semi-precious stone"" in the crown of U.S. national parks. For me the priceless gems are parks like Zion (about an hour from Bryce), Canyonlands (also in Utah), the Grand Canyon and Redwoods.","November 13, 2015",Semi-precious stone in the crown of U.S. national parks,61,,4

As a 50-something in good condition, I did not find the Sunrise Point descent or the trails very strenuous. The only place I ran out of breath was the climb up Sunset Point at the end of my hike. If I had to do it again, I'd just turn around and hike back up at Sunrise Point. Sadly, the day I was there, only a few people were doing the whole loop.

The views are breathtaking. Throughout the canyons are hoodoos created by the unique rock layers coupled with wind and erosion. Utterly spectacular. The rim trail, which extends over 11 miles, is easily accessible for everyone and provides the greatest overall views of the canyons.However, to really experience the majesty of Bryce, one ought to hike some of the many trails into the canyon. There are hiking trails for every level. We hiked the Navajo/Queen's Garden Loop then went down past Sunrise Point to the trail down to Tower Bridge and hooked up to the Fairyland Trail, which is not as popular and quite strenuous. Both of these hikes exceeded 8 miles apiece. Hiking really is the main activity here. However, there are park rangers that provide information and conduct programs, and there are even guided hikes in the moonlight when there is a full moon. There are plenty of camp sites, a classic national park lodge with superior accomodations, a very good dining room, a general store, and a terrific gift shop.

We hadn't heard of Bryce Canyon before we embarked on our 4 week tour but it turned out to be one of the highlights.We drove to the end of the 19 mile trail first and worked back towards the visitors centre at the park entrance, seemed to flow well this way.

If we go again I would plan ahead better and bring food for breakfast and more snacks (our hotel room had quite a big fridge). We did the star gazing lecture and telescopes.

I saw the other two view points in that area as well but Inspiration was best. If you don't have much time at least check out this view point and the other two. I did the Navajo Trail. It is a must! Seeing the views from above, like at Inspiration, is only part of the experience. The Navajo Trail takes you down into canyon and let's you experience it up close. It's a loop so you don't have to repeat any part of the hike. It's an awesome experience to hike down into these huge landforms. I did the hike in about an hour with stops for pic taking which I did quite a bit. I'm in fairly good shape. I noticed people huffing and puffing as I went down into the canyon as they came up.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon was on my bucket list. I enjoyed this national park the best of all of Utah's parks (which we included on this trip)! Its beauty cannot be overstated. A hoodoo is a pinnacle, spire or odd-shaped rock left standing by the forces of erosion. My favorite overlook was Bryce Point which is a view deep down to the canyon called the Ampitheater with hundreds of tightly-packed hoodoos. I read before our trip that these images look very similar to the army uncovered at Pompeii. I would prefer to think of them as soldiers standing shoulder to shoulder facing these red monoliths worshiping the God who created them! We took the hike between Bryce Point and Inspiration Point. It is approximately 1.4 miles and mostly downhill (well worth it)...the views are amazing. Do not miss any one of the viewpoints! The forest is dominated by blue spruce, Douglas fir and white fir; I picked out the perfect Christmas tree! God surely ""put in extra hours"" on this breathtaking creation!! I have never seen anything so picturesque in this world (our photos do not do justice). Every view from the overlook is superb and different from the others.

The best view points are the Bryce point, inspiration point and sunset/sunrise points. Due to the rain we were not able to see sunrise or sunset on the canyon. Do try to take a hike into the canyon. The queen's trail is about 0.8 miles down and has a well groomed easy path. The walk up is a little harder but I believe the altitude adjustment was the reason for the slower pace we needed. Beautiful photos from all view points. So hard to not take photos. Every where you look there is something new to see. All along the park are well groomed asphalt walking or bike paths.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is a US National Park located in southwest Utah. It is located about 260 miles south of Salt Lake City and about 260 miles north of Las Vegas. Bryce Canyon National was first settled by Ebenezer Bryce in 1874 and the National Park was created in 1928. The highlight of this park is the amazing geological structures known as hoodoos (or odd shaped natural pillars). The Park has a nice Visitor Center which is located just inside the park entrance and is a great place to get organized and ask a Ranger for hiking advice. There is also a shuttle bus stop conveniently located just outside the front door.I visited this amazing National Park with my wife on Sunday afternoon in late May and really enjoyed hiking and taking in all of the fantastic views. There are great places to hike in this Park including the easier Rim Trail, Queens Garden and the Navajo Trails (I hiked these three and had a great time). There are also a few longer and harder trails but I did not have time to do any of those. The Bryce Canyon Shuttle bus is a great way to see the park if you do not want to do a lot of hiking. The shuttle bus takes you too many of the best scenic overlooks where you can look down on the natural amphitheatre. Just hop off the bus and walk a short distance and then get back on the bus and go to the next stop. You can also drive through the Park but it is crowded and there are not of lot of extra parking spots. Overall I really enjoyed visiting this National Park and highly recommend it. Also, if you are visiting nearby Zion National Park make sure you do a quick day trip to Bryce.","October 16, 2015",Amazing National Park,833,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5

You can see an amphitheatre of these from various points on the summit of Bryce Canyon, but if possible it is recommended to go one or more of the hiking trails to get more intimate views of these incredible structures.

There is also a bus that you can get in the afternoon that takes you to the bottom of the formations and is free, but needs to be signed up for. That tour is about 3 hours long and has a person on board to give you the history and geology of the region. Check at the Visitor Center for that tour. There are also horseback rides you can sign up for of varying durations that will allow you to see ""under the rim"" of the canyon without having to hike it.

Bryce Canyon National Park,We enjoyed Bryce. It is one of those parks where most of the attraction is looking down into the canyon (vs Up from a valley floor). We took the strategy of driving all the way to the end and then working our way back. Seemed to work pretty well. All of the attraction is on the canyon side of the road. You can see most of what you want from the various lookout points. Parking at the lookouts can be difficult. Shuttles stop running in October so you will need a car or a paid tour in the off season. Inspiration point is a strenuous hike for many but worth it. Going to the end and then hitting the lookouts on the way back will put you at Sunset point in the afternoon - after the sun has moved out of that part of the canyon. This sets you up for a nice walk on the Navajo Loop. This is a 1.3 mile total down the Navajo Trail and up the Wall Street trail. This is the less strenuous option of the loop. Remember to stop and look up and look behind you once in a while. It is easy to get focused on your next step or where you are going.,"October 12, 2015",Try the Navajo Loop,13,"Centuria, Wisconsin",4

The only great way to go on an 18 day tour of the National Parks is by bus so that you can observe everything and not have to worry about the road and driving. Grand Circle does an amaziing job of supplying you with a knowledgable, energetic program director to make your trip that much more meaningful and a safe bus driver. We traveled from Rapid City South Dakota through 6 states visiting numerous National Parks including :Yellowstone, Bryce, Zion, the Grand Canyon, Mesa Verde, and Monument Valley along with other sites such as Salt Lake City, Glen Canyon, Lake Powell, Antelope Slopes, Durango to Silverton on a steam engine train and Vail Colorado.

The lifelike limestone formations (hoodoos) and the natural architectural structure and just breathtaking. You can view all of this from many sights along the canyon rim (each on is different) or you can hike down into the structures themselves. This is the very best way to see them, but the hike down, around and back up is arduous, so take plenty of water and don't overdo it (be ready to head back to the rim as soon as your legs feel tired).

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited Bryce early October on a weekday. Arrived early at 8am and opted to check out the four popular sites first, while they weren't busy. Be prepared for the cold and the changing weather 'coz as we drove to the farthest overlook (Rainbow point) that morning the fog was so thick we could barely see the closest rock formations at the viewpoint. The sky did open up a bit and we tried to go back the same afternoon to the overlooks where we missed out on but alas, the fog came back down quite quickly. Arriving early meant we got to have easy parking and not too many people yet. But it got busy real quick. We did the Navajo-Queen's garden loop, unfortunately parts of the loop was closed due to the weather. We hiked in the rain but even then the hoodoos still looked pretty up close. When the clouds parted and the sun came out though, there was a quick deluge of people who met us on our way up as they were all waiting for the weather to ease up a bit. The rain may have made the colors jump out a bit more.As most others would have posted, arrive early, and, based from my trip, be prepared for the weather. You will be in awe of nature's beauty the moment you arrive. First two pics attached are from Rainbow point and the last one is from rainbow point showing the rain on its way.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited Bryce Canyon this year (2015) in July. I had seen canyons before, but what I saw here was simply out of the world and breathtaking. Unlike the other canyons where one gets awed by the sheer size of the rocks and the deep gorge, here nature seems to have donned the role of a great sculptor and has sculpted each of the rocks into an exquisite master piece. One rock formation looks like a group of musicians, where as the other group of rocks looks like a delicately sculpted temple and in the end it is left to the imagination of the beholder to liken it to an earthly object. This reminded me of the Roman Amphitheater I had seen years back and hence the title of my review. However, I must confess that only the general architecture reminded me of that man made structure, but the beauty of this place is beyond comparison to anything man made. We started off our visit from the sunset point from where you get a very good overall view of the canyon. Then we took a trail which took us to the bottom of the canyon, roughly I reckon about 400 feet below. When we were treking back up, sudenly the skies opened up with a hail storm which although lasted for about ten minutes but was sufficient to drench us completely. This made our ascent a bit difficult as the canyon floor had become slushy and the mud has a fair bit of clay. Our shoes were covered with thick layer of mud. However, we were surprised pleasently to find next to the car park a faucet and a wire brush to clean our shoes. Really very thoughtful of the park authorities. We then saw the natural bridge structure. This is another nature's engineering at her best. Although it is named a bridge this is an arch connecting the two sides of the canyon.","October 8, 2015",Nature's Amphitheater,52,"Bengaluru, India",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We spent a full day of our week long ""canyon exploring vacation"" in Bryce Canon NP. We spent our previous 3 days in Zion Canyon NP. (Be sure to buy the $80 annual NP pass if visiting numerous National Parks) Bryce Canyon NP was SO COOL! With Bryce Canyon you start your hiking adventure from the top of the canyon. From the top looking down, everyone looks like little ants winding their way down the MANY switchbacks. We went counter clockwise down Navajo Loop trail into the bottom of the canyon and had a little granola and water break with the local chipmunk. (He is so funny watching and climbing up onto the stump wanting some or your crumbs. Don't feed them, just enjoy watching them and get a laugh.) We then hiked out the Queens Garden and was going to continue the loop up to the top of the canyon. However, we wanted more. So we returned to the bottom of the Navajo Loop and went out the Peek-a-Boo Loop. This loop was a little strenuous and was hot BUT it was AMAZING! (There were shady spots along the way) I am so glad we added this loop to our day's hike. It had some amazing views from different heights. We returned from Peek-a-Boo to the bottom of the Navajo Loop and went up the left side (the side we had not yet done). It was filled with switchbacks and sights and shade. The entire canyon reminded of the sand dripping castles we made as kids at the beach. The top of the canyon and hike down was cool and in the 70s but the hike out to Peek-a-Boo got quite warm.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce distinguishes itself from other parks and monuments in southern Utah with its proliferation of magical hoodoos. Visiting it is like stepping into a wonderland inhabited by other-worldly creatures and castles, all formed in a rainbow of earthy hues ranging from white to deep red. Arriving from the west, you approach the park through brilliant Red Canyon and travel through rock arch tunnels. During our two visits to Bryce, we found it to be one of the easiest parks to get around in and see what it has to offer. There is one main road that follows the rim of the canyon, with all of the overlooks just steps away on the same side of the road. On our first trip, we spent several days in the park and found plenty to do. Our second trip was limited to one day and we were able to comfortably fit in most of the viewpoints, skipping only the busiest ones near the lodge, Sunrise and Sunset Points. Although it can be difficult to find a parking spot without waiting at the busier overlooks, also including Inspiration Point and Bryce Point, once you get to the viewing area, there is plenty of room to spread out and take it all in. Each point does offer a different angle and aspect of the canyon so it’s worth making each stop if you can. It’s not unreasonable to expect to visit each viewpoint at a comfortable pace in one day. It’s an experience you won’t find elsewhere. ","October 4, 2015",Unique,72,Phoenix AZ,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited Bryce Canyon in September which appears to be the best time of year. The weather was perfect and the crowds were very small. If you are a senior citizen, remember to purchase the lifetime senior citizen pass to all National Parks for $10. This is an immediate savings off of the normal $30 per-car or $15 individual daily admission price. You can drive your own vehicle in Bryce or us the Bryce Canyon Shuttle which is easy and convenient. I would recommend the shuttle which is free. Also free is the Rainbow Point Shuttle Tour which departs at 9 AM and 1:30 PM daily. You must make reservations for this tour by calling 435-834-5290 up to 24 hours in advance. We were able to reserve the 1:30 tour at 9:30 that morning - but it was September remember. This is an excellent tour. Our tour guide, Spike, was full of information about the park, native plants and animals as well as pointing out what to see at each stop. There is no time to hike from this tour, however. If you want to hike some of the trails, even the short ones, take the regular park shuttle. You can also brink your bicycle on the shuttle bus so one idea is to take the Shuttle to Rainbow point and bike back down the park's main road. It is not all downhill, but it is a relatively easy ride. When we were there in Sept 2015 a bike path was under construction that looks to be a great way to experience the park. In order to check the weather at Bryce, search for Bryce Canyon City if your weather service does not find Bryce Canyon itself. In getting there, you can set your GPS to any of the Ruby's Inn addresses as all of Bryce Canyon City is owned and operated by Ruby's Inn and the Bryce Canyon visitor center is 50 yards further up the road from Ruby's.

Bryce Canyon National Park,With so many natural wonders to see it's easy to miss some good ones. Bryce Canyon is one place not to miss with both its excellent natural structures and wide views from its highpoint. Its worthwhile spending some time reading the boards to understand how it was formed and doing the walk around the canyon itself but beware it is slippery when wet and the mud on your shoes will take ages to get off but its worth it! I'm not sure what Mr Health and Mr Safety of the UK would make of it though! Have fun here and enjoy.,"October 1, 2015",Some superb natural sights and views,77,"Christchurch, United Kingdom",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We had a short time only to visit a national park in Utah. Chose Bryce over Zion as we wanted to hike in slightly cooler weather. Extremely good choice as early morning weather fairly cool at 50 degrees but midday up to mid 70's. Small park compared with others which means you can cover more than one trail. Truly awesome hoodoos and if you are of a reasonable fitness with suitable walking shoes return by "" Wall Street "".We also managed to walk to fairyland point. This is much quieter and if we had more time would have liked to carry on around the 8 mile loop. Fantastic area which we would love to visit again. Only negative comment is the admission cost of 30 dollars covers 7 days but only in one park. As we were moving about it would have been good if it allowed admission to some of the other parks.

As the day went on, the place became crowded, so start early.","September 30, 2015","Amazing, but start early and leave early",62,"Sacramento, California",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We were blown away with Bryce Canyon. In the third park in three days, we decided this one was far more interesting and impressive than the Grand Canyon. While the Grand Canyon is grand, the detail and richness of Bryce gives it a much higher ""wow"" value. The Rim Trail takes you around the rim, naturally, so you can see all the formations from various views in the amphitheater. The way the light plays off the rock from these angles is amazing. The shear volume of the formations is unbelievable. A lady working at the desk of the shuttle building outside Ruby's RV Park suggested we take the shuttle to the Bryce Point lookout and walk back. It was great advice as this gives more downhill walking, while giving the compete view of the canyon.The height issue was a problem for me, so I had to crowd to the non-canyon side and grab trees or stand behind rocks to look out to the canyon floor, but I was able to do it. I'm glad I did. Fortunately, my wife doesn't suffer from my issues, so she had the camera and took a couple hundred shots in three miles of hiking.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited Bryce on 9/16/15 during our long trek through the southwest national parks (Grand Canyon, Capitol Reef, Bryce, and Zion), and found Bryce to be our favorite. Our cabin was located about 100' from the rim, and just a short stroll to one of the most-spectacular views I have ever seen. The cabins themselves, were recently renovated, and the interior was spacious, rustic, and comfortable - oh, and quiet. We noted that the cabins, but for the ""local"" styling differences, were identical to the cabins at Grand Canyon & Zion - about 15' square, with a small bathroom, updated fixtures, vaulted ceiling, rough-shewn beams, and a nice, little gas fireplace (which we needed at Bryce since it went into the 40's one night!).The hiking was great, and every step you took put you in a different view and perspective of the canyon. We took a scenic drive up the main road, stopping at all of the overlooks - and rarely saw a crowd.I was looking forward to the famous Bryce night sky, and I was not disappointed. I attended a little introductory session (very well attended), and rushed down to the welcome center, where they had set up some really good (10"" +) telescopes. But the beauty of the sky here didn't need a telescope, and I was really wowed by the presence of the Milky Way stretching from horizon to horizon. After looking through the telescopes, I went back to our cabin, but then walked out to the canyon rim to view the stars on my own. Unbelievable, that's all that I can say. The ranger said that you can see upwards of 7500 stars with the naked eye at Bryce - and he wasn't lying. I can state, without hesitation, that I saw more stars in the sky at Bryce than I have ever seen in my entire life. I laid on my back for an hour or so, just staring upward and drinking it all in. What a beautiful night.So far, Bryce is tops in almost every category - lodging, dining, hiking, views - it really has it all, and is a must see for anyone visiting the southwestern national parks.

We hiked Figure 8 - a bit arduous in the mid afternoon sun, but totally worth it. The only disappointment was the park ranger's presentation on the lunar eclipse which was the night we were there.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"As usual my wife spent weeks and weeks planning our trip to this destination - putting together suggested itineraries and scenarios. Purchase a book on Bryce and do some background planning if you want but the most practical advice I can give is to show up at the park and enjoy. It is very intuitive and the handout that you receive when you arrive has all the information you need to enjoy your stay. Our itinerary was out the window in minutes after arriving. We arrived early (9:00AM). We drove all the way to Rainbow Point to begin and then worked out way back out of the park. Starting this early seemed to place us ahead of most of the crowds. If you only have a day you can easily visit every stop and enjoy the park. Every time you think that there can't be anything morve beautiful than the spot you are at you discover that the next spot is even more stunning. It is really worth the time to hike up Bryce Point. We dscovered that the spots with picnic areas were the most crowded and difficult to find parking spaces. The bottom line for me - arrive early, don't complicate it and enjoy the day. I honestly think that many of the tour guides provide too much information and unnecessarily complicate your visit.","September 29, 2015",Don't Over Complicate- Just Enjoy,124,"Saint Paul, Minnesota",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We had seen photos of Bryce Canyon before we visited but nothing compares to seeing it for yourself. We got up early and drove in to see the sun rise. We parked near Bryce Point, but stayed quite near to the car park to watch, for two reasons: so that we could see the colour of the rocks change as they were bathed in sunshine (rather than seeing the sun rise itself), and to avoid standing in the mass of visitors that arrived by coach and who were chatting away. We shared our viewpoint with just three other people, all of whom respected the peacefulness of the occasion, and we enjoyed the whole experience so much more as a result.After the coach parties had left at around 7:30 we walked along to Bryce Point, which several other individuals and pairs also did, but for a short while we were the only people there. We decided after that to drive to the top of the park and work our way back. This strategy worked well, in that there were only a few other small groups at each view point (more at Inspiration Point, but with different directions in which to walk and explore the truly magnificent views) until we got to Sunset Point, which was mobbed at that stage in the day!As well as the experience of thinking we had seen THE best view, then seeing another that topped it, we loved seeing the animals that roam around the park, especially the chipmunks, as we hadn't seen these in the wild before.When we returned to the visitor centre we enjoyed watching e short film about the park, which greatly enhanced our enjoyment and understanding. The adjoining gift shop offers a good selection of souvenirs etc for purchase.Definitely a good idea to come early if you want to enjoy some of the views in peace, and to see the colour come to life as the sun rises, and before it gets too hot.

There are also shuttles that run continuously and you can get on and off at any of the picturesque stops. Hiking any of the many trails into the canyon is a different experience than viewing from above. Each is truly memorable. My husband and I hiked over 16 miles of trails and loved it.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon National Park is an incredibly beautiful national park to visit. It is a completely different experience to Zion National Park. In some aspects it is easier to manage. It is smaller and easier to do a number of the shorter hikes in one day than it is in Zion. The hoodoos are stunning but you get the best view of them by walking down into the canyon. Even if you do a short walk like the Navajo trail, it is worth it. That will only take you an hour. The shuttle bus is an excellent service. Get off at Bryce Point and walk downhill, stopping off at the various viewing points. Collect a map when you arrive at the visitor's center and you'll easily find your way around. The park seemed to have more European visitors than locals the day we were there, which was interesting. It seemed that Zion is more visited by locals. Whatever the demographics of visitation, this remarkable national park is a must see if in the area.","September 19, 2015",Unbelievably beautiful,1662,"Brisbane, Australia",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This review is about selfish human behavior at a national park. It's a beautiful place, but the smokers...come on!! The last thing you want to do while you are hiking and breathing heavy is to inhale cigarette smoke!! We encountered a smoker on the actual trail, (shocked by that one), had to dive off the trail to keep from breathing it. We saw more than a few up at the observation areas and especially at the restroom areas. I couldn't even go inside the restroom because it smelled like a smoky bar 10 feet outside of the door. I had to hold it and drive down to another one. Do not assume that everyone can breathe cigarette smoke! If I get headaches and nausea simply by breathing it at all, then others do too. I watched the looks on others faces as they noticed the smokers and they were appalled. Another thing, don't act like you are the only ones here! It's crowded, don't walk 2-3-4 people shoulder to shoulder and take up the entire walkway and play chicken with the people coming toward you. Are you so entitled that you can't move into a single file while others are coming? A man was walking with 3 other people, none of them moved, and looking down at his phone and almost ran right into me, where I had nowhere else to go. I said Excuse Me!! and he still didn't want to move. This happened many times, when people who are together think they have to walk side by side and forget about moving for anyone coming toward them. So Rude! All it takes is common courtesy to allow everyone an enjoyable experience, but when you get hundreds at a place at the same time, the bad apples are going to show. Never again will I return to this park when it's this time of year. Even in September, way too crowded.","September 17, 2015","Smokers have some manners! Smoke in your car! Not around others!

The rock formations in the canyons come in various shapes and sizes; beautiful scenery that will keep you in awe during your entire visit. Various viewpoint stops are marked, and well worth every stop. Some offer hikes, which are tremendously amazing and offer breathtaking views from the top and bottom of the canyon. While you may think that driving around the park is enough, the hikes around the park will take your experience to another level. The park offers numerous beautiful hikes at various levels; some easy, some dangerous. If you are able to stay at Bryce Canyon til dark, stargazing is another experience in itself. You'll experience an out of this world, clear view above the earth - orion's belt, the milky way, planets, shooting stars and more, are easily seen overhead.$30 gets you a pass for 7 days into the park, and just $20 more for an annual - every cent well worth it.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is a stunning landscape. Every direction the view fills you with awe at the colorful geology, the otherworldly scale, the endless views into the far distance of the towns to the East, the contrast between the rough rock formations and the green wooded meadows where you cross paths with wildlife. Even a confirmed urbanite like me was entirely sold on Bryce upon getting there. Language can be insufficient to describe how it impresses you.This IS quite a bit away from it all -- you mostly get there from either Salt Lake City or Vegas (and what a contrast it is to get there from Vegas -- from the artificial glitz, through the deadly desert, and on to natural beauty) and it will take you half the day, so just budget the time so as to not be rushed.A good strategy for me to explore the north half of the park is to get there early to use the shuttle buses in the morning and during the mid-day; then for the south half drive up all the way to the end (Rainbow Point) later in the afternoon so you can then go down hitting the various lookouts (that way you do not have to struggle with the incoming rush hour if you visit in high season. Very good programs at the visitor center as well as Ranger Talks and Ranger Walks appropriate to the season. As others have said, though, do bear in mind the altitude, Bryce will take your breath away physically as well as emotionally.Was able during my visit to take in one of the Astronomy Nights, which was quite special -- the docents, mostly grad students in astronomy themselves were so enthusiastic, you could tell how much they loved their field. To look at the sky in the clear air, at over 8000 feet high, away from the cities and see the the Milky Way rise, among all the stars that city lights have stolen from most of us... worth the trip, completely!","September 7, 2015",How to Find Words?,35,"San Juan, PR",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"The views of hoodoos, fins and canyon are absolutely stunning. Our favorite is the walk from Sunrise to Sunset point which we did at sunset, middle of the day and by full moon. Fairyland Point and Rainbow Point views are equally wonderful. The road into Fairyland often has pronghorn and there is a prairie dog colony right at the intersection of the road into Bryce Lodge and the main road. And the best experience of all is a hike down into the hoodoos - descending into the canyon is magical!","September 7, 2015",Magical Hoodoos and Fins,81,"Berkeley, California",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Make sure you do the 18 mile scenic drive through the park. They advise going all the way out, and then stopping at the viewpoints on the way back to always be making right hand turns. Make sure you get an early start to avoid the crowds. We hiked the 1 mile loop at the end of the Scenic Drive and the 3.5 mile loop from Sunset point to Sunrise point. The point to point hike was in the morning, and the colors on the hoodoos changed by the minute.

If you get nervous about long steep drop offs, you will be uncomfortable on the Navajo, though there is a wall on one side and the trail is generally wide. Steep beginning and end. BRING plenty of WATER!! It is dry (sucks the moisture right out of you) and gets quite warm at the bottom. Also a hat and sunscreen recommended. Good pair of walking shoes is adequate for this trail.

Furthermore, the scale of the topography boggles the mind. On the lighter side, the park contains the only ""Prairie Dog Crossing"" sign I have ever seen. Deer are easily seen, and one ofthe back country camp sites was closed due to (black?) bear activity though we failedto spot one. The park is well of the beaten track -- about 90 minutes from I-15 in southern Utah over a series of two lane roads.

A nice alternative is Cedar Breaks - it's very similar but not busy at all and higher in elevation so it's cooler.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"One of the most amazing natural wonders we've ever seen! We travelled with our children (4 & 7, both experienced hikers). It was definitely one of the highlights of our trip.One the first afternoon we drove up to Rainbow Point, making many many stops on the way back. It was very cold and windy so come prepared, and the light was less than perfect for pictures - but the views were still spectacular. The next day we did the Navajo trail, starting with the descent to Wall Street then walking in the canyon and climbing up to Thor's Hammer. It was amazing, everyone was deeply impressed and the hike was not too difficult for the kids- we stopped once in the canyon for snacks and water and a few times for pictures, and still made it in less than 3 hours. After a short break we drove to the Mossy Cave trail, located outside the park, which is very very easy but still a delight to see so much water in the desert.The Junior Ranger booklet was a bit complicated for them, partly since they don't speak English, I think it was the only one in our trip they did not complete.","September 5, 2015",A true miracle of nature! - even with young children,38,"Tel Aviv, Israel",5

We did take the extended 3 hour shuttle tour that goes to the end of the road - you need to make a reservation but for end of August, it was no problem. Booked just one day ahead and the bus wasn't even full. Every stop we took was breathtaking. The national park service has many great programs/guided hikes. One night they had a stargazing in the Visitor Center parking lot. Was great - haven't seen so many stars (and so bright!) in my life. Loved it. New fan of our National Parks.

We are not physically conditioned to hike into the canyon but did ok with the short walks along the rim. Very relaxing to just stroll casually and take in the sights. Also took the 3.5 hour Rainbow Tour with Jay. Excellent talk and learned much about the geology, trees, plants and features of the park and Colorado Plateau. Distant views form Yovapi Point.

It's not cut by a river and not technically a canyon but a mountain of sandstone cut by wind and rain water that created HooDoos.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited Bryce as part of a big Southwest road trip, and arrived in the middle of a Monday afternoon. I have to say - one of the most exciting parts was the drive in from the west, going through Red Canyon. We were mentally prepared for Bryce, but Red Canyon took us by surprise, and we didn't have much time to enjoy it. So, if you're driving in from the west, make sure to build in a little time to explore Red Canyon! Bryce itself was surprisingly crowded, but we still managed to stop by all of the viewpoints that we wanted to see, and do one short hike. This is a well-balanced park in terms of driving/hiking. If you just want to drive and hop out at viewpoints, you'll certainly see all of the spectacular views.

We walked the trail from Navajo Loop to Queens Garden; originally included Peekaboo Loop, but just had a look at the beginning and didn't take the 3 miles more. Navajo Loop in a shade was a nice walk downwards and the Queens Garden trail was with strong sunshine, fortunately lots of clouds came out and we made it! Rock formations were amazing and the squirrels, flowers; yes, it was a nice walk about 3 miles. There were groups of hikers around noon and the parking lot was a chaos and rangers were helping very organised.

We did a few hikes and also the viewpoint stops throughout the park. It can get very hot and dry so be sure to bring plenty of water.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This park is very busy but it is quieter than Zion once you move away from Sunrise & Sunset Points. You cannot be other than impressed by the Bryce Canyon Amphitheatre, it's stunning, but the rest of the park is well worth exploring. Make sure you go to Bryce Point because it's spectacular. In addition to the views we really enjoyed a hike around the Navajo Trail/Queens Garden Trail - I strongly suggest that you go around clockwise as recommended by the park guide because it is much easier. While there we saw quite a lot of wildlife including tiny hummingbirds, prairie dogs, deer and treecreepers.

There was a shuttle that would take you to each view point and you could make reservations to go to the far off Rainbow Point in the am or pm. Don't just stick to the view points though, make sure (if you are able) you hike down into the canyon or along the Rim trail that will take you from view point to view point.

The park rangers are strict about tourists standing on the edge taking selfies. Good. If you feel the necessity, you can walk down the Indian trail and enjoy an arduous trek with a few thousand of our ultra fit Far Eastern friends.

Beautiful colors, amazing views and tons of sites to take pictures at. Our kids did great, the switchbacks were a little tough and crowded coming up to Sunset.

You can go either way but this way the hike back up to the rim is easier and if its summer then it will be very hot out there.

The trailhead actually is outside the official park area, before you get to the gate. Fairyland is a nice, long hike, for which you'll want to make sure you have a minimum of 3 hours. It takes you down into the canyon, and it's a bit of a grade coming out, but not too difficult, and the views it yields will make it well worth your while. Make sure you don't miss Tower Bridge!

The last part of the Navajo loop, is strenuous but well worth it. My advise is to go at your own pace. What surprised me was the number of people we saw starting down these trails with little to no water. There are signs telling people to make sure to have plenty of water as there is none on the trails. If you go hiking in Bryce Canyon invest in a camelback or hydration pack.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"What a great place! There are lots of places to pull over and take pictures, and each overlook has different scenery. We went to the waterfall and cave (outside of the main park) and the Navajo Loop Trail. The waterfall and cave were kid friendly, and an easy, short walk. The Navajo Loop had sections that were easier, and others a little more strenuous, including switchbacks inside of a slot canyon. Both were heavily populated, but not enough to really detract from the overall experience. This may be an uncomfortable place for someone with a fear of heights, as there are lots of steep drop offs with no safety fencing. Bring good quality hiking boots or tennis shoes with high traction and support. Also dress in layers and pack water and a raincoat. When we arrived, the temp. (in August) was in the fifties with a heavy thunderstorm. Within 24 hours, it was sunny in the high 80s. This place is also known for stargazing, since there is virtually no light pollution at night, but it was too cloudy when we visited. There's a nice visitor center with a free movie and interactive exhibits to teach children about geology and wildlife. If you have to choose between going to the Grand Canyon or going to Bryce, I would choose Bryce. The views were just as good, and there seemed to be more things to do here.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited Bryce during a 16 day Utah/Arizona trip in which we went to over a dozen national parks and monuments. Bryce was the favorite for all the members of our family. The park was busy (as most were), but it didn't feel crowded. We first arrived about lunch time and stopped at one of the first picnic areas to eat lunch in a pleasant wooded area. After finishing I asked one of my daughters to walk down a nearby trail. We were both in awe as we crested a small hill and found ourselves at the rim looking down into the canyon. The hoodoos have an almost magical property to them. We had a great time hiking the Queens Garden/Navajo Loop trails (be sure to collect the benchmarks--the kids loved their ""I hiked the Hoodoos"" pin). We also booked the 3 hour/8 mile horse/mule ride with Canyon Trail Rides--an incredible way to enjoy the canyon.

I can't say enough about the beauty of the hoodoos under the sun, but even more at sunset. The variations in depth and color will take your breath away. There are a variety of trails for different levels. I hiked the short Sunrise to Sunset trail, only a 1/2 mile with my husband and St. Bernard. It takes you from one end of the rim to the other with unimpeded, jaw-dropping views. It's an easy, must-do hike that's paved. Navajo Trail is a 1.3 mile loop that drops down from Sunset Point and goes down into Bryce Amphitheater through a slot canyon. It's a bit strenuous both down and back up, but switch-backs make it doable. It was very popular and crowded. I almost always hike in my leather, Goretex boots, but there were all sorts in flip flops and sneakers, which I don't recommend, but to each his own. I saw my first ever rattlesnake on this trail. He posed no danger to the many hikers that walked passed all day long. I also hiked to Tower Bridge, a 3 mile round trip trail, which passes China Wall. I passed only a handful of people on this trail. It was pretty enough but the following day I was agog every minute on Peek-A-Boo loop. You could start at Bryce Point to do just the 5.5 mile loop, but I started at Sunset Point and did a figure-eight, along with Navajo Loop, which made for a fairly strenuous 7-mile hike through the heart of Bryce Amphitheater and past the Wall of Windows. I wanted to sign up to take one of the full moon hikes but was not selected during the lottery drawing for the 60 coveted spots. Here starts a few negatives about the Park. There are two full moon walks on two separate nights during the full moon in which participation by 60 people is selected by lottery. No one at Bryce Canyon Lodge (the place where the lottery takes place), or at the Visitor Center, could tell me anything about the hike, except that the lottery would be held at 4 p.m. at the lodge. They can't tell you what time, or which hike. The fact that I might already have done the intended full-moon hike might have eliminated my interest, and, therefore, I wouldn't have had to schedule my whole day around this 1 1/2-hour lottery process. Even at the lottery drawing you are not told when and where. They say that information is given out only to those selected so that a person couldn't just show up and tag along. I think it would make it more tourist friendly to monitor the group of hikers on the trail than to waste everyone's limited time. So first I wasted precious time at Bryce Canyon Lodge and the Visitor Center, as well as driving back and forth between them, and then I had to schedule my whole day around the 4 p.m. lottery. There were perhaps 150-175 people at the lottery drawing hoping for a spot. It's not until after everyone is seated, though, that they ask everyone to get back up and line up in the hall to have their individual footwear inspected for suitability before going back into the conference room. Why didn't they check our hiking shoes as we walked in the door in the first place? All-in-all, it's a very user unfriendly process. I also experienced incredibly unfriendly service from both a Park Ranger, who outright accused us of allowing our dog off the trail to do his business. Yes, we stood three feet off the trail to let others pass and to allow our 160 pound St. Bernard to sit in the shade of a tree for a minute to drink water. If he had done his business, I have bags visibly attached to the handle of his leash. His accusation was followed by a very condescending tirade about all the bad things tourists do in the Park. I also thought it was very very poor of the many service workers I asked about a particular hike, or directions within the park, only to be told they had no idea. Come on people. This is your home, and whether you're a waitress, or a Visitor Center cashier, you signed on to live and work in a National Park. It's your responsibility, and should be your pleasure, to know a bit about your surroundings. Or, do you just hate tourists, your job and life. In general, I found park service workers unfriendly, unenthusiastic and not very helpful.I also think it's about time more funds are given to the Parks, in general, to offer improved amenities, including cell towers and wifi service. Wouldn't it be nice if we could all get away without having to check in with the office, but the fact is, it's now possible to get away even more now with the ability to work from anywhere via phone and Internet. There were no electrical outlets within the park for public use to even charge a phone. Our National Parks are our heritage. I'm proud of the visionaries who had the foresight to protect and preserve them and make them accessible to all. They are a very cherished memory from my childhood, and so many other's childhood, that it's a disgrace the little money that is given them to offer the bare minimum of services, let alone improve upon them.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We only had a 1/2 day to spend at Bryce National Park, so we had to cut a lot of the ""to-do's off our ""to-do""list while there. That being said, it was most definitely an experience not to be missed! Although it was a sunny, mid-July day, the temperature was not unbearable at all. It was quite pleasant, in fact. As (unlike Zion, which we visited later on) you were able to bring your own vehice in the Park, after we passed through the gates (we had purchased the $80 Annual pass, as we were seeing a number of parks on our trip and that was the most economical option) we drove to, and parked at, Bryce Point. There was no problem finding a parking spot at about 10:45 am on a Tuesday in July. The first view of the Bryce hoodoos is absolutely breathtaking! I actually found it more beautiful (and most definitely more unique) than the Grand Canyon, which we had seen earlier in our trip. Just so unexpected, so not-of-this-world, so amazing! We took our time soaking up the view from Bryce Point, and then drove (and again, parked, without a problem) to Inspiration Point, where we spent some time walking to-and-from Inspiration Point and Upper Inspiration point; again, just soaking in the sites, taking zillions of photos, marveling at the natural beauty in front of us. Due to time constraints, our last stop was to drive to Sunset Point. Here there was a large visitor structure, where I assume restrooms and the like are located. It was much busier here than at the previous 2 lookouts we visited, but perhaps that is because it was now close to lunch time and the park was perhaps getting busier. We walked a bit of the Navajo Trail from here, though not for long as we did, unfortunately, need to leave. We will remember our time in the many photos we took, and already those we shared them with are planning their own trips there!","August 4, 2015",An amazing morning with incredible views and a great experience,368,"Ottawa, Canada",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"A day after touring Zion N.P., my wife and I toured Bryce Canyon National Park. Unlike Zion, personal autos were allowed on the main road inside the park. We started by driving directly to the furthest stop on the park road (Rainbow Point). We did stop along the road on the way in to observe and photograph several prong-horn sheep. After hiking the Bristlecone Loop Trail, we headed back toward the entrance, stopping for views, photographs, and some short walks at Black Birch Canyon, Agua Canyon, Natural Bridge and Farview Point. Natural Bridge was by far our favorite of these stops. We then stopped at Bryce Point, Inspiration Point and Sunset Point, all in the Bryce Amphitheater area. We then hiked from Sunset to Sunrise Point and a short way, maybe 1/4-mile, down into the Bryce Amphitheater area. After some photos, we climbed back up and hiked back to our car at Sunset Point. The views, colors and ""hoodoos"" in the Bryce Amphitheater area were nothing short of spectacular. Even as the day progressed, we were always able to find parking at the overlooks and trail heads. Since you mostly view Bryce from the canyon rim, you are at much higher elevations than in the bottom of Zion (8800 - 7600'), and there is a breeze; it was much more pleasant than Zion, only the day before. Both my wife and I thought Bryce Canyon was more impressive and more beautiful that Zion.","July 29, 2015",Absolutely Spectacular - Enjoyed more than more popular Zion N.P.,215,"Montgomery, Texas",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is by far the most unique national park I have visited. It is not as grand as the Grand Canyon, but it is unique. Breathtaking scenery and views. While using the shuttle is the best way to get around the lower section of the park, definitely take the trip in your car to the end of the park. In about 30 minutes, you rise to over 9000' elevation and even more spectacular views, particularly at the last stop. You can see plenty from the areas immediately adjacent to the parking lots, take the opportunity to take a hike on one or more of the trails and look back up at where you came from. A note of caution - you are 7000-9000' above sea level and the return trip on the trails (rated for difficulty on the park map) is uphill! The air is thin and the sun is strong!

In April there was still snow on the hoodoos, the temp was much cooler and not very crowded. The July visit was still cool in the morning but was fairly warm in the afternoon. On both trips, the best time for pictures was in the morning as the sun rose. The colors seemed to fade as the sun rose. The best hikes start in early in the morning. The trails begin to get busy later in the morning as the group tours arrive. I certainly will return to this park especially if I can visit in April or May before the crowds arrive.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is the second stop of my Canyons road trip from Phoenix to Vegas and back to Sedona. The first stop was at Antelope Canyon, which was amazing. For more on Antelope Canyon, read my review - Canyons Road Trip - First stop - Antelope Canyons.The drive from Antelope Canyons to Bryce is scenic and beautiful. The landscape changed from desert to more green. Although Bryce is gorgeous; for me, having just left Antelope Canyons, I was not as awed by it. In terms of breathtaking beauty, I would rank Bryce behind Antelope and Zion. Don't get me wrong, Bryce is still breathtakingly beautiful too and I would definitely suggest including it if you are on a road trip. For us, we stopped by Bryce for about 3-4 hours on our way from Page to Zion and did not stay overnight. TIPS (Note: we are retirees and not the very athletic type)1. Include Bryce in your road trip from Antelope Canyons to Zion. It is only 2.5 hours from Page and around 2 hrs from Zion National Park.2. For foodies - Be aware that there are not that many great places to eat at Bryce and it is quite expensive so manage your expectations3. Entrance Fee for cars - $30, valid for 7 days so you can come back another day if you want4. If you are only stopping by for a few hours and not staying overnight, try to get there between 8am-7pm if you want to use the shuttle; otherwise, use the map provided at entry to drive and stop at your own pace at the famous viewpoints such as Bryce, Inspiration, Sunset, and Sunrise.5. We took about 3-4 hours to drive and stop at the four viewpoints above. We took a longer break to walk up Inspiration Point. Allow for 1/2 hour extra if you want to watch the film at the visitor center. We missed the show due to time constraints.6. If you want to do a short hike of about 1 mile, you can do that at Bristlecone Loop trail.We did not hike but the walk up to top of Inspiration Point was enough for us. The view of the Hoodoo is worth it.7. Just be aware: the crows here are not scared of humans8.

The photos you see on Flickr or Google are exactly what it looks like.We took a half day horse ride down into the amphitheatre, which is simply the best way to see the Hoodoos close up and get a feel for the scale of the whole thing.Remember, Bryce is quite high, so rain can be a problem - make sure you get the best of the morning before the afternoon clouds up. Greatest views of the amphitheatre are from Bryce Point, but don't forget Yovimpa right at the end of the road for a fantastic far view back towards Grand Canyon, and a reverse view of the Grand Staircase.I will let you photographers into a secret. Dawn is great. Get there at least 30 minutes before sunrise to get a good place (it fills up fast in season). But stay for a while after the others have left. About 45 minutes to 1 hour after sunrise, the morning light is reflected _back_ onto the Hoodoos giving a magical soft light to everything. Don't miss it.I give this just 4 out of 5 because it is a one-trick pony - see the Hoodoos, and you are largely done.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We really enjoyed Bryce and it was quite a change from the crowds at Zion. Perfect weather in July! We did the Queens Garden Trail, Navajo Loop and wall street. Gorgeous at sunrise, not as great at sunset b/c the sun is setting behind the rim so it just casts pretty harsh shadows. I love how you can walk right out from the lodge to the rim and there are a bunch of benches to sit on and enjoy the view. The close proximity was wonderful since we stayed in the lodge, we just made coffee in our room and took the cups with us out to the rim to catch sunrise :)","July 21, 2015","Beautiful, fairly quiet park",11,"San Antonio, Texas",5

Our host the night before had suggested we drive all the way to Rainbow Point at the end of the scenic drive and then visit the sights on our way back. This worked well for us. We beat some of the crowd. By the time we got back to the beginning of the drive some of the heaviest traffic had passed. The Hoodoos are unique, standing sentry row upon row. You won't see it to the same extent anywhere else. We came back the next morning for a quick hike on the Navajo Loop Trail. It's a new way of experiencing the hoodoos - from the canyon bottom. It is a climb back to the top, though! ","July 21, 2015",Beautiful sights unique to Bryce,37,"Bellevue, Nebraska",4

It had always been a sore spot with me. This time, I hiked the Navajo Loop and Queen's Garden (I left a review for that one), and we drove the length of the park to Rainbow Point. We ate dinner at the Lodge and the food was very good (This park is NOT run by Xantera, so the food and service was very good). While shopping in the gift store, we struck up a conversation with a park employee (someone in charge of housekeeping). He offered to show us their newly refurnished cabins.

We did take advantage of the shuttle system, and it wasn't as good as Zion's. We had to wait much longer at the stops; one time, we had to wait 20-30 minutes.

It is straight down into the canyon and then straight up to get out of the canyon. But you can plan to take time and go slow if you need to.

We prefer going clockwise from Sunrise point - easier coming up Sunset point (fewer switchbacks). The rim trail is also nice - good views. We did one of the Geology tours and learned a lot about how the canyon formed and the whole area. We also made sure to drive to the other overlooks to get different views of the canyon.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We arrived to Bryce via the free shuttle from Ruby's Inn. (We previously purchased a National Park Pass for $80, so the fee entrance fee was included-Don't forget your pass!).  We stopped at the visitors center to ask about 'easy' hikes. The ranger suggested the Rim Trail from Bryce Point. We accidentally started walking the 'Under the Rim' trail and quickly retraced our steps, although very scenic and easy but our accidental hike took up 3/4 of mile worth of hiking. The 'amphitheater' boosts stunning views of the hoodoo's and pictures surely do not do it justice. We ventured on the rim trail and were absolutely mesmerized! Sunset Point offers a moderate hike for 1.3 miles on the Navajo Loop. Well, let me tell ya,....it's not that easy but definitely doable. The terrain is steep with loose gravel but the views are amazing so this makes up for the tiring climb. Definitely muster up your strength and courage to do this!! We did not venture any further from the loop since the 1.3 mile hike was enough for us. Bring plenty of water, sandwiches and good walking shoes.

We did camp, and while the temperatures made it comfortable, be aware that the campground that we stayed in (the one right by the entrance) was extremely covered in bugs. However, don't let that deter you. The place was amazing and truly a stunning sight to behold.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We drove up from Zion the night before and only had one day to spend in Bryce. It can be done! Bryce is amazingly beautiful and a must stop if in he area...do not skip it! The only problem here is lack of hotels and restaurants. I think all three restaurants in the area are ones by he same people and it was not good - see review on Ruby's. Now all the positives! Bryce is breathtakingly beautiful. We have been to Zion, Sedona, Grand Cayon, Yosemite, Colorado, Alaska etc. and Bryce is at the very top. Every view will take amaze and inspire you. We entered the park and stopped off at the Visitors Center. At first we were disappointed as it rained heavily overnight and were told the trails were very muddy and not recommended. They also have a tram, like Zion, but do not run as frequent and were not needed when we went. If there were more and ran as frequent as Zion, we would have rode them. We drive up to the first view point, Sunrise Point. We were pleased to see the ground had soaked up most of the water and the trails were wet, but firm. Additionally, the rain brought out all the colors in the rock! There were intermittent showers through the day that continued to bring out the colors and provide amazing partly cloudy skies for pictures. At Sunrise we hiked down to the Queens Garden then caught the connecting Navajo Lodge trail back up to Sunset Point. We took the inside/east trail (there are two as it is a loop) going back UP (very steep) in order to see Thor's Hammer. We continued on and stopped at every view point to Bryce Point. We then drove back 2 miles and picked up the road to Rainbow Point. This is a 16 mile drive with several view points that does not have tram access...you must drive or take one of the two (one morning, one afternoon) free ranger guided bus tours. This was our first time at Bryce and wanted to share our experience with others debating a visit to Bryce for the day...do it! although steep, we found the trails evenly packed and did not need our trekking poles. Reminder, Bryce is at 8000 feet elevation and it gets cold up there...our high was 64 the day we went...bring warm cloths and layer as the temperature fluctuated thought the day due to a mix of sunshine, clouds, and rain. Photo opportunities are endless and you will not be disappointed. We spent a good 8 hours in the park before heading back down to Mt. Carmel Junction for the night. The.

With our handicap placard, we got lucky and found a stop just outside the Information Center. We hopped on the shuttle and headed to the end of the run and took a hike on the paved path to the narrows. I wish we had enough time to see the other spots within the park, but feet were already sore and the required hiking wasn't within our time frame or our remaining foot power.We drove out the east end of the park which was a great choice as there was so much to see heading that direction (just east of the park is when we spotted the buffalos!).The trip is so worth your time!Enjoy!!!","July 9, 2015",Absolutely beautiful!,127,"Torrance, California",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,We read a lot about parking and to use the shuttle service. We arrived late in the afternoon and decided to drive ourselves to see what we could see and use the shuttle the next morning. It turns out that parking was not a problem at all and we were able to visit all of our places of interest. We would strongly recommend that you visit the south end of the park as many people do not venture there. There is limited parking but since there are mostly overlooks and viewpoints most people don't stay long. We had no problem parking.,"July 8, 2015",Scenic overlooks,70,Michigan,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We loved everything about this national park. Our first day we hiked the Navajo/Queens Garden Loop, which allowed us to fully experience the Canyon safely. It gave us enough of a challenge to say ""Yea, we did it!"" The hoodoos are spectacular. In the afternoon we hiked the rim trail from Bryce Point to Sunset Point, which was an easier, yet scenic trail. The second day we took the Rainbow Point bus tour. Our guide/bus driver Jay was excellent with a great sense of humor and he even managed to make the tour fun despite the fog we encountered that prevented us from seeing most of the scenery on the tour. He recommended we check out the Mossy Cave trail, which we're glad we did. Very few people on the trail, which leads to a beautiful waterfall. Out of the national parks we visited on this trip (Arches, Bryce, Zion & Grand Canyon North Rim), Bryce was our favorite because we felt it was the most engaging & interactive for our family.

Bryce Canyon National Park,This park was 5 minutes from where we camped. Busy but not TOO busy. Loved the ease of driving or taking the shuttle. The visitor center was helpful if you got there early - packed in the late morning until close. Take the scenic drive all the way to the end and then take the offshoots to see the gems hidden in the canyons. BEAUTIFUL! Sunrise and sunset are just amazing. The night views breathtaking. Several great hikes. The weather at this park is perfect. Low 80's during the day and mid-40's at night. Don't take the nature/wildlife trails - there isn't much nature or wildlife - if at all. You will see more wildlife when you drive into and out of the park at sunrise and dusk then any of these hikes have to offer. ,"July 8, 2015",My favorite park of the Fab 5,34,CYPRESS,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is a beautiful, serene place . . . of all the NPs in the area (Canyonlands, Zion, Cedar Breaks, Grand Canyon), this one is one of my favorites. The size and the amount of visitors is comfortable, not overwhelming. The views are to die for and are beautiful from so many viewpoints and perspectives! I love hiking down into the canyon and being amongst the hoodoos - it's tranquil and amazing, nothing like it!! You'll want to take a million photos, it's truly that beautiful. I'd recommend the Navajo or Tower Bridge trails, both take you into the canyon and present gorgeous views. The facilities are also really nice here . . . we typically camp at North or Sunset and both are great facilites. The Visitor's Center, Lodge and General Store are also nice places to stop in. We haven't taken the shuttle as we like the drive, but many people do! Water is available at the visitors center and showers at the General Store.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"It's spectacular. We were just doing a ""drive by"". You don't see the canyon until you park and walk a short distance to the overlooks. Looks like hiking or mule riding among the canyon formations would be an awesome day. Still a great ""drive by"" excursion, but Zion is much better if you are simply driving through since it essentially has a car trail through it while Bryce does not. In the summer, worth noting that Bryce is meaningfully cooler than Zion, so might be a better day-long hiking experience where you would be in the 80's vice 100's. Stay in Springdale, drive through Zion first thing in the morning, hike Bryce during the day.","July 7, 2015",Best if you have time to hike,90,"Long Beach, California",5

Absolutely beautiful collection of great viewpoints (for those of us reluctant to hike too much) and plenty of breathtaking trails for the brave hiking folks. And don't be surprised if you are accompanied with a deer or two on your visit to the edges. Just stay quiet and take as many pictures as you can, from both of the view and the animals. The crows of the park are also up for a great selfie, but please be cautious, they can be dangerous if you get too close.

It's so amazingly beautiful and whimsical in a way that it makes me laugh with delight. I was there in early July with my specially abled brother. He managed the Navajo/Queens Garden loop just fine, albeit slowly. Take plenty of water.

There was so much beauty to see every where, like a natural fairyland with towering spires and pink sand. Even though many creations had names we also made our own names for those that didn't.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I go to Bryce Canyon almost every year. But the last time we took the half day mule ride. What a great experience. I'd chose the early ride that leaves at 8am. You'll get back at around 11:30am or later. You avoid the thunderstorms that way, it's cooler and the sun is at the right angle for great pictures. About an 8 mile loop. Price is reasonable too.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Went to Zion first and then on to Bryce. The road goes through Dixie National Forest before one enters Bryce and I thought that drive was more awe inspiring than Bryce itself. The road through Bryce is filled with evergreen trees on both sides and you need to get out of your car at the pull outs and view the formations from the edge of them. There are no roads through the rocks themselves. That was disappointing. ,"July 4, 2015",Zion was better.,3,"Boise, Idaho",4
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We drove up from Zion to hike Bryce for a day so I cannot comment on camping, lodging, etc. We parked right outside the park and took the shuttle bus into the park. While the shuttle bus was convenient, it was not as convenient as Zion as it doesn't run in two directions. However, it was clean, reliable and better than driving and finding parking.We got off first at Sunrise Point and all I can say when you walk to the canyon for the first time is that it totally jaw dropping. The formations, called hoodoos, are so otherworldly looking. We hiked the Navajo Loop/Queens Garden loops first and the descent into the valley is definitely remarkable on this trail. It is a bit crowded as it is only a moderate hike and the most popular route. After this hike, we walked over to the lodge and general store and grabbed some snacks. My wife and 13 & 10 year old went to the visitor center, on some short hikes and a ranger tour on rim trail, while I hiked the Peekaboo loop and full Rim trail with my 16 year old son. The Peekaboo loop starts at Bryce Point and is a pretty strenuous hike of 5.5 miles and an elevation change of 1571 feet. It was a great tough hike, not crowded at all and with tons of great views across many switchbacks. It briefly rained during our hike so the footing got a bit tough. The only other thing to be careful about on this loop is the horse droppings. It is also part of a horse trail and there are plentiful amounts of dung on the route. Rim Trail is very easy, much of it paved and great viewing points from Bryce Point to Inspiration Point, Sunrise Point and Sunset Point. One benefit of Bryce over Zion are the cooler temperatures so while there are plenty of tough hikes, the heat does not become overwhelming. I'd highly recommend the park for a visit, it is an inspiring and surreal spot and just jaw dropping in terms of the natural beauty. As far as National Parks go, it is on the smaller side so you can get a fair amount done and seen in just a single day, although certainly enjoy the park even more if you are there for multiple days.","July 4, 2015",Jaw Dropping,50,"Bellevue, Washington",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,Visit this National park if you find yourself in the area. The scenery is stunning and each stop is more awe inspiring then the last.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Possibly my favourite of the Utah ""Big 5"" parks - just amazing views and sights from start to finish.As every guide book will tell you, one of the 3 mile hikes is close to the best in the world, and it would be hard to argue with that view. Start at Sunrise Point (whatever time of day you visit) and walk down to the canyon floor, and keep following the path through the trail.Don't loop back and return to the start point, you will still have walked the same distance, and don't take the first route up to Sunset Point.Follow the path called ""Wall Street"".This route means you walk down a wide and gradual descent to the base, with excellent views, but in almost total direct sunshine. Walking up through Wall Street is through a ""slot canyon"" so is well over 50% in shade all day and therefore a lot cooler, and it is an easier walk up.The overall route is ""moderate"" in my opinion - as long as you have mobility and plenty of water it is quite straight forward to complete, and the sense of wonder is only matched by the sense of achievement.Truly the best morning of our trip to the US this year - worth going to Utah for just to do this walk!","July 3, 2015",Amazing & wonderful place,128,"Coleford, United Kingdom",5

As for our group site, it was awesome! The site has partial shade during the day and best of all a brand new bathroom (with a special space for cleaning camping dishes that has HOT water).

It really makes a difference to go early as we arrived right at 8 am and there were no other cars. We had no trouble parking at any of the sites and the crowds were not too bad. Even if time is limited, it is worth driving all the way through to Rainbow Point as the views there were spectacular.

On the tour, our stops included the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, Niagara Falls... and this. And as such, I wasn't particularly excited to visit. However this place is more amazing than it sounds. You don't tire of taking photos of it or looking out at the red rock. It really is fantastic, and no picture can do it justice.There is a walk down into the canyon (I think it's called the Navajo trail) - my husband said it was phenomenal to walk down, but it is for the more fit people, he agreed that I wouldn't have been able to do it (I'm of the large, breathless, arthritic sort!)

Bryce Canyon National Park,The first time I walked to the edge of the canyon and looked over I was amazed. I was at a loss for words... could not believe the beauty. If you are a hiker - and especially if you have kids - check with the visitor center on the 'I Hiked the Hoodoos' program. When you hike to and take a picture of three of the many markers in the park you take those pictures or etchings to the visitor center for a commemorative pin. We don't have kids but we enjoyed it - we were hiking anyway so it was another reward for our hard work. Should be loads of fun for the kids.,"June 30, 2015",The view are like no other !,7,FLORIDA,5

I did a same-day visit from Las Vegas; provided you wake up and depart early from your hotel, same-day visits out of Vegas are possible (do not forget about the one hour time zone change when scheduling your trip). Bring water with you, comfortable sports shoes, and a waterproof bag for your camera(s) in case the weather turns to rain on a moments notice. The latter happened to me on 2015-Jun-27 (Saturday). Rain showered for 30 minutes when I was there, but it was for the best; not only did it cool the temperature, but the rain helped the canyon's colours radiate and stand out more, which made for better photographs (see attached).","June 29, 2015",More enjoyable than the Grand Canyon!,5,"Vancouver, Canada",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I was going to miss this one in Utah, because I only have 12 days for my planned road trip. I am glad that I did not. The amphitheaters of Bryce Canyon National Park is something, made by millions of years of wind, water and geologic mayhem that formed all these giant hoodoos (a tall, thin spire of rock that protrudes from the bottom of an arid drainage basin or badland) is simply amazing!. The nice thing about this park is that if you are not mobile enough to hike the trials, you can take shuttle bus to each view point to admire the view. I took the option to hike, you see so much more by in the middle of it. There are many hiking trails and in the utah.com site, there is a national park section where you can go to each national park and then look for sample itineraries, accommodation...etc. The itineraries also have a motor one....for people who wanted to drive and see the scenery. There is shuttle bus to get around the park to different view points and trial heads, but you can drive, it is not compulsory like in Zion (during summer months). My experience in looking for accommodation is not easy, most chain hotels were fully booked and I ended up in a B & B (may be because it was a last minute trip, not last last minute, a couple of weeks of planning). It was ok, since I am hiking during the day. The scene is amazing. Go for it.","June 28, 2015","Amazing scenery formed by milions of years of wind, water and geologic magic!",195,"Brooklyn, New York",4

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Visited here in late June. Park was a little crowded but if you start early, before 8:00am, no problems. If you don't want to deal with the elevation changes involved with descending into the canyon do the rim trail. Over a couple different days we hiked the entire rim from Bryce Point to Fairyland Point. I would also recommend doing the hike in that order. If you Want to go into the canyon the easiest route is from Sunset Point down to Queens Garden and back up. Going down this way is easy but back up can be challenging if you aren't acclimated to the 9200 foot altitude. The rim trail is fairly easy and offers magnificent views. It is amazing how every few feet you walk the hoodoos and scenery change. Enjoy!!!","June 28, 2015",A don't miss sight.,72,,5

Not knowing if the weather would worsen or improve, we decided to drive the park's paved roadway to the overview sights. One can get a very good sense of the beauty of Bryce Canyon just by doing this.  Be prepared for changes in the weather. While the sun did come out for quite awhile on the day we visited, rain, thunder and lightning returned later in the day. In early June, the temperature hovered in the mid-40s. At the park's high elevations, (Rainbow Point is over 9,100 feet above sea level) the winds can be fierce and cold.

Outside of Bryce… the city is SO small and you are SO far away from things… it's fun for a night but not longer. The park is small. You basically ride through… stop and pullovers and walk 50 feet to take a picture and you are done. You've GOT to hike to get down below if you want to experience this park. The altitude is much higher (close to or at 9,000 feet) so just be aware of that. That wasn't a problem for us… but saw some that it was. There was still snow on the ground at the very end of April.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We were traveling between Grand Canyon and Grand Tetons and discovered Bryce Canyon was on the line of travel. We added a day to allow a visit to Bryce. The landscape was unique to say the least. Simple to see whether you wish to hike or not. Plenty of trails to hike all well marked, from long to short trails. In our case time did no permit us to take the longer trails but we were able to take some of the shorter ones into the canyon for another vantage point of the hoodoos. If hiking is not what you are looking for, the scenic turnouts offer plenty of views from many different angles to appreciate how different sunlight plays on the canyon. Be ready to take plenty of photos as there is nothing quite like it. Breathtaking!! The scenic drive takes around 1 1/2 hours depending on how long you spend at each stop. You can see the whole thing in 3 hours easily but you will want to spend more time if you have it. There is wildlife in the area in the mornings/evenings. We took the route from visitors center to Bryce Point (stop at all turnouts). If you have time return from Bryce Point and take the main drag south all the way to Rainbow Point (Swamp Canyon, Whiteman Bench, Natural Bridge and Rainbow Points in particular). Sunset Point for great pics at sunset (obviously). If you have time to hike, remember the altitude. Bring plenty of water.

We appreciated the MANY places to easily refill water bottles and hydration packs and the clearly marked, well maintained paths/trails. This was a fun day trip for our family. We did love the views of the hoodoos, but we also took the ""mossy cave"" hike and stumbled on an off shoot to a waterfall (it is marked on the trail to mossy cave, but we didn't see it on our map).

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Spent one day at Bryce Canyon while we were camping at Zion National Park, about 85 miles south. If you can do only ONE hike at Bryce and you're up for some adventure that is moderate in difficulty, the Fairyland Loop is IT. First, a park ""hack:"" You need not pay to get in the park to hike this AMAZING trail -- probably one of the BEST I've ever done. No cheating here, this is just how the park is set up and I feel quite sure that if the NPS wanted to keep you from doing it, they'd have fixed it by now. But here it is: On the way into the park, on the left is an entrance to the Fairlyland view (or overlook). This is before you get to the park entrance shack where you pay the $25 entrance fee. This is less popular than the Sunrise trailhead, so the parking there is usually available. Since the trail is a loop, you can get on the trail there, skip the park entrance fee, and on your way around the trail, you can still visit the Visitor Center near Sunrise point, if you want. It's a short walk.That being said, here's the basics: The trail is 8.4 miles of up and down, which is probably why it is listed as ""strenuous"" by the park system. But, really, the ""up"" is not that steep...more gradual than other places we've hiked where ""strenuous"" mean steep. If you're in reasonably good shape, you'll be fine. Take 4 or 5 bottles of water and you'll be fine. Please don't be that hiker in flip flops, no sunscreen, and only one 16.9 oz. bottle of water to last you 4 to 5 hours. I wore trail-running shoes, not my usual hiking boots, which is fine. Be smart. Set yourself up to ENJOY this hike!How long does it take? We did the hike in 3:40 minutes with a lunch break and my snapping lots of pictures. The paths are 90% dirt path / road quality. There are a few places where some gravel and rocks make you watch your step, but, seriously, if you had the skill, you could ride a unicycle along these paths.To get on the trail, whether you start at the Fairyland view (outside the park entrance) or at Sunrise Point, my advice is go COUNTERCLOCKWISE on the trail. You'll see the same stuff, but, what you see by going this direction is all in front of you, rather than behind you...you won't have to turn around to see it. It's amazing! At the Sunrise Point trailhead, you have to start to your left for both directions, but there is a brown sign that points to Fairyland Loop (see pictures) and seems to go downhill. THAT is the one you want. NOT the trail that goes uphill. The uphill goes clockwise, the ""downhill"" goes counterclockwise. There is a sign with a brass marker. Take a picture of the marker. Collect pictures of two of the three markers and go to the Information Desk at the visitor center after you're done and they'll give you a cool hat pin that says ""I hiked the Hoodoos!"" It's pretty cool. A second marker is at Tower Bridge, a short hike (200 yards) off the Fairyland Loop down in the canyon. The third is near the Fairyland Viewpoint, near the end of the hike (going CCW), or at the beginning if you go clockwise.Either way you go will be awesome, but we noticed that had we gone clockwise, we'd have to turn around a lot to see what we were seeing as we walked in the direction we were going. Simply amazing. Bryce Canyon's Hoodoos on the Fairyland Loop are some of the most amazing things I've ever seen. The beauty there makes this hike one of the best I've ever been on -- I've hiked Arches National Park, Zion, Big Bend, Yosemite, now Bryce and a few others, but this takes the cake. If you're a photographer and have a choice of cameras, bring your ""good"" camera. I took my Canon G15 instead of my Canon 5D MkIII. BIG mistake. Great shots, but, could be so much better with the full-frame digital.Lastly, again, don't forget to take lots of water, snacks (trail mix, beef jerky, hard candy?), and sunscreen. Wear a daypack. Don't let your basic survival needs go ignored; you want to be able to FULLY enjoy this STUNNING and majestic place.Feel free to message me if you have a specific question.

The tour is free but you must reserve your spot no more than 24 hours in advance. The tour is 3 1/2 hours long. I recommend the tour. In the afternoon we went hiking from sunrise to sunset.

From the visitor center, you take a scenic drive (along with all the other tourists). The speed limit is low to allow people to stop and gape at the incredible views. We took the strategy of driving to the end of the road (Rainbow Point), ooed and awed, at our picnic lunch, and then drove back stopping at the other view points along the way. This worked well since the view points are all on the right side of the road heading back and thus easy to get to/from without having to cross traffic.","June 16, 2015",Stunning beyond words,114,"Sacramento, California",5

The colors change with the sun as the day progresses and looking up at the sky through the maze of hoodoos in the valley make for terrific pictures. Hint: Stop at the Visitor's Center and ask the Ranger a few key questions: Which viewpoints lend themselves to am or pm priority? Which hiking trails best meet your particular needs...easy, moderate? If you are going to do a loop trail is one way preferred over another? These questions are key to making your trip OK to sensational. When taking pictures use your zoom lens to center on one or a a small group of hoodoos. It will make them more interesting to view later.

Use your imagination to see things like Snoopy, a rabbit, poodle, stone people, etc. Simply magical! Many hiking trails, but just remember that it is pretty easy going down, but you're going to have to come back up at some point!Because private cars and the regular shuttles aren't allowed in the last third or so of the park, I recommend catching the free Rainbow Tour (which you can pick up at one of several stops), and either seeing all of the park, or just the inaccessible part. Our guide and driver, Jay, was a wonderful commentator and a real fount of information about trees, formations, history, etc. The stops weren't rushed at all.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I was with a coach tour of fifty people who stopped at Bryce Canyon late afternoon. We were spellbound by the sight of so many hoodoos ( a new word for us all) The sun was low, casting shadows, which really gave depth to the vision of all those rock formations. On this trip we stayed on the rim and took photographs. Some of us walked up to a higher view point reached by a paved path. The altitude here is 8-9,000 feet so the air is thin, I struggled to breathe and I'm very fit. My husband,who has a heart condition, sat on the many seats provided.We came back on the sunny Sunday morning, when there was a different light. While some of our party followed the trail down to the floor of the canyon which took 1 1/2 hours, three of us sat on a log seat and ""put the world to rights"".

One short hike led away from the canyon through the Ponderosa pines--it was quiet, relaxing and perfect. Crowds congregate at the canyon edges, close to the parking lots. But move deeper into the hiking paths and, though there are still hikers, it isn't usually crowded. The second hike was the Navajo Loop Trail, not a long hike but possibly one of the most spectacular hikes I've taken. It just feels good to walk surrounded by the tall red walls, to see the lone Ponderosa pines stretching up to the sky to reach the light, to walk through the canyon, to see the light playing with the warm colors ... .

Bryce Canyon National Park,"The park literature passed out at the main entry does not provide any information or advice on how visitors should tour the park or information about the campgrounds. A few words about canyon rim parking and short trails to view the canyon (particularly about handicap access) would have been extremely helpful.My wife and I spent many hours trying to negotiate RECREATION.GOV to reserve a campsite at Bryce Canyon National Park; we use an 18' travel trailer. The website was frequently unresponsive and when it was working identified some campsites as ""reserved"" and a lot of sites as ""first-come / first-served."" We never did find a site we could reserve and ended up staying at a KOA in Cannonville. When we visited the park, the two rangers at the Visitor's Center would answer no questions regarding camping facilities and merely directed us to the campground across the street. There are no staff manning the campgrounds and merely a message board and instructions on how to pay for your campsite. It turned out that all of the ""first-come / first-served"" sites are for tents only and do not have the space for a motor home or a travel trailer and tow vehicle. It would have been nice if RECREATION.GOV had pointed out that fact. All of the reserveable RV/Trailer sites are already reserved for the entire summer!While touring the park, we found that little to no effort had been directed toward placing signs to assist visitors to Sunrise Point; the same may have been true at Sunset Point too. The parking area is identified simply as ""Sunrise Point Unit 1"" and has several unmarked gravel trails leading toward the canyon rim. We had to drive by several times before realizing this was where we were supposed to park and then ventured down a trail that led us to some stables (which had also not been marked with signs). The parking area at Inspiration Point and also at Bryce Point were right at the canyon rim and did not need additional signage; of all the places we stopped, however, only one of these or the other was handicap accessible, the other as well as Sunrise Point and Sunset Point were not.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This experience is etched in our brains and hearts forever! As Seniors, we weren't going to hike trails but to photgraph Bryce Canyon in all its glory. Words can't adequately describe how breathtaking the salmon colored ""hoodoos"" (canyon spires) are and the vastness they extend. Bryce Canyon Lodge provided info on sunrise and sunset times. We got up to capture sunrise over the South rim, by a path next to the Lodge's motel rooms (even though we called way ahead, we got the last room available). As we waited for 6:13am sunrise, it became extremely cold and windy (come prepared with loads of layers!) as the sun was caught behind clouds. Finally, around 7am, our first glimpse of the hoodoos came into view and we were awe struck! It was almost a religious experience as we caught birds soaring on thermals between them and glimpsed ant-sized hikers wind through the serpentine trails below. Then, we shuttled to many of the stops, walking the doable main paths for Kodak moments. If needed, buy your supplies at near by Bryce City's ""Ruby's Inn General store"", where we mailed gifts at their convenient post office ( if a weekend, you can purchase stamps and drop off postcards in mail slots).

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce is an amazing place and one of the national parks that can be enjoyed by all. Even if you are wheel-chair bound you can enjoy the amazing views from the dozen or so scenic overlooks. If you want to do some ""horizontal hiking"" (aka light hiking) there are paths along the rim that get you away from the crowds and even better views. If you want to do some ""real"" hiking there are all manner of trails for every level of difficulty. Bryce is best viewed in the light of the first half of the day since the scenic road runs along the west side of the canyon. After about 3pm the sun is behind you and the lighting is all wonky. So for the best experience get up early for sunrise, and then drive all the way to the end of the scenic drive and make stops at all the overlooks on the drive back. For the best experience in the park book lodging inside the park too (although there are not many rooms, they may have a cancellation so you can always check back on the day of your arrival).","June 6, 2015",Nothing like it on earth,81,"Tulsa, Oklahoma",5

We did about 7-8 miles on the Navajo, peekaboo, and queens garden trails which were all great.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon was our second stop on a tour of the national parks of Utah. Before taking a tour we stopped at the visitor center to obtain information on the park and the best way to tour the area. You will want to watch the film before starting your tour. It will help you understand what you are seeing and what a hoodoo is. One of the park rangers told us if we took the free shuttle we would not need to drive our car and that would keep us from searching for a place to park at the overlooks. What he failed to tell us was that the shuttle does not cover the entire park. It will take you to Bryce Point and Inspiration Point but not to the end of the road where you will find some of the most beautiful areas in the park. The only shuttles that go to the end are by reservation only, and book up quickly. After we rode the shuttle in a circle we still got in the car and drove to the end. If you want to ride the shuttle that goes all the way to the end of the park be sure to make reservations. I got off at Bryce Point and walked the trail back to Inspiration Point. You can do this walk in either direction since the shuttle goes in a circle. I highly recommend taking this trail. It is a fairly easy walk of about one mile and the scenery is stunning. On one side are hoodoos and spires and on the other is valleys and mountains. You can cover the park in about 3 hours, depending on traffic.","June 5, 2015",Awesome Beauty,61,"Nashville, Tennessee",5

It was cooler than I thought at night so bring a light jacket even in August. We saw a few pronghorn. very cool. plus mule deer, loads of chipmunks and lovely birds.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"""Picturesque"" doesn't quite sum it up. ""Amazing"", ""otherworldly"", ""unique""... Throw all these elements together and you're getting closer to describing Bryce Canyon. Definitely worth an overnight detour from Lake Powell or Zion trips. The hikes aren't overly strenuous and are unspeakably beautiful, particularly the Navajo/Queens Garden loop trail. If you're all about getting the best possible photos from your travels, sunrise shots from Inspiration Point will for sure make your friends jealous. There are plenty of inns just outside the park, but if you want to camp in Bryce you really need to get there as early in the morning as possible. Campgrounds are first-come-first-serve and fill up incredibly fast.

For the time of year we traveled, it was best for us to drive into the park and take the shuttle inside the park for the local scenic points. We then drove out to Rainbow Point, which is only accessible by bus twice a day. The weather was cool, so need to bring a jacket. As the title states, the views were amazing. Saw a film at the visitor center about how the hoodoos were formed. The only thing we missed was being able to hike down into the canyon to look up at the spires.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Bryce Canyon is a must from all national parks. You will take hundreds of pictures. Best time is early in the morning when the sun is not that strong and the tourist buses have not arrived yet. We walked Queen's Garden which took us about 2 hours because we are picture crazy. Some people get up to see the sunrise but we got there by 8:30 AM and there were few people. In May it is still quite cold (50-60 degrees) so dress in layers. In the canyon the temperature will go up.

It was fun. We enjoyed the views both from above and below. The colors of the rocks and the shadows that the sun casts make for some interesting pictures. I guess we were there during the peak season (May), I don't know, but there were people at every view point, on every trail and everywhere you looked. The weather was perfect for hiking. The scenic drive was worth the trip and all the view points offered something different. Don't forget to explore the Prairie Dog area. I love to watch them.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Colors - the very first thing that should come into one's mind when he/she visit Bryce. There's red, orange, yellow, vermillion, green almost everywhere. The difference of Bryce with other canyons like Grand Canyon and others is that, walking/hiking in Bryce is really easy. Bryce being mostly 8000 ft above sea level, the weather changes from time to time. For example, in our case it was thunderstorms one day and perfectly sunny to cloudy on the other day. Ample parking spots in all of the points and then there's shuttle service as well. Try not to park in the visitor's area (as it is a one hour dedicated parking and more than that you'd get tickets, I saw the sheriff handing out tickets to a few.) There's parking just crossing the visitors area and if that's full go to any one of the scenic points and park. If you prefer hiking, then hike to another point or you can also take the shuttle.","June 2, 2015",Colorful,35,,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Words and pictures do no justice to this place - it is one magical place to be experienced and immersed into! One could sit on a bench at the Rim, or anywhere and enjoy the scenery - and what a view that you could see forever, as the air is so clear. But the view changes as the sun rises and sets, casting shadows in some places, reflecting the different hues of red in others. In my imagination, it almost seems like the hoodoos are the creation of some kid's playtime with playdough - each hoodoo uniquely different from the other.In terms of length of stay, obviously one could stay for a long time here - it is so beautiful but 2 days, 1 night, 3 days 2 nights should be adequate for the basic hikes to enjoy most of this park. It is a relatively small park. There is a recommended drive to Rainbow Pt etc (about 9 stops in a 20 mile drive) - unless one wants to hike there, the drive and stop should not take more than 1.5 hrs - not much in comparison to the core amphitheater. Also, if you get a chance to, do take the horse/mule ride down to the valley floor - it is one magical ride and well worth the time/money ($80 for a 3-4 hrs ride) - besides the horse/mule is doing the work hiking down and up the valley!","June 2, 2015",God's magical creation - so beautiful!,224,"San Jose, California",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is not a particularly large park but it is spectacular. The geology and landscape is incredible and inspiring. The park has a great layout that makes it very easy to do a scenic drive in as much time as you'd like, or you can take a shuttle that goes to all the viewpoints along the way. You can make as many or as few stops as you like and most of the viewpoints, located very close to the road, have walks or trails of varying length. There are not tons of parking spaces at many viewpoints with a few exceptions so the shuttle is probably a great option when it's very crowded in the park. Bryce is different from Zion but equally lovely, and I'm very glad I visited both parks as well as Grand-Staircase Escalante because I felt they all offered different things. If you drive to Escalante, check out the short trail into hoodoos and a small waterfall near Tropic.

From our Fairyland Canyon find to the 3.5-hour Rainbow Point Tour bus, we found the hoodoos fascinating. We are not in condition to do any big hikes, but were able to go to all of the viewpoints by using the shuttle and bus tour (which is free). At every viewpoint, the vistas are amazing, and by walking just 20 feet to the right or left, you were bound to see something from a new perspective. The first day, we were blessed with sun and the frequent clouds that give the amphitheaters depth and shadows. We stayed in the Sunrise Point building and woke up in the morning to major fog.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon, at 56 square miles the tiniest of the 'rock groups' in Utah, is so awe-inspiring at first glance that we truly had no verbal response for hours. We looked over its rim, picked up our hiking poles, and started down a trail to the bottom in late May alternating sunshine and grainy snow. Its rim sits at between 8,0000' and 9,000' feet elevation, so the uphill hike was a bit more strenuous for us sea-level dwellers. Hoodoos glowed with afternoon light as if made of alabaster, even more so by dawn's early light. The trails are very well maintained and signed, and other hikers were friendly and helpful. We enjoyed the Lodge's evening ranger talk on the cosmos. Bryce is one of the best dark skies parks in our country, and that night we were blessed to see a sky full of easily identifiable constellations and Venus as big as a landing 747. Out on the road, buses bring visitors in from distant parking lots, reducing the number of self-driving tours and relieving road congestion on the road to the furthest-south viewpoint, though we would have been content to just hike down into the major amphitheater we first saw. Grand old trees and pinecones framed this gorgeous vista, no matter which way we looked. Now, if only we'd seen Bryce at the end of the hiking trip (after Grand Canyon and Zion, in that order), we'd have not been spoiled for the rest of them!","May 28, 2015",Words fail.,45,"Lacey, WA",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"My husband and I visited Bryce Canyon - April 2015. We decided to hike the ""Fairyland Loop Trail"" as suggested by another visitor. WOW! The hike was just under 5 hours long - with plenty of rest/picture stops and snack/lunch breaks. We have hiked 17 miles in the Grand Canyon, Zion Ntl Park, Arches, the Midwest, Colorado, Florida and more - and Bryce is by far my favorite hike we've ever done. It looks like and feels like you are on another planet. This hike has never ending sights and changes. It's actually a pretty moderate hike/walk - the only thing that got to us was the elevation as we've lived at 5ft above sea level Fl for 3 years. I suggest a hiking pole, a backpack with salty snacks, food & plenty of WATER. Also - there is little areas of shade here so SUNBLOCK or maybe an umbrella to hide from the sun some would be beneficial. Also the high elevation makes you more prone to sunburn. If altitude bothers you I recommend some medicine for that or at least ibuprofen because it is at 8,000 ft which can make you feel quite winded. I HIGHLY recommend taking regular ten minute breaks to catch your breath. Don't push it or rush. Keep a calm steady pace and you'll be good. We saw many older couples on the trail. We are 27 and 33 and did not prepare for this hike and didn't find it necessary to. It's a bit long for kids I think but older, athletic children and teens can do it. There's a few uphill climbs that will make you tired. Afraid of heights? There's mostly sloped hills beside you but no huge scary drop offs unless you walk to some specific ledges that are not necessary to completing the trail. Fear of heights was not an issue for me. The photos you can take here are never ending so you want to have a camera with lots of space. The scenery here is unbelievably unique and truthfully I can't believe a place like this even exists in America. Why it is not as well known I don't know. If you can't do an entire hike - do the rim trail and get an overall view of the place. Grab a map, and DO THE FAIRYLAND LOOP TRAIL. You will be SO glad that you visited this park.","May 27, 2015",Exceeded our Expectations!!!,118,"Sarasota, Florida",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"All people should make the trip to this and the other National Parks in Utah. Who knew you could experience such beauty in our country for $25 a car! Every family should make this trip. My favorite was Inspiration Pointe. You need to use the shuttle system and book a tour (about 3-1/2 hours). My only feedback to the park staff- you are all very friendly and courteous, but need more training on offering directions. Treat everyone like it is the first time they have been there and don't know where anything is or how it works. Most of the staff were weak on directions except for the shuttle and tour bus drivers.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This was one of the most amazing places that I have seen. We hiked around the rim to several spots, up to Bryce Point. The weather was cool enough in May & it even turned cold & snowed on us for a bit. Every time you looked there was a different view. I can't even begin to explain the colors & how it changed with every step. The view of the ever changing canyon & grottos from Bryce point are spectacular. If you are up for it, I recommend the hike on Navajo Loop to get the views from below. We hiked just under 10 miles and brought water & a backpack lunch. We have marked this trip off of our bucket list but have already talked about returning to camp here sometime. We drove to Inspiration Point & hiked from there, using the tram to bring us down to Sunset View which was where we took the lower trail & looped back up to hike back to our vehicle. The use of the park tram is a great way to see more of the trails without overdoing it.","May 27, 2015",Breathtaking & Incredibly beautiful!,9,,5

You can sit there for hours wondering what the columns look like, sometimes a human figure sometimes and animal. We went there on a drippy wet day and went on hikes at two trails. The views are spectacular and the rain and fog added to the beauty of it all.

It was doable with children, ages 6 and 7. It is nice to go when it is not super hot, because there is limited shade. Bring plenty of water, sun screen and comfortable shoes. There are loose rocks on the trail so it could be a little slippery. There are plenty of other beautiful hikes. We took wonderful pictures from the sunrise point.

There is also a shuttle that goes to some of the park. We took the shuttle and hiked some easy trails one day. (Sunset to Sunrise is paved.) We returned the next day to drive to some of the outer areas that the shuttle doesn't reach.

The rim trail from the main area of the park is very accessible. There were several people in wheelchairs enjoying this trail. If you are able, I would highly recommend a hike down into the hoodoos. We went down the Navajo trail and come up Queen's Garden. Stopping frequently to enjoy the views, take yet another photo, we spent about 90 minutes down among the hoodoos.At the rim, it is over 8,000' elevation.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This was a last minute addition on our itinerary, as in the morning of, after speaking with some folks at breakfast at the Grand Canyon - North Rim. We were cynical on what it had to offer because we thought to ourselves ""how exciting can more rocks be?"" We were scheduled to drive directly to Zion but were glad we made the ~2 hour roundtrip detour. This is a much smaller/manageable park relative to Arches or Canyonlands. We did about a 2 hour hike on the Navajo Loop trail and were amazed by the sites. This trail leads you from the rim down into the narrow canyon walls which open to a more open bottom that has a surprising level of vegetation and animal life (including deers) and then back up to the rim. Along the way, you get unbelievable vistas of the surrounding landscape and spectacular perspective on the eerily shaped canyon walls. Please note, these canyons are very different then what you see at the other parks in Utah.We spent about 4 hours in the park and we felt it provided a good sense of what the park was all about.

Bring good hiking shoes, plenty of water, sunscreen, hat, and a light jacket as the temperature can vary depending on where you are in the canyon. There are no restrooms once you venture onto the trails so plan accordingly. If you or your kids want to do the ""Hike the HooDoo"" challenge bring a camera to take pictures of yourself with the gold metal trailmarkers throughout the park. Once you have gotten 3 you can turn it in at the ranger station for a special pin (my husband was pleasantly surprised it was not a plastic badge).

If you are wanting to walk into the canyon its one of the first points on the left, park up and walk down into the canyon. The walk is amazing but very steep in areas uneven ground and narrow passages in places,therefore you need good worn in walking boots, water and snack food. This is an early start if you wish to do the walk. If you want to just drive to the many points then you can do this, park up and spend time viewing.

It could have been snowing as far as I'm concerned. When nature is beautiful, there is no wrong time to visit. There's an ethereal presence when you're hiking inside the canyon that makes it virtually impossible not to appreciate this wondrous environment. The hoodoos, the textures, the smell, the sounds and the natural history of time can be seen and felt as you experience the canyon. My niece was awestruck by how it made her feel. It didn't stop tourists from China, Sweden, Turkey, nor Americans from hiking through the rainy atmosphere. You can go at your own pace. If you can't hike inside (due to physical complications), you can drive the perimeter of the park and still take in the breathtaking vistas.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Our family took a camping trip out west several years ago and on our way to the Grand Canyon, unexpectedly woke up just outside Zion National Park. So of course, we took a day to visit and I was blown away by its beauty. My husband was disappointed that as close as we were, we didn't have time to visit Bryce Canyon as well. When we were planning our visit this time, and my husband put Bryce on the ""to-do"" list, I honestly didn't think I'd enjoy it after having seen Zion. But, wow - was I ever surprised! In its own unique way, it's completely magnificent! When we arrived late in the day, we went to the visitor center, where a park ranger recommended we drive out to Rainbow Point to get a good idea of what the park was about. We did and took a short 1 mile hike on the still snowy Bristlecone Loop Trail, then backtracked by car and stopped at several viewpoints on the way out to watch the sunset. Each stop was equally spectacular, and afforded us an idea of what hiking trails we wanted to see the next day.Based on the ranger's recommendation, the following morning, we started out at Sunrise Point on the Queen's Garden trail. It was a nice, easy walk and quickly took us down into the heart of the Canyon. From there, we took the moderate Navajo Loop Trail, and then out to Peekaboo Trail, looping back onto Navajo, until finally we made it back to Sunset Point. All in all, it ended up being about an 8 mile hike that took us to some of the highest peaks and also down into the floor of the canyon, where each was an amazing collection of color, vegetation and different rock formations. The last section of Navajo Loop was a steep and strenuous switchback that was intense. We wished we had done the hike in reverse, so once we got to the top, we asked another ranger why they recommended starting at Sunrise instead of Sunset Point. Apparently, more injuries are caused by mis-steps down the steep switchbacks rather than heading upward. Although I'm in good shape, If I had to do it again, I would probably go in reverse anyway. There were plenty of hikers struggling and stopping every 10-20 feet on the way back up because it was so strenuous!No matter which hike you choose, the view will be completely different as you progress, making Bryce overwhelmingly beautiful at every vantage point. Go! You won't be disappointed!","May 13, 2015",I wasn't expecting it to be as spectacular as it is!,73,"Tellico Plains, Tennessee",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"WOW, WOW WOW, Its a wonderful place to be. First you will see Red Canyon on the way to Bryce canyon but once to reach to Bryce Canyon , I would suggest Sunrise and Sunset to see the magic of mother nature in Bryce Canyon itself.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"While the views from the lookouts are incredibly striking, Bryce's hoodoos really come to life when you hike inside the canyon. We did the Tower Bridge Trail and the Navajo Loop, and looking up through the rich white and orange rock formations at the deep blue sky is a very different experience from just standing at the top and looking across the amphitheater.

We were here at the end of April, and my 70-year of father and I did a 1.3 mile hike between two points, and that was incredible. The views of the canyon and the rock formations were mind-blowing. There was still snow on the ground under some trees in patches (not much), and it was great weather for hiking. This was truly a remarkable and memorable national park.","May 9, 2015","Incredible vistas, great hike",24,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"You have to see it to believe it, it looks unreal in real life, and pictures do not do it justice. You can travel around the rim of the canyon and get a good view of the canyon’s features or you can hike some of the trails and get a close-up view of the many hoodoos forming a forest of stone. Some of the hikes are fairly easy, just be sure to bring enough water, wear good hiking shoes and wear sunscreen and of course, don’t forget your camera. For reference, I’m in my late 60’s and my wife is mid 60’s and we hiked the Navajo Loop and Queen's Garden Trail without a problem. There are also on and off shuttle busses that will take you alone the canyon rim.

Grand Canyon was created forcefully, Bryce is a delicate piece of artwork by mother nature. They are so near each other, but are vastly different. Look forward as you walk, but keep turning around to appreciate it from another angle. I still cannot get her brilliance out of my head.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited Bryce after a really enjoyable few days in Zion. We did not know what to expect but were stunned by the extraordinary sights that greeted us which made it a very different, but equally enjoyable experience.We arrived on a relatively clear evening to see the sunset over the amphitheatre located near the lodge, enjoying stunning views of the canyon from both Sunset and Sunrise Points. The following day we followed the guide advice and drove to Rainbow Point to take in the different, but equally spectacular views. We then stopped at the various 'lookout points' along the return journey to take in the varying vistas, including our first arch. We did not venture down into the canyon on any of the trails, but enjoyed the walk along the canyon rim from Sunrise to Bryce Points.We stayed in one of the Lodge cabins during our stay. This exceeded our expectations, was very comfortable and warm with good facilities. We did not miss the television but did find the lack of room wifi access a nuisance, joining the throngs in the Lodge lobby desperately trying to hookup their iPads et al to their networks.The only downside for us during this very enjoyable visit was the Lodge dining room. The service from the kitchen was slow and the food not very good. The experience was not helped by what to us appeared to be a shortage of servers, so that those who there were overworked and stressed.In summary if visiting Utah do not miss Bryce Canyon and if you want to stay choose a cabin.","May 6, 2015",Extraordinary,114,"Englefield Green, United Kingdom",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"The first full day was cold and windy, and were were weary from previous days' hiking, so we were happy to do all the driving-based view points. Really, all of them are worth stopping. We drove all the way out to Rainbow to start off, so that all of our stops were on the right on the way back down.Bristlecone loop at Rainbow was worth it, especially in the fresh snow. It is relatively flat, smooth and wide 1-mile loop with spectacular views and fewer people. Rainbow is at 9100 ft, while the park entrance is down at 8000, so the views and terrain really do change.The second day we did Fairyland loop. WOW! I can't personally attest that loop is better than any other Bryce offers, but were were very pleased with the variety that loop offers. In any event, you must really take a trail some distance below the rim. Just like at the Grand Canyon, your experience becomes much more immediate and interesting once your get amongst the rock formations, rather than just milling about above them.","May 5, 2015",worth two days,334,"Houston, Texas",5

It goes down into the hoodoos. You'll be in awe of the colors! When I went snow was on the ground but it was not slippery. You'll continue around through a section of green trees. It felt like I had missed a turn or something because I wasn't expecting it to be so lush. You will turn right onto the Navajo Trail. It starts to head up hill at this point. Finally you will reach the switchbacks called Wall Street. I loved this section! You can start here if you want but I was told to start at the Queens Garden entrance because the view is better.

You can easily see the canyon from above by walking along the rim but a hike into the canyon gives you a whole different perspective. We walked down to Queen's garden at Sunrise Point, then walked around Peek-a-Boo loop and then up to Sunset point. This is the route suggested by an employee at the visitor center. This is a beautiful route but it is also a very challenging walk due to length, severe elevation changes, and high altitude. Would recommend starting at Sunset Point and ending at Sunrise Point. The number of steep switchbacks coming up to Sunset Point are brutal.","April 27, 2015",Spectacular views.,11,"Rochester, Minnesota",5

The shuttle had just started a few days before, but we have a handicapped plate and wanted to park close to look outs. I imagine in high season parking could be a huge issue.We had so much fun seeing snow up at the top. Good stop is at Visitor's Center, see the movie to get an over view. Then I'd drive to the top - end of the road -- without stopping. Then I would stop at all outlooks on the way down. My reason is that to me the best part was the ""auditorium"" which we saw as our first stop. The rest of the Canyon is wonderful, but the first stop was the thriller.Roads are good, map is good. We took so many photos. The sights almost brought me to tears as they are so beautiful. So happy I was able to visit and encourage everyone to visit. If you can go late April it is nice, less people.

It was the way to go. The entire park was just so pretty. We were there for over 5 hours and enjoyed ourselves immensely. I would suggest you book a hotel far in advance as lots of things fill up quickly. I'm glad we went before school's out as I'm sure it cut back on some of the tourists. You also might want to take some food along in the car with you if you plan on being there around lunch or dinner. Be aware that if you're a senior you can use the National Park Pass for free entry.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Our family was in awe of Bryce Canyon, and we highly recommend this park! We traveled there during the week after Easter, and found it to be very enjoyable- much more so than Zion, which was crowded beyond belief and not at all relaxing (very scenic, but way too many cars and people to allow a peaceful experience!)Bryce may have been more crowded during the afternoon hours, but we visited there mostly in the mornings, including three sunrises- made easy by our stay at the 5 minute away Best Western Grand Hotel (see review). The sunrises here are magnificent no matter where you are in the park, but of course Sunrise Point allows for some wonderful photo opportunities and it was the most popular spot to be.We found that April was a great time to visit- they still allow you to drive into the park, so you can go wherever you want whenever you want, without having to take a mandatory shuttle. And, while the temperatures were chilly in the early morning, it warmed up throughout the day, and for most of our week there it was sunny with beautiful clouds. One morning it snowed, but it cleared up after a few hours.We recommend that for your first time into the park, start at the far end and work your way down, one outlook at a time- you will find that most visitors do the opposite, so the viewing platforms will be less crowded. We also recommend taking at least one hike down one of the many trails- we took a hike down the Navajo Loop Trail, staring at Sunset Point, and it was an incredible experience! However, it was very strenuous trying to work our way back up, especially since we were not used to the high altitude. Also, for most of the trails there are no guardrails, and it can be narrow and steep- parents be aware!A few more notes- the park was free to enter before 8:00am, but on the day of our first visit we purchased a year long National Parks pass for 80.00 to allow anytime visits to both Bryce and Zion. Also, on your way in or out, be sure to visit Fairyland Point- it's a ""blink and you'll miss it"" entry point before you go into the main entrance to the park, and it is only marked by a small sign that you can see on your way out. We thought it was stunning, both during the day and at sunrise.Final note- there are some beautiful birds at this park! Beautiful birds, and adorable prairie dogs : )","April 16, 2015",Visiting Bryce Canyon,34,Michigan,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We went here for a day trip from Vegas, not for the faint hearted as its 520 mile round trip, but for me the trip is part of the experience as you travel through Nevada, Arizona and Utah going 8000ft up into the mountains. There are alot of through to see along the way. Pnce at Bryce Canyon, the usual $25 fee applies per car and you get to enter the park. So we wanted to get the best in an hour so I asked the ranger at the gate what should be do, she recommended the first 4 viewing points, which you drive to one by one. Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration and Bryce Point. So as it was the middle of the day we jumped right to the second two, and well, wow. I have seen many Canyons and they are all beautiful and stunning in their own way, but Bryce next to the Grand Canyon, which is awe inspiring because of the scale, is not big, but it is one of the most beautiful landscapes.If you have the chance to go you could easily spend a few days hiking, but if like me you have only a few hours, go to those first 4 viewing points and soak it up.Highly recommended..","April 11, 2015",Amazing and fragile.,58,"Canberra, Australia",5

Bryce Canyon itself is stunning and had reasonably easy trail walks, filled with magnificent scenery. We didn't expect it to be as cold as it is this time of year, there is still snow on the sides of the canyon, which looked fantastic but did add an extra chill in the air, which means rug up and get ready for 36F (4Celsius) temperature according to the car at 9am. It was colder at night - some water left in our car had frozen. It did warm up during the day and we were comfortable in jeans and jackets and the day very pleasant.If you take a walk through the canyon, you will warm up, but it can still be cold, but it is well worth the effort. There were people of all ages and sizes walking the trails, it is not only for the fit and heathy, but sensible shoes a must - don't forget a bottle of water.There are horse trail rides, had we been staying longer, we would definitely have taken a trail ride. We saw where people were riding out through the canyon and it looked amazing - there is a separate horse trail.Bryce Canyon is definitely worth the visit and it give time to reflect on the insightful, bold and ambitious adventurers that settled the area.We stayed at the Best Western Plus, which was perfectly fine and we ate at Ruby's across the road, but are just outside the park only 10 minutes drive from the Best Western Plus and US$25 entry fee.","April 7, 2015","Incredible, stunning and take a jumper this time of year!",67,"Sydney, Australia",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is one of those ""bucket list"" places that should be experienced and will never be forgotten. Your level of involvement can range from the drive-though tour with stops at overlooks to full-blown hikes at the bottom of the canyon, as your interest and physical condition dictate. Most people do the 18-mile round-trip driving tour along the rim of the canyon, which can be done comfortably in about 2.5 hours, with stops at every overlook. Best to drive to the end of the road first, then stop at the overlooks on the way back, as they'll then all be on your right, and no need to cross traffic You'll see arches, hoo-doos and other beautiful formations. Seasonal traffic may impact driving time -- 2.5 hours was our time in late March. Summer traffic is likely to lead to slower progress.If you're visiting Zion, Bryce is about two hours away -- easy enough for a day-trip. Driving between the two, you'll pass through Red Rock Canyon (see my separate review), which is also beautiful to see. Spending one day at Zion and 1/2 day at Bryce makes for great memories......If you have the opportunity, don't miss seeing the natural wonder of Bryce -- and Zion, as well.....Enjoy!","April 2, 2015",Like No Other Place......,510,"Plymouth, Michigan",5

So we got back to the car and stared towards Bryce. The drive there was amazing, especially Red Canyon. But Bryce was nothing short of the most amazing thing I've ever seen. Wow.

The trails are marked very well but humorous to hear people that cannot remember which way they are headed and which way they are coming from. They eventually get turned around and go back the way they came thinking they are going on to the next sight. The Hoodoos wear away with time due to the wind, rain and the freeze/thaw of the soil. Some people were looking for a famous Hoodoo called the Poodle that now has only a few pieces left the guide could point out to them.The guided tours are well worth the time and the guides have some great stories.

I think I was more amazed by the sight of Bryce Canyon than the sight of the Grand Canyon, eventhough both are beautiful! Also, we've seen a lot of animals in Bryce Canyon! Watch out, because they come close to the road.My tip if you take your own car into the parc: drive to the far end and start your sightseeing from there, because than the lookouts are on the right side of the road and it's easier to stop.","March 24, 2015",Must see,14,"Zaandam, The Netherlands",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"What incredible views so unlike any other park. We visited with our dogs, so we were only able to experience the drive (stopping at most all overlooks) and walking the paved Sunset to Sunrise trail, which was the most popular spot among all the park's overlooks--but even that was nothing compared to any trail in Zion, which we had visited a couple days prior without our dogs. It certainly seemed as if you can get off on numerous trails (including a horseback riding trail) and truly experience this gorgeous park in complete solitude. Even on our ""popular"" trail during Spring Break, we were able to sit on a bench overlooking Thor's Hammer and the Queen's Garden and absorb the vista in silence. There was a surprising amount of bird activity. If you are visiting both Zion and Bryce, realize that Bryce is much higher elevation. It was in the 40s and 50s when we visited, with snow covering much of the landscape in the park as well as the mountains off in the distance. I read on the NPS site that you can join a ranger-guided Full Moon tour any month; looking at the hoodoos, I can only imagine how surreal it would be to see them in moonlight. They were amazing in sunlight. For those looking to choose between Bryce and Zion, good luck. I would try to find a way to see both. They are so unique: Zion with its gorgeous swirling rock formations, river, wildlife, and canyon; and Bryce with its majestic hoodoos and long views across valleys and mountains. I found Bryce much more peaceful, less crowded. But the views in both are stunning. If you are looking for a tranquil, ""connect with nature"" hiking experience during Spring Break time, choose Bryce (and bring warm layers).","March 21, 2015","Unique Park, Amazing Hoodoos, Long Views.",26,"Houston, Texas",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"So far in my life this is quite simply the most stunning place I have visited, and I never seem to have enough time when I'm there.Mother Nature proves just how amazing something so destructive as erosion can create such spectacular scenery. The hoodoos rise majestically to the edge of the canyon (although it's not technically a canyon and is more a basin). Taking a stroll down and into the canyon is an experience to savour and if you have time and are fit enough to do so then take plenty of water and stroll (or hike) through making sure you stop at every twist and turn for another photo opportunity. You could spend all day (well I could) just sitting in one spot and every minute the landscape will alter slightly be it due to cloud, the sun moving and shadows constantly changing shape. The orange and pinks are vibrant at the best of times but at sunrise and sunset they take on a whole new array of colours, and if you're lucky enough to get snow when you visit the stark white against the back drop of the orange, with the smattering of dark green pine trees will provide you with many a stunning photograph.","March 18, 2015",Simply Stunning,34,,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Our family visited Bryce Park over spring break. I knew to expect snow but was unprepared for how much snow. The trails were covered with ice/snow and hiking boots with gripons were recommended. We only had tennis shoes but the gripons would have made our trek much easier. We did the Queens/Navajo Combo hike and slipped and slid the whole way. It was a GREAT hike that I would really recommend. My 9 & 7 year old really enjoyed it as well although climbing out of Bryce Canyon did cause some minor complaining. We were all really tired as the path was snow covered, slushy, and muddy in spots. We drove the scenic route after that and stopped at the overlooks to get a view of the southern part of the park. My kids also enjoyed the Junior Ranger program. They've done several of these programs before but the Ranger at Bryce took extra time to go over their booklet and to talk to the about their park experience. It was really nice considering the Visitor Center was really busy at the time.","March 12, 2015",Unique park: Loved the hoodoos!,24,,5

Major problem though is that there are no services in park before April or May, which is mad when so many people prefer out of season and less crowds. Restrooms are commodes without running water....heaven knows what they smell like in summer, remember to bring hand gel. But the hoodoos give great photos and are worth the trip.","March 10, 2015",Worth the long drive.,214,"Norfolk, United Kingdom",4
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Driving from Moab, UT to Bryce Canyon is a pretty long drive. We also took the scenic route, which added about an hour to the trip. We enjoyed our drive in the park, stopping at several lookouts. Great views. On leaving the park, it is mostly downhill, with a speed limit at 20 - 30 MPH. Most areas this is a very reasonable speed limit, as to drive any faster would be irresponsible and dangerous. But there are many places, especially near the exit, where the road is straight but still going downhill. Even with your foot off the accelerator you pick up speed very easily. Before you know it you can be traveling at 40 - 50 MPH. Then you see the ranger, parked over to the side. In a blink of an eye you see the ""bubble gum lights"" come on, and you know you are toast! Sure enough the Ranger gets right behind me, and I pull over. Just be aware, speeding in a National Park is a Federal Offense. So just be aware in a National Part, especially Bryce Canyon, don't speed. Even though you may have some a@@hole tailgating you, just ignore them and drive the speed limit or lower. Enjoy your trips through the National Parks.","March 7, 2015","Great scenery, but watch your speed!!!",35,"Cape Cod, Ma",3
Bryce Canyon National Park,"I was amazed by Bryce Canyon. I arrived as the sun was setting and the full moon was rising, and was able to get a decent picture of the moon over the Hoodoos. The next day, I drove through the entire park at sunrise and I hiked the Queens Garden Trail to the Navajo Loop Trail. The trails were very nice and pretty easy, except coming up to the rim again (the elevation really messed with me). It's pretty easy to see most of the park in one day, unless you want to hike all the trails.","March 7, 2015",Beautiful,51,"Duluth, Minnesota, United States",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"This was our third trip to Bryce Canyon. The first two were fantastic. This trip was not as much so because of all the snow. Trails were impassable, camping not feasible and extremely cold weather. I would recommend not going to Bryce Canyon the first week of March! Wait until the weather warns up.","March 6, 2015",Disappointing,58,"Boise, Idaho",3
Bryce Canyon National Park,"The park service does a terrible job of making this park accessible to the public during the winter snow period. They only open 9 miles of road into the park, do not clear any of the camp grounds and do absolutely ZERO to make the trails and walks accessible to people with snow shoes or cross country ski gear. Despite their lack of service they have no problem what ever in charging the full $25 admission price for you to drive up to the scenic outlooks and back.The poor attitude of the parks service folks seemed pervasive. The lady at the gate was no help at all, told us to go to the visitor centre with any questions. We did but, the over sized fellow manning the visitors booth could hardly be bothered to talk to the few visitors that were in there.Despite my criticism of the Parks Service this is still a spectacularly beautiful place to see. If you come with the right equipment, summer or winter the hiking is a little on the challenging side due to weather and topography but it is well worth it to see the spectacular sights that are here.","March 6, 2015",Great views and Vistas but VERY poor service from the Parks People,154,"Edmonton, Canada",4

Bryce Canyon National Park,"For full disclosure, we went on a snowy day when park ranger waived the vehicle fee...but that also meant full access and visibility weren't guaranteed. And that was true. Visiting in winter is tricky because of the snow but park officials do their best to clear roads and keep areas safe. On our day, we only had access to Sunset Point, and that offered amazing views albeit with limited visibility. Still, we were able to make it down the point's somewhat steep trail to the bottom for some gorgeous views and photo ops. Everyone sees Bryce during summer and fall months, but winter also offers a grand and unique view of a magnificent place.","March 1, 2015",Such beauty even with snow,31,New York,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Went to Bryce hoping for snow and the opportunity to get some pictures of the hoodoos capped in snow. We got 9 inches in roughly 30 hours, so we were not disappointed.

We brought snow shoes and micro spikes so we were able to see all of the major scenic points and get some outstanding hikes in the area.We also went snow shoeing in Red Canyon.","March 1, 2015","Gorgeous place for sightseeing, hiking, and other outdoor adventures",49,"San Diego, California",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Visiting Bryce Canyon is fantastic and well worth it. However it is not that big and one day suffices to see enough of it. And the bewilderment of seeing the famous sights is sadly attenuated by the obnoxious tourist trap town adjacent to it. I stayed there in February on busy valentine's day week-end and furthermore during the town's snow/winter festival. Incredibly enough despite the easily anticipated rush of visitors, only one restaurant was open in the whole town. Needless to say it was beyond overwhelmed. Fortunately the only grocery store in town, which also belongs to the same people who seem to own the whole town, was open and we were able to get dinner from the frozen food section, thanks to the room having a microwave. I have rarely felts so taken for granted while travelling.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We only had a day to spend in the canyon, so really needed to make the most of our time there.The rangers at the information centre were really helpful, they spent time with us planning how to best use our time and suggested which hike would give us the best overall sensation of the canyon. We combined two hikes into a loop, downhill to the Queens Gardens and then back up hill via the Navajo trail. A great hike, not overly difficult but beautiful.We combined that with a picnic lunch and then drove round the 18 miles of road and stopped at each point to admire the view and take lots of pictures. There was some snow around but due to the abnormally warm winter the trails were dry.We were there on Presidents weekend so had free entry to the park. There were lots of other visitors but it didn't feel at all crowded.","February 18, 2015",WOW says it all,42,"Auckland, New Zealand",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We had just come from Zion National Park and didn't think that could be beat, but Bryce Canyon National Park is also a gem. It is so unique and different than Zion National Park. The hoodoos and rock formations are beyond beautiful and awe inspiring. So glad we made the trip from Vegas. Is really an easy trip from Vegas, stopping at Zion National Park first for a couple days, then spent the night in St. George, then on our way to Bryce Canyon. St. George is a great city with several nice motels and eating establishments. They were 70 degrees already the day we were there and said their spring is not far away and temps will stay in this range now for awhile.

As someone once explained to me, Zion is the ""appetizer"", Grand Canyon is the ""entree"" and Bryce is the ""dessert"". The beauty of Bryce cannot be shown in a photograph. You have to visit there. The vistas and the walks are like nothing you have experienced. You can be as active as you like on your visit. You can simply look and see from the bus stop or you can take as adventurous a hike as you want down into the canyons. This is a must see for anyone who is interested in visiting the National Parks. It is not really close to anything else, so it is a trip to get there but so worth the travel.","February 18, 2015",Unbelievable Beauty,15,"Sunset Beach, North Carolina",5

The sandstone hoodoos are amazing with rich colors of red, orange and creamy whites. Walking down and into the canyon is truly a treat. A good 2 hour hike is going into the canyon at the ""Sunset"" trail and coming back up at ""Sunrise"". The ""Sunset"" trail is much harder to go up. The section of the trail at ""Sunset"" called Wall Street is truly amazing with tall sandstone walls and a pine tree that towers up to the sky between the stone walls.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"FAIRYLAND POINT IN BRYCE CANYON NP, UTAH  (UTAH’S HIDDEN BYWAYS XV) Have you ever visited FAIRYLAND? No, not the artificial, man-made, tourist stops in California and Florida, but a real FAIRYLAND created by nature, easily gotten to, but not on the radar of most visitors. This Fairyland is located in Bryce Canyon National Park and is easy to access.  FAIRYLAND is an extraordinary area of the Pink Member of the Claron Formation Sandstone, eroded by wind, ice, and water over geologic times. These fanciful Buttes, Arches, and Mesas with unique names, as well as a multitude of hoodoos of exceptional shapes and colors, give the traveler a short trip through some of the pre-historic geology of the region. The colors and shadows emanating from these eroding structures and monoliths produce visual images that make this area highly photogenic. Furthermore, the area is not difficult to hike in, as long as sensible shoes, water, and a first aid kit are your possession. It is also advisable to bring a hat, a light jacket, chap-stick, and some food with you due to the length of some of the trails.  From an amateur photographer’s point of view, the Fairyland area was visual heaven. A photographic tip; try to avoid shooting into the sun if can avoid it. In addition, avoid getting too much sky in your images. Keep the land/sky ratio to 3/1 or 4/1, unless the cloud formations warrant changes. There was always something to see around each bend, and the movement of the hiker relative to the rock formations ensures an ever changing juxtaposition of red rock formations and blue sky. This allows for unbelievable photographic opportunities, with the play of the red rock and shadows against the blue of the sky and clouds. Ah, you may ask, where is this place and how do I get there. If you have visited Bryce Canyon National Park, you have passed the signed entrance to the access road without realizing that it is there. The access road lies BEFORE you get to the entrance station (fee area) of the park, making it, in theory, a free ride. If you are staying in the Ruby’s Inn area outside the park, make a RIGHT and proceed toward the park. At about a half mile before the entrance station, there is a signed road going toward your LEFT. Make a left here and proceed for about 2-3 miles on a twisted road to the small parking area. Park, and LOCK, your vehicle here and proceed on foot to the Fairyland viewpoint (7758’). One can see by the enclosed images that this area is fantastic, and relatively devoid of crowds.  I have found that the photographic lighting is best in the early to mid- afternoon. There is more direct lighting on the rock formations during this period. Soak in the hidden beauty of this area (see images). If you have the proper shoes, water, and equipment previously discussed, you may start working toward your left (viewing the canyon). You will be entering the terminus of the Fairyland Loop trail. It gets a bit sandy and close here, and there are no guard rails, so be careful with your footing. If you proceed further, you will drop down into Fairyland Canyon and Campbell Canyon. The view is always changing, so enjoy the walk down, but remember that you have to come back up.  If you walk to your right from Fairyland point, you will join the RIM TRAIL, which will eventually get you back to Sunrise Point. Having taken this glorious walk, I would recommend it for walkers in good shape. The scenery and photography is unbelievable and definitely worth the time. A two vehicle concept works here, with a vehicle at both ends of the trailhead. After yore visit to Fairyland Point, you can drive back to the main road and make a right, giving you the rest of the day to explore this magnificent landscape and spend more time in Bryce Canyon National Park.","February 12, 2015",FAIRYLAND POINT IN BRYCE CANYON NP (UTAH'S HIDDEN BYWAYS XV),298,"Bloomfield, New Jersey",5

You can drive to all vista points in a day but to take advantage of the hikes you will need more time.The highest elevation is 9115 but it was a beautiful sunny day when we visited and you could see for miles. I also visited Yosemite in January and there is something about snow covered mountains that make it magical.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is not the biggest national park or the most famous, but it must be one of the most spectacular. The unusual 'hoodoos', the signature rock spires, combined with ever-changing weather and sunlight make this a photographers dream. Bring lots and lots of memory cards. One could have a lovely experience just driving or riding the trolley to the various 'amphitheatre' overlooks in the park. The views are stunning and easily accessible without almost any walking from the parking lot. But to really blow your mind and have the full 'Bryce Experience' you have to hike down amongst the hoodoos. Because Bryce is all about erosion, the hikes all start up on the rim and take you down into the valleys. Just remember that eventually you will need to come back up!! We were in Bryce for just two days. It was November, so it was not crowded, but the weather was all over the place. We started with a dusting of snow, got clouded over, had warm, full sunshine that quickly became a full-blown whiteout snowstorm that quickly cleared to cold, clear skies. And that was just the first day!! A photographers dream! Nothing like Bryce in a blanket of snow.We did two hikes. The first started at Bryce Point. It's called the Peek-A-Boo Trail or Loop. It's about 3 miles in length, but don't forget the going down and the coming back up. And plenty of water. There is nothing in the way of water or food along the way. The guide said this should take 2-3 hours. We took 5 because I took a lot of photos and it was so beautiful. . . hard not to linger and savor the beauty. And it felt like we had the park to ourselves. I believe we saw 12 people in 5 hours.The second day we got up very early and went to Sunrise Point. . . for the sunrise!! Alright, we were about 10 minutes late for the actual sunrise, but oh my, how beautiful those golden and red rocks are in that magical morning light! More memory cards, please!! We hiked a short way down the Queen's Garden path, but since we had gotten up so early, our plan was to go back to our hotel. . . The Best Western PLUS Bryce Canyon Grand Hotel. . . and have breakfast, a nice self-serve buffet that was included in the price of the room. Nice hotel! One of the perks of small park: Bryce Canyon Village is just outside the park entrance, and it was maybe 2 or 3 miles from our hotel to Sunrise Point.After breakfast we went back to Sunset Point and hiked down Wall Street (very steep. . . I recommend descending here and coming up near Thor's Hammer on the Navajo Trail) which leads to a very narrow, glowing red passage thru the rocks and opens out into the valley and the Navajo Trail. We continued around the loop and came up at Thor's Hammer and all the wonderful vistas looking back north towards Sunrise Point.One other 'don't miss' is Natural Bridge. The one road in Bryce is only 18 miles long from the entrance to Rainbow Point. Along the way there are several overlooks. Toward the end is Natural Bridge. Park your car and walk about 10 steps to the fence. . . do what everyone else does: look out. . . where is it?? Then look down. It's right at your feet. Very deceptive and cool.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is one of nature’s miracles, not to be missed while in the southern Utah. A pleasant one hour and a half ride north-west from Kanab takes one into a paradise of cathedrals, bridges and towers displayed on a palette of yellow and brown, spread over huge valleys, and surrounded by a marvel of steep walls.The asphalted road winds up from one view-point to another, allowing visitors to admire the incredible architecture in sandstone. According to a native legend, the grouped and scattered stone shapes used to be animal creatures that lived there well before the times of any humans. For some reason, these creatures were bad, therefore, the Great Spirit cursed them and here they are nowadays, frozen in time and space, in front of our eyes.If you are in good shape, come prepared for an amazing walk on the trails all around the canyon. Don't forget to pick up a map at the entrance to read about available trails, their duration and level of difficulty. Yes, you can drive your own car on the canyon road, however, there is an alternative of taking the hop-on, hop-off shuttle instead. Yes, there is a fee for entering the park, which covers the services you choose: either self-drive or parking your car. Washrooms are available at some of the vista points, however, food and water can be purchased only at main stops.It is advisable to carry drinking water with you and wear comfortable, hiking clothing and shoes, suitable to the season you are visiting as summers can be pretty hot while into fall and spring, it can be quite chilly in the canyon.","January 23, 2015",Sandstone Metropolis,200,"Mississauga, Canada",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Of course the nature, views and park is great, especially right after a snow storm dusting.The park in early January was dominated by foreign tourist. Many who traveled half way around the world to the US to see our natural wonders.What was disappointment - in fact embarrassing as a US citizen - is the fact that the US Parks service didn't care enough to have the roads fully plowed after 6 - 12' of snow and almost 2 days of clear weather. This left only 1/5 of the park and roads open...Somehow the local county AND the private concessionaires at Bryce City ALL had all the roads and parking lots nicely cleared. I saw the park service equipment, they could have had the parks road cleared too with their own equipment. And could have easily worked with the county and the local businesses to get them to help if needed....The only thing that makes sense to me is that this US National Park's leadership sucks and some staff does not care enough about customer service to have plowed the roads. Wake up. Your laziness deprived me and more importantly global tourist to not see one of our national treasures...","January 10, 2015","Gret Vista's, Poor Representation of US and Park's Customer Service",118,"Sebastopol, California",3

There are two things I recollect about Bryce Canyon - it was the best experience, best views, best colours of all of them. Fantastic view in light of sunset. If you are going to see Yosemite, National Monument, Arches, Zion - do not miss Bryce. It might be your best memory, as it was in my case.My tip - it seems that actual view completes the picture, there isn't necessarily a need to take a walk down, it doesn't add that much to overall experience. I would rather make it short but intense.Lovely place for couples admiring the place in the evening Sun.","January 6, 2015",This is no.1 west coast National Park,24,"Oxford, United Kingdom",5

We visited during the winter, which was nice because the park wasn't too crowded and we were able to drive and park easily at each of the view points. The light snow on the rocks added some nice contrast to the scenery. Would have loved to hike one of the trails through the canyons and hoodoos, but it was much too cold for me.

Spectacular scenery with so many vantage points along the rim trail for photo opportunities. The canyon views from the rim walk are beyond description and there are several observation points located strategically along the rim. There a few guard rails (mostly at the designated observation points), so you have nothing between you and the canyon most of the time. So, common sense needs to come into play when near the canyon edges. There also several trails into the canyon that are fantastic as well that range from short to longer to suit everyone. Along with Zion National Park, these are two of the most incredible parks I have been to and they rival the Grand Canyon for sheer beauty. Highest possible recommendation.","January 4, 2015",Absolutely breathtaking landscape,317,"Bridgewater, Canada",5

Easy to reach from Las Vegas. Can easily be combined with a visit to Zion. We saw it in April: the snow adds an extra dimension to the beauty, but not all trails were accessible. In summer, it is glorious. You can almost enjoy it at ten steps from your car, but going down one of the trails for an hour really brings you to the middle of it all. This is really a place you MUST see once in your lifetime. Ruby's Inn is not the cheapest hotel in the area, but it's convenient. ","January 4, 2015",Incredible. Every time.,45,"Mortsel, Belgium",5

To get the best experience take a short hike down one of the trails into the canyon. To get up close and personal with the hoodoos and to see the walls of the canyon looming over you really makes the experience. We only had 4 days in Utah base out of Zion, so we debated whether it was worth it to blow a full day driving to Bryce. If we hadn't hiked down into the canyon we would have probably been disappointed, but the experience you get from actually being in Bryce Canyon made this one of many highlights of our trip.

However, within minutes, the rain turned to snow and the lightning started so we got out of there asap.

Camping was a little hectic because we didn't reserve a spot so we ended up camping just outside the park at an RV and Campground site.

Here are my ideas of how to enjoy it: Grab a room at Ruby's Inn, rise early to catch an unforgettable sunrise from the point named so, return to a leisurely breakfast at Ruby's, pack your drinks and a couple of bananas and take one of the incredible hikes such as Queen's Garden or Navajo Loop.There are more and you may easily combine them if you can't get enough of them, and I bet you can't. After a refreshing rest till early afternoon, you may want to mount your camera and get ready to secure your camera position at sunset point. Make sure to take your time there and watch the wonderful light transform the hodoos into one of Nature's wonders as the sun sets over the rim.

Because Bryce is at about 8500 feet, it can get cold this time of year though, and no matter when you visit, be aware that you are at higher altitude and will be getting less oxygen, leading to possible physical responses. There are many things one can do to diminish altitude discomfort or sickness, so read up before going and take it easy on the hikes climbing uphill! But do not miss Bryce.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We agreed that if you only have time to visit one of southern Utah/northern Arizona's national parks, choose this one, even over the Grand Canyon. The views and scenery can't be described; it's breathtaking. Bryce Canyon National Park has a road going through with many overlooks to stop and see, take photos or hike. The full drive takes 3-4 hours. We took a few short hikes, and want to go back for several days so we can take longer hikes. This canyon looks different just be walking a few feet one way or another, and also with the changing angle of the sun. It's probably one of the prettiest places we've ever seen, and this includes Glacier National Park and Denali National Park.","November 14, 2014",The Views Can't be Beat,97,"Elizabethton, Tennessee",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,Bryce canyon is unlike any other in Southern Utah and it should not be missed for the sheer beauty of the canyon and its sandstone formations.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Loved visiting Bryce Canyon during early June. Lots of wildlife in the park and wildflowers in bloom. Start early and take plenty of water/snacks if you plan to hike into the canyon. The views down in the canyon are very unique and different from those at the rim.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We spent a day and a half at Bryce Canyon and felt it was the perfect amount of time. We are a physically fit couple in our late 30s and wanted to do some hiking. The first afternoon we hiked along the rim trail to take in the gorgeous views of the canyon. The second day we packed a lunch and headed into the canyon to hike among the hoodoos. We were staying in Tropic so before heading into the park we hiked the Mossy Cave Trail which was pretty unimpressive - I'd skip it in the future. From Sunset Point, we headed down Wall Street and then took the Peekaboo Loop (take a right at the trail head in case you run into horses) -- it was one of the most beautiful trails I've ever been on! We then connected with the Queen's Garden Trail on the way back up and out. Take a trail map! The trails are named but they don't have ""you are here"" maps along the trail... quite a few people were lost and had to borrow ours to figure out where they were going. That afternoon we took the scenic drive -- Bryce Point is spectacular and we could see where we hiked on the Peekaboo Trail earlier that day.","November 9, 2014",Awesome hikes/views in late October,11,"Carlton, Minnesota",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is truly breathtaking - there is no other place quite like it on earth. The rock formations are extraordinary. There are many wonderful lookout places over the canyon, but to experience it properly hike down into the canyon among the hoodoos.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We went in late October, and while the weather was cool it was perfect for hiking, and there were a lot fewer people there than in the summer. Bring gloves, hat, and jacket, and sturdy boots if you're going to hike. If you only have one day for a hike, descend the switchback Navajo trail from Sunset Point, cut over to the Peekabo Loop for three miles of up-and-down goodness (clockwise is best for views), then return via Queen's Garden, and climb back up to Sunrise Point. From there it's a half mile stroll back to your start point. That whole loop should take 4 to 5 hours, depending on how many photos stops you make (recommend LOTS); you will wind in, over, and around the hoodoos, instead of just looking at them from the rim. Stay at one of the hotels near the park entrance (or at the Lodge) and make sure to get up before dawn to see the sunrise over the canyon - just gorgeous. Bonus: if you enter the park before sunrise you won't have to pay the $25 fee since the booth doesn't open until later in the morning!","November 6, 2014",Amazing scenery,30,"Syracuse, NY",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon was a definitely a stop we wanted to make on our road trip around the Southwest area, while we were visiting Las Vegas in October 2014. We drove there after visiting Zion National Park. It was spectacular! Looking out across the Canyon, with the incredible rock formations, hoodoos, and so many lookout vantages was really something. Reminded me of the Alberta Badlands. We trekked all along the rim of the Canyon, covering Sunrise Point, Sunset Point, Inspiration Point, Bryce Point, etc. The walk was absolutely invigorating, with the clear skies, sun shining down and a breeze blowing...but the elevation was certainly something that made us short of breath at times, especially going all the way up to Inspiration point. I think the highest elevation was 8300 feet at Bryce Point. We did not trek down into the actual Canyon to be up close to the rock formations, but you could see lots of people with hiking gear and staffs down below on the trails doing just that. Plenty of parking at all the points when driving around (as it was the off season and there was no shuttle) and each point had information stations where you could read about the history of the area/geology, etc. Also a great opportunity to see native bird species; I saw a Clark's Nutcracker, Common Ravens, etc. make a point to go to Bryce Canyon for sure as you will not be disappointed. Entrance fee of $25 for private vehicles.","November 6, 2014",Spectacular!,28,"Varney, Canada",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Having visited all southern Utah's National Parks and Monuments on a eight week trip to the area recently, Bryce stands out as the ""fairyland"" park. It deserves two days for those that like to do some hiking and for those that could quite easily tent but due to cold or wet weather or just want a bed to sleep in for a change, the Bryce View Lodge located very close to the park at $45 + tax per night is a good option and good value. Hike the 6 mile Fairyland loop early in the morning and not only will you see few people but you will not have to pay the $25 park entry fee as the hike starts outside the pay booth. The afternoon can be spent either driving to the various lookouts in the park (fee now needs to be paid) or visiting nearby Red Canyon which offers single track mountain biking and various hiking trails and much more solitude. The following day can be spent hiking Bryce's Navajo, Peekaboo and Queen's Garden loops for approximately 10 miles, however be warned that Peekaboo is up and down much more than is Fairyland. These hikes should also be done early in the day if one wants to avoid the crowds. If 10 miles is too long, skip Peekaboo and just do the Navajo trail down and the Queen's Garden up.The nearby Red Canyon offers some hiking trails and single track mountain biking and one of Utah's ""classic"" single track rides just happens to end or start just across and down from the Red Canyon Visitor Centre. A shuttle really helps make this a much easier ride if available, which I had as my wife does not mountain bike.Finally, just north of Bryce a few miles off Scenic Highway 12 on the right side of the road is another nice little hike up a small river.","November 5, 2014","Arches, Southern Utah's ""Fairland"" National Park",26,Orillia,5

The sun was setting so we couldn't go too far down. Overall Bryce is definitely a place that all Americans should see at least once in their lifetime - it is amazing.

The visitors center can show you the easy to difficult trails into the canyon. Find time for a ranger talk that takes you along the rim and describes the formation of the hoodoos and how they are ever changing. If you want to stay in the Lodge at the park - book early.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Great and unusual National Park that is definitely in the backcountry. It is great for hiking as well as photography. The hiking trails are well groomed, but because of the steepness and the drop-offs at the edges of the trails, it takes some getting used to particularly if you are accustomed to the eastern US. The geology and colors of the landscape are definitely unique. It is much different visually from the Grand Canyon and its scale is much, much smaller. There is no water associated with the Canyon and it is a high desert climate. We hiked in late October and the air temperature were mid to low 60s and we felt it was perfect. I would not necessarily want to do the same hiking during the heat of the summer. It is dry and you have to make sure you drink lots of water even when the temperature is moderate. It also tends to be a little on the dusty side. Bryce also gives you a new-found liking for hiking or trekking poles. They are definitely a benefit particularly when hiking up and out of the canyon-- they take some load off of your legs and help a lot with balance.

The color and beauty has me at a loss for the right words. I just stood there in awe.Ok, once I got over the spectacular view, I became aware of the steep cliffs (just kidding). If you have problems with height like myself, don't skip this because of that. I was able to stay back and still walk along the top rim and appreciate the beauty..just stay back..I was surprised by the amount of people who allowed their kids to get close to the edges as well as their dogs. Made me very nervous. These cliffs are straight drop offs...I was unable to go on any trails which was disappointing because it would have been great to walk in the canyon, but that's my problem.","October 21, 2014",Stunning!,64,"Rochester, New York",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Our second trip to Bryce Canyon and just as awesome, breathtaking and amazing as our first trip. Follow the drive to the various Points after you stop by the Visitors Center and come early for the best views of the hoodoo's at sunrise. Early morning and late afternoon brings out the wildlife and my favorite is the Utah Prairie Dog area. They pop up and down and scurry around from hole to hole.This year we did a few walks on the paved paths, short and very easy. At the very least, get out and view each and every Point on the map. Inspiration Point is a must, even if you have to rest every few minutes. That view is overwhelmingly awesome. We walked among the hoodoo's at Mossy Cave but were not impressed. Next year we will do the walk down among the hoodoo's from Sunset Point.We visited in October when the weather was getting cooler and the crowds were smaller. Even a bit later would be a great time to hike the shorter trails. Water stations are everywhere so take advantage of them and bring snacks. Higher elevations may cause some seniors like us a few problems but going slow and drinking plenty of water kept hubby and I comfortable and symptom free the whole wonderful day.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Absolutely breathtaking views from the viewing vistas. Took the advice I read in the literature and drove to the last vista in canyon and then visited the others on the way back out to the entrance. By doing so a right turn was made into each viewing area versus having to cross traffic to park. Do not miss the opportunity to walk down into the canyon. One popular trail is the Navaho loop. We visited in October and crowds were not too bad. I would not want to be there during peak times because I can only imagine how crazy traffic might be when it gets crowded which would make it very difficult to park. ,"October 19, 2014",Do not miss!,1,"Shawnee, Kansas",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"You can do this park briefly and see amazing sights. If that is all you have time for, don't miss the wonder. But if you plan more days here, you will find more to amaze and inform you.First - find every opportunity you can to learn from rangers.The rim walk - ranger Duff (Sean Duffy) was wonderful. He was knowledgeable about the geology, the plant life, the animal life, and stories shared by the Indians who first lived in these lands. He was engaging, informative and had a great sense of humor, also a terrific story teller. The geology talk - the park has a resident geologist who shared with us more depth about the formation of the hoodos and why Bryce is so unique (it is not, as it turns out, a true canyon). He also had many models of dinosaurs which inhabited the area. Fascinating.The evening astronomy program - Bryce is the second darkest spot in the continental US. Our ranger told us about the history of astronomy, how Bryce is the location for an annual astronomy conference, then he shared photos taken from the Hubble telescope. If you felt small and insignificant already in the context of Earth geologic history, you could really feel small in the context of the inconceivable size of space. Unfortunately the night was cloudy so there was not much to see from the telescopes set out at the visitor center after the show.Remember you are at 8000 feet elevation. At most canyons in southern Utah, you start your hike at the bottom, climb up, then back down. Here you start at the plateau and hike down, then back up. Don't go further down than you can walk back up. There is not much air to breathe here. Take plenty of water and rest when you need to.That said, take a hike. The perspective from among the base of these formations is even more astounding than the view from the rim.","October 19, 2014",Spend some time here,260,"Salem, Oregon",5

If have been to the grand canyon, horse canyon, Zion and Page Bryce canyon has to be on the list, if you haven't been to any of them make your list now you could do them all in a week.","October 19, 2014",Awsome as the sun comes up,79,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",5

This was our 6th stop in Utah and our 8th National Park and it was like nothing we've ever seen.

Best way to see it is to get below the rim and hike. We did the Fairyland hike which was a nice long hike with incredible views the whole time and was not very crowded. A great place to lose yourself in. We also did the hike below the rim between sunset and sunrise points which had incredible natural art to see and photograph but was busier. The town close to Bryce (Ruby's i think?) was pretty touristy with very little variety in food so it was adequate for 2-3 days before we tired of it.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We just enjoyed the perfect visit to Bryce. We arrived from Jacob Lake in the early afternoon after spending 3 days at the North Rim. After a quick stop at the Visitor Center to get maps, advice, and watch the video, we had just enough time to drive to Bryce Point and walk along the rim, to Inspiration and Sunset Point, where we met up with a ranger for the 4:00 Rim Walk to Sunrise Point. The talk gave us just the background we needed. The second day we hiked the Navajo Trail (in the recommended clockwise direction), then we did part of the Queen's Garden Trail. Just time for a sandwich at the General Store before heading over to the lodge for our 3.5 hr trail ride into Peek-a-Boo Canyon. Great fun! A post-ride soak in the jacuzzi soothed away any soreness. But the highlight of our trip was the Fairyland Loop hike on the 3rd day. I was wary since it was classified as ""strenuous"" but it wasn't difficult, even for this 70- something year-old body. And oh, so beautiful. We did it counter clockwise, startong from Sunset Point. Not to be missed. When I describe our visit as ""perfect"" I'm not thinking of accommodation or food. Not many choices there. We stayed at Ruby's. We usually stay in small hotels or BandBs, so Ruby's was a culture shock. But we did have a nice room with a lovely view of the lake, in the --Lakeview Lodge! We watched the stunning sunsets right from our room. We also ate at Ruby's. The first night (a Tuesday) was nightmarish- enormous line up at. 8:00 with equivalent noise and bustle. We ordered off the menu, sharing a forgetable trout and a pecan salad that should have been ""lightly dressed"" but was in fact smothered. The waitress agreeably replaced it. To beat the crowds we went the next 2 nights at 4:45 and found you can get the lunch buffet (which supposedly ends at 4:00) as well as the dinner buffet, which starts at 5:00, for the price of the lunch ($14 instrad of $22). Now that was a deal and we managed to find enough things to eat. Don't count on much in the way of vegies tho! Pig out on desserts instead.

We flowed suggestions to avoid park congestion and parked at Ruby's Inn and used the Bryce Canyon Shuttle. It was an excellent choice for us. Upon the suggestion of the driver, we took the shuttle to Bryce Point for our first stop. It was very easy to enjoy each stop at our leisure, not have to worry about parking and hop on the next shuttle to the next stop. The shuttles passed by on a regular basis and the drivers offered various bits of information and answered questions. The vistas and colors were extremely impressive as were the hoodoos and other formations created by wind and water.After our stop at Sunset Point , we walked the easy but impressive rim trail to Sunrise Point. You are constantly reminded to hydrate yourself and at 8000 + feet, that is a great idea.We eventually stopped at the Visitor Center and then at Ruby's Inn before leaving . Ruby's Inn has a restaurant that seemed very popular , a small grocery store and a gift shop.

The Shuttle service is great, very regular and reliable, every fifteen minutes or so, although the start/ finish times will not allow you to see sunrise/sunset, in October at least. You will certainly do a lot more walking if you use the Shuttle service, but you will also see more and get more of a feel for this beautiful park.We did the Rim walk, starting at the Visitor Centre and walking out to Bryce point, on the first day. This takes in all the main 'sights' and gives you a good orientation. We also found time for one of the shorter 'loops' down into the canyon, from Sunset Point. This is an absolute must. We were stunned when we got down into the canyon. It was not what we imagined and you cannot tell from the Rim how beautiful it is down there!On our second day we decided to do a longer hike and we did the Fairyland loop which took us about four hours. This is great because you get away from the crowds (especially between Sunset Point and Sunrise point). I don't think we saw more than about thirty people on the whole walk.

We started at the Sunrise Point. The view of the Amphitheater at the highest view platform took my breath away at first sight! From there, we hiked the Queens Garden/Navajo Loop trail that took us down and up close with the hoodoos and to the Sunset Point and then back to Sunrise Point. Fantastic trail, and it's one of the best I had hiked. At the end of the Queen's Garden trail, be sure to check out the Queen who was high up there in all her glory and divinity. The Sunset Point offers sweeping view of the Amphitheater and beyond, equally perhaps more awe-inspiring. For me, it was amazement at every turn or sight.We then drove to explore the Inspiration Point and the Bryce Point. After completing the main section of the Amphitheater, we drove all the way to the rainbow Point and then turned back to explore the other view points on the other side of the road.

It's unique and well hidden away between other natural beauties. But still, it steels the show from the rest of them.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Unlike my other trips , I hadn't done much research when we went to Bryce Canyon, but I was left speechless.On our way there itself we were able to get a glimpse of what was ahead.There are lot of points from where you can look down like Bryce Point,Sunset Point,Sunrise Point to name a few.There is also a rim walk that gives you a good glimpse of what all the hype is about.There is shuttle service that you can take from outside, and it will take you around and you can get down where you want to.If you are fit, you shouldn't miss the chance to hike.We wanted to hike and soak in as much as we could so we did the 8 loop, which is basically parts of three hikes merged together.We went down from Navajo trail, which takes you to horse shoe trail( which is a loop ) and on your way back you can go on to queen's garden.The trail isn't easy but the views make it worth it.Make sure to carry your water, sun glasses, caps and some protein bars and a walking stick if you prefer.You will come across some stunning views, and at every turn there is something new to take your breath away.The trail takes you in the heart of the canyon and at some places you can see where the looking points are, and how far down you are.There are horse rides also offered which take you on almost the same trail, so in case you don't want to walk but still want to see the canyon, it could be a good option for you.All in all, the hike is hectic but worth the effort.","October 7, 2014",be prepared to be stunned,34,Flagstaff,5

We hiked the Navajo Loop trail. Sensible shoes are a must if you are doing the hike; the soil is claylike and was a little slippy (due to the rain) when we visited.Its worth bearing in mind the altitude too. The descent into the canyon was fine, but walking back up was a little heavy going (for me) due to feeling short of breath.

The colors vary with the time of day and the season, but whenever you visit, be sure to walk down amongst the pillars that soar above your head and explore the narrow channels, cool in the desert heat, as each turn brings a new vista. It is always worth a special visit if you are within a day's driving distance. It can adequately be seen in half a day, and Zion National Park is relatively close, so many combine the two locations in a day. Zion does have more hiking options, so those so inclined might spend more than a day there. But don't miss Bryce Canyon. A camera will not be able to fully capture it's intriguing beauty and charm.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This place is stunning. Stunning. Absolutely shockingly beautiful. You imagine it must have thousands of years of myth and history attached to it. For the most part the people that run it aren't interested in telling you that myth and history. Probably because a great deal of it was lost as it was passed down orally. So it is named after some farmer who lived near it a couple of hundred years ago.They've poured loads of concrete on the paths so people can zoom around on their rascals. It's crowded, even midweek. If you've got time perhaps you can disappear a bit down a trail, but the trails often seem to be concreted too so people can wander along in their sandals dropping crisp packets.It's still stunning though.

The day we went was rather warm but not oppressive. I will tell you that, if you are affected by high altitudes, make sure that you plan to take your time when walking or hiking at Bryce Canyon. We hiked the Queens Garden Trail and the last 300 feet of that trail is a steep incline which will make you breathe deeply to get some oxygen. I don't recommend strenuous hiking here for people who do not walk a lot. If you don't want to hike, you can get plenty of photos and see plenty of the canyon from the lookouts and from the rim of the canyon so don't worry about not seeing anything if you don't hike, it is still worth the trip.","October 2, 2014",The best of all,134,"York, PA",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Travelling from Lake Powell to Bryce Canyon (storms still chasing us - flooding & landslides could cause problems but fingers crossed) - through Red Canyon & the Hoodoos to Bryce Canyon - the scenery begins to change, the rock formation take on a different hue and the vibrancy of the red sandstone and the wind & rain erosion create the wonderful shapes of the Hoodoos and then the road climbs up to Bryce Canyon at 8,300 feet be sure that you drink plenty of fluids - I found Gatorade/PowerAde very good to settle 'dizzy spells' all worth it as the razor sharp canyons come in to view -totally incredible - the shapes the clarity of the air makes for great photographs - the Navajo Trail isn't for the faint hearted it is very a very steep drop - so take care - although the guides are fantastic and in the event of an accident (which we witnessed) they were very efficient and arrived at the scene quickly - hopefully it was a good outcome for the young lady injured. The scenery just gets better as you go through the canyons - We left Bryce Canyon and travelled on to Ruby's Inn very comfortable and a fantastic 16oz T-Bone Steak in the restaurant - woke up 5.30am to an amazing view of million of bright stars I have never seen Orion's Belt as clear in Europe & clear skies - breath-taking - we left Ruby's to have to return to Page/Flagstafff due to landslides & flooding in Zion Canyon.","September 30, 2014",Still climbing,8,"Kenmare, Ireland",5

Best of all, if you have your American Eagle Geezer Pass it is all free!The first thing I would suggest is to stop at the visitors center to get oriented, then drive the road all the way to Bryce point, just to get a lay of the land. There is a nice hike out to Bryce Point . We did several wonderful hikes -- if you are sea level folks like we are, the elevation makes the uphill a bit of a challenge but worth every step. Take water and snacks and wear decent shoes...we saw people in flip flops and Crocs and that seemed dangerous in some spots.You can walk the rim starting just about anywhere and it is a great walk. The loop down Wall Street and back up Queens garden was really fun -- the diversity of hikers was amazing, from babies in backpacks to elders with canes, all enjoying the spectacular geology. Because they have a great shuttle system you can do an extended walk by parking at Sunrise and taking the bus up to Bryce Point, then go down the Peekaboo Loop Trail -- you could go back up the loop but if you go through the canyon you will link up to Queens Garden trail -- I think a much less strenuous way out than going back up Peekaboo loop.  We had one morning of torrential rain and took in the ranger geology talk -- that was really worth doing. The interpretive signs and the park brochure are very good but she really added some information that made it all make sense. We also went to Mossy Cave in the rain...I would save myself for another hike...that one didn't do much for me.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Very unique scenery - better seen via the trails than just the shuttle stops. This park was probably our least favorite out of Capitol Reef, Bryce, and Zion, simply because it was the most crowded. Since you don’t have to work for the views (meaning there are lots of scenic overlooks easily accessible by car/shuttle and a short walk) this place is a magnet for the huge tour busses. We hiked the Navajo/Queens Garden loop from Sunset to Sunrise points, which was a nice 2-3ish hour jaunt. The steep parts are down into and up out of the canyon, in between is relatively easy hiking. This is a very popular trail, so it was crowded – not so much that we couldn’t hike at our own pace but crowded enough that it distracted from the natural setting. We ate lunch at the lodge – would definitely recommend ordering from the menu and skipping the buffet (it looked pretty sad!) Video at the visitors center was good.

Hoodoos are so neat to look at from above and also from their midst. Every turn presents something of tremendous visual interest. The park is well-maintained. They have interesting ranger led programs. We did the Native people star talk.The one thing I will say is be patient if you take the tour that goes by bus to the further reaches of the canyon. Pick up was late, but the narrator/tour leader, Spike, is a good guy and very interesting. You should also buy a Utah truffle from the gift shop. So delicious I looked them up and their distributors and got them outside the national park (cheaper) and brought them back to work, where they were immediately eaten. Fairyland is pretty. We went back after we had already been to the main park and the ampitheatre. It is similar, but smaller in scale. If you have a park pass and have to pick one, pick the amiptheater. If you do not have a park pass and want to get a taste of the beauty that is in the park, but your really can't afford it, look for the turnoff to Fairyland before you enter the main park.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I brought my parents to Southern Utah for their 50th anniversary to visit the Mighty 5. Bryce was our 3rd stop along the way. The vistas and viewpoints are absolutely breathtaking, and seem to change as the sunshine of the day progressed. We hiked the Najavo Loop which winds down to the bottom where you are gazing upward at terrestrial looking terrain. The hiking path starts winding upward and posed to be a bit of a challenge for my elderly mother who isn't used to the elevation difference being from Michigan. We visited mid-week and not during a holiday so there were no crowds. Bryce is easy to get around and has convenient viewing areas which makes it very easily accessible for anyone. The views are not something that will be forgotten. I also recommend driving through Red Canyon if in the area, and be sure to stop at Mossy Cave just outside of the park for some great photos!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"The rock features at Bryce are utterly extraordinary, and it is in many ways a more remarkable place to visit than the Grand Canyon. You can see plenty of pictures of the pinnacles (""Hoodoos"") on the web, but that cannot replace the experience of being there looking down on them or walking among them. Breath-taking? Well yes, unless you are acclimatised to altitude, you must take care at 8,000 feet plus, but the effort is more than worth while.The shuttle bus service is good, moving you between those lookout points you may find too far to walk to. Wild life is abundant, flora and fauna, delightful flowers, eagles, chipmunks and squirrels everywhere. Look out for the considerable number of trees that have been struck by lightning, and also the weird shapes that some of the old trees have formed. Fascinating.","September 20, 2014",Breath-taking in every way imaginable!,27,"Huntingdon, United Kingdom",5

We also hiked down into the hoodoos via Navajo Trail to Queen's Garden Trail and were glad we did see them from this different perspective.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"The views at Bryce Canyon are just awesome...from every view point..IF you get a parking spot with your RV. Each view point just has a few parking spots anyway and just 2 view points have space for RVs (of course, these are taken by cars..thanks). So if you dont travel with a pet, leave your RV at the entrance and use the shuttle. If you travel with a dog you can just take your dog to the paved viewpoints and not hike down...not even with your dog in a bag because ""the dog can go pee"". What!?

The farther out you go on the scenic rim drive the better it gets. The erosion of the hoodoos gets better and better and by the time you get to rainbow point you are high enough to see forever.We were surprised to see so much wildlife as well. Lots of mule deer and pronghorn in the meadows close to the road.Be sure to stop at the overlooks and get out of the car. Yes, you can see some of it from the parking areas, but you are going to miss far too much of what you came to see. Each section has a slightly different set of hoodoos, so take your time and see them all. You can see almost everything in a day and a half day is doable if you push a bit.A great park with plenty of color and diversity among the sandstone features.","September 17, 2014",You really should see this.,128,Chapel Hill,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce and Zion are my new favorite national parks. Coming from the East coast, it was quite a difference to see the beautiful colors and learn about the different rock formations. In Bryce seeing the Hoodoos was truly an amazing exhibit of nature at its best. Experiencing thunder and lightning in the park, as well as a hailstorm while on the trail, makes you feel so insignificant. We signed up in advance for a bus tour in the park, and the driver, Jay, was very knowledgeable. This was a free tour and anyone going there should not miss the opportunity to learn something about the park.

The paths are easy going and I recommend to take the long trip which will take you in about 3 hours through the canyon. If you have a bad condition, don't worry. The view is great and you can go across the rim without any problem. It is on the rim side kinda flat so you won't exhaust. Though you should go in the canyon. There is enough too see, small paths, lot's of trees and different landscapes. The hard part was taking the path upwards, which was very steep.

A tram driver told us Memorial Day weekend was the heaviest visiting day. We almost didn't find a place to park, as the campground lots were all full already. The hoodoos, the canyon's main feature, are constantly changing. That means you could go back in a few years and the sites would be different.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"If you've seen the Grand Canyon, and you were awed by the immensity of it, Bryce Canyon will awe you for the intricacy of the tall formations in reds and oranges that rise up from the canyon floor like chess pieces on a board. They are called hoodoos. Truly, you will feel like you are looking at dozens of Disneyland castles from above as each spire is uniquely carved from the sandstone. Yet, step back, and beyond the curtain of ponderosa pines, you will think this is just another forest. It is magical! There are trails through different levels of the canyon, each well marked - 65 miles of hiking trails. Bryce has bathrooms, shops, facilities and campgrounds at various viewing points along the road that follows the canyon's rim. The elevation is up to 8300 feet. We stopped at Fairyland Point and Sunset Point, places where the bus could easily navigate in and out. Some of the access roads to various points may be closed during the winter due to snow conditions.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited Bryce Canyon in mid-August 2014. This was our third visit, and it was as awe-inspiring as the previous two visits. The hoodoos (spires and arches caused by weathering) are unique, varying in color from cream to peach to deep rust. With the mountain scenery in the background, Bryce Canyon is a must-see if you are in southwest Utah.The entrance fee is $25 for 7 days. Consider staying in the park or in Ruby's Inn nearby. There is no Wi-Fi, no TV, little cell service and no national newspaper available in the park. You are truly part of nature without the distractions of modern life.Our only complaint was the pizza at Valhalla Pizza: the crust tasted like cardboard and the sauce had no flavor.

Having toured through Zion and Moab we found Bryce just as stunning and breath taking but for different reasons. Bryce is full of Hoodoos and gives you a different perception of the vast mountainous ranges in this area. I am not good with heights and some of the pathways I could not walk as there were no barriers between you and the cliff edge. However this did not detract from my enjoyment and the fantastic views.

You might not even know it was gone because your eyes, ears, and heart will be so drawn to the majesty of this place. Try to schedule your visit for early morning or in the late afternoon. The boring visit will allow you more time to wander the many spectacular observation points along the rim. Be aware that most of the rim does not have a fence. Keep an eye on children. The afternoon visit might bring you the incredible scene of an on-rushing thunderstorm. The colors come alive in the shadows and brilliant spots of sunlight.

Didn't take away from the experience though. Many lookout points to take fantastic photos, lots of opportunity to hike away from the rim and see the flora and fauna while trying to find shuttle stops (I also have horrendous sense of direction).

At night the dark skies overhead are truly awe inspiring, by day the hoodoos are incredible. I enjoyed hiking down into the canyon, but choose your route up with care. Even for seasoned hikers the ascent can be difficult due to the high altitude and some routes are very, very steep. A day and night in Bryce is plenty of time to see the main points of the park. This trip is really only for nature enthusiasts as there is little to do beyond hiking and viewing wildlife.

You can see more stars at Bryce than anywhere else in the United States. One warning - do not take the helicopter tour offered at Ruby's. The pilot is more like a bus driver than a tour leader. He won't let you ask questions; he just tells you how smart he is. It isn't worth the money. Take the canyon drive and stop to see all the overlooks. Pace yourself and take as many hikes as you can.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Although the view from the top of Bryce Canyon is wondrous, to truly experience the beauty of this national park one must be adventurous and hike the numerous trails through-out. The Navajo Loop paired with the Queens Garden is a must and truly beautiful. I recommend starting at Navajo Loop and working back as the climb back up is less strenuous. The hike from Sunset Point to Fairyland Point is also very a beautiful hike but with totally a different venue as there is not that much traveled relatively speaking but it gives one total serenity. Also be advised if you hike from Sunset Point to Fairyland point there is no tram pickup here. I would recommend the hikes to most people as they can be strenuous at times but please make sure you have adequate footwear as flip-flops, dockers etc are an accident just waiting to happen. Plan on spending at least 3 days here as there are other hikes throughout and if you are not used to hiking you may over do it.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce is like Sedona on steroids. It is totally different from Zion. It has the color and flavor of Sedona but only 1000% better. Our tour guide (Southwest Adventure Tours) led us to all the must-see points and identified them all (we liked Thor's Hammer and the Queen's Garden). And our trek took us down to the floor of the canyon (OMG!! It is really far away!) and no elevators back up! The air is thin there so pace yourself, stop when necessary (as we doubt that the 911 medi-vac helicopters would be able to reach you), and wear sturdy shoes (leave the sandals and flip-flops in the car).What eye-candy! We had the best time making up our own names for things and could almost make out enough ""hoodoo"" rock formations to identify as chess pieces. Those hoodoo formations even looked like remnants of an ancient civilization; we're sure we could make out a ""castle"" in one of the hoodoo arrangements. From Sunrise Point, our guide said we could get the best bird's eye view of these marvels. He was so right, we loved it and could have stayed there the rest of the day, drinking it all in.The beautiful red colors, the outstanding scenery, the gargantuan proportions ... there really is nothing like it anywhere. The large-sized mules are one way to transport visitors to the canyon bottom (they are a blend of a Clydesdale mare and a donkey sire). We saw the parade heading down.If you can, try to get a National Parks map for Bryce. The Ranger hands one to you when you check in the park but having it in advance would be even more helpful.

This is a neat place to visit and it has a camp ground if you want to camp. The sand is so mine, all of this is an easy drive from Las Vegas (3 hours to Kanab) A 4 cylinder car will burn about 2 tanks round trip to Zion and Bryce Canyons. We stayed in Holiday Inns Express but there are numerous chains and some good looking locals.

Beware that because it is early in the season some parts of the park are still closed.I recommend doing the Queens Garden/Navajo Peak hike (3 miles), it is not terribly strenuous, but if you have trouble with stairs you could have a hard time getting down into the canyon.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited a lot of canyon parks on our 2 week tour. Zion was our favorite but Bryce takes the prize for pure visual beauty and the genius of nature. As stated in the title, my wife already put up 2 pics outside our bedroom.The park is excellent when viewing in the morning and evening but even in midday sun the formations are very cool and change sometimes almost by the minute. You can see something, take a picture, then a few minutes later put the camera up again, frame the same composition, and it looks different. Only in Bryce. Maybe Badlands in SD is similar but Bryce is more colorful. We stayed in the cabin area and it was only a couple strides away from the edge. Very cozy in the cabin, probably a great spot for a cold night in winter snow. Walking around to view the main hoodoo formations is generally easy. Lots of overlooks and benches to rest. The drive south into the park to see other hoodoos is also easy and rewarding.We had dinner at the pizza joint and found surprisingly good pizza out in the middle of nowhere. Speaking of which, since you are out in the middle of nowhere..it is extremely dark and perfect for star gazing. We had the constellation app up and saw a galaxy on the screen...I put up my binoculars and looked into one of the eyepieces (so like a mini telescope) and eventually (took longer than expected) we found and could see a blurry, smeared light. Not a star, the Andromeda Galaxy! Totally awesome. For East Coasters like us just seeing the Milky Way in full glory is a treat...to see another galaxy was the bomb.We also did the half day horseback ride into the canyon and enjoyed a different view of the canyon. Family loved the horseback ride. We had a great guide named Bo who helped my 10 yr. old daughter. She was very nervous at the beginning but was a pro by the time we got back.I did get up early one morning and descend sharply, but only for a short while, down into the canyon at Sunset Point. The Navajo Loop I believe. That area is a great spot for pictures and early morning/evening hikes...I guess you could say that pretty much about the entire park!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Family of four (sons 15 and 11) were staying on the east side of Zion National so we decided to drive up to Bryce Canyon last Monday. It was around a 2 hour drive. Lots of bike paths leading into Bryce so if you are biking enthusiasts bring your bikes. We stopped at the Visitor Center to recycle our bottles and use the restrooms. Bring your National Park Passport books to get them stamped with the park stamp. Also if you plan to do Bryce, Grand Canyon, and Zion like we did, each will cost you $25 and you can get an annual National Park pass that basically lasts you for ~13 months for $80. We paid the $25 at Zion but they let us upgrade to the $80 annual pass by just paying the difference when we entered Grand Canyon North Rim. We plan to do Yosemite next August and our pass is good until the end of August so we will get four parks for $80.After our stop at the visitor center, we drove to the Sunset Point stop and found plenty of parking at 9:30 a.m. We did the Navajo Loop/Queens Garden/Sunrise Point trail highlighted in the National Park guide. As suggested in other reviews, start at the Navajo Loop side because the descent is much steeper and exit the Sunrise point side because it is a more gradual ascent (the guide says go clockwise – do not listen to the guide). The hike took us 1 ½ hours. After we got back, we just left our car parked at Sunset Point and walked over to the Bryce Canyon Lodge and had the buffet lunch. I think adults were ~$15 and kids ~$8 and that included drinks. There were sloppy joes, BBQ pork sandwiches, a really awesome vegetable beef soup (I normally don’t like this kind of soup but it was the best I have ever had), tuna salad, chicken salad, build your own sandwich, fruit, lettuce, etc. It opened at 11:30 and it was not very busy when we arrived. As we were leaving Sunset Point, the National Park police were closing Sunset point because there was too much traffic and diverting anyone trying to enter to other parking locations.We then drove to the very end of the park (Rainbow & Yovimpa Points) and then stopped at the scenic overlook points on the way back since they will be on your right side and easier access. The scenic drive was not busy at all. All the stops were beautiful. We all agreed that Bryce Canyon was our favorite park over Zion and Grand Canyon. Don’t miss this park.","August 17, 2014",Bryce Canyon not to be missed,168,"Kansas City, Missouri",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,The views over the canyon were amazing! Shuttle buses took you round the National Park so there was no problem with car parking.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce is unlike any other park, so should not be missed. Like others, we highly recommend doing the Queens Garden trail starting at Sunrise Point, and then joining up with the Navajo Loop trail exiting at Sunset Point. You can then either take the shuttle between the points, or just walk--it's short and pretty. Make sure to take plenty of water, and just take your time, because the altitude and heat can definitely get to you. But it's doable by most people in reasonable health. The views from the various points along the drive are worth seeing, but there's nothing like actually walking down into the canyon. They have free shuttle buses and we recommend using them because the traffic is insane and you can't find places to park. They may need to do like Zion and require the shuttle buses.","August 16, 2014",My favorite park!,210,United States,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Unlike Zion National Park, you can drive the 18 miles of Bryce Canyon. We planned for one and a half days at Bryce. The first afternoon we drove in and went to the visitors center where we got our maps and started to make our plan. The park ranger we spoke to suggested that the next day we shuttle in as parking can be crazy between 9 and 4. The Map, shuttle & hiking guide was perfect!!! We used page 4... I hiked the hoodoos program. It was just myself and my 8 year old son. Our first late afternoon we decided to drive out the 18 miles and stop and overlooks and shuttle in the next day. The canyon is on the left side as you drive in, so it's best to go to end and work your way back. In all...Day one we hiked: Bristlecone loop at 1 mile. At Bryce Point we walked down to the left away from all the tourists and sat on the rocks to meditate and admire the glorious view. It was stunningly breathtaking. And surprisingly quite. This was late afternoon and perfect. Day two we shuttled in. Parking at the entrance was easy and not crowded. We got there just around 930 am. Sunset to sunrise (.5 mile) continuing on to Queens garden (.9 miles) down to Navajo loop (.8 miles) and went up the Thor's Hammer side (.6 miles)We drove out to get to mossy cave a .8 mile trek. Easy and both disappointing and worth it. The cave itself isn't all that magnificent perhaps in the winter it is. However, there is a sweet little waterfall that waits for you!!!Bring plenty of water, some snacks and a long sleeve. It got chilly as the sun was going down. We also keep bandanas in our packs for sweat, bugs, and runny noses. Remember to leave no trace.","August 16, 2014",We hiked the Hoodoos!!!,25,"Lunenburg, Massachusetts",5

With a variety of rim-paths, moderate and strenuous hiking trails, Bryce is a good choice regardless of fitness level.While we did not stay in the Park, the Lodge, cabins and amenities appear to be well-appointed and if you're not a walker/hiker, you can relax in comfort in a scenic settingThe park offers many programs for children and adults. We attended the astronomy and geology talks which were very well done - presented by Park Interpreters either on the rim or at the Lodge, they are certainly targeted for children, but entertaining and informative even for adults.","August 14, 2014",Stunning scenery,16,"Mundelein, Illinois",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We ended our 2 week trip here. The nice thing was that we could drive the loop and enjoy the views without too many strenuous hikes as we were exhausted from our previous days of hiking in Zion. The most amazing thing for us was the night sky program. If you are there on a night it is offered we recommend it. The lines for the telescopes can be long, but the sky is so beautiful there that we didn't mind the wait. We got to see Saturn close-up as well as 2 universes in one view, and exploded star and others. We also saw many shooting stars while waiting to see in the telescopes. The landscape here is very unique and beautiful.","August 13, 2014",Beautiful,39,"Erwinna, Pennsylvania",5

Be warned its $25 per car load or $12 per person. Also be sure to bring lots of water as the temps in the summer can reach the 90's. If your out around dusk you will see lots of deer.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"If you are staying in or near Bryce Canyon (and it’s a huge mistake to miss this magnificent national park, so different from Zion and the Grand Canyon) and have already done some of the hikes there, don’t miss the nearby treats. The highlights: -Kodachrome State Park at sunset is a great place to hike. We did the short Shakespeare Arch - Sentinel loop and the Angel’s Palace loop. Reasonably easy hikes, great views (especially the second half of the Shakespeare-Sentinel loop), both under an hour and a half including time for lots of photos, and very different from the scenery in Bryce. The Shakespeare Arch hike rises up from the middle of the plateau, so it has expansive views in all directions and part of the landscape you look over is almost redolent of African savannah. -Rent bikes at the Sinclair Gas Station just outside of Bryce (associated with Ruby’s Inn, as is everything else in town, it appears) and have them drop you off at the paved bike path at the top of Red Canyon for a thrilling 5 miles of downhill spectacular scenery paralleling Route 12. -Have more time? Drive the breath-taking 2 hrs from Bryce to Boulder: This has to be one of the most scenic highways in the world. -The Petrified Forest State Park in Escalante provides another interesting walk: jewel-like logs embedded in the ground. (If you are expecting a forest of stone, you will be disappointed - the petrified wood that remains is all at your feet. The state park system really needs to remove the word ‘Forest’ from the name.) If you’re short of time, this is one that you could skip.-And if you get to Boulder, the Anasazi State Museum is a good introduction to the history of the Ancestral Pueblo people in the area, and the Burr Trail road provides more spectacular views. -En route, the hike to Lower Calf Creek Falls is particularly lovely at the right time of day (we did it just before sundown and the contrast between the green on the valley floor and the colors on the red rocks was gorgeous), even if you don’t walk the whole way.In short, a trip to Bryce Canyon, while a worthwhile destination in itself (and we’ve visited several times), can also be just the start of a fabulous trip through southern Utah.","August 12, 2014",Other things to do while you're at Bryce,159,Washington DC,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is one of the many beautiful places in Utah's National Parks including Zion and Moab and many others. The drive there is very beautiful, particularly from Colorado- so many beautiful rock formations on the way! We drove from the Central Coast of California and made it in one day, although we set up camp in the dark. It is pretty high elevation, so beware because it is a little cooler than you would expect, year-round. The park is situated in sort of a North-South configuration, so we drove to the most southern point and drove up the way, stopping and taking pictures. Driving from the most southern point, it seems that all or almost all of the attractions are on the right, so you don't have to cross traffic at each stop (making it very convenient to see them all!) It might even get more beautiful the farther north and toward the entrance, but it's all so magnificent it's difficult to tell! We visited during the monsoon rains, so it was nice to be able to see everything from our car during the rainstorms and then hike between the storms. Although when we hiked peekaboo loop (strenuous), we were caught in a downpour with thunder and lightning, so I would recommend bringing an umbrella or poncho just in case because the sky can open and just dump buckets!Overall we had a wonderful trip! If you are not into camping (we had a difficult time starting our fire because of the rain) there are many little hotels and even a teepee campground up the road from the gates of the park. We hiked Peekaboo Loop, which was very beautiful and less foot traffic, but a little strenuous. There is another hike near Sunset and Sunrise Points that is less strenuous and also has very beautiful rock formations. I would recommend going on a hike, so that you can really submerse yourself in these beautiful land formations. It is so much more impressive!ALSO- you can park outside of the park and take a shuttle throughout the entire park (avoiding fees and possibly traffic to get into the park). If you arrive late, you will avoid the $20/25 per car National Park fee, which we foolishly drove out and back in because we're too honest. If you arrive late, you get in for free and they have no way to tell if you paid or didn't. If you're there during park hours in at Bryce, Zion, or even the Grand Canyon, I would recommend buying the year pass- it's only about $75-80 for an entire year and you can put two names on it. If you plan on visiting Bryce, Zion, and the close-by North-Rim of the Grand Canyon, just buy the pass and then all of the National Parks will be free to enter for the entire year, which Yosemite is also on that list and many many more. Hope this helps, have fun!","August 11, 2014","Beautiful National Park, Highly Recommended!",53,"Pasadena, California",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Really worth a visit. We were there in August, temps were up there so make sure you have plenty of h2o per person on a hike.

I am not an avid hiker but even for me it was doable. Just check the trails and it will clearly tell you what to expect. The parc was lively with animals of all kinds and also for kids lots to see and experience.Small minus point, admission is $ 25 per vehicle but gives you admission for 7 days after.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Bryce Canyon isd a touristical highlight in the Western US since over a 100 years. Nevertheless most (90+%) of all visitors just see it from the rim road and maybe the lodge area (sunrise/sunset point).My recommendation would be: take the Navajo/loop trail - after 200 yards you are alone with the spectacular forms and colors of stone. If you do it early in the morning or later in the evening the whole valley seems to be on fire - it's simply awesome.

We were supposed to run the Fairyland Loop but my husband got a toe injury that prevented us from doing much other than driving through the park and looking at the stunning scenery. The only thing that would have made this trip better would have been the accommodations. I give Bryce Canyon City 1-2 stars. The accommodations were all pretty mediocre. None of the restaurants (none anywhere) were open past 9 p.m. and when we asked about getting served right before 9, the answer was no. We scrambled to get a sandwich at the one store that was open till 9:30 p.m. Now, granted, my husband and I live in NYC where the expectation is that you can get almost anything 24/7 but when an entire town outside a major resort closes at 9 p.m., that's disappointing. We spent time in a number of other cities (Springdale, Moab, Escalante) that are all outside of parks and had much more of a nightlife than Canyon City.So, as I said above, visit the park.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"After five years we returned to Bryce Canyon and found it more spectacular than we ever remembered. This majestic landscape is formed by the erosion of water over millions of years which has carved canyons, gullies, and amazing vertical pillars of rock called Hoodoos from the surrounding plateau. We were able to take some spectacular photos from Sunrise, Sunset and Inspiration Points which encircle the Bryce Amphitheatre. The trails between these lookouts are well maintained but beware of loose gravel and sand as you climb up these pathways. Inspiration Point has an elevation of 8100ft so you may be a little breathless climbing up at this high altitude. There is very little shade so be sure to wear a hat and sunscreen.

There were so many people it sort of seemed like Disneyland. In the main amphitheater, I saw people walking down the Navajo Trail an hour before sunset, with a storm threatening, wearing flip-flops and not carrying water. Also many of the tourists were noisy and they let their kids run around and scream. It made it kind of hard to have a nature experience. Driving out to the end of the Park Road and doing some hiking there, including the Bristlecone Loop, was much more peaceful. ","July 29, 2014",Beautiful but crowded,262,"Reading, Pennsylvania",4

It's a geological masterpiece with its gallery of unique sand sculptures. You will not believe it until you see it up close, so I highly recommend hiking among the hoodoos to appreciate the beauty of the red and orange hued sandstone. We also took a canyon trail ride on horseback which is a great way to see parts of the park you can't see on foot.One thing we didn't really enjoy was how dry it was. This is definitely the desert and Bryce is one of the driest of the national parks. The trails aren't paved and the silty sand gets in everything. Invest in some good hiking shoes and leave the flip flops at home. Most of the hikes take you down into the canyon and then you have to hike back up.

Hoodoos and forest mixed together.There is no place like Bryce Canyon. Hoodoos (odd-shaped pillars of rock left standing from the forces of erosion) can be found on every continent, but here is the archetypal ""hoodoo-iferous"" terrain.

They say that there are only 1 parking spots per 4 cars trying to find parking in Bryce, but we found that not to be the case, perhaps because of the impending rain storm the day we visited.

I remember an arch, so beautiful, that it never seemed to me that nature could have carved so perfect a shape. The entire park requires about three to four hours to see and photograph.

If you're driving from Bryce Canyon down to Grand Canyon or beyond like to Flagstaff or Phoenix. There is a detour somewhere after Page on 89. You'll be detoured to 89T for a while and the highway is only 55 miles per hour even though you'll be driving through stretches of long straight road. Don't speed!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"My wife and I went on an 18 day road trip to visit western US national parks. We visited Yellowstone, the Tetons, Arches, Mesa Verde, Grand Canyon, Bryce, and Zion. While each park had its unique quality and beauty, I must say that Bryce Canyon was one of our favorites. The natural formations of the ""hoodoos"" remind me of someone at the beach dripping wet sand to form castles. These natural rock formations are amazing, and the colors are indescribable. One activity I wish we had done was to take a horse ride down to the canyon floor. That looked like it would not only be fun, but also give us a broader view of the beauty of the park. Another nice thing about the park is that you can drive right up to the lookout area, with very little hiking involved. You can also hike from one area to another, as well as hike down into the lower levels of the canyons. Bryce Canyon National Park is definitely a must see for anyone who enjoys nature.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I will humbly attempt to describe the indescribable wonders of Bryce Canyon Park. Bryce Canyon, with its red sandstone hoodoos, ancient bristlecone pines and ample wildlife is a wonder in the wonderful National Park System. The varied outlook points are well designed and accessible for a person with disabilities, as well as those desiring a healthy walk/hike. We recommend the Rainbow Point and Bristelcone Loop trails for ""easy"" hikes. The sunrise and sunset backdrops for photography are superb! Take a walk in the evening or early morn and you'll probably catch sightings of antelope and the endangered Bryce Canyon Prairie Dog. The lodge and restaurant are well maintained and a positive experience in themselves. We'd recommend you reserve lodging at the Bruce Canyon Lodge. They have suites, cabins and model-type rooms...all are comfortable and spacious...no phones or TV, but you can get WiFi at the lodge. We also enjoyed the numerous activities and ranger-sponsored events provided by the NP staff. We visited the campground and found it clean and well designed. This is just a gorgeous park, with a night sky like no other. You can catch up on your astronomy and take moonlight walks along the rim. Ensure you upload a ""star map"" or ""celestial sky"" app before arriving to receive the full effect of this night setting. I so wish our grown kids could have seen this lovely park!. It's a park for the generations, to be sure. We had a disappointing issue with the Full Moon-Like Hike activity and quickly brought it to the Park's staff for resolution.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I will just repeat what many of the other reviews state, words do not do justice to this place. Every overlook and turn along the trails provide amazing life enriching views that one will remember for the rest of your life. We spent two days hiking in the park and wish we could have spent at least another day to experience more of this sensational landscape. The entrance fee for a car is $25, reasonable once you see what the park has to offer. After we oriented ourselves with the park at the Visitor Center we got the chance to view the sun through a telescope that a few park rangers were demonstrating outside the Center. Once we finished enjoying viewing the sun we decided to go hiking. We hiked the Navajo Loop - Queen's Garden combination trail. The Navajo Loop is quite popular; it is near Sunset Point (a great overlook) and has breathtaking hoodoos, and can become crowded during the holidays. Even with a small crowd the hike is well worth it. The combination trail took about 2.5 hours, including many stops for photos. A beautiful mesmerizing landscape. After the hike we had lunch at The Bryce Canyon Lodge, which was very tasty. The following day we hiked the Fairyland Loop Trail. One of the best hikes I have ever experienced. It took us about 4 hours to complete a little over 8 miles of an up and down and windy trail. Make sure you take plenty of water with you, the temperatures can get pretty high. The landscape is indescribable. Amazing vistas at every turn. We did the hike backwards starting at Sunrise Point rather than Fairyland Point, on the advice of a park ranger, and I am so glad we did. Ascending at Fairyland Point is more gradual than at Sunrise Point. The last two miles of the trail are part of the Rim Trail, which offers spectacular canyon views. Around the 4 mile mark you are blessed with another breathtaking view of the canyon, you will not want to miss it. Our Bryce Canyon experience ended with the scenic drive. We drove to Rainbow Point first, just like the guide books tell you, and they are correct. We stopped at Rainbow Point, Agua Canyon, and Natural Bridge. I'm sure that all of the stops are great, but we figured that the views could not be better than what we saw on our hikes, plus we were pretty tired and ready to get some dinner.

If you are at the park 7:30pm or later, that is prime time to view the wildlife. Also, check out the gift shop, it is one of the best in the state parks!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is a hiker's paradise given the substantial number of self guided trails one can choose from. The overlooks are well laid out and most have nice restroom facilities. The park runs a free shuttle service that stops at the most popular overlooks all the way from Sunset out to Rainbow Point. The entrance fee is the standard $25 per vehicle good for 7 days. We did the Red Loop (Sunset, Inspiration, Bryce and Paria) first and the Green Loop last working our way back from the farthest Rainbow/Yovimpa to the entrance (this route includes Natural Bridge). We arrived early ~0800 and beat the crowd. As we departed car parking inside at the various stops was getting harder to come by. Unlike other parks though aside from restrooms there is little in the way of places to pick up water or snacks so come prepared. We also experienced a drop of 12 degrees in temp while at Rainbow Point requiring us to don jackets. As you move toward the actual Ranger entrance point you will find a road off to the left for Fairyland Canyon. It sports some nice rock formations and a restroom. Farther out, east on Hwy 12 after passing out of the park entrance and Bryce Canyon City you will find Mossy Cave. It is easy to miss as there is no signs but you will see the restroom facility and pullout. This point has a nice gravel trail that follows a settler created stream from Mossy Lake. There is a nice little waterfall about 0.4 miles out the trail.Hiking trails are abundant but would definitely require more than a day to cover them.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We spent a full afternoon/evening in Bryce, and really enjoyed it. It's one of the most unique Parks in the area, because while Zion/Grand Canyon are very similar in that they are both valleys carved out by rivers (don't get my wrong, both are amazing and very impressive), Bryce is totally unique with its spires. Looks like something you'd find in a cave almost. We drove in and drove down the main road, checking out most of the viewpoints. Our favorite was Inspiration Point. We went back later with some picnic food and beer, and sat on the rim looking out over the park as the sun set. We also did one of the 3 mile hikes, starting at Sunrise point, doing a loop down into the valley and ending at Sunset point (where we had parked). Gives a very nice perspective of the park, rather than top down, from bottom up, giving you a different viewpoint of the spires and formations.

Since all the stops are on the left side as you go out to Rainbow Point (the last stop) we drove to the end of the 18 mile drive and the worked out way back with the stops on the right side and easy to pull off to see. The hoodoos were very interesting. Our favorite stops were Rainbow Point, Inspiration Point (walk to the way top,it's not long) and Natural Bridge. At the stops you could see for miles and miles. The colors and character of the hoodoos change as the light in the sky changes. We saw a mule deer with 2 babies crossing the road.

Hiked the Rim, Navaho Loop, Sunrise & Sunset, Queens Garden, Picaboo, and returned back up via Wall Street switchbacks. This group is experienced having hiked the Smokey Mountains, Grand Tetons, and Pyranees among others. Bryce trails are wide smooth and quite level which makes the hiking easier though it is a long trek with numerous ups and downs. This is not a hike where you trudge through the forest in hopes of a few scenic vistas until reaching the top. Every turn offers a magnificent perspective. Walking along the Rim from the parking lot, hiking down into Queens Garden and the ups and downs of Picaboo (3 miles) were the highlights. The hoodoos and other rock formations are very different and interesting versus other mountain hikes we've experienced. Hydrate before and during, temperatures were comfortable due to low humidity and full sun on most of the trails.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon: Simply put, there is nothing else quite like it! It did not rise up like another one in the top three: the majestic Grand Tetons. Rather its unique beauty comes from erosion. The Hoodoos it leaves are in stark contrast to surrounding landscape. A great starting point to experience the Hoodoos up close, and is a microcosm of the park, is Fairyland Point. You can almost feel it as it is changing little by little every day. It is said that one day it may become larger than the main park itself. Fairyland Point is on a road going to the right about a quarter of the way between Ruby’s Inn and the Park’s entrance. As a photographer, I recommend the spectacular sunrises as seen starting from the top of Bryce Point Trail to Inspiration Point. This is one of the Pro’s favorite locations.Upper Inspiration Point also offers a splendid, unique panoramic view of the park and its surroundings.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Ok, the minimum since there's already several thousand comments on Bryce...We left from Phoenix and about 7 hours later (road construction delays on 89A) we were there.Your lodging choices are dictated mostly by your wallet. In the park is The Lodge, that's $185-215 a night, and they are booked up well in advance. The benefit is that you are already there! The drawback is wifi availability, just the lobby, and the cabins did t seem to have any. Restaurant is on site and expensive but pretty well reviewed.Next is right outside the park gates, Best Western is priced almost as high as The Lodge, and then there's a couple others around. All varying accommodations and prices but all over $125 a night except for Rubys rv or tent campground. You can go out several more miles and find an assortment of motels and cabins, none of which are reviewed very well, take your chances.We stayed in Panguitch, about 25 miles away, prices in the $80's, more places to eat, but lower level quality. I reviewed the PurpleSage motel elsewhere.So it all depends on how much you want to drive and spend. If I had to do it all over, instead of Panguitch I'd have tried the ones just outside the park, but this was a 2 week prior to arriving quick decision and there wasn't availability for 3 nights in a row.Bryce is beautiful, clean and well organized for tours and walking. The recommended drive is to go through the park to the very end at about mile 18, then turn around and make right hand turns into each view point or trailhead. That does work best. You van take the shuttle but we preferred the I dependence. Shuttle is free with your $25/7 day admission. One thing I noted, since the park is open 24 hours, and the admission booths are not manned till like 7 am, if you want to come in for the sunrise as we did, you'll just sail,right through the booths and pay nothing. While I do t recommend that, you can skip the admission fee if you want to arrive early.We hiked the Rim trail and the Queens Garden, both were reasonable to moderate I in how strenuous, just be sensible, take water and don't be stupid and wear flip flops. Several people were using the ski poles for balance, available at area Walmarts for about $20 a pair.The Queens Garden trail was popular but not overrun, it is the easiest trail to take, though gets wry switch-backy at times. Take the left fork and .1 tenth of a mile longer to go thru the Wall Street Canyon portion, much better than the right hand fork that is out in the open.The visitor center is a great stop for wifi, clean bathrooms and some information. Not much in the way of quality clothing though, mostly trinkets and kids stuff.Lots of foreign tourists, we heard Korean, German, French, Italian and Dutch being spoken.Big tour buses roll in and take up the hotel rooms and restaurant spaces so watch your timing. Go early in the morning and the park is quiet and the viewpoints nearly empty. We saw plenty of antelope with their new little ones. Mangy winter coats so not all that attractive to take pictures of.Temps,get quite cool, it's at altitude, like 8000 feet, so mornings are high 30's to low 40's. The winds come up and can really blow, like 25-35 mph. I almost lost my hat several times.Bring your SLR if you have one, basic point and shoot cameras or camera phones cannot take in the grandeur of the views like your human eye can.I'd rate it a 9/10. You can blow through and see everything in a a day and even get in. Hike or two but I'd recommend 2-3 days to get the full meal deal, so to speak.If you need ADA access, it is available at most all viewpoints. Not on hikes though.In summary, book your reservations for rooms well ahead, spring for The Lodge for convenience, park inside the lodge with your smaller RV or tent in the North and South campgrounds, and have a coat and hat for the early morning sunrise (5:30am and pretty) or the 8:30pm sunsets in June.Read other reviews for other details and their photos.

Our doctor knows we love to travel and he had recommended Bryce Canyon & Zion N,P. We are sure glad we took his advice. You can walk down into the canyon...but remember, if you walk down, you must also walk back up. There are, I believe,37 miles you can drive and 14 different pull offs thru out the park. I recommend giving yourself time to stop at each because each pull off is awesome and gives you a different view. Once you pay your entrance fee (or use your N.P. pass), there is a free shuttle that you can use if you don't want to drive your car. Definitely bring your camera and/or camcorder.

Be prepared for a tough hike back up! We went to Inspiration Point to catch the sunset. The colors look even better when the sun starts to go down. This is supposed to be the best place for watching the sunset, but it was not too crowded. There are 3 viewpoints so a good bit of room to spread out. Finally, we went to a ranger-led astronomy program. Bryce is so remote that it is close to total darkness.

Just walking from one end of the rim to the other is a beautiful stroll with very little effort being expended.Of course, you can hike down to the bottom but never forget that you will also have to hike back up. There are no elevators. so don't bite off more that you can chew. However, if you do go down, there are several hikes you can take on the canyon floor and others that will take you pretty far up on the other side. One, ""Peek-a-boo Loop"" is a beautiful 3.5 mile challenge for the reasonably fit. You can also do this one on horseback which looked like a lot of fun. so if you do this one, don't forgot, you still have to climb out of the canyon when you're done.Loved it.

It makes everything very easy and accessible.We stopped at a picnic area and had lunch, and that was very nice - right in the Ponderosas - had water and it was nice and cool. When we got to the lookouts, the view was spectacular! Did not go down into the canyon as I know, you have to go up. We did not have the energy or the shoes to attempt that feat. We spent about 4 hours in the park, and each place we stopped, we were in awe! This park and Arches Nat'l Park are the two best parks in the US as far as I'm concerned!!!!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"A short two hours or so from Zion, this park is otherworldly. You won't see anything like it anywhere else. Drive to the lodge (instead of taking the shuttle, and no pass is needed once in the park) and right across from the front of the lodge is the rim trails around much of the canyon where you can view ethereal columns of rock formations clustered throughout the canyon. This description is inadequate for the experience. You can walk a trail right down into the canyon if you like, but tempting as that is, remember that you must walk back up. The altitude here is high and the air is thin, so climbing can be arduous. We walked about 20 minutes one direction, came back and walked 20 minutes in the other. The lodge has a good restaurant.","June 20, 2014",Another Great National Park,23,"rockville, md",4

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We had a great time at Bryce despite the crowds. The views from the rim are stunning, particularly from Bryce Point, Inspiration Point, and Sunset Point. When you tire of walking and photographing (a camera is a must), there are places to sit on the rim and just appreciate the view and think about the forces that created this geological wonder.We especially enjoyed the one hike we had time for. It's a loop combining the Queen's Garden and Navajo Loop trails. It starts at Sunrise Point, heads down through the hoodoos and ends at an area called the Queen's Garden where there is a rock formation that looks like Queen Victoria. This is a fairly easy hike, and you can return the way you came. It's more fun to continue along the ""canyon"" bottom and join the Wall Street part of the Navajo Loop trail back to the rim. This route provides a lot more variety. The trail climbs switchbacks between vertical walls giving a bit of a slot canyon feel. When we got to the junction with the other part of the Navajo loop, we zipped down to get a closer view of the Thor's Hammer formation, returned to the rim, and walked back to Sunrise Point.It's a wonderful hike, and you lose a large part of the crowd by leaving the rim.

The drive to go to Bryce was scenic and picturesque. There were elderly who fell and slid down the downhill path. We stayed two days and went to Canyon Reef which is another picturesque destination. We hiked the petroglyphic view and the hike is definitely lighter compared to Bryce. Very memorable as well.

At Moss Cave, during the summer the water fall is beautiful. There is something about the sound of flowing water that makes everything seem more calming.Tips: It is cool here in the summer. We had low to mid 50's in June, so take a jacket, and wear longer pants than shorts. Also, it can be very windy without warning - wear sunglasses to protect your eyes from blowing dust. And definitely wear comfortable shoes, there is a significant amount of walking required. Some trails are more strenuous than others - check out online information about the difficulty of the trails.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon offers such unique formations and colors, it is just a delight to behold. You can get a pretty good experience just from the rim if you are not a big hiker, but to really feel the place you should try at least a short hike like the Navajo loop. We hiked the combo Queens Garden and Peek-a-boo loop and it was spectacular. Most of the hikes have several elevation changes throughout, so its not just a once down/once up experience. If you hike during the day I would recommend coming back at sunset to get a different and very colorful experience. Its a little easier to drive into the park and actually find a parking spot at sunset as well, so you have a better chance of avoiding the shuttle (thought the shuttle is very good). The shuttle runs from outside of the park going south and stops only at the visitor center and at Sunset campground before going all the way south to Bryce Point. It makes all the stops, however, as it loops back north. There are plenty of restaurants and fuel stations just before entering the park which is very convenient.","June 16, 2014",A Place You Thought Only Existed In Your Dreams,52,"Farmington, Michigan",5

Because Bryce is at about 9,000 feet it is cooler than most places in this part of Utah - a big bonus in the summer when it's hot, but check the weather forecast and dress accordingly. Also bring lots of sunscreen. The ""views"" serviced by the shuttle bus in the summer (from th eVisitor's Center up to Byce Point & Pariah View) are all spectacular and similar. If you are very short of time, don't go all the way out, but if you have the time see the views all the way along the rim and take the Bristlecomb Pine walk at the end of the rim. It is a great chance to walk in the forest which covers the top of Bryce. We also went down the Queen's Garden Trail. The walk is .8 miles long and it is fairly straight down into Queen's Garden & up coming back Take most of your pictures on the way back - you will want to rest anyway. The walk is wide enough to be very safe, and the views from inside the canyon (even if you don't go all the way to the bottom) are very different from those at the top.","June 16, 2014",One of our favorite national parks,195,"suburban Boston, MA",5

We went counter clock wise just because that's how we ended up going, but it didn't seem much different if we went clockwise. Going down the zigzag from sunset is best going down in my opinion and it didn't seem to change the difficulty going this direction.We attended an astronomy talk one evening (not available every night). The talk itself was ok. Wasn't too fond of the lecturer. But pretty good information. The best part was afterwards when they tell you where all the telescopes are setup.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I had to laugh when I read a review on here saying there is no wow factor and it's too cold since this followed their Grand Canyon visit! I guess this is not for everyone. Personally I've been to both and prefer the cooler mornings and evenings. If you leave early enough the cooler weather is perfect for long hikes unlike GC. I camped out for 2 nights and must have hiked over 40 km, and I absolutely loved it! The Fairyland Trail brings you around the hoodoo formations (around 8 mi or 13 km) and the Under the Rim Trail brings you down into the amphitheatre into pine forest. Even the Rim Trail offers some challenging uphill sections up to Bryce Point. Proper hiking footwear is highly recommended as there are sandy and rocky sections with precipitous dropoff that you won't want to lose your footing on. If you love backcountry hiking, this is a must-do. If you are after warm weather and ""wow"" factor give it a miss :) Not true it gets warms in summer too but definitely cooler than GC since you are at 8000-9000 ft.

The hoodoos in the amphitheater are quite amazing, even if only seen from the various points, but best to take at least the Garden loop or better Garden-Navajo loop. The 22 minute film at the visitors center is worthwhile, especially after a 2-3 hour hike in 80 degree whether at 8000 feet elevation.

You won't regret it instead you will thank mother nature for creating such a place for you and me.Fee = $25/car or $10/car with senior citizen,"June 6, 2014",Spectacular View Ever,5,"Long Beach, California",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"The beauty of the sandstone is spectacular and shouldn't be missed. If you don't like nature then stay home, but if you like to see the force of nature and all she can do this is the place to be. Take a horseback ride down to the bottom of the canyon and see the canyon from a different perspective. You need at least four nights to see all aspects of the park.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"There is only one Bryce Canyon and it is not to be missed. Go to the visitor Center first before entering the park so you can see the orientation film on the park. The hoodoos, fins, and other statuesque rock features are made by weathering and erosion. Unlike most of the parks, flowing water only plays a minor role. There is no river here. The altitude of the park is between 8-9,000 ft so there is a lot of snow. As snow and ice melt, water seeps into fractures in the rock. When the water refreezes, it expands and cracks the rocks around it. This is called frost wedging and happens with great frequency in Bryce. The formations in the park change constantly because the forces of weathering and erosion never rest. Oh, the ranger pointed out that Bryce is not a canyon. It is a plateau that has been carved out by the forces of nature. Reminded me of Canyonlands a bit. Also a plateau, but it was carved out by the Colorado River and its subsidiaries. Bryce is far more spectacular though.  You see Bryce from overlooks. You are always looking either down or out. The best way to see everything without a hassle is to drive to the end of the 18 mile scenic drive, turn around and make all the overlook stops on your way back. All the overlooks are on one side only. If you do this, they will all be on your right so you do not have to worry about making left hand turns with on coming traffic. Much easier. And then at the end you are close to the hotel.There are two points,, Sunrise and Sunset, that you should try to see at those times. Bryce is most beautiful then. There are hiking trails and walks, but remember that you are very high up and things that would be easy at 4,000 feet are very hard at 9,000. i was huffing and puffing. It is not fun. Bryce is the highest national park. I was glad we had been to the Grand Canyon first to get acclimated to high altitudes. Bryce is in my mind the most magnificent park of them all. The beauty is astounding. You can easily do the park in a full day, or two half days. We only stayed one night at the Best Western Grand Hotel and did not feel rushed at all. I would give it two days max.","June 4, 2014",MAJESTIC AND AWE INSPIRING,173,"Los Angeles, California",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is the closest I've come to seeing another planet. The warm colored hoodoos stretch so far that I wish that I had invested in a better camera before my trip. A hoodoo looks like a long, thing hourglass, and they are stacked in the hundreds that go many feet high all throughout Bryce Canyon.A lot of people do Zion and Bryce Canyons together. I did, and I wish I had broken them out to separate days. We got a late start at Zion, and that shorted our visit at Bryce. Regardless, when we got off the shuttle at Bryce Point, I was blown away by the views. A lot of people compare Bryce to the Grand Canyon, and by scope, the comparison is valid. They are both vast and go past what you can see (and perhaps fathom). However, the terrain is quite different.We parked in the town of Bryce right outside the park. There was a shuttle parking lot- please note that it is past Ruby's. Ruby's has a sign advertising the shuttle service, but the official park service lot is actually past Ruby's to the left. We spent a few minutes driving around trying to figure out where to park and almost just drove in our vehicle.We took the shuttle into the park and toured the four main viewpoints: Bryce Point, Inspiration Point, Sunset Point, and Sunrise Point. While each one does offer similar views, I really would recommend taking in all four to get a sense of the size of the park. There are several other viewpoints within the park that I wish we had more time to see (the park brochure recommends taking in the main viewpoints via shuttle then driving your own vehicle to view the Southern portions of the park). There is a rim trail that can be hiked from Bryce to Sunrise Point. Most of it was paved, but there are several climbs and descents. My husband is not a big hiker, but we did the portion from Sunset to Sunrise, and we found it peaceful, calm, and romantic.If you are not a big hiker but still want to get down into the Canyon, I would recommend the Queen's Loop. It is the easiest way to get to the floor. However, know your limits. Someone had either passed out or gotten injured and an EMT had to be dispatched to assist while we were there. I was moved by how quickly everyone moved and how they were supportive of everyone as they came up (large cheers greeted every hiker that returned from the canyon floor).If you are coming in from Zion, please note that while it is not that far away, Bryce Canyon is significantly cooler. I had to wear a jacket during Memorial Day Weekend while there. I found the best place to watch the Sunset Inspiration Point, but all of the points were quite stunning. If you see a high off observation area and you can physically make the climb, do so. You will be rewarded.The shuttle's last departure from the Visitor Center is at 7 p.m. If you are planning on viewing the sunset during the summer, it would be best to bring in your own vehicle.","June 4, 2014",You Will Hoodoo,133,"Knoxville, Tennessee",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"My wife and I visited Bryce Canyon in May 2014. We recently joined a photography club and were anticipating some great photo opportunities. We were not disappointed. Every moment in the park is a photo op. The incredible rock formations, the stunning colors, and the plentiful wildlife all make this destination a photographer's dream. Good photographs need a dramatic sky (clouds that explode with color at sunrise or sunset) to make the picture POP, we had beautiful blue skies for most of the stay. Great for everything but getting dramatic shots! Would definitely return in the future.","June 4, 2014",Amazing Bryce Canyon,22,"White Plains, New York",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,We arrived the first day at noon and left our car at the parking lot outside the park where the shuttle bus departs from. We got off the bus at Bryce Point which is the last stop. We took the Rim Trail back to the north which gives you one great view after the other for several hours. The trail goes almost constantly down and is easy to walk and never dangerous. We left the trail at Sunrise Point and took the bus to the visitor center and watched the Bryce Canyon video. We took the bus back to our car and were out at 7 pm.The next day we decided to hike through the valley. We arrived at the parking lot at 9:30 and took the bus to sunrise point. We walked the Queens Garden Trail down to the Peekaboo Loop trail. On our way back we switched to the Navajo Loop trail and climbed up to Sunset Point along the Wallstreet. We were back at our car at 7 pm and we were completely exhausted. Highlights were:1. The Peekaboo Trail where you don't see so many people but the views are absolutely phantastic2. The Wallstreet as part of the Navajo Loop Trail which is very crowded but the steep walls are an absolute must see!,"June 3, 2014",Our recommendation for a one and a half day tour,488,"Frankfurt, Germany",5

There are a number of hikes to take for all levels of ability. I would not take small children on some of the ""easy"" trails as falling could happen easily. I would utilize the shuttle bus system they have, and I would definitely sign up for the special trip to Rainbow Point at the south end of the park. You can easily spend a whole day here if you do any hiking at all.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Of course, I love every one of the Utah National Parks. So, why is this my favourite? For three reasons: 1) the hoo-doos are fascinating in quality and quantity, so varied in colour, shape and size, and they just capture your imagination; 2) you can get up close, weaving in and out of them, giving them your own names based on what they resemble to you, for as long as you want (well, until you lose daylight, anyway!); 3) watching the dawn come up and the burgeoning new light of a new day gradually creep down the hoo-doos standing sentinel along the canyon walls, almost waking them up in the process. The array of hoo-doos is just overwhelming, and they resemble the Chinese Emperor's Terracotta Army in their fixed stare. We drove the whole length of the Park, stopping at (almost) every viewpoint to see the ever-changing landscape and the mesmerising land-formations. Spectacular! The one blot on the landscape is Bryce Canyon City: all the innate charm of a toilet brush, but I guess we all have to sleep and eat somewhere nearby.","May 31, 2014",My Favourite Utah National Park,186,"Meltham, United Kingdom",5

The Bryce point and Inspiration point have awesome views.We also went on the Navajo trail (starts at Sunset point) but didn't go very far. It is considered a ""moderate"" hike, but you can go down into the canyons and then climb back up. You can plan how much you want to go down considering that you will have to climb back up the same distance if you are not doing the whole loop. Its a different view to see the hoodoos at eye level or above on this trail. The hotels in the area get filled up very fast. We booked our hotel in the nearby town of Tropic 4 months in advance and after a couple months even Tropic was full.

So my first piece of advice is plan for the weather no matter the time of the year. You're on top of a mountain and we should have known better than to wear shorts! We decided to take the recommendation of the park employees and use the shuttle. In hindsight, I wish we would have driven ourselves. They really didn't have enough shuttles running and we were always waiting for one to arrive OR completely squashed into a standing-room only bus. Literally, there was one time that I could barely breath there were so many people on that bus (probably exceeding the max capacity, I'd assume). I understand it was a holiday weekend, but perhaps they should have planned better? All of that aside though, the view from Bryce Point made all of the other issues moot points.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"My husband and I just did a week-long trip from Colorado to the Grand Canyon, Zion National Park, and Bryce Canyon. We stayed in each place about 2 days which was perfect (if you have extra time, I'd stay longer in Zion or Grand Canyon -- Zion had the the most variety of hikes!). Of course, the longer you can stay the better, but if you're crunched for time, 2-ish days was just enough time to take in the sights, do some hiking, and relax as well without feeling too rushed. (Side note: I've posted reviews for Grand Canyon & Zion as well). SCHEDULE/OVERVIEW:Bryce is the only place of the three parks that we didn't have any lodging/camping reservations and it turned out to be perfect! Grand Canyon and Zion were much busier than Bryce when were were there the 3rd week of May -- no extra vacancies at either place. BUT BRYCE was different! We left Zion at 7a.m. & arrived at Bryce by 9a.m. (2 hour drive, although we thought it'd be 1 1/2 hrs.). We drove right over to North Campground (since they're doing construction over at Sunset Campground still, but it still looked like a perfectly nice campground to stay at if you can't find space at North) and there were PLENTY of open camping spots at that time; $15/night. Actually a few days later we checked out around 11:30a.m. and there were still a few spaces open that day, but I'd recommend getting there by 9:30a.m. just to be on the safe side. The camping terrain at Bryce is totally different than Grand Canyon & Zion -- many more TREES (although the camp sites are definitely closer together)! We stayed in the D loop and it was perfect -- peaceful, quiet, trees around... Bathrooms right nearby & they were REALLY nice & the stalls were very spacious (especially compared to regular camping standards!). We didn't hike down into the canyon because it was raining and storming most of the time we were there, but we were able to hike along the canyon rim (or you can just hop on & off the shuttle easily if you don't want to hike) during thunderstorms - very easy & enjoyable 2-3 mile hike.The terrain & views are completely different than Grand Canyon & Zion, so it's certainly worth it to visit all 3 places if you have the time. Even if you have just a day or a few hours to go to Bryce to walk along the rim & take pictures, it would be worth it! People all around us just kept repeating ""spectacular!"" and that's definitely a fitting statement. It's just spectacular - rain or shine!OTHER NOTES: Questions? Need help? -- The shuttle drivers are extremely helpful and will direct, help and guide you & answer any questions you have... you won't get lost! Facilities? Food? -- There are shuttle stops with EXCELLENT restroom facilities, a general store with laundry & shower facilities (by this point in our trip I was really excited to find a shower! 8 mins. for $2), gift shops and the lodge has a dining room (breakfast, brunch, and dinner) with a pizzeria next door that's open in the afternoons for a few hours when the dining room is closed - starting at 3:00pm (they have good homemade pizza, lasagna, and other stuff like salads, wings, and yummy muffins!) RECOMMENDATIONS:Bring layers! It rained and was really cold all day one day, hot the next afternoon, and REALLY COLD every night! Wear good shoes! Even if you're only hiking along the canyon rim & hoping on and off the shuttle, the path is NOT paved (unlike the Grand Canyon) so you need to wear hiking or tennis shoes at least -- not flip flops.Hope this helps!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon hadn't been on our radar as a place you must see. How wrong we were and how glad we made the effort to visit. Whilst you can't do a direct comparison with the Grand Canyon, Bryce is stunning and we have now put it ahead of the Grand Canyon on our list of favourite National Parks. The geology of this place is just amazing. Before walking one of the many trails it is worth taking the drive from the park entrance down to Rainbow point, around 18 miles. There are a number of view points along the route with spectacular and ever changing vistas that offer great photo opportunities. Due to limited time, we then returned to Sunrise Point and did the Queen's Garden trail. This is a relatively short trail to walk (about 1.8 miles round trip) but with a drop of some 320+ feet and you have to climb back up! You need to remember you are high up in this park and the high elevation can leave you short of breadth if you are not acclimatised to it. Taking all that into account this is a spectacular walk. The scenery is stunning and the “Hoodoo” formations an forgettable sight. You don't have to be particularly fit the do this walk, but do wear sensible hiking shoes or boots, take into account the altitude and make sure you have plenty of water with you. Full details of all the trails can be obtained from the visitors centreA tip. If you are visiting more than 3 National Parks it is worth getting an annual pass. At the time of our visit (May 2014) this was $80. With normal entry charges being $25 or $20 this soon pays for its self.

Bryce Canyon National Park,By far one of the most spectacular national parks. The overlooks provide vistas of spires (called Hoodoos) that stagger the imagination. The sculpted red rocks mesmerize the onlooker. Watching the changes of shadow and light at sunset was not to be missed. Be sure to take a jacket when you visit Bryce. It can be warm at lower elevations but the highest overlook is 9100 feet and the wind at the peak required sweatshirts and a wind-breaker.Truly an extraordinary experience to see this canyon. We preferred it to Zion and the Grand Canyon. Both of these require a reverent view of the terrain. But at Bryce you feel as one with nature and with ecological time. If Zion is a cake stand - Bryce is the wedding cake.Many parks have restrooms at the various overlooks. The maps given out by the rangers clearly identify which are accessible and which have no facilities.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"If you like beautiful sights, don't miss Bryce Canyon. it is absolutely beautiful. It is worth a trip from anywhere. The hoodoos look like totem poles, but they are naturally carved in the rock. There are probably thousands (if not more) of them. Spend the entire day (pre-sunrise to post-sunset) so you can see the hoodoos in varying light conditions. You do not need to be a hiker as a road runs through the park, and there are plenty of places to park and take a short walk over paved surfaces. In season I would imagine parking could be a challenge. Come in the snow, too.. It is beautiful. Bring your lunch...

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Most people go to the Grand Canyon first because of it's size, but in my opinion Bryce is far more impressive. The sculpted rock formations are absolutely stunning and a big surprise to anyone who has not heard or seen photos of the canyon beforehand. It is relatively easy to walk down into the canyon itself (a bit harder to walk back up again!) and just driving the park road and taking in the views is an incredible experience. An ideal trip is to stay by Bryce, where lodging is easy to find, and take a day trip to the North rim of the Grand Canyon - where lodging is very limited. The landscape between the two is also varied and impressive - especially Red Canyon.","May 21, 2014",Best National Park for stunning views,133,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I'd love to rate this one a 10. The first time I came here was 13 years ago and after all these years seeing it again reaffirmed that it is still just about the prettiest place I have ever been. The last time I was here was in winter and the Navajo Trail at Sunset Point was too slippery for me to navigate, but this time I hiked all the way down and enjoyed it so much, even the hike back up. Such a different perspective to see it from the bottom looking up. Inspiration Point is another beautiful view from the top. It's so picturesque, there's no other place like it. It's a small park and so for those who don't have much time, just to drive in thru Red Canyon and seeing just a couple of the viewpoints still makes it absolutely worth it. Southern Utah and the area around Page AZ should be seen by everyone, there are so many beautiful places to see.A good combo trip would be Zion, Bryce, Page and Grand Canyon. But then there's also Monument Valley, Canyonlands, Arches, & Mesa Verde near Four Corners.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I have visited Bryce Canyon many times over the years and personally it is second on my list of National Parks ( surpassed only by Yellowstone ). What makes Bryce unique are the rock formations that I have yet to see anywhere else. They are called hoodoos and the scenery is spectacular. Visitors can limit themselves to the rim road, this is recommended for the elderly and those who have physical limitations. For those in decent shape, hiking down some of the trails expands the pleasure significantly. You'll need good hiking shoes and don't forget to bring at least a quart of water. Remember that walking down a canyon means hiking back up said canyon. It's steep at times and can be tiring. It is also hotter the lower one goes, particularly in the summer months. Keep in mind that much of Utah is desert country. For travelers seeking a National Park adventure, Bryce has lots to offer. Utah by the way is one of the prettiest states in the country and outdoors people marvel at its wonders. Being a resident of Massachusetts myself, I am not a local tooting a horn for my own backyard.

That worked great since all the look outs and parking was on the right hand side as you come back which made for easy in and out of the lots without crossing over the road. From the first stop to the last we oohed and aahed constantly. Wow! The colors and rock formations did not disappoint! We didn't do any hiking since we had our DOG with us but we highly recommend the trails at Sunset point. We were even treated to a herd of pronghorn crossing the road in front of us.

Then take the drive back to Sunset and Sunrise Points and enjoy the ranger delivered programs that give you a depth of understanding of what is before you.There are few times in life when you can actually say something was breathtaking. This is at the top of the list. The Grand Canyon is majestic and vast...a wonder. Bryce is relatively small yet stunningly beautiful. Take the Rim Walk and see the vast array of limestone structures that have been creating themselves for million of years. Hurry, we are losing it by inches.The NP Service is a great agency doing exactly what T. Roosevelt and others envisioned in the late 19th Century. I dare say, today's Congress would turn all of this into commercial theme parks...they just have no sense of what T.R. saw and understood.As a nation we are far better for having these amazing places and what they offer all Americans.The Visitor Center can be seen in less than an hour. The Lodge is lovely but expensive,,,we stayed in Panguitch 20 miles away and still had a fantastic day without any inconvenience.

It is interesting how your perspective of everything changes in your later years. The first time we we were here we spent a few minutes observing one overlook, but this time we spent hours doing the scenic tour drive, stopping at all the various lookout points. How magnificent this place is. It has to be one of the most beautiful places on earth. I read that this is one of the darkest places in the US and great to view the stars...away from all the lights in Los Angeles. I will say that it was dark and the stars were very bright, but was not as fascinating as I had read....although certainly worth the drive back into the park late in the evening to view. However on the way back to our motel we did see an interesting sight. There were about 12-13 deer grazing along the road, just feet from our car. We stopped and looked at them and they just stood there looking at us. I guess they are accustom to seeing people gawking at them. Couldn't get a picture, but will remember it always. Oh...a fox ran across the road on the next turn. The park has more to offer than I thought. Please don't go through life without seeing all that Bryce has to offer.

A stop at the visitor's center in Cannonville is a good place for a bathroom break, water filling station and information on the 6 mile dirt road to access the parking lot of Willis Creek Slot canyon. The path is sandy and water friendly shoes are recommended but not required. In our group, the parents in hiking boots did not get wet but the kids eventually got their shoes and socks wet and we wished they had put on their keens. Thanks to the dry environment, everything dried in a short time. There are no restrooms or water facilities except at the Cannonville visitor's center which have 24 hr restrooms and water fountains. Enjoy this beautiful hike! We took our time and spent about 90 minutes with the 2 mile roundtrip hike because there are many stunning photo opportunities with the dramatic canyon wall rising 100 ft.

There are hikes of varying degrees of difficulty from easy to strenuous, great drives, you can spend a day or a week. Depends on what you want to do. Wish I had been able to stay longer. Really wish I had stayed at the park lodge. It was beautiful. I've been to many canyons including the Grand Canyon but the landscape here is just so different. It has this dreamlike quality to it. Maybe it's the hoodoos. We were really lucky and got to see some of the landscape still lightly covered in snow.","April 10, 2014",Just amazing,112,"Huntington Woods, Michigan",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,We had a great trip to Bryce Canyon in mid March. It is full of color with all the Hoodoo's and remaining snow. We took a number of hikes across the rim as well as down into the canyon to get a closer look at all the formations. You have to see this place to believe it. Our friends kept telling us to stop and see it and we had a chance this year and did it. We are very grateful that we listen. It was a great experience.We spent two days here since we enjoyed hiking the trails.

We hiked the Navajo Loop combined with the Queen's Garden trail. Wall Street was closed due to ice and falling rock, so we doubled back and onto the Queen's Garden. We also made the drive to the north end to take the short hike to the Mossy Cave. Nice little break from the up and down of the main canyon.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce is one of the most spectacular places I have ever been to . On this trip near the end of March there still were patches of snow , which added even more color to the park . The roads were all in good shape .  We were lazy and didn't hike on any of the trails into the ""canyon"" , settling on seeing every view point . Each stop had something a little different to see . By far our favorite was Bryce Point .  We took our time enjoying the views and including the obligatory souvenir shopping , we were in the park a total of 4 hours . The general store looked like it was closed as we drove by , but there are some eating options just outside the park entrance .  Be aware Rainbow Point's elevation is 9,000 feet . We are a little out of shape and noticed our breathing was a little more difficult when climbing .  A little preview of what will unfold at Bryce is Red Canyon a few miles west of Bryce 's entrance . It also has many pullouts and photo ops that are stunning !","March 29, 2014","It isn't close to any medium sized city , but worth the drive",299,Vancouver,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon NP is a little difficult to get to. Once you are there, there is not a whole lot of infrastructure. There is a Best Western and a few restaurants. But do not let any of that deter you. Bryce Canyon is an extremely unique place to visit. If you aren't too adventurous, stick to the road. You will be able to hit all of the scenic overlooks without a lot of effort. If you do feel like hiking and getting down into the hoodoos, there are a few easy hikes that can do that for you which I highly recommend. There are a lot of hidden scenes below the rim. The high point of Bryce is around 9000 feet, so it is never too terribly hot. However, don't underestimate the relative cool. The elevation and dryness will get to you if you aren't prepare.A good itinerary is to arrive at Bryce in the evening. Take the opportunity to go into the park after dark and enjoy the clear night sky and all of the stars that come with it. Wake up early the next morning and do a few hours of hiking and driving. Drive to Zion that afternoon or go the opposite direction and drive scenic highway 12 to Capital Reef NP.","March 22, 2014",Outstanding views for not a lot of work.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon and have decided if you only had one choice Bryce Canyon is the most entertaining. I believe it is 18 miles long at the turn around. The canyon offers many sites to drive to and stop without any hiking and I can't imagine all the wonders you would come across if you actually hiked the trails. Anyone of any age can enjoy this wonderful creation and by far is one of the most thrilling and exciting places I have been. There were stops that we walked up to where I could not believe my eyes how awesome the scenery was. I have asked many people before we went which park was better and everyone had a different opinion but mine is just this...The scenic highway through the Zion tunnel is out of this world and beyond belief but the rest of the park is for hikers. ( Zion Canyon Scenic Dr, Hurricane, UT) Bryce has wonders that are easy to get to and I would never wanted to miss the scenic highway but I did not see anywhere to stop along the way so for a great visit take the highway and then go on to Bryce for those of you that have only time for a short weekend visit.Buy a yearly pass for 85 dollars which gets you into any National Park and other parks or pay 25 dollars per park. Passes are for sale at the entrance.

If you are an avid hiker, there are options of all difficulty levels for you. And hey, if you like star-gazing, Bryce offers completely undiminished views. They even do nighttime hikes during part of the year and they have star-gazing evenings in the summers as well.Be advised that you are around 9000 feet in the air at the top of Bryce, so be sure to slather on the sunscreen and drink plenty of water.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is about the most beautiful place I've ever been. We arrived on a dreary, cloudy summer day...still, we were awe-struck when we looked over the canyon from the rim. When the skies cleared and the sun came out, the sight was even more beautiful. The sight of the red rock formations (hoodoos) against the blue sky is something I will never, ever forget. The colors of the canyon changed throughout the day, with deeper oranges and yellows as the sun set and then fading at dusk.We went to Bryce Canyon in July, one of the busiest months of the year, but our experience was still wonderful (despite our hatrid of crowds). Don't get me wrong, the park was very crowded, especially at the scenic overlooks (Inspiration Point, Sunset Point, Sunrise Point, etc.), but the crowds thin very quickly as you make your way along any one of the trails. Once you get a half-mile out, you'll find yourself practically alone among the hoodoos. Don't miss the ""Fairyland Loop.""","March 11, 2014",Absolutely Gorgeous,12,"New York City, New York",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce canyon is very unique with Red rock spires rising up from the valley floor like castle turrets in a Fairy tale. You can spend hours just checking out the rock formations and identifying them as different things like creatures and faces. The raw beauty that Mother nature has created here is like no other work of art I have seen. With easy rim walks and most of the beauty captured from the rim looking down into the canyon, it's an easy place to get around and appreciate for all ages and abilities. There is the main area around Bryce Ampitheatre and sunrise/sunset points but there also many other viewpoints further along the canyon drive, which is an easy well paved road to travel. A tip worth noting is to drive to the furthest point on the road first and then visit all the viewpoints on the way back. This will put them all on your side of the road and you won't have to constantly pull across traffic trying to get in and out of the parking areas. If you visit early or late season bring plenty of warm layered clothing, it gets cold quick at such high elevation.This place will take your breath and leave memories for a lifetime, do no miss !","March 7, 2014",Amazing.,254,"West Sussex, United Kingdom",5

We spent 2 1/2 days there and were constantly saying ""OMG, look at that"" only to turn a different direction and see another view that took our breath away. One evening we drove quite a ways up the mountain and parked in one of the parking lots to watch the stars come out. With no light interference it was an outstanding show as literally billions of stars graced the skies.

We went in winter and decided to watch the sunrise which is definitely recommended but maybe in warmer weather. The views are amazing but we didn't enjoy them as much as we could just because we were so cold (it was well below freezing). Seeing it in winter does have its plus's though as you get an amazing contrast between the red rocks and the green trees and the white snow. Unfortunately we arrived the day after a snowstorm and a few of the roads in the park were closed so we couldn't see it all.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce is one of our smaller National Parks, but it's still stunning. The Hoodoos and color are otherworldly, the stuff science fiction novel covers are made of. We've been there often, at least half a dozen times if not more but I'll address our most recent visit last March. Timing was perfect, a recent dusting of snow dressed it up like we'd never seen it before, but was little enough we could still get around. The trails below the rim were pretty slippery, but doable at least where they weren't blocked off. It's prime anytime, but a special wonderland with snow.As I said, Bryce is a small park, you can hit it lightly in less than a day just hitting some of the pullouts and gaze and take pictures from the overlooks. If you have time, longer hikes are more rewarding too, even in summer it's not particularly hot, but you may have a problem catching your breath as much of the park is over 8,000 feet. Even the buildings, the lodge and cabins are special and worth some time if you have it. I'd love to stay in one of the cabins, but with a short season they're very expensive and out of my budget. Maybe sometime.But pay a visit if you can, anywhere from an afternoon to a few days, you won't be disappointed.","February 2, 2014","Small, but stunning",56,California,5

In Bryce Canyon City stop (now or later) at Ruby's hotel, restaurant, gas, visitors center. They have excellent souveneers! Once in the park, the ranger in the Visitor Center was quite helpful. Knowing we had a bit of a time constraint, we followed his suggestion that we limit our time at Bryce to the Bryce Amphitheater area--not driving the whole of the 18-mile-long main park road. We just spent several hours in the park visiting five viewing points, each one providing its own views of the canyons below. Being off season, we were only one of maybe five other visitors the whole time we were there...we were really free to come and go as we pleased. We visited Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration, and Bryce points which encircle the biggest natural amphitheater in the park. Inspiration Point offers magnificent views of ""the silent city"" and the Black Mtns in the northeast. Bryce Point is the starting point for the Under the Rim trail to Rainbow Point and breathtaking views of the Navajo Mtn in the south.Though our amphitheater drive involved a 400' elevation change, we encountered very interesting changes in the tree species: pine to spruce, fir, birch, and aspen.NOTE: there are some trailer and >25' restrictions. Also, winter road closures have to be considered. Suggest going on line for specifics.

You don't really notice much driving in until you start making your way to the amphitheater and then ""WOW!"" I felt like I could have just stood there for hours taking it all in. The crowds were a bit heavy, especially on the main path around the amphitheater but we had no problem getting some amazing pics of the canyon. We hiked the queen's garden/Navajo loop as well as the hat shop trails.Parking wasn't much of an issue as we parked near the visitor's center and then just rode the bus to various stops. We decided to drive to the hat shop trail though since it was a bit further away but still had no trouble finding a parking spot at the trailhead.If you're fairly new to hiking (as we were) bring LOTS of water. Many of the trails here involve hiking down into the canyon and back out with quite a bit of elevation change. The park itself is at a high elevation so you will dehydrate quickly as I found out on the hat shop hike.All said, this park is incredible despite being a bit on the small side compared to the other parks.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"When we first looked in the canyon at the rock formations we thought we were on a different planet. They are very beautiful and depending on how the sun is hitting them can make them look different every few minutes. We camped at the park which was a lot easier than we thought to get a campsite but we did get there earlier in the day. We did a little hiking mostly on the rim of the canyon. One thing to keep in mind is that most of the places you will hike here are above 8000 feet and go up to 9000 feet but you don't feel that high at all. There is one place where you can hike down into the canyon and there is a huge tree at the bottom which doesn't look like it belongs at all, it is a steep hike in and out but it is pretty cool seeing the rock formations from a different angle. The chipmunks here are very friendly so don't be alarmed.

We are experienced hikers and are used to the conditions we experienced on the trail. It is rated as moderate, but we found the trail itself quite easy, but there was an ascent and descent from the canyon that may be challenging for some...

That being said, there's just something about the hoodoos and the sun shining on them that is breath taking. We stayed only one night at the Bryce Canyon Lodge at Sunset Point in a regular hotel room. That was a perfect choice too, because we hiked the rim of an evening and then the Navajo Loop/Queens Garden the next morning. Would definitely recommend everything we did. Our son did the Junior Ranger program and earned a badge in just the 24 hours that we were there. We picked up the brochure before the visitor center closed and returned it the next day before they closed again! We attended the NIGHT SKY program listening and then seeing Saturn through telescopes they had set up late at night. We didn't get much sleep there!Upon arrival it had rained and it was COLD! Make sure you have jackets for evening, but then cool clothes for the heat by day for hiking.We ate in town at a buffet for dinner and then had breakfast in our room (cereal, granola bars, etc) then had pb&j sandwiches on the Navajo Loop hike for lunch the next day.If you are debating on visiting Bryce Canyon National Park...it is a definite yes, you need to!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I have been to Bryce multiple times in multiple seasons. All are spectacular but the experience is quite different. ""In season"" all the paths and overlooks will be open and the shuttle is operating (convenient). You can stay at a lodge in Bryce and it is wonderful to be able to walk out your door and go on a late night hike by moonlight. The downside... large crowds - it isn't ""fun"" trying to get the perfect sunset shot with large groups from tour buses. ""Off season"" is quite different. Gone are the crowds - I have been at major overlook parking sites and been the only car there. Snow on the canyon is beautiful and the mood is peaceful. You can't stay in a lodge within the park but you can get a hotel very close (not walking distance). No shuttle but as there are now crowds thats fine you will get parking. The downside is all the trails are not open and all the overlooks are not open. Hence the amount of things ""to do"" is more limited. Unless you supplement with other items of interest in the area two days is more than sufficient. I would highly recommend an early morning hike - Bristlecone loop at Rainbow point. Every time I have been an early hike resulted in seeing a lot of wildlife (minimum sitings of 5 or more deer). A nice way to start the day.","January 7, 2014",Beautiful in any season,69,"Phoenix, Arizona",5

The organization and the frequency of the bus schedule helped to make it a great experience. The scenery is very different from most other red rock canyons and is very beautiful. One other item that had us concerned was the crowds. We estimate the crowds more than doubled from September 1993 compared to September 2013. We guess more people have discovered the US National Parks as a desirable destination. Seems like more Europeans than Americans made up the crowds. We would recommend later in the fall as a time to go.

Swarms running round like headless chickens was a major issue.Allow them to swarm over then pass. Be patient and you will enjoy it all the more.We took 3/4 hours altogether, but that did not allow for any Hikes. We heard many tell that they were well worth it.

All the roads were plowed and easily driveable but all of the hiking trails had a few feet of snow and thus we were not able to get out and hike the park. Even many of the formal overlooks were icy and had several feet of snow to climb through to get to the views.So while it was amazing and quiet during the winter, just be prepared that with snow on the ground it very much hinders your options at the overlooks and hiking trails.","December 2, 2013","A ""bucket list"" national parks",351,"Fort Worth, TX",5

This is a great time of year to visit with minimal crowds. The visitor center has an interesting video that explains what you'll see in the park.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Ok- visited the last weekend in February and admittedly got very lucky. The weekend before there was a snowstorm and the following weekend the high for the day was 15F (according to the weather report) and a 30 mph wind blowing. The day that I was there it reached the low 50sF with hardly no wind. The hike trails were a mixture of snow/ice/mud- so good durable hiking boots highly recommended but the slush was rather easy to walk on (as compared to a patch of ice that I encountered on the same trip at Arches National Park). Many have said this- but be on site either at sunrise or sunset- and if sunset and right Saturday of the month take in the Astronomy Night while there. Yes- this means a two plus hour after dark drive if not camping in the late winter temperatures- but the sunset view from the Sunset Point is too beautiful to miss and if not there after dark, you are missing one of Bryce Canyon's best features. After dark, the night sky really comes alive. Even on this night- with some high clouds mixed in- one could pick out the winter Milky Way - a view simply amazing. Park rangers on site in the cold for astronomy night went beyond call of duty with information provided and setting up the scopes for the eight to ten of us that were there.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is a beautiful park but is relatively small and can be seen and experienced in one day with a little planning. First, it best to arrive the evening before as the amphitheater faces east and the colors are the most spectacular in the morning and then a distant second in the late afternoon but not too late or the Hoodoos will be in shade. Next, getting something to eat in Bryce is an issue; the location is remote enough with a small enough population that taking care of the crowds is difficult. I would recommend staying at a hotel that offers a hardy breakfast and a microwave in the room, such as the Best Western Plus, and bring a picnic lunch and a microwavable dinner from your previous stop or from Ruby’s General Store in Bryce City. If you are a photographer or want to see Bryce at its most spectacular, start the day by getting up to see sunrise at one of the following three overlooks as they are the best and equally spectacular; Sunset Point (Thor’s Hammer and other large Hoodoos), Inspiration Point (the Silent City, a dense collection of Hoodoos) or Bryce Point (an expansive view of the entire Bryce Amphitheater). After experiencing sunrise, head back to the hotel for breakfast. Once done with breakfast, head to Sunset or Sunrise Point to hike the Navajo/Queens Garden loop trail still in the morning while color is good. This 2.9 mi (4.7 k) loop trail loops through both Sunset and Sunrise Points and down into the amphitheater among the Hoodoos. While it takes some climbing, it should be manageable by most and it is the best hike in the park. After completing the hike, the sun will be getting high in the sky and color on the Hoodoos will be flat and boring so now is a good time to go to the visitor center and see the film and exhibits followed by a leisurely picnic lunch. Mid afternoon is a good time to head to Rainbow Point at the far end of the park, by-passing all of the other overlooks for now. Rainbow Point is the highest point in the park at over 9100 ft (2770 m) so temperatures are cooler and there are plenty of trees for shade. At Rainbow Point hike the 1 mi (1.6 k) Bristlecone Loop trail which is an excellent, flat trail through an alpine forest environment offering views of the Grand Staircase and the chance to see an ancient 1700 year old Bristlecone Pine. When done with the hike it should be later in the afternoon and colors will be starting to improve so it is a good time to work one’s way back, stopping at each of the overlooks, Agua Canyon and Natural Bridge are the most interesting, timing it to arrive very late afternoon or very early evening at Bryce Point for an outstanding view of the entire Bryce Amphitheater. At this point, it is time to go back to your room for a microwave dinner or if you plan to go out, be prepared to wait in a long line at one of the few restaurants in the area. After diner, on a clear night, star gazing is very good and if you are staying a second night, it is worth getting up early again to see sunrise at one of the other earlier recommended points (Sunset, Inspiration, Bryce).","October 22, 2013",How to Experience this Wonder Park in a Day,3757,"Avon, Ohio",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We had a wonderful stay at Bryce Canyon. It was our favorite stop on 2 week trip. I think the hike we did really made it though. Getting down into Bryce amphitheater was amazing. We hiked the Queen's Garden Trail to the Navajo loop, combining them. I can't recommend this enough! It was a little strenuous and I'm not in the best shape but it was very doable. We stayed at the North Campground and took advantage of the showers at the nearby General Store. We were also needing to do laundry and did that there as well. Note that you need $1 coins (and quarters) for the washer and showers. If you have dollar bills, you can exchange them in the laundry room machine for the coins. If you only have quarters on you, you'll need to go into the general store to exchange them. In the campground there are flush toilets and running water. At the campsites there are fire pits and picnic tables. We had stopped in ""Bryce Canyon City"" at Ruby's to buy some supplies...beer, food, ice. The general store at the campground was smaller but had better prices. If you are looking to buy a bottle of booze, it can be purchased at the hotel checkin desk at Rubys but no where else nearby.Went down to the visitor's center one night for the astronomy talk and then enjoyed looking through all the telescopes they had set up out back.

Not too many folk while we where there but I can see it being too busy in peek season. Its one of those places that you must see but seem to forget it as quickly as you go. Zion park or the small Red Rock park in my humble view is a much better must see. Zion park, you almost feel as if your part of it, it wraps itself around you. Brice is a drive by. Red rock is stunning and again in my humble view one should be a in the top three to see.","October 21, 2013",All been said....,32,"Wakefield, United Kingdom",4

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We went to Bryce Canyon after two days at the Grand Canyon. I wondered how it would be different and I sure wasn't disappointed! Bryce Canyon has hoodoos - thousands of them :) We got up early and watched the sun rise over the hoodoos and into the canyon. Then we did two of the moderate hikes - you just have to go down into the canyon - don't just stay up on the rim. Getting down in there and being close to the hoodoos was so much fun! Be sure to pack plenty of water and pay attention to the 'grades' they give the hikes - easy, moderate, strenuous - they are right on the money. The second day, we drove to the far end of the canyon and then drove back, stopping at each and every lookout. Again, I couldn't believe how the views changed each time. We kept saying over and over again, ""This is my favorite view!"" We packed in our lunches both days, which made it easy to just stop and eat along the hikes. The Park Rangers at the Visitor's Center are very helpful in planning your trip!","October 21, 2013",Bryce Canyon was beautiful and interesting!,13,"Topeka, Kansas, United States",5

This site is truly amazing - better than I ever expected. Much better than Grand Canyon (in my humble opinion). We walked around the top rim to experience the site from each higher viewpoint then hiked down to the depth of the canyon where each formation and color was interesting and beautiful - some of these formations reminded me Petra, Jordan.

The hoodoos are out of this world and it is a must see during sunset and sunrise at the vista points on the rim. You can see all sorts of interesting things in the hoodoos, faces and even villages and cities if you let your imagination run wild. The trails are very interesting and the rim walk is a must do whilst in the park.

Perfect weather and timing as Utah had just opened back up it's National Parks. There are no words to describe the feeling you have looking out over the canyon, especially at the highest lookout at Inspiration viewpoint. Awesome, gorgeous, breathtaking...all fall short when you lean up against that chain link with the wind gently blowing in your face and gaze out into the distance. Layered colors of columns swirled in patterns only nature could compose.Bryce Canyon was on my bucket list and I plan to return to hike down among the columns on our next visit.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This hike was scary (at first); thrilling (hiking in the dark); informative (Ranger talks enroute); exciting (descending into the canyon); awe inspiring (upon arriving at the canyon floor, BEAUTIFUL with the full moon illuminating the hoodoos a silver-gray, clear black sky filled with stars); exhausting (ascending back up). Our hike took us to the canyon floor, a place the Ranger called the “badlands,” a 700 ft. elevation change from the rim. You have to wait in line at the Visitor’s Center the morning of the hike to get your free ticket. We got there at 5:30AM, and by the time the doors opened at 8, there easily were more than 60 people to take the 60 tickets they had to give out (two hikes went out that night). We probably could have gotten a ticket if we would have arrived at 6AM, however, during the summer months, the Ranger told us arriving very early is necessary, especially if you have a big group. You need to be wearing, or have with you, the shoes you’ll wear (lug soles required) and everybody in your party has to be there to get their ticket. We’re seniors (in our early 70s) and this hike was awesome; a definite Bucket List addition if you like the outdoors and rigorous activity! We hiked Queens Garden/half Navajo the same afternoon and that helped because we were somewhat familiar with the terrain, even though our Full Moon hike took us on different trails to the canyon floor.","October 13, 2013",Full Moon Ranger-Led Hike is Awesome,96,"Bluffton, South Carolina",5

The views from the view points are breathtaking. I can not even imagine how gorgeous they would be to actually get down into the Hoodoos and the Spires. If you only have 3-5 hours it is still worth going! If you can not hike the paved walkways to look out points are worth the stop. It is $25 a car.

The park is small compared to the Grand Canyon but, in my mind, much more picturesque and peaceful. The entire park can be seen and enjoyed in less than a day so it is a nice visit from local towns. We completed one of the loop hikes of about 2-3 miles in duration. I am experienced backpacker/hunter/traveler who has been in some of the most beautiful places in the world. In my mind, Bryce is right up there with the best of them. The hikes are all doable to anyone in moderate physical condition and some of the smaller ones have handicap access if I am not mistaken. The hike we ventured on took us down into the canyon in the ""Queens Garden"" if I remember right. To be walking amongst the red rocks with vertical spheres sticking a hundred feet above you is spectacular and breathtaking.

We usually went in March for Spring Break with the kids but as we are now empty nesters we went a bit later just before the summer season started. Although there was a bit of traffic, it was a great time to go as the wildflowers were out and we didn't need a coat for most of the time.We stopped at all the pullouts and saw everything. I did notice that the bus that the park has only does a few places, so if you can, I would recommend going off season and driving yourself and stopping at everything and doing some hiking if you enjoy that.The Red Rock Canyon just before going into the park is also worth a stop as you are at the ""bottom"" and so if you can't hike, at least you get an idea of what it would be like.","October 8, 2013",Not To Be Missed,12,"Twin Falls, Idaho",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We had booked a tour with Country Walkers for Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks long before the House of Representatives decided to opt for not funding the federal government. The incredibly knowledgeable guides, Carolyn & Heather started the hikes on September 29th in Bryce Canyon. Their knowledge and obvious interest in the geology and other natural history of the place helped us all to become better informed. The hikes that I went on were moderate to severe. They were well paced and truly enjoyable. On the first day, we hiked the rim were introduced the the hoodoos and the geology that caused them to be made of such fragile (in comparison) sandstone. On September 30th we had an option of a short, 3 mile hike along the ""Wall Street"" formation and a few hoodoos or a 6 mile hike among the hoodoos with a descriptions of the various ecosystems as we traveled through them. I opted for the longer hike. I do not regret it, although the 1.7 mile incline with switchbacks to the starting elevation felt better after I had completed it. During our walk we found out about why Bryce Canyon isn't really a canyon and about the over 200 square mile lake which was at one time located within the area surrounded by the rim. Local plants were identified and we were able to detect a change in ecosystem as individual species changed or new species were introduced. For two nights we were housed in the Bryce Canyon Lodge.On October 1, we left Bryce for Zion National Park, hoping that the House would focus on keeping the government open and find other forums for their discussions. We stopped at Willis Creek on the way and hiked 5 slot canyons. One of the canyons displayed petroglyphs made by the Ancient Pueblans on the walls. If we had not had our guides with us we would never have seen them. Once we saw those, the guides took us to more of them. The archaeologist in each of us was aroused.We were scheduled to go to Zion National Park the next day. But, it was closed. Country Walkers had planned for this eventuality and had booked us rooms at the Best Western Red Hills at Kanab, Utah, a comfortable hotel with all of the amenities. They had even made dinner reservations at the best restaurant in town, before the other tours could book the space. On the morning of October 2nd, the guides surprised us by ushering us through an early breakfast to be among the first people at the Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park. The guides gave us a lecture about the geology of the dunes and just as among the hoodoos at Bryce Canyon, we realized that we were among the only sand dunes in the world created with recycled sand from mountains that were made from recycled sand from lakes that were made from recycled sand from seas. The WOW factor was exponential! we walked with shoes, sandals and finally bare toes. The sands were cool and silky. The sand was extremely fine, but even our most fragile climbers were able to make it to the top. We did not want to leave when we were told that we had a special lunch and walk planned for the afternoon.Because one of our guides is a volunteer, we were able to be introduced to Best Friends Animal Society's Sanctuary in Angel, Utah. It is an incredible non-profit with a mission that pulls at your heart strings because it has been so successful. We had a marvelous lunch at their volunteer cafe overlooking the mountains and overhangs in the area. We toured the facility and then rode to one of the overhangs where we saw petrographs from the ancient Pueblans and then on to an underground lake! (It wasn't Zion National Park, but this was fantastic!!). After that we drove to Springdale, Utah, where we stayed at the very classy Desert Pearl Inn with rooms that opened to an expanse of yard ending at the Virgin River. The highway that cuts through Zion National Park was open so our guides drove slowly so we could see some of the more obvious features like the checkerboard cliffs. Also, we were able to spot Big Horn Sheep on one of the cliffs as we drove by.On October 3rd we were again offered two hiking options. We could hike up to Eagle Crag above Rockville, UT. or we could take a short hike and go to Grafton, the nearest ghost town. Again, I opted to hike the longer distance. We were hiking up our own lunches to be eaten at or near the top of our hike. We were able to see the back side of the West Temple in Zion National Park. One of the crag monuments has been dubbed ""Mrs. Butterworth"" or ""Aunt Jemima"" because it's east facing profile can remind you or either of those iconic characters. There were more and larger trees on this feature than we had encountered on most of the trip.On October 4th we were able to see dinosaur tracks in situ at the museum that has been set up at Dr. Johnsons Farm ( The Dinosaur Discovery Site in St. George, UT). When the tracks were discovered Dr. Sheldon Johnson donated the site. A museum was built over the site, so many of the tracks were never moved. I must say County Walkers saved our vacation and introduced us to wonderful people, great adventure, and a sense of caring and pulling together that we have not had the opportunity to experience often.","October 6, 2013",Country Walkers #1 When Parks Closed,6,"Irvine, California",5

Our experience was capped off by being able to stay in a cabin in the park - which I highly recommend. By the way - you have to pay a park entrance fee at the national parks. If you are visiting several parks, it's worth getting the year-long pass.

But so many people said it's amazing, that we decided to visit it and went with high expectations...only to find a place more wonderful and more magical than one can ever imagine.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is loaded with unique features and fancy colors. On a sunlit day, the rocks, the walls and the hoodoos almost appear to be radiating the light itself in a dazzling display of orange toned colors. You cannot see this masterpiece of nature until you are literally at its edge. Once you reach the edge, you’ll be spellbound at its shear beauty. My brother and I arrived in the mid morning in mid September and started down the trail at Sunrise Point, which was the beginning of the Queens/Navajo Combination Loop, billed as the park’s most popular trail. The trail’s descents did play havoc on our leg muscles while the ascent was slow. During the hike, we experienced Bryce close up, seeing its formations from different perspectives. Despite the rains that fell the night before, there were only a few areas along the trail where we needed to be vigilant for slippery conditions. We emerged from the canyon at Sunset Point, very thankful that we were able to experience the wonders of Bryce along this trail, and with memories that will last a lifetime.After our hike through the canyon, we visited by automobile, the many different viewpoints along the rim. Rainbow Point, Bryce Point, and Inspiration Point were among our favorites. As stated earlier, neither words, nor pictures could describe this place. You need to see this place with your own eyes.","September 25, 2013",Neither Words Nor Pictures Could Describe This Place,117,"Fargo, North Dakota",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I have seen many national parks from the east to the west and the north to the south, and this was was one of the most incredible places i have ever visit. I was in the Okavango Delta in Botswana recently and although vastly different, Bryce even surpass that experience.I did a seven hour hike starting around the rim first and then made my way into the bowl of the canyon. I stopped and took great photos and eat my packed lunch surrounded by beauty. One can do it at one's own pace and follow several different trails. Good hiking boots and a sun hat is essential. I went 9/21 and the weather was perfect. Some snacks and water is a good idea.Make sure to go to Zion, about 2 and a half hours from Bryce, different enough to warrant the drive. I suggest two days at Bryce and one day at Zion, if you are a hiker maybe two days at each place, but i did one day at each place and i cover most of it.","September 25, 2013","Awesome Bryce national park, Utah",3,"Charleston, South Carolina",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Up at 7 am and out of the 4 hinge Marriott by 8 am. We initially notice that HW 70 out of Richfield was rather blah (no red rocks) and more like a greener Vegas or out east so-so landscape mountain area, so we went down south via HW 89 towards Bryce Canyon. We found this path more interesting with canyons followed by fertile valleys followed by canyons and so on. The valleys are filled with cowboy environments associated with raising cattle and everyone had horses. The river that runs through this area looks like it could be a challenge in the canyon area during a flash flood environment, but a check with the weather man would be in order if you plan this route. We most likely would take it anyway even with rain because we like the risk and because we enjoyed what we saw on this trip. One STRANGE thing we noticed is that although we APPEARD to be going down hill the water in the Sevier River appeared to be going uphill (yea an optical illusion). We later learned from our guide at Bryce that the Sevier River is one of the few rivers in the US that flows south to North; and due to all the farm irrigation along the way the river slowly looses all of its volume (does not dump into any other river).The weather was almost perfect with clear skies and 63 F temps as we entered Bryce. We tuned into the recommended AM radio information radio as advertised at the road side placard and discovered that although you can take your car into the entire park there are times during the year where finding a parking space at view sights is very difficult and they were recommending taking the Parks free bus. This free bus starts outside the park, but picks up passengers all along 5 mile round trip into Bryce’s lower five major points and back (every 20 minutes =hop on hop off). The radio announcement also identified that twice a day 9 am and 1 pm the park service has a special bus that takes those that sign up on a free educational trip deeper into the parks dead end road all the way to Yovimpa point (beyond the normal bus path towards an additional 19 miles).We took the standard bus to Bryce Point and walked the 2 miles along the canyon rim to the lodge where we had a nice lunch. Along our walk along Inspiration Point Tom did name one of the Hoodoos Yvonne. At the lodge we picked up the 19 Mile bus trip to Yovimpa Point. The advantage of this extended trip is that the trip was free and the bus was not the standard city bus format that services the lower section, but rather a full size tour bus vehicle, additionally our bus driver narrated all sorts of history and facts about the park along the 3.5 hour very educational trip.Bryce is very impressive and is coming up higher on our canyon rating, but the bulk of what there is to see (although very exceptional) is in a relatively small area as compared to other locations we have visited so far. Per our guide; Bryce is “wearing away” the fastest of all the canyon areas. The reason why the rock (well actually sand and compressed dirt) are so different is because the “rocks” / spires / hoodoos are effected differently then other canyon areas with the weather at Bryce experiencing at least 200 freezes / thaws a winter verses only two or three at other parks. All this contraction and expansion is ripping apart the soft sandstone very fast as compared to others park areas, with it now estimated that Bryce will no longer exist in 2 million years --- Yea We Know = Live it now and do not think about the past or future!It only rained about 5 minutes on our first extended bus trip stop and cleared up quickly after that one. The guide’s narration really made this trip to Bryce very interesting. FYI = Lodging at the lodge this time of the year runs around $210 per night in the hotel facility and $235 a night in the cabins.","September 24, 2013",Bryce,362,"Two Rivers, Wisconsin",4

Bryce Canyon National Park,"It took our breath away! We did not know what to expect as we did not research this destination (which is something we normally do), but in the end it was one of the very best trip we ever took. We also took the scenic drive to get there (From Cedar City, Hwy 14 to Duck Creek, then north on Mammoth Creek Rd to Panguitch) which is a route we highly recommend. It also takes you through Red Canyon which is worth a trip all by itself. Getting into Bryce was easy, and once inside was not congested and we found parking at every stop. And while the Park is essentially a huge canyon, the drive is along the rim at an elevation of more than 9,000 feet in places. Bring extra batteries for your camera, as you will find lots of lots of photo opportunities. And bring a jacket, even in the summer, as the high elevation also means cooler temps. I would also recommend watching the movie in the Visitor Center as it helps explain the history and how the stone formations were created. - - As far as lodging, there are LOTS of (locally owned) motels and lodges along the way, but we did not see them on the sites we normally use for reservations and so we spent the night in Cedar City. That is too far away, and the next time I would put in a little more effort to make a reservation closer to the park. - If over age 62 or disabled get pass to enter park for free.","September 22, 2013","A ""Must"" for all Ages!",57,Sacramento,5

Unless you want to see a 22 minute movie or buy a tee shirt, you can skip the Visitors Center, and guide yourself.Unless you're into hiking, everything you'll want to see is along a single dead-end road that runs about twenty miles. The most spectacular views are the first two, Sunrise and Sunset Points, and they come up within the first two or three miles.These stops may be crowded, so parking could be a problem. In fact, the park service runs shuttle buses to them to help relieve the congestion. All the rest of the park, though, should be relatively easy to see by car. The turns are clearly marked on the map, and the road is in good shape. If you're early, go to Sunrise and Sunset first; otherwise, you might do well to drive all the way to the end of the park, Rainbow Point, and work your way back, stopping at as many of the sites as you feel like. All the views are spectacular, but they're best seen before or after high noon, since the shadows cast by the rock formations contribute to their dramatic effect.You can do as much walking as you feel like, but you can see most of the Canyon just by pulling off the road or taking short walks.","September 7, 2013",Tips for Seeing Bryce Canyon on Your Own,196,"Tucson, Arizona",5

Also, the map isn't very good and some of the paths aren't clearly labeled, and aren't labeled often enough - my husband and I were not quite sure what path we were on for a decent amount of time, and I know we weren't the only ones because I saw others also asking for directions.It was still a great visit and not too crowded.

Those trails are the climax of the park and are must sees. I would not recommend it for families with children under 8 years old. They should be mature enough to not play around as if you joke around you can fall off the cliff. You should be fine if cautious. They have overlooks for the hoodoos which are breathtaking and beautiful. I suggest this place.

The park provides two shuttle services so you don't need to drive those narrow, winding roads yourself and can really enjoy the scenery. We took both tours--the one to Bryce Point and the Rainbow Point tour (which is 4 hours). Both were well worth the time--the views are stunning.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I visited this amazing national park for the second time in July this year. It was so great to be back again! I love to photograph so this is one of the most impressive places I have ever visited. My wife and I stayed here for two days so we got both the sunrise – and sunset view. I think that the sunrise is the most impressive form the sunrise point (see some of my attached photos and you will understand why!)My wife and I took the combination of the Navajo Loop with the Queens Garden Trail looping from Sunset to Sunrise points. What a breath taking trail! If you can spend 2-3 hours for a hike here I will highly recommend this trail. Start early in the morning (7-8 AM) when there is not too busy and the temperature (at summer time) is OK.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Incredible - stunning views. The park was very quiet at opening, but was busy by noon. You can drive in and park at the various scenic points, but there is not that much parking. If you are traveling solo, park at the shuttle parking just outside of the park and use the regular shuttles. Instead of $25 to take my car in, I only paid $12! Couples or families might also want to consider taking the shuttle – parking within the park looked to be a bit tight by noon.I recommend doing Navajo and Queens loop in reverse to what the park map says (down Navajo then up Queens Garden – the ascent on the Queen’s Garden trail is a bit easier). I also recommend walking the Rim Trail from Inspiration Point to Sunset point. The views are spectacular and the walk is on a well-groomed trail.

When you get to edge of the mountain and look down, you are greeted with the most spectacular views. We hiked down from Sunset Point along the Navajo Trail and came back up using the Queens Garden Trail. I had read about the hoodoos, and seen pictures online, but none of this prepares you for actually seeing them in person. We stayed in Springdale (outside of Zion) and did Bryce as a day trip from there, because there was a better selection of hotels in Springdale. We stayed at the Desert Pearl in Springdale, and just loved it! One day in Bryce is enough, and the drive from Zion to Bryce isn't too long.

Stop off at the park entrance to plan your day through a friendly ranger. We did a number of parks over the western side of the States and this was our favourite. If you are visiting multiple parks throughout a 12 month period, you are best to buy an annual pass for about $80 which allows a vehicle access to most parks in the States. 5 of us did 4 parks (in 3 weeks) and like I said it only cost us $80 total......

We enjoyed every thing about the park. We saw two types of deer, ground hogs, prairie dogs, ravens and chipmunks. We went to every overlook except Fairyland and walked the Bristlecone Loop Trail, the Navajo/Queens Trail and took the horseback ride through Peek a Boo trail.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is amazing and fascinating and composed of the most weird and intriguing rock structures we've ever seen. Mother nature had paint brushes flying when she designed this canyon with its wildly beautiful reds, rusts, golds and oranges on natural bridges & all kinds of strange rock formations called Hoodoos. These tall, thin spires of rock protruding from the bottom of the canyon are also called tent rocks, fairy chimneys & earth pyramids. There's wonderful hiking everywhere and amazing photo ops from down below and above. Signs remind you to watch your kids (and pets) as the cliffs are sharp & steep. This canyon is so unique, it's a must see for all including the kiddos. It does require a park pass and seniors get a lifetime all park pass for $10. You can pay by the car/person/day or annual all park pass (recommended).","August 25, 2013","Fairy Chimneys or Hoodoos, take your pick.",124,Phoenix Arizona,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We chose to walk the Queen's Garden and Navajo Loop trail which is billed as the world's best 3 mile hike as we were not disappointed.Great variation in gradient to make the hike interesting and the scenery is ever changing and is simply stunning. We are both moderately fit but the upward hike is very tiring! Take lots of water and take note of the weather conditions as it can change vety suddenly. Whilst setting out in hot, sunny conditions, we had only just completed the hike an hour later when we had hail, heavy rain, thunder and lightning. Would have hated to be at the bottom of the canyon in those conditions!!Very easy to get around the park as the free shuttles run every 12-15 minutes.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Astonishing landscape. The first thing we did was the trail called navajo loop. We would recommend doing the trail in the following order. Start in sunrise point and walk clockwise. Ensure that you do not see the sunset point until the end of the trail. The trail is done in a couple of hours. Fantastic. Do not forget good shoes, suncream and a hat to protect you from the sun. After the trai, do not miss the bryce point. We went all the way up to the end of the park to see the various points in the scenic road, but if you are in a rush to go to the zion canyon, they are less worth viewing and the road is a dead end so you will have to return 25miles back in the same road.","August 20, 2013",Astonishing landscape.

Hike into a trail, even if you only have a couple hours to visit the park... Take Queen's Garden trail in to get an upclose look at the hoodoos, rock formations and dramatic scenery.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Unlike Zion or Yosemite Valley you will have to do some hiking to really experience the breathtaking beauty of Bryce Canyon. There is only one entrance that welcomes you to a main road that meanders along the rim of the canyon. There are plenty of view points along the rim that provide some wonderful views but you will want to hike down into the canyon. We started at Sunrise point where the grandeur of the red rock spirals and what are called hoodoos changes with every turn and drop of elevation. It is absolutely spectacular. The hike was 2.9 miles down and back up to Sunset point to the south. We did it in 2.5 hours. Best to hike early morning as the eastern son lights up the red cliffs. Sunset photos can also be dramatic between 4 & 5 as it hits the top spires of the canyon. It is a must to take plenty of water and don't forget your camera.

Make sure you stop by the Visitor's Center after you enter the park. You can get a Junior Ranger's booklet and on the back page it explains how anyone of any age can earn an ""I Hiked the Hoodoos!"" button. Sure you can BUY the certificate but you have to EARN the badge. Why not do it?!? You're going to be hiking in order to fully experience Bryce, so why not get bragging rights via a badge?The booklet (and Park newspaper/map) categorizes the hikes as easy, moderate, and strenuous. It gives the distance and estimated time t complete. This helps you plan out our day.Bring and drink lots of water and refill at the Visitor's Center. Bring snacks, too. Take lots of pictures!

The main canyon which is also serviced by frequent free shuttles and the secondary canyons which are accessible by private vehicle plus one shuttle in the morning and one in the afternoon to the furthest point (Rainbow point) only. The canyons (all of them) are simply a must see. One runs out of superlatives to describe the magnitude that awaits your eyes (and cameras). There are several hiking trails graded as ""easy, moderate or strenuous"" Allow yourself at least 3-4 hours if you have your own vehicle and wish to see all the viewpoints. If you have limited time, do the main canyon first. Higher Inspiration Point gives a good overview of the main canyon but it does involve a bit of climbing.

The park is a very long drive from Salt Lake City. By the time we made it to the park from Salt Lake City, it was after noon. That would be fine, except, the only affordable lodging we could find was an hour and a half past the park in Kanab, Utah. That meant we were only able to spend four hours at the park. Four hours in more than enough time to view the park from the top of the canyon and enjoy lunch in the lodge, but only allowed enough time for one very short hike into the canyon. To do this national park justice, you need to find a place to stay closer than Salt Lake City and Kanab.Having been to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, I would rate Bryce Canyon much better.","August 16, 2013",8th Natural Wonder of the World,53,"Portland, Oregon",5

The trail switched back and forth along a narrow gravelly path with a serious drop off the side. This is a national park and there are no railings, even most places along the top rim.

The hoodos and bridges were spectacular. You don't need as long @ Bryce as you do at Grand Canyon , it is more condensed than GC. We are still out which is the best and I think the vote was 50/50.

The main part has the most amazing rock formations - to see it in person is just awesome.The highlight was a ranger-guided moonlight hike down into the canyon. Our ranger , Geoff, was not only knowledgeable and an interesting character in his non-ranger life, but he was so friendly and able to keep the entire group moving along and engaged. This is only offered 1 or two evenings a month, is limited in size, and you must sign up early (like 6 AM). Best dining is in the Lodge restaurant.

If you listen to people talk, up on top, English is the predominate language. But hike down into the canyon and it seems like there are more foreign languages being spoken than English. American's are too fat and lazy to hike down and back up. But don't miss it. Take a hike down to the bottom of the canyon.","August 7, 2013",Unique in All the World,32,Springville,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We drove straight from the Grand Canyon to Bryce Canyon, and it was amazing to see the difference in scenery and terrain around every corner. Then when we got to Bryce we couldn't believe how different it was! We went to Sunset Point for sunset and it was beautiful...it is deceiving because the sun sets behind you, but you get all of the beautiful colors of the sunset in the clouds and reflecting off the canyon. Don't forget to peek behind you through the trees to catch a glimpse of the sunset. We also watched the sunrise from Sunrise Point. But we got up WAY to early and sat in the freezing cold (53 degrees is freezing for a Floridian like me). My recommendation would be to go right after the sun rises....the morning sun on the canyon is beautiful. After you go to Sunrise point you should hike down into the canyon from Sunset Point through the Navajo Loop. It's steep, so take your time going up and take lots of breaks (and water). It doesn't take that long, but it's cool to be able to walk down into the canyon. After coming from the Grand Canyon where exploring is limited on your own, we really enjoyed this a lot. Go first thing in the morning to avoid the crowds. It's more peaceful and your photos won't have a ton of tourists in them. A note about accommodations: We stayed at the Bryce Canyon Resort Hotel, they are really nice there but wish we stayed somewhere else. The rooms needed repairs and were musty, and the shower went from burning hot to freezing cold to burning hot again. I screamed three times taking a shower! It was not enjoyable. BUT, you should definitely eat breakfast at the Bryce Canyon Resort Restaurant. They have the BEST breakfast I think I've ever had! Get the steak and eggs and enjoy all the cowboy and outlaw memorabilia on the walls and the Johnny Cash playing.","August 6, 2013",Beautiful and Fun To Explore,18,"Orlando, Florida",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is one of the most spectacular places on Earth. The red, orange, yellow, tan, every other color rock formations called hoodoos were believed to be a people tricked by Coyote into becoming rock by the indigenous People of the area. It surely feels that way. The trails wind down and through these rock sculptures carved out by wind and water over millions of years. Every turn reveals a different perspective of this unique landscape. It's hard not to be smiling the whole time. The rim is almost at 8000 ft so it is cool or cold once the sun sets. It rains in the afternoon with some serious t-storms. The campsites are a bit small and w/ 2 tents sometimes it was hard to find 2 good flat, even tent sites. I would go back in a heartbeat but I'd bring a camper.","August 4, 2013",The Lost Tribe of Hoodoos,38,"Playa Samara, Costa Rica",5

The views are stunning, there are not adequate words to describe the beauty there.We were in the area less than 24 hours, my next trip will include a hike and horseback ride into the hoodoos, which are the official name of the rock formations. There is a nice ranger station and film that shows the history and geology of the area.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"There are many National Parks in the U.S. West where when you enter them you feel as if you've entered another world. Such is the case with Bryce Canyon where you gaze down from an altitude of 8,000 feet onto a panorama of red and white rock formations known as Hoodoos for their singular and sharp shapes rising upward from the ground.We visited Bryce as part of a 13-night escorted Globus bus tour from Rapid City to Las Vegas. Our final stop, Grand Canyon, was still a couple of days in the future but the anticipation had been growing throughout our nearly two-day drive through Utah from Jackson and the Tetons.But our first gaze upon the incredible scenery unfolding before us as we approached one of the amphitheaters below stole the moment. There's an oppotunity to climb to Inspiration Point and hike along the rim, where at some points there are not fences to prevent a very long fall if you lose your step at the wrong time. Each vista, while producing similar scenery, provides a unique point of view -- one that is very difficult to walk away from.It is safe to say that our visit to Bryce Canyon -- brief as it was -- far exceeded our expectations.","August 3, 2013",Nearly Rivals the Grand Canyon for Physical Spectacle,32,"Millsboro, Delaware",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is phenomenal. The vibrant colors, the majestic rock formations, the huge trees, the fresh mountain air all come together to create an amazing place. We only scheduled one night for ourselves at this park and while we've wished we had more time most places along our road trip, this one was our biggest regret. We explored on foot and by car from the moment we arrived to sundown and then back up at sunrise to hike down into the Canyon. Even so, we have not even scratched the surface of everything we'd like to do and see at this park.We were surprised there weren't more people driving slowly through the park at dusk because we saw so many animals in and near the road. Most people seem to cluster near the park's main entrance to see the antelope herd there, but there is so much more to see as you head further south into the park.Heavy clouds and light rain hid the full moon so we were not able to enjoy the canyon via moonlight, but we know for certain we will make a big effort to come back to this park so hopefully we’ll enjoy the night skies Bryce is famous for someday!","August 2, 2013",Nothing short of phenomenal,288,"Ann Arbor, MI",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Having been to a few national parks now, we as a family agreed we loved Bryce. We spent only the day but did everything. We entered the park with the car ($25) valid for 7 days. We went straight away in the morning to do a hike from Sunset Point. We left the car and walked clockwise, Queens garden, Navajo loop and the rim. We are experienced walkers so it took just over 2 hours round trip. This walk takes you right down into the canyon and so one must remember if you go down you have to walk back up. It might be tough going for young kids or the elderly or people with any heart convictions. Otherwise a must as this canyon is fantastic and you see lots of wildlife on the way. We then had a picnic at Sunset Point. There is a small general store to purchase snacks pizza or soup should you desire. We then drove to all the other viewing points starting with Rainbow & Yovimpa Points . Each one special with something amazing. My personal favorite viewing point was The Natural Bridge. The light was stunning (late afternoon) and we got some fantastic photos.. There is a shuttle bus but it doesn't go to all the viewing points so check before you leave the car parked for the day.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Everyone must see this an the Gran Canyon and be able to make distinctions between the two. The temperature in the summer was unusually pleasant at only in the high 70s F during the day and cool at night. This made the distinction from the rest of the national parks in the Colorado Plateau. We also saw more wildlife than in any of those other parks as well. ,"August 1, 2013",Spectacular.,159,"Holbrook, New York",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,First time at Bryce after visiting Cedar Breaks the day before. We parked at the general store area which made for easy access to the Queens Garden/Navajo Loop. This 2.9 mi loop was perfect for us and our boys (12 and 9). The weather was great at9:45 when we started the trail in the clockwise fashion. I highly recommend you do the trail this way as the beginning is in the sun just for a short time but has many areas of shade to stop if needed. At the end when you climb back out of the canyon you are in the shade when it is hotter. It never got above 80 while we were there and the base of the canyon was just beautiful. This is the most popular trail here so leaving early is vital. It thins out the farther you go.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"A not to be missed park! I planned a trip out to Zion and in my research, many others had suggested Bryce. So glad I took their advice!! Bryce is so unique and gorgeous. Hiked the rim, rode a mule into the canyon, drove up to the all the look out points. Even the drive from Zion to Bryce is a 5 star drive. I cannot emphasize enough that if you are even reading this then YOU NEED TO GO TO BRYCE!! I stayed in the cabins in the park at the lodge and it was perfect, adorable, best location. In the middle of the night, we woke up, grabbed flashlights, walked 2 min to the rim (careful not to walk over the rim!), and all to ourselves star gazed. Milky Way and shooting stars. More stars than I have ever seen. It is a magical place. The two highlights were star gazing and the mule ride. Mule ride was worth every penny. I was more than happy to let the mule to all the work while I awed at the hoodoos up close. My only regret is I didn't have more time their - only 3 days.","July 30, 2013",Amazing,40,"Hollywood, Florida",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"The Bryce Canyon National Park is well worth a visit – but if you are short of time when travelling in Southwest USA you may want to consider limiting your visit to just one day. The park area is huge, but all of the major sights are found in and around the canyon amphitheatre near the Visitors Center and the Bryce Canyon Lodge.Hiking the Navajo Loop combined with the Queens Garden Trail is very rewarding and takes around half a day. Many other hiking trails are available and nice view points are numerous along the road to the end of the park at Rainbow Point – but really, when you have done the Navajo and Queens Garden trails you have seen all the highlights and may want to move on to other great sights in Southern Utah or Northern Arizona.Bryce Canyon is definitely a must see but unlike most other national parks you can do it in just one day","July 30, 2013",Sparkling pink hoodoos,175,"Aarhus, Denmark",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"My family and I just returned from our trip to UT. Bryce Canyon was our first stop on our week long hiking trip. We went to Bryce three times during the week, because we could not get enough of the breathtaking views of the Bryce Canyon Amphitheater and the many hoodoos. We hiked the Queens Garden/Navajo (dubbed the best 3 mile hike in the world... I can not agree more) and the Tower Bridge/Fairyland/Rim Trails (~8 miles). Our 7 and 8 year old nieces were real troopers and completed the trails with a smile. They both earned their ""I hiked the hoodoos"" pins and junior ranger badges (the first of three badges). They were (and so was everyone) so proud of their accomplishment! We also drove to all of the viewpoints, including Yovimpa and Rainbow Points.

Once a traveler has been to Bryce, he or she will always recognize photos of the canyon and say, ""I've been there!"" The orange spires of the hoodoos in the hundreds, possible thousands, is a sight to keep for a lifetime. It is a park that works like a picturesque drive through. The best way to enjoy the park is to drive to the top and slowly drive down stopping to view each landscape. There is an opportunity to hike down into the canyon but it requires good shoes for the steep descent and climb. When we visited in May of 2012, crowds were not a problem and the weather was in the upper eighties.

Search for ""Bryce Canyon Images"", and you will know what you are in for. We drove the road on the afternoon we arrived, and saw prairie dogs and antelope, very cool.The next day we hiked 5 miles on the Navajo and Peek-A-Boo loop trails.

Bryce Canyon National Park,My wife and I visited Zion and Bryce on the same trip and loved both. Most people do both or consider doing both so here's a nugget as you decide where you go or prioritize your time Bryce is great if you want great views without having to walk a whole lot. Over a leisurely 2.5 mile stroll you can see some of the most amazing geologic formations and vistas. In contrast with Zion you have a fair bit of hiking to see the best parts (something like 8- 10 mile round trips) and much of the more accessible attractions are dried out (at least in early July when we went). To sum up - Zion for the athletes and Bryce for the casual hikers.More on BryceThe only thing you want to be cautious about is lightning and for that reason you might have your plans disrupted as you wait out thunderstorms. Its one of the most dangerous places to be out during a thunderstorm and there have been fatalities in the recent past. Early and late in the day are supposed to be best for avoiding bad weather.The hoodos and panoramas are breathtaking. We spent half a day taking in the views at the vista points including and north of Bryce point. Bryce Point was probably the best but they were all good. We also did a gentle hike starting at Sunrise point to view the Hoodos up close.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"There is nothing else like Bryce Canyon on this planet - it is like getting a glimpse into another world. You can get a good taste of it from driving the rim road and getting out at the view points. But don't miss hiking down into the canyons among the hoodoos to really feel at one with this landscape. The Queens Garden/Navajo Loop trail is not to be missed, but be prepared for strenuous hiking coming back up. The hike back up through Wall Street is worth the effort though and really provides perspective on the enormity of these spectacular formations. My favorite spot was just outside the park at Fairyland point, where you'll find few people but some of the best views. Standing at Fairyland point, a few yards down the trail in the canyon at sunset, soaking in the views of the orange and white landscape with not another soul in sight and only the sound of a bird in the distance was positively enchanting.The only negative to this park is the city outside it and the limited dining and lodging options. To return here, I'd make a day trip out of it to avoid the terrible amenities.

Its a small park, but beautiful. All of the main sites are very accessible. We were able to drive to all of the main view points. We also hiked the Bristlecone Loop which was an easy hike, though its at a high elevation - I believe its close to 9,000 feet at this point - so I found it a little hard to breathe comfortably. But anyone in average shape can easily hike this trail - just be aware that the elevation might be difficult if you aren't used to high elevations. It was something that surprised me because I hadn't given it any thought before starting the hike.The views are phenomenal so it is well worth it to get out of your car and walk around as much as you can. I'd like to go back at some point and hike some of the other trails.Its definitely a must see National Park if you are in Southern Utah.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"In the last week, my son and I have visited the Painted Desert/Petrified Forest, the Grand Canyon, and Zion. Our next stop was the nearby Bryce Canyon. Maybe I have too many other grandiose things to compare it to, but this ended up being something of a disappointment. The drive up from Springdale on 89 was pretty and once you turn off the highway, you go through a place called Red Canyon and the Dixie Nat'l Forest and they are quite pretty too. At the Dixie Visitor Center you can get your Nat'l Parks Passport stamped. Then we got to Bryce. First caveat: On the nps website for Bryce, it says a shuttle runs during the peak summer months. At Zion this meant everyone park and ride the mandatory shuttle to the various points and it runs like clockwork there. At Bryce, it is NOT MANDATORY to take the shuttles. This means finding parking at the various stops however, and as most of the trails are not loops it still makes better sense to ride the shuttle, since if you're doing the rim walk you're going to end up somewhere away from where you started. However, these are not nice buses like at Zion. They're old, run down and stink like a mass transit bus does. The ride in, we nearly had a bus ride to ourself, but on the way out, due to the storm, it was SRO, and we rode the two or three stops back to the Visitors Center standing and swaying into all our neighbors.We walked the rim from Inspiration Point to Sunset point and from the Lodge back again to Sunset for the Ranger led program my son needed to attend for his Junior Ranger badge. A storm moved in after that and we were ready to go anyway. If I were to go again, which I don't see happening, I'd take my own car and park at the various points to see the view and then move on. Second caveat: The trails we walked were unpaved, loose rock and there is nothing at most points along the trail to keep you from falling over the edge and becoming one with the hoodoos. Watch where and how you walk! I never felt unsafe, but I worried about several small children I saw near edges, and a woman in a wheelchair parked by her husband precariously close to the edge for a picture. The only bonus of walking th rim was seeing how the hoodoos changed as you walked. Most scenery is static, you look at a distant mountain and its still the same face you see as you pass it by, but here, because the hoodoos are so close and eroded uniquely on each side, as you pass the view changes. It's a very 3D view which is probably the only redeeming feature.Not as much wildlife in the part of the park we were in. Saw a lot of fat chipmunks (don't feed them!) and some different birds, but no lizards or big wildlife. We had lunch at the lodge while we waited for the ranger program. It was pricey, but incredibly good. I'd recommend it. The only downside there is they don't have a great view of the cliffs like Grand Canyon lodge does, but this is one of the only original Nat'l Park lodges and is very charming.My son (11) still enjoyed our visit and if you're doing the Grand Circle or are visiting in the area, it's worth seeing, but don't expect to be as wowed as with some of the other parks in the area.","July 18, 2013",Not that impressive,14,"Perry, Iowa",3
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We spent a day in this park during our week trip to Utah. We felt that was all that was needed, but you could spend as much time there as you wanted hiking and doing ranger programs. They have a free shuttle from the visitors center. We chose to drive because there were 6 in our party. The driving was fine and the parking lots weren't conjested. Before we did the driving tour of the park, we did the Peek-a-boo Loop trail. It was nice to have a more up close and personal tour of the park and we started very early in the morning so we had the trail to ourselves. We expected to beat the crowds AND the heat, but by 9:30 am on a July day, I was roasting. (I'm also not used to warm temperatures).Definately stop at this park as you do your tour of the many national parks in Utah.","July 18, 2013",Beautiful rock formations,131,"Billings, Montana",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We are full time RVer's and this is the furthest west we have ever been. Our friends who had already been to this area rave about Bryce. We got there early to avoid crowds and the after noon heat. We left our car at the visitor center parking lot and took a free shuttle bus to Inspiration Point. The hike was mostly level around the rim of the amphitheater. Words and the hundred's of pictures we took to not do this national park justice. Every turn brought us a new view that was breath taking. Our second day we took Queens Garden Trail to canyon floor. Again we were surrounded by beauty. Everything we saw from the rim we were now seeing from a bottom up view. Again spectacular. We took the Navaho Loop out of the canyon. We took a free bus tour of the canyon, our driver and tour guide, Spike was very knowledgable about all the animals, flora and geology of the canyon. this was really a great tour, I wish we had done taken it the first morning we were there. This was not as crowded as I expected. It was a good idea to get an early start. I was glad we had proper hiking wear, my 3 liter container in my back pack, and my hiking sticks. Proper foot wear and plenty of water are a must. I am glad we saw Zion first then Bryce. Zion is beautiful, but Bryce is so much more and I felt a sense spirituality through out the park. This is a must stop for everyone.","July 16, 2013",Bryce Canyon,135,"Reading, Pennsylvania",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"I went to the Grand Canyon, Zion Canyon, Red Canyon and the Bryce Canyon in a single trip for five days one year ago. At the end, I have to tell you that the Bryce Canyon its the most beautiful of them, because of the shapes and the red color of the rocks. It was snowing at the time and the contrast between the red rocks and the white snow was something special. Totally recommend.","July 16, 2013",My favorite!,150,Luxembourg,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon can be as strenuous or relaxing as you want. We didn't do any hiking as we spent the previous day in Zion and were still recovering from that. But, you can basically see nearly all of the canyons and rock formations from the drive around the park and the lookout points. The elevation is high, so the temperatures are a bit more moderated from say Zion or points lower down. So many beautiful vistas you'll want to fill your whole camera memory card!","July 16, 2013",Spectacular - Don't Pass it Up!,47,"Calgary, Canada",4
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon offers some wonderful views and excellent hiking. We arrived at the NPS headquarters not sure of which hikes would be best for a 4-5 hour excursion. All we knew for sure is that we wanted to go down into the canyon to see the Hoodoos. The ranger at the headquarters listened to what we had in mind distance and time wise and gave us a superb recommendation. If you have 4-6 hours and want to hike around 7 miles or so and go into the canyon his recommendation is spot on. We parked at Sunrise Point and took the Queens Garden trail to its concluding spot. Queens Garden is the easiest trail in the park. Doubling back about 100 yards we turned left onto the Navajo trail. The Navajo is a moderately difficult trail. We followed Navajo down the rest of the way into the canyon and back up to the point where it intersects with the Fairyland Loop, which is a strenuous trail. (Fairyland is strenuous due to the elevation changes, not the quality of the trail. The trail was exceptionally good, it just goes up and down and up and down and then up, up, up!) We took the right fork of Fairyland all the way through the bottom of the canyon and back up to Bryce Point. There we turned right and took the Rim Trail back to Sunrise Point. Rim trail is easy. Queens Garden was relatively busy compared to the other trails but by no means could it be called crowded. All along the way the views are stunning. As the light changes the Hoodoos look different and they look quite a bit different from the rim versus the bottom of the canyon. At a minimum, anyone who can do a 350 descent and return should do Queens Garden. One nice option if you are dead tired when you get back to Bryce Point is the shuttle system. You can take the free shuttle from there, Sunset Campground or Sunset Point back to Sunrise Point. From Bryce Point to Sunrise Point along the rim trail is about 2 miles so if you are tired after the climb up you can declare victory (after 5 miles) and ride to the car. Good boots or at a minimum good running shoes and water are essential on these hikes. It was 104 degrees during our hike but a slight breeze actually kept it comfortable. We both consumed about 2 quarts of water during our hike and needed a good bit more when we were done. A camera is also a good idea, you will see things you will want to take a picture of for sure.We didn't seem much wildlife other than birds although we read reports that there were some mountain lions in the park. The park and trails are very safe. The trails are wide, especially where there is a steep drop off to one side. There are plenty of resting places along the way and in one spot of the Navajo trail even restrooms. There isn't any water for humans on the trails we took but there is a trough for horses, so don't forget your water!This park is a gem that should be viewed from many angles. After your hike, drive up to Rainbow Point; about 15 miles to the southern end of the park for different views. If you have only one day at Bryce Canyon you can't beat the itinerary that we were given by the NPS ranger!","July 15, 2013",Great Park and Hiking,92,"Newnan, Georgia",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"I was not expecting the Grand Canyon to be surpassed. In a way that is impossible, but this wonderful place is just as stunning but in a different way. It is much smaller than her big neighbour but somehow the the smaller size makes you feel closer to one of natures wonders. The colours are astonishing and the beauty keeps you transfixed.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Visited in late June, although there was a heat wave 100+ plenty of breezes at the top of the canyon to keep you cool. If you have time drive to Rainbow Point, you can do it quicker than the books say and you will see many different views of the canyon. Hiked the Navajo Loop to Queens Garden trail, I would recommend going down the steeper Navajo Loop at Sunset Point and up the Queens Garden trail ending at Sunrise Point. Take plenty of water and enjoy the great up close views of the hoodoos in Bryce amphitheater.Navajo Loop is not well signed from the parking lot at Sunset Point, walk the trail to the canyon edge that starts at the bus stop and the trail head will be on the left by the fence.","July 15, 2013",great park,4,"Pittsburgh, PA",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We had never been to Bryce and did not know exactly what to expect. The views were both surprising and stunning. We arrived mid-morning in May and (up until Memorial Day) driving throughout the park was allowed. Thereafter shuttle busses are required. The air was crisp and there were some small patches of snow visible in places. The altitude at viewpoints reached 9,100 feet and walking around will tend to tire you more. There are many hiking trails available and the views never stop. I would recommend this time of year for serious hiking as the temperatures aren't high. It you are a scenic photographer, plan on taking lots and lots of photos. As the day progresses the look changes with shadows, clouds, etc and you can take a dozen pictures of the same spot and each may look different. If you are driving throughout the park, allow most of a day to see everything. If you are planning on hiking, either camp nearby or come back and spend more than one day exploring.","July 14, 2013",Don't miss this park!,80,"Lynden, Washington",5

With names like that one would think Sunset Point would be the better of the two campgrounds. Well its not true, they both are very good spots to camp and start your hike or just enjoy the park.Neither offers any advantage over the other.If camping in either campground be sure to note that in July and August afternoon showers are pretty normal so prepare.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is magnificent and well worth a visit. I was, however, somewhat surprised by the advice I was given by a ranger at the Visitor Information Centre. We stopped there in order to get a feel for what there was to see and do and some advice as to how our time might be best spent.It was late June and very, very hot. Our ranger suggested we could do the loop walk to get a feel for ""slot canyons"". He said it was shaded and we could do it comfortably in the heat of the day. He went on to say that the best time to visit Bryce was between 8 am and 4 pm, with the sun setting around 4pm.... Given that sunset in other parts of Utah had been around 8,30pm, I felt this a little odd but he was the expert and, I figured, who knew how the shadows fell. Anyways, the Loop walk was good but in no way resembled a slot canyon and was, by no stretch of the imagination a shaded and easy walk in the early-mid summer afternoon and come 4.00pm the sun was still blazing relentlessly. I am not sure what planet that ranger was on. Possibly not earth...??","July 12, 2013",how qualified are the rangers???,16,"Brisbane, Australia",4

Walking amongst the red/orange sandstone spires and tall conifers was awesome. Chipmunks scuttling across your path and humming birds darting around the greenery. I would not have missed this for the world. There are buses laid on to ferry you to the different vantage points around the Canyon.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This place is a great way to start your travels to see the natural wonders in Utah and Arizona. It's small enough that you can actually see most of the canyon from up above. It also doesn't take too long to walk through the mazes within the canyon. It is quite hot in the summer months if you choose to walk it, but if you stay up above and walk around the rim, it's cool because of the elevation. I actually liked Bryce Canyon better than the Grand Canyon because it is so accessible. The ""Hoodoos"" are so surreal at sundown. The colors of the rocks are just amazing in this kind of light and because there are so many of them in one place, it is like nothing I've ever seen.The only negative to going here (and I've found this to be true at most of the Western National Parks) is that it is quite a way off major highways and there are no really good places to eat or stay under almost 2 hours. I suppose that's the idea though, to be out in the wilderness away from modern conveniences. I just want others who have not been to Utah and Arizona to be aware of this and plan accordingly. It is still not to be missed and I would love to go back sometime.","July 11, 2013",Surreal,119,,5

It is nice that you can hike down into the amphitheater and back out in a very manageable day hike. With the higher elevation the temperature was comfortable even in late June. I would absolutely consider going back and staying at the lodge there for 2 nights so I could explore this park more thoroughly. We ate at the lodge, the food choices are varied and we enjoyed our lunch quite a bit. The Queens Garden/Navajo loop trail is amazing.

The road to emerald point is a must since their is a stark contrast between ponderosa forest, swamp plain and the amphitheater views. We also hiked the Mossy cave to the waterfall, this was one of the best hikes we did the water was so cool and refreshing we sat under the falls to cool off.

Don't overlook Inspiration Point, the highlight of all the splendid views.Hint for an extended drive after Bryce is the travel East on Hwy. 12 to Capitol Reef National Park.

There is a Visitor's Center with an orientation film which tells the discovery of this region by a Mormon preacher and his wife - the Bryces. They were sent by the church to travel and educate the people in that region and built a very small cabin with the canyon as their ""backyard."" They moved to other places with their message and the canyon grew in popularity over the years. I have not seen the Grand Canyon myself but I don't think that I am missing anything after seeing this.

We stopped at every viewpoint along the road and admired the fascinating park that was below us. Each viewpoint car park was either a few feet from the edge or a couple 100 yards walk away and was mainly flat paved paths.We found this park fascinating as you were looking down over the Pinnacles and spires as opposed to looking up all the time (which you do at most parks!) The varying colours were rich and the evening sunset was amazing, especially as there was a massive wildfire in the distance which gave the park a fabulous glow. We would love to have had more time to have been able to walk down into the hoodoos to have seen this park from below and not just from above.","June 28, 2013",Fascinating Park,59,"Rugby, United Kingdom",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We did 6 national parks in 2 weeks. This was by far my favorite. We went once during the day and saw all of the roadside points and took a few hikes. We went back another evening to see the sunset at sunset point and stayed for the stars. I felt like I was in a snow globe. Absolutely amazing. The staff at the store were not too helpful or friendly, but the overall experience was great.","June 27, 2013",This is my new favorite!,152,indianapolis,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We drove on the main road and stopped at most of the view points. The scenery is stunning. The best viewpoint was Inspiration Point where you can see the hoodoos. I have not seen rock formations like this at other parks. Very different from what you see at Zion and well worth a visit. Also, while the temps at Zion were near 100, it is much cooler at Bryce.","June 27, 2013",Spectacular scenery,170,Washington,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We took this trail in mid june, mid morning. We feared we had left too late to make the entire 8+ mile loop. But we had a fantastic trek. We started at the FAIRYLAND TRAIL HEAD about 10:30 AM. It was jaw dropping the entire trip. We had hiked slot canyon and the navaho/queens loop in the days before. Thought we couldn't see anything more spectacular but this loop provides just that. WOW. There are spare bits of shade by a tree or two almost the entire way. At this altitude (8,000) there was a nice gentle breeze that helped a lot to make the hike comfortable, even without a cloud in the sky. There was a nice complement of down and up throughout the hike - nothing very steep or breathtaking when taken at a nice pace. On our route (clockwise), we had a 1.7 mile fairly steep hike back up to the rim. It is not terribly steep but a steady climb and lots of trees to stop and take a breath under. We stopped at the sunrise canyon trail head and took the shuttle back to the entrance to fairyland trail head. They don't go into the parking area but it was a short mile back to our car, verses the 2.5 miles on the rim trail. Not a huge difference, but a nice break and kind of a blah last mile to the car. Our kids were 20, 16 and 14 so they did fine. I would say this hike would be a real challenge for anyone under 10. You should plan on lots of rest breaks, water, sunscreen and caps. It was our best hike of the entire canyon!","June 26, 2013",fairyland trail,20,,5

No words are adequate to describe what your eyes take in. It's hard to beleive that vivid colors such as these can be reproduced layer after layer in rock form of ""HooDoo's"" from the valley floor of Bryce raising up at times to eye level right in front of you from the elevated viewing points.Thank God for digital cameras as one could go broke shooting 35mm film ( which I did in the past).

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We wanted to get the full taste of Bryce while trying to avoid the crowds on the most popular 3 mile Queens Garden/Navajo loop trail. We started very early about 6am and went down the Navajo loop side. We had read that going up the Queens Garden side was easier coming out (or going UP, more on that later). Being out that early was wonderful, hardly any people. If you go during high season and you hike later in the day you will encounter a lot of tour busses. The Peek-a-boo loop trail was the best, it gave you the best views, there is a lot of ups and downs in the trail some fairly steep. You go from the canyon floor up into the hoo-doo's and back again give's you a much better perspective than just being on the QG/NL trail. If you take it slow most anyone can do this trail just give yourselves plenty of time and water. Going back out the Queen's Garden Trail is steep. It does not have as many switch backs as the Navajo side not sure if that is good or bad, the last part as you come up to Sunrise point is fairly steep and I was happy to be done. The Park Rangers recommend doing the hike clockwise (we went counter clockwise at the recommendations of other tripadvisor reviews). We saw 6 national parks in a 2 week period and Bryce was my favorite by far.","June 24, 2013",Great Hike!,12,"Yakima, Washington",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"17 miles of canyon rim drive. An exceptional experience, at your own pace, in your own vehicle, not a shuttle drive with chattering foreigners who cannot understand the narrative. Best advice was to go to the far lookout point and work back to the Visitor Center, because all the viewpoint pull-ins are on the right-hand side of the car. What a superlative job the engineers have fabricated for tourists. Plenty to see and photograph, in high safety, no need to park on dangerous corners, or blind bends.

If you have more time, go all the way to Yovimpa Point. But the important part is Bryce amphitheater. Be careful at the trail walk, there are no rails except on the points.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is one of the most spectacular natural areas I've seen. And there's much more than the canyon itself. The woods and meadows around the canyon support a large population of wildlife. We spotted quite a few deer and pronghorn... along with prairie dogs, rabbits, squirrels and numerous birds. To truly appreciate Bryce, hike down into the canyon - but bring plenty of water and leave plenty of time. Because it gets hot down there and it takes a lot longer getting out than it does going down. If you're just hitting the major tourist areas, drive to the end of the road and make your stops on the way back.

From the Rim Trail you get long vistas of unimaginable rock formations that changed in appearance every time we went back depending on the time of day and angle of the sun. Although starting at 7-8,000 feet in elevation it takes some stamina, I recommend hiking some of the trails that wind from the Rim Trail down among the hoodoos.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is a little off the beaten path. But take the scenic route to Zion and check out Bryce Canyon! Absolutely amazing what nature can produce. Take water if you are going to hike down into the canyon. There are many hikes, but know that tails that go down have to come back up! ;) For those who can't do that kind of hiking any more, the views from the rim are breathtaking and just as satisfying. Rubys Inn is a nice place to stay. They have a dinner show, old western photos, there's a rodeo in the area, a movie theater down the road in Panguitch. Rubys also has a camp ground and RV hookups. You can even stay in a TEEPEE!! There are laundry facilities and showers at the campground. Also a nice outdoor swimming pool and hot tub. If you stay at the campground you can also use the hotel's indoor swimming pool. There's also a shuttle bus that will take you into the park.

It was intersting and informative covering not only the geology of the area but also the plant life. Less good were the long queues for information at the Visitor Centre and msot disappointing was the closure of the Navajo loop trail. This was adverrtised in the newspaper style Map, Shuttle and Hiking Guide. The fact that the loop was closed was not mentioned until approaching Wall Street. It appears that this slot canyon is closed until the summer season. This should be more widely advertised.Temperatures can vary quite widely day by day. In mid-May the temperature was in the upper 40s on my first day, upper 50s on my second and was forecast to rise to 70 degrees on the day I left.","June 17, 2013",Good ranger talks,11,"Reading, England",4
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is almost too beautiful to put into words. We arrived at the Bryce Canyon Lodge in midafternoon and couldn't check in so we headed for the canyon rim to take a look. Coming up the path to the rim it appears that you are going off the end of the world and all of a sudden you are at the rim with the most amazing scenery below. At first glance, and maybe later glances as well, the whole scene looks like it can't be real but made up for a Disney movie. The hoodoos are really fun, coming in all shapes and sizes. And the colors.....just unbelievable!! That first day we hiked the Queen's Garden and Navajo Trails deep into the canyon and through some very nice forested areas. Going down was smooth and pretty easy but coming out of the canyon requires some heavy breathing and leg work. All was well worth the exertion. The next day we headed out on the Fairyland Loop Trail that was described as a moderate 8 mile hike. Some of the trail (the down part) might have been moderate but the end of the trail was a 850 ft climb out of the canyon in a 1.7 mile stretch. The scenery along the Rim Trail/Fairyland Loop varied from open mountain meadow/woodlands on the rim to barren moonscapes down in the canyon. There were areas where it was obvious that fires had scorched all of the trees. Lots of lizards to watch while we sat and ate out lunch in one of the many washes or dry creek beds. Most of the trail is in the Bryce Canyon Wilderness area so the trails are not maintained by the park service but were all very passable. This is a hike not to be missed in Bryce Canyon. Every time you turn around it is a post card shot and we ended up with hundreds of really nice pictures to remember the hike by. You will be glad that you went.","June 16, 2013",a surreal landscape,176,"Annapolis, Maryland",5

The trails and views are awesome, but some are so steep that the cliffs and drop-offs may be a concern for those with a fear of heights. We found a surprisingly beautiful hike along the Mossy Cave trail just outside of Bryce Canyon proper, which was easy and did not involve a lot of steep drop-offs. We also had to traverse trails with winds approaching 50 mph in early spring. This is something to add to your bucket list!","June 16, 2013",Absolutely breathtaking!,36,texas,5

There was an astronomy event taking place, so there were quite a few extra people in attendance for that, but there was still a lot of peace and solitude. We were here for 2 days. The evening temps were still quite cool, and the daytime temps were moderate to warm. The hikes here are wonderful - we were able to do three different hikes, but don't miss the drive out to the end of the road. The views are fantastic from some of the overlooks.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"During the busy season, Bryce Canyon park has a shuttle service which stops at the major view points. We entered from the north and took the shuttle bus from the visitor's center all the way to the last stop at Rainbow Point. We walked the short paths to the observation points. Then we took the bus north stopping Natural Bridge and then Inspiration Point. We walked a short distance to Inspiration Point overview (well worth it) and then walked the mostly downhill Rim hike from Inspiration Point to Sunset Point passing Bryce Amphitheater with an early audience (keep an eye out for the hoodoos which look like an audience) and Thor's Hammer. Then we hopped back on the shuttle to take it to Sunrise Point and access to the Queen's Garden trail. The Queen's Garden walk descends 320 feet below the rim with rest benches near the formation called Queen Victoria. On the way down you will pass the Boat Mesa, the sinking ship, Queen Victoria and her castle (these are easily recognizable with just a little imagination). I suggest you just note where they are on the way down because when you turn around to come back up, you will realize the trail was much steeper than you thought. That's why I suggest you take pictures on the way up. This will give you an excuse to stop frequently and catch your breath and you won't look like a wimp. This trail is really the best for seeing the most interesting hoodoos close up.The colors of the rock formations changed subtly throughout the day. Scenery was beautiful and unusual.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This was my fourth trip to Bryce Canyon, and the rock formations and colors are still awesome! (In fact, I think that Bryce has the best scenery of any National Park.) While I drove to the various view points, the shuttle bus system seems to be working well: I was always able to quickly find a parking place -- even though I was there on a Sunday in June. So the shuttle system has definitely reduced the number of cars in the park. The view points on the rim are above 8,000 feet, so temperatures are tolerable -- even in the summer. But for hiking, wear sunscreen and a wide-brimmed hat, and bring plenty of water. Also expect to stop and rest regularly -- the air is thin at this altitude!","June 13, 2013",Still Breathtaking!,108,"Lincoln, Nebraska",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon National Park is laid out in an 18 mile (one-way scenic drive). There are 14 view points and if you stop 15 minutes at each you would spend 3-4 hours at Bryce. There is an entrance gate, $25 a car, $12 on foot, motorcycle, etc., and for me $0.00 because I'm 62+ and bought a Lifetime Pass for $10. The visitor's center is about 100 feet from the entrance. Stop at the visitor's center.There is a free museum which is very informative. A 22 minute video, wildlife taxidermy, geology and more. Free WiFi, publications, backcountry permits, lost and found, shuttle service and most importantly Ranger advise. Tell them how long you plan to stay and they will develop an itinerary for you. This way you will get the most out of your stay.Most people do Sunrise, Sunset, Inspiration and Bryce point, That is where the amphitheatre can be viewed (Hoodoos). I think World of Warcraft (thousand Needles) was designed after the Hoodoos.As you travel further from the visitor's center (6,900')the elevation rises. At Rainbow point, the farthest point, it is 9115 feet. The oxygen level is 70 percent of oxygen at sea level. Figure in the heat and sometimes steep climbs on hikes if you plan on some of the hiking trails. You might want a guided tour on horseback into the canyon.After the amphitheatre view points are mostly about long distance views of up to 100 miles. Shuttles are free but only run to Rainbow Point twice a day. The other points every every 15 minutes. There are Ranger lead Geology talks, Rim Walk, Canyon Hikes, Astronomy lectures and telescope use and Full Moon Hikes which you need to sign up early for.Ruby's Inn located before the entrance has a Post Office, ATM and Internet. Speed limits in the park run 15-45 MPH. Yes, people are stopped and fined.

This turned out to be a good move because most of the views were to the left off the road and to do them heading South would have meant always crossing the opposing traffic. Going our way it was easy to just pull into the car park and hop out. The road surface is excellent and the car parks are very good. Amenities at far end were basic but when desperate certainly good enough.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce has been on my National Parks list for a while. The park did not disappoint! It's famous for hoodoos - pillars of eroded rock sculptures. The colors are fantastic! Ever changing in the sun and time of day.This is the second national park I visited in Utah. We only had a day, which was time for one hike and a peek at the major points of interest. Try to spend at least two days to make the most of your visit.In my opinion, the best way to experience the magnificence of this unique park is by foot. There are about 50 miles of trails ranging from easy to strenuous. Check at the visitor center to get the best trail for your ability and time frame. We took the Swamp Canyon Trail. Read about my experience under the trail's name in TripAdvisor.There is a $25 per car entrance fee, a great visitor center and a lovely lodge with reasonably priced dining. We had lunch in the lodge and the food was excellent. You can stay in the park if you are lucky enough to get reservations. If not, there are plenty of accommodations outside the park.The free shuttle doesn't cover the whole park. If you want, you can drive the scenic road which follows the plateau rim for 18 miles inside the park. If you choose the shuttle, it stops at the major scenic vistas like Inspiration, Sunrise, Sunset and Bryce Points. Since the elevation averages 8,000 ft, the park doesn't get as hot as Zion or Capitol Reef. So we could hike inside the canyon during the day without getting uncomfortable. (We were there late May.) We saw mule deer and an abundance of wild flowers. It was lush and beautiful on the Swamp Canyon trail. I would love to return to Bryce in winter and see its beauty with snow.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I've been to Bryce Canyon twice, and it is my favorite of all the parks in this area, including the Grand Canyon, simply because the scale of it is smaller - though it is still very large and impressive - so you can walk (or drive) around the rim and look down into the canyon, or you can hike down into it, and then hike up at various spots. There's great diversity in the different sections of the canyon. And great beauty. And there are hikes that are more demanding, or less demanding. The ranger station was bustling but it's well organized, with excellent maps and info and staff on hand to give advice about which hike might be best for you, etc. The entrance fee is about $25 if you're just going to Bryce, but the best deal is to buy a seasonal or annual pass that works for all of the state or national parks. But it's worth $25 or more, alone, and in spite of there being a lot of visitors it did not feel crowded. Also, just outside the park, we encountered a little rodeo late in the afternoon which was a charming addition to the day. I think those happen twice a week in the summer. It is a magical place, more special than photos can show.","June 6, 2013",Favorite Park in Southern Utah,99,"Glendale, New York",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce is a star in an all star lineup of National Parks. Here are some recommendations:Stay or camp IN the Park either at the Bryce Canyon Lodge or one of the campgrounds. Our cabin was a 2 minute walk to the rim, making it a great place to sip coffee during the sunrise. Stay 2-3 nights to relax and enjoy this gem.Go for a hike among the hoodoos- long or short hikes are available. Keep in mind the high altitude and that onece you've hiked into the canyon, it's all uphill hiking out. We hiked about 7 miles one evening, started on from our cabin to Sunset Point, hiked Navaho Loop, Peekaboo, then out via the Queen's Garden trail to Sunrise Point, then a short stroll along the rim to our cabin. It was a full moon that night so we timed it so we would finish the Peekaboo Loop at sunset, then when the full moon rose we strolled among the Queen's garden by moonlight - awesome!Attend a ranger talk- the Geology talk at Sunset Point was excellent. (For German speakers- they offer talks in German several times during the week).Be at the rim for a sunset- recommend Bryce Point or Inspiration Point. For sunrise, expert photographers actually prefer SUNSET point for photos- better lighting and fewer people. Also, before 0800 and after 1800 most of the tour buses are gone so the crowds diminish significantly.Go for a horseback ride IN the park- sign up at the lodge or book in advance.Take the time to visit all of the viewpoints in the park, each offers something different. The Bristlecone Pine loop at the end of the road is often overlooked.Get a National Park pass, it will save you money after visiting just 2-3 parks.","June 1, 2013",World Class National Park,80,"Seattle, Washington",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,Bryce Canyon is an absolute jewel of a National Park System. By National Park standards this is not a huge park. It can get very crowded. Here are some things we learned. Every viewpoint is magnificent and provides awesome vistas. Park your car outside of the park near Ruby's Inn. The shuttles run into the park.Take the shuttle. Even in May some of the parking lots were full and we saw vehicles being turned away from full parking lots. Stop at the Visitor Center to get oriented. The first stop for the regular park shuttle is at Bryce Point. This is the furthest stop from the visitor center. The shuttle takes a loop through the viewpoints near the visitor center. The shutlle runs in one direction. You can not go back to a stop without riding the whole length of the shuttle loop. We took the hike along the rim trail from Bryce Point to Inspiration Point. It was an easy/moderate hike. There is one point in the trail where the trail is about 4-5 feet wide and has drop offs on both sides. It's a little dicey for a person like me who doesn't like big drop offs. The trail has both downhill and uphill sections. The views are spectacular.There is a great tour to other sections of the park called the Rainbow tour. It is free but you need a reservation. The tour is 3 1/2 hours long and takes you out to Rainbow point with other stops on the way back. Well worth the time. Enjoy this remarkably beautiful place.,"May 31, 2013",A jewel of a National Park,43,"Bernalillo, New Mexico",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"This place is just one big WOW. Every vantage poin give stunning views of the fascinating geological strata and what erosion has created is a stunning vista that astounds from every direction.We decided to do the walk into the canyon, and oh boy is this worth doing. However, the brochure recommends that you enter at Sunrise point and return via Sunset point, which is great when you are 20 or 30, but almost kills you walking up the steep steep slope when you are nearing 60. Do it the other way round, and the way up will be longer but less steep.We wanted to take the horse ride into the canyon, but decided not too as it was way too hot, and judging by the walk we were probably right. Still that leaves something for our third visit when we get the chance to come back again.Not as organised as Zion, but if anything more impressive geologically. Don't miss it.If you are going to visit a number of National Parks, Monuments and Recreational Areas we suggest you get a Passport and an Annual Pass.

One-way drive from Springdale to Bryce was just under two hours. Even with stopping at most of the ""points"" and taking time to do the Bristlecone Loop Trail, we saw everything that we wanted to see in a little over four hours.We used our vehicle instead of the complimentary park shuttles that depart the Visitor Center frequently and transits between there and Bryce Point, making various stops. We were ""warned"" that parking at different ""points"" would be a challenge, but the only place we ""looked"" for parking was Bryce Point. We drove directly from the Visitor Center to Rainbow Point without encountering any traffic at all.The entrance fee station ranger was a bit nasty as she asked us if she didn't give us a complimentary (well, not really when we paid the $25 entry fee) park map, would it kill us?

The best views are Bryce Point and Sunset Point, the natural bridge (really an Arch) is also worth a look. Once you have seen Bryce point and Sunset point you have seen the best hoodoo's / rock formations in the park, so the rest really don't measure up.We have visited over 20 USA national parks and found this one to be the least interesting.Even though there is a shuttle bus to take you around the park we did use our car and had no problems with parking at the viewpoints.","May 26, 2013",Not the most interesting of national parks,152,"England, United Kingdom",3

Bryce Canyon National Park,"WOW. What Outstanding Wonder you will find yourself in the midst of whether from the top of a viewpoint or down in the canyon. Everywhere you turn there is more to see and all of it is breathtaking. I don't know why I should even write - there are already three Excellent tripadvisor ratings for this NP marvel, even for a person of limited abilities. I hope to go back in the future when my body has recovered.By National Park standards, Bryce is fairly small and one can seel most of it in a day as my husband and I did, without doing any serious hikes into the canyon (unable due to my disability currently.) BUT, I believe a strong able-bodied person could spend several days hiking around this place to see much more of it's splendor and glory.Don't miss Sunrise Point but be sure to arrive well BEFORE sunrise (we got there around an hour before and people were already beginning to position themselves for the best photo spots.) Also, don't forget your tripod (as I did!) You'll need it for the low light conditions. Although I must say my new Samsung Galaxy S4 managed to get pictures that were just as good or better than my Nikon D300! Go figure! Anyway, this is about Bryce and it's a great place to photograph for every level of shutterbug with whatever camera you're using. I can't say Sunset Point gave me the same thrill and to be honest, my husband and I left before the sun had even set. The crowds of people, even in mid-May when we were there, and lack of information were discouraging. We later read a brochure that mentioned Sunset Point was not the best place to photograph sunset in Bryce NP. Forgive me, I don't remember where we were told was better but that's something to check out when/if you go if photography is important to you.Take the time to stop at every turn-out with a look-out. You'd be surprised how different everything looks just a few hundred yards down the road with a new perspective. The Hoodoos, what the locals call the post-like formations that often look like robed people, are just the most interesting and amazing things. Pay attention to the park signs posted because they give great information about the geological formation of the Hoodoos. One never tires of viewing them from many angles.I wouldn't recommend this park for families with small children unless they're kids who love lots of hiking and viewing. We saw many very crabby children who were bored to death while their parents were enjoying themselves. This vacation might be better saved for when the kids are grown and gone, or to invite adult children along for an enjoyable time together.The weather while we were there 5/12-16/2013 was fabulous - low 70's and sunny during the day and chilly 40's-50's at night. It rained the Thursday we left for Nevada. Hopefully the rain didn't stick around to ruin the next round of tourists visit.It seemed everywhere we went we were the only visitors speaking english. This is a favorite attraction of tourists from all over the world as we encountered many Germans, Asians, French, Russian, and some whose dialect and accent we couldn't begin to guess. It's a trip well worth their travel as I'm sure there's nothing else like Bryce in all the world.Mobility is an issue for me and while I can walk with cane or walking stick. Nerve damage from back surgery has left me with a weak right ankle and left thigh so I'm unbalanced, unsteady and can't hike far without getting excruciating nerve pain and leg cramps. Sometimes when we travel to a place we know we'll be doing a lot of walking, we plan to get a wheelchair for me in case I need it. I didn't see that this would be a park easily traversed for someone wheelchair bound. But I wasn't really looking for that either. Handicapped persons could certainly do the drive through the park and stop at all the viewpoints. But unless they were able to get up from the chair, I'm not sure how much a person could see from that vantage point. Check with park management if this is something you need to plan for.There is a market of some sort in one of the campgrounds in the park. I believe it has some sort of deli as well. There is also quite a nice visitors center with gift shop and all. But the best bet for restaurants is just outside the park where there are a few choices. I'll be reviewing where we ate in another post.Hope you enjoy your visit. It's a wonderful place for couples, a person traveling alone (although it is nice to have someone to ooh and ah with,) photographers don't mind traveling alone and this is a photographers paradise. Teenagers might enjoy it but I could see them frantically trying to get cell service and freaking out because that's just not happening too many places out there. Older couples love this park. We saw lots of groups of college-aged friends (mostly Euro back-packers.)","May 24, 2013",One of the Marvels of God's Creation Plus Time & Elements,8,,5

Hiked the Rim Trail, which is not for those who are afraid of heights and is mildly strenuous at the altitude. It's a completely gorgeous and unique place--no bad photos, but it's hard to stop taking them! Even in mid-May, it was quite cold, windy, and drizzly, so be prepared for the weather and the elevation. Having said that, I would recommend this place without reservation.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"The national park is well worth the visit. I was there from May 12-16th 2013 with my parents aged 76 and 82. We stayed at Bryce Canyon resort just three miles from the park. There is a park fee of 25$ per private vehicle which I believe is waived if you have a National Parks pass. Use the shuttles to go into the park, they are free. There are two shuttles, one a three hour guided free guided tour that starts at the Bryce Canyon shuttle staging area opposite Rubys and goes to Rainbow and Yovimpa point. These are the farthest points towards the south of the park (40 miles round trip). To get on this shuttle you need to reserve a place by calling 1 435 834 5290. This shuttle stops in several places along the way so people can get out and look at the view points. The bus driver served as a tour guide and was very knowledgeable and patient. This shuttle stopped at the following points:Yovimpa PointRainbow pointAgua CanyonPonderosa pointNatural Bridge ( phenomenal dont miss)Fairview pointThis shittle does not stop at all the points in the park so between the two shuttles you might miss some points, I just drove my car and stopped at all the points I had not seen, though at some points it was very hard to get parking. The shuttle runs two tours at 9 am and 1pm. Carry some water and some snacks or food. Wear sensible shoes and carry a jacket it can get windy. Carry a camera of course!The second shuttle starting from the shuttle staging area is also free and drops and picks up people at various points along the park route. Each point has limited parking and most often all the spaces are taken which means you either miss seeing the point or endlessly stalk people until they give up their parking place :) This shuttle stops at the following:Shuttle Staging AreaRuby's InnRuby's Campground (Southbound only/along Main Road/does not enter campground)Bryce Canyon Visitor CenterSunset Campground (Southbound/on main road/does not enter campground)Bryce Point ( phenomenal dont miss)Inspiration Point ( phenomenal dont miss)Sunset Campground (Northbound/on main road/does not enter campground)Sunset Point .

This time we decided to walk two trails amongst the hoodoos: (1) The Navajo Loop Trail from Sunset Point; and (2) The Peekaboo Trail via the connecting trail from Bryce Point. Although the Navajo Loop Trail (marked as ""easy"") was crowded - and part of the trail was closed - it was a fun experience. But the Peekaboo Trail (marked as ""strenuous"") was an absolute delight. It was a well-constructed trail in outstanding scenery. There was hardly anybody using this trail which, most of the time, we had to ourselves.

We were there the first week of May and it was a little cold at night but great during the day.

Bryce Canyon National Park,At first I wasn't sure what all the hype was about. Bryce Canyon is mis-named ... it's not really a canyon and you don't drive into it ... you're driving on a ridge high above it. The entrance fee is $25 for 7 days. You can drive all the way to the end point - 18 miles ... with scenic points along the way to look down into the 'canyon'. THEN you can see what everyone's talking about. Each viewpoint is different and the colours and shapes are awesome. Note: the parking lots at each viewpoint can accommodate both cars and RV's but they can fill up quickly as some of them are the starting points for hikes. The park has an excellent shuttle bus service that picks up and drops off at many different points along the way and is an great alternative to driving and it's free! Camping in the park is limited and fills up VERY quickly in the summer - we were there in May and one campground was full although the other one was only about 1/2 full. Prices are $15 for an RV with 2 people per night. If you're looking at them on-line it's confusing as the on-line maps show 'North' Campground and 'South' Campground but when you get there it's North and SUNRISE campground. Not South. The North one is the first you come to and of course that fills up first - also it has a shower and general store inside the campground. The Sunrise is actually a little nicer tho I think. Both campgrounds have NO hookups at all so be warned. There are private campgrounds near with full hookups although they're pricey. There is a lodge also which looks pretty cool. It was built in the 1920's and just looks like it's out of a movie! I don't know the prices for the lodge. (There's also a very cool gift shop inside!)When you're in the park I highly suggest you take at least one of the day hikes. Being right in amongst the hoodoos cannot be described. But be warned ... there are short hikes of about an hour but 1. you are at a higher altitude with less air 2. it gets really hot on the trail - TAKE WATER and 3. it's uphill all the way back 4. there are no bathrooms. If you can tho ... DEFINITELY do one of them!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"One day was not enough! NOTE: If you don't have a National Park pass, consider getting one! My Senior pass @ $10 when I was 62 has been the best buy ever for access of 4-6 people as I take family & friends into parks like this and save $25 or more each time. We began at the visitors center a week before the seasonal shuttle started. You see Bryce Canyon from the top-down as the road takes you to the summit and you then descend back to the lodge and visitors center. That was good for us, as we defied the suggestion to drive to the top first. We pulled into each viewing area (making left turns) on our ascent to the summit. And we got some gr8 photos with the morning sun and avoided the crowds and parking issues that we saw on the return trip. We had lunch at the Bryce Lodge and it was excellent and reasonable. It also gave us another look at the diversity of the visitors (mostly foreign) and the park history.I'll return this fall and stay at Ruby's RV park in my motorhome next time for a few nights to do more hikes into the hoodoos, take advantage of ranger-led evening programs and really savor the nighttime stargazing and ambiance of the area.","May 10, 2013",Who Knew About Hoodoos?!?!,415,"Cardiff-by-the-Sea, California",4
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Our trip 's purpose was to visit 7 National Parks. Bryce was #7. We didn't know it, but we did save the best til last. The park can be appreciated from the numerous pull-off and view points with very little effort. Unlike Zion or Arches National Parks where hikers have the clear advantage. Bryce is breathtaking. We traveled in our own vehicle but later in the season a shuttle is used to get around in the park. We have the Senior life time National Park Pass ($10)The best value for your money ever if you are 60 years old or older. The park has a fee for those without the pass.","May 10, 2013",Photos can't due justice,96,"Oak Harbor,OH",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"The scenery, as with the other Utah National Parks, is spectacular. The Park is well maintained, well organized and a testament to the good work of the NPS. My problem with Bryce, is that the views for older people or those with disabilities and/or acrophobia are all from the top. The trails are steep and very dangerous. I would never want my younger grand children to venture on most of the trails. All the Parks have some dangerous trails, but they usually have other trails which enable tourists to walk inside the canyons. Tropical Reef is especially good at that. Bryce isn't.","May 10, 2013",Magnificent but with Caveats,51,"Columbia, South Carolina",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon's amphitheater provides extraordinary views and unusual hiking trails. Sunset and Sunrise Points give special perspective on the rock formations, long views, and play of light on the hoodoos in early morning and dusk. The Navajo and Queens Garden Trails are great walks and their switchbacks make the hike back up moderate. I do recommend hiking shoes with some lug traction. Next time, I hope to get dropped off at Fairyland Point and walk back to Sunset Point. The Lodge accommodations and meals are expensive, but its location is helpful.","May 9, 2013",Great views among the hoodoos,72,"Boone, North Carolina",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"After visiting Zion National park, we headed toward Bryce National Park. As you drive toward Bryce, you get on Highway 89, which then you exit Highway 12. Highway 12 is a classified as ""An All American Road"" and is the only highway in Utah to receive that distinction. An All American Road must meet certain criteria in order to receive this national classification. If you are lucky enough to travel the entire road, you will not be disappointed. It is very scenic, beautiful, and awe-inspiring. For future planning I would probably give myself about 2-3 days to travel this highway and make the stops to the state and national parks in order to get the full scope and appreciation of the natural beauty which awaits you at these various places.Now, getting back to my review of Bryce, although not as big or scenic as Zion, it is still worth the drive. You can pretty much take everything in that Bryce has to offer in one day. There are a couple of easy family hikes which are about 3 miles long that you can take to appreciate the rock formation up close. The hike we took was easy, with no real dangerous cliffs to worry about. The kids enjoyed the hike. You should make sure to take plenty of water and snacks for the hike. It will take you about 2 hours to complete the hike. We only took the one hike, but in the future we plan to take a few more hikes at Bryce.","May 8, 2013",A Must-See While in Utah,117,"Whittier, CA",5

It was a long day(16 hours) but well worth it. I have some amazing photos. Just be aware it can get chilly up there, it's 8,300 feet up, and you can feel the effects of altitude if you over exert yourself. Wear hiking boots or sturdy shoes.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Yes another review from Europeans!We had 2 days here, we started with the scenic drive visiting all the overlooks in the return trip, the views are amazing but are just a taster of what is to come when we get the walking boots on later.We hiked the combined Queen's Garden/ Navajo trail, unfortunately the wall street section is blocked by a landslip so you can get .25 of a mile to the blockage but have to retrace your steps, there are many photo opportunities, so take a big memory card. There will be a lot of people on some sections, some clearly struggling with the incline and the heat, this is a proper hike.We called in at the general store, which is a historical building preserved the way it was first built. You can get camping supplies, ice-cream and has a small café.Outside of the park entrance the Fairy Canyon is a lot quieter and worth a look. A short drive away is the Mossy Cave trail which is a short walk with unusual features - a man made irrigation river and the original natural source from the cave which was still frozen when we visited in early May.In the evening we were lucky enough to attend a free talk with Ranger JJ talking about the black bears of Bryce, he is a superb speaker.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Just left Bryce after camping in the North Campground for 3 days. It's a large campground but many of the sites are very difficult to get level in. All of the UT Nat'l Parks are crowded with rental RVs. Apparently this is a very popular and inexpensive time for Europeans to visit. Anyway, Bryce is eye-popping and a must-see. HOWEVER, please remember that you are in a National Park protected by federal regulation in order to preserve the area for generations to come. It's what our National Parks system is all about. In one day I observed people riding bicycles where bicycles are prohibited; I observed an unleashed dog with its owners off and on the trails which is prohibited (this is not a good place to travel with your dog); and I observed people constantly trampling the vegetation off the trails or hiking off the trails even though this is also prohibited. Sometimes there are even signs about the vegetation with pictures but folks just ignored these regulations and requests. Perhaps it is the language barrier? I was very saddened by the lack of respect shown for this exceptional area. As a result, my experience was not what it should have or could have been. I left there this morning feeling heartbroken and very sad.","May 5, 2013",Protect OUR National Parks. PLEASE!,188,"Arvada, Colorado",5

Some of the best pictures I've ever taken which I owe to the bright, clear days and the vivid canyon colors. Very walkable and you can drive right up to a number of scenic lookups located all along the one main road that runs thru the park. The historic lodge at the park is a classic, ate breakfast, lunch and dinner there, a bit pricey but great wait staff.

Sunset Point has an extensive switch-back to get to the bottom of the canyon; you do NOT want to face it at the end of your hike. So start with it; walk the easy one hour over to Sunrise Point and then walk along the crest looking down at the hoodoos on your way back to your car. This is a definite 'bucket list' item.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is a feast for the eyes. If you didn't see it for yourself you would ever believe it. I recently had the rare treat of seeing Bryce covered in snow. A real treat for me as I have only seen it during the dry seasons before. The winds can be quite fierce at some of the overlooks so if you go in winter and through May, take gloves, coats and cover your head. Regardless of when you experience Bryce, it is truly that, a unique experience that you will remember the rest of your life. As always, a good camera with fresh batteries is a must as you will stop and marvel at the creations before you. Limited number of toilets. Bryce is a 15 mile long, one way in and one way out drive. There is a campground and small lodge but accommodations, fuel and food are before the park entrance. A must see attraction!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"As all here have said, the views are breathtaking and spectacular. First, I would reccommend driving to the very top to get an overview of all the possible walking trails - there are many, with different difficulty levels. And do get out at the different rest stops and walk the short trails - each is a bit different and panoramic.We were there in March with snow still accenting the brilliant oranges and pinks of the hoodoos. There weren't too many people and it was cold (so prepare, if you come this time of year). We got up early to see Sunrise point and it was 19 degrees at day break, but oh, so worth it. We headed down the trail from Sunset point (1/2 mile easy walk from Sunrise point) and literally saw 3 people the first 2 hours. It was like being on the moon. Surreal. (Navaho trail was closed at the top because of the icey conditions, but we were able to take Sunrise/Queens trail down and then backtrack partway back into the canyon from the bottom). I'd definately reccommend taking at least one trail down into the canyon, as you get a different perspective looking up. It was not a terribly difficult walk (I'm 59 and in decent shape), though bring water and allow some time as the altitude makes it a bit more challenging. The photo ops are everywhere. You won't be sorry.","April 13, 2013",A Must See on your Bucket List,15,"Burlingame, CA",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"It's sometimes hard to believe that nature can look this phenomenal ... naturally, without any help from people. The views in Bryce Canyon have got to be some of the most beautiful and unique in the entire world. In my book, it's even more spectacular than the Grand Canyon. We did not spend nearly long enough there because we were just stopping through on our drive to California. But it was well worth the detour!! It would be a neat destination trip, so you'd have time to do some of the hikes down into the canyon. But even if you're just passing through, it's absolutely worth seeing.I should mention, however, that it was freakishly cold when we were there at the end of March. Our car themometer said 19* and that didn't include the frigid wind, which almost certainly brough the wind-chill temps well below zero. We weren't dressed for such cold, so that's another reason we didn't spend all that long in the park. It's also fairly high in elevation, so it tends to be cooler than other Utah parks like Arches and Zion's (which could be a real plus if visiting in the summer.) So be prepared and dress in layers, possibly quite heavy layers if it's as cold as it was the day we were there. You'll appreciate the fabulous views more if you aren't freezing.","April 12, 2013",Breathtaking views!,130,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"The park entrance fee was $25, and this gives you a one week permit. There are other types of permits, such as annual but I do not recall the cost of those. It's very well maintained. The roads are in excellent condition and you won't find trash anywhere. Hats off to the park management for this. From what I experienced, there are basically two options in Bryce Canyon - the view points, and hiking. The viewpoints can easily be covered by afternoon if you start in the morning. We saw all of them and spent a decent amount of time at each one.The next day we took a hike on the Navajo Loop which gave a different perspective - actually inside the canyon. Getting from top to bottom was not difficult and there were many families with young children that were able to do this. Coming up is harder as the altitude makes you exhausted quickly. If you get out of breath just make stops every now and then and be sure to walk slowly. The entire hike up and down couldn't have been more than 1.5 hours. You could cover what we did in a day, but two would be more relaxing. Don't forget to check out the Mossy Cave trail (Not inside the park, no permit needed) and the Red Canyon. Both are very interesting, easy to get to, and contain hard far fewer crowds. The only bad thing I have to say about Bryce Canyon has nothing to do with the park (Hence I gave it a 5-star rating) but rather with the city. The food options are limited, over-priced, and bland. Not a good combination. People working in the town/restaurants are very friendly though.","April 10, 2013",Simply stunning,30,"San Francisco, California",5

The first afternoon we did a car scenery ride and stopped at several points. The next morning, we did the Queen's/Navajo loop in the recommended clockwise direction starting at Sunrise point and ending at Sunset Point (where we parked our car). The descent of Queen's Garden was fine, but the ascent of the Navajo trail was steep, yet doable at your own pace. That's almost 3 miles. In the afternoon, we walked part way on the Peekaboo Loop.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Photos just can't do justice to what the naked eye can encompass when it comes to Bryce Canyon. It is a geological amusement park and a true showcase of the artistic nature of the natural world.Walking towards the rim from the Sunset/Sunrise Point parking lot, one is slowly teased as you get peeks through the trees until all is slowly revealed once you get to the edge. The view is breathtaking and one can only stand in awe and try to burn it into their memory.There are several trails, some that will take you about an hour to walk, others several hours. Keep in mind you are at altitude, roughly 8000' above sea level and it is not too difficult to over exert yourself and find yourself grasping for air especially if you are out of shape! If you are planning on any hikes in the park, take ample amounts of water with you. I recommend no less 1.5liters for a 40min hike and more so for longer hikes. A 2 liter or more water bladder is indispensable! There are fountains to refill your water containers by the parking lot of the Sunrise Point but not sure about the other trail head/parking lots. Once you get onto the trails, you are on your own! There are no refill stations along the trails.On the easier trails, there are lots of younger children and can be busy at times. The longer hikes are MUCH less crowded and a lot more peaceful. One of the trails I did was the Tower Bridge which starts near the Sunset Point observation platform. Getting down to the arch took approx 35mins at a decent pace as it was mostly all downhill. Getting back took close to an hour and lugging close to 20lbs of camera gear plus water (which I had managed to finish well before the end of the hike!) in midday sun might not have been the smartest thing I've done but it was a beautiful hike.Some photography tips. Sunrise Point is probably better for sunrise shots and Sunrise Point seems better suite for sunset shots. Best times to get shots of Thor's Hammer would be early morning just after sunrise as the warm sunlight just makes everything glow a brilliant orange. A circular polarizer will help turn your skies to a dark indigo BUT it is VERY easy to get uneven coloured skies if you shoot anything wider than 50mm with it. You may be able to get away if there are clouds in the sky but if it is a clear, cloudless day, watch out!Take lots of memory and well charged batteries for your camera! If you can afford to, pay the premium and stay at one of the cabins within the park. There is a cafeteria/giftshop near the lodge for a quick cheap lunch or you can eat at the restaurant at the lodge.The main observation area at the amphitheater is handicap friendly.

The small group were from a divserse range of backgrounds and that made the day even more interesting.Our first stop was Zion Canyon. The sights were brilliant and the road and engineering feats to provide roadway access through this canyon was a marvel. We then moved on to Bryce Canyon, along the way we stopped briefy a number of times for photo opportunites and comfort stops. Bill managed all of these stops with diplomacy and consideration for all.Once at Bryce Canyon were provided with 3 x 45 minute stops at different lookout points which provided more than enough photo opportunites from different perspectives and showed the changing colous and textures of the canyon as the sunlight moved from one side to the other.The trip home was via the main interstate arriving home early the evening.

It's limited to 30 people and is very popular. We had a wonderful short hike in the moonlight as well as a talk about nocturnal animals of the canyon. I learned a few new things which is always good.I'd also like to suggest Hat Shop Trail which is not listed on Tripadvisor. It's a good moderate hike. 4 miles long with 1000 ft vertical.

Amazing scenery, friendly staff at the park info centre and no huge crowds. Even though we are Canadian, we purchased a US state park year pass... Very worthwhile since we visit the US 2x per year. The boys loved the hike into the canyon and my husband took hundreds of pictures. The snow in the canyon this time of year makes the red rocks glow and the temperature was good for hiking. We also visited the Grand Canyon on the trip, but honestly, we enjoyed Bryce much more. The Grand Canyon was, of course, spectacular, but the crowds of people, the fighting for parking and most of all the agree of watching people do silly things so close to the edges (I can see why people have unfortunately fallen there) really took much away from our enjoyment.

I don't think there's a place like it in the world.The hike itself is pretty straightforward - there are clear paths that you follow around, to give you a good view points of various places and highlights within the national park.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This was our second trip with Adventure Photo Tours, and was really looking forward to it, as we had been well looked after before. Another early start from LV about 5.45am, and again we had Alex so was pleased about that as he made our last trip most enjoyable. As before, he was his happy, cheerful, informative self. We drove through some interesting scenery with a short bathroom break along the way. We reached Zion National Park mid morning and the sun was shining, and the scenery was amazing. We saw some local wildlife whilst there – some very pretty moose deer –so called because of their big ears. The snow on the ground also added to the beauty of the scenery, the massive rock structures, and wide flowing creeks. We had a short stop for a walk at the entrance to some Canyons, but we didn’t have enough time to go too far and see all the beautiful sights there were to see, but what we saw was gorgeous. It was also quite chilly. Before we left this stop we were given our lunch box, which we were looking forward to after the Hollywood Tour as it was superb, but we were sadly disappointed, as after receiving a luxuriously filled wrap on our first trip, on this one we only received what appeared like a very small homemade very dry ham & cheese sandwich, and this tour was more expensive than the other one, so we were extremely disappointed. We carried on our way through the amazing canyon, and also stopped to get out and see the rock formation called the Court of the Patriachs, which were magnificent. On our way to our next port of call we went up and through a canyon where the colour of the rocks was spectacular. We had plenty of photo stops, and Alex gave us good information along the way, plus he was very good at taking photos of us when we stopped at the photo points. Zion National Park was amazing, but then it was time to head towards Bryce Canyon. Along the way we saw Buffalo and snow covered areas and more breathtaking rock scenery before we got to Bryce. When we arrived the temperature seemed to have dropped quite a bit more and was very, very cold! The snow and ice gave the canyon a different perspective, and along the way we passed some long icicles which were very pretty. We stopped here for an hour, but we didn’t go on the walk as it was very snowy and icy and as it was downhill, looked to us a bit too icy and a bit dangerous, and also it was extremely cold, but the views from the top anyway were absolutely breathtaking. We then went onto Bryce Point, another area of Bryce, and another extremely cold location, which again had more breathtaking rock formations and on a warmer day would have been great to explore, as would have been the stop before. We were given three quarters of an hour here, but all of us on the trip went out to the view point to see the breathtaking views then we all got back on the bus as it was too cold. Which was a shame, as it some good walks to go on. We went through a couple of towns on the way back, and the sunset was very colourful too. There was also a bathroom break on the way back, which gave us a stretch of the legs. A lot reviews regarded this type of tour as a waste and didn’t give you enough time to see the area. If like us though, you only had a short time in Nevada, for us we thoroughly enjoyed our day trip and saw some amazing and spectacular scenery, and are very glad we went. Yes, it was a long day for a short time there, but we would rather have had this fantastic day experience and seen a bit, rather than not go at all and miss everything. The only let down for us was the lunch, as for an expensive tour, we expected a bit more than a small dry homemade sandwich and a few snack bits.","February 25, 2013",Bryce/Zion Day Tour - truly spectacular!,7,"Epping, Essex",5

Bryce Canyon was the most scenic part of the entire trip and the most scenic place I've ever seen. Not to take away from the rest of Utah because any other spot was better then any place in the East and still amazing. One note about Bryce is you must get up early to see the sunrise at sunrise point. Spend at least one night in the area so you can get the chance to see it. We drove through the park road and hit all the overlooks. After doing a lot of hiking in Zion the prior 3 days we stuck to just the Navajo and Queen Loop trail. A note on this trail start at the Navajo side not the Queen side as its ""suggested"". I don't know why they suggest it that way but its stupid to climb up a steep switchback at the end.. We were here the first week of October when it was around freezing at night but warm during the day. We only spent one day at Bryce and got to drive the entire loop and hike the one trail. We left around 4ish for Grand Staircase so its possible to fit more if spending more time at the park. Another note to anyone going please don't think that if you saw one park in Utah you've seen them all. It was really something to see the different landscape between the parks.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We traveled southern Utah from early to late November 2012, part of an awesome road trip we had been planning for months.While everywhere we went was brilliant, Bryce canyon was a particular favourite for me, especially coupled with the accommodation we had at Ruby's Inn. Reading ( albeit briefly) the family history of Ruby's Inn,made the place even a little more special for me.While it was beginning to get cold, and we had a dusting of snow, it only added to the spectacle we were seeing. Its all very clean and organised, with beautifully thought out fencing that marries well with the scenery, viewing points and well sign posted trails and walkways. Most of the upper levels are wheel chair friendly.I imagine in the warmer months it is very busy, but think the cooler temperatures made exploring the park much more comfortable.I have to thank Trip Advisors Destination Experts for helping plan this trip. We had no idea what to see as priorities until talking to them. While there's not much in the way of entertainment at this time of year ( so much closed for the winter) we still managed to fill our days with walks/ hikes and too hundreds of photographs.... trying to get the perfect shot, we met some wonderful characters and made great friends that added colour to our experience.I loved all the national parks in Utah. Not being a particularly active person generally I challenged myself daily with the hikes we did and the heights we'd climb. Would do it all again ain a heart beat.one piece of advice I would offer to others doing a tour of the national parks would be to purchase an Annual Park Pass. we didn't realise until well into our journey just how good this could be. Having earlier in the trip visited and then re visited parks in Hawaii, we could have saved substantially. Reading other reviews that place it above Grand Canyon, I fully appreciate their sentiment, but Bryce and all the Utah Parks each have something different to offer, that I find it hard to compare them. I suppose Grand canyon, was a place I'd seen in pictures and television growing up, that I had an idea of what to expect These National Parks were so new to me so the Grand Canyon almost paled in significance.","January 16, 2013",Awesome,12,"Newcastle, Australia",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce is one of the best NPs in south Utah. You get the spectacular views and hikes with less crowd compared to Zion and Grand Canyon (South Rim). We did the Navajo trail with 3 young kids, that's all they could do as it was a moderate hike with changes in elevation. Be sure to join in a Ranger talk to understand how the hoodoos are formed. We spent the rest of the day doing the scenic drive all the way to Rainbow Pt. Bryce is different from the rest of the NPs in the area and its well worth spending a day. We stay at the nearby Best Western which was near the park entrance, they gave a good recommendation for a local dining place a few miles down the road which was great.","January 11, 2013",Yes - Bryce is better than Grand Canyon.,66,"Beaumont, Texas",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Yes, it's true. Bryce is just drop dead beautiful and unique. Definitely on the bucket list. And it's even more beautiful in the winter, with the orange, pink rocks topped by the snow. However, if you decide to go in winter (and it's well worth it), you should be prepared.After Nov. 1, almost everything in Bryce closes down, including the Lodge in the park, and most local restaurants, until April. (The NPS in Bryce goes back onto 'regular' hours on April 7, 2013). The only place we found to eat was the dreadful Ruby's Inn Buffet/Steak Room. I recommend eating at the nearest town before you enter the park, or bring food you can microwave in your hotel room.Because of the high elevation, there will likely be snow well into early spring. It does not appear that the snowy trails, even those from the parking lots to the lookout points, are cleared. That means they are likely to be slippery with all the melting/refreezing snow. The NPS at Bryce doesn't recommend wearing tennis shoes on the trails, even in the summer. When I was there, I saw a lot of tennis shoe folks slipping and sliding. If you don't want to buy special shoes just for this visit, you might consider 'shoe chains' to cover your shoes, (sold at the NPS Visitors Center if you don't get them online first).Note: it is possible to see the park just by making a circular drive, and checking out the viewpoints from each of the pullout stops. However, it is well worth the time to take at least one, short trail that gets you below the edge of the rim. You get an entirely different perspective; it's like you're seeing a whole new park. The Queen's Garden trail (leaving from the Sunrise parking lot) is an easy, pleasant walk with surprising vistas.","January 10, 2013",Even more spectacular in winter: but be prepared,452,"camarillo, ca",5

We also visited both rims at Grand Canyon, Zion NP, Grand Staircase Escalante NM, Red Canyon State Park, Dixie National Forest...and the list goes on! BRYCE CANYON NATIONAL PARK WAS THE MOST AMAZING!!!!!!!!We stayed at Ruby's Campgournd while we were in Bryce & it can't be beat...it is a little expensive for camping, but worth every penny for the experience you will get. Try to do a sunrise hike. We did the Navajo Loop Trail at 5:00 am then went to Ruby's for their breakfast buffet. It made for a memorable family adventure. We also hiked Rainbow Point and another right there, but I can't remember what it was called off the top of my head. We did not hike Fairyland, but we enjoyed the overlook immensely...and my son & husband hiked Mossy Oak and the pictures were great!June was perfect, temperature/weather wise. Being from Texas, June is HOT! We woke up on June 13th to 34 degrees...fantastic :) Be sure to spend at least one full day here...two will probably get to everything if you don't go anywhere else, three days would be a luxury at a slow pace, really enjoying yourself.

At Bryce Canyon, there’s Thor’s Hammer, Queen Victoria and the Three Wise Men, along with goblins, temples and cathedrals. Stare at these rocks long enough and you can come up with your own list. My brother and I played that game as we hiked the Navajo Loop and Queen’s Garden trails through Bryce Canyon, a gigantic rock garden that can spark anyone’s imagination.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited Bryce Canyon as part of our trip over the Zion National Park from Page, AZ. We were expecting beautiful rock formations, but not as beautiful as we saw. We used a lot of TA reviews and pointers to figure out if we were going to drive through the park and pull off at overlooks or if we were going to add in a hike. It is easiest to see the park by stopping at the park entrance/information center, getting a map, and then driving to the one of the further away over looks as most of them are on the left hand side of the road. We drove about 20-30 mins, turned around and then began stopping at the overlooks. We visited the park after lunch time so we missed the sunrise at Sunrise Point, however it was still beautiful. We parked at the Sunrise Point parking area and did the Navajo Trail from there to Sunset Point. The trail was steep at points and is about 3 miles. In the beginning of the trail it is a steady hike down and then you're on part of the canyon floor. On the way back up to Sunset Point, you are climbing back up to the rim and that was the hardest part of the hike. Leave yourself about 2 hours to do it and also let yourself rest in between difficult parts. Definitely a great hike and you get to see so many hoodoos and rock structures. There is a $25 fee for entrance to the park, but with the America The Beautiful Pass ($80 p/ year), you can enter for ""free."" If you plan on visiting 3-4 parks on your trip, the ATB pass is a wonderful deal and you're contributing to our national parks.","January 5, 2013",Beauty that can't be tamed by a camera,81,"Knightdale, North Carolina",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We drove in after a stay in Saint George (~2.5 hour drive). The day started off with a clear sky and temps in the low teens with a slight breeze. In all my travels through the Utah canyons, this is by far the most colorful. The limestone hoodoos range from a soft pink to a brilliant orange that I have not experienced anywhere else (to date). You are able to drive the park in roughly 45 minutes, not including stops at each of the overlooks. We drove to the end and then stopped at each overlook and trail head on the way out of the park for a total stay time of roughly 4 hours. If you plan on a driving tour, I do recommend starting at the end as the park guide suggests. I plan on returning to the park next year during the summer months to spend some quality camping time here. An awesome experience.","January 3, 2013",Amazing Colors,11,"Denton, Texas, USA",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Family visited Bryce on the two days after Xmas. I highly recommend a visit at this time of year to get a different feeling for this magical place. We arrived in a snowstorm but left in sunshine. The snow was deep everywhere and it never got above 20 degrees--down to zero at night. But the views were special--the hoodoos covered with snow!! Also not many folks around--so services are limited and for short time the park roads to outlying venues were closed. They reopen quickly however and if you don't mind driving in the snow, provided more great chances to see the great views.Would love to come back in the warmth and hike into the canyon.

We ended up being there late enough to see how the evening sun changes the colors to translucent. Very strange place.It can get a little warm so bring a ton of water. Plenty of places to hide in the shade. Kind steep and tough on the last leg out.

The white against the red stone, and the bright blue sky was a gift. Another gift was bestowed upon us; we entered the park admission-free. Not sure if it was because of the Holiday, or the fact that part of the roads were closed due to snow. Anyway, we were still able to make it to several viewpoints to enjoy the astounding views. I had not been here since I was a child. Dress warm, wear snow gear, and watch your driving in this kind of weather and season.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited Bryce just after Christmas, on a day trip from our base at Springdale, Zion. There had been heavy snowfall, and we decided not to hike the back country but just enjoy the scenic drive and viewing points. The road is 17 miles each way, but due to hazardous conditions the final 4 miles were closed. The park was covered in snow, but there were still mule deer to be seen grazing beside the road. The viewing points are quite breath-taking, with a range of hoodoos, natural bridges, arches and grottos, in shades from deep orange through cream. The most spectacular, in our view, was Bryce Point,though this was probably the only viewing location that would be challenging for wheelchair access. The visitor center at the north end of the park is well laid out, warm and inviting. There's up to the minute information on weather conditions in the surrounding area, a video show and a small child-friendly museum, as well as a shop selling hiking accessories, maps and the inevitable (but not overly expensive) souvenirs. There are restrooms here, but we didn't see any others around the park. In Spring through Fall there's a shuttle bus service through the park, but it's not compulsory as it is in neighboring Zion National Park.Cost for car entry is $25 (same as Zion) but this is good for 7 days.","December 27, 2012",Wonderful winter wonderland,57,"Northampton, United Kingdom",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is my preferred nature wonder in Utah. Better than Arches, better than Zion, better than Canyonlands, certainly more accessible than Coyote Buttes (South or North). You just HAVE to see Bryce Point at sunrise: the red rocks turn into glowing pink candles and the white tips become golden, here and there the green spot of an evergreen just makes it all sound right.For sunset, of course, Sunset Point is great, I look at it and the hoodoos look the like hundreds of clay Chinese warriors from the Ming dynasty that were found buried centuries ago.TIP: go in off-season; not only is the place much less crowded but the light allows for better photography. If you go in December, you might get lucky and see some white dust atop the red rocks. And don't worry about lodging, there is plenty, I like to stay at the lodge inside the park, this way you can get up early and be there at sunrise. Check the sunrise time the day before and be there prepared: the miracle only lasts about 10 minutes or less.When you leave Bryce, continue East through Red Canyon, spectacular red rock formations nested in luscious evergreen forest. They remind me of Garden of the Gods near Colorado Springs, Colorado. Spend the night in one of the many available places in Panguitch. Panguitch is Indian for Big Fish, appartently that's what you get in the near by Panguitch lake.Panguitch itself is a quaint little village with some authentic old Western architecture on Main street and all new construction in red brick Western style.","December 15, 2012",SEEING BRYCE POINT AT SUNRISE - PUT THIS ON YOUR BUCKET LIST!,1207,"New York City, New York",5

That's fine: drive all the way to Rainbow Point and then make one's way back to visit Natural Bridge (an arch, actually), Farview, Paria View, Bryce Point. But eventually, one needs to stop and get INTO the park. Hike the Navajo and Queen's Garden loops to start, but return again and venture further, taking Peek-a-Boo, Fairyland, Hat Shop and, if you have time, Under-the-Rim.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"A geological marvel, Bryce Canyon isn't, in fact, a canyon. To be accurate, it's an ""ampitheater."" Canyons are created by the erosive effect of water carving its way through rock on its way to sea level. Bryce is formed by the repeated freezing and thawing of water which seeps into the soft rock, causing it to fracture which results in the fascinating spires (called ""hoodoos"") and structures on display.The most impressive sights can be seen from between the companion vistas, Sunrise Point and Sunset Point. It's a short walk between the two. Thor's Hammer is perhaps the most photographed hoodoo, but there are others as well: The Sinking Ship, Wall Street, The Alligator, The Wall of Windows, and more. As the title suggests, it's nigh impossible to take a bad photograph here. What's more, the ever-changing sunlight changes the view without even having to take a step!Hiking trails abound, but caution is advised: There are few handrails, and the altitude (8,000 ft. above sea level) can make hiking an arduous -- but rewarding -- task.There is a lodge in the park, and other lodging is available nearby. Dining is simple, but ample. This is a worthy trip, and the images will be burnt into your mind for the rest of your life!","December 13, 2012",Impossible to take a bad photo!,45,"Ashburn, Virginia",5

However, when we arrived back to the top of the rim, there was a presentation or talk from a park ranger about Bryce Canyon. OUTSTANDING !! DO NOT MISS THIS EXCELLENT LESSON IN GEOLOGY. I know...you're thinking, boring. IT WAS ENTERTAINING, INTERESTING, AND EDUCATIONAL. It starts around 1130am. Check with the visitor center about actual times and location.

Although we only had one full day at the Canyon, we were determined to make the most of our time. We started at Sunset Point as that is where the Navajo Loop finishes and the closest to were we woudl finish which seemed like a good thing. We then walked along the top of the rim to Sunrise Point, then down into the canyon and followed the Queen's Garden trail before coming back up the Wall Street side of the Navajo Loop. This last section is steep but well worth the effort to walk between the high walls. We stopped at the top to use the restrooms and have a bite of lunch before setting off down again.After lunch we descended the Navajo Loop via the Thor's Hammer side and then followed the Peekaboo Loop where the view changed around every corner and definitely lived up to its name! This time we came back up via Thors Hammer and I think it is the slightly easier ascent. The park was very quiet and we had the trails mostly to ourselves. I live at sea level but am fairly active and found that all the trails were very doable as they are on well defined, well maintained paths, they just go UP and DOWN a lot ... remember it's all about stopping to breathe and admire the view! And when the views are this good, there's no problem in stopping.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Upon the first arrival, driving into the national park, there is not much to see.Best is to drive all the way down untill the last observation point : ""Rainbow point"" and start your way from there driving back to the entrance and visiting the points from the last to the first. That way you will climb to a climax with the views.So we got out at the last observation point, still nothing to see, you walk up the path, and just over the railing there you can see a first glimps of what you came for... It litteraly gives you a first jaw-dropping moment !! It is incredible... just wahw ! But more beautifull will come each time you get out of your car. The ones who get tired after stopping for a few times and decide to stay in the car are realy petty... You realy need to get out of your car and walk up to the observation points. It will keep surprising you and keep wahw-ing you.There is a nice walk from sunrise point down into the hoodoos... quite steep but amazing.To stay untill sunset gives you also great views on the hoodoos..Just amazaing ! This is one you realy have to see yourself ! A must !","November 5, 2012",wahw !! just incredible !,25,"Monroe, Michigan",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,Bryce Canyon is distinctively different from both Grand Canyon and Zion. You can easily visit all the lookouts in a day and probably take a hike or two. It was beautiful and the sunset on the hoodoos looked like fire at Sunset Point. Be sure to visit the visitor's center and view the short film and get a brochure with map. I wish we had more time so we could explore the trails but we didn't arrive until afternoon and it was too late to do a hike.,"November 2, 2012",You Can See It In A Day,214,"McMurray, Pennsylvania",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Viewing the various sites at this national park is easyl and convenient. You drive down this dead end highway for 17 miles or so, turn around, and drive back, stopping at appx. 10 different viewing sites. I visited in October, and there were only moderate crowds. Many of the sites had room for 4-5 cars only, and there was always availability.  I have visited US Nat'l Parks all of my life, but have never been to one where I heard the words, ""Oh My God!!!!!"" uttered so many times. Looking down into the canyon and seeing how time and erosion have shaped the rocks into pinacles of white, red, yellow, and other subtle colors, and watching those colors change as the sun light varied, was truly a spiritual experience.There were many visitors who hiked down INTO the rocky spires. There were also safe hiking trails above.  This park is right up there with my lists of ""must see"" places in the US, along with Grand Canyon and Yellowstone.  I'm not going to suggest to my children that some time in their life they should come to Bryce Canyon......I'm going to INSIST that they come!!","October 28, 2012",Spiritual Beauty,170,"New Hartford, NY",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This is one of the most fantastic natural wonders on this planet.If you have never heard of it don't be ashamed............neither had my wife or I before we visited!The Canyon is easy to get to by car although distances in this egion are significant. eg about 160 miles from the grand canyon north rim. Once there you pay $25 entrance and have the option of either parking your car at the visitor centre or taking a free shuttle to the many viewing sites.I would recommend that you view an excellent film about the making of the canyon which runs continually in the visitor centre before you venture further into the Canyon. Also plan your day in the visitor centre as there are rangers there to offer sensible advice and to inform you about the best view points or trails,.There is no doubt that the first four viewing sites from the visitor centre are the most spectaculat and I would hearily recommend the Queen's garden/Navajo loop combined trail as it is truly spectacular but only for the relatively fit.Another MUST is to stay until sunset as the colours intensify at that time and the Canyon becomes magical!Definitely go.............you won't regret it!","October 24, 2012",A true natural wonder.............should be better known!,15,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",5

The ""RIM WALK"" is easy walking for the 'older tourist' but gives great views. There are walkable trails DOWN into some of the canyons for the younger and energetic hiker.

This observation area is pretty unshielded from the wind, so wear a coat! Later, we visited Sunrise point, where you are much closer to the structures but not viewing from as good an angle as inspiration point for the sunrise.The easy hike down gives you a completely different and more intense experience than you get from simply observing the Canyon from the rim - this is strongly recommended!","October 22, 2012",A breathtaking must see,26,"Lomma, Sweden",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This park turned out to be the highlight of our trip to Utah. We've been to many places with red rocks and a few places with hoodoos but this was the most impressive by far. The hoodoos are so numerous and the scale so vast. It is impressive from the rim but to really appreciate it you have to take a hike down into the canyon.We parked at the lot right inside the park and took the shuttle into the park the first day we were there when we were going to be hiking. That worked well for us so we didn't have to worry about finding parking at some of the more popular spots. Be aware however that the shuttle doesn't make all the stops going into the park. Since the canyon is on the left side they must not want people crossing the road. So most of the stops come after the shuttle has gone all the way to the end and is on its way back and can drop people on the ""correct"" side. We didn't find this a problem but some people might be frustrated.The visitor center was very busy and didn't have a lot of displays. They did have a nice film that we didn't see till near the end of our visit since we were so anxious to get to the canyon!","October 21, 2012",Absolutely Spectacular,137,"Springfield, IL",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I did not, but I saw them at Bryce. They are vertical rock formations formed by the freezing and thawing of water. They have 200 days a year when it both freezes and thaws. The only other place on earth like it is somewhere in Turkey. Bryce is technically not a canyon, because there is no river. We went to Bryce for the hiking. We went in the fall so as to avoid the summer crowds, but it turned out to be busy then too, with older people (like us) and foreigners. I didn't think it was too bad, and because we did some of the more difficult hikes, we saw fewer people. There is a shuttle system in the park, but you can also use your car if there is room in the parking lots. We had no problem with that and did both. The in-park lodge is very nice, but we were happy with our less-expensive accommodations at the nearby Bryce Canyon Pines. I would also recommend the free narrated bus tour, which we did the first day to get the lay of the land. You sign up at the Visitors Center. I thought this park was the more unique of the two we visited this trip (we also went to Zion). Pay attention to weather averages because it can be colder here because of the elevation (8,000 feet), also be aware that elevation can cause problems if you are not prepared for it. Most of the viewing of Bryce is from the rim, but you can hike down into the canyon as well. If you are a senior citizen you can buy a Golden Pass, giving you free entry to all national parks. I would also suggest spending several days here. We spent three days.","October 19, 2012",Do you know what hoodoos are?,97,"Clinton, NY",5

We then hiked back down Navajo Loop to the two bridges. This trail is well paved, but steep. Not for those that are not in good shape, but very worth doing.Attended the Astronomy program given on certain nights by the Park Rangers. This was wonderful! Ranger Sean Duffy is a great speaker and story teller, is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable, and clearly loves his job. Following the talk, there are telescopes set up behind the visitors center by volunteer, amateur astronomers for you to view different stars. We really enjoyed program, including my two teenagers.

Trails are well maintained. Each lookout is a little different throughout the Park and you will want to see them all as each has a little different view of the Canyon.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"What an awesome place. We visited a whole bunch of sites on our visit to Utah this summer but this place is the standout winner by some distance. Al the photos you have ever seen of this place do not approach the real thing. Yes, it is crowded but it is also easy to lose the people if you make the effort. Take one of the hikes either around the rim or down into the bottom (the Garden Trail / Navajo Loop is always packed but it is pretty impressive). Do the Fairyland Loop if you can (clockwise from Fairyland Trailhead is best), it sounds a long way but the sights are sublime and the climbing back out isn't too bad - plus you can cut it short at Sunrise Point. Use the Shuttle to take you between places on the rim and you can stitch a few bits together without having to retrace your steps. Ride all the way out to Bryce Point and you can either hike back along the rim or go down to the Peek a Boo Loop and link up with the Navajo Trail into Wall Street - which by the way is a stunner, however you get to it. You can drive right down to the end of the park but you will need plenty of time and the main sights are largely in the Amphitheatre Area.

The park recommends a clockwise route, however, after speaking with several hikers, they recommended a counter-clockwise direction. This worked out much better for two reasons, starting early in the morning, the sun would be at our back for most of the hike. Secondly, this is a very crowded park and since most everyone starts at the other end, we had the most popular section of the trail (wallstreet) to ourselves. One of the coolest hikes I've ever done. Hard to describe and even capture in pictures, but I've attached one of the wallstreet section. Below me, but hard to make out, is a series of switchbacks that lead to the bottom of this canyon.

We arrived right before sunset, so we drove in to get a glimpse and try to catch the sunset. The weather was not on our side and didn't get to see a sunset, but it didn't matter because our jaws were on the ground at the hoodoos. The fogged rolled in and the sky was dark, but still amazing! We didn't get a sunrise either and it rained almost the entire day we were there. Usually rain would ruin a vacation, but it didn't matter here because every view is spectacular and it didn't get us down. We stopped at Ruby's to buy a rain poncho, but I highly recommend packing your own rain gear if it's in the forecast because the quality of the cheap ones is not that great and I tore it half way through the day. The park is so clean and makes it so easy to use your own car. You never have to walk too far if you don't want. The newsletter we got at the park entrance was really helpful, but they should highlight Bryce Point more in it because we almost missed walking out all the way to the overlook which was breathtaking. Don't miss it (it's on the left side of the parking lot. We would have loved to do some of the rim walks if the weather was better. One benefit to taking the shuttles would be doing the rim walks because then you don't have to double back. We had no intention of hiking at all, but the rain slowed down and we hiked down the Navajo Loop Trail at Sunset Point into the slot canyon. It was amazing! Plan to do one hike to go down into the canyon. Bring the right shoes and allow some time to walk around a bit if you are in good shape and can handle the steep trails. One thing I never saw on Trip Advisor or my travel book was anything about the altitude. It really bothered me and I had no appetite and a small headache. It started at the Grand Canyon, but was a lot worse here (as the elevation is higher.) I took an Advil and it helped, but if you have something specifically for altitude sickness bring it! Take it easy and drink LOTS of water. Although it's a bit out of the way if you are going between Zion and the Grand Canyon it is so worth it! You can easily do it in 2-3 hours, but try to spend the entire day. There is no place like this in the world!

Bryce Canyon is absolutely amazing ~ I love the colorful rock formations and hoodoos. My husband went on the Queens Garden trail and I wish I'd been feeling well enough to go. Yes, it was hot and we had thunderstorms both afternoons we were there, with hail, but it's worth waiting them out and then proceeding along the ridge road and viewpoints. We drove all the way up to Rainbow Point, walked the Bristlecone Trail, and then drove back down, stopping at most view areas. The view from Sunset Point is especially awesome. The exhibit and video in the visitor center are worth seeing as well. Great place. Just reading about it doesn't do the trick.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This was the reason I extended my stay one more day! We were at the visitor center by 5:55am and were the first in line. The next person to get there arrived about 15 minutes after us. I think most people went to see the sunrise first, then came over to stand in line. There were 2 hikes - one on a less strenuous trail than the other. We picked the Queen's Garden loop hike. We actually hiked the trail during the day so we familiarized ourselves with what to expect. That evening we met Ranger Don at the trail, and after a few formalities and discussions we set off. There was some lightning in the distance, but it didn't seem to be coming our way. Needless to say, with the clouds in the sky, the moon was hidden so it was pretty dark. The thunder and lightning seemed to be getting closer, but we kept going. About 3/4 of the way down, it started pouring rain! And I mean POURING! Thunder, lightning and rain in pitch black darkness on a steep trail makes for a scary adventure! Thank you to those who didn't listen to directions and brought flashlights!! Special thank you to the woman who stayed with us to help lead us out with her flashlight! It was difficult climbing uphill - fast - as the lightning kept getting closer and closer. I don't think I climbed a trail faster than I did that night! Of course, after what seemed to be an eternity of praying that you stay on the trail as you grope your way up and don't fall off the sides of the cliffs, we made it to the top. I did see the couple from Holland the next morning at sunrise at Bryce Point so I know they got out ok. But Katherine from L.A. - hope you got out ok too! The park should have an emergency plan for situations such as this to make sure that all 30 hikers got to safety. There was no one at the top to meet us, and everyone just got in their cars and eventually left. No one was there to account for all of the hikers, so I just hope everyone got out of there ok. Once to safety, it then became a great adventure instead of a scramble to get out alive!!! Maybe one day I'll be able to experience it for the amazing experience that it truly is meant to be. But I can also say I experienced the dangerous side of it!

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Having looked at some of the pictures of Bryce Canyon before our trip, I can't say that I was expecting very much. After all, I had already been to the Grand Canyon, Zion, and Arches national parks. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised. The geology and the natural beauty of Bryce Canyon was unlike anything I had ever seen. It exceeded my expectations in every way.In one day, we toured the park from tip to tip by car, taking advantage of a few relatively short hikes. The best hike was the Navajo Loop Trail, which is located at Sunset Point. It's fairly short at a little over a mile long, but it's pretty much straight down and straight up again. So, I wouldn't recommend it for people who are not accustomed to hiking or exercise. The best part of it is the perspective you gain from looking up at teh hoodoos and other stone formations, trees, etc. All of the roadside observation points look down at the formations. Looking up lends a whole different, almost other-worldly perspective. Truly amazing. I also recommend the trails out near the end of Rainbow Point, which provide some great views of the southern Utah landscape.The visitor center was informative and staffed by friendly, knowledgeable staff. You can easily spend a full day at this park. However, even if you only have a half day, you can still see most of the park via the roadway and stopping at most of the roadside viewing areas. This park is truly remarkable and a must-see for any tour of southwestern Utah.","September 5, 2012",Much more than I expected,130,"Portland, Connecticut",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"The view is unique, and is best enjoyed at sunset and sunrise. We reached late on 9/1 evening and enjoyed the sunset from a high point at the north rim right next to the north campground. There were some dark clouds towards the east and a rainbow above the canyon! We then drove to inspiration point after sunset and saw the moonrise and the stars. It was a full moon so we couldn't see as many stars that night, but the view was still worth it! Woke up early next morning to catch the sunrise at Bryce Point, and I would highly recommend it. Hiking down through the Navajo loop/Queens trail can be somewhat strenuous while returning, but is a must do for the views it offers.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"As a one off hit of wonder, this ranks as one of the best places in the world. We arrived at sunset, when it is at its second best, so we were immediately awed - and my breath really did stop.... The rocks are unearthly - in structure and light.Although the park as a whole is quite large, the key cauldron part is best suited to a single long day's hiking. However, the best activity is to arrive before dawn, pick a good spot, and watch the sun rise. Be warned though - it is very, very cold before dawn - definitely negative C, even in September. Of course, it then gets hot during the day. That's South West USA for you!If you are coming for photography, I would recommend two mornings to make sure you get good shots (i.e. arrive one evening, full day, then sunrise before leaving). If the light is right (and it certainly was when I was there) you can get some magical photos. Bring a tripod and a polariser (to make the rocks glow more and shine less) and walk down the paths a little to get some interesting angles. See some of my pics here: http://photos.yeldham.org/p551236365For the views, this is better than Zion, and one of the best in the world.","August 27, 2012",Did actually take my breath away,22,"St. Albans, United Kingdom",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"My wife & I were part of a family group of 8 adults touring national parks for a week in early August (HOT!). We changed hotels daily & drove 1200+ miles during the week..... Lots of astonishing canyons, valleys, & rocks! Did I say it was HOT?! Our favorite national park (among the Grand Canyon, Zion, Capitol Reef, Arches, & Canyonland) was Bryce, which we visited 8/6. We found the overviews from the rim to be awe-inspiring & surreal. The huge number of strange, tall, stratified rock formations known as ""hoodoos"" seemed to form their own mystical, other-worldly civilization; they reminded us of the unusual, towering spires of Antoni Gaudi's Cathedral of the Sacred Family in Barcelona, Spain. What made the hoodoos so different than the features in the other national parks' canyons? Unfortunately, we didn't have the time to ask that question of Rangers at the Visitors' Center. Instead, after entering the park we first drove to Inspiration Point. We then walked to the canyon's rim, where we barely recovered our socks after they were blown off by the sheer awesomeness - OK, a bit of hyperbole..... :)6 of our party of 8 then went on hikes down into the Canyon, but because of my physical limitations, my wife & I drove to Sunrise point & then strolled along the Canyon rim to Sunset point. What a lovely experience! Despite my shortness of breath, I couldn't resist walking down one hiking path to below the tops of some of the hoodoos; it was worth the struggle...... My walking stick & my wife's patience were invaluable. We then rejoined our group for a late lunch in one of the Park's delightful picnic groves (that included lots of shade, picnic tables, & bathrooms). If I could have spent more time at one of the National Parks we visited during our week-long trip, it would have been Bryce.","August 26, 2012","Awe-inspiring, mystical, surreal scenery that is arguably the best in the Southwest",287,"Fortson, GA",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Each national park has its own ""specialty""; for Bryce Canyon it is the hoodoos, the thousands of pillars created by the forces of nature. The hoodoos of Bryce are a bit different than those, for example, of Arches NP and they are the dominant features. You can stare at them for hours, singly or in groups, and imagine they are everything from dragons to soldiers to poodles! Even though the rangers suggest you take the shuttle bus to reduce crowds and pollution, note that the bus only covers the northern 1/3 of the park; you will still need your car to see the rest and it is worth taking the time to do it. Each overlook of the short (~18 mile) scenic route is different. If you decide to take the drive, take the advice of the park service and drive to Rainbow Point at the south end first and then see all the overlooks on the way back. All of the stops will be on your right side and it is a lot safer to do it this way.","August 26, 2012",Let the thousands of hoodoos inspire your imagination with their multitude of shapes and forms,359,"Madison, South Dakota",5

The snow was off the trails, but there was snow left on some hills so we were able to hike up and slide down using a raincoat as a sled. Ruby's Inn is not much in terms of a town and the food in there (we had lunch) was nothing special, so if you are going to also do Zion, I suggest making Bryce a day trip.

We reserved a site far in advance, and upon arriving late in the evening we were pleased that our site was in fact already marked with our name and waiting for us (the campground was otherwise full). We stayed in the middle of a loop and had tons of space around our site, and it was really nice to enjoy cool temperatures at night, in July, due to the altitude. There were showers at the general store in the park, which were adequate, and nice bathrooms in the campground. Overall it was very quiet. Bryce canyon itself was beautiful. We felt that our one day was enough to get a feel for the park as we hiked the most common trails, but we could have spent a second day hiking a longer trail such as the fairyland loop so two full days of hiking would be good to plan on if you like to walk.","August 23, 2012",Bryce Canyon campgrounds are lovely,53,"Vienna, Virginia, United States",5

I suggest going to the end of the scenic drive and stopping at all the view points on the way back down (all will be on the right side of the road - this way). It is best to time your viewing of the Bryce Amphitheater between tour buses. Don't worry if you arrive at the same time as a tour bus, because they will take a quick picture and be gone.

One tip, which I found here on trip advisor, is to drive from the end to the beginning. The scenic turnouts are on the left side (coming from the entrance), so it was much easier to drive all the way to the end and having the scenic turnouts on the right side instead. The views are most definitely worth the drive, if you are staying at or heading to Zion.

My only gripe is that most of the viewpoints have very limited parking available, and it took multiple attempts before we could clinch a spot at the most popular sites. Large ravens reign over the canyons and amble around your picnic table and pose cooperatively for portraits atop the wood-and-stone posts at the view points. This is a high-altitude park (8000-9000 feet?), so drink lots of water, wear a hat in the sun, and take your time climbing from Point A to Point B. The sky is extremely blue on a clear, sunny day. I actually had a brief and startling nosebleed - most likely due to the altitude. It can be hot during the daytime and freezing cold at night.

It was well worth it. Though they cater to huge crowds of 60 or so, the cowboys break everybody up into groups of 10 and assign each group a guide. I was aware of some other groups while on the trail, but it wasn't distracting. The key thing is to get well below the rim of the canyon. Things look very different from down there.

We had our own food and didn't spend the night nearby, so we can't rate anything other than the scenic beauty. Inspiration Point and around that general area was our favorite place to visit.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"What else can you say about this National Park that has not been said on this site. The views are breath-taking and the Hoo Doos at sunset are just unreal! Maybe the best feature of this Park is the stars at night. Bryce is one of the darkest spots in the United States and the sky is amazing at night! We only had one day, unfortunately, so my advice is that if you have one day, visit Bryce Point, Inspiration Point, Sunset and Sunrise Points. You will see most of the great geological formations in these areas and there are some short hikes you can take down into the Amphitheatre and other areas. they are all within 10 minutes of the park entrance. I wouldn't bother with the shuttle for one day. I know the NPS will not want to hear that, but we had no problem parking on a busy weekday. You can take a break for lunch right outside the park entrance as there are plenty of places to eat lunch. And if you are driving up from Zion, don't miss Red canyon in Dixie National Forest (great pictures).

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited Bryce the first time based on a recommendation by a friend at church. When I told him we were taking a road trip out west to celebrate my oldest son's graduation, he said we definitely needed to visit Bryce Canyon.I am so glad he suggested Bryce. It is one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. I've never seent anything like the hoodoos; they are like castle spires. The arches and other rock formations created by the weathering of wind, rain, and snow are such lovely works of art. I don't know how a person could visit a place like Bryce Canyon and not believe in a Creator!I agree with my friend. If you travel west and visit Utah, you must absolutely see this place. We went in 2005 and again in 2007 because once was not enough. The day in 2005 was sunny, bright, and beautiful, but in 2007 we had a thunderstorm at the top of the park. The view was really amazing, even with the storm. There was a shelter you could stand in and still see the scenery.The only negative about Utah was that it had some of the highest gas prices - even higher than most of California - but that was in 2005 and 2007. I think the prices are really high everywhere now. No more road trips for this lady for the time being.","July 28, 2012",Worth a Second Look,29,"Allentown, PA",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Having already visited Death Valley, Grand Canyon, Lake Powell etc we were prepared to be underwhelmed by a more minor National Park. How wrong we were - it was amazing - the colours, rock formations and sights were brilliant. Prior to entering the Park you pass through Red Canyon - another pocket of visually stunning scenery. We loved our visit to Bryce Canyon and would recommend it wholeheartedly.We bought an America Beautiful card - it cost $80 but this entitles you to a years free entry to all National Parks (not regional/state parks) and recreational areas. As we visited several places during our travels we saved about $100 by making this purchase.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"One of Bryce Canyon's offerings is a superb astonomy show and star gazing experience offered three nights a week at the park. Last week on the evening that we were in the park, we were able to choose between two astronomy multimedia presentations. We attended the lecture on how scientists are able to measure the distances between stars. The presentation was fun AND scientific....very well done. Then we went over to the visitor center where there were four telescopes set up and manned by rangers and volunteers...all very proficient in astronomy. We saw Saturn with two moons, Mars, The North Star(s)...never realized the North Star was actually a dual star! Once everyone had seen these things...the rangers started focusing on other things...a nebula, a dual galaxy, star clusters. I asked one ranger how late they stayed...he said they stay as late as people are interested...most nights they were done about midnight.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon National Park with its incredible hoodoos and formations is a popular park that should not be missed. We didn't have very much time and debated whether to see Zion or Bryce... in the end, we saw both. They are very different and each is spectacular in their own way.They encourage you to use their shuttle system but it is not mandatory like it is for the Canyon Drive at Zion. We did not use it nor did we really see it. It doesn't run as frequently so bear that in mind when you plan your trip. Bryce is also cooler than Zion because of the elevation (over 9000' at Rainbow and Yovimpa Points).When you drive into the park, the view along the road doesn't look particularly impressive. That's because you have to see the canyon to see the hoodoo formations. We drove all the way to the end to Rainbow Point and started our tour there since all viewpoints are on the left side of the road going in but are on the right side going back out. There are signs noting each viewpoint which include the elevation. Usually it is just a short walk (or no walk) to see the view. I thought the most impressive view was of Bryce Amphitheater from Bryce Point. Four viewpoints overlook this large collection of HooDoos. If you visit the park the way we did, this area will be one of your last stops since it is close to the entrance and Visitor's Center. That way, we could build up to it. After seeing it, the other stops wouldn't have been so impressive! If you are short on time, concentrate on that area of the park. We did not take a hike, but the easiest hike is Queen's Garden. Mossy Cave hike includes a small waterfall. Bryce Canyon has a night-sky program.

Bryce Canyon National Park,Bryce is not really a canyon because it was not formed by flowing water but instead by freeze and thaw cycles. You should know to pack very warm clothing because it is cold at night. The sky is spectacular and if you can attend a sky party at the visitor center. The dark rangers are wonderful at their astronomy and the traditional native American stories about the constellations. It was very dusty during the day and hot hiking because you are hiking on solid rock on the formations. It is a beautiful park and were are very happy we saw it.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Like almost every review says, the views of Bryce Canyon a truly otherworldly and spectacular. Compared to nearby Grand Canyon, it's quite different and not on the same size scale -- but this works to your advantage in summers when pollution and forest fires in neighboring states fill the air with particles that make views at the Grand Canyon hazy and washed out, which is NOT the case at Bryce Canyon.You can view the main Bryce amphitheater from a number of vantage points along the rim -- accessible by walking the rim trail, by car, or by free shuttle bus -- and get amazing views. Early morning and late afternoon are the best times for viewing, because the low angle of sunlight makes the red rocks glow even brighter and warmer than under mid-day sun -- but it's awe inspiring at any time. If you can stay in or near the park -- we stayed at the Bryce Canyon Lodge -- you can get out on one of the trails early in the day, taking advantage of the favorable light AND beating the often-intense mid-day heat. Also, as the summer goes on, many afternoons are punctuated with clouds and thunderstorms in July and August, so getting an early start is definitely in your best interest. (If you're planning for next year, then June is a great time to visit, because it's typically one of the driest months of the year; we didn't see a cloud from sun-up to sundown in our three days in the area.)If you're able to hike a few miles, the Queen's Garden/Navajo Loop trail (listed separately on TripAdvisor) leads you down into the canyon, where you can stare up and gawk at the impressive formations above you. The views from the canyon rim are impressive, but taking at least one hike down into the canyon and looking up is a MUST if you a physically able. We hiked down the Queen's Garden trail from Sunrise Point, took the connector trail to the Navajo Loop trail, and ascended through the stunning narrow canyon called Wall Street to exit at Sunset Point, a half mile along the rim from where we began. Do it if you can. Be sure to carry enough water for everyone in your group; if possible, get an early start to beat the heat, get the good sun angle, and perhaps most importantly, beat the crowds, which build as the day goes on. (The first two-thirds of our hike we passed people every now and then, nodding a warm smile as we shared the canyon; at the end, ascending through Wall Street, we were met with hundreds of fellow tourists, tour bus-loads, which gave the trail an entirely different feel.)There is often a national park service ranger-led walk-and-talk along the level half-mile rim tails from Sunset to Sunrise Points at about 5 p.m.; we found this hour walk interesting, as the ranger talked about the geology as well as the vegetation, the animals, and the history at several stops along the short walk. Check at the Visitor Center or the Lodge for the time of this free ranger talk; it makes for a good introduction to the park.Here's my tip which I haven't seen written up much: Another free service the National Park Service provides is a guided bus tour twice a day through the entire scenic drive portion of the park beyond the main Bryce Amphitheater. Many people either see only the viewpoints in the Amphitheater, or they drive their own way down the scenic drive, popping out at each of the half-dozen or so viewpoints. the advantage of this bus tour is that you don't have to do the drive yourself, and you get a guide who can point out many things you'd likely miss on your own. Since the bus (a comfortable, air-conditioned touring bus, not one of the smaller buses they use for the shuttle service in the northern end of the park) is run by a concessionaire, not the park service itself, I have no idea why there is no fee for this 3+ hour trip, but it's a true bargain if you can fit it into your schedule. There are only two trips a day -- so no more than 80 people a day get to take advantage of this service. We did a nice hike in the morning, had lunch at the Lodge, and then took the afternoon bus tour, to make a great day. You MUST sign up for this bus tour in advance. When we were there, we were able to sign up just two hours before the afternoon tour, but book it in the morning or the day before (if they let you?) if you know you want to do it, especially in the peak of tourist season. You make a reservation by using a phone at the Visitor Center (on the left side of the ranger information desk), or they can probably connect you to the shuttle desk from the Lodge.","June 25, 2012","Spectacular views, great short hikes",175,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Hm, where to start - it's kind of hard to do Bryce Canyon justice. Words and not even photographs are enough really. Even if there actually are people who are unimpressed by it - hardly anybody, but still - I'd have said Bryce Canyon is one of the most stupendous and breath-taking, mind-boggling places. We don’t know if Alice ever did go down that rabbit hole or though the looking-glass, or if Dorothy really ended up in Oz, but if you go to Bryce Canyon you’ll feel (or at least 99.9% of you will feel) you’ve finally found a fairytale wonderland. It’ll be unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. Do NOT expect the overwhelming dimensions of the Grand Canyon or the imposing towering mountains and canyon walls of Zion, or the vast and endless sheer-eternity of Canyonlands – no, Bryce is on a more comprehensible scale; it’s a Faberge egg or a cameo (in reverse – which would make it a taglio) among massive artifacts, but a scintillating jewel in the Southwest’s sparkling crown of priceless gems that is the Grand Circle.Anyway, Bryce Canyon national park is quite large, but what most people want to see more or less exclusively is the ‘Amphitheater’ – the large ‘bowl’ in which the powers of erosion – be that heat and cold, water and wind, combined with time – have worked. You’ll see an amazing maze of spires and turrets, columns and pillars and walls and fins of frilly statuesque rock pinnacles with its windows and arches and balanced heads, the cracks and gaps and slots and crags - rock formations that tickle your imagination and fancy, fins and walls like organ pipes in scurrilous twirls and squiggles, curlicues and scrolls in a flourish of enticing pastel shades of rose, pink, cream, off-white and reddish brown to salmon-red in horizontal sections, displaying the different layers that once formed an unbroken surface. It’s a whole region of nature’s Disneyland Castle. Viewed at sundown or sunrise, you’re treated to a Sensaround Technicolor display of magical dimensions. When you visit take the time to hike at least a short way into the bowl, even though the different viewpoints positioned around the edge like frogs around a pond are spectacular in their own right. But descending down up close and personal among the hoodoos is a special experience – and you don’t even have to go far. Bryce is indeed a place not to be missed!","June 19, 2012",Fairytale land of hoodoos and fins,716,"Wickenburg, Arizona",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We decided to follow the advise from many on tripadvisor contributors and follow scenic hwy 12 in Utah. IF you have already travel through Zion and Bryce I would let this 4 hour trek go, unless you are headed to Moab. It was a long and tedious and winding road that was not worth it if you are headed north, just take 15 and GO. I was disappointed and wish I had not wasted the time.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Pros - A one of a kind place full of ""wow factor"" around every corner. I have been to plenty of National parks and this one rates up there with Yellowstone! It is well laid out, easy to access and it was (when we went end of May) not crowded. We went on the ""figure eight"" loop which incorporated ""Queen's garden"" ""Peek-a-boo"" and back up the ""Navajo Loop"" (I think about 7 miles?) Arguable one of the best hikes I have ever taken! A totally different experience than from above. Above has it's own awesomeness though and ALL can be done via a great shuttle service. This is a park that can be done in a few hours or a few days...I can't say enough about it...the pictures don't do it justice. If you are there on a clear night DO NOT miss the night sky and/or the sunrise...sunset was a bit anti-climactic. Cons- If you are going to do the hike...prepare for a lot of hill climbing!!! It is spectacular but the experience is up and down and up and down. TOTALLY worth it but there was a lot of puffing and panting along the way. Bring TONS of water...you'll need it. Start early in the morn and try and be finished before the heat of the day. The only other con is that is was so spectacular hiking it we felt everything else was hard to measure up.","June 12, 2012",Spectacular - Pros and cons,156,"Olympia, Washington",5

Everything that I read said that the Queen's Garden/Navajo Loop was the best hike. The employee at the visitor center told me that the best hike was the figure 8, which included Queen's Garden, Navajo Loop, and the Peekaboo Loop, as did another visitor. The Peekaboo Loop added about 3.5 very strenuous miles, but it was so worth it. I've never seen anything like it. The Queen's Garden Loop and Navajo Loop were pretty busy, but the Peekaboo Loop was not. There were times that I felt I was the only person in the world. The viewpoints are amazing, especially at sunrise and sunset, which were both magical. The night sky is also beautiful.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We were amazed at how beautifully unique Bryce Canyon was. Unfortunately, we were there in mid-May during a wind storm (40 mph winds) so there was sand pelting us during most of our visit. It was so cool that we needed sweatshirt and jeans. We hiked the Navajo/Queens Garden Loop, which was a great hike, and drove to various scenic lookouts. Bryce is 100% worth seeing; however, I wish we had not planned to spend the night in the area. The park can really be a day trip from somewhere else. We saw pretty much everything we wanted to see (including took a hike) in about 6 hours. There is really nothing to do in the area other than the park so it was a waste of our time to spend the night there.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"During our trip we visited Zion National Park, North Rim Grand Canyon but Bryce Canyon was the most visually interesting. I definitely recommend stopping at points along the 18 mile scenic road. Some of the points require a bit of walking while others are right in front of you. The views of the Hoodoo's & surrounding canyon are amazing! These are views you will never see anywhere else. I suggest driving to the last point-Rainbow-& start there. This will give you less traffic to deal with & all the points are on that side of the road so easier access as well. The park has shuttles which take you to each point & they really push this mode of transportation to protect the park. The only problem is the shuttle starts 8am & stops at 7pm. We drove because we started our hike early morning & we stayed in the park for sunset during our drive of the scenic tour. We viewed the sunset from Inspiration Point & it was gorgeous. You will not only have great views of the canyon but may also see wild-life on your drive. The entrance fee to the park is $25 & open 24 hours a day.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"When the mormon Ebenezer Bryce first saw the place in 1874 he was supposed to have said "" Hell of a place to lose a cow "" Well its not my first thought but you can kinda see what he meant. We have visited Bryce Canyon twice and both times were in awe of the natural beauty that has been created by the power of nature. The colour of the hoodoos and cliffs vary in colour from pink, red, orange, yellow and blue. The scenic park loop road gives you many opportunities to see the weird shapes but park up and take a short stroll and the views get even better. Make sure you pick up a map from the entrance point or visitor center. We stayed at the lodge which was super for evening strolls when all the crowds had departed. We also did the moonlight walk down into the canyon, awesome.

However, by the time we got to Bryce Point, the sheer number of hoodoos became overwhelming and we started to lose interest. We were barely inspired by Inspiration Point and actually gave Sunset and Sunrise Points a miss. What a crazy thing for avid photographers to do when we actually had the opportunity to visit at sunset and sunrise!

We liked sunrise better with the sun starting to shine on the amphitheater. We took part in a ranger talk at 11:30. It wasn't in a shaded area at Sunset point and ended up going 45 min instead of 30 and our whole party got sunburned. We weren't sure where the talk was going to take place and we weren't prepared for the sun. We were also there for the astronomy weekend and they had 50 telescopes we could look through to see stars, etc. It was very cool! I would highly recommend visiting during an astronomy event. There were so many stars in the sky even without looking through a telescope. We also saw the solar eclipse, but stayed at our camp site at Ruby's Inn for a great view thanks to the special glasses the national park passed out.

It is moderate to strenuous towards the end, but there is so much to see that you will stop lots of times for photos along the way. These little stops help break up the climb. Make sure you take water and wear sunscreen. Hats and sunglasses are also important. And be sure to wear hiking shoes or boots.

And they don't stop at each stop in direction they are going. I am in my sixties and out of shape but was able to complete the hike from Bryce Point to Inspiration Point. (Both shuttle stops.) It’s about 2 miles, a dirt path, up and down, and some “edge of the canyon” portions which were kind of scary for me, with my fear of heights. Took me about an hour and a half. But once completed, I was exhilarated. Best memory of my trip. Terrific views and formations not seen from shuttle stops. Bring lots of water on hikes.

For as far as your eye can see there are thousands and thousands of inticately sculped columns of beautiful shades of red rock. Nature did it over thousands of years through the only tools it has: water, wind, gravity, internal upheavals in the earth. Unplanned, and blueprinted beforehand, the results couldn't be more spectacular.I've seen beautiful columns crafted by men thousands of years ago in Egypt, Greece, Rome. But none can match these unplanned, natuallly evolving columns for shear beauty, grace, and, yes, even inspiration! (Sometimes you can even take a helicopter rider over the canyon. Expensive, but unforgettable.)It's worth a trip to southern Utah just to see this one attractions; but it's one of many various types of nature's red-rock masterpieces.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"As a photographer, I've been looking at pictures of Bryce Canyon at sunrise and wishing I could see it for myself. I've been hesitant to go, however, because I though it would be a one-dimensional park - that is, take in the site of the hoodoos and be gone. Well, I finally did and couldn't have been more wrong. Those who drive up to the 6 or so lookout points aren't disappointed - it's a stunning, one-of-a-kind spot. But what I discovered was that the magic of this place is in the hikes into the canyon itself. Every turn reveals a landscape unlike anything you've ever experienced. We saw blue jays, woodpeckers, birds I don't even know the names of. It was fantastic and the picture were great. Only disappointment was that we (my son and I) wanted to take pictures of Bryce's famous nighttime sky (it's purportedly one of the darkest spots in the country to star gaze) - and found clouds instead. So if you do stay there, and you're into that kind of thing, definitely book two nights or more so that you have a better chance to get what you came for.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Just got back from our trip which started in Vegas and included four National Parks - Zion, Bryce, Grand Canyon & Death Valley. Each was special in it's own unique way. I was curious to see the annual visitation to each of the parks. Of course Grand Canyon was 1st with about 4.3 million visitors. 2nd was Zion with 2.8 million, 3rd was Bryce with 1.3 million and Death Valley almost 1 million.This really surprised me. Bryce is a very short drive from Zion. It is well worth the 2 hour drive from Zion. If you are going to Zion, you have to go to Bryce. This place is so beautiful. Very accessible park. Most of the major sights can be viewed from your car or a very short walk. My favorite spots were Natural Bridge, Sunrise / Sunset Point and Inspiration Point. Take the Queens Garden trail, at least for a short distance. You don't even have to go the full distance, go down as far as you are able to.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"I visited the quite wonderful Bryce Canyon NP for one day (plus the evening before, quickly explained below) as part of my month-long tour of the Utah/Arizona natural attractions last year. It was the second time I had been there, the previous time some 25 years earlier when things were MUCH quieter ! I have also posted a separate review for the individual trail I did.Bryce is an absolute gem of a NP which I found to be MUCH more enjoyable on my 2nd visit. It is justifiably popular (especially as it is nearest to the phenomenally busy Zion NP) so it can get busy, but as the region is quite large it is possible to get a bit of isolation. To put things in perspective though, whilst it may get busy at 'peak' times the numbers are rarely more than HALF of those for Zion; due to the different climate at Bryce, the winter numbers are usually around 1/4 of those for Zion....I have compiled an extensive Trip Advisor 'Trip List' for my tour, which includes 'extra' attractions and also has links to the other individual TA reviews I've contributed for the accommodation/attractions I visited - it has been made a Trip Advisor 'Itinerary'; I hope it is of interest and use to you - I plan to add visitor information sections/viewable media sections..... The most direct way to access it is by clicking my review-count below my profile name to the left of this review text. Alternatively, see after my review below the dashed line... You can also access my other Bryce review that way...Like Zion, Bryce now has a shuttle bus system with two BIG differences. Firstly, it is not mandatory so you can still drive along the main scenic road which leads to the second difference, in that the shuttle route does not include ALL of that scenic road - it has various stops but essentially serves the main/most popular 'Amphitheatre' area of the park.That is not to say that you are therefore forced to use your own vehicle to see everything - there is a free half-day bus tour operated by the NP authorities BUT it doesn't really get the promotion it deserves. Use that tour to save you the drive - it takes you the full length of the scenic road, with regular stops, only missing out the 'Fairyland Point' viewpoint area (near the entrance) as a stop.I THOROUGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FREE BUS TOUR - See details below....I quickly went to the NP visitor Centre the afternoon before my full-day visit the next day and found about the shuttle then. I had gone that day before as I had just driven/visited the part of 'Red Canyon' on Highway 12 (see my review) so it was close by and I also wanted to do my memorabilia shopping then, so I could use the shuttle the next day without having to carry around extra 'luggage'.Whilst at the VC by chance I learned about the tour, so used their courtesy phone to contact the booking office which was located at the so-called 'Shuttle Staging Area'/car park (the other side of the road from the shops/hotels a little before you reach the entrance kiosk). The tour really needs to be pre-booked, so what I did was get myself on the 'am' tour which meant my day wasn't split into 3 (ie hiking/'pm' tour/hiking) and it also meant I was in much better control of making the departure time...The full info is on the the 'Park Shuttle' webpage of the NP website (Plan Your Visit-Directions-Park Shuttle) or use the direct link on my TL.The tour does pick-ups before the tour route proper, has regular stops, a driver commentary AND also goes further/to viewpoints the 'normal' shuttle doesn't - the end stop is the 'Rainbow and Yovimpa Points' viewing area, which you'll see is the furthest you can drive !Doing the tour left me the rest of the day to view/hike using the shuttle system, which included my suggested route of descending via the VERY steep 'Navajo Loop' from Sunset Pt then ascend to Sunrise Pt using the more sedate 'Queen's Garden' Trail; do this the other way around and you have a nightmare ascent on the 'Navajo Loop' instead ! Do remember that you can view trail details on the various Bryce NP maps which you should get when visiting but are are also online. Please see my TL for the relevant 'Visitor Information', which includes the Internet link to the specific NPS webpage where they 'live'. For my tour I had a hiking guide which I found useful to get an idea of the trail highlights and any pitfalls which might exist.This was the only NP I visited which had a thoroughly comprehensive trail guide (inside 'The Hoodoo' newspaper-style pamphlet, downloadable/offered free at the visitor centre) which provided the all-important ascent/descent side-views/details for each hike. Considering how steep the trails down into the main gorge are, it is an invaluable guide to helping you decide not only which trails to attempt but also in which direction to walk them ! If you've just come from Zion you'll be in for a bit of a shock as the surroundings are VERY different in nature at Bryce. For a start, you are at a starting altitude of some 8000ft (most of what you do goes down from that into the canyon of course), which is nearly 4000ft higher than Zion. So, snow/cold is more likely and even summer evenings can be chilly - when I left my motel in nearby Hatch at the start of my full-day I had to scrape ice off the car windows ! Things warned up significant during the day though !The general appearance is far more desert-like and of course the natural rock formations and colours are DRAMATICALLY different. The rock formations are grotesquely, but also beautifully, shaped - you rarely see grass and almost everything has a beautiful reddish tint.*** Early morning I might have been scraping ice off the car windows, BUT you need to be aware that the daytime temperatures in the warmer months can soar dramatically. If you're hiking trails then you MUST take water with you and some kind of sun protection !There are rarely views anything less than superb and the experiences you can have in the canyon amphitheatre 'basin' amongst the ground-level rocks, looking up the rock faces to the viewpoints/scenic road are often memorable. The viewpoints themselves offer excellent vistas of the amphitheatre as well as distant panoramas with mountains at the furthest reach.I found the scenic road-located viewpoints offered good views, but they can be a bit too massive to capture properly with a camera - your eyes will have no problems though ! I also think it's worth hiking at least some portions of the 'Rim Trail', as that is not too strenuous and is different as you're skirting the amphitheatre edge rather than going up/down it.Bryce Canyon NP is an essential visit and you can do/see a lot in even one day. You really have to go to Zion AND Bryce - easy to do as they're relatively close to each other; they are VERY different in every way, from their popularity to the climate and, of course, scenery. They complement each other very well as they are almost so diverse from each other, almost representing the two 'extremes' of the Utah scenery you can see - until you get to Canyonlands that is.....I will add any relevant photos/videos after this review is posted by TA.----------------------------As well as the method described near the start of this review my TA 'Trip List' can also be accessed from the 'Utah Itineraries' link on the right of the Utah Forum page.

Bryce is so different from Zion - a great study in geology, no doubt. We spent a full day hiking the canyon, visited Ruby's general store, and then headed out of town. We originally had planned to spend the night but canceled after the hike - we felt like we had done all there was to do in terms of hiking. I'm sure that is not true, there's always more, but if you only have a day - you can definitely see this park and feel like you can check it off your list. The hoodoos are amazing - especially on the canyon floor where people have built some sort of a mini-hoodoo village. My kids could have stayed there for HOURS.

Bryce Canyon National Park,I think I've been at Bryce Canyon NP more then 5 times now and keep coming back to enjoy the thrilling views. The colorful landscape changes from sunrise to sunset and take the effort to take the very doable hike from Sunset to Inspiration point (or if you want to have more convenience drive up to the Inspiration Point parking lot for just a little climb) The view will knock you out. Also the trails down into the canyon are impressive and some of them are not too long.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Incredible colors, geologic features you will see no where in the world. That is why you will see dozens of European & Asian countries represented to experience this God's gift to man! Whodo's, spires, pinnacles, fabulous hiking trails and more. Always take a huge shade hat, a big neck towel in the summer to wet and stay cool, plenty of water & energy snacks. A minimum of 24oz even in the winter and 48oz in summer. Always have anti-slip shoes, & it is highly recommended to have some great Liki Summit shock poles to take the stress off your knees & feet. They make the down hill and up hill, so, so easy on your body. Weather old or young you have to try great hiking poles if you are going to do a hike with 200' to 800' elevation changes like the ones in Bryce Canyon. I love those Austrian made poles which are around $100 at Sport's Chalet. They have the most shock which really helps pushing you up and down the Wall Street & the Queen's trail hikes. Without poles you better be young and in good shape. The weather was around 45*F which was fabulous for hiking. You never broke a sweat. I was there hiking a dozen trails year's ago in mid-August and it was around 100*F, and beastly hot to hike. I sure could of used my old US Army cool down kerchief's and wet towels. The sand stone just radiates the heat back in your face. A huge shade hat and tons of sun screen with save you from being burnt to a crisp which most of the novice hikers were every time I have been here. If you go that time of year start your hikes at sun up. The sun's rays are so intense. The elevation will get to you if you have breathing problems. It is over 7,000' to 9,000'. I did have problems sleeping at Ruby's Inn due to the elevation. Of all my hikes from Mittenvald Alp in Germany, to Switzerland and the forests of Yosemite & Sequoia California National Parks, I rate the geologic splendor of Bryce Canyon & Zion National Parks the two places you must visit before you die. If you just drive to the dozens of pull-off view points and take pictures, it is fabulous. If you are handicapped don't let this hiking turn you down. There are great ramp areas to see. If you have breathing problems, just take your portable concentrator, which I saw several. I took my Albutoral and it was fine. The roads are excellent with speeds to 65mph. The only slow and low area is the narrow Zion tunnel which they had to make one way for some big motor homes when I was coming back. On this tour from Las Vegas you get to see Zion too which has a nice shuttle bus and a handicap trail. Just do it! If you have only one place to see in the entire USA, go to the combo-Zion & Bryce Canyon National Parks. Go on-line and you will see if it is for you. I have been there three times in my 50yrs of traveling all over the world and I still come back to get close to nature and the incredible fresh air of Southern Utah.","April 8, 2012","ONCE IN A LIFE TIME VISTA VIEWS, IT MAKES THE GRAND CANYON LOOK LIKE A SINK HOLE!",186,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5

All the different colors, all the sculptures you can see in the stones / the walls ...... it's a very unique place.Too bad the 'park busses' take you just to the first part of this beautiful park, but perhaps that will change in the future.We also did a hike into the canyon and enjoyed it very, very much.Bryce Canyon: a place you 'must have' on your to-do-list.","November 1, 2011",Bryce Canyon: a unique national park,35,"Amersfoort, The Netherlands",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We had an great time during our visit to Bryce Canyon National Park. The morning we arrived supplied the area with some fresh snow which made for some amazing views against the vivid red, yellow, green colors for the canyon. We spotted several mule deer which are prevalent in the park.","October 31, 2011",A winter fantasy at Bryce Canyon,19,,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Now let’s face it the Grand Canyon is pretty amazing, but be prepared for something pretty spectacular when you get to Bryce Canyon.I have skirted around the canyon for the last 20 or so years but never made it actually to the rim! Never knew what I was missing. Finally I got there and I was blown away by the place. The hoodoos in the amphitheatre, and all the rock formations though out the park were totally not what I was expecting. This place has to be on everyone’s stop list if you are in the area. It’s amazing! I couldn’t stop taking photos, think I turned Japanese! The park itself is one long dead end road and as we were there just after a major holiday it was very quite. Best to drive all the way to the end and stop at the lookouts on the way back. All the lookouts are amazing but the Sunset, Sunrise, Inspiration and Bryce points are the best, and if you can see them at sunset or sunrise even better. But all other lookouts are not worth missing, natural bridge included. We arrived late afternoon and it was raining, so we had a quick look at a couple of lookouts and got pretty wet, so decided to wait till morning as they forecast for good weather, and there was no sunset anyway. We woke in the morning at 6.00 am to a large blanket of fog. We waited and waited for the fog to clear and finally around 7.30am drove up to sunrise point, we missed the sunrise and the weather at the point was clear, a couple of pro photographers were there and said the fog lifted early at and they had the perfect sunrise on the hoodoos, and we had missed it, I was really disappointed. But still got some great photos. So if it’s foggy in Bryce city go anyway just in case. You do have to walk a little to get the best view; my aunty couldn’t walk to the best spot so she really did miss the best view of the Hoodoos. Its only 300 or 400 meters and I was out of breath walking back, but I am not the fittest person. I would love to do one of the rim walks, although I am scared of heights, I went for a short walk on the rim loop and it wasn’t too bad. But not enough time this trip to do that. You really need to stay minimum 2 nights or more. Ours was a 2 day, one night trip from Vegas, an easy 5 to 6 hour drive with stops in Zion National Park and Red Canyon on the way. You have two ways to get to Bryce but the trip though Zion is the most scenic, and no further out of the way than going through Cedar City. We left 40 degrees in Vegas behind us and ended up in Bryce city at a very cool 18 degrees and down to 8 overnight. We drove around to Tropic looking for a place to stay but it seemed a little too far for a one night trip, would have been perfect if we were there for couple of days or week or so. We did find a great diner in Tropic in the little store and had some delicious Mexican food, but as always couldn’t finish it, the meals are so big in America. We stayed at Ruby’s in Bryce City, not many other choices, the other big chain (best Western I think) was booked out and the two smaller hotels further back from the park entrance were very average. Ruby’s was OK, rooms were clean and tidy but expensive, about $130.00 a night room only, and free wifi. We couldn’t get into the diner for dinner or breakfast the queues were too long. There was a 30 minute or more wait. So we ate at the take out diner, wish we hadn’t, there was no other choices. Coffee was disgusting and $4.00 for a tiny mini croissant was pathetic. Lucky we had some fruit and nibbles we had bought with us on the trip, which got us through to lunch, which we ate at a pub in Zion on the way back, food here was great, and loads of choice. I would recommend booking ahead if your coming here in summer, and in winter, winter there is snow on the ground so its very cold! We didn’t think it would be hard to get a bed as it was the day after labour day and it wasn’t too bad, but we tried a few place before we tried Ruby’s but no luck, we paid up for not booking ahead.","October 30, 2011",Bryce Canyon better than the Grand canyon???,27,"Sydney, Australia",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"There are some hoodoos on the way to the park and on the way out - but the main canyon is an amazing site. You can combine the Queen and Navaho trails into a ~3 mile loop which lets you see everything. It's a pretty strenous climb out, but worth the effort. You can see the whole park in one day, with this hike and drive to all of the lookout points. There is also a flat rim trail if you aren't really into hiking. Note to photographers - Bryce Point is often noted as the best place for sunrise, but I arrived there to find two busloads of tourists at daybreak. Left immediately and went back to Inspiration Point and found 10 guys with tripods and plent of room to shoot.","October 28, 2011",One of a Kind,22,"Forest Hill, MD",5

The views from the overlooks are spectacular but to really appreciate the park you must hike down below the rim in amongst the hoodoos. The bad part is whatever goes down, must come back up! There are some trails with 20-30 switchbacks in order to ascend back up to the rim. But it’s all worth it (if you survive!). We also saw some pronghorn antelope grazing beside the road here.

We kept our things in the same shuttle and the guide explained everything before and while we disembarked at various points all around the park.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon is our favorite National Park in the lower 48. The uniqueness of the canyon/park is strickingly beautiful, but what I believe sets it a part from many other of the National Parks is it's intimate feel and relative ease of being able to explore the actual canyon. Don't get me wrong, you still have to be in decent shape, but some of the trails into the canyon (Navajo Loop) are relatively short and don't have terribly huge swings in elevation change (under 1000 feet). My seven year old was able to manage just fine as long as you bring plenty of water and snacks. Other things to do if you are staying for a day or so, try out the Canyon Rim Trail donkey/horse tours, and for those of you who are hikers I recommend the Fairyland Loop. It's an 8 miler and far less crowded than the other trails, rated as strenuous, which I totally agree with.","September 29, 2011",Our favorite National Park,26,"New Egypt, New Jersey",5

The park rangers were incredibly friendly -- and the park is stunning. Its smaller size makes it more explorable than some national parks, and since we went in the fall, it wasn't as crowded as other times of year, likely. Because of the extreme rudeness at a couple of hotels and restaurants in the area, who apparently don't appreciate the business of tourists, I would recommend either making this a day trip or only visiting well-reviewed sites in the area. However, if you appreciate amazing views and stunning geography, this park shouldn't be missed.","September 23, 2011",A phenomenal site,41,Nebraska,5

I took many photos, but I think the photos (and including other professional photos) just cannot capture the grand landscape of Bryce Canyon. It has to be experienced in person and I feel very lucky and privileged to have visited. In general, the National Parks we visited in Utah are the most spectacular I have seen - we have been to Zion, Bryce, Capital Reef, Arches, Snow Canyon.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon, although incorrectly named, is probably the least know NP in the US. And that's a good thing! That means you can go with your family and not be overwhelmed by the crowds at Grand Canyon or Yellowstone. The best part of this NP is the fact that it is extremely unique. Although not as, well, Grand as some of the others, pardon the pun, it is every bit as interesting with numerous vistas of unusual rock formations weathered by the elements. An unexpected treat for us hikers was the existence of several trails throughout the Park! While some are strenuous, there are many easy to moderate hikes that offer spectacular views from a lower perspective. There is good documentation at the Visitor's Center and I highly recommend a stop there first, although you well be tempted to continue to several of the viewpoints like Sunset, Sunrise, Inspiration, etc. Do yourself a favor and map out a plan when you get there. You'll find there is so much to see you'll run out of time if you only have a day.

This is a true gem left by Mother Nature.If you buy the National Parks Service Annual Pass it allows yourself and 3 other people into any park operated by them among other government agencies, all for $80 a year for the pass. It definately paid for itself for us. Purchase it from http://www.nps.gov/index.htm. Ruby's Inn offers a horseback ride through the Fairyland Loop, which unfortunately, I missed out on due to a hail storm that moved in just after we set up camp, and I made the mistake of booking us there for only one night. Don't worry, I'll be back to take that ride. We stayed just outside the entrance at Ruby's Inn RV park / campground. A definate 'recommend'. The staff of this complex is very friendly and professional. Even the housemaids of the attached hotel were cheerful, friendly and smiling, which is something you rarely see. We ate breakfast at the restaurant attached to the hotel lobby. The meals were very good and reasonably priced.

Take extra care to avoid deer at sunrise/sunset - they're everywhere. Don't feed animals - not even the cheeky chipmunks. There are many overlooks and some that may be wheelchair friendly; the outer points with rails are not. Short hikes are necessary for some of the overlook points.Plenty of food is available outside the park around Ruby's to bring in as a picnic, though the Canyon Lodge has a sit-down restaurant (under construction when we were there) and take-out is available as well.

But I recommend doing a hike into the canyon to truly experience it -- we did the Navajo trail. It's about a mile down and back and you get the fully canyon effect and you go through the hoodoos. One of the nice things about Bryce is that it's at elevation so it doesn't get nearly as hot as Zion National Park. We stated one night in a cabin here and enjoyed it. There is a general store and two eating options (diningr room and a pizza/pasta place).

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We are a couple of 60-somethings from Ontario, and after months of planning, took a 3 month motorhome trip to the US Southwest, visiting Bryce Canyon in late April. We opted to camp at Ruby's Inn and Campground - they accept reservations, and it was still very cold and we needed hookups. Ruby's was great, even accepting delivery of a package we had ordered to be sent there. In season there is a free shuttle bus from Ruby's to the park.First stop was the Bryce Canyon Visitor Centre, a treasure trove of enthusiastic, helpful rangers, valuable maps, presentations and useful advice and information about the scope and accessibilty of the trails, and the best times of day to trek and photograph each place. It really does matter. We wanted to see it all, but had to pick and choose what was best suited to our agenda and abilities - so we drove out to Rainbow Point at the end and spent the rest of that day overlooking and checking out each site along the way, taking short treks to those places we wouldn't visit later. Next day we trekked our chosen routes, making sure we spent time down at the bottom of the canyon, and despite having done lots of preliminary homework were constantly amazed by the sheer magnificence and absolute heartstopping grandeur we encountered, and which is why people visit Bryce. Packing proper hiking footwear, a wide-brimmed hat (we like Tilleys), good (wool) socks, and layerable jackets and shirts is a must! And of course a comfortable backpack to store it all in along with the camera, small binoculars, sunscreen, granola bars and at least 2 litres of water each. It may be tougher than it looks, and you may be tempted to overestimate your ability!Afterwards, being hot, tired, and sorely in need of a cold beer we visited the venerable Bryce Canyon Lodge - well worth a visit - only to learn that in Utah you can only be served alcohol with food. Hmm. Back to the RV and a couple of lawn chairs in the sun. Then back to the park again to see and photograph the sunset and the antelope grazing along the road. Having a National Parks pass really pays off, allowing unlimited entrance to the park(s) for the duration of the pass. (We have an annual one, it has paid for itself ten times over, from coast to coast).A pocket guide (such as the Lonely Planet guide to Bryce and Zion), is also helpful - read it beforehand and put post-its on those pages referring to places you plan to go. They make it easier to access the pages while scrambling up or down a canyon trail. Ours stayed in my hand along with the trail guide so I could refer to each site as we approached it. Perhaps the best aspect of Bryce (and the other Utah canyons too) for us as opposed to, say, the Grand Canyon is the ability to interact with it, to be up-close-and-personal. You can reach out and touch it all, not just gaze at it from a vast height. All in all, it is a 10 out of 10 sort of destination, and one not to be missed when visiting Utah, the Grand Canyon or the Southwest!","August 3, 2011",Bryce Canyon Exceeds all Expectations!,5,Great Lakes,5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce National park is one of 4 or 5 must see parks in Utah's rich Geographical parks. We have been to Zion and Arches National park. Bryce was our choice this year to explore. Utah does a great job with their park system making available free shuttles to take you from trails and scenic overlooks. Take advantage of the bus system, they show up every 10 or 15 minutes giving you adequate time to look at the landscape. The Hoodoo's are amazing and the color of this park is breath taking. My kids highlight was the trail down into the hoodoos at Sunset point. Not as bad as you might think, so go for it and go down and get up close. Really cool and believe it or not, not that bad coming back up it. Prices inside the general lodge for food and drink was actually really reasonable. The bus drivers are hit and miss on information. We had a lady who was extremely knowledgeable about the park, the trees and the ecosystem that we really liked riding her bus. Wish that all of the drivers were this in tune with their job and the park.","July 28, 2011",Cool Hoodoo's and hiking at Bryce Canyon,25,"Palm Coast, Florida",4
Bryce Canyon National Park,"I had a chance to visit Bryce Canyon National Park for only one day. I arrived around noon and left near sundown. It was an awesome experience. In spite of the short stay I had time to ride the shuttle bus to Bryce Point and then to Inspiration Point. From there I hiked the Rim Trail back to Sunrise and Sunset Point. Had lunch at the General Store, then hiked down the Navajo Loop through the Wall Street Slot Canyon. If you do not like heights then this trail can look intimidating but the reward at the bottom is worth it. Once you pass through the slot canyon keep going as the views are worth it. Just bring water and plan to stop and rest along the way. After hiking back out of the slot canyon I rode the shuttle back to Ruby's Inn and then drove my car all the way to Rainbow Point while it was still daylight. The view of the Grand Staircase is tremendous. On a clear day you can see all the way to the north rim of the Grand Canyon. By the time I was leaving the sun was going down and the wildlife was coming out to eat. Stopped several times to watch deer eat on the side of the road. I covered a lot of ground in only 8 hours. By the way, if you have Red Canyon on Hwy 12 going towards Panguich is worth a visit too.","July 23, 2011",A natural wonder,125,"Houston, Texas",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"I was floored by views in this place when we visited and they have stuck with me ever since. If you're in the region sightseeing at Zion National Park, Arches, or even the Grand Canyon, you need to add this place to your itinerary and truly do the Grand Staircase justice! The descent, walk through, and ascent out of the canyon along the main trail is not too strenuous (my girlfriend and I managed it in flip flops, although I wouldn't recommend that in hindsight), not too long (took about 1-1 1/2 hours, taking our time), and just plain fantastic. As an added plus if you're coming from Zion, you can take the scenic highway east out of the park and continue on your way toward Bryce.","July 12, 2011",Otherworldly and Spectacular,52,"New Orleans, Louisiana",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Bryce Canyon National Park is absolutely beautiful and accessible for all. We stayed in Panguitch in our RV for 2 weeks in June 2010 - part of the time hubby worked remotely but we had plenty of time to explore. You would miss a lot trying to do this park in a day. There are trails - at different levels of ability; horseback rides, bus tour, or just enjoying the views on the Rim trail. First the views are spectacular! The hoodoos are awesome and slowly changing. They change color at the different times of the day. We went in one morning close to sunrise to watch the the rocks awaken - some looked translucent in the dawn light. Bryce faces East and it is good to remember that Bryce is all about the light. We did take the 3+ hr bus tour down to the south end with Cliff on our first full day in the park. It is free and we enjoyed it. We might not have made it all the way down to Rainbow Point otherwise and Cliff was full of information - especially about Butch Cassidy who lived around in the area.Definitely go - but allow more than one day. We also went to Zion and the North rim of the Grand Canyon on this 7 week RV trip. All are different.","July 8, 2011",Amazing!,66,Texas,5

Of the two, I found that Zion had more variety in terms of hiking levels.My son and his dad hicked most of Watlers Wiggles and my 92 yr old mom walked on a flat trail. I did a somewhat verticle trail. All these are at Zion.Serious,serious hikers might enjoy Bryce. It is a site with the hodos. Really verticle.I was suprized in the past when others suggested Zion. Now I agree.We stayed in a hotel right at the gate of zion. My sister stayed in their condo accross the street. She had been there before and had scoped out where to stay. Both great stays.

With just a little snow in the shady areas of the canyon floor, the weather was ideal for hiking in uncrowded conditions. I will never forget the amazing rock formations and the beautiful colors. I think Bryce was my first experience of a national park, and I became an instant believer in the whole concept.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"We had planned this trip for a few months and found that it was well worth it. We drove from L A, CA and did the usual stops in Zion and Vegas. I have two friends that work inside Bryce so that made it even better since they know the place so well. My friend that works there came with me on the ""trail ride"" two hours of riding on the back of a mule or horse down to the bottom of the canyon and then back up! Some parts were kind of scary because the trail was so narrow but it was well worth it when you got to see the hoodoos up close and personal and did not have to do the hiking...the mules and horses did the work for you! The cost was not bad either at $50.00 a piece for the two hour ride. hint (go to the the restroom before going on the trail ride) no potty breaks on the ride!There is a ""day camp ground"" where you can build a camp fire and BBQ or just sit around the fire and talk which was really nice. We did that one day. We were the only ones who were there. We built up a fire in the fire ring and then brought a lot of snacks and drinks and talked about the trip and the Canyon! It was fun!I was able to take lots of amazing pictures on the Trail ride and have lots of great memories of this trip. I would recommend the trail ride for anyone who is not afraid of mules or horses it is well worth the price. The Trail boss was very nice and knew the history and actually had a great sense of humor. He nicknamed me California! I thought that was cute! We also hiked around the rim, hiked up to lookout point and hiked around the grounds and some of us hiked down to the bottom on foot. Going down is not bad but coming back up you may need to stop and relax or rest. A walking stick is very helpful. The camp market that they have in the park is great it has a litlle bit of everything you may need and the staff are very nice and helpful. The lodge is very nice and again the staff are VERY nice and helpful...I am not just saying that because I have friends there either. Everyone was nice and helpful.

We just couldn't get enough of the 'amphitheatre'!!! Every viewpoint gives a wonderfully different angle and coloring of the fascinating 'hoodoos.' We stopped at every single viewpoint on the brochure plus some others, picknicked at a table near the top of the park, and thoroughly enjoyed our day there. Because of arthritis we were not able to do any of the trails down into the 'canyon' but from above they look incredible and I so wish I could have done some.Make this a must do!","July 7, 2011",Unbelievably beautiful!!,16,"Chilliwack, Canada",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"While in Las Vegas for a conference, we rented a car from Hertz at Harrahs as we had t days left and went to Yellowstone in April and from there to Bryce Canyon and it was absolutely spectacular.

Words can not really describe the scenery.At the lodge there were busloads of Europeans, some east Europeans and also quite a few from the Scandinavian countries. They all raved about it.After that we went to Zion, another gorgeous place and then back to Las Vegas to return the car and fly home in the evening.The entrance fee is $25 per car but you can buy an annual pass for all National Parks in the US for $80 which we did and used it in Yellowstone and Zion also.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Since we're not up to strenuous hikes & since I'm a waterfall nut, we hiked up to Mossy Creek Falls. To reach the trailhead, you actually exit Bryce Canyon Park, turn right on Scenic Highway ?12 for a few miles. You have to watch closely for the turn off on the right heading east. There is a bathroom at the parking lot. The orange rock formations made it a beautiful hike; there were also some lovely little wildflowers blooming along the way. Because we'd reserved our spot on shuttle, didn't have time to take Left fork to Mossy Cave. This was the first day of the season shuttle buses were running [May 6]. When we reserved we had choice of weveral places for pick up, including the lodge, which we chose. Back in the main part of Bryce Canyon park, the shuttle bus driver/guide was very informative. The bus goes directly to south most stop, Rainbow Point. There were drifts of snow waist to chest high in the shady areas! The white snow, orange rock & green trees made a beautiful contrast. Ponderosa Point, Farview Point, & Fairyland Point were also nice.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Almost everything I want to say has already been said, it really is wonderful and almost indescribable.The first thing to understand is that it isn't a canyon in the Zion, Grand Canyon meaning of the word. As a visitor you arrive on the top of a messa and look down onto rock formations created by the weathering of many layers of rock. It is wonderful to hike down among these 'hoodoos', but if you are older, or physically challenged you will be able to view perfectly well from the paved rim walks at the overlooks. Make sure your camera has lots of memory, I took hundreds of pictures in a day.There is a good shuttle system that departs from Bryce Canyon City, so you don't really need to take your car into the park, just hop on and off. The regular shuttle is, however ,limited in the area it covers but if you have more than one day, or arrive early enough there are 2 trips each day that go an extra 16 miles into the park and allow you to see many more places that you would normally need to drive to.The spaces are limited to 54 on each trip, but you usually travel in a luxury coach and the best bit is that it is FREE.A tip for non American National Park visitors- the Americans probably already know -if like us you are on a road trip and visiting several National Parks check out the entrance fees before you go. If the total is more than $80 buy an annual pass, not only will you save money but the rangers at the gates give you a really nice welcome as they don't expect foreigners to be so involved with their Parks.","June 30, 2011",Beautiful Bryce,23,"Tonbridge, United Kingdom",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We were driving from Lake Powell and completely forgot that Utah is one hour ahead. After reading one of the reviews here, we had reserved space on the 1:30 rainbow tour with Spike. We raced against time and made it by the skin of our teeth.The tour turned out to be a total disappointment. Please do rainbow tour if you have absolutely nothing else to do. Even then, I suggest you drive to Rainbow point yourself otherwise you will be stuck with the tour for 3.5 hours like we did. There is no way to bail out.I would have preferred to spend that time hiking along the rim trail and admiring the amazing hoodoos from every angle. Go to Bryce Point, Inspiration point and spend as much time as you can. Walk along the rim and get a spectacular view of the entire amphitheater. We were spending the night there so we went there during the day, at sunset and at sunrise.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"While we only had a day to visit the park, it was well worth it. It costs $25 per car to enter the park for 7 days, or $30 for a yearlong pass. The crowds in the park when my wife and I went (June 2011) were very little, and it was so beautiful to see. Right after we entered we viewed the visitor center, which looked fairly new and had a wonderful exhibit as well. I recommend driving the park first, driving the 18 miles to the bottom of the park first and stopping on the way back North. The road in is only 2 lanes, and all of the sites are on the left - but this strategy avoids having to make left hand turns, saving yourself some potential accidents and avoiding traffic backups behind you. Resist the urge, the wait is worth it! Each of the 18 viewpoints are unique and memorable in their own right. You will be astounded by what you see. On a side note, a couple of the viewpoints have outhouses with stocked hand sanitizer, but the flush toilets at Sunset Point had flush bathrooms, with sinks and sanitizer, but no soap - very odd. I would bring a small bottle just in case they run out. Our only regret is that we did not do any of the hikes. We saw some children in flip-flops starting one of the strenuous hikes, as well as a lady in high heels - not kidding! I don't know how far they got on those switchbacks. But the hikes will be for next time!

I recommend commencing hiking between 11am-1pm, this will allow the sun to rise and the canyon to bask in natural light. Earlier, the canyon will be in shadows, and early morning fog/cloud may also be present. Later, you might end up hiking in darkness as the sun sets. The Queens Garden loop is fantastic and the best way to see the canyon. It provides vantage points you simply can't get from 'up top.' Its not arduous, and provides many picture taking opportunities (depart from Sunrise Point, then come back up through Wall Street to the Lodge - there is a bus which can transport you back to where you are parked).

Take your camera and some water and marvel at the beauty!","April 15, 2011",Stunning!,9,"Montague, NJ",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"I wasn't expecting such colour and beauty---multiple viewing sites, each on seemed better than the previous one---driving around, motels and parking facilities were quite quiet in September---highly recommended.","April 14, 2011",Don't pass up this trip.,44,Ontario,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,There are various viewing points within the park and there is a route planned out for you so you can drive from one to another. The canyon is at 8000 feet so your ears may pop and you may feel a little bit light headed. The views are spectacular and I took lots of pictures.,"April 12, 2011",Must see - different to the Grand Canyon,337,"Swadlincote, United Kingdom",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Not that I mind the cold. Not at all in fact - I'm from Buffalo originally. But be forewarned that the elevation change here is intense, especially as you venture further into the park. We read somewhere that it snows 280 days out of the year here. The park is amazing - we took a hike down through the hoodoos and went to lots of stops. When planning our trip I initially planned two days here, but after talking to people, they said you can easily spend one. I agree, this is a one day park. We stayed about 45 minutes away (although you could stay at Ruby's which is closer) but wanted to experience it at night, because it's one of the least light polluted areas in the country. That was a must see for anyone. Also, the park doesn't close at night, so we were alone, which was slightly terrifying considering all the wildlife warnings. We kept to the lookouts however. Great park. Also, potentially worth getting the national park pass if you're going to others.","April 1, 2011",Great - But Very Cold,154,Pittsburgh,4
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Our two-day trip to Bryce Canyon was well worth the long drive. The day we arrived, we were able to see every viewpoint from above the rim. My favorite was the last viewpoint, elevation 9,115 ft, around sunset (this is not Sunset Point). It was a spectacular sunset and we were all alone (of course this is March).The second day, we hiked the Queen's Garden/Navajo Loop trails and saw the canyon from the inside. This is the perfect trail because it includes, Queen Victoria, Thor's Hammer, Two Brides, and The Wall (which was closed but still semi-visible).The park was a bit expensive ($25) but the pass was valid for a week. We only stayed two days.My only regret was that Fairyland Loop was not accessible due to snow. The road was closed and I was not willing to snow shoe into the viewpoint.The canyon is very easy to access and March was the perfect time of year to capture the hoodoos with a little snow while still in temperatures from 45F to 55F. The park is open even after the gate closes which means you do not have to vacate the park at closing time (4:30 pm) during the winter months. Almost all of the services are closed during March so if you want to use the many services of the park - do not visit during March - wait until late April or May to go but you will have large crowds and no snow on the hoodoos.This is a MUST SEE park! Plan for two days (at least 1 full day and a half).","March 18, 2011",Absolutely Stunning!,208,"Key West, Florida",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Go in the winter, the snow on the rock formations makes it look like frosted ginger bread. Breathtaking! A caveat though, expect some trails to be closed in winter. If Bryce is part of a larger itinerary though, go for it!","March 8, 2011",Worth a winter visit for amazing snowy views,546,"Katonah, NY",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Jim, our ranger volunteer guide, accompanied us on a hike to the Queen's Garden feature of Bryce Canyon's amphitheater area. He entertained us with lots of interesting facts about the Canyon's geology, biology, wildlife, weather and hoodoos. We've taken many ranger-led hikes in our national parks and have always been fascinated by the wealth of knowledge these men and women have to impart. They embellish an already wonderful experience. Go National Parks ! And, thank you to the many fine folks who staff them.","February 14, 2011",take a ranger-led hike,1,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Both the visitors center and the general store were first rate. The Park is busy in the summer, but manageable. We hiked the Navajo loop and Peekaboo loop together. Unfortunately we didn't get underway until 9:30am, by the end of our hike it was over 100F by 1pm. We went through about 2 litres per person of water. I'd call this hike strenuous, at least for us. Would not have been as bad if not for the heat, but that was our fault. The scenery was amazing, just really unique, with the colours and shapes of the hoodoos. Don't be put off by the crowds, after 1/2 mile it really thins out. Definitely a worth while hike.","January 31, 2011",Very Scenic,115,"Sault Ste. Marie, Canada",4
Bryce Canyon National Park,"There are so many words to describe Bryce Canyon; beautiful, stunning, awesome, breathtaking, wow….etc. If it was not over a two thousand mile drive one way, we would go back again and again. I felt sorry for the tour groups that were dropped off by the big buses at the various observation points for a short look. While the views from the top were something to behold, the true beauty could only be experienced by hiking the various trails down into the canyon.Worth mentioning, there is a free shuttle service within the park that will take you from point to point. You can also drive you own personal vehicle within the park if you desire.You can/should stop at the visitors center for park information including maps of the park and hiking trails.I would recommend at least a full day for your visit. We had two and don't regret a minute.We liked everything about our time there and disliked nothing.Mike and Nancy","January 15, 2011",Even more beautiful than the Grand Canyon,29,"Lima, Oh",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,We drove from Zion Park to Bryce Canyon on December 28. It was a beautiful sunny day and the park was open. We walked the Queen/Navajo trail around the hoodoos. It was beautiful. One of the natural wonders..the formations are unreal and the canyon was well worth the visit. Initially we were worried as it has snowed a few days before but we lucked out with perfect weather to drive and walk around. I would positively recommend being well prepared for the cold weather in the season and we bought some snow grippers to put on our shoes from the Park store for $27 each. We didn't stop for lunch though some places were open. We preferred to drive back to Springdale and have lunch at Oscar's in Springdale.,"January 6, 2011",Amazing place - A cathedral made in stone!,246,"Toronto, Canada",5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We got up at about four in the morning, and started our journey from Las Vegas to Bryce Canyon National Park. Odds are, no matter where you are driving from, you will see your fair share of beautiful scenery along the way. The reason we chose this time of year to visit Bryce was so we could see the famous Utah snow draped atop the canyon. We made our way past Arizona, St. George (UT), and Zion National Park (visited Zion only two weeks ago) to one of the many entrances to the Dixie National Forest. The forest is home to some of the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen. Taking pictures a plenty, we would sooner or later get onto UT-89, and from there drive straight to Bryce Canyon. Because we were visited the park on Veteran's Day, the park was free of charge. It is usually $25.00, but it is most certainly worth it. The visitor's center holds an award-winning film that explains the history behind the canyon. Believe me when I say, that had my wife and myself not seen the film, we would have left the park later that day with more questions than answers. The film is free, so you might as well sit back and relax for twenty minutes, while you absorb the enigmatic background of Bryce Canyon. There are two different experiences you can take while driving through the park. A drive to Bryce Point and back is about four miles both ways. A drive to Rainbow Point and back (passing other major view points) is about seventeen miles both ways. When we got to Bryce Point, a Stellar's Jay (which we seen during the film) landed in a tree only about a couple of feet from where we were standing. We were able to get some really nice close-ups. We then walked the trail to one of the most scenic vistas anywhere, Bryce Point. I cannot even find words to explain it, other than unimaginable. At Bryce Point alone there are an incredible amount of different types of formations, but the biggest one is the amphitheater. Bryce Point is one of the highest points in the park at 8300 feet. Next, we continued to Paria View. Again, amazing formations mixed with a light snow made this the ultimate experience. We stopped by the Bryce Canyon Lodge which is currently packing everything up for the winter season. It will reopen in April. Not only was the scenery the most beautiful in our opinions, but the week before the lodge closes up is probably the most desolate time to visit the park. You pretty much have the park to yourselves. That doesn't happen during the Spring, Summer, and early Fall (especially May-August). We saw an abundance of Mule deer as well. Our last stop was Fairyland Canyon. This is where that famous scene of a balancing rock above all other formations can be seen in person. We liked everything about our trip to Bryce. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone. It doesn't matter whether you're an outdoor person or not, you absolutely have to see Bryce Canyon National Park!","November 12, 2010",Maybe The Most Unique National Park There Is!,196,"Las Vegas, NV",4
Bryce Canyon National Park,"I had already hiked some of Zion's trails before I got to Bryce. However, in Bryce you start at the top.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"Hiking into Bryce Canyon was a unforgettable experience. The vivid colors and beautiful shapes were like nothing I've ever experienced. We had a picnic in the bottom of the canyon ,just relaxing and taking in the sites. It was awsome. The hike itself was a little scary walking up the switchback trail to the top, but so worth it. I enjoyed it more than the Grand canyon. The pictures we took are breathtaking. So glad we made the trip.","November 2, 2010","Amazing, It was like hiking into a wonderland.",1,Alexandria,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"We visited Bryce in late October on a tour of several Western National Parks. The canyon is truly breathtaking--fabulous! Many of the formations seem to flow from inside in the rising or setting sun. Only Arches can possibly top it. All along the rim is a walking trail (mostly with no fence!) and many overlooks. For the younger crowd there are trails down into the canyon itself. We stayed in one of the rustic cabins that are located about 75 yards from the rim. The cabins are very basic (no TV), but one could easily stay at a motel outside the park. The nearby lodge restaurant is adequate. At an elevation of over 8,000 feet, it was cold, so check the local weather forecast before choosing clothing. Overall, Bryce is a truly stunning place to see. All the superlatives one could use apply. Do go to see for yourself!","October 31, 2010",Gorgeous--go see it!,5,Atlanta,5
Bryce Canyon National Park,"Of the seven National Parks I have visited this is the most memorable. Although it was the highest at over 9100 feet it is not as deep as some of the others, particularly the Grand Canyon but the shapes and colours of the hoodoos are stunning. As long as you don't want to do any of the long hikes down into the canyon you can see enough in a full day. Do beware if you hike into the canyon; on one day we saw 2 people having to have medical assistance through overstretching themselves. The Rim walk is best done downhill in the directtion from Bryce Point towards Sunrise point and the best views are between Upper Inspiration Point to Sunset Point. A free shuttle bus will drop and pick you up from various viewing points but don't necessarily stop at all points in both directions so check before setting out. Other attracttions for those with their own transport are Agua Canyon, Natural Bridge, Fairyland Canyon and Red Canyon. All are worth a visit.","October 18, 2010",Stunning,48,Wirral,5

I'm not a hiker and we did this 3 mile walk for about 3 hrs. that is with rest and picture taking in between.

Bryce Canyon National Park,"This park is really a treasure. It's even more jaw dropping amazing than either Zion or the Grand Canyon--both of which are pretty amazing in their own right.Bryce Canyon just has a presence about it that's almost other worldly. People tend to talk in hushed voices when they're at the rim or down in the canyon hiking. It just seems to command a certain respect from nearly everyone. It's really something special.The only downside compared to Zion or the Grand Canyon is it's a longer drive from any major airports and there are far fewer nearby amenities (Springdale outside Zion is *much* nicer than Bryce City or Tropic for example).If you can afford it, and it's not sold out, consider staying at the Lodge or one of the cabins in the park. Otherwise there are ample options in Bryce City, Tropic and elsewhere. You can also, of course, camp or use an RV.","September 23, 2010",Better than Zion and the Grand Canyon!,29,Northwest USA,5
