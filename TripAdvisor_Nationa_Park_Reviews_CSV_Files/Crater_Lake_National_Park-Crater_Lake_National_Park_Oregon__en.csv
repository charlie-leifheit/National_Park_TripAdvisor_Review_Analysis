Crater Lake National Park,"This summer my husband & I drove throughout California and Oregon visiting “cruise friends.” We always make the most amazing people on cruises! The two couples we visited were from our cruise on the Danube, Mein, and Rhine rivers. We enjoyed a variety of wine on that cruise and promised visits. While in Oregon our friends insisted we visit Crater Lake. I’m so glad they did. The only negative to our visit to the Park was our dinner in the restaurant. Service was slow and our orders were not correct. So, don’t plan to eat but DO plan to visit this amazing lake surrounded by snow covered mountains as late as June. Plan to hold onto your children though! Children were sledding down the roof slope. This looked like fun to children but not to grandparents!","October 14, 2019",Must be Seen to be Believed!,15,"Chattanooga, Tennessee",4
Crater Lake National Park,"You can't imagine the color of blue this lake is in the sunshine. It hurts your eyes and to think you are also looking into a crater of a volcano. The drive around the lake is beautiful and make sure you pull off at the turn arounds to see it all, We got lucky one day sun and blue but the next day what a surprise snow was everywhere and the whole park changed to another season for awhile. The national parks never cease to amaze me.","October 14, 2019",Blue Is The Word For This Lake,81,Pennsylvania,5
Crater Lake National Park,If you are a hiker then you need at least 2 full days. If you want to drive the rim and get out to look at the observations and do a few easy walks then a full day is good. It is not easy to get too and accommodations are not abundant within 20 miles. That being said you will not find anything like it in North America. It is truly amazing,"October 12, 2019",Simply amazing,387,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",5
Crater Lake National Park,"It was a perfectly clear day when we went to Crater Lake. To see it is unbelievable and hard to image that it is real. It is a 35 mile driving loop with many overlooks and pull overs. At each of the stops there are plagues telling you about what you are seeing and how the overlook got its name. We would suggest starting at the West rim and driving the Loop Eastward from there.It is hard to describe the beauty of the Lake. There are exhibits at the first time which explain the formation of the Lake. Even in mid-Sept there were Rangers available to answer questions.There are many beautiful picnic spots and driving the loop and stopping was 5 hours wonderfully spent. There are also many hiking trails along the way and when you first enter the Park make sure you get a brochure as this not only shows the overlooks, but the trails and degree of difficulty.As with all our national parks a true beauty!","October 12, 2019",Breathtaking,1,E.

Crater Lake National Park,"This may be one of the most beautiful parks in the national park system. Simply it's a beautiful, blue lake in a volcano. Of note though, the road the encircles the lake is a 2 lane, narrow road, with no guard rail. A bit of a white knuckle drive at times, but well worth it. We went in mid-September and is was very cold, so be prepared. Don't miss it.","October 11, 2019",Beautiful!,21,"Midlothian, Virginia",5
Crater Lake National Park,We parked at the Visitors Centre and walked up to the lake from there. It's stunning. Photographs just don't capture it's beauty.

Crater Lake National Park,"The lake and the surrounding area is beautiful. We were recommended to go on the east rim tour. I would recommend this, too. And it is worth while to calculate enough time to get down to the water. Unfortunatelly the park personnel/rangers were extremely unfriendly, that's why the momory of this day is not a good one.","October 9, 2019","Nature is great, but park personnel very unfriendly",39,switzerland,4

Crater Lake National Park,"In September, while visiting Oregon for a wedding, I had the pleasure of returning to Crater Lake N.P. The return trip did not disappoint! 20 years later, the parking areas, signage and visitor center are all upgraded and convenient, Amidst all these changes, the Lake is constant.  Thankfully, Crater Lake is as Awesome, Pristine and Reverent as I remembered. The magic of walking over the dry, rugged crest to view the beauty of the ever changing colors on and in the water was alive and well!","October 8, 2019",Return Trip Did Not Disappoint,3,Connecticut,5
Crater Lake National Park,"I have alwasys wanted to go to Crater Lake and was fortunate to take a trip here with my friends. It was 100% worth it. Went in July and there was still a small amount of snow on the ground. The sight of the lake itself was absolutely spectacular and was an astounding site. I would 100% recommend that all people see this beautiful place. You won't need bug spray on the ridge because of the high elevation, but if you go lower in elevation (like where the camping grounds are), you will definately need bug spray. The mosquitos there are HORRIFIC.","October 8, 2019","A ""must see""!",155,"Vancouver, Washington",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Visiting from the UK, we'd planned to drive over to Shady Cove from the Oregon coast stay the night then spend a full day visiting Crater Lake, however heavy rain was forecast so we went en-route to Shady Cove. We started driving the west rim of the lake & after 2 or 3 miles pulled into a viewpoint to find the lake was completely shrouded in cloud, it appeared driving further on would be fruitless as the situation was unlikely to change with low cloud, fog in places & rain turning to snow, so we reluctantly turned back. We popped into the visitor centre to check the forecast for the rest of the day/tomorrow, they confirmed our fears but suggested we hang around for a bit as often the skies clear. With nothing to lose we took their advice & noticed the sky brightening towards the east side, so we headed in that direction. What a great decision that was, to our delight it was blue skies & a reasonably good view of most of the lake. Whilst we would loved to have seen Crater lake in it's full glory we were thrilled to see what we did, non of the guidebooks we had mentioned taking into account weather conditions so we felt lucky to have seen this wonderful sight.Moral of the story, check the weather forecast & plan ahead, the weather may well ruin your visit.","October 8, 2019",Awesome,44,"Morpeth, United Kingdom",5

Crater Lake National Park,A three generation trip to Crater Lake and all I can say is WOW! We were staying in Sunriver and took a day trip to the lake. This trip was so worth the drive. We are from North Carolina and we know “blue”. Crater Lake is in its own league of “blueness”. It is gorgeous. We explored several of the pull over spots along the way to the lodge area. One was better than the next. This is a must do if you are in the area. It won’t disappoint.,"October 3, 2019",Breathtaking ,5,"Pinehurst, North Carolina",5
Crater Lake National Park,What a great national park. I visited in October when it was snowy but it made it look even more beautiful.

Crater Lake National Park,We went to the park twice. First day was cloudy with some rain. The lake was beautiful but we didn't do the hikes because of the weather. Second time we went it was sunny and gorgeous. Lake changed so drastically between the 2 visits. When the sun was shining it was so blue. Just gorgeous. If you're physically able I recommend taking the Cleetwood cove trail to the shore of the lake. Water is so clear!,"September 26, 2019",Must see!,34,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5
Crater Lake National Park,"I saw a post on social media and thought I needed to see this place. I was in Medford and decided to make the hour and a half trip. I am so glad we did! This is a beautiful spot. We hiked the rim trail and enjoyed the Watchman Lookout. We were delighted by the chipmunks and several even came up and inspected our cameras, allowing for great shots. Vidae Falls was great.If all you want is waterfalls though you may want a different park. Crater Lake holds its own though and I can’t stop thinking about her unrestrained beauty. I will come and see this again.","September 26, 2019",Unrestrained Beauty ,6,"Manteca, California",5

Crater Lake National Park,"If you are anywhere close, this is a Must- Do activity; it is simply spectacular. Other reviews provide the history of the volcano that collapsed 1.7 million years ago which created this beautiful and scenic lake. Plan on spending at least 3-hours driving around the entire lake. The Rangers do a great job of managing the surrounding areas and there are many available activities, including the trolley, boat rides, cycling, camping and incredible hiking. Great fun for the entire family!","September 23, 2019",Nothing Short of Spectacular!!,87,,5

Crater Lake National Park,"We were unfortunate with the fact that we picked the weekend when they had the bike friendly day, during which, the closed the east rim road (about 2/3 thirds of the loop), and only left the west rim road open to cars, but we still enjoyed it so much. If you’re planning to go in September, check for that event and plan accordingly. Eventually, they open up the east side after 6pm. You can spend your whole day at the park, we didn’t camp, but I’d definitely suggest doing that. There are a lot of trails to do. If you’re there just for the view and pictures, I would suggest doing the east side in the morning, then the west side in the afternoon, to align with the sun being behind you. The loop has vista points all around the lake, parking shouldn’t be a problem. If you’re looking to do the boat tour, they only operate for roughly 2 months in summer (July-August), according to the park ranger, depends on the snow condition in spring.Overall, the park is great for both family day trip, or multi-night camping trip. I’d definitely like to come back and visit again in the future.","September 22, 2019","Amazing experience, gorgeous lake!!! ",3,"San Jose, California",5
Crater Lake National Park,"What an amazing experience- Accessible for any age/level!The drive to the park is beautiful and fun to watch for wildlife. After we took a million photos at the main entrance point we went to the main center to get a map and some cool insights for things to do. With our 19 month old we got a late start to the day and had a 1.5hr drive back so we couldn't do any of the hikes but they were all labeled so well and made it super easy to decide what to do. We ended up doing the rim drive which was breathtaking! Our baby slept the whole time so it was a perfect way for us to see what we wanted to and him to get a nap so we didn't have a fussy little guy to deal with. We had dinner at the park restaurant which was so nice since we just wanted some real food instead of snacks, although lots of people had picnics they ate at one of the 30+ turn outs along the drive. AMAZING experience","September 22, 2019",This is truly awe inspiring!,5,"Traverse City, Michigan",5
Crater Lake National Park,"I remember as a small kid visiting this place with my family. It left a maked impression on me then. Now, as a senior adult, I wanted to share this experience with my spouse. We initially stopped by the Visitors Center to get information, get our bearings and to use the restrooms before venturing forth. The short drive to the crater's rim presented us with a beautiful panoramic view of the entire lake - absolutely beautiful! The drive that circles the crater allows for many stops to view and take pictures. No one driving is in a hurry and all want to take time to cature each moment was we move from place to place. The deep blue color of the lake is magnificant. It took us about 3 hours to drive around the entire rime. This is a fantastic place, one to treasure in our memories forever.","September 21, 2019",Breathtaking!,24,"Thousand Oaks, United States",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We visited the first week of August, so the road around the crater rim was fully open. If you go earlier in the year, it may not be open due to the massive amounts of snowfall they receive. We ate lunch at the Crater Lake Lodge, then started our drive around the lake. We hiked to the Watchman Peak Trail, which ascends about 450' in the half mile up. The starting elevation is about 7600' above sea level, so you end up around 8000'. Note that you can't enter the watchtower at the top. The views are great from here, and also from all the other overlooks around the loop around the rim.","September 21, 2019",Stunning scenery,8,Deer Park,5

It even has hoo doos that they call the pinnacles on a .8 mile hike.There is a beautiful lodge and they have campsites and cabins for rent. This park did open until July 15 because they had to clear the roads. There is a trolley ride around the lake that takes two hours. ","September 20, 2019",Awe Inspiring,238,"Apex, North Carolina",5
Crater Lake National Park,You must check the park service website before heading here. We were warmly greeted at the gate with the following info: Crater Lake is not visible today because it is snowing at that elevation. He was right we went from rainy day to an absolute snowstorm.

Its approximately 6 miles by 4.5 miles, 1943 ft deep and, dose, we are told holds 4.9 trillion gallons of water. We were up there in May, the night before had left 700 inches of snow with a further 84 inches forecast., the children were having great fun with snow-balls all this in May after the heat of San Francisco. if you can get there you will Not be disappointing.","September 17, 2019","""So So Blue""",4,,5

Crater Lake National Park,"We got there in the afternoon of a nice sunny day. I was shocked at the actual color of the water as I had kind of expected most pictures to be doctored a little. But it was awesome. So quiet, and just amazing how nature works. We spent and afternoon and a full morning here. I think a day is reasonable unless you are going to hike trails, then it could be much more. The pumice desert on the north entrance is pretty cool too. Take the trolley!","September 12, 2019",It really is that blue,41,"Neenah, Wisconsin",5
Crater Lake National Park,"The lake is gorgeous and truly a phenomenon of nature. However, if you need to use the restroom, grab one while you can because there are very few available. We finally found 4 'wc's' at a major lookout and they were all LOCKED! Also, there is only one place to find gas and you have to look for it! There are also only 3 places to eat - The Lodge (very expensive and mediocre), Annies (horrible and pricey), and a gift shop and cafe. Best to bring a cooler and your own food.","September 11, 2019","Spectacular lake, limited services",34,"Bend, Oregon",4
Crater Lake National Park,"The first view of Crater Lake is so stunning I could hardly move. What a spectacular scene, and to learn the history of how Crater Lake came to be is beyond words. We came in from the North and started the rim drive clock-wise from there. We stopped at nearly all of the lookouts and walked as much as we could. Never did we get tired of the magnificent blues of the lake. If you have the time, stay at the Lodge","September 10, 2019",Jaw-droppingly beautiful!,2,"Denver, Colorado",5

Crater Lake National Park,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Crater Lake National Park. Stunningly beautiful is still an understatement.Our only complaint is with the Standard Lake Boat Tour. Our tour was scheduled for 3:30PM on the last day the boats operated for the year. We checked in with the person at the top of the rim, walked down the trail to the lake shore, and then decided to use the restrooms before departing on the 2 hr tour.When we came out of the restrooms, we noticed a boat pulling away from the dock. It was 3:25PM. When I asked at the cabin/shack if that was the 3:30PM boat, the guy told me that it was. When I asked why it was leaving early, he just shrugged his shoulders. I asked if we could get on the next (and last) boat at 3:45PM, he told us it was already sold out.We went down to the dock, and were met by a very aggressive woman who told us she wouldn't speak to us and to leave the dock. Fortunately, there was one middle aged man there that approached us and spoke to us like human beings. He confirmed that they were aware that we had checked in at the rim, and had no answer as to why the boat departed early. He asked us to stand by and he'd see what he could do to get us on the last boat.Fortunately and thankfully, that is what happened. But the entire experience soured us on recommending this to any friends, family or acquaintances. The Park Ranger and boat captain were very professional and courteous, but I can't say the same for those organizing the process.","September 9, 2019",Issues with Standard Lake boat tour,2,"Westminster, Maryland",1
Crater Lake National Park,"Yes the water is really that blue! Went here in early July and still had significant snow drifts that caused much of the east rim trail and a few hikes to be closed. For the average vacationer you can spend 1 to 2 full days in this NP, after that you are stretching what to see, there's only so many different views of the lake. Definitely go to the bottom and touch the water (really jump in is best!) and head over to Sun Notch trail for the opposite view and some views of peaks. We did not take the boat to Wizard Island so I can't speak for that.","September 8, 2019",1 to 2 days max in the gorgeous place,101,"Orlando, Florida",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We stayed at the Worldmark in Klamath Falls, which is about ah hour south of the park. We drove the family up on a day of beautiful weather and enjoyed our walks along the rim at a couple different stopovers. There are a few amenities, but I would recommend bringing your own drinks and food or you'll pay for overpriced menu items. The sun is especially intense during summer months, so be sure to pack sunscreen, hats and sunglasses... they were essential and we all still got sun-kissed! The lake is absolutely stunning as are the surrounding cliffs. We missed the opportunity to hike down to the lake and line up for the boat ride... if you are interested in this, GO EARLY. We heard stories of people waiting for hours and not getting a spot.","September 6, 2019",Stunning vistas on the drive around the lake.,22,"Boise, Idaho",4
Crater Lake National Park,"If on budget, watch the video, drive around the caldera, take in the views and do a few of the short hikes. If not on budget, add the trolley tour which is very informational prior to doing the drive. We did the boat tour as well, but it was just too much.

We stopped at the gift shop/ cafe. Nothing great at gift shop and I would suggest packing your own food.The lodge is beautiful. There is a deck in the back overlooking the lake with a bunch of rocking chairs. There is a restaurant in the lodge. We didn’t eat there, but it looked good.There is a dock.

Crater Lake National Park,"There are no words in any language to express the feeling one gets at the first sight of this beautiful lake. You just stare, feel & absorb the atmosphere. No matter from which point of the rim you see it, the color, the beauty, the perfectness just amazes you. Yes the water is truly that blue. I wish we could go down and see the water from close, but the hike is straight down, so going down is difficult & coming back up is extremely strenuous. Some suggestions to prospective visitors: 1) Must see the short documentary on the history of the Crater Lake at the Visitor’s Center before making the trip around the rim. This makes the experience even more meaningful & impactful 2) It’s difficult to see all the points of interest on the 33-mile rim of the crater, so just go to these 7 most unique ones - Discovery Point; Watchman Outlook; Cloudcap Overlook; Pumice Castle Overlook; Phantom Ship Overlook; Pinnacles Overlook; and finally Vidae Falls. The detailed info on these points are available in the Visitors Center. If we ever come back to this place again I will definitely come back.","August 28, 2019",A Surreal and Awesome Experience,27,"Houston, Texas",5

The spectacular scenery and views of both the lake and mountains just takes your breath away. The drive took us 3.5 hours and we stopped at most of the viewing points. Plenty of picnic areas and restrooms and trails means you can take your picnic lunch and hiking gear and all the time you need.

Crater Lake National Park,"There are so many comments about Crater Lake NP online that you guys can acquire; however, there’s one important point I would like to remind you of. As soon you arrive the Visitor Info center, on the way out, you better make a left turn at the traffic flow (you can make a right turn as well) going clockwise direction (namely, you enter the WEST RIM entrance) . The reason for that is because it’s so much easier to make numerous stops for vista points and for safety driving purpose as well. As mentioned above, from the visitor center, you can make a right turn and get on the EAST RIM entrance, meaning you driving counter clockwise direction. This will make it a difficulty for numerous vista point stops because you have to cross the traffic flow, which can potentially cause an accident.In short, just enter the WEST RIM entrance for safety and convenience.Cheers!","August 25, 2019",Crater Lake National Park,15,"Huntington Beach, California",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We loved Crather Lake National Park. It's breathtaking! Try to sleep inside the park if you can, it makes a big difference. If you can get dinner reservations at the Lodge, go ahead and eat there. Otherwise, bring your own food. It will save you a lot of money, and will be much tastier than going to Annie Creek.

Crater Lake National Park,"We went to Crater Lake last summer and it was completely foggy from wildfires in Canada. We missed the deep blue water, etc. and had an opportunity for a retake this summer. What a difference!!! It is STUNNING. It takes an hour to drive around the rim, contrary to what some posters said about 4-5 hours. We stopped at maybe 10 of the vista points. BUT... you do need to take the Cleetwood Cove hike down to the lake shore! That will add time!","August 24, 2019",So glad we returned this year,22,Maryland,5
Crater Lake National Park,"Stunningly beautiful! The blue of the water just leaves you in awe. The main lodge is nice with restrooms, a small snack bar and gift shop. It is all pretty expensive however. Crater Lake is definitely worth seeing once if you haven't but I don't think we will ever go back.","August 23, 2019",Stunning and so interesting,18,"Longview, Washington",4
Crater Lake National Park,"The deepest, and probably the cleanest, 7700 year old lake in the US, Crater Lake should be on everyone's bucket list. The park (the oldest national park in the U.S. and the only one in Oregon), is replete with hiking trails and geological wonders. Go, see, hike, experience the rim trail but do NOT stay in Crater Lake Lodge. It is ill run, disgustingly dirty and staffed with many who just don't care.","August 22, 2019",Awe inspiring,239,"Jacksonville, Florida",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We visited 3 days in July & stayed in Chiloquin. Beautiful national park with many pull outs along the 33 mile rim drive. Weather was outstanding, clear blue skies every day. We did the east rim drive one day and the west rim drive the following. The Pinnacles stop was awesome, many tall spires of volcanic ash. We went to see the sunset at Cloudcap Overlook, in our opinion it was a better sight at Watchman Overlook on the West Rim Drive. Phantom Ship (Overlook) is a very small island only seen at this spot. Our daughter took the boat trip which entailed driving to Cleetwood Cove Trail and then walking down to the boat launch. Limited capacity, make reservations ahead! The trail is steep going down and warnings are clearly stated that anyone with difficulties descending and ascending to pass on this trip. She loved the experience and the ride was informative and beautiful. We feel for what we did that 2.5 days was a fair amount of time to spend here. Rim Village Café small with not much seating, gift shop ok, but were out of stock in many of the different souvenir t-shirts. Hard to understand why when it was only July 19. Found this to be true in some of the other national parks -Aramark (who runs the shops) needs to do a better job at ordering. One last word-we were there middle of July, due to remaining snow cover finally being cleared, all roads were only opened the week before, because of this late snow melt, there were a lot of mosquitos--bring repellant!

Crater Lake National Park,Was so excited to go to Crater lake and was not disappointed. You just stare out in awe. We did the Garfield Peak and Mount Scott hikes and both were fabulous. Great views from each and quite different terrain. Just not way to describe the blue of the water. Boat tour is a must do as it is the only way to get to the water and they give you a great description of how the lake was formed. Hike up from the water is hard when it is hot but take it slowly and anyone can make it,"August 18, 2019",Didn’t disappoint. Beautiful place,6,"Miami, Florida",5
Crater Lake National Park,"This lake is amazing. It is the deepest lake in America (2000 ft!) and it is freakishly blue - think Hawaii or the Caribbean - and clear. Even crazier, the lake doesn't drain - it's at an equilibrium point where the rain and snow coming in matches the evaporatin going out so the water levels don't change. That's right, the water has been sitting there for years and years and yet it is clear and beautiful. Amazing. We hiked down and swam in the water which was cool but by no means cold (the Rogue river, for reference, was much colder). It was the highlight of our trip to Southern Oregon.b Bonus tiP: The drive from the Crater to Medford on highway 62 is gorgeous!","August 18, 2019",Amazing story and beautiful lake,4,"San Antonio, Texas",5

Crater Lake National Park,"It is so blue! Based on my limited travel experience, the only comparable blue is in the Canadian Rockies. It is so out of the way though. Lots of driving no matter where you start. But it worth it. If you have to do one hiking trail, do the Cleetwood trail, the only trail going to the water. We swam at the bottom of the trail. It was cold at the beginning but after a few minutes you will get used to it. There are lots of crawfish swimming in the shallow water. My kids had lots of fun looking for them.

Crater Lake National Park,"We spent a night and a full one day at the lake. Stayed at the crater lake lodge. We began our visit and hiking adventure by hiking to the top of mount Scott, it took us about and hour and 30 min to go to the summit and about 45 min to come back down. It is well worth the effort to enjoy the views. Form there we drove to cleetwood trail which takes you down to the lake, it is about a mile down. The cliff jumping experience is great at this spot; my teenagers loved it. You can take a tour boat from here but will need to reserve well in advance. From there we drove to the watchman point to watch the sunset. This was very nice and one aspect of the trip that I was looking forward to. Lucky to be visiting on a moonless night we had a wonderful star watching experience at this spot as well. My family and I enjoyed this trip to crater lake.

Crater Lake National Park,"The first time I saw Crater Lake, it was from the airplane, I was on my way to Vancouver BC, it was 1975! I was so taken back by this beautiful blue gem, that I made myself a promise that I would personally see this lake. In 1980 with my two children in tow we did make that trek from Oklahoma to Oregon to see Crater Lake. It did not disappoint! My son who was only 5 at the time wanted to see Crater Lake again, so this year, we drove with his family and his daughter who is 6 to see Crater Lake. It is still as breathtakingly beautiful as it was 39 years ago! It is a marvel to see this amazing lake, to read the history of how it came to be. To be able to hike around the lake. We stayed in Medford, but next time we will stay at the lodge at Crater Lake, you have to a book almost a year in advance, it would be worth it to do that. The drive from Medford does take a couple of hours. This is one of those must do items if you are visiting Oregon!","August 7, 2019",Amazing!,11,"Portland, Oregon",5

Crater Lake National Park,"When we planned our trip to Crater Lake, we had a mental image of what the park would probably be like. Upon arrival, those images quickly were proven wrong. This is not another lake nestled between the mountains in a nice valley. This is a lake that sits in the top of the mountain where a volcano crater existed. There is a rim drive of about 30 miles around the lake, with several pull outs and parking areas for points of interest, trails, and scenic views. Parking at the ranger stations and concessions is pretty limited, even on a day when crowds are not as large. Odds of seeing much wildlife here are very limited, unless maybe you hike into a more remote area. The drive from Roseburg, OR to the park is a scenic, enjoyable one that takes approximately two hours. The park entrance fee is $25 per car.

Crater Lake National Park,"This is one of those places you have to see in person. The scale does not translate well in any photo. Much like the Grand Canyon, the vastness is theoretical until you see it with your own eyes.The water is so pure and blue it hurts to look at it. Pristine and (nearly) untouched. It’s too bad they now have motored boats that take people cruising. It would have been better to have kept the lake water pure as it has been for thousands of years, and virtually unaccessible to humans until now.The good part is hat you can drive the entire circumference of the crater and stop at key look outs, which makes it very accessible for people with mobility issues or very young kids. But if you can, take the opportunity to walk up one of the many hikes up to the top of one of the ridges. The climb gives you and unparalleled view of the lake and the hard effort makes the payoff that much more worth while.Highly recommend!","August 4, 2019",Mind Blown.,128,"Delft, The Netherlands",5

Crater Lake National Park,"Genuinely beautiful, with the bluest lake water you will ever see. If you have time, book (well in advance) the boat trip out to Wizard Island, and hike one mile to the top. I know of no other place where you can stand atop the cinder cone of a volcano in a lake created by the collapse of a volcanic mountain. You can walk around the caldera of Wizard Island and get a unique 360 view from the lake. The ranger talk on the boat to and from the island is also very good. Really, there are very few viewpoints or trails in this park that aren’t gorgeous. Well with your time. If you have kids with you, pick up a piece of pumice stone along the trail that leads to the lake, and place the pumice in the water. Pumice floats in water. They will be amazed!The only caution I have is that lodging in the area is in high demand, and some is of poor quality with unscrupulous owners. Choose carefully. We stayed at the Crater Lake Bungalows — The Chalet, and it turned out to be home to a colony of bats. We had bats swooping around in the house at night, crawling on the floor, etc. Bad experience.

The map you get at the entrance, has all the hikes offered in the park, described to a tee and accurately.The first day, I've driven through the entire loop from east to west, stopped almost at every view point and did a few easy hikes and one moderate.It's an amazing view from every point, some has perfect reflections in the lake.If you are here for a day, I think that should be perfect for you.Easy and short hikes - Castle Crest, Sun Notch, The Pinnacles, Plaikni FallsModerate hike - Watchman Peak.Second day - Stopped for a few more perfect pics before going on the Mount Scott Trail.Second hike was Cleetwood Cove. Did it after the boats finished, because this spot is probably the most congested one in the park. In order to get to the boat that takes u to Wizard Island, u have to go on this hike.CAMPINGThe area is full of campgrounds, the ones offered inside the park, were less inviting to me.After reading a bit, chose Broken Arrow Campground, which is close enough to the park, yet offers more.The campsites are spacious, there are free showers with hot water and flush toilets.However!

Crater Lake National Park,"This review is meant to help anyone intending to go to Crater Lake National Park this year (2019), because the information offered by the management company (ArrowMark) is not accurate. We would have planned our trip differently if we had had the following knowledge. Skip to the end if you just want to know how you should plan.BACKGROUNDWe visited Crater Lake National Park in July of 2019. We arrived on July 15th and departed on July 16th. We originally intended to camp for 2 nights, but bailed on the second night, largely because the park services were so badly organized. Here is what we experienced and learned:CAMPGROUNDS[What we experienced]: The Lost Creek tent-only campground is closed, most likely for the rest of the season. The stated reason is the removal of “hazard” trees. Similarly, the Annie’s Creek campground (RV/tent) also 2 loops closed, also for “hazard” tree removal. We camped at site D33, which was directly adjacent to the closed loops of the campground (replete with blaze-orange fencing and front-end loaders growling and beeping in the morning).[What we learned]: Reserve your campsite ahead of time, because there will be NO available sites this summer. Pacific Coast Trail hikers will be passing through, and if anyone grabs the odd spare site, it will be a PCT hiker. Reserve your site if you want to camp in the park.BOAT TOURS[What we experienced]: The NPS literature stated that boat ride tickets can be obtained by reservation or by ticket kiosks located in either the Rim Village lodge or the Annie’s Creek gift shop. If you had not reserved tickets (18 reserve-able tickets per tour) before coming to the park, there were supposed to be 19 non-reserve-able tickets available. The idea was the tickets could be got by accessing these kiosks; the 19 non-reserve-able tickets would become available on the kiosks exactly 24 hours prior to the start of the scheduled tour (i.e. if the tour departs on the 16th at 1:30pm, the 19 tickets would become available on the 15th at 1:30p.m. at the kiosks).[What we learned]: None of that was true. Here is what was actually true, point by point:1. The kiosks do not exist.2. The 19 non-reserve-able tickets do not exist.3. The ONLY way to get on a boat without a reserved ticket is to go to Cleetwood Landing the morning of the scheduled boat tour and ask the guys in the shack at the parking lot.4. Nobody in the entire park knows what in the hell they are talking about when it comes to boat tours, except for the guys in the shack. That sounds like I’m exaggerating. Nope- that’s how it is.5. The guys in the shack only accept cash ($44 a person).6. There are no ATMs in the entire park.7. There should be 2 boats, but one of them failed certification, so the park is only operating with 1 boat. As a result, they’re trying to jam all the people who made reservations onto one boat. That’s apparently the reason there are no non-reserve-able tickets.8. RESERVE YOUR TICKETS BEFORE YOU COME OR DO NOT EXPECT TO GET ON A BOAT.FOOD[What we experienced]: The food was awful and shockingly overpriced. The service was provided by cheerful 20-something college students with no ability to assist you and even less desire to do anything other than their prepared script. The Rim Village lodge requires a complicated reservation process to get you table (there were several obviously vacant tables when they turned us away). A standard ribeye costs $39 on their menu. After being turned away at the lodge, we went to the Annie’s Creek cafeteria where I bought a $14 dollar cheeseburger and exactly one $8, 12-oz can of beer. The burger tasted like a lukewarm circle of cardboard soaked in beef grease stuck between a couple of dusty wads of Kleenex. The kid that brought it was cheerful, though.[What we learned]: DO NOT PLAN TO HAVE A NICE MEAL AT THE PARK. It’s either grotesquely overpriced or/and of very poor quality.DISCUSSIONWhile trying to find an ATM to get cash to pay for tickets for a boat tour, we drove to Fort Klamath (no ATMs there, by the way) and ran into a really nice local couple. They told us that they used to go up to the Rim Village lodge at least a couple of times a week for dinner, but they don’t anymore because ArrowMark took over the park services from Xanterra, and the food and service rapidly declined. According to this couple, Xanterra had perfected a good product, but the Park Service wanted to contract with one company for services for both the Crater Lake and Oregon Caves NPS sites. Xanterra declined to do it. ArrowMark said that they could handle it, so NPS handed them the contract, but ArrowMark doesn’t know what the hell they’re doing. As a result, the services drastically suffered.CONCLUSION1. Crater Lake is a magnificent park and a special place. Visit this place, because it is beautiful and unique.2. If you are camping, reserve your site ahead of time. Otherwise, abandon all hope of camping in the park.3. If you want to go on the boat, reserve your ticket ahead of time. Otherwise, abandon all hope of getting on a boat after coming to the park.4. If you want to eat anything prepared by the park, expect it to be overpriced and very bad.5. The only park staff worth talking to are actual NPS rangers. Nobody else has any idea what they’re doing, and they will not be able to help you.","July 16, 2019","Visit the park, not the services.",8,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",3

Crater Lake National Park,"I had vacationed in Crater Lake 4-5 years ago when a Dear friend described it to me as I titled my review this time. I cannot recall if this is my second review on Trip Advisor of this heavenly blue lake.Although it was my second visit, I still find it magnificent! I could not stop taking pictures. My friends were also in awe even if one of the two had, like me, toured Oregon earlier.We negotiated the Cleetwood Cove Trail hike with hiking sticks. Views are amazing throughout. My favorite from our hike is the first picture on the left. People jumped in the lake, swam and fished.Book a boat ride in advance if you are interested in going around the lake. We thought we could buy tickets when we got there on 15 July but the boats were fully booked. The two-hour ride costs $44 and has to be paid in cash at the boat landing. The ticket counter in the parking lot may take credit cards.We drove the east rim from the north entrance. The South Rim remains to have the best viewing and picture spots.In mid July, there is snow!

You can see the erosion and loss of plant life due to this, which is quite sad. -Fill up your gas tank before you enter the park if you're running low... there is 1 small gas station within the park with only 87 unleaded Overall such a stunning place worth visiting.

I would advise having bug spray, the mosquitoes were all over the place the day we were there and it was hard to escape them without the spray. We started off at the visitor center and watched the video, had our National Parks Passport stamped and then made our way to the Rim. We really liked sitting behind the lodge and over looking the lake, it was peaceful and we were able to just take time and sit back. There was still a lot of snow in the area and we knew this ahead of time by reading through the information on the website. We were really just looking for the view and taking some time to step back and enjoy. It was worth the drive and the views were spectacular.

Apparently it often doesn’t open until the middle of July, but I never would have known that looking at their website in winter when planning the trip.What we saw of the Lake was absolutely gorgeous.

Crater Lake National Park,The “bluest” lake we have ever seen. Spectacular views at the start of the summer (July) when there is still plenty of snow. Expect the tougher hiking trails to be closed in early July due to snow. And be prepared for traffic congestion. The day we visited (5th July) we arrived by 8.30 and there was no line up to the park. When we left at 2.30 the line of cars to get in was about 2 miles long! The good news is that most people just drive from one parking lot to the next and don’t walk very far. (Many Americans seem to be incapable of walking more than a few hundred yards).

It was hard to find parking up at Rim Village and some of the overlooks. It was still worthwhile spending time at Crater Lake but I think one or two days would be enough.

If you are looking for something besides burgers and pizza, consider making reservations. The prices are not cheap but what do you expect in a tourist area with few other food options?

When you get up to the lake there is a building with souvenirs and food available. We were told the concessioner company was new and still figuring things out when we visited, but they were fine once you understood they're new. The lake itself is worth the drive off of the interstate. If you have time a visit to this park should go into your itinerary.

Crater Lake National Park,"We drove up to Crater Lake from Klamath Falls early in the morning and spent one full day exploring the National Park. A NPS pass or entrance fee is required; $12-25 depending on the time of year and mode of transportation. Our strategy was to travel the Rim Drive scenic route around the lake first before traffic became heavy, and we drove it clockwise from Rim Village (about 30 miles, closed in winter). There are many viewpoints and overlooks along the way, and several picnic areas. There were wildfires burning in the region when we were there, so the air was smoky. I thought the best views on Rim Drive were at The Watchman Overlook (Wizard Island), Cloudcap Overlook, and Phantom Ship Overlook. Don't miss Vidae Falls along Rim Drive; the waterfall is on the south side of the lake, on the west (lake) side of the road, just south of the intersection with Grayback Drive where there's a picnic area and trail head for Crater Peak. We turned off Rim Drive onto Pinnacles Road and headed southeast to the trail head for Plaikni Falls (about 1 mile down the road on the east side). It's an easy trail that leads about a mile through the forest to a lovely waterfall. The path is wide and mostly level, so we were able to take a wheelchair almost to the end where it got a bit too steep for comfort. Next we drove 4.8 miles to the end of Pinnacles Road to the trail for Pinnacles Overlook. This is another wide, level trail that leads a short distance (about .5 mile) along the rim of a canyon to a couple of viewpoints for the Pinnacles formations. We were able to get a wheelchair down this path with determination, but there were sections where it bogged down in deep, sandy soil. After we finished these hikes, we returned to Rim Village where we walked the paved sidewalk along the rim between the cafe'/shop and the lodge. We had a pleasant lunch at the dining room in the lodge and admired the historic architecture. There's a magnificent view from the patio on the back of the lodge, and also from the path that continues east from the lodge (becomes Garfield Peak Trail). The west end of Rim Village around the cafe'/shop, visitor center, and popular Sinnott Overlook was the most congested with traffic and tourists. We went inside the shop building to purchase a t-shirt and it was truly chaos- we left as quickly as possible. We wanted to hike the Godfrey Glen Trail near Mazama Village in the afternoon before we left the park, but that 1-mile accessible nature trail was closed for renovation. We used the extra time to explore the Rogue River Gorge at Prospect on our way to Medford for the night, and I highly recommend that attraction as well. We're planning to swing by Crater Lake again this summer, hoping for a clearer day and a second chance at Godfrey Glen.","April 18, 2019",Glorious Lake in a Volcanic Caldera,1781,"Tucson, Arizona",5

Last July, our dream of seeing this incredible lake finally came true!!Due to a flat tire, we only had about 3 hour of daylight left to explore what we could. Let me tell you that what we did see of Crater Lake did not disappoint. It is truly STUNNING!!! Cannot help but stare at this deep blue lake. Did you know that it is the deepest lake in the United States? Also, it is located inside a dormant volcano that collapsed after a major eruption 7,700 years ago!!! Oh, how I wish we had the time to drive around the entire lake. Would have been great to stop at each viewpoint to admire the sights and do some hiking.

Crater Lake National Park,"This park, which is technically open 24 hours a day, doesn't have all of its roads open year-round. The two roads that bracket the lake-the must-sees West Rim Drive and the East Rim Drive-are open during the middle of the year. On the website, the opening dates in the last 15 years for the North entrance and West Rim Drive ranged from May 14 in 2015 to June 24 in 2011 and its closing date from October 14 in 2016 to November 1 in 3 of the past 9 years. The East Rim Drive has been June 11 (2015)-July 22 (2011) through October 1 (2013)-November 1 (2011, 2015). Check their website and even call ahead if your visit is in these ranges!We entered from the north gate on October 6, 2018 around noon, squarely within the potential closing date. It was a bit cloudy, but the gate was open, the road was clear, there was snow in some of the higher elevations, but no ""threat"" to the road. We took the East Rim Drive and went counterclockwise around the lake, which put the pullouts on the right all of the way around, which got more spectacular as we went along, as the sun came out. By the time we reached the first one-less than 1/2 hour-the fog was lifting. Keep to the speed limits and take it the variety of scenery in: the lake, the plains, snow-capped peaks, rock formations, small waterfalls close to the road. There is plenty of time to explore somewhat, but if you've only got a day, you'll have to pick and choose somewhat. To give you a yardstick, we saw the Vidae Falls, Steel Visitor's Center (saw the film), the Lady of the Woods Trail (and hiked it), Rim Village, Lodge, and at stopped at several pullouts in perhaps five hours there, leaving the park at the north entrance as the sun was setting.This off-season jaunt was very worthwhile: though on the cold side, it was nothing that layers couldn't conquer, and well worth the tradeoff of no crowds!","December 22, 2018","Worth a trip, but...",155,"Everett, Washington",5

Best to check the National Weather Service ( Medford, Oregon) for weather conditions before going. The Steel Visitor Center has an excellent 22 minute video about the geologic history and formation of Crater Lake. Known as Giiwas in the Klamath language, the lake was formed when Mount Mazama erupted 7700 years ago and was subsequently filled by precipitation only. The blast, 40 times more powerful than the 1980 eruption of Mt St Helens, forms part of the oral history of the Klamath and other tribes.

But it was worth the extra hour to drive the opposite direction and to see natural waterfalls, and to hike up a small trail to another overlook. It has to be on everyone's bucket list.

I'm lucky to see the lake first in a perfect sunny day where the lake looks Spectacular & great for taking pictures.

Crater Lake National Park,"I was working in nearby Klamath Falls and finished extremely early one day. I had it in my mind that if I found spare time I would try to drive up to the park and walk around. I'm really glad that I found the time, because for me, being from the Midwest, seeing places like this resets your whole notion of what the United States has to offer in terms of natural beauty. Pictures can't do the lake justice, you have to stand on the lip of the crater and look down, and to look out miles to the peaks that line the other side. I only got to walk a short arc of the crater's edge, but I could see that there were trails that led several miles in different directions. There is also a lodge near the visitor center where people can stay for a prolonged experience of the park. The drive from Klamath Falls to the park was beautiful to begin with, as was the drive back to Medford (about 2 hours) where I had a flight to catch the next morning.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is in a crater about 60-miles NW of Klamath Falls, in south-central Oregon. It is the main feature of Crater Lake National Park and is famous for its deep blue color and water clarity. The lake partly fills a nearly 2,148-foot deep caldera that was formed about 150 years ago by the collapse of the volcano Mount Mazama. With a depth of 1,949 feet, the lake is the deepest in the US. We entered the park from the north on Hwy. 97, and connected with the Rim Drive, a 33-mile rim road on the edge of the caldera. It's seasonal and narrow in spots, but in good shape and snow free during the summer. It's closed in the winter. It allows access to the crater's features, the trail heads, and some spectacular scenery. We found it helpful to pick up the park newspaper at the entrance kiosk. It has a great rim drive map.Watchman Overlook offers great views of Wizard Island, the larger of the two lake islands.Rim Village is where you will find the Park Headquarters, the Visitor Center, the Lodge and Restaurant, and information about being on the water. Lake boat trips, fishing excursions, permits for overnight backpacking adventures, and anything else you need to know is here.Sun Notch on the SE edge, is the trail head for the Phantom Ship hike and a great place to see the Phantom Ship from the drive. From here, you can also take a 6-mile side trip on a paved road back to the Pinnacles Overlook.Pumice Castle, bright orange eroded pumice rock in the shape of a castle, is one of the most colorful features of the park. It's visible from the overlook and there is a trailhead. Finally, there is Cloudcap Overlook at the end of a one mile long paved side road.Dress in removable layers. It is cooler on the rim than you might expect and the wind is unstoppable and often frigid. There can be snow, even in the summer and rain at any time.Good hiking shoes are also important. The trails can be be sandy and slippery. The edges of the overlooks are rarely fenced and are brittle and crumbly. Dogs are allowed but only in certain areas and must always be leashed.We were very impressed.

It is 2.2 miles up and down. Easy to walk down, it takes around 20 minutes. At places it is steep and slippery, so be careful and slow. Better to take a trekking pole. Walking back is strenuous and will take 40 minutes. Take a bottle of water. Some adventurous youth swam in the cold waters in October. The water is so clear, serene and peaceful.

The views (when the lake is viewable, which it isn't always as we've learned) are outstanding!

Crater Lake National Park,"Be forewarned: Crater Lake is remote, and all roads going there are twisting, narrow mountain roads. Beautiful, but slow. The lake looks just like the photos you've always seen. It's history is fascinating. The original explosion 7000 years ago was witnessed by local Indians and their oral history passed down. Be sure to sign up in advance for the Trolley tour. Ranger led, it stops at every major overlook and you learn so much. ","October 7, 2018",Amazing lake!,10,"Dallas, Texas",5

Crater Lake National Park,"We had visited Crater Lake National Park 46 years ago and always wanted to return. Time and circumstances prohibited a second visit until this year. A visit to the West Coast of the US prompted us to finally return. We flew into Medford, OR, and from there we rented a car and drove to the park. We decided not to take Route 5, which would have been the fastest, but instead, took the highway that led through the forests en route to the Lake. We were practically the only ones on the roads through the forests and were therefore able to stop whenever we wanted to get out and walk a bit. Unfortunately, we were there just after the terrible forest fires of the summer of 2018 and we were hit by the acrid smell of smoke everywhere. We saw the devastation, but were reminded by the locals, that the fires provide an opportunity for the forests to reproduce themselves to greater beauty. (The cup was clearly half full.) We arrived at Crater Lake in the early evening and stayed at The Cabins at Mazama Village. (See my review.) Early the next morning, we arrived at Crater Lake before the tourists arrived and had the scene all to ourselves. We were a bit worried that we had over-dramatized the beauty of the lake in our memories and that we would be disappointed when we actually arrived. How foolish of us to worry about disappointment. We first saw the lake in the first light of morning. As the hour progressed, the sun became stronger and what we had remembered as an overwhelmingly beautiful scene, was reinforced. The quiet, the light, and the sheer magnitude of beauty was exactly as we had remembered Crater Lake. We walked around part of the rim, taking in the lake from different angles. After an hour or so, we realized that there were still not a lot of tourists, so we took a chance on having breakfast in The Lodge at Crater Lake. Although we could not get reservations to stay there, we thought that perhaps we might be able to have breakfast in the restaurant. Even the Lodge was exactly as we had remembered it. We were lucky enough to be able to have a very special breakfast in the dining room and then to sit on the veranda of the Lodge to view the Lake. We then went to the official Tourist Center for the film about Crater Lake and to ask questions from the rangers on duty. In all, it was a fabulous visit. If one has the opportunity to see Crater Lake, I would advise not to miss it.","October 1, 2018",Still Breathtaking After 46 Years.,99,"Jerusalem, Israel",5

Crater Lake National Park,"Visiting Crater Lake National Park far exceeded our expectations! Our only disappointment was that our travel itinerary only allowed us a 1-night stay at Crater Lake Lodge. I first heard of Crater Lake many years ago, but became enthralled with it after having seen a segment about Crater Lake’s Old Man on CBS Sunday Morning! You can view the segment by searching “On the Trail: The Old Man of Crater Lake” — it’s available on YouTube! Anyway, after having viewed this segment for a second time recently, we decided to squeeze Crater Lake into our travel plans to the Northwest — with no regrets other than wishing that we could have stayed longer! Scenery, camping, hiking, biking — if you’re looking for outdoor adventure, you won’t be disappointed in a visit to Crater Lake National Park!Regarding our stay at Crater Lake Lodge — it was outstanding! The original Lodge structure has been renovated and reinforced, and is situated in the perfect spot — right on the rim of the crater! You might not enjoy your stay at the Lodge if you can’t live without TV, as there are none available for viewing, but you have the best picture out your window if you’re fortunate to have a lakeside room; otherwise, make your way to the veranda and have a seat in one of the many comfortable rocking chairs! Additionally, we ate Lunch, Dinner, and Breakfast in the Crater Lake Lodge Dining Room and were very pleased with the quality of the food and the service, for each of our meals! One final word regarding the Lodge accommodations — the rooms are not the most up-to-date, but the king-size bed in our room was extremely comfortable! However, we were not visiting Crater Lake to be pampered in our room, we were there for the view — which did not disappoint!","September 27, 2018",A Crown Jewel!,0,"Wexford, Pennsylvania",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is a special place, uniquely beautiful with its deep, rich, blue color that I have seen nowhere else in the world.The NPS provides a road that circles the entire Lake with numerous easy pulloff overlooks offering great views. There are also trails ranging from less than a mile to 5+ miles that take you up steep peaks and down the rim to the surface of the Lake. There's also a detour to some interesting volcanic rock formations.There are boat tours, but, unfortunately, they weren't operating when I was there.It's very remote, has no cell phone reception at all, and parts of it close as early as October due to the heavy snowfall here.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is possibly the most stunning of all the National Parks simple because first, you don't see it and then you do. With the lake's rich and textured blue it is a one-of-a-kind moments to be remembered for a lifetime. A trip by car around the lake is an easy drive, even with snow along the road, you can do it. The legend is that the bluebirds were once a dull grey, but they dipped their wings into the lake and it forever changed them. If you want a great trip to a very small National Park, then you should move this one to the top of the list of must-see's and rest well in the cool mountain air before heading to your next destination. Soak in the blue of sky and water and, for the adventurous, take a walk from the road to the lake shore. They say it is about 700-feet down to the lake and 7000-feet back up to the road. Boat trips are available to the small island. The boat? It was brought in by helicopter as was the cabin on that Wizard Island.

We took many of the more reasonable trails, especially off the rim road. We did drive out the Pinnacles and that was worthwhile. The Godfrey Glen Trail was being worked on when we took it, but was open for foot traffic and still worth the hike even with the dust.

Crater Lake National Park,"This park is a Delight. It is not as popular as some of the big name national parks, but it offers the clearest and most beautiful lake you could ever hope to find. It is well recognized as having the clearest lake water, so clear that you can see to a depth of almost 150 feet. You can’t get to the shore except for one location on the north rim and this has a vertical requirement of about 700 feet. Keep this in mind given your fitness. Remember that your at about 7000 ft elevation. There are plenty of other hiking trails to enjoy, and the rim drive is about 33 miles and affords some excellent views. Sunset from the watchman overlook is just one special option. You’ll find helpful rangers at the park visitor center, and this is always a good first stop to get the lay of the land and suggestions based on your interests.

The Cleetwood Cove hike is a bit steep with 700 feet of elevation gain, but the trail is well maintained. Every view as you go down is different and thrilling. My personal favorite was the last bend before the bottom. You can swim at bottom if cold water doesn’t bother you. It is incredibly clear. Fun hike. We also did Sun Notch and Watchman Peak Trail, but do Cleetwood if you are only doing one hike. If you are in a rush, you could just spend a couple hours at park and only do the overlooks. It would still be well worth it.","September 20, 2018",Stunning,49,"Boardman, Ohio",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake has been on our list of things to do for a while. We decided to take the boat ride out to Wizard Island and explore the island on this trip.We arrived at the park right at sunrise and enjoyed the amazing colors of the lake as the sun broke over the horizon. We had to wait a little bit for the rangers to open the ticket booth at the top of the trail (you have to check in at both the top and bottom of the trail for the boat trip). There are bathrooms available at the parking lot as well as near the dock at the bottom of the trail. The walk down was quite easy, with amazing views of the lake the whole way down.The boat ride was only 20-30 minutes and then we were off to explore the island. We went up the peak first. It was somewhat steep, but the views along the way were so amazing I didn't mind the stops to catch my breath.After a quick snack up top, we went back down and explored the trail to Fumarole Bay. This was a significantly more challenging trail. Several parts of it required walking on rocks of various sizes and stability. Again, the views were amazing.Once we were back to the dock area, we visited the bathrooms there and then stripped off our socks and shoes to enjoy the cool water of the lake on our feet.

This was clockwise from north rim so pullouts were on right. Gorgeous views. We knew we had really gotten lucky. We visited the gift shop and checked in at Crater Lake Lodge for one night. Expensive, yes.. but worth the experience? Absolutely. Sat in the rocking chairs and looked at this unbelievably beautiful lake for as long as we wanted . Only thing missing was sweet tea! We hiked the gentle Discovery Trail for 2+ miles which gives you all the views you could want. We had packed sandwiches, breakfast rolls and snacks so didn't use the restaurant. The lodge is beautiful. We found the room comfortable. Got up early to catch sunrise over the lake from the back of the lodge with a dozen or so other guests. Awesome! The lodge provided the coffee and had their big fireplace blazing! We checked out and took the West rim out the north entrance where we started.

One is at the top and is close to the famous old lodge. There are hiking trails close to there as well. A short drive down the south side gets you to the restaurant and general store.

Crater Lake National Park,"We spent four days here, staying in Mazama Village(please see separate review for some very important tips). We have traveled extensively and have rarely seen anything more spectacular than Crater Lake. We did a lot in our four days, and everything was sensational. The Crater Rim Trolley tour was a great introduction to the park and eased our minds about the next day hike to Cleetwood Cove for the boat tour to Wizard Island. Our guide was great, always willing to answer all questions and the tour was at a very comfortable pace. The Wizard Island Boat Tour was fabulous. We went in the morning at 9:45, leaving Mazama Village at 7:00 which gave us plenty of time to walk down to the dock. Be aware that if you are hiking Wizard, you need lunch, and plenty of water(there are only gallons of water for sale in the park, so be sure to bring refillable water bottles). We were told there would be water at the trail head and at the dock, but there was not. We were informed that the ""dude"" who was to bring the water had not made it yet. The tour guide did stop on the way back to shore to fill up water bottles from the lake if you are comfortable with that. This tour is challenging especially the first part of the trail at Wizard which is over lava rocks and the return hike up Cleetwood Cove-they are telling the truth when they say it is difficult and steep-however my husband who is 75 and had open heart surgery a year ago managed it-so if you think you can, it is well worth the time and money. The view of the crater on top of Wizard is something you will never see again, so go for it!. We watched the park film(great), went to several ranger talks (all very interesting and the rangers very knowledgeable). We hiked to the Pinnacles(you must do this-easy hike and unlike anything else in the park). We also hiked to Plaikini Falls which was beautiful and to Sun Notch for a very different view of the Phantom Ship. Most people do not spend this much time at Crater Lake but we knew we would only be there once, and were glad to have this much time. I know my view is colored by the fact that we had smoke free, cloud free weather the entire time we were there, but this is truly one of the most beautiful places we have ever seen. Because it is not so easy to get to Crater Lake my advice is to give yourself more time to enjoy this national treasure.","September 14, 2018",Simply Gorgeous!,174,"Lake Charles, LA",5

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is absolutely beautiful. We went Aug. 26 on with an organized week long tour. We did have some visibility issues because of the California fires, but the view was still outstanding. We learned a lot from our National Park Ranger who gave us the history of the lake's formation, the importance to our Native Americans and their culture, and current data about it. We had views of Wizard Island from most of our pull off stops. Some views were ethereal. Cruises of Crater Lake are available but to get to the boat, you have to climb down the rather steep crater wall on a rough trail, and of course, what goes down, must go up at the end of your cruise. There are a number of places to pull off the road for various views of the walls, islands, and Castle Rocks.We were on a large tour bus and I sometimes hung my head as we were very close to an edge and I have problems with heights. But the rest of the time was wonderful.Put this on your bucket list and that of your family. So worth it!

Crater Lake National Park,"Visited the Tuesday after Labor Day. Easy drive from La Pine to north entrance. Arrived 8:30. No one was manning entrance. Payment ($25) was to be placed in envelope as cash or with credit card info. Secure deposit box was overflowing, so had to place in unsecured box with others where I assume maps should have been.Per other recommendations, proceeded clockwise around lake. For the entire east rim drive there were never more than 2 other cars at each stop, except for Cleetwood Cove. Caught up to crowds at Steel Visitor Center. Parking lots were near capacity for west rim drive. Arrived back at north entrance about 11:20. It was now manned with a line of about 12 cars.We stopped at all the major overlooks and several pullouts. I recommend stopping at all the overlooks and be sure to stop at some of the pullouts on north end of lake. There’s not much to see at Cleetwood Cove unless you hike down to the lake. The Sun Notch has the best view of Phantom Ship. It’s requires a short hike; when the trail forks, go left. The ONLY RESTROOMS are at Cleetwood Cove, Steel Visitor Center, and the Rim Village.I recommend looking at the Crater Lake Park information at nps.gov before you visit. There are links to webcams as well as a link to the PARK NEWSPAPER which has a good map as well as detailed information on overlooks and trails. The newspaper was also available at the Steel Visitor Center, but I liked planning ahead.It was slightly hazy when we arrived. By the time we left the smoke was getting much heavier. I highly recommend going early and starting with the more scenic east rim if you can. By driving clockwise, most of the steep drop offs are on the opposite side of the road. We thought it was a fairly easy drive compared to other mountain roads we’ve navigated.There was a short section of road construction on the SE side of the lake. We were told the wait would be up to 10 minutes, but we were on our way much sooner.","September 9, 2018",Lovely National Park,8,"Houston, TX",5

Crater Lake National Park,"We were camping here on Labor Day weekend and it was 75% full. Even so the sites were well designed to give campers a sense of privacy and intimacy with nature.

We started our full day early and got up to the rim Lodge and the trolley in time to make reservations for the rim tour. This is well worth the money--no one has to be ever alert going around the crater and a ranger provides explanations of the significance of what you are seeing. The Mazama Village store has ample supplies and the prices are not too jacked. Our surprise is that the Crater Lake is really the only focus of the park, unlike other national parks with several key elements.

Crater Lake National Park,"This place takes a bit of a drive to get to, but when you get there, it is really beautiful. I wish we had more time to do some more hiking and maybe even the boat ride, but even so, the drive around the rim was so so scenic and allows for many photo opportunities. Beware, though, the photos you take do absolutely no justice to what you actually see with the naked eye.Make sure to take the little 7 mile detour to see the Pinnacles - nature's architecture is amazing. Also, depending on what time you get to the park, I would do the loop starting at the north side, going clockwise vs counterclockwise. It makes it a lot easier to pull off to the right to see the many many many scenic overlooks. And traffic seemed to be much better going this way vs the way everyone else goes.","September 6, 2018",Yet another great NP,45,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5

We spent the whole day, doing an early morning boat tour (highly recommended), driving around the rim, enjoying the visitors center and ending the day with drinks and appetizers on the patio at the lodge overlooking the lake. Areas are quite spread out with having to drive the rim road, so plan your time accordingly. We did an early morning boat tour and ate a packed lunch in the car while we drove the rim. The visitors center was worth a stop just to watch a movie on how the lake was created. End your day at the lodge for an ice cream, drinks, appetizers on the patio. It was worth taking a look around the lobby of the lodge as well.","September 2, 2018",This needs to be on your list of things to do,555,"Aurora, Colorado",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We went there Aug 26-27, 2018. The sky was clear.According to the rangers, the sky was smoky for the last few weeks. So, we were lucky.We booked the Wizard Island tour and hiked to the top. It was nice, but also very tiring.The boat tour was also very nice. The ranger gave us a lot of info and stopped at many places and explained lot of things to us.We bought with us extra water (for the return hike back up). However, that was probably not needed because the ranger helped us re-filled our water bottles on the return boat trip.Overall, the boat tour was very nice. If someone in your party is not very fit, I would say, don't do the Wizard Island boat tour, or limit the hiking on Wizard Island to save energy for the hike back up to your car later.","September 1, 2018",View was very beautiful.,28,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Love that the lake is very difficult to access - only when you slide down to the only boat ramp are you at water level. This keeps the lake mostly free of trash, people, sunscreen, perfumes, cigarette butts, etc. Went around the whole lake for the first time. Had been here many times before when there was still snow on the ground and only the southern section was open. I prefer it in the spring when there is still snow to give it contrast. Without the snow the place looks mostly drab and without definition. Still beautiful just not as picture perfect. Loved that even though this was the Friday before a long weekend, the place was nearly empty and the skies were blue. We lucked out that there was no smoke the day we were there. Attended one of the Ranger talk and even with that, it took us less than 1/2 day. Also checked out a display area in the old lodge - - - Beautiful","September 1, 2018",Love that it is hardly accessible,324,Canada,4

Crater Lake National Park,Words can't describe how beautiful this place is when you see it in person. It is definitely something you won't ever forget. We paid $25 for 3 people in a car. The West Rim Road has been recently repaved. We visited on a Sunday and the paving trucks were parked off the roads. Hopefully they aren't too disruptive during the weekdays. The East Rim Road has not been paved as of this review. There are plenty of overlooks to park and see the beautiful scenery. And a lot of decent parking at each. The Steele visitor Center was small but informative and the 22 minute movie was interesting. Ranger Mike was very helpful and full of great information. I could tell he was really good with kids as I heard him talking to a family with young children. I would recommend to leave your dog at home - although they are allowed in many areas and on many trails - I think it's a bit of a risk. LOTS of tame chipmunks within the dog's view and I could imagine that one or two get away from their people every now and then. I would be too nervous with the rough terrain in which they could get into trouble. We did get lucky as far as the wildfire smoke. Less than a week before they had cancelled the boat tours for 2 days and the view from the rim was barely there. So if you check in advance and if you are flexible on your days then you might be as lucky as us. But even if you are there on a hazy day or a cloudy day - enjoy nature and hopefully it will still be a memorable trip.,"August 30, 2018",GORGEOUS IN PERSON,98,"Weddington, North Carolina",5

Crater Lake National Park,Well its a bad year for smoke...not the parks fault. Spent 3 nights at Crater Lake and managed to do most of the activities we wanted to. Fortunately our trip to Wizard Island was not cancelled but many others were because of smoke. We cancelled our Mt Scott hike becaise of the smoke but we did all the smaller lower trails instead. It still worked out. Mother nature did have a sense of humor though...the smoke lifted for a few hours just before we left so we got a quick view of perfection.

Crater Lake National Park,"Although the park is not responsible for the smoke obstructing the view of the lake, they could do a better job of alerting visitors to the conditions on their website. There are also some trails in the park that are hard to find due to lack of signage. Our favorite hikes were Annie Creek (not marked but located behind the Mazama Village campgrounds - park at D15) and Pinnacles Trail. The Annie Creek Loop Trail runs along the rim of the canyon and then along the creek with beautiful views of the creek (allow 1.5-2 hours). Pinnacles was mostly flat and had amazing views of the Pinnacles. This trail is not a loop; it dead-ends at the edge of the park (trail continues but no signage as to what it is - maybe a spur of the Pacific Crest Trail?) Godfrey Glen was very dusty due to trail maintenance. On a clear day, the Sinnott Overlook provides a great view of Wizard Island.","August 23, 2018",Need Better Communication,149,"West Chester, Pennsylvania",3

Unfortunately we picked a time when wildfires cast a haze across the lake, but we have been previously and enjoyed the unique views of this park. The traveled portion of the park is fairly small and can be seen pretty easily in a full day, with perhaps a second one called for if you really enjoy hiking, or want to spend long periods simply relaxing and taking in the view. Our family really enjoyed the 20ish minutes movie at the main Visitor Center which showed how the park/lake was created, including interesting information and ""pictures"" of the previous Mount Mazama.","August 21, 2018",Beautiful and unique,396,"Portland, Oregon",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We loved our time at Crater Lake, despite the smoke from CA fires! We spent two nights at the lodge, and I think that enhanced the experience. We came in late afternoon and couldn't see across the lake but we checked into the lodge, walked around the rim a little, then had a great dinner in the lodge restaurant. The next morning we were thrilled to look out the window and see the entire lake clearly. We ran downstairs on the patio to catch the sunrise and drink a hot drink in the rocking chairs! That day we bought sandwiches for lunch, then drove from the lodge around the East Rim drive, taking in the different pull outs and views. We hiked down Cleetwood Cove a mile to the boat dock. We did the boat tour and really enjoyed the history and sights, including the Old Man on the lake! Afterwards, we were so hot, we did the jumping rock with about 20 others who had gathered to swim in the lake. It was really a lot of fun! We went straight to an early dinner at Annie Creek, then back at the lodge we enjoyed dessert on the patio. The next morning was hazy, but we were checking out at 11 a.m. anyway. We enjoyed the Stinnott Memorial Overlook and museum that day. Last stop, besides the Village gift shop, was to go see the Pinnacles. Definitely worth seeing! Maybe it was because of the haze or maybe because it was mid-August, but we didn't feel like it was crowded and loved it. NOTE: I got one night at the lodge 3 months in advance, then checked back daily for the 2nd night and finally got a 2nd night reservation there. Also we bought the boat tickets in advance online.","August 21, 2018",Loved this smaller National Park experience!,202,"edmond, oklahoma",5

I can’t help my eyes moisten as I feel – “If this is not heaven, then what is?” These were moments frozen in time; moments that the Universe took 4.5 billion years to present to you to savor; moments that I wished would never end. Crater Lake at Oregon, U.S.A. has this timeless and ethereal quality about it.","August 6, 2018","If this isn't heaven, then what is?",24,"Mumbai, India",5

However, the park was beautiful and we did snatch a few glimpses of the lake, from Rim Village and Watchman Overlook. Given the incredible work of the firefighters and the terrible events further south in California in would be wrong to complain, but even early in the day (around 9:30) visibility was very poor, and the trolley tours were canceled for the day.

The east rim entrance is only open in the summer time and the full loop is open from early July to late October.

Crater Lake National Park,"This had been on my bucket list for years and it lived up to my expectations in every way.The water is crystal clear and yes you can swim in it and the view from the top practically takes your breath away. You can definitely tell why the Native Americans viewed this as a spiritual place.There's more to see than just the lake as well and there our numerous other hikes that allow you to experience the forest. We walked to Paikini Falls which is only about a mile from the road but felt very private as there was only a few other people there when we were.We were expecting the hike down to the lake to be intense but it's smooth,not rocky and also has resting benches though we didn't need them as I'd say anyone of moderate fitness should have no issues.Now for the negatives first and foremost being the road which obviously borders a precipice yet has no guard rails making it scary in Summer and I imagine nearly suicidal in Winter. The turnoffs aren't marked in advance so we often didn't notice we'd reached our turnoff until we were actually at it and in the case of Paikini Falls it wasn't listed on the sign at the entry at all.None of this distracts from what must be one of the most incredible places in America.","July 30, 2018",Awe Inspiring,15,,5

Crater Lake National Park,"Went to Crater Lake in July 2018. We went to both visitor centers, both gift stores and ate at the Rim Village grab and go cafe as well as dinner at the lodge. We went to every look out (including to star gaze and see the milky way around 11pm at the cloud cap overlook) and hiked the Watchmen's overlook, Discovery trail, Pinnacles, Sun Notch and Cleetwood Cove. All worth it except Cleetwood cove. The trail is VERY steep to get back up but my disappointment is not over the hike itself but you're attacked by swarms of mosquitos and once at the bottom it's very rocky and crammed with lots of people trying to swim in a very small area. Not at all serene. We didn't do the boat tour but this is where you'd access this. But everything else....well worth it! Don't cut yourself short. We did 3 very well spent days here and enjoyed almost every moment. The kids also did the junior ranger program and learned a lot. One tip....the main throng of tourists seem to filter out after 5 or 6pm. So we learned this and on days 2 and 3 we ate a late lunch, did the park mainly between 4 and 8:30 and then ate a late dinner. Also try to take in the park at night. Well worth it but go slow.

The lake was glowing in a beautiful hue that was amazing.Another visitor commented the view about forty feet away was even better! My response was "" how can it be even better""? The road is rough and winding in spots, and they repaved the north end so a small portion is really nice. Some view points require a little hike and the high altitude can add a bit to the challenge.

Prior to that we relaxed and enjoyed the views. The color of the water here is the most amazing cobalt blue. We have seen beautifully colored glacial fed lakes before but have never seen a color like this (this is not a glacially fed lake). The color rivals even the Caribbean in our opinion.

The sky was beautifully blue, the water in the lake even bluer and there were still large patches of snow around the edges of the lake to make for some great photos.

We’ve been to a bunch in the past month and I didn’t have high hopes we would see any thing we hadn’t already. I was wrong! The color of the water is really indescribable. We had fun trekking down to the water, in the one spot that’s allowed. My boys fished and caught 2 salmon. They also swam. It was a difficult hike back up, so be prepared.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater lake itself is bucket-list worthy. The lake is beautiful! But the current boat tour operators have a terrible system. Our Experience : We booked the Wizard Island shuttle 3 months before our trip. The operators called us a day before our trip and informed that wizard island shuttle boats have developed a mechanical failure. So our boat tour was CANCELLED. Then they informed us that they were putting us on the standard lake tour which starts 30 mins later instead. They said we were ""lucky"" to get a replacement tour and that the lake tour is more expensive than then wizard island tour. We go to the lake and the good folk at the ticket counter inform us that the callers did not update the manifest in their system about our changed schedule. So we cant go on any tour. We were baffled. They eventually put us on another lake tour that starts an hour later. We were told we were ""lucky"" to get this. We did end up going on that tour. However, the tour operators are incompetent. The boats are old. They have a poor system in place with lack of communication between their own people. Refunds are useless when people drive 100s of miles to get to the lake. I also dont see how I am ""lucky"" to be on a boat tour that I PAID for. Lack of competition leads to poor service. Multiple operators should operate at the same time and compete for tourists.","July 15, 2018",Great place. The boat tour operators have a terrible reservation system,1,,3
Crater Lake National Park,This is a beautiful lake. We drove around the lake and got out at overlooks for great picture opportunities. We hiked one of the trails to get a better view and the trail was great. It was challenging as we were hiking up the surrounding mountainous area.

The first day we did the trolley tour and our driver and tour guide (Charlie and Rick I believe) we're so great! The views are amazing. The second day we came to hike Mt. Scott which was an amazing experience as well. The only bad part about our two days here was on the 2nd day when we tried to pay the $25 admission charge, my husband handed the young woman working a $50 and she seemed to have snapped at him saying they just opened and she couldn't break that bill and offered no alternative (such as if we had a credit card on us). It was her tone that through us off. We then asked her to verify the parking for Mt. Scott and she handed us a newsletter and said she didn't know but agreed with us when we said it was on east rim drive.

Crater Lake National Park,"We love visiting National Parks and Crater Lake was one we have been wanting to do for quite some time. We entered from the North. We made our way down to the Rim Village Visitor Center. In this area there is a gift shop, a snack bar, visitor information and the lodge. We always enjoy walking through the lodges because they are so beautiful. This one was no exception.The Sinnott Memorial Overlook in this area is really neat. It is a short walk down and there are some stairs but it is a relatively easy walk. There is a very cool overlook with a roof and a museum behind it. It gives a very pretty view of the lake.Also, from the Rim Village Visitor you can opt to take the bus tour around the lake and not have to worry about the driving.We than begin our drive around the lake. We chose to travel clockwise. There is quite a bit of construction going on and we had to wait at some spots. The waits were relatively short. All around the lake the are pull-offs and overlooks. Every angle is gorgeous. The water is so blue.The only way to touch the water is to hike down the Cleetwood Cove Trail. This is a 1.1 mile down hike and then you need to return the same 1.1 mile, but it is all uphill. This is the trail you would take if you want to do a boat ride on the lake. However, we learned that the boats generally only run in July and August.There is an 8 mile offshoot road to a section called the Pinnacles. This is well worth the drive. The Pinnacles are very cool to see. You can see them from an overlook or you can take a hike down to them if time permits.We really loved Crater Lake!","July 11, 2018",Gorgeous!,201,"Bethlehem, Pennsylvania",5

We were on a mission to see as many NPs as we could in each northwestern state. This one, was a surprise. It is the most beautiful blue and there were few clouds to reflect in the water so it was an incredible blue hue. There are several hiking paths to gain a different perspective and several different viewing points that you can drive to as well. It is a volcano within a volcano and just as the name implies it is a crater within a volcano. There was still some snow on the ground even in July. Access is easy from the parking lot and the ground is mostly even without any exertion to view the lake. At the viewing area the Park Rangers called the Corral bc it hand some wooden fencing, you can see beautiful turquoise or emerald color at the base of the small volcano in the lake. There is a visitor center and you can step out the rear door for beautiful views. I did not pay much attention to lodging but I do think it is available there.

Crater Lake National Park,"My husband and I went on a West Coast trip starting in CA and ending in OR. On our way to Portland, we stopped at Crater Lake National Park. Neither of us had been there and the reviews, pictures, National Park Service (NPS) website all pointed to this being an amazing, serene, beautiful, rustic natural phenomenon: a volcanic crater which collapsed on itself and is now filled with the bluest, clearest water you’ve ever seen. The lake, the view, the park were all beautiful and any pictures you’ll see won’t do it justice. Unfortunately, the positives stop there. We were planning to stay two nights on our way to Portland. The first day we arrived, we checked with the visitor center to reserve tickets for the boat ride on the lake which is one of the highlights of the park. The park representative nonchalantly told us all the boats were broken <shrug>, so we were unable to book a boat ride. End of story. The main reason we had stopped at Crater Lake was to sail on a boat in the mouth of a volcano. Since this was a bust, we regrouped, and the next day we decided to spend the majority of our time hiking, down to the lake, to water falls, to see volcanic spires, etc. We got back to the only lodge that you can stay in at the park, hydrated at the bar, then went to our rooms to freshen up but the water was not working. We went to the front desk to inquire and again, very nonchalantly, very unapologetically, they told us the water wasn’t working for us as well as everyone else in the hotel and dinner service was also canceled. They had no ETA on when the water would return or what they were doing about it. The only other place within the park to eat was a gift shop, which had run out of sandwiches that morning anyway. Needless to say, we had to cut our trip short, leave the park a day early and make an additional, unplanned stop on our way to Portland. In short, other than hiking and looking at the crater lake, and the minimal chance at a boat ride, there is not much to do there and without food or water, stay at your own risk. The icing on the cake for us was the poor customer service from the park and lodge employees (Zanterra). If they, at any point, felt some sort of empathy towards their customers, it might’ve made the situation a tad bit palatable. Bottom line, if you’re going to stay at Crater Lake, the best idea may be to camp and bring your own amenities. P.S. We didn’t see much wildlife either.","July 7, 2018",Beautiful Location - Everything Else Not So Great,6,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",2

You can also take boat rides out to Wizard island in the middle of the lake. I believe there are hiking trails on the island and one which goes to the top of wizard Island. You can be dropped off early and picked up later in the day. They also have a trolley tour which takes you around the rim of the lake. I believe the lake itself is supposed to be one of the deepest freestanding lakes in the world. Our time consisted mainly of short walks driving around the lake and spending time at the lodge.

If you go this time, prepare accordingly...TONS OF SNOW. In some places, if you fell through the snow it was up to your hip, but the view makes it all worth it. I stood their in awe and soaked it all in. We showed up at just the right time for the fog to clear and had a picture perfect view of the lake.

Crater Lake National Park,"We came in early June so only part of the road around Crater Lake was open. It would have been amazing if we would have been able to travel around the entire lake and hike down the Cleetwood Cove Trail and touched the water. It was a once in a lifetime visit for sure. The lake is beautiful and the surroundings are well kept and accessible. The views we had on a beautiful sunny day were sparkling. We were very happy to have made the trek down to southern Oregon to see this National Park.

Crater Lake National Park,My husband and I are doing a road trip around the western half of the USA and this was on our list from the start. We bought an annual pass to get into all of the national parks and have already got our money’s worth back. We arrived early and the National Park was empty. Some of the roads were closed because of adverse weather conditions so we decided to drive around the crater of the volcano. The reflective water is crazy beautiful and I was standing in awe not believing what I was looking at. It was phenomenal. There were a few trails that were closed but a lot remained open so my husband and I did a few easy ones just to say we’d done one. The information sites are very informative and there are plenty of rangers to ask if you have questions. ,"June 9, 2018",One of the smaller national parks but definitely one of the most beautiful,49,"Gateshead, United Kingdom",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We visited Crater Lake on June 1st while there was still snow on the ground to add colorful contrasts to this beautiful area. On this date, hiking options were minimal and the East Rim was closed. But what I noticed most was how this awe-inspiring vista of pristine water and surrounding caldera cast a subdued serenity over the tourists. People conversed in quiet tones so as to not disturb the moment as we viewed this gem of nature. I urge any visitor to Crater Lake to take the time to visit the Visitor's Center and view the film about the forces that created this wonderful national treasure.","June 4, 2018",Crater Lake - Subdued Serenity,75,"Tooele, Utah",5

Crater Lake National Park,"Much of the park was closed or just opening up when we visited on May 22, 2018. Many roads, hiking trails, interpretive centers and other park offices were still yet to open. The road was open to Rim Village, our destination. We were just stopping off at the vistas to get the obvious photo op's. After a few of those stops we ended up next to the lodge for a few more photo op's. From there we stopped at the Rim Village concession for snacks, drinks and souvenir's. Parking was ok at the vistas but at capacity when we hit the concession stand. And crowds for this time of year are limited compared to others. Weather was great the day we visited. Light cloud, mostly clear and visibility was perfect to see the whole lake. There was still much snow covering around the lake so it gave a beautiful in between season view to an already miraculous view. Like it needed any help, right! Saw only the slightest fraction of the lake on this trip, but I look forward to seeing more in the future.","June 2, 2018",Sweeping Panoramas,113,"Hayward, California",5
Crater Lake National Park,"The views are out of this world. To learn about the history makes you even more in awe of the lake. The interpretive center is great and has a lot of information and interesting facts about it. There is a boat ride that you can take (although we went to early this trip) that takes you around the lake. The trail to get to the bottom is easy going down but be prepared! It's steep hill all the way up with multiple switchbacks. The view is simply breathtaking and you have multiple areas to stop and see it. The rim road is very narrow so drive very carefully and SLOW. It may not be suited for those who get vertigo very easily or stress out driving on steep and narrow roads with drops on the side. It's also very high up (I think around 7,500 ft) so those with breathing problems may find it difficult to breath easily that high. But if you can, it is well worth the trip.","June 1, 2018",Very awe inspiring and simply beautifull.,19,,5

Crater Lake National Park,"We visited for an afternoon on May 20th, a Sunday, so it was a little busier than normal for that time of year I guess. We knew the whole park wouldn't be accessible but weren't sure what was open or not, and what the hiking conditions would be. Our first stop therefore was the visitor centre which had a good selection of items for sale, plus the girl I asked for information was very helpful on suggesting where we could go in the time time we had.We headed up to the cafe area where there was a huge gift shop and a small overpriced cafe ($10) for a sandwich. We parked the car and headed off towards Discovery Point along the rim. There was still a lot of snow on the ground but we managed to pick our way along the trail pretty easily. Most people seemed to be walking up and down the road and were missing out on all the awesome views from the edge of the rim. We carried on for a little while after Discovery Point but we'd stopped for that many photos that time was getting away from us so we headed back to the parking lot via the road where the going was much easier.The cafe may have been over priced but the Lodge's restaurant was crazy - 5 Ryvita type thins and a little dollop of cheese for $13. The view from the balcony overlooking the lake is great though.We were lucky with the weather and had a nice blue sky white fluffy cloud afternoon until 5 minutes after we were leaving when it absolutely tipped it down.","May 30, 2018",Truly stunning scenery,185,Scarborough,5
Crater Lake National Park,"As we approached Crater Lake, the ground had more and more snow, and you could feel the air change. It looked so pretty with the snow and pine trees, as we climbed up the approach road there was more and more snow. We stopped at the first opportunity to view the lake, and were taken aback with its beauty. What once was a volcano, erupted a couple of thousand years ago, had formed a huge steep crater, and the centre was filled with blue water from the snow. We then headed to our cabin for the next couple of nights, along the road which was not only narrow, but with sheer drops at the side which had my stomach turning over.Calling at the visitor centre en route we found that the largest part of the rim road with circles the crater was still closed because of the snow, as were most of the walking trails, which was a blow as we had looked forward to both.Up early this morning we headed straight for the lake. We were rewarded with stupendous reflections of the crater in the still waters it was difficult to take it all in. We walked as far as we could round the rim, crunching through the snow, and paddling in the water running off the melting snow.Taking the car further round we found a path that took us further around the rim which was a beautiful path in its own right, right on the rim of the crater and gave us more spectacular views of the lake, although the winds were now rippling the surface of the water and the reflections disappearing.","May 29, 2018",Jaw dropping scenery,127,"Bolton, United Kingdom",5

As with anything do your homework first understand what time of year to come, what is open, what is closed, but the fire comes in August probably not the best month. Where the current rate gear set your expectations. The views alone are worth it even if you don’t do the Cleetwood hike ( which is difficult). Understand that you can’t just come here and get on the boat on the month but it’s open you have to have some forethought and make a reservation before coming.Been here multiple times and last summer finally got the nerve up to jump off the cliff into the water and it was absolutely fantastic and something to check off my bucket list.","May 20, 2018",So magical but do your homework,12,"Boynton Beach, Florida",5

Crater Lake National Park,"Well worth the drive to get there. Park fee is $25 or free with a NP Pass. Get in early or you’ll end up queuing for quite some time. This early there isn’t much open so don’t expect any tours or ranger guided events. The visitor information and the Rim Village Cafe & Gift Shop are open but food options are very limited. Check before you go as the weather may change quickly and roads may become covered in snow again. The ring road is still closed this early in the year so you can’t really drive around all that much. On a perfect day like we had, the view across the lake is truly amazing and the white piles of snow just add to the whole picture. Check out the movie at the visitor center. It takes just 20 minutes and will give you an idea of how the lake came to be.Highly recommended!","May 13, 2018",Stunning even this early in the year,46,,5

The views of the lake are spectacular!If you are going to visit, I would encourage you to read up on the Park before you go. Take the time to prepare for the trip. You will be glad you did.Some things to think about:Try to visit the lake on a clear day. On stormy days the lake may be covered by clouds.Prepare for the weather:- make sure you are dressed properly for the cold, or the hot weather- go to the Park’s website and check the webcam. It will show you a view of the lake- consider camping, hiking, snow shoeing ... and prepare for it- bring binoculars and a camera.Prepare to be amazed.","April 21, 2018",This is an incredible place to visit!,129,"Surrey, Canada",5

Crater Lake National Park,"Wow.....I can't believe that it took me 59 years to get here. What a natural masterpiece. As we climbed in elevation, and saw a little more snow on the road side, my heart beat a little more quickly. Finally we got to the turn-off to enter the park. There was probably 6-7 feet of snow on the ground. We got to the top and weren't disappointed. The visibility was incredible (make sure that you check the webcams before making the 1 1/2 hour drive). Wizard Island and the Ghost Ship were in plain site and the colors of everything were spectacular. Also, remember that the elevation is a little over 7,000 feet up and the air is a little thinner; don't over-do it!While you're there, you have to go into the gift shop. Just because.

And the only area you can visit is the Visitor Center and the Rim Village Café. But seeing the view of the lake sheathed in snow makes limited access well worth the drive. You should check the weather and road condition reports before heading up. The first day we were going to go the high temperature was only 27 degrees with a serious wind chill factor. The very next day it was 40 degrees with very little wind. Crater Lake is awesome in summer and there is certainly much more to do, (take the trolley around the Lake in summer), but the winter scene is truly beautiful.

However the next day, the wind direction changed so we were able to see the amazing blues of the lake! I recommend driving Rim drive one way at sunset, and then the opposite way the next time you drive up there. Camped in Mazam village. Cold, snowy, but worth it! Be prepared for the weather. Check to be sure the water restrictions are off too. We had a few gallons of water with but didn't' know about that! Hiked Garfield, Cleetwood and around the look out.

We spent about 3 hours there and would have spent more if most of the road wasn't snowed in. We went in June so there was still much snow but didn't stop us from being able to see the lake, hike around, and get great pics from many viewpoints. The gift shop and café were open.

Definitely drive around the full route (if it's open -- we couldn't access the far western edge due to wildfire activity) and stop at various viewpoints to really get a sense of the place. Bring your lunch, or stop at the restaurant/cafe for a bite to eat. Plenty here to enjoy for a full day, or over several days.

The rim drive has many places to pull out and enjoy the beauty. There are limited places to sleep and eat. If you plan on spending the night here, it's probably wise to make sure you have a reservation.

Crater Lake National Park,"We arrived just as a fire had started days before so our view of the lake was somewhat impeded but it was all part of the experience. The campground itself is well organized and the bathrooms are clean. It did get quite cold in the tent even though it was august so be prepared for that. The key sights were quite busy but the rim road is long enough that you can always find a spot that is quieter to enjoy a snack or lunch. The hike down to the lake is well with it (but beware it is a hike not a walk, especially on the way back!). The best part was getting an eye level perspective of the lake (along with a cool swim). We loved it and would love to come back to see it in the winter as well. ","December 6, 2017",Top notch experience ,6,"Vancouver, Canada",5

The informational signs were very good, providing facts about depth, clarity, and wildlife.There's a visitor's center here, but the food is overpriced and not that great, although there are a few interesting souvenirs in the gift shop.The perimeter drive wasn't allowed then, nor was the northern entrance open—preventing us from taking a shorter route to Eugene later.And don't fail to stop, as you head north east, at the Natural Bridge and the Rogue River Gorge.

No matter what your level of physical fitness, you can enjoy the scenery of this natural beauty! The perimeter drive has many pull-offs for viewing the lake and several of them have tourist information boards to make you aware of special features. We went on a weekday in October so there wasn't a ton of traffic, but there was still a fair bit of people around. Be sure to bring a camera and perhaps binoculars. Though it was the start of October, there was a definite chill in the air and the wind was strong. My husband and I were wearing sweatshirts, jeans, heavy socks, and scarves and we were comfortable. We drove the entire perimeter and pulled into nearly every observation point to take in the view, walk around, and take photos, so the full drive took us 2 1/2 hours at a VERY leisurely pace. The little village was closed when we were there, so if you are visiting in the off-season be sure to pack any snacks or other items you might need and fill your gas tank before you start your trip here. It didn't seem like there were any stores or gas stations anywhere nearby. If you are going to visit Oregon, be sure to put this on the top of your ""to do"" list!

We pulled over and took photos from various points. It still had remnants of a snow that occurred the prior week but we were thankful that it was a clear, cold, and windy day but we were able to see the gorgeous blue water.

We drove around the rim mainly because I wanted to be able to get out my car when I wanted, not just the bus stops. Bus ride was not expensive though, and they do let you out at some great places for pics! (My friend had sone the bus tour before). The waterfall was soso. I've seen much better. I didn't get to do the trails this day, but will next time! This is something I think most everyone would love! I flew into Medford and my friend drove me here. It probably took us around 1.5 to 2 hours. Also stop at Natural Bridge on your way back in - you will not regret it! restaurants were closed when we went in October.

We were able to visit all of the park outside the rim drive & we did the rim drive except for a 6 mile stretch of the west rim drive that was closed for construction. We were able to see most of the crater thru the fog, but the roads were starting to get slick when we left. It would have been nice to see all of the lake, but the snow gave it another dimension.

At 12:30p, the temp was 35 and with the wind, the real feel was 28, so make sure you prepare with layers!At Rim Village, there is a small cafe and a large gift shop, with small bathrooms (2 stalls for women, so plan ahead for that too). But the show is walking the path along the rim. Simply amazing! We only spent about an hour at the Rim, but we both felt it was well worth the trip, even if you don’t have time to hike or even drive further on the West Rim Rd. Oh, and if you’re short on time like we were, don’t feel like you have to stop at visitors center on your way to Rim.

This is a place that you have to visit in person in order to appreciate it. One hint for everyone, one of the best places to get the ultimate shot is at the Sinnott Memorial that is behind the Rim Village Visitor center. The problem is that while there are plenty of signs pointing you in the right direction, you still might not be able to find it. The visitor center itself is quite small and unmarked. We walked right in front of it and missed it. Most people think that the Rim Village Cafe is the visitors center and it's not. Use google maps in satellite view to see where it is at.

Crater Lake National Park,"September 2, 2017 - We drove by Crater Lake from Bend on the way to Klamath Falls. It was a sunny day at Bend but we did hear that the highway to Crater Lake might be closed because of forest fires. When we got to the junction to turn onto the highway going to Crater Lake, we did not see any barriers so we turned and kept going. The highway was open to Crater Lake so we turned to drive to the Lake.We have a senior National Park pass that was accepted by the ranger at the entrance to the Lake area. Then, we proceeded to drive from the North part of the Lake around the Western side South to the Crater Lake Lodge and visitors center. We stopped at several overlooks along the way and saw that the Lake was clouded with smoke from the various forest fires in the area. Still, it was pretty.We continued around the Lake on Crater Rim Road to the visitors center and after lunch, we continued our drive around the Lake. Since we wanted to go out of the South entrance and continue to Klamath Falls, we drove by some of the same overlooks we had stopped at earlier. The smoke had cleared some and it was a slightly better view.The various smoke views of the ""Phantom Ship"" made it look like it was part of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie.

This year we were able to.I can say nothing more than the other folks have. It's magnificent! And awe inspiring.From our trip I suggest: take the Rim Drive (and stop at ALL the pull-outs. You'll probably do this only once so make the most of it. And the Lake changes from different vantage points); do the Visitor Center (including the video. Goes without saying); if you have a sandwich at the Rim Café, go upstairs and sit in the chairs by the windows overlooking the lake (almost no one does. The upstairs was almost empty while the downstairs was crazy); stay at the Lodge (if they are full, keep trying on their Web site every day. That's what I did and got two nights in a room overlooking the Lake); stop by Vidae Falls (small falls, but beautiful cascading down the hillside); attend a Ranger talk (ours was in the Lodge Great Room and was most enjoyable); have a drink in the Lodge Great Room (the dining room is a bit pricy. There's a fireplace close to the check-in desk that's often vacant. And the balcony is always great. A bit cold when we were there.).I wished we had gone to the Pinnacles.

There were some roadworks happening on the west rim drive and it was stated as being closed on the website, however, when we arrived it was open (albeit loose gravelled) and we managed to get all the way around but then it did get closed as we returned to the hotel later, due to the proximity of the forest fires. Lots of photo ops and chances to gaze at the clear blue waters. We would enjoy a longer stay to go down to the cove and go out on the water itself for a different perspective.

I was amazed at the spectacular scenery,the deep blue of the lake's water and the crisp mountain air. Do read about Mt. Mazama and the lake's dramatic geological history to find out how one of this hemisphere's deepest lakes was created. It's truly a sight to behold and there are numerous viewpoints along the rim road to appreciate the impressive vistas. Do visit the Crater Lake Lodge and if possible try to spend at least one night there,though somewhat expensive it will fully enhance your Crater Lake experience!

Crater Lake National Park,"We recently spent 8 days in Bend, visiting our son who lives in the area. We took him and his roomie to Crater Lake for a day trip, and it was the highlight of our visit. Out visit took longer than it should have, as the north entrance to the park was closed because of forest fires (necessitating a trip to the south entrance). Despite that, it was an awesome experience, enjoyed by two 60-somethings, our 33 year old son, and his 20-something roommate. The lake is breathtaking -- the bluest color imaginable. While there we drove around the entire lake (by late in the day the road had re-opened) with many stops along the way to enjoy the fabulous views. Smoke from the forest fires filled the caldera while we were there, which served to enhance the colors of the setting sun.

Crater Lake National Park,"I have been wanting to come to Crater Lake National Park since the days when I was a newspaper editor and reporter and one day ask one of the nation's top travel writers: What is the most beautiful place you have ever visited? His answer? Crater Lake National Park.It took me a few years but I can completely see why he loved this park so much. The water is intensely blue, almost surreal. The setting is incredibly dramatic, with giant rim walls soaring skyward, and the imposing Wizard Island set against that backdrop.Visiting the park you get all those wonderful views, but along the way you learn about the science and history of the park, and why it is such an incredible natural wonder. Just consider: the water in the lake is some of the purest water in the world, and at 1943 feet deep it is the deepest lake in the U.S. There is more water in the lake than in all the other lakes of Oregon combined.I learned all that and more by taking the terrific ranger-led Rim Drive Trolley Tour. Ranger Michelle did a wonderful job of telling us all about the many wonderful aspects of the park. One huge advantage of taking the trolley tour is that it is currently the only way to see the entire rim. The West Rim is closed for construction, so if you want to see this beautiful place from every direction you simply must take the tour.","September 27, 2017",Spectacular Natural Beauty: Don't Miss the Rim Drive Trolley Tour,84,"Orange County, California",5

Crater Lake National Park,"there was smoke (from local fires) when we were there too, but it did not have much impact on our views and experience in August. Weather was hot, but lake was very cold. I was expecting that because you can see snow throughout the park and in spots around the lake. but do not let that keep you from jumping in. Water felt very clean and refreshing. We spent more than an hour in the water. I even jumped of the rock/cliff (about as high as a high dive), which was fun. There were a bunch of younger kids jumping in, so the crowd enjoyed an old man joining the fun. There is only one trail going down to the water. It is very steep, but a nice wide trail. It only took about 20 min for us to reach the lake (with wife and 4 younger kids). I had heard horror stories about the hike back up. Even people leaving the trail as we started down said it took them 2 hours to ascend. Don't get me wrong, it is steep, but took us only about 45 min (and part of that was in my water shoes), so not too bad. It was well worth the walk. The parking lot was dirt, but it looked like they are creating a new, paved lot there. We also drove around the rim, which has more spectacular views.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake was formed 7,700 years ago by the collapse of a volcanic mountain. It is five miles across and contains over one trillion gallons of water.

Crater Lake National Park,"This is my third visit, but my wife's first visit to Crater Lake. It is a spectacular beautiful lake. Unfortunately on this visit there was a forest fire nearby. The haze from the smoke obscured the view to the point we could only see less than half of the lake.Even with the smoke the crowds of tourist was enormous. It was very difficult to find a place to park.If possible, I would avoid the peak summer months to visit.","September 13, 2017","Spectacular lake, too bad there was a fire nearby",41,"San Francisco, California",4
Crater Lake National Park,"The Crater is truly enormous, you get a great view of its outer wall from the Visitor Center. There are roads all round the rim, from which hiking trails of varying difficulty branch off. The only access to the water itself is down the Cleetwood Cove Trail, a one-mile switchback that descends 700 feet. Bear in mind that it’s 700 feet back up again, and since the trail is south-facing it got very hot in the afternoon. The park calls this trail “strenuous”, but hikers of all ages seemed to be managing it. At the bottom we watched people swimming in the lake, but they had to be careful: an East Coast park would have lifeguards, lane markers to define the swim area, and sand to launch yourself from. Here there are just jagged rocks. This did not stop the more adventurous youth from launching themselves from rocks ten feet above the water, but I’d recommend at least wearing water shoes. It’s not a place for kiddies.The Cove is also the place our boat tour started from. This was the high point of our trip, since not only was it interesting in its own right, lasting 2 hours with a continuous commentary by the ranger, but it was also the only way that day to see the sides of the crater, since the smoke from forest fires obscured most of the view from up on the rim. The boat was able to sail really close to the shore, at one point looping around so closely to the Phantom Ship that we could almost touch it. But make sure you book a boat ride long in advance: they only hold 30 people, and the day we were there only one boat was able to operate, so there were only two rides the whole day.Most National Parks are pretty predictable, you can expect to just turn up and see whatever you want to see. Crater Lake is not like that however, due to snow, smoke, and construction. You must plan ahead!After the boat ride we attended a talk in the Lodge given by a park ranger. “There are just three seasons here at Crater Lake National Park,” she said. “Snow Season, Mosquito Season, and Smoke Season!” The joke was a bit too close to the bone, as outside smoke was still filling the crater, prevented us from seeing Wizard Island, never mind the rim on the other side of the lake. In 2017 a zone of high pressure air over the West had given us a three week vacation without a drop of rain, but at a cost of wildfires all over Oregon. In fact the previous day we had seen from the top of the Watchman a wildfire right there in the park, barely a mile from the West Rim Road.So when is Mosquito Season? Well Snow Season drags on longer than you might expect. In 2017 the Park’s web site shows that the West Rim Drive didn’t open till June 22, and the East Rim Drive wasn’t open till July 21! This was a bit later than usual, but the East Rim is always later, so on average you won’t be able to count on touring the whole park till mid-July. Then by the middle of August, the dry summer started triggering forest fires. As I write this it’s mid-September and the same web site is showing that: the North Entrance is closed completely due to fire fighting activity; and Mazama Village on the south side may have to be evacuated. We visited at the end of August for three days. On only one of those days did we get a clear view of Wizard Island from the Lodge! The other two days we could barely make out the outline of the far rim.Conclusion: if you want to see the whole rim, visit between mid-July and mid-August. If you want to see the lake in pristine condition, and are content to view it only from the Lodge, then go in Snow Season. Actually in winter you can snowshoe and snowmobile further afield, but I’m writing this for car-based tourists like myself.Another concern is road repairs. Construction crews have the same short summer season to repair the roads, so when they get started, they take over the whole road. During our visit a three-mile stretch of the West Rim Road was being repaired, and work on this scale is more than what a flagman with a STOP/SLOW sign can handle. Instead we had to line up in a convoy and follow a pilot truck who navigated us through the heavy equipment, piles of gravel, and other obstacles that are scattered all over the road being repaired. When we reached the end of construction we were free to proceed, as the pilot truck made a U-turn and started taking a convoy the other way. If you just miss a convoy going your way, you’ll have to wait 30 minutes for the next one. That is, if there is a convoy. Right now the same web site shows the West Rim Road is closed to traffic all week, and only open weekends.Please don’t let me put you off from going: it’s truly a spectacular sight, even though on our trip we never saw any blue water, and had to content ourselves with a picture book from the gift shop. But be sure to check out the conditions beforehand: it's a long journey to get there, and $30 per car to get in!","September 13, 2017",Go in Mosquito Season!,90,"Rockland County, New York",4

It's a great place to stop whether you have a day or a week to spend. In just a couple days, we got to do a nice sampling of everything the park has to offer - doing the whole Rim Drive, hiking Cleetwood Cove Trail and taking a chilly swim in the lake, hiking up to the top of Mount Scott (make sure you've adjusted to the altitude sufficiently first!), took a number of short trails (Castle Crest for amazing wildflowers, Sun Notch for a beautiful view of Phantom Ship Island), and picnicked at one of the many scenic overlooks. With road construction on Rim Drive and two large wildfires in the park, we were not able to have access to all of the trails and evening programs, but it didn't take away from our experience at all.

It was a kind of cool as I didn't fancy the deep blue anyway, but it would be just perfect if the ""fog"" was a little lighter to see the whole shape of the lake. And later I was told it was not fog it was smoke coming from some where, which I first thought was joking as I didn't smell that much of a smoke. But it was and on my way back a scenic park way about an hour away was closed because of fire. A couple days earlier the road to Crater Lake itself was closed for fire, it is a high fire risk area, so better to call the park office just before you go, even there is no proble to reach the lake, you may not be able to see the lake.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake was on our bucket list. When we booked this trip we had on idea there would be fires that would impact our travel plans. We planned to drive across Highway 138 and were looking forward to the beautiful waterfalls. Unfortunately information we received prior to leaving home wasn't correct and we learned not long before getting to the highway that it was closed. We were staying at Chemult, so decided the best route was to drive to Canyonville and take Highway 227 to Highway 62. It was an interesting drive, to say the least.We were concerned about the boat trip we had reserved for August 26, but hoped for the best. We took the trip at noon. As we hiked down the trail, we were relieved to see there was very little smoke obstructing our view. We really enjoyed the tour of the lake. It is beautiful. Our boat captain was great. It truly met our expectations. There were lots of people enjoying the sunny day at Cleetwood Cove, swimming, sunning themselves, and fishing. The hike down isn't bad, but as expected, the hike back up was a bit difficult for me. DD is in much better shape. She was patient with me. It took me about 45 minutes for the hike out. Lots of people were moving slowly on the hike out so I didn't feel so bad.We were very lucky to have such a nice day. We were told the smoke was much worse the previous day. As we left the park from the south to Klamath Falls, we saw firefighters working along the road, although no fires were visible. A couple of days later we saw the south entrance was under a level 1 evacuation order. We were lucky to get to enjoy a full day at Crater Lake. The lake and the drive around the rim is gorgeous.

Crater Lake National Park,"Eek........what a disaster this stay turned out to be! Construction dust was worst than the thick dense smoke. We only stayed two nights @ The Crater Lake Lodge in a beautiful room with a supposedly phenomenal lake view. Hotel was very nice, casual, friendly staff & a delicious dining room where reservations are a must. We ate dinner there both nights - food was outstanding. One of the issues was that the forest fire smoke was so thick you could not breathe nor could you even see the lake out the hotel windows. We left after 48 hrs. We were told this forest fire activity is quite common & takes place most of August & September. Obviously the hotel staff or no one can control or predict a forest fire, that is just unfortunate travel luck.  However, the most upsetting part was that the National Forest Service had torn up 3 miles of roadway to do construction during the month of August which is one of the park's busiest months of the year. The first day this 3 mile stretch was closed for 30 mins @ a time throughout the day & you sat in your car with dust & dirt blowing up as the oncoming traffic passed thru. This 3 mile stretch was so thickened with dirt & dust it was unreal. Your car takes quite a dust & dirt beating! You cannot see out the windows until you exit the park & get to a car wash. It even seeped in through the windows, etc. Park service did not even spray down the road to minimize dust at all. If that wasn't inconvenient enough then the park service decides to close down the entire 3 mile stretch & force all tourists to drive an additional 27 miles out of our way to exit the park. The National Forest Service clearly does not give priority to the revenue producing tourists. Why they cannot tear up & repair smaller sections @ a time does not make sense. Highly recommend you go online & look @ pictures of the lake or order a Crater Lake Book w/ pictures of the pristine water. We'd never visit this park again. Construction dust & forest fire smoke made the trip quite miserable. ","August 28, 2017","CAUTION, ITS NOT REALLY WORTH THE INCONVENIENCE!",27,"Lone Tree, Colorado",2
Crater Lake National Park,"We visited in mid-August. There were many small to mid-size fires burning throughout southern Oregon, and as a result the fall side of the lake was barely visible when we arrived. When we left 2 hours later the visibility had worsened, and we could not see to the other side at all. We learned from the locals that fires are to be expected every August, so you may wish to plan accordingly. Our 'poor' rating reflects the visibility -otherwise this would have been a great place to visit and explore.","August 28, 2017",Expect Limited Visibility,46,Minnesota,2
Crater Lake National Park,"Despite forest fire smoke, we spent the entire day within the park. We entered from the south drove clockwise on the 33 mile Rim Road, Almost immediately, we encountered road construction (the road bed was ripped down to dirt for full replacement), While the park ranger mentioned road work, we didn't expect to wait 30 minutes for a pilot pickup to guide us through. It would have been far better to go east, stop at the various markers and retrace our steps from Cleetwood Cove. Although we couldn't book a boat tour (at least one boat was out of commission), we decided to walk the strenuous Cleetwood Cove Trail so my friend could swim in the lake. Down was easy (35 minutes). Up was much tougher (1 hour 10 minutes, which doesn't include our lunch on a stone bench about half way up). Park highlights: Wizard Island, snow on Mount Scott, Pumice Castle, Phantom Ship, and Pinnacles. We also walked Castle Crest Wildflower Trail (where we saw three young deer) and Godfrey Glen (old growth forest). Only at 5:30 did we actually see across the lake, without its famous blue.","August 28, 2017","Unbelievable, though smoky during our visit",110,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5

Such an amazing work of nature to create such a magnificent spot.Be patient with the roads during peak season and be aware of cyclists in the middle of the road. Apparently cyclists have the same rights as a motor vehicle -- they just have no power to get out of the way.Take your time and stop to enjoy the scenery.

Crater Lake National Park,"A magnificent display of nature. Crater Lake National Park is without question a must-see location in this part of the US. There are a few tips to an enjoyable visit.Park entrance is $15 per vehicle and there are two entrance points; to the north-west and south-west. These become like bottle necks at busy times so arrive early to beat the crowds. You receive a lovely and informative map with your fee which outlines the major sites, routes and trails. Plan to spend at least 6 hours here (and anticipate traffic delays also). Bring your own food and ample fluids. Be aware that toilets are limited (and basic).Remember that your view (and your photographs) will be better if you have the sun behind you. So follow the sun east to west around the rim.Start in the south-east with a detour to the Pinnacles, then re-join rim drive in an anti-clockwise direction stopping at the prominent sites (clearly marked on the map). Be aware that the signs in some locations are poor or missing (such as for the parking area for Cleetwood Cove Trail). Keep in mind that the Watchman Overlook is extremely popular, especially later in the day.I would strongly recommend taking the hike down to the water at Cleetwood Cove Trail. There are portable toilets at the car park, where there are limited spaces for cars. There are also (rather disgusting) toilets at the end of the trail. Swimming in the lake is permitted at this location, which also serves as the boat tour dock (book early to avoid disappointment). The trail is long and steep, so bear that in mind.At the time of writing (August 2017) there are several wildfires in the vicinity which hamper visibility, may affect respiratory conditions, and affect trail closures. There are several bicycle events planned with road closures. There is also road works in progress on west rim drive. Check the NPS website before your visit.","August 24, 2017",A truly awe-inspiring natural wonder,101,,5

Nearby forest fires have generated a lot of smoke, and it was basically obscuring the view of the lake to almost nothing but murky grey white-out. I could hardly see the lake at all from the rim drive.I will have to go back some day in the future to actually experience Crater Lake when its possible to see it. I'm still giving this review 5 stars because I know that Crater Lake is amazing...when its visible.","August 23, 2017",Low visibility alert,25,"San Carlos, California",5

Crater Lake National Park,"Traveled to Crater Lake in early August with a group of friends. It was a truly beautiful sight. We walked down a trail to reach the lake and showed up early, before 8am. We were aware of wild fires in the area, but weren't too impacted in the early morning. It was hazy, but still had very nice views. We ventured off to an area to do some cliff jumping and enjoy the water. Would definitely recommend if you want a more thrilling adventure on the lake. The smoke progressively became worse as time passed. By noontime it was difficult to see anything. At the time we visited, the fire was only 7% contained.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater lake is amazing, I was visiting over the 4th of july long weekend and July seems like a perfect time to visit. With the long weekend, it's going to be very busy, so be prepared. There was lot of pollen in the lake, I was surprised with all the yellow floating on the lake and thought the lake was being polluted, only when I went up close realised it was pollen from all the trees around. Water is really cold.None the less crater lake is absolutely beautiful and breathtaking. Suggestions: If you are taking the trail to the lake, dont forget to take water, though it's a short hike it's a challenging one.For visiting parents from India, please consider their fitness level and age before heading down the trial to the lake, it is a challenging hike, I didn't take my parents down to the lake,they couldn't have handled the hike. I felt really sad to see some parents going down the trial and were finding it difficult, if going down seems difficult, coming back up is very challenging, please be mindful.","August 22, 2017",Gorgeous as always,2,"Portland, Oregon",5

We made the trip to see the lake and climb to Garfield Peak. We loved the adventure. The lake is stunning and the hike gave us the chance to stretch out the car legs.

Crater Lake National Park,"The beauty of Crater Lake has to be seen in person to be truly appreciated. While the pictures are fantastic, standing on the rim and gazing down on the bluest water you've ever seen is breathtaking. There are so many amazing facts regarding Crater Lake, water so clean and pure that it's used as a standard for comparison against water from all over the world, water so clear that it sets records for the depth that light can penetrate, and of course, the incredible way the volcano collapsed and formed the lake in the first place.You can approach Crater Lake from the north or the south, but I recommend taking the south entrance and visiting the Steel Visitor Center before going to see the lake. In addition to a nice gift shop, they have a 22 minute video that plays every 30 minutes that describes how the lake formed and some of the history of the park. It's well worth the time.I also suggest keeping an eye on the weather report so that you can dress appropriately. Our visit was in late July and the weather was warm, but I understand it can be quite cool at almost any time of year.Sinnott Overlook has still more information about the lake and the park and provides a terrific scenic overlook of the lake. The park system has done a great job of creating areas to get great views. Discovery Point Trail is a 1 mile (2 miles round-trip) walking trail that provides still more great views and picture-taking opportunities.We had lunch at the Crater Lake Lodge. Food choices are pretty limited, but we weren't there for fine dining. A spinach salad and turkey sandwich kept us going.It was very crowded the day we were there, but we only really noticed it when trying to park and at lunch.

Check the weather before you go as, where we were staying, it was in the 80s but the Lake area was in the 50s and you could see some patches of snow. Plenty of places to pull over and take photos. Due to smoke conditions, it was overcast so we didn't get to see the full ""blueness"" of the Lake. Also, make sure you have dealt with any food, bathroom, or gasoline issues when you are about 40 miles away (from the South anyway) as options get very limited on the drive.","August 20, 2017",Must See,13,"Cliffside Park, New Jersey",5

You can swim on the lake, but it's very cold!!!!By the time we had made it round to Watchmans Lookout, the afternoon light was poor, and the skies hazy. The surrounding wildfires made to air very smoky and the views not as good as earlier in the day. We left the park by the southern entrance around 3pm.... it was absolutely jammed with vehicles tailing back to the main road!

Crater Lake National Park,"There is so much to see in Oregon, it's had hard to decide what to do. This is our fourth trip and we finally made it to Crater Lake, and we're very glad we did. The beauty and grandeur of Crater Lake is hard for me to describe, and so I'll defer to other reviewers that are better at that sort of thing. I strongly recommend that you take the trolley tour around the lake. You can drive yourself, but you won't have the benefit of a park ranger explaining the wonders of Crater Lake. Also, the ranger knows where to stop for the best views. After the tour, we traveled around most of the lake on in our car, and I thought the views from the trolley were better--maybe because of the height. Plus, if you are the driver, you will miss a lot. The trolley is a little cramped, but for two hours, it wasn't bad. They do provide cushions for the hard seats. One last thing: try to visit Crater Lake on a sunny day to fully appreciate it's beauty.","August 19, 2017",Take the Trolley Tour,8,"Townsend, Massachusetts",5

A couple of hints--go early in the AM especially in July and August because smoke can obscure the view later in the day. Either REAL early to see the sunrise or midAM so the sun makes the lake a brilliant blue. Try to do the rim road if you can. Lots of overlooks to get different views. Watch for the ""old man of the lake""--a hemlock log floating vertically that moves around the lake. If you can, try the boat ride if you have time. We didn't but wish we did.

Crater Lake National Park,"We loved Crater Lake. No wonder this was a spiritual center for Native Americans in this area. Early Americans didn’t give the Indians any piece of it in treaties, but that is a different negative part of our history. Don’t miss the chance to hike down to the water at Cleetwood Cove. Although when we were there, they were doing construction on the road in this area, you could still park along the road and do the hike. It took us about 20 minutes down and 40 to come back up. Wear good shoes and expect to work hard on the hike back up. Do bring water and take the hike seriously. It is very steep. At the bottom, starting at different times each summer depending on the snow melt, there are boat tours of the lake in the summer depending on the snow melt. We loved driving all around the park road at the top of the ""crater"" to see the lake from all angles. The Lodge at one end is historic and beautiful. One drawback of the park is that there is very little lodging right at the park. The lodge books up very early in the year.

Crater Lake National Park,"We've seen lots of friends visit this park through social media through the years. To me, this place just ended up being a bucket list item to check off to say I've been there.The lake is the deepest in the US and 7th in the world. Water is among the cleanest and it's a very nice blue. Bluer than Lake Tahoe. The visitor center was educational it showing how it was formed.So why only 3 stars? Along the rim, the lake is so wide and you're pretty high up where it's hard to take a good picture. Unless you pay for the boat ride to Wizard Island or take a hike down, 95%+ of people just stay at the Rim level and it feels like most of the viewpoints are the same. Why drive all the way around for the viewpoints when they look so similar. You can't do any recreational activities in this park and there's not many places to hike. I love our National Parks System and have been to 16+. This was probably pretty far down the list. It's a drive to get here with not much else around the area.

The smoke was sop thick, you could barely see the water and could not see all the way across! Wait-so this is a 5 star review? We worked our way around the lake pulling off at every viewpoint and there are a lot. Views of Mt Scott, the phantom ship(island shaped like a ship), the Castle (a rock formation that looks more like the Southwest dessert), waterfalls, and finally the lodge. The wind gradually blew much of the smoke away revealing the lake and it's almost vertical sides.

Crater Lake National Park,This place is absolutely stunning - we visited in Aug me there were still patches of snow on the mountains which made for some great pictures in the 90 degree heat! The views of the lake are spectacular. The only downside for us was that we visited during the 3-4 day butterfly migration window and they were absolutely everywhere. We only stayed about an hour or so to take in the scenery but if you like hiking you could spend a significant amount of time here. ,"August 12, 2017",Stunning,75,"Sittingbourne, United Kingdom",5

When the wind shifts you can really smell the smoke. We only stayed 1 night at the lodge. We hiked down to the lake which I'm glad that we did because at the time the air was cloudy.

Crater Lake National Park,We went to Crater Lake and found that about 1/4 of the rim drive was closed off for fire fighting and due to heavy smoke. The remainder of the drive was simply spectacular and we enjoyed our time in the park. The smoke was very heavy at Rim Village so we did not linger there. Still lots of snow in places by the highway even in August - remarkable !We will certainly come back here (and hope there are no fires next time),"August 10, 2017",Check with the park for closure in the fire season !

Crater Lake National Park,My wife has wanted to visit this National Park since she was 8. She finally made it. The park is spectacular with the blue water magical even though we could not see all the way across the lake because of wildfires on the west side of the park. We arrived on Thursday August 3 and drove in the north entrance and along the west rim road. By Friday morning the west rim road was closed. By Saturday morning you could not see the water from the rim.We still ad a wonderful time hiking some of the easy trails and taking the trolley tour along the east rim. The park gets lots of snow averaging 44 feet a year so perhaps the best time to go is on the early fall before snowfall but after the wildfire season. The pictures below you can see the haze from the wildfires.,"August 9, 2017",Crater Lake during wildfire season,27,"Mount Laurel, NJ",5
Crater Lake National Park,"This park was the one destination I and my wife targeted as we drove from Lake Tahoe to Portland - and it was worth the drive even though we were robbed of seeing the blue of the lake due to the haze created by two fires outside the park. The visitor’s center has an excellent twenty-minute film describing the formation of the lake and the purity of the water - the purest, literally, on earth, it is 100% derived form melted snow, no creeks or streams run in ort out of the lake. From that point there are various routes to different areas of the park or you can take a Trolley Tour - we did - which was very informative not just about the Lake but the surrounding ecosystem. The first week of August found people still able to play in the snow in some parts of the park and found some trails closed due to the aforementioned fires. We spent half a day in the park, could easily spend an entire day without doing a major hike. One warning - if you plan to take the boat ride, or swim or fish, there is only one access point to the lake and rangers describe it best as “seven hundred feet down, seven thousand feet up” - the climb down - and up - is the equivalent of seventy flights of stairs.","August 9, 2017",Seeing is Believing - Even When You Cannot See,216,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",5

Crater Lake National Park,"My most recent visit was a quick trip through the park. It was also hampered by smoke from recent forest fires. Therefore my review is based more on my first visit in the fall of 2011.Formed from the geologically recent explosion of an active volcano. The resulting caldera has filled with water forming the lake. Take a drive around the crater and view Wizard Island, a new volcanic cone growing out of the lake.","August 9, 2017",Second Visit,46,"Omaha, Nebraska",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is BEAUTIFUL! We thoroughly enjoyed our visit, but if you are planning to go, look into the details before you do. Because of the heavy snow last winter, half of the rim road was still closed and the other half was under construction. This led to 10-20 minute delays anytime you wanted to go somewhere. We experienced the same issue at Glacier NP a few years ago; when the only construction can happen in the summer, things get bogged down. Be prepared for this if you are traveling with small children. Also, most of the hikes were still closed while we were there. We booked the boat tour with stop at Wizard Island in advance but one of the boats broke down and we were automatically rebooked on a tour-only. I understand this. I called and tried to change the time of the rebooked tour and my call was not returned. Then, when I got to the lodge to change the time, there was no way to do that except to book a new tour and then get refunded from the company. I understand that things change, but the reservation system is odd. You can only book 24 hours before the tour, if you haven't booked online in advance, and so we had to just hang around the lodge to be in line at the right time. Also, after hiking the 1.1 miles down to the boat dock, our tour was cancelled AGAIN because the other boat broke down. I understand all of this, but didn't really know before I booked that this was a common occurence. I spoke with a woman who said 3 out 5 years her boat tour had been cancelled. Due to the cancelled tour, we jumped off the rock into the lake (Highly Recommended!) and then left a day earlier than planned because we had run out of things to do.","August 9, 2017",Amazing park - when everything is open and working.,7,"Littleton, Colorado",4

Crater Lake National Park,"I spent the better part of a day here with my wife and young kids recently. The air was hazy with the smoke from the nearby wild fire, but we still got to experience the lake and most of it's views with no problems.Crater Lake National Park is not easy to get to, even if you're in Oregon. We drove from Seaside, it took us about 6 hours (with some stops). There really isn't much to stop for along the way, we drove through several national forests and lake zones which were scenic. Driving back to Portland from Crater Lake, we took the route through Bend, the butte views were impressive as were the views of Mt Hood as we got closer to Portland. Would recommend driving both routes if you get the chance.We couldn't get lodging in the park, so we ended up staying in Chemult. Not much there there, and it was still about a 30-40 drive to get to the park. We couldn't see too much driving in due to the tall trees on the road and the wild fire smoke, but once we got up on the crater rim we had some incredible views. We were thinking about doing the hike down to the lake shore, but a ranger talked us out of it due to our young kids. We did a hike along Watchman Peak, it was a bit strenuous but the views were rewarding.The view with Wizard Island reminded me a lot of the Lake Tahoe view with Fannette Island.All in all, it's not necessarily easy to get to Crater Lake, but we were very glad we made the trip.","August 7, 2017",Beautiful Sights and Hikes,551,"Austin, Texas",4

Crater Lake National Park,"When we first pulled up to the first lookout point, I had to remind myself to breathe - it was stunning. The blue you see on a clear, sunny day cannot be replicated or truly captured in any photo. That being said, if you want to make sure you have this awe-inspiring moment, do your research before you go. Some tips:-Don't go any sooner than late July: My friends and I got into the park on July 22 and they had JUST opened the rest of the main road. The park got 54 ft. of snow this past year, so they JUST cleared the rest of the roads to open them up for visitors. Several hiking trails were still closed due to snow.-Forest fires: My friends went early August and forest fires were so bad, the smoke made visibility of the lake almost 0%. You can't avoid natural disasters, but something to be aware of.-Wear layers: temps varied between 65˚F and 85˚F depending where in the park you were, so layer up-Get the lay of the land: I recommend first driving the entire Rim Drive to get a sense of the park. We did this on day 1, where we then pulled off at multiple scenic viewpoints. Then, day 2 was reserved for hiking.-Hiking: we did easy/moderate hikes, the ones worth checking out are Sun Notch, Plaikni Falls, and Discovery Point","August 7, 2017",Stunning Views - But Do Your Research!,17,"Columbus, Ohio",5

The blue color of the lake was breathtaking. In addition to enjoying the beautiful vistas there are several trails available to hike.We took the Cleetwood Cove Trail. I would definitely call this moderately strenuous. Don't attempt if you are not in good shape.The only downside was the traffic and crowds. Finding parking at the lodge is a challenge. This is the only place to get food so good luck.As awe inspiring as Crater Lake is, I can not imagine staying there for more than a half day.

Crater Lake National Park,"Was so excited to see Crater Lake NP. Drove 5 hours out of our way to get here. Forest Fires on the West Rim made visibility close to zero. As another reviewer said, it would have been nice if the Ranger at the entrance told us we would not be able to see a thing. Might have turned around and headed to Bend. Spent 5 hours in the park. Came out smelling like smoke, eyes stinging and breathless. Soot covered our car, our clothing and our hair. Such a disappointment. I guess I'll have to come back in July. The one thing the ranger did tell me was that forest fires are par usual in August. Keep that in mind when planning your trip. We did hike to the bottom and the kids jumped from the cliff to swim. That was the highlight of the day. It took us 20 minutes to hike in, about 35 to hike out. It is steep. I imagine it is breathtaking when you can see.

Crater Lake National Park,"We visited Crater Lake enroute from Medford to Portland. We arrived very early in the morning (around 8 AM), which turned out to be a good move as the lake was calm like glass and we essentially had the park to ourselves, apart from the guests that were staying at the lodge. We spoke to a ranger and asked for a recommendation on a hike to do with our three young but keen boys (ages 11, 9 and 4). She suggested the best views were on the Garfield trail (my instinct was to do the rim trail, so this was welcome advice). The Garfield trail hike starts behind the lodge and although at the trailhead the hike is classified as strenuous, it was not difficult at all – definitely lots of uphill but easy climbing, with absolutely stunning views of Crater Lake, which far exceeded the views from the rim near the lodge and parking areas. You could also see old lava flows that had eroded along the path, tons of butterflies, beautiful pines and views of other mountains and volcanoes in the distance.We ended up taking the trail all the way up to a big snowy area near the top, where the kids did some bum tobogganing in their shorts and had an awesome snowball fight before we headed back down. A beautiful hike that was good exercise for the whole family and took less than 2 hours.The facilities at Crater Lake exceeded my expectations – lots of clean restrooms, a really nice gift shop with a cafeteria (and decent coffee), ample parking, a trolley service (you need to buy a ticket) to visit various viewpoints, etc. I didn’t see a water bottle refill station (which is common in US National Parks) but I seem to recall water fountains and other opportunities to refill bottles.","August 4, 2017",Fantastic national park with awesome views and hikes,248,"Toronto, Canada",5

We weren't able to take the boat tour since it was sold out but did enjoy driving on mainly the east rim since a portion of the west rim was under road construction. I highly recommend that you read the newsletter before you go to gather information on what you want to see based on the time that you are there. It's available online.

Crater Lake National Park,"This visit was part of a extended tour throughout the west of the USA and Canada, visiting many National Parks. We visited Crater Lake National Park, the weekend before the 4th July! I had expected it to be busy, but.... We queued (sat in line) for over an hour, this was caused by the volume of traffic, but also by poor organisation, there is a road junction on the way to the southern entrance, and there was no one there to direct the traffic, having a ranger there to let say 50 cars through from each directions would have smoothed and speeded up the traffic flow, instead of the free for all that ensued. I did mention this to a ranger, but I think that it either went over the top of his head, or like many of the staff he was just dis-interested. At the entrance no mention was made of the fact that not all of the rim drive was open due to snow blocking the road. There were lots of roadworks which again caused chaos. It seems incredible to me that the National Park Service (NPS) would schedule road works for what is probably the busiest time of the year in the USA, Independence Day weekend. Ranger were virtually non existent, parking was next to impossible, This is did detract hugely from the visit to what is a beautiful location. I would suggest that a complete change of staff is required from the top down, although I guess that perhaps the NPS probably do not care, because the reality is that if you want to see Crater Lake you have to come here, they have a Monopoly!","July 30, 2017",Fantastic Scenery - Very poor Organisation and Traffic Management,13,"London, United Kingdom",2

Unlike Tahoe, the development is little, and the lake is mostly unaccessible except to view from above. But like the Grand Canyon, this is worth the view. There are vista points around the lake, and the foolhardy do cross out of them and near the rim. I don't advise this unless you want to be featured on a YouTube fail.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake was very beautiful! I traveled with a group of 12 ranging in age from 5 to 52, and all enjoyed the picturesque views. If you're traveling with young children I highly recommend stopping by the ranger station to pick up a free jr. ranger activity book. Upon completion, they can turn it in for a jr ranger badge. They also had a schedule of free jr ranger activities, which earned the kids a jr. Ranger patch. While the weather was warm enough to wear a tank top and shorts, there was still lots of snow on the ground, and my kids had fun with a snowball fight. A couple of tips:-Be sure to download offline maps before you reach the crater lake vicinity. We lost cellphone reception over an hour before we reached the park. Some in our group regained reception at rim village, but I did not (with AT&T).-Bring refillable water bottles and fill them up at the Rim Village Cafe. -Be sure to bring mosquito repellent!-There are no large grocery stores in the area. If you plan on camping and cooking your own meals, be sure to stock up on all your essentials before you arrive. (There are ""camp"" stores in the area, with very limited selections). -There were very long bathroom lines in rim village. Instead, the lodge is about a 15 min walk away, and had no lines. -If you have the time, I highly recommend staying till nightfall. The sunsets are beautiful, and stars are amazing. Just be sure to dress appropriately, as the temperatures dip significantly once the sun goes down. The lodge also served excellent hot cocoa, which was a real treat!","July 23, 2017",Snow in July!,2,"Mililani, Hawaii",4

Worth seeing as you learn a lot about the Lake's history. Rim Village is worth seeing, especially the area's lookouts. The hotel there has a reasonable dining room and lunch was good. Being the summer, everywhere was crowded but acceptable. We drove around the Lake as far as we could and we recommend you take the time to do this. Once you get away from Rim Village, the pull-outs are less crowded and you get many great views of the lake.

The East rim route was closed for the most part so we didn't get to see the Pinnacles Overlook but it was worthwhile to drive to the closure point so we could take the short hike to see the ""ship"" and the visitor center was also open at the lodge...well worth the time as park rangers give presentations on the history of Crater Lake and all of the plant and animal life there.","July 19, 2017",Spectacular!!,0,,5

Crater Lake National Park,"Having just returned from a road trip of Oregon in which Crater Lake was one of our ""must see"" stops I have to say it is certainly worth a visit for anybody who appreciates natures beauty. The lake is stunning from every single angle, and there are plenty of angles of which to take a photo from. That being said, the lake is obviously very popular and the traffic in and out of the park is pretty bad and the parking, especially at Rim Village, is even worse. We entered from the North Entrance and had to go west to reach the Rim Village, which meant passing through a 30 minute delay for roadworks. Since all cars heading to Rim Village are stuck in this traffic, once they're allowed to continue they ALL head to the village, so hundreds of cars pour into the village at once, all looking for parking. It took us around 20 minutes to get a spot, and we were very lucky to do so. The village was total mayhem for cars. Unfortunately though, I'd have to say the best photos of the lake are from the village as Wizard Island is nearby which makes your photos better, so you should definitely make the effort to get into Rim Village. After leaving the village we had to go back through the roadworks (another 30 minutes) before driving the East Rim drive as far as we could before it was closed for snow. There was a lot of nice views here and it was MUCH less busy, however, the photos weren't quite as nice as Wizard Island was too far away to see. Overall we probably spent 3 hours in Crater Lake National Park and I'd say that was PLENTY of time. I don't get why people dedicate days to see a lake. Once you've seen it from a few angles, taken a few photos and perhaps walked a trail, there really isn't that much else to see there. There is very little in the way of amenities either. I have to say though, Crater Lake is not the prettiest lake I have ever seen. That award has to go to Moraine Lake in the Canadian Rockies. Now THAT is a road trip everybody should do once in their life.","July 17, 2017",Beautiful but too crowded. Don't dedicate too much time here!,231,"Vancouver, Canada",4

Crater Lake National Park,"Spent a total of three days here. The rim drive is beautiful (at least the parts we were allowed to see). Seeing snow fields in July is a treat for Floridians. We stopped and built snowmen and threw snowballs a few times.Unfortunately there wasn't much else to the park. There was only 1 hiking trail open completely and we did that. A 2.2 mile (round trip) to the lake shore where we watched people jump in the freezing cold lake. The ""rim trail"" was only partially open and we watched as hikers wre redirected along the road for large sections.The East rim drive was closed due to snow for a good portion, as was the Pinnacles road. The ""Watchman trail"" was also closed. The parking ovrlook for Watchman was under construction and closed as well. Fortunately we were able to access the nearby road for parking because construction vehicles weren't there on Sunday.The boat tour was also closed.The NPS also needs to work on their interpretive displays in the park. Since there is really only one main feature to the park, there is a lot of redundancy in their signs. That's to be expected. However we found that signs in different places often offered conflicting information to other signs. Nothing too dramatic, but we noticed it on multiple occasions, so somebody needs to review that material.Crater Lake is a beautiful scene, no doubt, but I felt that three days was way more time than I wanted to spend there and usually have to be dragged out of parks.","July 16, 2017","Amazing Views, beautiful drive - not much else.",64,South Florida,3

You'll have some detours or delays as roads become ONE WAY. A lead vehicle will guide you through the construction. At Crater Lake there is little to nothing to eat outside of breakfast, lunch or dinner hours at the Lodge + very costly. There is a snack ""place"" but the food is pre-made and packaged + costly for what you get. So it's might best best to pack or purchase a good lunch before visiting.There are a few handicapped parking spaces but not many.

We only ended up staying 2 of 3 nights before moving to our next destination.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is certainly one of the most beautiful places I have been. Very busy, as we went over the Fourth of July weekend, but if you get there early in the day traffic isn't so bad. West Rim drive has some truly gorgeous views, particularly early in the morning (around 8 or 9am) when the reflections on the water make for a truly spectacular sight. East Rim road was still partially closed due to snow, but it was a wonderful trip nonetheless. There is a lot of construction going on right now (July 2017), so be prepared for some traffic and try to go early in the day if possible. The Union Creek area also has lots of camp site options if you find that camp sites in the park are full.","July 3, 2017",Truly beautiful place,5,"Seattle, Washington",5

Crater Lake National Park,Our family took a side trip to drive past Crater Lake on our way to Idaho. It cost $15 to enter the park and there was a cute gift shop with great finds at the south entrance. We parked at the first parking lot to the left of the road and walk a very short distance to a large viewing area for pedestrians (no risk of being hit by cars or falling over a cliff- there's a rock wall). The view took our breath away!! The water was like a mirror of a variety of blues from the sky and images of the surrounding snow-capped peaks. DEFINITELY worth it! We enjoyed the view from a few different stops along the drive.,"July 3, 2017",Breathtaking views!,10,"Claremont, California",5

Definitely worth the 90 minute drive out from the Medford/Grant's Pass area even though many hikes were still closed due to a huge snow fall the previous winter.

Although we were unable to hike the wildflower trails, we were thrilled to behold such beauty.

It is a 700 foot down to the water, but as my friend said is well worth the hike. The lodge is beautiful, lots of History. It is immaculately maintained.

Crater Lake National Park,"Gave this a one star for a very good reason, we could NOT see the lake.Yep, our June 2017 vacation that I waited for over the last 40-years was in the middle of a snow storm blizzard and the snow was from 6 to 16 feet deep around the lake and the visitor's center. Visibility was about 500 feet and although many with children loved the snow, it totally blocked the view of the lake. Did make it up to the top parking lot and building and did walk through the storm only to find a gift shop with very little food and services. Totally glad we had our NPS Senior's card as if we had paid for this 'experience' it would have been horrible. In clear warm weather plan on two to four hours at the site as you should be able to circle the lake {We could not due to the snow closing the north entry and the circle drive}.Directions from I-5 are somewhat vague and we got lost where OR-234 meets OR-62. You need to turn LEFT at the intersection that feels like you should be turning right. GPS and phone service is intermittent in the area. You can do the trip from Crescent City to Crater Lake and then to Klamath falls in one day. Be prepared for possible detours and winding hilly roads.","June 21, 2017",June turned out to NOT be the time to visit..,59,Arizona,1

Crater Lake National Park,"We just left Crater Lake and was amazed. I always had a visual picture in my mind of how majestic I thought it was but in real life it is amongst the most amazing sights that I have ever seen. We actually stayed in Medford and drove to the park. It was about 2 1/2 hours back and forth. From the number of people there, I assume this is not the busy time of the year. It was $15 for the carload of us. Parking took about 1 minute to find and was abundant. There was so much snow on the ground that the road around Crater Lake was closed. If you have interest in riding the boat on the lake, check with the park first. The ranger thought it would be multiple weeks before the road would be cleared to get to the trail. Just a FYI that this is over 7000 feet up so those with pulmonary issues just need to be a bit careful since the oxygen content is around 70% of that at sea level. There are a ton of view points and the pictures you take if it is a clear day will last a lifetime. You really just have to be careful. There were a ton of people climbing over walls and going past signs that said danger. Since you are 700+ feet above the lake, there is no coming back.Like most parks there is a lodge, small cafeteria and a gift shop. Definitely worth a look. I can't wait to go back when the snow melts and the road is completely opened though the downside will be the massive crowds. I can now understand why.

Crater Lake National Park,"You can't look at this and not be in awe of nature. Amazing, the volcano collapsed on itself 7700 years ago. Lava from the base escaped around the cone of the mountain and as a result the base could no longer hold the top cone of the mountain, and it collapsed on it self, creating a perfect cauldron. Over the years, going through lots of winters, the snow melted into the creator and created the beautiful blue water. There are no rivers or streams that come or go from the lake, so the water in there is extremely pure.

They said that most of the crater rim isn't accessible until at least mid-June. Check ahead on line. One part of the rim isn't open until mid-July. Even though we were restricted to seeing the Visitors Center, The Crater Lake Lodge area, including the Sinnott Memorial Overlook, the Rim Cafe & Gift Shop and the Discovery Point, you get wonderful views of the lake and Wizard Island.

Crater Lake National Park,"In a quest to visit all the national parks, we visited Crater Lake in May one year, only to find that there was snow and fog, and there was zero view of the lake. We went up to the top and toured the visitor's center, but since we came to see the lake, we felt we couldn't cross it off our list.This time we visited in July, and - would you believe it? - there was still some snow to be found! We threw snowballs while comfortable wearing shorts and short sleeves. Definitely worth a repeat visit in order to see the deep, vibrant blue of the lake. We didn't go down to the water, but while taking photos down into it, you realize how big that lake must be, in order for the boats you're seeing to appear so small.Allow plenty of time for driving into the park, up the mountainous roads, and back down. When we were there, there was a long wait to get into the park (you pay your admission or show your annual pass at a guard shack). You couldn't see it until you were up close, but the line split off for those who either had cash or the annual pass, and that line moved much more quickly. Also, because the snow lasts so long, the time period they have for working on the roads is very short - and it coincides with the best time to visit for the same reason. So there was construction going on that reduced the already narrow two lane road through the park down to one lane. Those with a fear of heights will want to have somewhere else to look during certain parts of the drive...This park is sort of isolated, as it's not too near an airport (or really any civilization) so the logistics of getting there make it a pretty full day. We wished we'd built in 2 days on our original visit, so that if perhaps the weather broke on the 2nd day we'd have had a shot at seeing the lake, rather than having to come out west (with the flights involved, etc.) on a completely new trip.But we don't regret the cost and effort of the 2nd trip - it was worth it to see the beauty of the lake!","June 1, 2017",Took us 2 trips years apart to get to see it on a clear day - but it was worth it!,450,"Winter Garden, Florida",5

Crater Lake National Park,"Driving out here can take a while depending on which routes are closed due to snow, but once you are here you will form some life-long memories. The lake is enormous, a clear deep blue, with a dead silent tranquility to it. On an especially clear day, the rim of the caldera reflects perfectly in the water so it can become hard to tell where the rocks end and the water begins.If you stay the night and it's a clear sky (most are), make your way to the rim of the caldera and you can see more stars than most people will ever see in their lifetimes - you can even see the Milky Way itself. This might be worth the trip on its own, honestly. You'll really get a Pale Blue Dot moment out of it.The visitor center is very helpful with destination tips, a free water bottle refilling station, neat merchandise, and a fun short film you can watch. It's also open year round, so even if the lodge and camp grounds farther up the road are closed for the season, you can at least stop at the visitor center.Lots to do here if you're into bird watching - look for unusual Corvids like the Clark's Nutcracker or a Gray Jay.You might also see Bald Eagles soaring across the lake at times.","May 24, 2017",You won't believe these views are real,8,,5

When we got to the lake, the gift shop building was so snow covered still that there was a separate entrance so that you could get in. It was 90 degrees down low the day we were there and 53 at the lake. I was walking through snow in sandals to see the lake!!. Had lunch in the gift shop because we were very hungry. My husband had chili and said it was delicious. I had chicken with wild rice soup and it was delicious as well. We then share a hot dog which was a large hot dog and plenty for us both.

The loop which circles the park was closed for one direction of traffic at a time as September is the time of year they do their road maintenance. The wait time for traffic in one direction was about a half hour severely cutting into our time to visit the park. When we finally arrived at the park visitor center we were told that we couldn't get to the trail to go down into the crater except by bus and the bus was leaving within minutes. The bus fee was exorbitant, but we decided to take it so we could make it to the trail. As it turns out, you can actually make it to the trail via a relatively short hike along the road from a parking place up the road from the trail. The parking for the trail we wanted to take was closed due to the fact that it was being used for construction vehicles - poor planning on the park's part to close a parking area for a popular hiking spot. If we had known we could have hiked the short distance from the next parking area over and saved ourselves a couple hundred dollars. Also, because we had to take the bus, we were stopped by the same construction that had stopped us on the way into the park - another half hour delay. Most of the day at Crater Lake was spent just stopping in traffic. This was my worst experience of poor management at a national park.","May 19, 2017",Incredible natural beauty; poorly managed and difficult to get to sites,21,"Rexford, New York",2

The day before we arrived at Crater Lake we parked the car to take pictures of us out in ankle deep snow and had fun playing in the snow before driving on. Next day we drove up to Crater Lake in a scenery where the road had snow wall of 12ft!!What can I say Crater Lake was all quiet and looked semi-frozen! We headed to the visitors center and saw the video regarding the origin of Crater Lake, this 20 minutes during movie which our 15-year-old did not want to see but ended up telling us that it was actually ""doable"". We bought some postcards and headed out to Crater Lake itself. It was gorgeous! To be honest knowing how this all happened and what you are looking at definitely changes the way you look at things and I was in love at once. The serene lake, the walls of white snow it all looks so gorgeous. As we now know how Crater Lake looks in snow we have decided that we should come back in summer or at the end of the summer to see the blue lake we saw on the video.","May 2, 2017",O.M.G it was so cold who knew!!,44,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida",4

We stopped at the Visitor Center which had a 15 foot snow bank in the middle of the parking lot. We drove up to the rim - it was about 3 miles further up and it snowed even harder.

Despite being the height of summer, it was not overrun by visitors, probably due to the fact that it is off the beaten track. Oregon is big. Snow can fall fairly late, even in summer. We were told it was still snowing up top in July last year. On a beautiful summer's day, the famous blue lake will take your breath away. After completing the drive around the rim and wearing down your camera's battery, you can stop off at the lodge for a relaxing drink while you enjoy the view. If you are into cycling, you can also make the climb from the park entrance to the summit (over 1800 metres) and tick it off your bucket list.

Crater Lake National Park,This is the deepest lake in the entire United States. This lake was originally part of the western volcanic mountain range. Set between Mr Hood in Oregon and Mt. Shasta in northern California this lake was created when the volcano collapsed inside itself. This lake features the clearest water in any lake in the United States. There are no streams or rivers feeding water into so the only water in the lake comes from snow which has melted from the interior of the walls of the collapsed volcano. The park is not always open in the winter because of the large amounts of snowfall in the area. There are multiple access points onto the rim road which circles the entire lake. There is an old hotel which is great for those who want to find a relaxing place to visit for a day or two. There is some hiking available in the surrounding area if that is your desire. For those who want to add to their adventure you can hike from the rim down to the lake and get on a boat that will take you on a tour to Wizard island in the lake and to a couple other viewing areas at lake level. Food at the hotel is very good and you can sit on the back patio and enjoy the scenery while you eat. The drive to the lake is on good roads and and you can reach it from several cities in south central Oregon. This is a very good location for people of all ages with ranger tours for kids.,"April 10, 2017",Unique Location in the USA,53,"Eagle Point, Oregon",4

However, you might want to call ahead if you're planning to visit in May or June to find out when they expect ""the mosquitoes."" We happened to arrive during mosquito breeding season.Crater Lake itself is stunning. The Lodge was beautiful and we were fortunate to arrive for a ranger-led program on the back porch. We also took a hike from The Lodge to the rim of the crater. It wasn't until we began our return descent that the mosquitoes began to come out. So, it's not like they're out all the time, but late afternoon/early evening you'll definitely want some bug spray or just hang out at The Lodge.We did not stay at The Lodge, but drove on north to Chemult. But, during the drive around the crater, there are several pull-outs to enjoy the scenery. Every one of them is worth a stop. However, because of the mosquitoes, we would allow other motorists to get out of their cars first to attract the mossies away from us so we could run up to the edge and take pics, then get back in the car to head to the next pull-out.

This is a must-not-miss for everyone who is a National Park junky and for those who just want to retreat into one of the best spots on earth to drive around and see one refreshing view after another, to hike and discover more than what you can see driving around, and to swim into the deepest, blues lake in the United States. For us, a family with small kids (4 and 6 yrs), we went down the Cleetwood Trail (1.1 mile) with no issues; conquered the generous pathway and got to the boat dock in a good amount of time to still be able to dip our feet into the water, relax, enjoy the view, before we took the 2 hour tour across and around the massive crater. After the very informative tour, we were still able to wet our feet again and may have had time to go for a swim if not for the anxiety that we may not make it back up the trail (with the kids not getting grumpy) in time for dinner. The walk back up was very long as we had to stop several times but getting back up to the road was a feat for us parents. After that, we completed the loop around the crater and went back to the lodge for dinner.

Crater Lake National Park,"I have lived within an hour drive of this beautiful lake for years and often take visiting family and friends to this amazing sight. Each time it ends up being the highlight of the visit. Crater Lake is truly awe inspiring. It is located about 1 1/2 hours from Medford OR , 2 hours from Roseburg and 2 from Bend. The National park has several entrances open in the summer and can be very crowded with limited parking when busy, especially for RV's. There are views from everywhere and many hikes, a beautiful lodge and some small cafes and country store for a quick bite and souvenirs. There is a camping ground with a store and cafe but it fills up fast in the summer and would recommend reservations way in advance. It is located a 15 minute drive from the rim so you are not camping with views of the lake itself. If you are going in the winter be advised the roads to the rim are often closed due to snow and weather conditions.If you want to enjoy a great place to stay that is close try Diamond Lake which is only about a 20 minute drive from Park. It has tons of camping, some private RV parks, a lodge, trail around the lake, a marina you can rent water craft, horse back riding and several small restaurants. Crater lake has historical tours and park rangers that are very knowledgeable. It is a great stop when driving between Bend, OR and Medford,Or to return to I-5. Just remember this is mountainous and small winding hwy so plan for it to take longer than expected. There are some beautiful stops along the drive so give yourself time to enjoy it all.

The roads were partially closed and so access was limited. But what we did see and hike - oh, what glory. The startling colors of lake, sky and shadows were magical. And two days later (and 20 degrees warmer), we went over to the lodge area. Again, there is a magic quality to the surroundings.

Crater Lake National Park,"I had seen a ton of photos of Crater Lake online and in magazines and I expected it to be beautiful, but when I drove up the road to the rim and I first laid eyes on the lake I was completely awestruck. The water was just as blue, if not more blue, as the photos I had seen. Being on the rim and looking down at the lake it feels like you are on top of the world. The drive was great, we were there in July and there was a lot of snow on the ground. The only thing we didn't love was the road construction, because it backed up traffic. But when there is that much snow, there really is no other time to be able to work on the roads. We mainly drove the Rim Drive and we were not disappointed. My favorite overlook was probably The Watchman Overlook because it has a good view of Wizard Island. Phantom Ship Overlook is great, too. We saw a porcupine on the south east part of the park, it was awesome!Mazama Village has a gas station and a store, which was good because the park is really remote.

Crater Lake National Park,"My husband and I met another couple the day before our trip in October that said they couldn't see it due to heavy snowfall. The next day we headed there with the sun shining. The drive up to the crater was gorgeous with crisp snowfall and blue skies. At the perimeter road, the direction that takes you to Watchman's Peak was closed, but we wanted to go clockwise so that we were on the lakeside driving the rim. First stop, gorgeous. Second stop, breathtaking. The lake color changed from a deep steel blue to a gorgeous bright blue as the day progressed. Snow on the trees and mountain peaks made it all the more special. Only drawback was we had to turn around due to road closure near the visitor center and watchman's peak, so it took a little longer than expected. But seeing the surrounding mountains and vistas was an added bonus. You can probably do the drive in a couple of hours with some stopping, but if you have the time, allow more time. Also, make sure your gas tank is full since it is in a remote area.","January 17, 2017",Prepare to be awestruck,9,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",5

We booked a boat trip which was an experience in itself; being sent from one place to another only to find a poor internet connection and then having to wait 4 hrs. We eventually secured tickets for the next day and failed to read on the receipt that the trip time was when the boat departed and we needed to be there earlier (2 hrs earlier).

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake National Park is one of those places that should be on everyone's must-see list. It is much smaller in scope than other landmarks like the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, or Yellowstone. But its uniqueness more than qualifies it for the A-list of National Park attractions.I would strongly suggest a viewing of the movie, which shows how Crater Lake formed, and which can be seen at the park Visitor's Center frequently throughout the day. The movie provides a clear explanation of how the lake formed, from a collapse of the peak of a massive volcano.Then, when you drive up to the rim, be prepared for the awesome sight of a large mountain lake with a seemingly very small area from which to get its water. But this is the case, as Crater Lake maintains its level through rain and from snow melt off the surrounding peaks. As the lake level does not vary much from year to year, this is a great example of a natural balance that's been maintained here for millennia. The rim road is a great way to see the lake from every direction, although you'd need to schedule your visit the park in the peak summer months, as the road is often closed in June, and may be closed again in September if the snow starts early.There is an imposing lodge at the south end of the lake, which would be a great place to stay during a visit to the park. There is further accommodation in cabins, close to the south entrance, plus a number of campgrounds as well to choose from.On this trip, we did not sample any of the hiking opportunities around the park. There don't appear to be many, but the hikes that I explored in the guide books sounded very tempting. We'll make sure to include these on our next visit.","December 31, 2016",A Must See in Oregon,101,"Cameron Park, California",5

We then spent some time hiking the area around hotel/restaurant/gift shop. We where grade that we took the tour because the guide was very informative and it is a hair raising drive. This way we learned and relaxed. There is also tour on the electric boat which you can arrange. The younger generations did that and enjoyed it. It is a hard hike up and down no assistance given. We then had a nice lunch at the hotel/restaurant. This is a federal facility so if you are a senior as I am and have $15.00 lifetime pass you get in for free.

One of the deepest lakes in b the US. I was especially Glad there was no development around the lake and only one tour boat allowed on the lake assuring us it will always be a prestine area. There were many great hiking paths throughout the park with some great vistas.,"November 28, 2016",Refreshing and beautiful ,3,"Athens, Ohio",5

Crater Lake National Park,"We had this on our bucket list and after we moved to WA we decided that it was time for a road trip to Crater lake.It took us 5 hours to get there and it was worth every second.Standing on the rim looking out at the deepest lake in North America was something we'll never forget. I over heard a little girl standing near me and she said ""It doesn't look real"" I thought the same thing.The color of the water was insanely beautiful the bluest blue we've ever seen.Wizard island and phantom ship are really cool.We could have our fur baby with us on the rim trail by the south rim visitor center so that was awesome.Crater lake is one of the most amazing parks in the U.S and it should go on everyone's bucket list.","November 27, 2016",The deepest lake in North America and the bluest.,417,"Camas, Washington",5

Crater Lake National Park,"I went to the park in November, so the North gate and Rim Roads are closed in the park. You can expect plenty of snow above 5000 feet, but the Park Village that sits on the crater rim is open - they have a small snack bar, a gift shop, and plenty of vantage points to see the lake. Take the Oregon scenic byway from Roseburg and you'll travel along the Umpqua river and have plenty of opportunities to stop and hike, fish, or picnic by a variety of waterfalls. Very few people visit this time of year so you can take your time and enjoy the scenery. Make sure you have plenty of gas, there are no stations open this time of year in the park. Take snacks along - the snack bar at the park has a limited (and over-priced) menu. Truly breathtaking views!

Crater Lake National Park,"We stopped here in late June during a road trip. The views were amazing - the sky was a bright blue to match the water. Even in late June, there was still snow (we couldn't drive around the crater) and we had a snowball fight at our first stop. We stayed at an inn about half an hour away from the park because we had a dog and none of the park lodging is pet-friendly.","November 14, 2016",Amazing Views,35,"Puyallup, Washington",5
Crater Lake National Park,"A friend and I were doing a West Coast Road trip which involved a lot of eating and drinking, I thought it would be nice to break this up a little with a visit to Crater Lake to do some hiking.If you google Crater Lake the pictures are amazing, however nothing can prepare you for the scenery that awaits.The blue of the water in the crater is so blue that it almost looks like it's been photoshopped, it's simply unreal.We did two hikes, the Mount Scott trail and the Garfield Peak trail, both are classified as ""strenuous"". I would say strenuous is fair but I would say even if you were in medium shape or fitness you could do one, but maybe not both.The views from the top of both peaks are amazing, Mount Scott is the highest but you are a little further away from the main crater, Garfield Peak is the next highest and is right next to the crater to offers some great photo opportunities.You have to drive between the various trails, well certainly between Mount Scott and Garfield Peak anyway.I'd have loved to spend a few more days in the park hiking but time was against us.If you're staying in the area then I can recommend the Prospect Historic Hotel (see my review on that), there is a hotel in the park but good luck trying to book that, its the only hotel in the park and gets booked up way in advance.In short, probably some of the most amazing scenery I have EVER seen, probably the highlight of my West Coast Road trip.","November 6, 2016",Amazing scenery,32,"London, United Kingdom",5
Crater Lake National Park,"The bluest lake I have ever seen in my entire life. I dont how to describe it, it so mesmerzing. The deep green cone surrounded by the deep blue lake and along the edges with snow.We visited around June or August. All I knew, the snow was still on the ground. Very cold and windy. Got to run every now and then into our vehicle for cover. From the howling wind. Make sure bring layers of jacket, otherwise you will be miserable. We stay for a few hours only. Tip for you folks. Turn off your GPS as it will lead you to ""the road less travel"", I mean literally. Hubby follow the s%&-d GPS ( or is it the driver) which lead us to the woods. We told the ranger at the park entrance and he got a good laugh of our misadventure. I guess he heard it so many times.

It is an amazing geological, natural and just overall beautiful spot to visit, do spend a few days hiking and enjoying all it has to offer. We also did the hike down to the boat tour of the lake, taking us over to Wizard Island and around the Phantom Ship. Well worth the opportunity to see it from water level as well as the rim. The movie on the history of the lake presented by the Information centre is great in helping to understand how this amazing spot came to be, though the information centre is way too tiny for all the interested visitors. Extra information is available above the main gift shop. I took way too many pictures but it is a highlight of our trip.

You get to see all the sights, learn extra facts and stories, and don't have to drive the rim yourself. Go back on your own to places you want to spend more time or hikes you want to take.

Other roads around the lake are closed for the season. There was a tour with snow shoes but most people did fine walking around in regular shoes. Food is available be there.

This lake has a heavenly color to its waters, which combined with clear skies, morning or afternoon, will saturate your senses with so many hues of blue, you'll have plenty to bring back home. Ther are some repairs on the roads in the west side of the park, still, the wait was not bad, and you have the option to take the east side road, which is not that crowded. Parking areas are clean and easy to access. The only setback was that the trail that takes you to the lake shore was under construction, so we couldn't hike down to the water, still the experience was unlike anything we have done before. We stayed late at night to see the night sky, and it is something to feast your eyes with. The Milky Way in all its glory in the middle of the sky. It was pitch dark, and still we felt pretty safe. This is a place I will definitely come back to spend more time, maybe during the winter, but I will wait until all the repairs are done.","October 23, 2016",Simply amazing,27,"San Diego, California",5

It was gorgeous in the snow. Lots of places to stop for pictures.This park has a lot of snow, so it's not unusual for the North entrance to close in early October. Don't let that deter you. The South entrance is open year round. In mid-October, the weather was 37 degrees with a howling wind and lots of snow. So, take plenty of outerwear to layer up while you explore.The parking lots at the top weren't plowed very well, so traffic was down to one lane around the loop. Just take your time to find a place to park. You can't go wrong no matter where you start.The larger store and cafe was closed when we were there. Rim Village Cafe and Gift Shop stay open all year. We didn't find much for children in here. If you go around lunch time, try Beckie's for lunch on Hwy 62 not too far away from the entrance.

Crater Lake National Park,This is a stunning site to visit but the road around the lake is a little harrowing. We were very glad that we made the last minute decision to do it clockwise!! Many vistas to pull off and take pictures. I highly recommend that you do this on a sunny day. We did stop off at just about all of the scenic points. Make sure to go down Pinnacles Road and see the Pinnacles - amazing!!We were a little disappointed that the boat trip was not running. I think they are fixing the dock or something so make sure that it's up and running if you go. We also had lunch at the lodge which we did early (a little before noon) so we didn't even have to wait for a table. The food was good and reasonably priced. Make sure your camera is fully charged. You won't be able to stop taking pictures!! And no picture will really take in the entire vista. Make sure to go to the visitors center and watch the film before you go.

We now live in Wyoming and have a dude ranch and have a keen awareness of guest service. I have to say this morning we met one of the surliest employees it has been my displeasure to come across. He was working the North entrance station at about 10:30am. When we pulled up I handed the required $15.00 and offered, ""is that the right Amount?"" Without a response he took the cash and handed us a map. We asked, ""so guess we won't be able to use the Cleetwood trail to the lake?"" He nastily replied, ""No that's been closed for some time"" . Next we asked....""can we go around to the rim village on the east as it looks like the west rim road has a closure?"" His retort was..."" yes but it's a long drive."" This gentleman was obviously totally burnt out and is absolutely the wrong person to be greeting people at the entrance station.

We then decided instead to take the Trolley tour around the rim. As we went to purchase tickets, we were told that an automobile club had showed up, so they agreed to use all the Trolleys to take them in the AM, so no more tours were available until the afternoon.

We made reservations a year in advance to stay at the lodge, the young man at the desk was amazing, excellent customer service beyond the call of duty. Forgot his name but he is listed as cashier #221. We stayed in room 204 with a view of the lake, which was stunning at night with the stars. The room was clean and comfortable.We ate at the dining room our first evening, our waitress was Piper, we tried a salad and clam chowder for starters. Salad was okay other than the blue cheese crumbles tasted stale but the clam chowder was not pleasant at all.We ordered the salmon and a stuffed chicken dish, the food was quite salty. We at at the dining room for breakfast the next morning, my two eggs were very watery and not cooked to my order, the hash browns were wet and watery as well or greasy. Joe was our waiter.2nd morning we went for the parfait, it was good.2nd night for dinner we tried the appetizers, with Samantha as our waitress. She was great, again, went beyond the call of duty regarding customer service. We had the spinach, artichoke dip and a mushroom artichoke tillamook cheese quesadilla. Perfect ! This was the best food we had during out stay. We also tried Annie's but did not enjoy the quality of that food at all, along with the long wait.In general the food was okay or adequate and pricey however, we did our research and were aware of reviews on this so , we did not let it spoil our trip.We had a great time on our Trolley tour with Bill as our Driver and Pat as our female National Park Ranger. They provided a wonderful two hours of history and scenic views.Spectacular.. This tour takes you completely around the Rim of the Crater. Seat cushions are provided which adds a nice touch of customer service.We hiked up to Watchman's peak for sunset, took the boat tour one morning, this too was a fabulous experience with another Park Ranger who had done her homework. Great information provided from all. It is a long hike down and back up to and from the boat launch, not for everyone, so be sure you look into that if you are going.

Crater Lake National Park,"We visited Crater Lake for two days. I loved the hike along the Rim Trail on the West Rim because there are so many great views of the lake!! The first day, it was raining, 30 degrees, heavy fog and light snow. We hated to waste the day, however, attempting to hike in thick fog will guarantee falling straight into the lake! We did one short hike, 1 mile loop, near Mazama Village called Godfrey Glen. It was away from the rim (no fog) and the trail looped through tall beautiful firs. You also get a great view of the pinnacle rocks.The following day, we came back to beautiful, bright sunny day, with blue skies! It was such a beautiful sight. This was the same day of the Hike/Bike the East Rim (East Rim closed to vehicles) and also the National Public Lands Day, so it was a free day to all visitors. We started our hike from Watchman Overlook starting at 9:45AM. We hiked up Watchman's Peak. The climb up could get you a bit winded esp if you are not regularly active, but the switchbacks help. Coming down, we continued along the Rim Trail. The trail would go through pine trees, open up to clearings, and you'll have several opportunities to see great view of the lake along the trail. There are some parts of the trails that will have rocky ascents or descents, but nothing too strenuous. We continued along Rim Trail to get to Discovery Point. We past three overlooks off of the freeway thinking the third overlook was already Discovery Point Overlook. Turns out, there's about a quarter of a mile hike more from the third overlook to finish up at Discovery Point. From the third overlook, we headed back to Watchman and drove to Rim Village for bathroom break, etc. Then we decided, hey, let's hike back up towards Discovery Point to finish incomplete hike this morning! That took about 2 hrs for 2 miles roundtrip. All along the way, there are several great viewpoints of Crater Lake. At this time of the day (1-3p), you will see the best reflections of the outer rim of the east side in the the lake. I would rate the Rim Trail from Watchman Overlook to Rim Village as a moderate hike, and I am an occasional runner and I practice yoga regularly. We completed this hike (Watchman Overlook/Discovery Point Overlook RT, drive to Rim Village, and Rim Village/Discovery Trip RT) from 9:45A - 4PM.

Crater Lake National Park,W0W!!! Crater Lake was our primary destination after an Alaskan cruise. I have always wanted to see this volcanic wonder of the world. I was not disappointed!!! The drive to Crater Lake from Roseburg was about 1 hour and scenery was awesome!!! Our prior research revealed a Rim Drive around the Lake. Beautiful deep blue color gleamed from the water's surface!! The shade of blue reminded me of the gemstone sapphire. We stopped at a number of over views along the drive and noticed our shoes were covered with volcanic dust. Pumice and scoria rocks were everywhere!!

Crater Lake National Park,"My husband and I visited Crater Lake National Park on a Sunday. We read on Tripadvisor that the north entrance got backed up with vehicles trying to enter the park. We arrived at the North entrance around 10 am. There was one pay booth open and we waited 15-20 minutes to get in. The cost was $15. We stopped at several of the road side parking lots around the rim and enjoyed beautiful views of the lake and surrounding area. After lunch, the park became a mad house. The parking lots filled up and people were parking in the road, making the road a one lane. Vehicles were fighting for right of way. We even saw a couple different groups of people getting into a fight over parking at the lodge. When we left the park (on the north side), the line to get in was very long (3.2 miles) and two pay booths were open. We saw a couple of the bedroom rooms in the lodge. They were not fancy but looked nice and comfortable. I love our National Parks but I will not return to this one.","September 28, 2016",Too crowded on the weekends,631,"Austin, Texas",4

There are other views as well - you're situated above clouds, and there are trees and a couple of small waterfalls along the way. The West side of the rim was under construction, and I was there on a Saturday. You can only imagine the amount of cars! Totally worth it. I camped at the Mazama Campground, which is only about seven miles from the rim. It's the end of September, and I woke up with ice on my tent... be prepared for the weather!

Roads narrow with no bike path to speak of, and towards the end it turned into gravel & dirt as they are repaving! Not a fun trip thru the park, but the lake being so picturesque made it worthwhile.

Crater Lake National Park,"It's been about 55 years or so since I last visited Crater Lake... and, needless to say, things have changed a lot -- and for the better! The roads are much wider with lots of pull-outs, there are more observation points and interpretative information, and a number of trails have been added.Our visit was on Saturday and Sunday, in mid-September. We arrived at the North Entrance about 2PM and drove the West Rim road, stopping at many of the pull outs to view the lake and at Rim Village, before leaving the park at about 5:30PM. (The East Rim road was closed on Saturday because of a bicycle event.) Saturday was sunny day, and with the sun to our backs in the west, the lake looked like a jewel. Because near-freezing temperatures had been forecast for Saturday night, we opted to get a motel room outside the park instead of camping. (That turned out to be an excellent choice because the campground turned out to be full anyway.)Sunday morning we returned to the park about noon to drive the East Rim road, which had been re-opened. We were much less impressed with the East Rim road as it is much longer, and the roadway is mostly on the outside flanks of the cauldron (as opposed to close to the rim and the lake). However, the Pinnacles Overlook, Phantom Ship Overlook, and Cloudcap Overlooks were good, but with the sun across the lake in the west, there was a lot of glare off the lake and the lake did not appear nearly as beautiful as it did from the West Rim the day before.] Unfortunately, by mid-afternoon storm clouds began forming. And a strong cold wind was blowing across the lake towards the east (which I understand is common.) We left the park about 5PM, by the North Entrance.During our trip, we hiked a few of the easy trails:* Lady of the Woods Trail, near the park headquarters, is a self-guided tour. Trail brochures are available at the trailhead. This trail and guide material discusses the original headquarter buildings and design. After several stops and reading the associated materials, we decided this really wasn't something we were interested in and returned to the trailhead.* Castle Crest Wildflower Trail, on East Rim Drive, near the park headquarters, is also a self-guided tour with trail brochures at the trailhead. We enjoyed this easy hike along a flower-plant filled meadow and small creek even though most of the flowers had already bloomed. The end of July and beginning of August is the recommended period to see the wildflowers in bloom. We would definitely do this walk again.* Pinnacles Overlook Trail, about 7 miles off of the East Rim Drive. We enjoyed the this easy walk and viewing the geologic formations.On a future trip, we may try a few of the moderate, longer trails such as the Watchman, Sun Notch, and Annie Creek Canyon. Tips:* Try to time your travels so that the sun is behind you as you view the lake. This will give much richer colors to the lake and will not create glare.* It's often windy -- sometimes very windy. Take a windbreaker. Also, protect your camera from blowing dust and sand as much as you can.* Make advance reservations at the campground if you are going to camp. Reportedly, it fills up early. * We recommend the West Rim Drive over the East Rim Drive if you have limited time. The West Rim Drive is a lot shorter, easier to drive, and has a lot of pull-outs for photo-ops.* Be prepared for different weather than is forecast.* Restrooms are limited and not at all overlooks, trailheads, and other locations that you might expect them to be.","September 21, 2016",The West Rim Road is gorgeous on sunny afternoons,60,"Fairbanks, Alaska",5

Crater Lake National Park,"September, right after Labor Day is an exceptional time to visit. While still crowded, it wasn't bad and the weather was exceptional, making for some outstanding views. We camped in the park and actually drove around the lake twice, getting different views at different times of the day. There are so many turnouts and viewpoints, that sometimes it seems silly to stop at each and every one. But, if time allows, do so. Just slightly different viewpoints give each stop a different perspective, entirely. We are still going through all our photos - so hard to pick the best ones. They're all good!

Crater Lake National Park,When going to Crater Lake try to make certain that it is on a clear sunny day. You will see the most wonderful blue water that you may ever see. Watch the video. It's short but the story of Crater Lake is fascinating. Take the time to make the drive around the crater and stop at just about all the stops. It's really worthwhile. You can pack a lunch as there are places to stop and picnic. Or you can eat at the lodge. You must visit the lodge and walk around there. It's fun to sit on the porch on a rocking chair overlooking the lake. Visit the observation deck also. They have a boat that sails around the lake. We've never done that. We don't think they should let boats on the lake. You may have to reserve a long time in advance. ,"September 19, 2016",Must see!!!,37,"Fort Myers, Florida",5
Crater Lake National Park,"I've visited this park many times over the past twenty years and it is indeed one of the great jewels of our national park system. Its remoteness is a plus for keeping the crowds down.Unfortunately, this time my plans forced me to visit during Labor Day weekend. It was nearly a 45-minute line to pay admission at the entrance kiosks. Parking at the major sites was difficult. Hiking trails were jammed. The scenic drive around the lake was not seriously affected by the crowds. I know that some of the more popular national parks are facing serious crowding problems at times but was surprised to find it at Crater Lake.So, as the other reviews make clear: this is a glorious, magnificent spot. Everybody should visit it at least once. And if it has to be on a holiday weekend, that's better than nothing.

It's $15.00 per vehicle unless you are super invested & have a national park pass. I would always suggest to check for fires in the area - it can put a damper on your trip due to smoke hanging in the crater. I always suggest to check the webcam on their site.

Crater Lake National Park,"It is the only of its kind in America and deepest lake of all and is worth going there. In comparison with other places in the US National Park System, I would say that this park management needs to be improved. Only one booth (left booth) open on Saturday and there was a long line of twenty cars. Sometimes the right booth open but it takes only exact change in cash. The ranger was so ill manner that he threw the receipt and map thru the passenger’s window even I extended my hand to take them. Lack of clear signs, crowded parking and the road construction make the visit very hazard. The visitor information had long queues and gift shops are small. If you can only spend less than half a day there, I would suggest go to the East Rim for the Phantom Ship Overlook (you can see most of the Crater Lake there) and the Pinnacles. If you have time complete the loop, go to the Watchman Overlook.

The views from every designated location are simply breathtaking. It will take a while to get there but it is worth the trip. The gift shop is not amazing so save your money on the tchotchkes. Leave plenty of time to get there especially if you're not used to driving curvy roads, and to pay the entrance fee. I thought about it if you arrive before 9 there's practically no line to get in.

Crater Lake National Park,"We were so happy to have enjoyed this beautiful place on a beautiful day. The beauty is absolutely amazing. We hiked the Garfield Peak Trail which picks up right behind the Crater Lake Lodge. It took us 2 hours and enjoyed lake views that just got better and better. It is rated moderate online and strenuous in the info you get from the park ranger. I would think it is more in the moderate range. It was 3.3 miles round trip. We would recommend bringing your own lunch into the park and enjoying it on one of the hikes. We tried to have lunch at the lodge and it was a 1 1/2 hour wait so we went to the building you get to first that has a rather large gift shop/quick food items and spent over $15 for 1 hotdog, 1 PB & J sandwich, medium soft drink and a small bag of chips. It was not well run and the wait there was long too. Avoid all that and bring your own.","September 11, 2016",Amazing,68,"Mesa, Arizona",5
Crater Lake National Park,"The amazing thing is that Crater Lake looks just like the pictures and it is still hard to believe it when you see it. There was a group of bikers traveling the Rim Drive while we were, and I had to agree with one of them who said that he ""wanted to keep going, but he had to stop each time he came to a look out."" Those of us who didn't have to worry about losing momentum on a bicycle had no hesitation at all stopping every time. Another stop to make is the Information center. Talking to the ranger after looking around is definitely worthwhile. I was amazed at some of the things I learned from him. The most amazing fact was that the last snow this year was on July 15th - the last one which closed the road was on July 1st. So don't assume that the way is clear because it is summer! We had glorious weather in September!","September 11, 2016",It is hard to believe,8,Connecticut,5

Once at the bottom of the trail you can swim off the shore or jump off a large rock into the water. It was a very hot day when we were there so the chilly water felt wonderful. You can drive around the entire lake taking in the views along the way. The lodge and gift shop are worth the stop as well. If you plan ahead you can also take a boat ride on the lake.

Driving along the rim, taking a few short easy hikes and stopovers was all we could manage, but even this was wonderful. Would have liked to be able to hike down to take the boat tour, but old knees prevented this. If you're in good shape, do it! We also had a delightful breakfast at the Lodge. Be warned, however, it is tough to find a reasonable place to stay unless you make reservations way in advance.

Crater Lake National Park,"We unfortunately did not get to see the blue of the lake due to fires in northern California. We were held up by construction along Rim Road. But that was well posted and there's not much anyone can do. I can't say enough about the Junior Ranger Program. Our 6 yo granddaughter sat through a very age appropriate, informative talk by a Park Ranger and earned a patch. She also completed the 6-12 yo booklet provided at the visitor center and earned a Junior Park Ranger badge. The Park Ranger sat down with her and reviewed her entries. Then she was sworn in. We were all very proud of her and she of herself. This is just such a good program for children encouraging them to learn while working toward a goal.","September 5, 2016",Junior Ranger Program,6,"Montesano, Washington",5
Crater Lake National Park,"In 1968, a subject in Miss Giovannoni's 5th grade class at St.Vincent was geography. For some reason I was fascinated with learning about new places and one place that stuck out in her teaching was Crater Lake, Oregon. For 48 years I dreamed of going to this spectacular place to see the deepest lake in North America. I read articles, books, and even followed the park web cameras on a regular basis. This past week, I finally made it to Crater Lake. Pictures cannot capture the beauty of this amazing place. The views, the water, and the night sky!!! If you have a bucket list, Crater Lake needs to be on it!Note: If you are from a place where you don't drive a lot in the mountains, driving in the outside lane on Rim Road can be a little intimidating, especially on the East Rim. If you aren't use to big cliffs with no guard rails, I would drive clockwise around Rim Road.Also, spend the money and stay at the Lodge!","September 4, 2016",Bucket List!,37,"Bedford, Indiana",5

Crater Lake National Park,"We are a couple of Seniors and rather limited in our ability to hike but we thoroughly enjoyed the sightseeing opportunities the park had to offer. Our Golden Pass came in handy as usual so admittance was free. We spent about three hours in the park and the drive from Roseburg OR took about 1-1/2 hours over a very good road which had light traffic. There were many, many places to stop and view the lake without having to walk any distance. Wonderful photo opportunities. We did not take the boat tour due to the climb but were very happy with the viewing points. There are lodges and gift shops in the park and plenty of restrooms. It was a nice, sunny day with comfortable temperatures in the high 60s. Park was not crowded (Friday, Sep 2)and driving was easy except for a short distance where you are guided through with a lead car due to extensive road repairs being undertaken. Wait was about 15 mins to go through this area which was gravel. Appears there are trolleys in the park to take you around and we saw your buses for those who don't want to make the drive to the park.Lake is gorgeous deep blue and the surrounding scenery is lovely. Did not see much wildlife other than tiny, friendly chipmunks and a few birds but we understand there are many other animals species in the park.Definitely, put on your list to visit!","September 3, 2016","Blue, blue Crater Lake",13,"Palm Coast, Florida",5

Crater Lake National Park,"OK, so whoever designed the planet didn't put Crater Lake anywhere convenient. I've lived in Northern California for 30+ years and I never got around to seeing it until recently, because it's a several hour detour from I5. But finally last July, we had some extra time, and I convinced my wife and 3 small kids that it would be worth the trip.For my wife, the most memorable thing, the reason she thinks the detour was worth it was the amazing rich blue of the water--but you only get that on a sunny day.The kids liked the novelty of staring down into a defunct volcano, and they also thought Wizard Hat Island was pretty cool. But you're up on the rim, and you can't get down to the water (or at least not easily). We also had a July snowball fight--it stays cool up there year round, I guess.The lodge is pretty neat too--an old depression-era building.","August 30, 2016",Probably not worth it on a cloudy day,11,San Jose,5

Saturday and Sunday is a good time to visit to miss the road construction that is going on right now. Earlier the better.Make sure you get the brochure(newspaper) of the park. It is a great help in planning your time around the rim. You can download this in advance which makes planning your time better. There are several highlights that should not be missed. The Pinnacles Overlook is well worth the time. Watch for the chipmunks and lots of birds in this area. Pumice Castle is a better look at Phantom Ship in my opinion. Watch for Red tailed hawk and Clarks Nutcrackers in this area. There is always a different view at the more than 30 scenic pull offs. Plan a short or even a 3-4 mile hike.

Crater Lake National Park,Was not sure if the Park would be open mid March due to snow but as luck would have it they had just clear the south entrance up to the crater the day before. (Call the Park beforehand if going during the snow season) The long trip up through the south entrance was incredibly beautiful with walls of snow 12-15 feet high lining the roadway which winds it's way up the mountain. Visitor center was all but buried in snow but open to the public for short video of area and information on the National Park. Going further up you reach the rim area which offers a simply awe inspiring view once you clamber over 20 foot high snow banks. The south entrance is usually the only one accessible during the winter months with the others closed due to heavy snow fall.

Crater Lake National Park,"I've been to Crater Lake several times and returned this yr. What a wonderful place. I camped in the Mazama camp ground and it's very nice. There are many trails to hike on and a rim drive with many pull offs to enjoy one spectacular view after another. The park changes through the day because of the light and what you see in the morning can be different than what you see in the afternoon. The water is so blue that it doesn't seem real and the landscape is ruff and beautiful so make sure you take your camera because you'll never get enough pictures. If camping not on your plans, there's your typical national park inn to stay in. Beautiful, historic, majestic and another must see. It has a display that tells about the inn and park with pictures and artifacts like menus. The park is usually not crowded through the week but it can be on the wkends so plan accordingly.

Crater Lake National Park,"We arrived at the park through the South entrance after driving for a number of miles through the surrounding national forest. The cost of admission is $15/car unless you have a National Parks pass. You are provided a map of the park and a Crater Lake newspaper as you enter. Use the Crater Lake newspaper you are given to plan out your day. It highlights when ranger tours are given and where they meet. Note that if you want to take the boat tour you need to book ahead of time. They do not run all year long and therefore are a difficult ticket to get.Crater Lake itself is spectacular. The water is a deep blue and the steep walls all around the lake give it a very unique look.You can easily spend an entire day, or more at the park if you hike any of the numerous trails which vary from easy to strenuous. And in addition to the lake the surrounding forest is impressive.Be sure to take in at least one ranger tour whether it be hiking, at the overlook, or on the trolley.

Crater Lake National Park,"This is such a beautiful national park. We arrived around 10 and were lucky to get a bus shuttle to the cleetwood cove trail - the parking lot there is closed currently as they're improving it, so you can't drive there yourself. From there it was a short (if pretty tiring at this altitude) hike down to the boat jetty (most of the people on our bus were taking a tour) or the only beach area on the lake. This is a very rocky 'beach' and you really have to clamber down to the water. But the water itself is just the most stunning deep blue, and crystal clear. You can see many feet down before it fades to cobalt depths. Swimming was delightful as the water is cool and refreshing after the dust and heat of the trail. Just lovely - would definitely recommend to anyone coming even remotely near.","August 23, 2016",A must see if you're in southern Oregon ,51,,5
Crater Lake National Park,"You've seen the photos. The clear blue-it's-almost-too-blue color to the Lake captured in photographs and film. While I am typically unimpressed with color (the green of Ireland, the white of the Taj Majal) the color of this Lake is truly a wonder to leave you breathless. It is color I have yet to find in any bodies of water across the country and the world, and its uniqueness is something to behold.There is, of course, the loop around the Lake, where you can drive around, stop and get of out of your car to reverie. There are also some interesting hikes along the way, both beside the Lake and a bit removed, including a scenic walkabout of the staff cabins and buildings of a byegone era (just be sure you bring the mozzie spray).While the Lake and the hikes are beautiful, and sufficient reasons to check out Crater Lake in addition to the history, please do yourself the favor of checking out the skyscape during your visit. With the elevation and being removed from civilization, the sky and stars are magic to witness. I drove out to the rim about 11 pm in July, and was able to witness not only the stars and planets, but the orange full moon slowly rising over the horizon, dangling above the dome. Even if I had a nighttime camera, I don't think that beauty and wonder could be more imprinted on my memory.","August 23, 2016","Amazing, beautiful, and required visiting for all jaded travelers",14,"Portland, Oregon",5

Crater Lake National Park,"Spent a day hear after driving from Bend. Lots has changed since I last visited as a child. I can recommend the ""shuttle"" tour around the lake ($24/person senior) as it is difficult to drive and actually see anything with the narrow twisting roads (no guard rails). Book this ahead of time on-line as there are limited spaces on the hourly departures. Tour takes roughly 2 hours, and of course you can drive back to any place in the park to see more or do a little hiking. The film at the visitor's center is excellent to learn about how the lake was formed. Helpful ranger staff and lots of opportunities for talks, short hikes, and presentations from the ranger/naturalists.

Many people were taking a dip - 59 degrees. Well worth the trip!","August 22, 2016",One of the most beautiful places you will visit!,8,"Chicago, Illinois",5

Crater Lake National Park,"The park itself is incredible; the color of the lake and the natural beauty of the surrounding area is well worth the long trip to the top. I would recommend that you bring a lunch as the food in the gift shop cafe is good, but very overpriced.

Crater Lake National Park,"This was a wonderful day. Lots of sunshine and the most magnificent views are everywhere you go, all around the lake from every vantage point. unfortunately on the day I was there we were not able to access the lake itself, which is said to be breath-taking. I guess that means I'll have to go back, wouldn't mind that at all.","August 22, 2016",Amazing views and more,13,,5

Crater Lake National Park,"Seeing Crater Lake has been on my Bucket List for a long time and I finally made it and it was definitely worth the trip! I so enjoyed the movie at the Visitor's Center that described the geology of the region, the formation of the lake, etc. There are many hiking trails throughout the park and other sights to visit including waterfalls, a wildflower garden area, and the Pinnacles which are concrete-like spikes left over after the volcanic eruption of 7,700 years ago.

Crater Lake National Park,"We love this park and consider it one of the best places in our country. This year we visited in August with the express intent of hiking the Cleetwood Trail and getting a new tee shirt. Much to our surprise, the west rim road and the trail are scheduled for maintenance starting on August 15, 2016. We were there on August 14th and it was crowded and the construction materials and equipment was already in position and ready to get started. The maintenance is needed and I am sure it will be even more wonderful and safer next year.","August 21, 2016",Under Construction,20,"Burnet, Texas",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We visited Crater Lake National Park during our 9 day visit to Oregon and it was definitely our family's favorite place to visit. It was absolutely beautiful. Our favorite part was hiking on the Cleetwood Cove Trail down to the lake. Once we got to the lake, the water was cold, but refreshing. The day we were there it was sunny and warm and many people were jumping off the high rocks into the lake. Unfortunately we were not able to get tickets for the boat ride on the lake, but instead enjoyed wading in the cool water and sitting on the rocks along the shoreline. We would definitely like to visit Crater Lake again.","August 20, 2016",Awesome!,20,"North Oaks, MN",5
Crater Lake National Park,"My husband and I visited this park as a day trip since we had evening plans. It worked out fine but there are some things you should know beforehand! I recommend reading up on other comments/advice! We drove up from Ashland in the South. You will lose phone service which can be a little unnerving if you don't know where you are and if you're not certain that you are going the right way. I think it would have been helpful if there had been a few more signs along the way since you drive many miles in (beautiful) forest before you get to the lake. We arrived at the entrance at 8:30 am and there were very few people there. Entrance fee was $15. The lake was stunning and made me think of so many questions about it's formation and water content. There were many stops along the way and we took advantage of most of them. In my research, I didn't find any hiking trails that stood out and there were cautions that trails might not be available d/t snow. However I found interesting reviews on Toketee Falls which was about 30 miles north of the park on highway 138. We decided to hike to those falls. After a fun hike, we drove back down to CLNP and did the other half of the route. By now there was quite a line to get into the park. Luckily we were able to swing into the outside lane as that booth was for reentry! By the way, there was no phone service to Toketee Falls either. We pulled up at Rim Village for a late lunch but the parking lot was nuts. We decided to skip it and headed down to the Annie Creek Restaurant. It was much less crowded there and we put our name on the list to be seated. It didn't take us long to figure out that service at this place was super slow and it would take us a very long time to get our meal. We decided to check out the Mazama General Store that was located across the parking lot. I noticed that they had sandwiches there so we decided to grab one to go and skip Annie's. This was at 2 pm. I suspect we made a good choice. We were very glad we arrived at the park as early as we did as it was pretty full by the time we left. Other than Beckie's Cafe on hwy 62 and the Rogue River Viewpoint, there didn't seem to be much between CLNP and Ashland other than driving through beautiful forest. And that was just fine!","August 19, 2016","You just have to see the blue water with your own eyes, but this park takes some planning!",319,"Frisco, Texas",4

Since the park encompasses 286 sq. mi., you will drive several miles from the entrances to reach Rim Village at the top of the volcano that houses the lake. Enjoy the beautiful scenery along the way. There is a scenic drive (Rim Drive) all the way around the lake, as well as trolley tours around the rim that run every hour beginning at 9:00 a.m. Buy your tickets in one of the trolleys near the visitor's center at Rim Village either the day before or the day of your tour. Rim Village has a gift shop with a small cafeteria service as well as coffee and other drinks. There are many hiking trails in the park, including a section of the Pacific Coast Hiking Trail. See park rangers for maps and information. This park is suitable for families with children. There are a number of Junior Ranger activities available. The visitor's center has a short film about the park. Ask a park ranger for the schedule.The views of the lake are absolutely breathtaking.

Crater Lake National Park,"A twisty 2 lane mountain highway took us past forests, rock outcroppings and the Park gatehouse to the the end of the Crater Lake Park road. Buying a National Park pass online and reading their online summer 2016 newspaper helped make the most of a short 5 hour Park visit.Arriving before 10 AM gave us a parking spot halfway from to the end-of-the-road Crater Lake Lodge after by passing full lot at Rim Village entry. (By the time we were ready to leave - 3:30 pm -a short line of cars was waiting to take our spot. People in cars were idling & waiting)Bought in-person 2 tickets for the 3 hour+ Rim Road Trolley narrated tour. Efficient, worthwhile and fun way to painlessly learn all about Crater Lake, development, ancient history and scientific research and efforts to preserve / save purity of lake waters.Snug bookstore building had a friendly ranger help a school girl with Junior Ranger quiz on park experience & observations as Ranger also manned the single cash register. Nice selection of wildlife & hiking books.Walk to Crater Lake Lodge. Bought cold ice tea & beer from restaurant espresso bar for take-out to Lodge veranda. Snagged 2 Lodge rocking chairs...these are popular places to sit. Enjoyed cold drinks while taking in the Lake view.Skipped the 1.1 mile downhill hike to lakeshore. Not interested in making switchback uphill trail return back up to parking lot in 90°F heat and no shade.Instead took picnic lunch assembled from grocery fixings. Searched for picnic tables. Found them by walking..on the hill behind the parking lots...behind the Community Room outbuilding. Several picnic spots, some in sun, others in shade. At 1:30 PM, several spots open. Our lunch in the shade with mountain breeze & bird song was peaceful/ relaxing. Most tourists stayed around snack bar, lodge, bookstore or parking lot enjoying the views around Rim Village as this part of park is called.Sadly no time for hiking, although the late afternoon guided Ranger walk up Watchman's Tower to fire lookout station building would have been our choice. Winter's 3-day snow camp guided tour with Rangers doing snow-bound Rim Road sounds intriguing. Watching the 22 minute Park video at the main Park info center (located part -way along the mountain road) was good way to cap off visit.

Crater Lake National Park,"BEWARE!!! We made a HUGE mistake. We drove hundreds of miles, got to Klamath around 4 p.m., and teens wanted to drive up to Crater NP to see the lake and stay in motels very near NP or IN the National Park. Got drove up an hour to find 1) ZERO cell service (we had T-Mobile, Sprint, and AT&T providers on 3 cell phones). NOTHING. Our Garmin GPS did NOT work either. 2) then we found that the small lodge was sold out and so were all the campgrounds! 3) We had no way to telephone or use our Google maps. Lady inside restaurant gave us a paper list (outdated) of motels VERY far away. We drove to dumpy town 30 miles away, and the 3 motels were sold out. So we ended up driving 68 miles back to Klamath. We wasted over 3 hours that night and the bugs/mosquitoes back to Klamath were nightmare! Couldn't even see out our windshield. This National Park does NOT have enough lodging at all. They need to build several more lodges-especially since motels are an hour or more away. I suggest you come early in the morning and drive around the lake. 3) typical government mis-management- they had LONG road delays since they were ripping up the road in several spots. Hello! Whey didn't you do this in April BEFORE tourist season, or do this in early September after tourist season? We had 30 minute delays twice. 4) We also hiked down to the lake (boat dock) and they are closing this trail for ONE YEAR I think August 15? Why? This park is very mis-managed with poor cell service. The hike back up was very hot and steep. Bring plenty of water and snacks in a back pack. Also- the boat ride did NOT have a roof or shade and you have to make reservations ahead. I don't recommend it for old people or people who are out of shape as the hike up is harsh. This NP needs to add parking lots, lodges, and improve internet/cell service!!! The signage needs to be improved- it was poor also. The service in the restaurant was NOT good since they did not have enough cooks or waitresses- several empty tables yet we had to wait 20 minutes. . Very good food though.","August 15, 2016","WARNING!!!!- BE PREPARED= Lodging/camping sold out, non-existant or very poor cell service, long road delays. Come early",112,"San Diego, CA",4

Crater Lake National Park,"Having visited more than 20 parks over the years, this was easily one of the best. The setting is stunning and it is easy to get around and appreciate the beauty of this one of a kind natural miracle. The rim road offers many vista views and easy pull offs to take photos. There are also several hiking trails easily accessible with a range difficulty and variety of beauty. The hike to the water fall was easy and it flowed well, even in August. We did a lake boat tour and it was a nice mix of information and chances to simply enjoy the beauty of the surroundings. Note the hike down to the boat is easy, but getting back up is work. Bring water and sun screen as you will need both. I was most struck by how well they did in designing the park. They did an amazing job of keeping the man made things out of view and there is little pollution to see or disturb the view.

Crater Lake National Park,"Nothing prepares you for the shear beauty of Crater Lake. A large, extinct volcano filled up with crystal clear blue water this is the deepest lake in the States. At 10,000 feet, the climate is sub-alpine and still covered in deep snow (this was May). The long, winding drive up the crater side is both treacherous and beautiful at the same time. But once at the top the view is stunning. The inevitable gift shop and cafe does not detract from the view. They had cleared enough snow so we could drive around the outer lip of the rim and take in the full experience. Worth visiting at the foot of Crater Lake is the souvenir shop, with books and a short film about the crater's discovery. (annoyingly an Australian woman was credited as being English - oops). We stayed in nearby Klamath Falls in order to have decent accommodation as booking something nearby is not recommended: they are over-booked, over-priced and very basic.

My 12 year old who has never seen more than flurries really enjoyed out July 3rd snowball fight, and we were all in short sleeves and shorts no less! Our first view of the lake was breathtaking. It was all I imagined and more, the lake is so still and so blue, it doesn't even look real and pictures cannot begin to do it justice. We were not able to drive the whole rim due to the Eastern side being closed because it was still under 7 feet of snow. We stopped and saw every overlook we could get to though and it was incredible. I never been to a bad National Park sites, but this is one of my favorites. If you hike the Garfield Peak and the Cleetwood Clove trails you can see the highest and lowest points in the park.

There are several vantage points to stop and look at the lake with a cafe/gift shop in the Rim Village. There is also a lodge to eat at and stay the night but it is expensive. We brought our lunches with us and bought drinks and ice cream at the cafe (that was expensive enough). You could easily spend all day here, so leave early because there is also road work going on near the top right now. We were so happy that it was good weather the day we went up.

We learned, though, that only about half the tickets sold have people showing up to collect them (they probably get lost or held up in construction) so they do sell them, starting one hour before the boats go out.

We were so happy when when left that we had lucked out. The places on the south side of Crater lake are on the other side of some very scenic and slow curvy roads.  While at the park we were able to drive all the way around the rim! Every site is spectacular and different. We also took the boat tour and learned so much about the lake and had such a funny driver. So worth the effort, but it is 1.1 miles straight down...and back up...there was snow all around, but down on the lake it was warm, much warmer that on the rim.

Crater Lake National Park,"As we ascended up to Crater Lake, the views became more and more impressive. When Crater Lake first came into view, the only word that came to mind was ""Wow!!"" Its size and beauty was remarkable. Crater Lake is famous for its deep blue color and its impressive clarity. Crater Lake was a volcanic mountain, Mazama, that became the deepest lake in the United States after a massive volcanic eruption 7700 years prior left a deep basin in its place. Centuries of rain and snow filled the basin forming a deep blue clear lake. We visited the lake in early July and lots of the trails were still closed due to the snow. There was still plenty to do and see. If we come back, (hopefully one day), we would try to come in August.","August 1, 2016",Impressive,344,"Boynton Beach, Florida",5

Crater Lake National Park,"Our expectations were that we would be underwhelmed with Crater Lake since we'd researched it so much and heard about the ""blue"" color everybody mentioned.Even though we were ""ready"" for it, the blue got us too! Sounds cliche but pictures do not do it justice.If there isn't a ""crater lake"" blue color, there should be. That color deserves its own name.We were on our way back from CA to the Portland, OR area. From I-5 north and we just cut north up hwy 97 out of Weed, CA, left on hwy 62 through the gate ($15/car) and took the West Rim Road. Probably took an extra hour travel time (not including hanging there for about 45 minutes) with this side trip. You can park right on the rim at several view points. It wasn't that crowded at about 3:30 on a July Saturday afternoon. The images were taken just steps from the car. We will hike down and take the boat tour next time for sure. This little trip was just an appetizer. (smoke in the images is from a nearby wildfire).We just continued on West Rim Rd right out of the park. Turned right on hwy 138 and left on hwy 97 and continued our travel north.From 97 north we took hwy 58 west towards Eugene (and back to I-5) and stopped about half way at Salt Creek Falls. That was very impressive and easy as the falls view point is like 1/4 mile off of hwy 58 and only a 150 foot walk from the car.This whole side trip added about 2 hours to our drive back to Portland.

We made reservations well in advance for the boat tour and found out when we tried to get our boarding pass that our tour was cancelled do to a boat having mechanical issues. Understandable but no notice given. Luckily we were early enough to book a ride on a later boat. If that hadn't happened, the tone of this review would be totally different.

There are no rivers feeding into the lake so the water is super clear.

Crater Lake National Park,"Drove here on a road trip for one day / night. Got lucky a nabbed the last spot at the Mazamas camp ground. Spent all day driving through, hiking the trails, walking around the park. Absolutely breathtaking views. Never new that blue could have that shade / hue to it. Must dos:1. Walk down, at the very least, to the it dock where the boat tour leaves from. Even if you don't do the tour, you need to get up close to the water. You are allowed in, so bring a towel, water shoes, etc. water shoes make it much easier to scramble in and out. Water is brisk (duh) but you just have to go in! If you're brave enough, there's a big rock around the bend to the right that people jump off of. It's maybe 15 fee high, but a perfectly clear landing area free of rocks (and with the water so clear, you knows it free of rocks below). 2. boat tourNot the most exciting 2-hour ride ever, but it really is cool to see the lake from below vs up top. It will stop at multiple spots to discuss features of the volcano action, waterfalls, the water, animal life etc. pretty interesting stuff. Best part was we were able to see The Old Man, a giant tree that's been bobbing up and down on the lake since the 1890s. It's a very rare phenomenon the world over, so that's cool in its own right. But The Old Man drifts around the lake, so the boats don't always cross paths with it. That alone made the boat tour worth it. Note: this sells out all day, so don't be surprised if you have to book for the following day. Also, give yourself a couple hours to get around the lake to the trail head. It's a steep one mile trail down (and up!!). Make reservations at The Lodge or at Annie Creek. ","July 27, 2016",Most beautiful scenery wver,5,"San Diego, California",5

Crater Lake National Park,"I will not spend time extolling the unique and stunning beauty of Crater Lake, as that has been done by others repeatedly and well. What I will do is to try to give readers some sense of the difficulties they will encounter in trying to visit this place. The headline is that the facilities at Crater Lake are ENTIRELY INADEQUATE to deal with the number of visitors that it receives. SHORT SEASON. Although nobody can do anything about this, the short season compounds all of Crater Lake’s visitor problems. The road around the rim is typically not completely open until around July 4, and by late September snow can already be an issue. The best bet on timing is probably shortly after Labor Day, when schools are in session.ROAD WORK. The roads going up to and around Crater Lake are in bad shape, and are undergoing extensive repairs, probably for the foreseeable future. Of course, this is all done right during the short visitor season. So expect single-lane roads with pilot vehicles, and the associated 15-30 minute delays, probably on your way up to and around the lake. This season (2016), huge amounts of snow brought down lots of rock onto the east section of the rim road, which did not open until mid-July. Another section on the west rim had a pilot vehicle in operation, as did route 62 coming up the mountain.PARKING/TRAFFIC. This is bad enough at the Steel Visitor Center a few miles below the rim, but it is totally horrendous at Rim Village, where cars can circle literally for hours hunting for an empty parking place. The worst time is between noon and about 2 p.m. I honestly expect someday to see a news story about a violent incident of “parking lot rage” there. The many pullouts around the lake also get filled beyond capacity around the same time. Even those of you staying at the lodge in Rim Village have no reserved parking – you must compete for space with everybody else. This is the most painful single issue in the park.FACILITIES. Compared with most other national parks, the facilities are just pitifully insufficient. The Steel Visitor Center is small, with a tiny gift shop. The visitor center in Rim Village is even smaller – maybe 400 square feet total, with no washrooms. The washrooms at Rim Village are all in one building – and about one-fifth of the size they need to be. The women’s room only had 4 stalls! We didn’t even attempt to get food or beverages up there.None of this is to criticize the people who work/volunteer in the park. I have no doubt that many of these people are doing their best to help visitors have a good experience. But they can only play the hand they are dealt by the Park Service – in this case a bad one.MINIMIZING PAIN. The biggest thing you can do to minimize your pain is to get up to the rim EARLY, like 7-8 a.m. At this time the traffic will be much lighter, and parking will be available everywhere. As the day progresses, it will get worse. Avoid Rim Village after about 11-12 a.m. until about 3-4 p.m. Even pullouts in the remote parts of the lake will be full in early afternoon, so find a good place to hike or sit during that time, or maybe do something away from the crater rim.","July 21, 2016","Unique Beauty, Painful to Visit",86,Indiana,4
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is an absolutely amazingly beautiful place! If you've ever wondered whether or not you should take a trip there, do yourself a favor and go. Before entering the park make sure your car has gas in the tank, camera batteries are charged, and you have some snacks and water, especially if you're planning on doing any hiking or otherwise. Other than at the south entrance there are no services. Most importantly, do yourself a favor and find an uncrowded spot where you can reflect as you simply soak in the beauty before you. If the entire Rim Road is open, be sure to drive completely around the lake. My only regret is that we did not hike down and take the boat around the lake. The good news is that just means I have to make another to visit. ","July 21, 2016",Touched by the Hand of God,3,"Houston, Texas",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is a unique geological feature. The lake is the result of snow and rain filling a volcano crater. No streams into or out of the lake.

Crater Lake National Park,We had two good days at the Lake. Our daughter and son-in-law hiked up to Garfield from the Rim Village Lodge. They said that the view from the top was spectacular. My wife and I walked around the village and enjoyed the views of the lake. We drove around the rim stopping at the numerous locations to view the lake. They also walked down to the water and they enjoyed it. While they were gone we found a nice view at a stop and just enjoyed the lake.

Crater Lake National Park,"We drive through to Crater Lake from Redmond. Took about two hours twenty minutes via the fastest route. Annual national park pass allowed us in rapidly as there was a line for those who were paying for the day. The park itself has circular route around it with west and east sides of the crater as focus. We arrived from north access. We did the west side first although both sides are beautiful in their own ways. There are loads of beautiful look out points along the road. Plenty of places to pull off and enjoy both the incredible views of the lake - which are awe-inspiring - as well as those of the surrounding endless horizons of fir trees and mountains. Truly magnificent. We spent six hours at leisure however one could do twice this and still not be done. There are several easy hikes and plenty place for cyclists too. For those who wish to purchase lunch, coffee or curios there is a village with ample supplies to satisfy all tastes. There is also an area on the north east shore to catch a boat trip and see the lake at base level instead of from above. Pictures do not do this gem justice. I have visited loads of beautiful places in the world but this easily ranks on the top five. The deepest lake in the US (just short of 600m deep) and the fifth deepest in the world. And the color blue gets a new meaning when you see Crater Lake. Truly heaven on earth. ","July 20, 2016",Heaven on earth here at Crater Lake,146,"Jensen Beach, Florida",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Visited Crater Lake 7/15/16 and did the boat tour only (3:30). Family of four 49,50 and two teens (16 &18). We all had an incredible time and the beauty of the place was amazing! I would definitely recommend the boat tour as it puts you ""in the middle of"" all the features of Crater Lake. We got there early and checked in at Cleetwood Cove trail and picked up our tickets (had called 2 weeks ahead to purchase--slots fill up quick). From there we drove to the lodge, took a quick peak inside (did not have time to dine there) and then headed to the nearby gift shop and cafe. Parking was a bit crowded--you may have to walk a little. Had a sandwich/chip lunch (cafe is a little pricey and limited, but good) and headed back to Cleetwood Cove. There is some road construction between the Inn area and the cove but it moved fairly quickly--is very dusty so keep your windows up! At Cleetwood we hiked down the trail which took 20-25 min. Some parts a steep and rocky/dusty so I would definitely recommend close-toed shoes with tread. The hike down was fine, but the hike up was definitely strenuous and required a few short ""breathers."" Just take your time! You have to check in again at the bottom of the trail and show your tickets before boarding the boat. For the tour you need a light jacket (preferably water resistant as it gets a little wet when the boat is not ""touring""). They do have a few plastic rain ponchos for those in the front. Also, wear sunglasses, sunscreen, and a hat--the sun on the water is intense--they have a hat box you can borrow from.I would highly recommend this tour.","July 20, 2016",Crater Lake,0,"Baton Rouge, Louisiana",5

Crater Lake National Park,"The scenery is breathtaking and well worth the trip. But plan ahead! Here are a few suggestions:Stay at the National Park Lodge if you can afford to. The historic hotel is a real treat (and usually full, so make reservations early).How long to stay? It really takes two days and nights, or more, to get the full experience.Believe the weather reports! It may be partly cloudy at the base, and snowing up at the rim, like when we were there. Overnight snow (in July), light morning snow, fog, then a sunny afternoon. For us there is no thing as bad weather, just wrong clothes. If the weather report says its snowing or raining, the dress warm and enjoy!Tired of driving? Once up at the rim, the trolley tour is an easy, fun, and affordable way to see it all (except for some rim roads which may be still closed by snow, in July). Hiking is great, but stay on the trails, and don’t go down the caldera or feed wildlife.

Crater Lake National Park,We went to Crater Lake in Oregon it should be the eighth wonder of the world. I have never seen water so blue never seen blue so blue. This is def not a 1 day trip maybe a 2 or 3 day trip. We dared to walk down to the boat ramp and up to the swimming area. My son jumped off the cliff several times and I did get in the water and right back out. The water is freezing. 1 piece of advice check online and book the boat ride well in advance because it sells out quickly. We were not able to get on the boat. We walked up the mountain it was the hardest thing ever. I am not in good shape in fact I'm highly over weight but with the help of my husband and son and several stops woohoo I made it. The best place to stay is in Bend Oregon. It is about 2 1/2 hrs away from Crater Lake. We stayed 1 night and totally regret not staying longer. So check it out and have.

Crater Lake National Park,We visited in late summer 2013 as part of a road trip from Seattle to LA. Our visit was suggested by a cousin who lives at South Lake Tahoe and it really has to be one of the best recommendations I've ever received.There were so many visitors getting around but we didn't interrupt each other all that often and when we did it was actually very helpful by taking each other's family photos.At the top we listened to the Ranger's talks and viewed the NP displays which was a great explanation how this magnificent place came to be. We had coffee in the lodge then made our way around the rim road taking advantage of every scenic lookout and had a picnic at one of these spots.There is a point to park on the side of the road and follow a path all the way down to the lake itself where we had a swim in the icy waters and many were jumping from a rock into the lake far below. Swimming in water this clear and fresh was just an amazing experience.Whilst we stayed in Klamath Falls I noticed there were some great camping spots at the Mazama campground and we had a fantastic dinner at the Annie Creek Restaurant.Crater Lake was one of our earliest stops on our trip yet it was the most memorable stop we had and by far had the most lasting impact upon us.

Crater Lake National Park,"We checked in at the Shilo Inn in Klamath Falls and the next morning after breakfast we headed out to Crater Lake on this Memorial Day Weekend.As we were coming from Klamath Falls, we took Highway 97 and then 62 to the Park Headquarters entrance. There was a $15 vehicle fee (small SUV) to access Crater Lake Park.The complete park route for vehicles wasn’t open during the Memorial Day long weekend. Only the west side of the lake was open from the Rim Village to the North junction. According to the information sheet, the East Rim Drive and the south side normally open up in late June or early July.Our first crater stop was the Rim Village. Even though it was a long weekend, we were able to find parking. We walked about 150 yards (meters) from the building complex (retail outlet / coffee shop) to the viewpoint. After spending about an hour here (including a visit to the retail store) we headed onto to West Rim Drive. From West Rim Drive, there are several vantage points for more spectacular views of the lake. As we continued driving West Rim Drive, on this sunny Sunday, there was still evidence of snow as the ploughed roads created high banks of snow.During late May all the hiking trails were closed because of the snow pack. However, you could rent snowshoes at the Rim Village Gift Shop.There are amazing vistas to see. This will be a good half day adventure if you decide take in some hiking and or biking around the rim during the summer months.I would rate it at 4+ out of 5 for what we were able to see and do.Notes and Tips• Plan your trip according to weather conditions. If it is overcast / foggy, the lake may not be visible. Check the NPS website for current weather conditions including webcam views.• Pick up site information (pamphlets) at the Park Headquarters• Boat tours of the lake are available• As expected for the long weekend, the attraction was busy. We were leaving through the North Entrance and there was a long line up of vehicles (¼ to ½ mile long) waiting to get into the park.• Washroom facilities at 3 stops – 1 before the headquarters entrance and 2 more inside the park – at the headquarters and Rim Village• Food is available at the Rim Village Café at the top.• Be wary of radar on the stretch of highway leading to the State Park• This was day 5 of our journey to Central Oregon and the Pacific Coast. Our 8 day journey included Multnomah Falls, Columbia River Gorge, Painted Hills and Smith Rock. See my reviews.• The 7 Wonders of Oregon is a tourism marketing strategy. The 7 wonders include Crater Lake, Painted Hills, Smith Rock, Wallowas, Mount Hood, Columbia River Gorge and the Oregon coast.

Crater Lake National Park,Crater Lake's blue color has to be seen to be believed. Well worth the drive from any direction. We did the hike down to the lake but didn't find it strenuous with hiking boots on. We were able to get on a 2 hr boat tour as apparently they always leave half of the reservations open for that very day's tours. It was utterly freezing and we had on sweatshirts and rain jackets - in early July it was only in the 40's at the lake!Make sure and bring a rain hat and jacket as you will get VERY WET on this ride. It was worth it to take the tour though our tour guide was rather boring and spoke in a monotone most of the time. The lake and the falls you can only see from the tour were just beautiful. Got a closeup of Wizard Island too and were glad we passed up going on that tour.

Crater Lake National Park,"My wife and I visited Crater Lake National Park yesterday and really enjoyed the amazing natural beauty...just stunning! Our enthusiasm was somewhat dampened by the very marginal services available around Crater Lake Lodge. The lodge looks great and we wanted to have lunch there...unfortunately there was no parking within anything like a reasonable walking distance. Plus construction around the lodge area has temporarily removed dozens and dozens of the already scarce parking places...although very few of them were actually in use for construction while we were there they were roped off and unavailable. OK, couldn't get to the lodge so we decided to try the nearby ""cafe""...which was just a bad joke. It's actually a lightly stocked self-serve place with fewer choices then your average convenience store (I mean that literally!). There is no menu and you can't order anything...you just pick up your $11 cold sandwich choice from a cooler and pay for it...which we did. For a cold case sandwich it was fine, but Subway would have been better.But enough with the complaining about the non-cafe...the park itself is absolutely worth a visit...be sure to bring your camera for the endless ""post card"" worthy views. Check out the Annie Creek Restaurant for a nice, casual real ""cafe-style"" lunch. It's just a bit down the road (near the south park entrance) from the lodge and MUCH less crowded with plenty of parking and a nice gift shop. There are many picnic spots with unbelievable views.All in all, we'll certainly go back to the park...but not to the ""cafe""!","July 13, 2016",Incredible Natural Beauty!

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake on a sunny blue sky day is simply a most amazing sight not to be missed. It's the kind of stunning blue that will stay in your memory forever. If at all possible, stay at least one night at the lodge - it gets booked up early but there are cancelations closer to date, we got a room about two weeks out last week of June this way and it was so worth it (have patience and faith and just keep checking the lodge website, yes everyday! It's not even that pricey at about $200 a night considering the location). The reason to stay there is not just to have more time during the day at the lake, but to see the night sky covered with a gazillion blinking stars. Be sure to hike the Cleetwood Cove Trail down to the boat dock - whether or not you are taking the boat ride. Bring a bathing suit - the water is definitely freezing but the courageous do jump in, if only to scramble ashore immediately. At the very least, dip your feet in the icy crystal clear water.

Crater Lake National Park,"If you enjoy our National Parks like I do, then the long drive to Crater Lake is worth it and this may even be a ""bucket list"" place for you. If not, and if you do not enjoy driving much, then this trip probably won't be your cup of tea. Crater Lake is really a destination. It's unlikely you'll just happen ""to be in the area"". Oregon is a BIG state, especially for someone like me coming from Connecticut. Crater Lake is not near any interstate so if you are there it's because you want to be there. Once you get there, you'll be impressed; especially if it's a sunny day and you get to gaze at that BLUE BLUE water. I approached Crater Lake from the 2+ hour drive up from Medford, Oregon. which is to the SW of Crater. The drive was fabulous. We here in the Northeast are fond of the famously beautiful Kancamagus Trail through New Hampshire but the Kancamagus has nothing on this drive from Medford to Crater. It's a beautiful meandering drive through tall pine tree forests with 10+ foot tall trees hugging the shoulder-less narrow roadway. Stop at the Rogue River gorge viewing area which is opposite from the Union Creek resort. Take some picture and view the waterfalls and then continue the remaining 25 or so miles to Crater. I arrived in June and was surprised to see so much snow on the ground, several feet in places, bare ground in other spots. The snow made for beautiful photo opps. The downside is that the east side drive was closed due to the repairs being done to fix avalanche damage from the long winter. There are many scenic overlooks to stop and take pictures. If you come across areas where parking is difficult, then just drive on down the road a ways and there will be plenty of other places to stop and view and take pictures.","July 4, 2016",simply beautiful,20,"Oxford, Connecticut",5

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater lake has Beene no my bucket list a long time. I finally got to visit on a driving trip between California and Oregon. I came in from Ashland through the south entrance, which was beautiful and had virtually no traffic most of the way in late June. The view from Rim Village is simply spectacular. I was there on a crystal clear day, about 11am in the morning. It's jaw dropping. I recommend getting there as early as you can, because more people and more RV's start pouring into the park after noon. I was only able to drive part way around Rim Drive. A chunk of the east side and all the road to Pinnacles was still covered in snow the last day of June, as were some of the trails I had planned hiking. It seems you can miss some crowds coming early in the season, but the trade off is you may not be able to see all the parkThe view is worth the drive. You'll never see a setting as expansive and beautiful as this one. I can't wait to hang some pictures of that gorgeous blue water on my walls at home.Two tips- One, the two gift shops are run by concessionaires and they have nice things, but the visitor center at the south entrance and the small visitor center building at Rim Village are run by the Park service. Both have small signs that say ""book store"" outside. Purchases there directly benefit the park. Their t-shirts and other items are also cheaper than in the gift shops. And two, start your trip with a full tank of gas. I did, but used more than expected climbing mountains. For a little extra comfort getting back to the intestate, I had planned on topping off the tank, but couldn't because they were out of fuel at the only station in the park. Bonus- it you want to take a look at the pacific crest trail, you can find it just north of the south entrance, on Route 62. There's a pullout with a sign about the PCT, and if you look for the medallion nailed to a tree a little south of the pullout, you can see where the trail enters the National Park.","July 1, 2016",Nothing Short of Jaw Dropping Gorgeous,33,"Carbondale, Illinois",5

Crater Lake National Park,"We entered the park from the North Entrance and the drive was fantastic - the first glimpse of Crater Lake makes you want to pull over immediately and take in the site. We ended up hiking around the rim which is a great way to see different views and aspects of the lake. It was far bigger than I was expecting...it's hard to describe other than to say it is serene - majestic. If we had the time we would have liked to take the boat ride to Wizard Island, And lots of snow, even in very late June. : )Some words of advice now that I learned the hard way:1) It was very crowded and finding a parking spot in the main village was a challenge. If you need to eat, I would try bringing lunch instead (you can eat right there on the rim instead of in a dining room). To be honest, any lunch you bring will be better (and oh so much cheaper) than if you get it there. You can go to the visitor center if you need gifts. If you really need to access the village, you might be able to park a little further away at one of the overlooks instead and walk there.2) I mentioned the snow - it can take a while to clear the East Rim road (they were hoping to have it cleared by the 4th of July) which means only about half of the trails are open, The ranger also advised us travelling counter clockwise on the East Rim road when it fully opened (ie, starting from the visitor center) can be quite nerve wracking as there are many steep dropoffs and you will be on the edge of the road.","June 30, 2016",Inspiring - But if you want to explore the whole park wait until mid July,38,"Lawrenceville, New Jersey",5

Many places to hike and the one access site to the water allows (very cold) swimming and boat tours during limited months. The mosquitos can be bad during certain weeks due to snow melt, so plan accordingly. We camped one night and stayed in the lodge one night. The lodge was wonderful.

There are so many spots to stop as you drive up. We stopped at almost all of them and they were all worth it. When we got to the village we parked and went to the gift shop first. I recommend that you get a beverage at the snack bar and enjoy it from the second story view, especially if it's cold outside. There was snow when we where there, but the roads were very clear. You can get to the second floor by elevator or stairs. Also, there is some interesting information in exhibits up there and not many people. After the gift shop we walked to the rim path. It was so much fun to see this beautiful place and reading all about it. My kids loved playing in the snow. Next time, I would love to stay at the lodge and go on a boat tour.

Crater Lake National Park,"I feel so lucky to live so close to the beautiful Crater Lake. (Which is not really a 'lake,' it is a caldera, the collapsed Mt. Mazama volcano that blew nearly 8,000 years ago.) I often imagine what it must have been like to have been one of the first humans to 'discover' it and what they may have thought. I have visited numerous times over the almost 50 years I've lived in Southern Oregon. First as a young woman with my family visiting from my hometown of Concord, California, then to show my growing children. Then, as a sixth grade teacher I was lucky enough to be able to take my students on our outdoor education field trips. Add five years of doing a Natural Resources Camp with high school students, who we took up on one of their days at the week-long camp at nearby Lake of the Woods, I've probably been instrumental in being with close to 1,000 people at the lake. But, being with one loved one is the best, as I can just soak in the beauty and true 'awesome' nature of the lake without worrying about others. That said, if you are ANYWHERE near Crater Lake, you have to visit! It is open year-round, although the rim drive is only open when there isn't snow on it...usually July through fall, until the snow is too deep to clear. There are numerous hikes to enjoy, including one where you can hike down to the lake, Cleetwood Cove. I used to tell my sixth graders it was one mile down and five up. If you are in good shape you can hike it in a half hour. With a group of kids I used to allow an hour to get back up. I could go on for pages, but I hope this is enough to inspire even one person to make the trip, even if it's a bit out of your way.","June 24, 2016",Truly AWEsome,48,"Medford, Oregon",5

Crater Lake National Park,"The bottom line.... we arrived before the East Rim Drive was open from the winter. There was still a lot of snow up there.However, the snow added some beauty to the landscape which would not be visible in mid summer. So touring the West Rim Drive was great and we even stopped to photograph the snow on the side of the road. When we left for the day the weather forecast was for additional snow that evening!This is a National Park. The entrance fee for a private car is normally $15. I showed my lifetime senior pass and was immediately allowed to enter at no charge. So... you seniors out there.... invest in a lifetime senior national park pass and get into ALL the national parks free! I bought mine several years ago at Acadia National park and it has saved us several hundred dollars in fees.Photos are the best way to comment on this park. Crater Lake was created a only 7700 years ago when a violent eruption emptied the magma chamber of this volcano and then the roof collapsed. Rain and snow has filled it in with water which is now the deepest lake in the USA and about the 10th deepest lake in the world. It is 1946 feet deep at its deepest point (a little more than 1/3 a mile). Oh.... the volcano is not extinct!

Crater Lake National Park,We stopped here on our way to Bend to let our grandson's see and experience this natural wonder of nature. It is almost mid June and there is still lots of snow on the ground. The boys had fun making and throwing snowballs at each other and me too. It was Sunday so finding parking was a challenge.

Crater Lake National Park,"While Crater Lake doesn't offer the same kind of ""attractions"" of places like Yosemite and Yellowstone, its beauty certainly compensates for its lack of much to do. As a matter of fact, sitting on the back porch of the lodge, sipping a drink, and looking at the lake is one of the most serene feelings you can have. Check out road conditions before your visit, however, since some access is closed during winter and spring due to snow. Seeing this park in spring is especially beautiful after a snowy winter.","June 11, 2016",One of the most beautiful National Parks I've visited,53,"Roseville, California",5

Crater Lake National Park,"Just got back from Crater Lake National Park yesterday after spending two days there. The scenery and the cool weather were superb and breath taking but there are a few things you have to know about before going to Crater Lake this time of the year. There were many hiking trails which were closed because of the obstruction caused by the hard packed snow. Not only were some of the hiking trail closed, the northern, and eastern part of rim drive had road blocks to prevent car access. Again, due to the snow. Lastly, there were a TON of mosquitos, especially later in the evening. Make sure you bring a bunch of bug spray and mosquito nets to wear on your head to prevent the swarm. These are the reasons I rated 4/5 instead of 5/5I'll be going back in the summer/fall and see how it goes. ","June 9, 2016",June snow,1,"Henderson, Nevada",4

We went in mid-May to avoid crowds (we hate crowds). There was still snow piled up. The Lodge hadn't opened yet but was getting ready to. The Rim Road was not open yet due to the snow. The gift shop was open===a great selection of all types of gifts and souvenirs. There is a little cafe, too.A Ranger told us that the best time to visit is in September.Stop at the Park Headquarters to watch the short video about the park, the lake, and the volcano.There is a great Lodge in Prospect only minutes away.The North Entrance was closed, but we drove from I-5 on Highway 138 for the best scenic drive (lots of waterfalls).","June 9, 2016",Breathtaking!

Crater Lake National Park,"One of the most spectacular national parks I have been to yet. Was perfect timing with the park also opening the Northern access road on the day we arrived, allowing more of the lake to be accessible. Also being spring there was plenty of snow around, making it even more photogenic!!! We stayed around long enough for high noon, which made the water change to an even lighter blue. Such a great day to eat lunch overlooking the lake.","June 8, 2016",Amazing scenery,4,"Te Aroha, New Zealand",5
Crater Lake National Park,Talk about a gorgeous place to see! It is so interesting to learn the history and learn that this is man made. I think it is worth driving on all the crazy roads that are the sides of mountains and you feel like any minute you can just fall off the road! They offer boat rides and all kinds of things. You can camp or bring the RV which ever interests you. I highly recommend stopping here but do some research to see how you would like to see.,"June 8, 2016",Just beautiful! ,28,,5

Crater Lake National Park,"We visited Crater Lake at the end of April, 2016. It was snowing lightly as we drove up. Unfortunately it was all ""socked in"" , there was very little visibility, and we could not see the lake. However, we had signed up for a snowshoe tour with a ranger. About 20 of us set out and it was like a walk in wonderland. There were about 6 inches of fresh snow; the ranger was most informative. We would walk about 10 minutes, then stop, as the ranger explained about various aspects of the forest, the creatures that live there, the effect of the environment. When we got to the top, it was like magic!! The skies cleared and we got to see Crater Lake. After about 5 - 10 minutes, the clouds rolled in again. But it was an awesome way to spend the afternoon. THANK-YOU, Crater Lake employees!!","June 6, 2016",Winter Wonderland,1,"New Westminster, Canada",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We drove to Crater Lake National Park from Seven Feathers RV Resort in Canyonville, Oregon, the drive is 2 hours 15 mins. We entered the park at the North entrance and exited the South Entrance, which brought us straight to Canyonville, as opposed to through Roseburg, as going to the North Entrance does. We heard about Crater Lake from one of the other guests who visited on Saturday June 3rd so we decided to visit. The drive up is beautiful itself, a two laned highway that follows the Umpqua River, have your camera's fully charged as the view of the rapids are breath taking. Getting to the gate, when the ranger shack is closed, payment is by envelope and drop box. From there it's a nine-mile drive to the lake. I do not have the vocabulary to describe adequately to beauty that is Crater Lake, the caldera is awesome, the views are amazing, and the water is the bluest blue I have ever seen, and that is just at the first view point. There are many others as you follow the contour of the lake on the Crater Lake Highway. There are also many campsites in the park along the highway and I'm good fishing in the river. Next trip we plan on finding the perfect spot to set up camp next to the river. We would have circumnavigated the entire lake, but the Eastern road is still on winter closure, oh yeah, I forgot to mention, plenty of snow in June even though it was 70 degrees outside. So if you like amazing views, a great place to camp, fish, or hike, check out Crater Lake National Park.","June 6, 2016",Amazing views,5,"Manteca, California",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We went late May. Sadly the road around the lake was still shut but I'd think it will be open really soon as the road we went on was mostly clear. There's only about five miles of road you can walk on until the rest is cleared and open, but it's worth it for the views. The lake itself is ridiculously beautiful - one of the nicest parks I've seen in a long time. Bring a camera!","June 3, 2016",Absolutely amazing sight,175,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",5
Crater Lake National Park,"This lake was beautiful, almost majestic. I visited in late May when the snow was still visible. This lake was so peaceful and the water was so still.

The view is Huge & Quiet & very Blue lake & raw nature. Many of the trails and some roads within the park are closed due to too much SNOW. We even walked on snow to the overlook & very COOL!!

The trip north from Klamath Falls was beautiful with scenes of ranches with cattle grazing, far off white top mountains, and a very deep glacial canyon. Once we were in the park, the sun glizened off the snow leaving such a contrast between the blue of the lake, the green of the pine trees, and the white top ridges above the lake. It is a must see on any bucket list.","June 1, 2016",Wow! What scenery!,19,"Kingsport, Tennessee, United States",5

It's absolutely breathtaking. You can just sit there staring at the scenery and not get bored. The crater lake lodge at rim village has free coffee in the morning and they have chairs out back where you can sit and enjoy the views. Make sure to catch the sunset, sunrise and see the lake in daylight. The colors of the water seem to change depending on where you are. So walk around the rim to get majestic views.

Crater Lake National Park,"It seems madness to write a review on a NP; one that we have visited before but with the snow and the paucity of visitors, this NP is probably the most picturesque you will visit. You simply can't take a bad picture of the lake and Wizard Island and even with the east rim closed, the views from the west rim are spectacular. The snow depths on the way to the rim (from the North entrance) in late May were up to 14 feet high so hardly surprising that it had only opened the week before; a fact I was very grateful for as I had originally planned on a 'mere' South entrance visit to Discovery Point.You will see a NP with more wildlife (Yellowstone), more drama (Glacier) and more grandeur (Yosemite), but I doubt you can beat CLNP for it's simple majesty.","May 31, 2016",Simply Gorgeous,31,"Suffolk, UK.",5
Crater Lake National Park,"At times in May the ranger says, ""The fog and cloud are on the lake. You can go up, but you won't see anything."" This was not one of those days. The sky was blue, the wind minimal, the temperature ""warm"" and the view was spectacular. This can be shown only in pictures so I will attach a number of them. Since it was not a week-end, although it was Memorial Day and I was there early in the morning - before 10 am, the crowd was minimal even at the Rim Village. This day, the lake was a Perfect mirror and if you took a slice of the lake and the mountain and inverted it, you would have a hard time knowing which side was up.

Crater Lake National Park,"We went here at the end of May which is around the time the north entrance opens. If you are driving in from the north I highly recommend going in this entrance as there are 2 magnificent stops to take the most amazing pictures on Rim Road. (I think even better than the view from the lodge). The hiking trails are still closed around this time (which we didn't know) so I would look into that if this is something you want to do. I'm assuming they open around June 24th as this seems to be when everything else (tour related) in the park opens. There is also a boat ride to Wizard Island which we weren't able to do this early in the season but it sounds like that would be pretty amazing. The views with snow on the ground are ABSOLUTELY amazing so I wouldn't let the cold weather stop you from going. If you are worried about bears, have no fear, there were only 40 in the park (as we were told). Really the only wild life we saw were small birds and some squirrels....and one chipmunk at the north park entrance along with a million mosquitos. The mosquitos were not at the top of the mountain but I'm assuming that was because it was cold, so if you go during the hotter months, take bug spray! We were attacked for the two minutes we got out of our car to take a picture by the entrance sign. We only saw one gas station in the park... near the southern entrance, co-located with Masama Village, about 7 miles south of the lodge. There seemed to be 2 restaurants located in the park (one in the main lodge and one near Masama Village) and there was another fixed structure near the parking lot of the lodge that said they had snacks but we never went in there so I don't know what they offer. I recommend you book early and stay in the lodge if you can. The other lodging area doesn't have lake view. ","May 30, 2016","Beautiful, must see",12,,5
Crater Lake National Park,Yesterday me and my girlfriend traveled to Crater Lake National Park. We left from Albany Oregon and arrive at the north entrance. The trip only took 3 hours and 20 minutes and the weather was perfect. Most of the road from the north down to the south side of the park along the rim was open. Much to my surprise this time of year usually there is not access along this road. Other than a very congested crowd at not only the ranger station andthe gift shop (and most spots along the way) it was a perfect day to see the most beautiful lake in the world. I would recommend visiting this summer because there will be much more access for much longer period than normal. The only complaint I have is the park was not ready for such a overpopulated weekend and some rest areas were not well kept. Still one of the most beautiful places in the world and a must-see if you are in southern Oregon.,"May 30, 2016",Amazing and Accessible ,36,"Albany, Oregon",5

There are many waterfalls you can stop by before heading up to the lake. We done the rim drive and each view point that we stop and looked at have different shades of blue.

We hiked Watchmen Peak and the Pinnacles Overlook the first evening, then we did Garfield's Peak, Mt Scott, and Cleetwood Cove the second full day. All trails had something to offer - from the panoramic views on top of the peaks to the cliff jumping/swimming at the bottom of Cleetwood Cove.

I was fascinated by the Ranger Program that we attended in order for our son to participate in the Junior Ranger program which focused on the newt and shrimp competition in the lake.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is one of the most beautiful, incredible sights I've ever witnessed. I would recommend it to anybody and everybody, and yes, it's worth the drive!

Crater Lake National Park,The lake is a long ways from anywhere but well worth the drive especially in the summer when it is much cooler at this higher altitude .

Crater Lake National Park,"We went during the early summer, and there was still snow on much of the mountain, but the roads were all cleared. There were lots of places to take amazing pictures (which i unfortunately lost my sd card...long story), and it was not overly crowded either. It is one of the few places I tell people they really should plan on visiting.","January 26, 2016",Pictures don't do it justice,3,"Clarksville, Tennessee",5
Crater Lake National Park,"I had visited Crater Lake some fifty years ago, and finally got the chance last fall to go back. It remains, of course, one of the great wonders of the continent and one of the gems of the national parks. I won't spend time here rhapsodizing about the blueness of the lake or other such things, because I'm sure everybody else here has spoken of that. What I will do in this review is give an idea about the specific things I did so that maybe somebody else can pick out adventures that suit them.My original plan was to spend the better part of two days at Crater Lake, but that didn't work out. The summer was far enough advanced before I was able to commit to a time frame for my vacation and when I could there was no longer lodging available in the park, besides the fact that I had to rearrange my itinerary to get lodging near other things I wanted to see. So it goes. In the event I had basically a whole day, arriving at about nine and having to leave by six to get to my motel before dark. It wasn't nearly enough for this park. Just saying.I of course drove the loop road around the lake and stopped at all the overlooks and took pictures of Wizard Island and the Phantom Ship etc., etc. This is probably pretty much mandatory for a first visit and it was certainly worthwhile. The lake is beautiful and ever changing and there is something different to see at every stop. The topography is such, however, that for most of the loop drive the road is out of sight of the lake. It's still a pretty drive, but bear that in mind. Also note that it takes much longer than one would think to complete the loop drive. The traffic can be bad, and making frequent stops at the viewpoints, however worthwhile, eats up time. I also ran into congestion from a search and rescue effort at the north end of the park, which did not help matters. I never did hear what that was about. I stopped and walked three places along the lake. The trail to the viewpoint at Sun Notch provided my first view of the lake this trip, and it was worthwhile for a short, albeit steep, walk. I also made the hike up to the old fire lookout on the Watchman, which is one of the highest points on the rim and provided magnificent views, but also did for my knees. it's pretty steep. One of the funny things was that there was, at the time, a forest fire just north of the park and I got a good look at if from the fire lookout. Finally, I walked about a mile out along the rim west from Rim Village, which was pleasant, albeit crowded. I have to mention that there is a very nice museum at Rim Village which is tucked underground and is fairly easy to miss but is well worth a visit.Two other things that I did: I drove out a peculiarly straight (especially for mountain country) spur road to the Pinnacles and walked a very pleasant out and back trail past this geologic feature to the park boundary. This trail is easy, level, and picturesque. The lake isn't visible, but in the canyon along which the trail runs are numerous grey spires of eroded volcanic rock which are very interesting and a little eerie. I also walked along the Lady of the Woods Trail near the old visitor center near the south entrance. This is also away from the lake, but it is a pleasant ramble through the woods which highlights the architecture and design of the park service buildings along the way and how they were designed to blend unobtrusively into the landscape. It was the one place in the park that day where I was alone on the trail, and that was something of a relief. The Lady of the Woods is an unfinished and somewhat enigmatic sculpture of a female figure begun some time ago on a large boulder along the trail. It alone made this short walk worthwhile.I suspect that taking the tram around the lake might be a valid alternative to driving the rim drive in one's own vehicle, but I can't really comment because I didn't do it. I also regret not making the pilgrimage down the Cleetwood Trail and taking a cruise on the lake. I did that fifty years ago with my parents and it makes for a fond memory. With the time I had, however, it would have been the only thing I got done that day, and the pull back up the hill on my old knees would have assured I wasn't doing anything else that day even if I had had the time. That's why I wanted to spend two days. Oh, well.","January 24, 2016",Still just as blue,112,"Anchorage, Alaska",5

Crater Lake National Park,"I visited in winter, so only the Highway 62 entrance was open, but that worked perfectly because I wanted to do a loop from Eugene Oregon to Crater Lake via Highway 58 and 97, and then on to Medford Oregon on Highway 62, then back home via Interstate 5. In summer, you could easily add Klamath Falls into the mix, also on Highway 97. This is a must see park, the lake is I think the deepest fresh water lake in the USA, and also has some of the most clear water in the world. In winter, it is a wonderland. But do be careful on the roads, it is snowy and icy, plan your day trip for the middle of the day, be out of there and where you are going well before dark. Be sure to do your souvenir shopping at the Visitor Center, the bookstore (which has lots of things other than books) benefits the park non profit, and the staff at the store at the lake view point (which is run by the park concessionaire) were terrible, not helpful and bordering on rude.","December 9, 2015",Must See National Park - Do a Loop Trip Highways 58 & 97 & 62 plus Interstate 5,314,"Groveland, California",5

Once on the rim, the beauty to behold is unreal. You can seriously look at hundreds of pictures and videos but to experience in person takes you to another level.

At first I was a little disappointed that I was there in October when the tourist season has generally ended and there were no real programs going on, but then I realized that I was so fortunate to be there at a time when there were very few other tourists. I was able to see the lake with no boats, or anything disturbing its peacefulness. It was really a sight to behold. I drove around the Rim Drive, and I had a hard time pulling myself away when it was time to go. I hope that I have the chance to visit again.

Crater Lake National Park,"We recently visited on October 9th,2015 on the last weekend the historic Crater Lake Lodge was open for guests. The park is beautiful, and I highly recommend taking the Rim drive. It is about 22 miles long. Give yourself at least 2 hours to drive around it, more in the busy summer months, to see the many viewpoints, turnouts, and short hiking trails to lake views. We stopped at the Phantom Ship overlook, a very short hike to wonderful views, and Cloudcap, a very easy viewpoint which you don't even have to get out of your car to see. The Pinnacles is an area of sharp volcanic rock formations in a canyon like setting, midway on the Rim Road. You will have to detour off about 7 miles in to see them, and it is not well marked, and there is a flat foot trail for good viewing. Be careful here if you have young kids, as there are many steep drop offs, but it is interesting and different. The Gift shop and cafeteria leaves a bit to be desired, but it is typical for a National Park. Don't expect too much in the way of food choices, so pack your own lunch and snacks so you won't be disappointed. If you don't stay at the lodge, you should at least visit it. There are fantastic trails (mostly flat and wheelchair accessible) nearest to the lodge that sits on a cliff above the lake. We stayed at the lodge for 2 nights and were not disappointed! The reviews we had read said many bad things about it, like it didn't have T'V's and the food at the restaurant was not good, etc., so my expectations were not high. The lodge was completely renovated in the mid-1990's but the rooms still have the quaint feel of an old lodge so don't expect a 5 star hotel room here! But the room was so comfortable, with a very comfy queen bed, three windows that opened to the wonderful breezes outside, a chair and desk. The room was quiet too, and we were on the first floor. We made our reservations about 2 months in advance, and we did not have a lake view, and a woman who arrived without a reservation checked in in front of us, got a lake view room on the spot! We tried to have our reservation changed several times prior to our arrival to get a lake view room, but it really is all about good timing. A little unfair but that is how it goes! The lodge had excellent food and service. Our server, Arthur, was knowledgeable about the Park and the lodge as well. He was considerate and attentive. The food was excellent. My husband had the duck and I had the lamb chops. They also offer their own Crater Lake Label wines which were tasty. We only ate dinner and the lodge and brought our own food for breakfast and lunches in a cooler. You must make reservations to eat here in advance. Make sure you talk to a live voice when making reservations to eat at the lodge. We got a recording 3 times and never a return phone call. I had to call several phone numbers in order to make my dinner reservations. If you don't have a reservation, they serve folks in the beautiful sitting room at the lodge, which had two very large working fire places, with many chairs to sit around. While not as nice as sitting at a table, at least you could have a meal in a great setting. A night, the stars are awesome and we were easily able to walk outside the lodge to take photos and take it all in. IN the morning, sunrise was easy to witness as it was only a short few steps out of our hotel room to the ledge. The lodge employees (who are not National Park Employees) were friendly but some of the younger ones were not as knowledgeable about the park as I thought they should be(perhaps they should study a bit about it in their spare time so they could answer questions a bit better). We didn't take the trail down to the lake bottom, which is where you catch the boat ride, as it was closed when we visited but I hear it is well worth it, although the walk back up is very strenuous. We made a horrible mistake of leaving a bag containing camera equipment in our room at the lodge when we checked out on Sunday Morning. We did not notice it missing until after our return home. The items were returned to us safely and completely only a few days later in the mail! They have very honest and efficient employees, and for that I will give them 5 stars!!!!!!!! The only downside on this trip was the difficulty of finding phone numbers for the front desk of the lodge. Once you have that, keep it in a safe place. They use a central reservations system and you many not be able to speak directly to those who work on site.","October 16, 2015","Spectacular views, a historic lodge, many photo opportunities and hiking trails!",18,"Portland, Oregon, United States",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We were driving between Bend and Ashland and made the detour to see Crater Lake. It was a gorgeous day, with few clouds and no smoke. The lake is as pretty as shown online, but feel that's not enough to justify a long round trip drive. Enjoyed the geological variety of the rim. We did the loop road, admired the lake and did most of the side attractions. We especially enjoyed the Pinnacles Trail - as much if not more than viewing the lake after the 3rd stop. IF we were to go again, we'd stay the night in the lodge and do a few of the longer hikes.","October 16, 2015",Scenic but not worth going a hours out of your way to see,63,"Issaquah, Washington",4
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake was the highlight of our trip to Oregon. The views are just beautiful. It's well worth the long drive south to experience this natural beauty. The trolley around the lake narrated by a National Park ranger is worth the money. The ranger was very informative which added to the value.

Crater Lake National Park,"It may be off the beating path a bit, but visiting Crater Lake National Park is a definite MUST for travelers. It is one of the most well kept secret places to visit that compares with Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon. This phenomenal crater is well worth the drive and the volcanic collapse that created this ""crater"" became the deepest lake in the United States (over 1900 feet deep) and the cleanest lake (clarity) in the WORLD! The 33 mile drive around the lake is amazing. We took the park ranger guided trolley tour for $27 each and was well worth it. It was a 2 hour journey that took us to multiple stops around the 'crater' as well as much information about how it was formed, who helped preserve it, and the numerous facts about it. We sure are glad that this country had some very intelligent people that helped persevere at getting places like this protected by our government in the early 1900's. Glad this place, like so many of our other National Parks were preserved for the generations in the future to enjoy. I've been to all US states except 2 and I can personally say visiting this was as enjoyable as some of the other desired National Parks to visit.

Crater Lake National Park,"Hmmm, maybe our expectations were too high after reading all the fabulous reviews but we were not that overwhelmed with the lake. Yes, it's pretty and it's blue but we did not think it was that spectacular. We drove 2 hours from Bend to see it and quite frankly, didn't think it was worth the drive. We drove the Rim Drive and after about the 6th scenic turnout, we were ""laked out."" We continued stopping at the viewpoints, thinking it might get better. I was actually more impressed with the craggy rock formations than the lake. If I had it to do over, I would drive directly to the Rim Village to sit on the porch at the lodge, walk the rim trail there and explore the historic architecture of the village. Then drive to Watchman Overlook and hike to the top for a fabulous view. We didn't think it was necessary to drive around the entire lake to appreciate it. Perhaps a hike to a view rather than all the driving would have been better for us. However, if you do the Rim Drive, it is best to do it clockwise, so the scenic pull-offs are always to your right and you don't have to cross traffic. We did not find the road to be scary at all.

Drive from Portland to Bend is beautiful, it took us around 3.5 hrs. From Bend it took 2 hrs to reach Crater lake. In October the cold wind is not so easily bearable. Day was sunny and the time we reached was around 11am, the lake waster was reflecting the sunlight, so those area was not seen blue, but wherever the shadow of rocks fell, the water was blue and it was amazing view. Road to crater lake and the rim drive is scary though, no boundaries to the road, risky to drive, slight slip will be deadly.","October 10, 2015",Scenic Natural Historic Volcanic Spot,5,"Portland, Oregon",5
Crater Lake National Park,"The short trip once you leave the main road is all uphill but once you get to the top, you won't be disappointed. There are amazing views from many spots along the rim. On a sunny day, the lake is an amazing blue color. The best pictures will come with the sun behind you when looking at the lake so depending whether you go east or west first, remember to take most of your pictures with the sun behind you. The road is mostly smooth and curvy but can be quite nerve wracking in some spots (narrow, no guardrail and steep drops). You should allow a min of 2-3 hours to circle the lake. There is a very interesting film on the history of the lake at the visitor center which is shown every 30 min. There was no smoke smell or reduced visibility because of recent forest fires.","October 9, 2015",Well worth the trip,218,"Moncton, Canada",5

I've seen all the good reviews, and maybe we got too excited about it, but when we saw it, first, it wasn't as deep a cobalt blue as we expected, and not quite as picturesque. It was beautiful, but I'm just not sure if it was worth the trip. Maybe it was a bad day for the crater, maybe too much dust from the wildfires, but the photos we took were much more beautiful than what we actually saw. Considering the long and slightly exhausting drive to get there, we felt a little disappointed. Sorry!","October 7, 2015",Too hyped up for us,24,"Singapore, Singapore",3

We arrived early evening before sunset and went to the Watchman viewpoint with the sun setting behind us. It was a bit of work out walking to the top before the light faded but it was well worth the effort. Great views of the lake and the sun setting through low golden cloud clinging in the mountains behind us. The light played great tricks with the views to keep us entertained. We went to the campground for the night which is in a nice location and was very peaceful.and then set out to drive around the rim, first heading east side to take advantage of the sunlight. Absolute amazing views of the deep blue clear water [I mean really blue] and contrasting islands and shoreline. It's one of those places you just want to sit still for a while in silence and soak it all in, incredible. The road around the rim was not bad at all and we drove it in a 28ft RV with no problems.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is fantastic! The first view of the lake is guaranteed to wow you and you'll be awed many, many times while viewing the lake from Rim Drive. Plan to spend at least one full day in the park, even though it's difficult to find good lodging in the park or nearby. The crater (caldera) filled with rain and snowmelt in the years after the collapse of Mt. Mazama some 7,700 years ago following a major eruption. The lake has some of the cleanest water in North America, leading to the incredible blue colors of the lake.If you have limited time in Crater Lake National Park, the ONE thing you must do is experience the Rim Drive (either in your own car or the park trolley (for a fee). The views of the lake from Rim Drive are fabulous! You can't possibly not be awed!! Suggest to make the circular trip in a clockwise rotation, which will put you closer to the rim (and the best views) at all times. The park newspaper suggests seven highlights to focus on while making the Rim Drive: Discovery Point, Watchman Overlook, Cloudcap Overlook, Pumice Castle Overlook, Vidae Falls, Pinnacles Overlook, and Phantom Ship Overlook. They also suggest 2 to 3 hours for the 33-mile loop, but we took much longer! It's really that fabulous that you'll want to maximize your time. Every view is different and breathtaking! Take lunch/snacks and water, as the only places along the drive with food and drinks are at the Steel Visitor Center and Rim Village. We also enjoyed hiking the Pinnacles Trail and up the Watchman Peak trail, which provides fabulous views, especially near sundown.

Crater Lake National Park,"I enjoy early morning road trips that start at six in the morning. The ability to have the peace and quiet to enjoy your surroundings are well worth it. During the time of this visit, the snow was slowly melting and the roads had been cleared just enough to make it to the top of Crater Lake. While traveling to the top, there were some scary moments as the road narrowed in places while in others run off from the snow melting was a warning to slow down. You must keep your eyes on the road otherwise you will be one with nature and not in a good way.There were some areas that were closed off to hikers and cars. Always stop at the visitor centers. The rangers are knowledgeable and will give you the most updated information to make your visit a safe and enjoyable one.Once I reached the top, I had to park near the lodge and walk back to the most spectacular site I had ever seen. The snow on the ground enhanced the richness of the blue in the water. It was nature showing off her best features. I walked around several areas that were closed off to cars but not foot traffic to gain a different perspective of the lake. I was not disappointed.","October 2, 2015",Crystal Blue,177,"Lenexa, Kansas",5

I was disappointed that we couldn't drive all the way around the park since it was my first time there, but feeding the squirrels sunflower seeds made up for it! The Lodge is a fun place to visit & rest your feet in the row of rocking chairs on the lodge deck. Great place to drink hot chocolate on a crisp fall morning & enjoy the spectacular views of the lake! There are some interesting historical displays inside the lodge & two big beautiful fireplaces!

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is such an interesting place. We had read up on the park before our trip, and were amazed at the depth of the lake! It really is the bluest water I have ever seen. We read the park newspaper, which listed the ""HIghlights of the Rim Drive"" and made a point to include all of them in our trip. These were Discovery Point, Watchman Overlook, Cloudcap Overlook, Pumice Castle Overlook, Phantom Ship Overlook, Pinnacles Overlook and Vidae Falls. You will learn and see many interesting things, like the volcano in the lake (actually a volcano in a volcano). Wizard Island is actually a cinder cone that erupted within Crater lake! One thing that we weren't aware of was that there were 2 days in September that a major section of the Rim Drive was closed to vehicular traffic, and only open to bikers and hikers. We would have been sorely disappointed if we had arrived on one of those days. Either I missed this on the NPS website or it wasn't posted yet when we planned the trip about 6 months ago. My advice for any faint of heart drivers would be to take the Rim Road in a clockwise direction. Then you are closer to the lake and further from the drop off edges of the road. We took the counterclockwise route, and the driver definitely has to keep their eyes on the road at all times.","September 30, 2015",The bluest water I've ever seen!,147,"Wausau, Wisconsin",5

Every year, Crater Lake shuts down the east rim to cars on one Saturday (this year, they did two), so that walkers, runners and cyclists can enjoy the scenery without worrying about cars. The majesty and beauty of the lake is unparalleled when you have the opportunity to climb to the vistas and see everything vs. dealing with clogged pulloffs with cars. This year, the park staff and volunteers set up water stations along the way, complete with snacks, which was very helpful.

The beauty lies in about everything - Its color, crystal clear water, serene and different view from each location around rim drive and none the less its history of formation. Of course RIM drive is must, however I completely enjoyed the cleetwood cove hike to the lake, jumping off of the cliff, swimming and boat tour. Boat tour was really informative and its the only way you can get closure look at the islands. We entered from North entrance, there were few road work going on but its manageable.

Make reservations before you get there (internet search for Crater Lake boat tours).You have to (get to?) hike 1 mile down to the dock (only access to the lake at all) and it's steep and can be slippery, but it's doable and worth it.

The lake is great viewed from all sides. Unfortunately it was cloudy today so we didn't get to see the water looking blue.

Formed from a former volcano that stood over 12000 feet, this lake is all that was left after an eruption c. 8000 years ago. From the overlook near the Rim Village, you can see across the entire lake and deep into it's crystal clear waters. We've been here in almost every season, the rim road around the lake is only open in the summer (we were just there September 13 and it was still open). During the winter, everything is likely to be buried under 10 feet of snow and you'll only have access to a portion of the developed rim overlooks near the Rim Village.

Crater Lake National Park,"You need to go a bit out of your way to visit Crater Lake, but the drive is so worth it. For one thing, getting here can be lovely, and for another, when you finally crest the rim the sight greeting you is so unexpected and beautiful that it takes your breath away. I took a foreign visitor who was rather dubious that this could be a good place to visit. We approached the north rim through a barren moonscape-looking patch of land and parked just below the rim. We walked up to the rim through scrub and then suddenly the vista of the lake opened before us. It was amazing. Even on a smokey day the view was spectacular. There's not much else to do except hike (strenuous hikes not suitable for smaller children nor people with walking issues or breathing issues), drive around the rim, and take photographs, but for us it was worth the 2-hour detour. Dubious Visitor was completely blown away. There is a small store/village on the rim, and you can book boat tours to Wizard Island.Family warning: small children will be bored. And for heaven's sake watch them. There are some viewing areas that aren't as safe as they could be. And....if you're not comfortable on narrowish roads think twice before you drive the rim.

Crater Lake National Park,"Most of our national parks are amazing and this one is no exception. Mount Mazama erupted 7,700 years ago and the crater subsequently filled with water, creating the deepest lake (1,900 feet) in the USA, with the cleanest water of any large body of water in the world. The crater is nearly a perfect circle of volcanic rock cliffs of black, brown and orange, and is surrounded by largely coniferous forest laced with canyons, streams and meadows. The rim drive is awesome with tons of pull-outs to view the lake, and the boat tour is well worth the price and the steep hike into the crater. There is no motorized way of getting to the water, so be aware that taking the boat tour involves hiking a steep trail to the water and then hiking back to the rim after the tour. Fit hikers can make it back to the top in 20-30 minutes, but less fit folks take 45-90 minutes to do it. The facilities in the park have varying hours of operation depending on the season so it's wise to check ahead of time - we arrived on September 8th which was the exact date when the hours of operation of the restaurants and shops got reduced. Wildlife that was abundant in September included golden-mantled ground squirrels, grey squirrels, mule deer, grey jays, Clark's nutcrackers, chickadees, dark-eyed juncos, brown creepers, and gulls on the lake that I couldn't identify from the rim. We did see some elk in a meadow but only once and at a long distance. There are black bears, mountain lions, and even wolves in southern Oregon now, but they are all secretive and unlikely to be seen in the park unless you're hiking a lot in the back country.","September 12, 2015",Deepest and cleanest lake in the USA,31,"Micanopy, Florida",5

The whole rim was open when we went. Double check that access before you go. Also double check the weather as it got down to 37 degrees.

The trails are okay. It is fun to hike down to the lake itself (our favorite part of the trip); be prepared- it is pretty rigorous. Other trails did not wow us. August is the busiest month, so I was surprised/disappointed that they decided to conduct major road repairs in August. This detracted from our experience. We saw two deer, quite a few chipmunks, and too many crows. Trails are very dusty and the air is a little thin at this altitude. Asthmatics should have their inhalers handy. It takes several hours to reach Crater Lake. It was nice to do once, but we won't return. Other national parks and many state parks offer a better overall experience.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is truly one of the natural wonders of the world. The lake is simply stunning from virtually every perspective and the sheer size of the ancient caldera overwhelms you. There is a ton to do regardless of your physical abilities. However, if you're an avid photographer or simply wish to see the lake and rim in the best possible light make sure to plan your trip carefully. My suggestion is to drive the east rim in the morning when the soft light illuminates the western side. Ideally, you'll also visit Cleetwood Cover in the morning when the sun is still off to the east allowing for great vistas to the south and west. Finally, there's no better way to see the lake from the west side than late in the afternoon when the sun is behind you. It seems to light up the lake with its irredesecent blue color. The Watchman's Overlook (and ideally hiking up to Watchman's Peak) provides the best view, particularly of Wizard Island. Finishing off the day with dinner in the main dining room at Crater Lake Lodge is a perfect bookend to your day at the park (bit be sure to make an advance reservation).","September 2, 2015",Simply stunning - but plan your trip carefully,1472,"Toronto, Canada",5

The deep blue hue of the lake is unforgettable - driving along the rim in summers (the only time the entire drive is open) lets you appreciate the lake from various vantage points. A short hike up Watchman's peak gives you a great view of the whole lake whereas the short but steep Cleetwood Cove trail leads you right to the shore. Tip: Book accommodation well in advance.

Crater Lake National Park,"I always heard Crater Lake was beautiful, but when my eyes first gazed upon the lake at the top of a mountain nestled inside a huge crater formed by a volcano that blew its top thousands of year ago I was in awe! It's one of those experiences that's hard to explain with words. Not only was the lake huge, but the water was an amazing deep blue color. The drive around the rim of the lake was spectacular and offered many places to pull over and enjoy the views. I guess the drive around the rim took a couple hours. Fortunately, I wasn't the one driving, otherwise I don't think I would have made the drive, since I have a fear of heights and it seems so many of these National Park roads out west have a lack of guard rails, not to mention shoulders, either. Crater Lake also has a variety of hiking trails, some of which will take you down to the lake where you can catch an excursion boat to the island. The lodge and visitor center has a restaurant, but you have to get there early to make a reservation. It was totally booked the day we were there.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater lake is a jewel of a park! It is absolutely gorgeous and the nicest part is that it is accessible to everyone regardless of your fitness level. You can sit on the porch at the lodge and marvel at the scenery or you can hike and climb or ride the rim and stop at scenic areas. Everywhere you look there is beauty. If you are able, do make the trek down and up to take a ride on the lake...it is a different perspective from being on the rim and just as beautiful. We were fortunate to go in July and the days were clear with blue skies. We spent 3 days here and never ran out of things to do or see. The sunsets were amazing! there is a fee to get into the park or you can use a National Park Pass. There are places to eat in the park both fast food and otherwise. A bus is also available to take you around for a fee. Portable restrooms are available throughout the park. If you are going for just a day, do get there early as parking can be a problem and the lines to come into the park can get long.","August 25, 2015",Crater lake just takes your breathe away!,483,"Ridgefield, CT",5
Crater Lake National Park,"A friend and I recently visited Crater Lake National Park, and what a jaw dropper! The history of this national park is fascinating. The drive around 33 mile Rim Drive provides many pull-offs to take-in the beauty of the lake and environs. Forest fires in the area provided a lot of smoke on our 3rd visit there, so much so that we were unable to see Crater Lake itself. The lodge lobby is comfortable with fireplaces and comfy seating. We enjoyed a good breakfast and lunch in the dining room.","August 25, 2015",A magnificent National Park!,9,"Bloomington, Illinois",5

Crater Lake National Park,"OK, so the views across the lake weren't so great because of the wildfires but there's still plenty of fascinating and beautiful stuff to see and learn here. Highly recommend taking one or more of the ranger-led hikes to learn more about the geology and ecology of the region (we took the Plaikini Falls, Garfield Peak, and Sun Notch ranger-led hikes and enjoyed them all). Pinnacles Trail is an easy hike with views of some impressive geological formations, Annie Creek is a bit more strenuous but has wonderful scenery, even our less-than-enthusiastic kid found it worthwhile and named it her favorite hike.We stayed at the Wilsons Cottages at Ft.

Crater Lake National Park,"Wow, crater lake is simply amazing. The lake is such a crisp blue that upon seeing it for the first time, I was stunned. A nick name I heard at the main office ""The Sea of Sapphire"" is the perfect name for Crater Lake. There are plenty of trails and overlooks with picture opportunities. I recommend hiking up Mt. Garfield for some photo ops as well as a good time hiking. I believe there is a boat tour from the Cleetwood Cove, but I didn't take one myself (though hiking down Cleetwood is a good time as well). Crater Lake is a must see for photographers, hikers, or just anyone who enjoys touring the National Parks. It's a bit out of the way in Southern Oregon, but well worth the trip.","August 24, 2015",Sea of Sapphire,79,"Utica, Ohio",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Unfortunately, if you go right now, (August 2015) most of the lake is hidden by the smoke of local wildfires, the north entrance has been closed for days. The lake is still beautiful, you just can't see across it. The various viewpoints on the west side road are still worth seeing and the near part of the lake will show you the wonderful blue color.

Crater Lake National Park,"Note that as of third week August 2015 the north entrance has been closed for two weeks for an ongoing fire (which you can learn more about in the park). This added an hour to our time to get to the park as we were coming from the north. Don't let it discourage you from going though- it is truly a natural wonder, lives up to its billing. On the day we were there it was still clear skies at 5 PM but the view had been lost in the fire haze by 6 PM- probably means no starts to be seen either if you stay in the park. Thought the highest-quality souvenirs were at the Mazama Village store just outside the fee entrance. One of the Rangers told us that of the casual food places, that had the best food too.","August 21, 2015",Watch the fire reports!,96,New York,5
Crater Lake National Park,"This is a beautiful national park and worth visiting at any time except when there is a wildlife in its NW corner. The road into the park from the north was closed when we were there. Lodging anywhere close to the park is hard to find. There's plenty of lodging in Roseburg or Medford along I5, but each city is a couple hours drive from the park, although through very scenic river canyons. The current wildfire smoke makes the views of Crater Lake much less scenic, and irritates the eyes and lungs. It could even be hazardous for the elderly or those with respiratory problems. Fortunately the fire is at a slightly lower elevation than some parts of the crater rim drive, so you can actually get a bit above some of the worst smoke on that drive. Given that wildfires are increasing with droughts and climate change, visiting this park during fire season is not the best idea even though that coincides with school vacation time. There are boat tours although just from one spot that you have to hike 2.2 miles down into the crater to reach. Some of them go to Wizard Island which is the volcano remnant in the lake, and that's the only spot to swim in the lake. During this fire season we could see the boat tours but none stopping at the Island. The water did not look as clean as usual due to fire ash.","August 21, 2015","Beautiful, but visiting now a bit hazardous",210,United States,4

Crater Lake National Park,"I am writing this quick review to say that...YES...you can drive the rim road around the crater. You have to enter the park by 62 on the southwest corner. There was only a very slight haze from the forest fires. The worst was near the village. The park was near empty of visitors, so I have to say I enjoyed our private viewing of a beautiful natural setting. The trolley was running, too.

Crater Lake National Park,"This is perhaps the most beautiful natural wonder in the U.S. The lake is ink blue in color due to its depth (19,00 feet), the deepest lake in the world. It is six miles in width in most places. The views from the rim are absolutely enthralling. There is a tortuous rim drive, which is worth taking. A 1.1 mile trail takes you down to the lake level, where you can take a boat ride for $35. You must, however, book the seat at least six months ahead. The boat ride is thrilling. The water is truly ink blue even from near. The lake is surrounded by virgin forest and rising volcanic hills. Plan on spending at least two full days exploring the area. The lake water is so clean that it is drinkable. It has enough water to give 100 gallons per person to the entire world population.","August 20, 2015",Out of this world,100,"Cape Girardeau, Missouri",5

Crater Lake National Park,"I love the National Parks, and Crater Lake was spectacular. The boat ride with the views looking up and the informative ranger on board was the highlight of the trip, although some will find the very steep 1.1 mile hike back up from the dock challenging. Don't miss the observation point at the Rim Village visitor's center. It has informative plaques as you overlook the lake and a short video depicting how it was informed.There are many trails in the park. And if you have mobility issues or just a short period of time, there are some great pullouts with spectacular views.Go!","August 18, 2015",Must see,12,,5
Crater Lake National Park,"Another gem of the national park system. Although the view is breath taking from the visitors center, lodge and pull offs along the rim drive, the real beauty is hiking down to the lake and taking the ranger guided boat tours. The hike to get down to the lake level is mostly switch backs. The way down is easy, but the way back up is grueling, take your time and go slow and you will be okay. We took the boat shuttle directly to wizard island and spent 3 hours on the island and then the shuttle back to the dock and then the climb out. The wizard island hike to the top of the cinder cone was 900 feet in elevation gain. Once on top we sat down and had lunch and enjoyed the view. Bring plenty of water, hiking shoes and trekking poles are very helpful.","August 18, 2015",Crater Lake National Park; See big blue from inside the caldera.,42,"Onalaska, Wisconsin",5

Our kids were very excited to see the clear water firsthand so we did the hike down to the lake, absolutely worth it. bring your suit and towel and goggles and jump in. the initial cold wears off and you will always warm up on the hike back out. Dont bother with the boat trip unless you like being trapped for hours. We even caught a bunch of the crawdads that were introduced to the lake by the nps and cooked them on our return to the rim for a meal.","August 18, 2015",get out of the car,25,,4
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake National Park was one of the earliest national parks and it was formed to preserve the crater and its incredible lake. Some of the surrounding land is included and there are some minor scenic spots on it as well as some mountains to climb, but this park is basically about the lake. A limited number of small boat trips are offered on the lake. The dock is located down a steep trail from the rim and it is a hard climb back up. Be sure to buy your tickets in the village area across the lake before starting down the trail. The daily boat trips may sell out . Otherwise, one may not venture below the rim of the crater. There is no inflow of water into the lake other than rainfall and snowfall. There is no outflow other than evaporation. So the main activity is to look at the lake. Many viewpoints are road accessible as one drives around the lake. The Lodge is the only building on the rim of the lake and one should visit it even if one is not staying there (reservations should be obtained a year in advance) and sit in one of the rocking chairs on its rear porch and look at the lake. Seeing the Lodge and learning about its history is a worthwhile undertaking. If you see the lake on a sunny day, you will remember the blue.","August 18, 2015",An incredible sight,66,"SF Bay Area, California",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Formed in the centuries following a huge eruption of Mount Mazama 7700 years ago, and the ensuing collapse of the top of the volcano and formation of the present day caldera. Crater lake national park is easy to get to, but it is a relatively long trip. I-5 to exit 30 and turn NE at the end of the ramp - you'll be on Oregon Highway 62. It is 45 miles from Medford to the town of Prospect, on the SW edge of the National Park (1 hour driving time). From Prospect, it is a further 28 miles to Munson Valley Road, turn left onto it and you will immediately be in Mazama Village. Stop here at the Visitor Center, pay your entry fee ($15 per car) - but before you do, you might want to stop at the Annie Creek Restaurant (finest in the park for the money - see my separate review). From Mazama Village it is only 7 miles on Munson Valley Road and the Rim Drive to Rim Village. Follow the signs up the mountainside to the Steel Visitor Center (9 am to 5 pm), and then on to Rim Village Visitor Center (9:30 am to 5 pm). The Lodge restaurant is open from 7 am to 9 pm). Now, I have a wife and 2 daughters who are 'full service hotel' people. When they saw the bathroom, TV and wifi limitations at the lodge, they immediately decided to stay in Medford! Besides, reservations are normally back logged a year in advance. At the Visitor Centers, there are interesting videos about Mount Mazama and how Crater Lake formed. The gift shops are small, but certainly adequate for a souvenir or 2. If you haven't eaten at Annie Creek, there is dining at the Lodge open for non residents (reservations highly recommended) and a small Cafeteria style Cafe at Rim Village. Most people take a ride / drive around the rim, a distance of 33 miles. A bit of advice. Go in the direction where you will be in an outside lane, away from the edge of the precipice! But even then, the driver will not be able to see many of the views. Too many curves, narrow shoulders, pedestrians and bicyclists to drive on your own! And then there is the opposing traffic. Take the trolley instead, $27 per person. Leaves in front of Rim Village Community House. Bring the credit card you reserve online with, because your card will not be charged until the day of your tour! Tram tours last 2 hours, stops at several stunning overlooks, and removes all stresses from the circuit. Even if you go in July, expect a bit of snow here and there olong the rim, the altitude up here is about 7000 feet. Multiple stunning colours and views of this 'deepest lake in the U.S.' At around 1943 feet. Plan on spending a day here, because between the commute, a meal or two, and the Visitor Centers, you will need that amount of time. And one more crucial point. Before leaving Medford, make absolutely sure you have a full tank of gas! Enjoy!","August 18, 2015",A Stupendous Collapse!,833,"London, United Kingdom",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We visited Crater Lake for the first time, driving 4 hours, and it was worth it. The site is beautiful and awe-inspiring, especially when approaching from Route 138 and driving south to the rim. We drove around the crater, a trip well worth making. There is a small souvenir and restaurant area. Either bring food in or eat there, because there are no other facilities in the park. We made it a point to visit the Visitors' Center, and were glad we did. There is a very nice 20 minute film (free) that every visitor should see, about the origins of Crater Lake and its importance.

We spent 2 days / 2 nights at this National Park, and tried to make out the most out of it: - we camped at Mazama Village, it is a must to visit wether you are camping or not. It has the all the outdoors vibes: the PCT hikers coming out from the trail, getting resupplys, a shower and a place to pinch the tent...a nice supply store, and restaurant (i can't review, as I haven't tried it)- the sky is s clear, any place is a great place for shooting starts- go for a dive to the Crater Lake, deep blue waters, that you can also fish and keep (yes, you read correctly, keep! the lake is over populated!!)- Hike up the Watchman Hut for the best sunset you'll ever see, the sun deeping into the California mountain range, and on the other side the Crater Lake turning into pink colors... - Visit some of many falls, options depend on the level of trail you'd like to do. definely would love to come back to Crater Lake! limitless.","August 18, 2015","Many state parks in Oregon, only one National Park! no wonder.",14,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",5

While you take this trip, you will see where solid rock was sheered away by volcanic forces. Tearing a piece of paper in half is obviously nothing to consider, in terms of the strength or energy needed. What force would be necessary to tear (like tearing paper) solid rock 1000 feet thick? Now, draw a circle whose diameter is just about six miles across. What distance would that perimeter be? That's what happened at Crater Lake 7700 years ago.

Watch out for rocks, uneven steps, and it does get windy up at the rim. Read their website, there are so many great facts and tours! There is limited wheelchair access. $15 per car to access the park. There are restrooms at Rim Village, Mazama Village and the Steel Visitor Center.

Crater Lake National Park,"We arrived on a very hot summer day and were eventually run off by thunderstorms. The ride from Bend got us there about noon. As we waited for other family members to catch up, we headed down the caldera to the park office where we hiked the Lady of the Woods trail. This is short but has some elevation ad featured the story behind the park formation. We shopped the gift shop before going back up to he Rim Village. It started pouring rain; so hard that we could not see the lake. As the weather started to clear, the lake reappeared in half-view as the storm marched across the 9000 ft high scenery. We picnicked in our cars and because other storms were tracking toward us, left the park soon after. However, our sons and some of our family (ages 8 thru 3) stayed and hiked to the lake shore when the weather cleared. they jumped into the frigid waters and splashed around close to shore. Don't try doing this from the top of the caldera as it will be fatal!Gorgeous sites but not for those with vertigo or motion sickness. The roads are very twisty with few guard rails.

Crater Lake National Park,"This beautiful blue lake is the remnants left over after a volcano (Mount Mazama) erupted and collapsed several hundred years ago. The resulting caldera filled with water known as Crater Lake. There is an island (Wizards Island) in the lake. Boat tours can take visitors over to the island. The deepest part of the lake is nearly 2,000 feet.Around 16 hiking trails are around the lake itself, ranging from easy to strenuous. Each will give visitors a different view of the lake. Gift shops and a restaurant are at the main entrance. This national park is very crowded. Parking spaces are a premium. I would advise getting here early and spending a good part of the day exploring this area.There is a video playing that gives some of the history of the formation of the lake. Though it is a great place for science buffs and adults, most younger children would not want to spend the entire day here.One suggestion.....if you are going to visit several national parks in one year, get a park pass. They cost $80 (as of 2015) but will be cheaper in the long run as most national parks charge $30 per car to enter. There is a discount for senior citizens on getting a very cheap pass, so inquire about that if you are a senior adult.","August 16, 2015",Beautiful place,360,"Pataskala, Ohio",5

Crater Lake National Park,"We returned to stay in the lovely Lodge this time. As others have exclaimed, Crater Lake is perhaps the bluest lake in the world...its waters are considered the world's clearest, to be sure! Make sure to reserve a spot on the Volcano Boat so you can see the lovely waters close-up! The Cleetwood Trail is a bit strenuous going down and up, so allocate sufficient time (and don't be in a wheel chair!). Wizard Rock, Phantom Ship (or Island), Pumice Castle, all await your viewing and photography. Bring your swim suit for a quick dip while you wait for the boat...the waters are cold, but taste and feel so good you don't want to get out! The Rim Drive is spectacular and Vidae Falls, the Pinnacles and other attractions are close by. Accent your visit by staying in the magnificent Crater Lake Lodge and visit Rim Village and the other gift shops. Wow! We made a special trip just to stay in the Lodge and were entirely satisfied. What a jewel! Ensure you reserve as much as a year out. (and for dinner reservations, too). We loved hiking parts of the Rim Trail, especially at sunset. The views are stunning! Too many accolades to include here... just a phenomenal gem of our National Park System!","August 13, 2015","Blue, Blue, Stunningly Blue!",643,washington state,5
Crater Lake National Park,"I cannot even begin to explain how amazing it is to finally see Crater Lake in person, for the very first time. This has been on my bucket list for the longest time. But logistics, schedules, and weather have been key issues as to why we've never been successful to do so, 'til now.Just a quick background in case you are not familiar with Crater Lake. The lake is one of Oregon's ""Seven Wonders."" It is the deepest and biggest craters in all of North America and is one of the biggest sources of fresh water in the world. It is known for its majestic views and bluer than blue waters. Every year, people from around the world go to Oregon to see the lake -- but it remains to be one of the most underrated beauties on the planet.With this trip being such a much anticipated one, we wanted it to be special and we wanted to feel like we had the views all to ourselves. To achieve this, we decided that the best time for us to visit would be during sunrise. And since we also did not have enough time in our hands and we also did not have any hiking gear, we figured that the best view by car would be at the Crater Lake Lodge. So knowing that sunrise was at 5:55AM, we drove to Crater Lake at around 3:30AM from Jacksonville.The suspense was crazy. It was dark, we were all alone on the road, and we did not have any mobile phone coverage. We were pretty much grappling in the dark. But when we finally made it to Crater Lake Lodge just in time for sunrise, it was all worth it. The lake was just absolutely peaceful and majestic. It actually looks like it's not even real. True enough we were able to enjoy the views all to ourselves, just the way we wanted it to be. After sunrise, we decided to have breakfast at the lodge. I ordered the frittata and it was just amazing! We were planning on waiting for the sun to fully come up, but unfortunately after having checked the weather forecast, it was going to be cloudy the entire morning so we didn't see the iconic deep blue colours of lake. But nonetheless we were happy and we felt quite successful after such a dramatic journey.This will definitely be a first of many other future visits to see the lake. We realised that the best way to fully enjoy it would be to stay at the Crater Lake Lodge (we did plan on doing this, but it was just fully booked despite trying to reserve as early as 5 months in advanced -- note to self, must reserve at least a year ahead!). The reason why we think that staying at the lodge would be wise is because we also want to see the lake during sunset. Waiting for sunset would mean the park would already be closed and the only people that would have access to a sunset view would be the guests of the lodge. And even if there were other viewpoints outside of the park that can give a sunset view, we would never risk driving in the dark again. Also, the lodge has all kinds of programs and tours exclusive to the guests, including a night tour and some campfire activities that kids are sure to enjoy. So if that is something you think you would also like, I definitely would recommend for you to stay there too! ","August 13, 2015",Enchanting Crater Lake,120,"Portland, Oregon",5
Crater Lake National Park,Visitors are always impressed by this deep blue lake created in the caldera of an ancient volcano.Generally the area is closed until late spring due to huge amounts of snowfall but this year that was not the case.Visit the Crater Lake Lodge and view the exhibit right off the lobby.

Crater Lake National Park,A beautiful lake in the crater of a volcano what isn't to oooo and aww about. There is only one trail down to the lake. It took us 20 minutes to get down and more like 45 to get up. The lake is full of trout and salmon and some people actually hike down to fish and swim. The boat tour of the lake is nice and relaxing - worth the price for the history told by the Ranger guide while you view rock creations and other parts of the lake you can't see from just looking at it from the top. Lots of Ranger led hikes for adults and kids. A great place for the entire family. The food at the Lodge was great too.,"August 12, 2015",The Bluest Lake I Have Ever Seen,40,"Bothell, Washington",5

It costs $40 per person but it is worth it. You can buy the tickets at the visitor center but also (when seats left) at the booth down at the boat jetty.

I would definitely recommend reserving a spot on the outer edge of the camp instead of in the middle. They have running water, bathrooms and hot showers (you do have to pay for them.) We took a long drive around the whole lake and also took the boat tour around the lake including a stop on Wizard Island. This was absolutely one of the best parts of the trip.

We stayed onsite at the Mazama Village Cabins the night before exploring the park, and had to get underway to Portland before the morning was over. For us, a morning was adequate to drive around most of Rim Drive, but if you want to do a hike or take the boat to Wizard Island, give yourself another night's stay. If you do only have a morning like we did, many of the photo ops are visible from the built-in stops as you wend your way around the rim by car.

Stopped at all the overlooks and each had a unique view of the crater and lake. take the tram around the rim with a guide and you get much more information about the crater and the way it was formed. Be sure to take a hike with a ranger. Great programs available. Sun Notch hike is handicapped friendly but still difficult without some assistance. Be prepared if you want to take the boat on the lake. It is 1.1 miles down and 1.1 miles up. Very strenuous!!! Make reservations well in advance. Stayed at nearby Prospect Inn in Prospect. They were wonderful. Kudos to them because they fed the firefighters fighting the forest fire.,"August 11, 2015",Unbelievable color blue in lake,49,"Charleston, South Carolina",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Unfortunately when we visited Crater Lake, and stayed overnight in the Lodge, there was a forest fire raging nearby. We were able to get a couple photos of the lake, then the smoke moved in and we all but lost Wizard Island. No one to blame, but Mother Nature.Some of the wait staff seemed overly tired. There's just something annoying about an employee yawning, in your face, when you are asking them a question. Another one had a cranky, unfriendly face and when I asked if she was okay, she said she was going on vacation the next day. I guess what I should have said was, ""sorry 'bout that missy, but we're on vacation NOW""! I thought she could have tried, just a smidge, to be a bit more friendly. Other than that, we had a wonderful time and everyone else was smiley and happy. My buffalo meatloaf was delicious and so was breakfast.

Any photo I've seen doesn't do it justice. The blue water is breathtaking. I'm a little nervous around heights, but once I settled myself, I really enjoyed the trail. An amazing lookout near the Lodge gave a good description of how it was formed and a little back history of its development. It's truly a sight to see.

Crater Lake National Park,"This was my fourth trip to Crater Lake in the past 30 years, and even with the heavy smoke from the nearby fires, it was still as breathtakingly beautiful as ever. But Crater Lake, like many other tourist attractions in Oregon is not very accommodating to handicapped visitors. This was the first time I had visited the park since becoming partially disabled, requiring the use of cane and, at times, wheelchair. By the time we were half way around the lake, I came to accept that I would have to stay in the car and look at the views from that position while my companions were able to fully appreciate the view. Some, with stone barriers, were large enough to provide a seat, sitting sideways and looking back. Others had nothing at all to aid a patron that was unsteady on her feet. All trails, boat attractions, short hikes, etc., were off limits, even if I'd used the wheelchair. We didn't go to Rim village, this time, so I can't speak for it, but we did stop at the gift shop in Mazama village, but they were the least accommodating of all. After finding a handicap parking space, a good distance from the marked gift shop, we learned that we were looking at the shop back with no entrance, and that to get to the entrance it was necessary to walk several hundred feet along a concrete walkway to get to the entrance. I was unable to walk that far, so I waited in the car. When my companions returned, they told me that even with a wheelchair, I might not have been able to enter the gift shop. I've visited state and national parks where management has made an effort to bring the nature experience to the handicapped as well as those of sound body. Unfortunately, Crater Lake isn't one of them.","August 11, 2015",Not Too Accomodating for the Disabled,1,"Hawthorne, California",2
Crater Lake National Park,"The most amazing place I have ever been to.The bluest blue water of the lake is so clear (and it tastes good too). The walk down to Cleetwood Cove is not one for anyone with walking up or down hill but can be taken at a slower place with places to stop along the way. Also the trail although is plenty wide enough, there is no railing so if you have issues with heights be aware,but...IT IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO WORTH IT!!!!! We did a tour of the lake with a 3hr stop on Wizard Island. Swimming can be done at the bottom of the trail or on the island. It is cold...early Aug it was 58f...so not for the faint hearted but an experience we will ever forget!!!

Crater Lake National Park,"We spent several hours here in July. We first stopped at the Rim Village where we had excellent views of Wizard Island and the deep blue color of the lake. We then drove around the lake clockwise. We stopped at several overlooks - Watchman, Cloudcap, Phantom Ship and Vidae Falls. The views from these areas are amazing. On a clear day with no wind the reflections on the water are great. We also drive down a side road to the Pinnacles Overlook - well worth a stop. We waited for the sun to set and got some great shots from the Phantom Ship Overlook.

We were lucky and the roads were open in June all the way around the crater tho the lookout was still closed. We went to each and every tourist stop and were awe by the beauty of this place.We hiked down into the crater 700' down. Whew, it was lots of switchbacks. The boats were not operating yet, but it would have been wonderful to do the boat cruise and learn more about the history and geology.Stayed at the Mazama Village Campground which was nice but the showers/toilets were not available in our section. The staff at the lodge could use some customer service training as they weren't as helpful as they should have been. The showers in the main lodge don't open til late so it was a challenge getting on the road early for us. Showers at the lodge cost about $2.50 for 5 minutes.

In the winter the snow can get deep but the roads are well maintained (chains may be needed). In the spring it's cold but with the receding snow and the blue water can make anyone fall in love. Summer time is still pretty chilly up there so take your coat. The view from the rim is awesome, weather you are looking at the lake or over the valleys around the lake. I've hiked most of the trails around the lake and hope to hike them again. The gift shop and hotel are world class and the cost isn't to bad. I really like mid fall up there.

Crater Lake National Park,"We drove around the rim, took the 2-hour boat tour of the lake, and also took a boat to Wizard Island, where we hiked up to the summit. Stopped at all the main lookout points on the Rim drive, and also took a detour to see The Pinnacles. Took a lot of pictures, but photos don't do justice...this place is absolutely stunning! The single vehicle entrance fee is $15 for a 7-day pass.When we arrived in Medford, it was really smoky due to forest fires, which made me doubt that we'd be able to see much of Crater Lake! On our way to Prospect, where we were staying, it got really bad and at one point we were driving through this apocalyptic thick orange haze. However, we got really lucky, with clear views the next two mornings. We did notice that it started getting hazy in the afternoons though...I'm rating the park itself as ""Excellent"", however, I do have a complaint about the confusing/unclear road signs going to Crater Lake. A few other people we talked to also agreed with us. From Prospect, we wanted to head to the North entrance. Driving along Hwy 62, we reached a fork with one sign indicating a right turn to ""Crater Lake"". Just a little ahead, there was another sign which said ""Crater Lake National Park North Entrance"". So we turned right, thinking that was the North entrance. We soon passed a sign saying that it was the West entrance, and we ended up having to drive the West rim north to get to our destination, Cleetwood Cove Trail. We eventually realized that the ""North Entrance"" sign that we had seen was to indicate to drivers to continue driving straight (and not turn right) to get to the North entrance. But there was no arrow on the sign! We ended up wasting a lot of time. Fortunately, we had decided to take this drive the night before our boat tour at 8:30 in the morning, just to familiarize ourselves with the route. If not, we most certainly would've missed the boat.","August 5, 2015",Breathtaking scenery!,52,Canada,5

The Rim Drive is so amazing (and sometimes nail-biting for those of us not comfortable with heights), and there are so many great places to stop and view the lake or take a hike on a trail. We entered from the North Entrance and took the West Rim Drive We especially liked the Discovery Point Trail, Rim Visitor Center, the park video at Park Headquarters, and Pinnacles Trail. I would have liked to hike some of the longer trails with more elevation, but the 13 y/o daughter wasn't up for that.

Previously, we have had car troubles, it was closed due to snow (in June), or our schedule just didn't work out. This time, it was a destination for our August trip, but, alas, smoke from the summer wildfires made the experience less than perfect. No fault of the Park Service, though. The road was in excellent condition, well place signage, what we did see was just bait for me to come back again and do some hiking and further exploring. There is much to see here (on a clear day). As it was, We were barely able to see the lake on account of the smoke from the ridge above.

You have to plan ahead to really have the best shot to do this. Check out other reviews to see why.

Crater Lake National Park,"If you are a lover of nature and have not made the trip to this secluded, spectacular natural wonder, you really must go. Crater Lake is breathtakingly beautiful at any time of the year. It offers the best of the classic National Park experience - an amazing historic lodge built to overlook the wordless beauty of a unique visual, ecological, biological and cultural landmark.

Crater Lake National Park,"Start with a beautiful drive to the park. I would suggest taking the rim drive around the lake to see waterfalls and different viewpoints. Don't miss the short one-way drive to The Pinnacles. Interesting formations. Check out the lodge and restaurant, or take a picnic lunch and enjoy the scenery. On the way back south stop and check out the natural bridge area. It's incredible. We stopped at Beckies for breakfast and on the way back, got icream just a few yards away from Beckies. They are in the Union Creek day use area. You won't believe the different hues of blue in this lake!","July 29, 2015",Amazing,38,"Kansas City, Missouri",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is easily one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. A volcano that exploded thousands of years ago, the hollow top has now filled with water and is crowned by the small island in the middle, which is actually the volcano building again to its next explosion in another few (or many) thousand years. I felt small and awed, seeing this.","July 29, 2015","Out of the way, but SO worth it",21,"Stuttgart, Germany",5
Crater Lake National Park,"I've had Crater Lake on my radar for a few years. Recently I was able to zoom in. The approach to Crater Lake is a rather unassuming drive, just another small back road. BUT -- when you reach the summit and get your first glimpse -- a WOW moment occurs. I won't try to describe the beauty nor the color as many have tried. What I'd point out is the accessibility of views! Drive rim drive, take the trolley, or BOTH. This park is off the beaten path, but well attended, however not like many of the biggies. The weather is cooler (as the elevation at the rim is ~ 7000'). From right at the village multiple picture angles are achieveable from the walkway. Getting down to the lake is an effort, but the return up is very strenuous (so I'm told). We opted to view from the top. If you go, including driving the rim -- 4 or 5 hours should be enough, but your definition of beauty will change for life.","July 29, 2015",Awe Inspiring,61,"Lebanon, Kentucky",5
Crater Lake National Park,We were staying at an RV park in Klamath Falls and had an extra day. So we were looking for something to see.Crater Lake was a good hour and 1/2 away so we debated about going. Boy are we glad we did. Our visit turned into over 3 hours.What an amazing site. It is just phenomenal. Every pull out for stopping provides a little different view. Well worth the trip!The 22 minute video at the visitors center on the creation of the lake is a must see. It ranks as one of the top parks we have been in.,"July 28, 2015",Crater Lake is amazing!,18,"Surprise, Arizona",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is one of those natural wonders that is just hard to describe! It is so blue! It was a beautiful Tuesday when we were there. Lots of people, but not crowded since it was midweek. We only had about 4 hours to spend so we took the drive around the rim first. The road was under construction in places on the east side, but still passable. We had a wonderful meal at Mazama Village and spent time in the gift shops at both Mazama & Rim Villages. Very nice with reasonable prices. Food services at Rim Village were very limited. We did not go to the hotel to see if there was public dining there if you were not a guest, but all that was available in the gift shop area was a small deli with about 6 small tables. We were glad we had chosen to eat at Mazama Village near the campground.","July 27, 2015",Beautiful and Blue!,39,"Albany, Oregon",4
Crater Lake National Park,"This is just an awesome place! The lake is beautiful and we could have spent a long time here, but had only some hours.

Crater Lake National Park,"There’s a reason it’s unbelievably blue, and you can learn about it here. Naturally you’ll take the rim drive. But also consider taking the narrated boat tour of the lake as you’ll see things you can’t see from above the lake like the waterfalls. It’s a steep, one mile walk down to the lake, but my 73 year old husband and I did it. We just used the benches to rest on the way back up. And don’t think the incredible lake is all there is. Take some ranger guided hikes and listen to some interesting patio chats give by rangers daily in the summer. Perhaps take the hike to Plaikni falls, or stroll the trail of the pinnicles. We spent a week here at the park’s campground and there was something different to do every day.","July 26, 2015",You Won't Believe How Blue It Is!,282,"San Diego, California",5
Crater Lake National Park,"This has to be a highlight of any road trip in this part of the USA. The scenery and the colours are outstanding. The rim road is narrow in places, with no guardrail and a long drop. If you don't like heights, it can be a little unnerving, but it's well worth the effort. There's a good cafe, and a hotel should you wish to stay longer.

Crater Lake National Park,Crater lake is everything that you read and see in pictures with double the wow factor when you see it for real. Sunset at the place is breath taking and view of the lake from east or west rim is equally wonderful. However mosquitos at the east rim played spoiler to the party so take some repellent before you go. If you are lucky you will see some deers on your way. Couldn't do the trip down to the lake but thats the reason to visit the place again.,"July 26, 2015",Magnificent natural beauty,7,,5
Crater Lake National Park,"You got to see this phenomenon! It is breathtakingly beautiful. Take a ride with the trolley bus around the rim of the crater.

Crater Lake National Park, Overall crater Lake is extremely beautiful. It is definitely worth a visit and worth spending at least a couple days here. Unfortunately the agencies working within the park don't work well together. National Park Rangers have inconsistent facts about crater Lake depending on which tour you go on. The trolley service can be very confusing. Please see our other review on the crater Lake trolley. The hikes around crater Lake are great. The visitors Guide you receive upon entering the park is extremely helpful and accurate when it comes to describing the hiking trails. The water in crater Lake is the most beautiful blue you have ever seen in a natural body of water. ,"July 25, 2015",Beautiful national park,19,"La Center, Washington",4

You can drive, bike, hike, etc all around the rim and on multiple trails to see the breathtaking views. It was 10-15° cooler with some snow still on the ground in early June when we visited. There are easy to moderate to strenuous hikes, so people of all ages and abilities can enjoy it -- or you can just drive to each of the view points.

Crater Lake National Park,"We made a long drive to see Crater Lake and were not disappointed. What an absolutely beautiful, natural phenomena. Because we were short on time we did our research before we went and made a decision to focus on the top 7 stops that are recommended in the Natl. Park literature. We drove around the entire lake but made these selective stops in order to manage our time. It was awesome. Do be aware that this park is at a pretty high altitude so allow yourself the ability to get acclimated. If you have a chance to see this natural beauty, make sure you don't miss it.","July 24, 2015",Absolutely Breathtaking,184,"Lake Jackson, Texas",5
Crater Lake National Park,"I somewhat laugh at this as being the #1 thing to do in Crater Lake. It IS THE thing to do when you come here. After all, there is one reason you drive to this national park and it is to see the natural wonder that is Crater Lake and the one of its kind purity of its blue water. We came down from the Seattle area to start a summer road trip and chose Crater Lake as our first stop, somewhat unsurprising for its proximity to where we live.Crater Lake is one of those places where you have a before and after experience. No matter how many pictures you see or what people tell you, the first time you stop to witness the lake, you are awestruck. The sheer brilliance of the water's color and the beauty of his majestic creation of nature brings a sense of awe along with pure amazement. I loved the full day we spent here hiking Cleetwood trail and climbing to the top of Mt. Scott for panoramic views of Crater Lake. The only bummer was that the boats were not yet running so we couldn't make it over to Wizard Island. I've heard that it is a magical place in the winter and will certainly make the journey here again to experience this miraculous place.","July 24, 2015",Stunning Natural Beauty,50,"Bellevue, Washington",5

Crater Lake National Park,"The scenery is the best you will find anywhere in the world. We drove around the lake entering in the North and taking the East rim road. The views are just magnificent. The crystal blue water is hard to believe. The Lodge is always busy. We arrived at about 1.30 pm and could not get in the restaurant, busy busy busy. There were hundreds of cars there and parking is difficult to find but with patience you will eventually get a place. To stay at the Lodge you need to book a year ahead. We just went for a day trip[ and stayed in Bend. It was a quite long day but worth it. This is my third visit and it still amazes me with its beauty.","July 23, 2015",Wonderland,23,"Silverton, Oregon",5

Crater Lake National Park,"This beautiful National Park, one of our favorites of the 29 we have visited so far, can be quite thoroughly seen in a day or so during July, August or September with a little planning; the average annual snowfall of 44ft (13.4m) often limits access during the rest of the year. We would recommend a visit of about a day to visit without a boat tour of the lake itself and a day and a half if one does take a boat tour.While it is possible to drive to Rim Village, stop by the Visitor Center to learn a bit about the park and take is some beautiful views of Crater Lake and Wizard Island, for a one day visit, one should take the time to drive the 33 mile (53k) Rim Drive around the lake to truly experience all that Crater Lake has to offer. Generally, it is recommended to take the drive in a clockwise direction, and while this seems to make sense as this puts the highest concentration of viewpoints near the beginning of the drive and, in theory, it is easier to get in and out of the pullouts that will be mostly on the right hand side. However, we found we were generally stuck in crowds, made worse by the inevitable road construction along the rim during the very short season, while driving the Rim Drive in the counterclockwise direction, we had the road and viewpoints virtually to ourselves most of the way, making getting in and out of the pullouts to our left mostly a non-issue. An added benefit was that it put the sun to our back rather than in our face, making the views and color better, especially in the morning before haze and clouds build in the afternoon.So, for a one day visit, I would recommend stopping by the camper store at Mazama Village to pick-up picnic supplies followed by a stop at the Steele Visitor Center adjacent to Park Headquarters to get information and orient oneself to the park. From here, the East Rim Drive, taking one in the counterclockwise direction, departs from the main park road. A half mile (0.8k) on East Rim Drive brings one to the excellent and easy Castle Crest Wildflower Trail. From here, enjoy the tranquil drive, stopping at the overlooks of interest and enjoy your picnic lunch. Most will complete the loop around the lake on Rim Drive to arrive at Rim Village mid to late afternoon, just as the crowds start to dissipate, to complete your day. If you arrived the evening before and like hiking, get an early start and hike the wonderful 1.7 mile (2.7k) Annie Creek Canyon loop trail before heading up to the rim.If you have more time and you are prepared for the strenuous 1.1 mile (1.8k) long, 700 foot (213m) climb back up to the rim, at an average elevation of about 6500 feet (1980m), a Volcano Boat tour of the lake is an excellent way to spend another half day at Crater Lake. While same day and next day tickets are available 24 hours in advance from kiosks in the Crater Lake Lodge and the Annie Creek Gift Shop, tickets are limited, so to avoid disappointment, reserve tickets well in advance of your visit (search “volcano boat cruises - crater lake lodges”). For an additional half day visit, the most practical boat tour option is the two hour standard lake tour as the whole adventure will take much longer than two hours as one needs to drive 10.7 miles (17.2k) from Rim Village to the Cleatwood Cove trailhead, find a parking spot, check-in at the rim level, hike down the 1.1 mile (1.8k) trail to the boat dock, check-in again, take the two hour tour and then climb back out; however, it was well worth every minute and every bead a sweat generated from the climb back out.If you are unfortunate enough to have less than one full day to visit this beautiful park, it can still be enjoyed by heading directly to Rim Village and seeing the sights from along the rim there, visiting the main visitor center there followed by a stop at the nearby Discovery Point overlook which probably provides the most picturesque view of the lake and cinder cone of Wizard Island.","July 22, 2015",How to See this Beautiful Park in a Day or So,3757,"Avon, Ohio",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Of course, the lake is deep, blue, and gorgeous, but until you see it, you really can't imagine or appreciate it. So beautiful. After getting a map at the ranger/fee station, we drove clockwise around the lake.Since we had just one day, we did not go to Wizard Island, as hiking and enjoying that exercise and scenery were out priorities. So, we recommend Watchman Trail (the steepest, but it's just one mile, and the views are SO worth it), Discover Pt Trail (1 hour total), the Fumarole Trail (get closer to these bizarre outgrowths than what the overlook/parking lot shows you), and the long Mt. Scott Trail. All of these give you beautiful views of the lake, and each one showcases a different color, vantage point, or interesting spectacle such as ""Phantom Ship.""We picniced, but we found it interesting that both picnic areas we found had minimal tables: 1 at one and 2 at another.

Beautiful from every angle.","July 13, 2015",A gem of a National Park,111,"Lakeside, California",5
Crater Lake National Park,"On a recent trip to Bend, Oregon we had heard of Crater Lake from other travelers and decided to visit. Driving to the park from Bend is very easy but there is almost nothing in the way of restaurants or gas stations so gas up before you go. There was at least one rest stop on the highway. It took us about 2 1/2 to three hours to drive to the south entrance which is where the visitor center is located. On the return trip, we left out of the north entrance which seemed like a faster trip for us. Next time I go, I will enter from the north.I was disappointed in the visitor center. It was quite small with not a lot to offer and I had driven longer to get there. My disappointment was soon overcome by the incredible view of Crater Lake. That was only surpassed by the view near the wizard's hat where I think my heart stopped beating for a moment.  If you are in the area, you must stop at this national park. There is a fee to get in. $15 for most but if someone is over 65 years and shows an ID and is an American citizen than the cost is $10 lifetime. There is a small area that sells food and drinks, souvenir shop, etc. I like that there were free refills on the drinks.We did not drive around the entire lake, as we did not have enough time. You can hike down to the lake, about a one mile hike, but then you have to climb up, too. There is a boat ride and trolley ride but we did not partake in either. I was traveling with two octogenarians so hiking was really out of the question. If I ever get a chance to go here again, I would like to touch the surface of the lake and ride the boat.","July 13, 2015",You Must See This!,98,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",5
Crater Lake National Park,We were staying in Grants Pass and wanted to visit Crater Lake. It was a pleasant drive and so worth it. The lake is amazing. We did not drive around the rim as we had waited about 1.5 hours for the fog to lift and didn't have enough time. We stopped at two spots to view the lake and enjoy the beauty. ,"July 13, 2015",Crater Lake,4,California,5

Crater Lake National Park,"Never had the opportunity to hike down to the lake itself and that may have made the difference in thinking this Cater was more than just a drive-thru attraction. There is a drive all the way around the lake with some really neat lookouts throughout. The crowds and traffic move regularly except for some popular areas (like the boat dock). Only one day is needed to view this place. After stopping at just about every lookout I have pictures of the lake in varying angles (yes, the same lake over and over again).You can get food at the lodge if you don't mind giving up your paycheck for the month.","July 12, 2015",That's one big lake,12,Illinois,3
Crater Lake National Park,"You have to want to see it, because it is quite a drive from anywhere. Even during our visit in July it was quite cool, and the rain and snow convinced even the diehard hikers in our group not to hike down to the lake. The ride around the rim by trolley costs $25 per person, so our group just drove. The views are magnificent, even without sunshine.

It is absolutely one of the most beautiful lakes I have ever seen. My only complaint is that the NPS does not have signs identifying the turnouts. We had a map and had marked where we wanted to stop, but couldn't tell where we were. Why bother to name something, say, Discovery Point or Cloudcap, when there is no sign or plaque identifying it as such?

Crater Lake National Park,I took my youth group of 34 highschool and college aged and we had an over the top blast! We found the cliff jumping and don't be fooled because there are multiple spots to jump from. There is the typical one on the main path but if you're really adventurous there is a 40ft jump right across the way. The boys especially were loving it! The only thing to watch out for is there are quite a few foreigners who have never swimmer before jumping in. Most of them wear life jackets but still.. It wasn't always enough. We had a to save a few. Also! The water wasn't too cold! It felt nice and all of us were just in board shorts and rash guards! Wahoo! I highly recommend this place! It's beautiful and so fun!

Crater Lake National Park,"On this trip we had my Mom with us who has trouble walking so we decided to take the drive around the rim of the lake and take in the sights from there. Rim Drive is about 33 miles around with lots of pullouts offering amazing views of the parks volcanic scenery including Wizard Island - 'the volcano within a volcano' that you can take a boat tour to, Phantom Ship - a smaller lava island and the oldest exposed rock within the caldera, Pumice Castle - a layer of orange pumice eroded into the shape of a medieval castle (note this is an unmarked viewpint just west of the Cloudcap viewpoint, Vidae Falls - parking was tricky as it was just a small pullout. The falls itself was a lot smaller than I thought and high up on the cliff, Discovery Point, Watchman Overlook - the best view of Wizard Island but unmarked but about 4 miles west of Rim Village, Pinnacles Overlook - a 6 mile detour off Rim Drive so we skipped it, and Cloudcap Overlook - a short 1 mile detour from Rim Drive but it is the highest paved road in Oregon, just so you know! With a stop at most every overlook it took us easily 3 hours so I took take photos from each one around the lake. Bathroom facilities can be found at Rim Village and most trailheads. Entry fee is $15/car and well worth it. The ranger will give you a few maps and informational material to enhance your rim experience. Next time we visit we will try to stay at the Lodge overlooking the lake at Rim Village!","July 8, 2015",Positively worth the trip!,85,"Vancouver, Washington",5

Crater Lake National Park,"We drove from Bend to the Crater Lake National Park which took about two hours. The lake view was breathtaking. I've never seen such beautiful blue water. We drove around the lake clockwise which made each view point stop easy. Also, that help kept us away from driving next to occasional cliff side of the road (right side of road for clockwise drive is a small upward slope or hills). Highly recommend taking the Cleetwood Cove Trail down to the water (only water aces). It was a steep trail but manageable. There were people diving or swimming down there. We spent total of 4.5 hours in the park without any rush.","July 8, 2015",Just Beautiful,32,"Houston, Texas",5

It's always a beautiful, magical place but when covered in snow, it's amazing...it made me cry. Don't expect much to be open tho, the lodge is closed but the gift shop and restrooms are open.

We are actually staying in Sunriver for a few weeks, so we did the two hour drive down. We arrived at the park at approximately 9:30 am. At that time there was no ranger at the North Entrance station, but they did have a self pay station and a box where you could pick up the park map and the park news. We paid and continued the drive in.We chose to do the east to west route. What a beautiful drive. There are approximately 25 pull outs to stop, look, and take some pictures. We had our dog with us and they are only allowed on a few trails so we did not do any hiking. Next time, we will come dogless.We stopped at the visitor center, which ended up being about half way from where we entered, got out and walked around a bit. Parking is very limited and they are working on something that has quite a few of the parking spaces dug up. We went into the lodge to check it out, very beautiful, but small. Really liked that the bark was still on the logs on the interior of the lodge. We then drove up into a little picnic area and had our lunch before continuing on.It ended up being about a 3-4 hour drive around with all the stops.Definitely a must see, the lake is gorgeous, and we loved the greenery that surrounds the lake.","July 4, 2015",Gorgeous,114,"Arlington, Washington",5

Crater Lake National Park,"It's over 7000 ft above sea level so take it easy if altitude gets you. It did me; however, after a little time of adjustment, I forgot all about it. Take your time and take in the scenery which is why you're there to begin with. Take the time to watch the short 20 minute video at the rangers station as it tells you all about how the lake came about. It's truly amazing. No lake rides/tours until towards the end of June. Be sure to gas up before you leave the park.

I really enjoyed visiting the lake. The reflection in the water was beautiful. I also enjoyed the unique birds flying around. I like that I can take my dog on the paved areas and take pictures with him there too. There was ample parking and it was a Saturday. I would highly recommend you visit this national park on your way to and from other destinations in Oregon Washington or California.,"June 22, 2015",So awesome! ,49,,5
Crater Lake National Park,"There may be no more beautiful lake in all the world. Easy to get to, very good roads in the summer. Walk from the parking lot to the edge and then just pick you jaw off of the ground. The lake is a shade of blue that somehow nature created where mankind just could not match. All of the reading and photos you can find will not prepare you for the reality. We drove around the road along the rim and stopped about 15 different places to get a new perspective, all of them amazing. Take a couple of days and experience the beauty the nature offers at Crater Lake. Never to be forgotten.","June 22, 2015",Simple and Stunning,39,Seattle,5

Crater Lake National Park,"Though it is off the interstate beaten path, Crater Lake is well worth the effort! Go in mid-June before the crush of other nature lovers and the persistent buzz of mosquitoes if you can, but GO! The intense sapphire blue is unbelievably stunning! The rim road drive offers many scenic viewpoints though not many picnic areas. If you want to see the view from below the rim take the boat trip on the lake-a 1.1 mile hike each way starting late June. Be sure to catch a Ranger' s talk or read the information signs for the fascinating origin of the lake and the history of the park. Take time to walk the Pinnacles trail and explore beyond the Visitors Center. If you can snag a rocking chair, enjoy the terrace at the Lodge with a snack or beverage and take in one of the most beautiful sights in the world. The only drawback to the park besides the scenic but winding path to get there is the limited number of rooms and campsites near the park. I have only stayed in Klamath Falls about an hour south of the park which really wasn't a problem.","June 19, 2015",A Blue You Won't Believe!,31,Seattle,5

We entered the park at the north entrance and drove along the west rim, stopping at viewpoints on the way.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake averages 44 feet of snow every year. The last 2 or 3 years have been draught years. We should have seen a lot of snow and some hikes should be closes, but due to the drought we had access to the whole park.There is a circular rim drive around the lake. There are plenty of pull offs to stop and take pictures. Be prepared to have your socks wow'ed off. Each stop is a different gorgeous view.If you are an early starter take the East rim drive in the morning to have the sun over your shoulder. Hikes were available to any level. We limit ourselves to moderate to easy hikes. The only legal access to the water is a steep hike down and strenuous climb back. We did not take it. The boat tour around Crater Lake does not start running until late June due to the weather. We would not have taken it due to the difficult trail to the boat. There is also a guided trolley tour around the rim for $22 per person. We chose to drive ourselves. The park at this time of the year was not crowded and we had no trouble driving around and finding parking. This may not be true in July and August. The park is open year round, but due to snow many roads and hiking trails are unavailable October to June. ","June 15, 2015",Crater Lake is Great!,135,"Reading, Pennsylvania",5

Diamond Lake's beautiful but we didn't see Crater Lake from there. If we had a re-do, we would not go to Diamond Lake, and spend more time at Crater Lake.

There was an eery shroud of fog that would intermittently cover the lake and then clear out. Seeing the deep blue hue of the water against the blinding white snow made for such a memorable experience. To see Wizard Island seemingly float in solitude and then disappear in the fog was just awesome. We had a good time viewing the lake, hiking in the snow a little and had a great snowball fight. We had the place to ourselves in the middle of March. I can't wait to go back when everything is a bit more accessible in the warmer months.

It isn't just the size of the place, or the staggering beauty, it's actually quite difficult to pin it all down to one thing because wherever you look you are just struck down with the sheer majesty of it all. The way the filaments of ice look as though they are reflections of sirus clouds, the quietly cracking lake, the majestic peaks of the rim. And I beg you to climb the rim.

This year, because of the warm winter, the rim drive opened in May, although only the western drive is open.Be prepared to share the park with a huge crowd. There is a road around the lake, but everyone is on it. There are only a few parking areas.If you come after late June, you can hike down to the lake, and take a boat cruise. If you are fit (it's a steep climb out), it's definitely a worthwhile thing to do.There aren't many places to eat here, so pack a picnic.","June 9, 2015",One of my favorite places,283,"Sammamish, Washington",5

We went on one small hike as one downside of coming in June is that a lot of the trails still had snow on them. Also, the trolley wasn't running yet or the boat tours. They must start later into the summer/tourist season. We still enjoyed the views of the lake and reading about its history. We were going to stop in the smaller cafe in the gift shop and get our son a sandwich, but it was a little pricey ($3.25 for a cookie, 1.95 for a small milk, and $5 for a PB&J).","June 6, 2015",June visit,85,Dickinson,5

But when I got to the lake, I found the clouds had mostly cleared over the lake, the sun was shining, and the lake was that spectacular deep clear blue that you only seem to find at this lake. I was surprised there was still so much snow at the lake, and the east side of the lake rim drive was still closed, but it only added to its beauty, in my opinion. Those of us who had made the drive despite the weather, drove from rim view to rim view, smiling and grinning at each other, and at the unexpected beauty of this place. It was cold, make no mistake. Felt like about 30 degrees, and my winter coat didn't keep me warm enough for my taste. But I am so glad I went. I wasn't disappointed. In fact, this lake, once again, far surpassed my expectations. I spent about an hour or so at the lake. I'm a serious amateur photography, and I got some good shots.

And DO NOT go without suncreen or bug spray. The mosquitos love the volcanic rock and will eat you alive! The boat tour is amazing, you can see so far down in the lake, it's almost like peering through glass! And they take you very near to the Ghost Ship and make a stop at Wizard Island. We didn't do any hiking on Wizard Island, but we intend to do so on our next visit.

We rode our bikes for a little ways which was fun, challenging (elevation) but treacherous as there is not a lot of shoulder.

Compared to last year, this time we found very little snow due to which water level seemed low. But, the beauty of the lake is still intact.There were some patches of snow where our son enjoyed. We enjoyed the serenity of the place. What did we do different this year?a) We stayed at Roseburg instead of Eugene so that reduced an hour's travel to crater lake.b) We stacked our cooler with beverages, cheese and packed ham-cheese-cracker lunch box. Also got some subs from Subway at Roseburg itself. This way we saved another hour of standing in the long queue at Rim Rock Cafe. Also, did not restrict us to choose our place and time to eat.c) We had hiking poles which definitely helped us in the trails.d) Carried our tripod for the camera to get some family pics for ourselves, to get better pics than selfies!e) Got good sunglasses as the sunlight from snow is too hurting.The restrooms outside the Rimrock cafe was clean and did share the load with the ones inside the cafe.It is such a wonder that we can visit it any number of times and will surely recommend anyone who does plan an Oregon trip to keep a day for Crater Lake!","May 31, 2015",Blue and serene,58,"Redmond, Washington",5

After the 20 minute film and a few minutes browsing in the gift shop, I went back up to the Rim Village. The fog had lifted to reveal the lake. Even overcast, the view of Crater Lake took my breath away! I can only imagine what it looks like, when the sun is shining in a cloudless sky! I stayed overnight at the Aspen Inn, and returned early Saturday morning. Again the lake was blanketed by fog, but after breakfast in the Lodge, the clouds had lifted and the lake reflected the steel grey clouds. It was brisk & cold, but a beautiful view!

It was an easy and beautiful drive to actually. We drove through several national parks to get to Crater Lake. There are several view points once you pass the entrance and it is nice to stop and look over as we did at almost all of them. You'll see different angles at each stop and find great opportunities for pictures and cliffs to explore. I highly recommend stopping at the Visitor Center to watch the 20 minute video it's informative and up to date. In my opinion, what makes Crater Lake amazing is the wonder and the facts about how it's come to be. There are also great posters at the gift shop upstairs for more fun facts.

Crater Lake National Park,"This was my first trip to this park and I must say I really enjoyed it. The lake was absolutely beautiful and peaceful. I didn't realize how much snow the park received though, so beware if you go in April. Not all of the roads were open and hiking trails were snow covered. I would love to go back when there is not so much snow on the ground.","May 17, 2015",Crater Lake National Park,29,michigan,4
Crater Lake National Park,It took a while to drive in to Crater Lake as one of the roads had not yet opened up after the winter - stop and ask the locals if it is open yet to save a long drive if it isn't. We were pleasantly surprised by how beautiful it was! We didn't stay long but it is a stunning spot and if you are in the area try to plan to make this side trip. It was cold and windy the day we went but we all agreed it had been worth the extra drive.,"May 14, 2015",Worth a side trip!,30,"Surrey, Canada",5
Crater Lake National Park,"What a beautiful lake!! We were afraid we would not see the lake because of the snow storm, but we did and it was so big!! We actually watched the storm cross the lake which was cool. The trees were draped in snow and there was about 2-3 feet of snow on the ground.

Crater Lake National Park,We visited in early May. The rim drive was closed but we were able to drive up to see the lake. It is an incredible lake with a cool story. The visitors center has a ranger made video that is free to watch about the formation of the lake - highly recommend. We spent 2 hours here - most of the park is closed until later in May so there is very little to do but the lake views alone are worth it. Not sure if there is an entrance fee this time of year (we have an annual pass).,"May 7, 2015",Early May visit,18,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Well worth the1.5 hour drive from Medford, Oregon. The lake is so blue that it seems like you are looking at a painting. Wish we had been there in summer so we could take the trolley around the lake. The roads around the lake were closed, but we were able to take a short hike to Discovery Point. From there, you are able to see the entire lake.There is a movie in the visitor center that has great info about crater lake origins and history.If mosquitos like you, bring bug spray (especially if you are hiking off the road). The village gift shop sells a ""Junipure outdoor body spray"" which is fantastic for stopping the itch from bites and rashes (i stock up when I go there).The restaurant at the village is good, but you may also want to try Beckie's at the Gorge.Also, no crater lake trip is complete without visiting the Rogue River Gorge. You can get a sense of the power of the river while standing safe behind a high fence.","May 4, 2015",The most beautiful blue lake you will ever see,17,"Gold Hill, OR",5
Crater Lake National Park,"While I was driving along the road to Crater Lake on Sun May 3, 2015, I couldn't help but notice the crazy volcanic activity that happened here many years ago. Water trapped at the bottom boiled to steam and forced its way up and left a unique melted cliffside view. As you get to the top of Rim Village and look down onto Crater Lake you can't help but notice how blue and beautiful the lake is. The lake looks surreal. It definitely one of the bluest lakes that I've ever seen. It would be nice if there was vehicle access to get to the lake so you can actually see the lake at water level. I noticed the huge old growth trees as I drove to the top. It makes you appreciate how untouched and protected this area is at Crater Lake. I'd definitely recommend coming here. Note that the North Entrance Road route is only open during the summer from Route 138. I made that mistake so I had to drive further south on the 97 to get here.","May 3, 2015",definitely a special place to be!,4,"Burnaby, Canada",5

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake National Park is a United States National Park located in southern Oregon. Established in 1902, Crater Lake National Park is the fifth oldest national park in the United States and the only one in the state of Oregon.[3] The park encompasses the caldera of Crater Lake, a remnant of a destroyed volcano, Mount Mazama, and the surrounding hills and forests.The lake is 1,943 feet (592 m) deep at its deepest point,[4] which makes it the deepest lake in the United States, the second deepest in North America and the ninth deepest in the world.This National Park encompasses 183,224 acres and the lake has no streams flowing into or out of it. The lake's water commonly has the most striking blue hue, and the lake is re-filled entirely from direct precipitation in the form of snow and rain.There is also an historic National Park Lodge for overnight stays and some rooms overlook the lake. What a joy to see this when you wake in the AM. You need to allow a full day for this side trip as it is about 1.5-2 hours off the I5 highway. Roads to the park are good and usually there is no traffic to speak of.","April 27, 2015",The most beautiful placce!,21,"Ashland, Oregon",5

It was well worth every second taking the winding roads with snow all over the place but the roads were well kept. We reached the Rim Center and then the lodge but that was as far as you could go. A short walk from your car and you can observe the awesome beauty of the lake with the snow covered edges around the entire lake. There is no lake like it, very serene and quiet.

Crater Lake's gorgeous scenery took my parents' breath away. While my mother has a bad leg and couldn't make the trip to go down to the bottom, she enjoyed herself to a great extent just walking around and staying in the shop. On the other hand, my father thoroughly enjoyed his adventure hiking. To top it off, it was snowing in June - It was THE perfect experience for my mother who never saw snow before in her life.

Crater Lake National Park,"So it's a really pretty lake if you're in the area. BUT. We knew April was still ""closed for snow season"" but figured it was worth a day trip to see the lake since the pics look beautiful. If you're not near by, I can't recommend this day trip. The reality is that it was a really long drive to basically see the pictures from a couple spots. We drove over from Eureka which with traffic/construction was about 5 hours one way.. With most of the roads closed we basically got to drive up... See the lake... Drive back. Tons of beautiful things to do in OR that were closer. Had it not been snow season I think we could have had a lot of fun on the hikes et al... So in general... If it's still snow season and you're not near by skip it. If you do go be aware this park has fewer signs than any park I've ever seen! Maybe they were snow covered but lots of long roads with no guidance you're getting closer/heading the right direction.","April 22, 2015",April... Beware!

Truly ""Wow"" inspiring!We were surprised that the north entrance to the park was not yet open for the season. Neither was the lodge. So there wasn't a lot going on. None of this was a problem, since mostly we wanted to go for a hike/walk and enjoy the views. Spend some time being utterly silent, and realize that all you can hear is the sound of wind moving through the trees.

A good romantic place to enjoy a special companion.Very much worth the drive in the Summer. It is usually closed in the Winter time,due to the huge amount of snow the rim receives.

But, when nature brings fog, travel about 1.5 hours to the West, and visit the Umpqua Valley Wineries, surrounding Roseburg, Oregon. There are 24 wineries within about 15 miles of Roseburg, Oregon.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater lake is one of a must see places when visiting Oregon. It’s our first stop on our road trip last year. The early evening we arrived Klamath Falls, Oregon we headed to Crater Lake to witness the sunset there. Weather was nice, although surrounded with snow and the Rim Drive is closed, we still enjoyed the breathtaking view of the Lake from the parking lot. The next morning we return back for the sunrise, but this time it is already snowing and can’t view the lake from anywhere around. So we decided to on to our next destination, but promise to go back next time.We stayed at Klamath Falls, Oregon for a night, cheaper rooms than the lodge inside the park, about 43miles away, plus you will enjoy the scenery along the way.Read more about our Crater Lake visit and more of our travels, go to-- www.goingplaces2gether.com","March 24, 2015",Must See,27,,5

It's cold and windy even at noon. When you stand high atop the rim of crater, you'll totally agree it has the best breathtaking view in Oregon. There's a gift shop where every tourist would go in to take a look. I bought a cup with the picture of Crater Lake which I love so much. However, never ever wash the cup in the dishwasher. It turns out the picture on the cup is just a film which would peel off here and there after washing. They should have put a notice there advising the cup is not suitable to be in the dishwasher.

Due to the low snow pack this year, the crater rim drive should be open sooner than usual. Call ahead to confirm.

Crater Lake National Park,"Of course a 5 star attraction -- one of the clearest lakes in the world, formed when a Cascade Mountain blew its top (like Mt. St. Helens to the north). As a native Oregonian, I've been several times, but learned on the latest trip that as the park has become more and more popular, it is increasingly difficult to get tickets for the boat trip, which is my favorite way to see Crater Lake. Available tickets go on sale at the kiosks the day before the trips, so this heavily favors people staying overnight in the area. Even then, you want to get to the kiosks as soon as your desired trip becomes available. If you're a day tripper, consider obtaining a reservation as soon as you're sure of your dates; otherwise, a midweek day early in the season seems like your best bet. If you can't get on the boat, it is still well worth a visit to drive around the lake and/or hike any of the various trails.","February 18, 2015",Oregon's Spectacular National Park,52,"Portland, Oregon",5

We suggest going to Watchman lookout which is about three quarters of a mile. It offers spectacular views of Wizard Island. We also took the morning boat tour to Wizard Island. We hiked to the summit but the view wasn't as great as it was from the rim although it was quite an experience. The Pinnacles Overlook was gorgeous although part of the road was under construction. It was kind of out of the way but was totally worth it. Do not miss Phantom Ship Overlook, it offers perfect views of the famed ""pirate ship"". A great hike for smaller kids is the Castle Crest wild flower garden. The trail winds through small grooves of trees across a small stream and through a beautiful wild flower field.

You can circumnavigate the entire crater and see the lake from a myriad of angles.

It's unforgettable. Do the reading, know exactly what you're seeing, it will make it all the more awesome. Drive the rim, take pictures from all viewpoints, visit the gift shop.

Crater Lake National Park,"I highly recommend Crater Lake to all nature lovers. It is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been to. The water is so clean and pure that the guide of the boat trip we took filled people's water bottles with water from the lake. It was pretty good. I have never seen water so clear and blue - it was just breath taking. There is a small window where there is no snow, in fact we went in July and there was still snow on the ground in some areas - so if you are like me are a complete coward when it comes to driving in bad weather, I would do some research first.","December 19, 2014",Just stunning,14,NC,5
Crater Lake National Park,My husband and I took a cross country trip in the fall of this year. Our goal was to see as many wonders as we could in this country. We were totally unprepared for the beauty of Crater Lake. The water in this lake that was formed by volcanic action is the bluest blue one could imagine. Visitors drive around the rim and view the lake from various sites. Each one was amazing. We really enjoyed an elegant lunch at the Crater Lake Lodge. I would reccommend this wonderful site to anyone wishing to see this beautiful country.,"December 18, 2014",One of the most beautiful places on earth.,4,"Reidsville, North Carolina, United States",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater lake is a sight to behold. We went there in the middle of bad weather in winter. But got lucky to have a clearing for a few hours and witness the fantastic view. It was a unique experience. Do some homework on the weather conditions and plan your visit accordingly. Summer/fall is recommended as the hiking trails are open and the lake is more accessible. The visitor center staff is very helpful and were promptly giving the best advice to get the most out of the visit. There is a cafe on top to have lunch viewing the lake. As far as we could see, the conveniences are not too destructive and does not distract from the natural setting. Being an amateur photographer, I couldnt get enough of the view from our first visit. Got to plan another visit in a better time.","December 8, 2014",BreathTaking,10,"Boston, Massachusetts",5

Crater Lake National Park,"If you are in the neighborhood, don't miss a visit to Crater Lake. This body of water was formed by a volcanic eruption eons ago, and is thousands of feet deep, making the water an unbelievably deep shade of blue. The drive around the lake allows you to view it from many vantage points and the photo opps are numerous. Take your time here and breathe in the special atmosphere of this extraordinary place. The surrounding countryside is also beautiful in all directions, and a trip here in the fall will provide lots of golden aspens to enjoy. Don't come too late in the year, though -- the road is closed as soon as snow makes it impassable, usually in November. The Lodge is a grand old building and also closes in late October most years.","December 4, 2014",The deepest blue!,27,California,5

I am also pretty sure that none of your photos will really capture how blue the water is or how expansive the view is. Even in panoramic! We took a day trip down there and drove around the lake. We went on some small trails but I wished we had more time to explore the area around the lake on foot. It is well worth the drive out there. My recommendation is to study up a little before you go. Learn a little about the geology and history. It will make the trip much more meaningful. Also, there is not a lot of ammenities around the area, so pack a cooler, snacks and sunscreen. If you forget something, you might have to drive a ways to get it.","December 2, 2014",I've always wanted to go - and now I have been there!,17,"Seattle, Washington",5

Crater Lake National Park,"When I was about 5 years old my dad took us to Crater Lake and for the past 50+ years it has been a standing joke about all the photo slides that my father had of the lake. It was on my bucket list to go back and visit this place again and I must say I was totally amazed at how beautiful the lake is. I now have hundreds of photos of my own of the lake and I'm sure my kids will one day laugh at my collection, but honestly it is one of the most beautiful places that I have seen in my entire life and you just can't miss it! Now some advice and feedback: You need about 5 hours to really see the lake and to be able to stop at all the pull outs, the 3 hours that they recommend is not enough time (we did a 30 min hike too at the Godfrey Glen trail, nice spires along the way). Bathrooms are few and far between. Go on a sunny day as the photos are stunning but I think a cloudy day might be another story. Dogs are only allowed on 2 trails so that was disappointing. Bring a lunch and have a picnic overlooking this beautiful lake! We noticed that there is very poor signage as we never really knew where we were at most times, yet they give you a beautiful handout explaining the park with a good map but they should put up signs too.","November 4, 2014","Just amazing, you have to go and see for yourself!",10,"British Columbia, Canada",5
Crater Lake National Park,The most breathtakingly beautiful place I have ever seen. Go the week after Labor Day and spend at least 2-3 days there. Crater Lake Lodge is older but extremely beautiful and well maintained. You have to book the room a year in advance. There are very few places to spend the night so plan early. Also I suggest bringing a cooler of drinks and food/snacks because meals up at the lodge are pricey. It's worth taking the trek down to the lake for the two hour boat ride. You see Crater Lake from a whole different perspective. Book the lodge through Xanterra Parks and Resorts. You have a much better chance of getting a room......but remember to plan early!!!

Crater Lake National Park,"On a trip from Southern California arrived to fog, cold, rain and snow. Ranger at entrance suggested we might not want pay the $10 fee and go into the park due to the rare complete inability to see the lake. We, nonetheless, proceeded and stopped to see a fascinating short film about the lake at the first visitor stop. At the location they had closed circuit TV'S showing the snow and lack of visibility. They indicated we could at one spot on the north Shore hike to the lake and possibly see a bit of the water. Since the drive, however, could be difficult they were not particularly encouraging. We went anyway. Our first stop on the 30 mile plus loop of the lake was a winter wonderland of snow and ice. Actually a bit fun for us since we rarely see ""weather"". Although no views or visability we continued. By the third stop there were some slight vague views as there was a little thinning in the cloud cover. And then at the next stop the clouds began to open little by little and oh my. The lake is marvelous to behold and I am certain would be stunning on a clear calm day. What we experienced, however, is beyond words. We were left stunned by the magnificent display of the interplay between wind and wave, sun and cloud, darkness and color, lake and land and sky. Perhaps just a small taste in a view of the creation of what the Creator holds for us in the life yet to come?","October 30, 2014",Wow.,18,,5
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater lake is worth the detour! We enjoyed the short 25 minute film about the creation of the lake, the exhibit room (located on a steep walk down from the rim park), and, even if just for a few minutes, the view is breathtaking (as well as unique). I would avoid the trolley ride (unless you feel the $22-$26 feel is appropriate) and the driving the rim drive (agree with previous reviewer in that the views are pretty much the same and not as many as you would think). Note that many facilities may be closed beginning fall through spring (regardless of weather).Aside, if anyone from the National Park Service even reads these reviews, please instruct/train your personnel at the entrance to greet people with a smile or an hello/welcome.

Crater Lake National Park,"crater lake is a bit out of the way to get to, but so beautiful. relaxing, calming, restorative. our roadtrip got us there the beginning of october, and because of the snows were late, the lodge should have been closed, but wasn't. in fact, when i called months earlier to make reservations, the website said it would be closed. when we got there...it wasn't. so we had to stay a little distance away at diamond lake resort, which turned out fine, but how much better it would have been to just walk outside and see the spectacular blue. the roads around the lake (east and west rim drives) are a must. there are signed pull outs allowing you to see the different aspects of the lake, phantom ship, wizard island, etc. the visibility and view depends on the lay of the sun. and, truthfully, after going one-half to three-quarters of the way around, the gorgeous scenic delights do become a bit ho-hum. but chances are you'll not be back again, so indulge yourself.the lodge reminds me of the other great national park lodges inside and out. beautiful wood and expansive areas. we were too late to take advantage of the boat tour of the lake, you'd have to call not check the website to confirm their season of operation.","October 28, 2014",beautiful gem,164,"Brookings, Oregon",5

For me a few days was enough, however its a really fun few days. The main campground is usually either full or overcrowded. I hight recommend going to a campground thats further in the park. You should definitely hike to the to the peak of Mt. Garfield. Its the highest point in the park and has amazing panoramic views of Crate Lake. Depending on how long you stay there, it really should't take you more than a couple of hours to hike up and down Mt. Garfield. And of course you must hike down the Cleetwood Trail and take a swim in the crystal clear lake water. Its a bit chilly but worth it.

I would highly suggest making sure that if you are traveling there in the off season to check online or call to make sure areas are open that you wish to see. For instance the Eastern rim drive was completely closed during our visit but the Western rim drive was open and provided spectacular views.

Crater Lake National Park,"There are lots of magnificent things to see in Oregon. None is more spectacular than Crater Lake. You really have one of those ""oh-my...."" speechless times when you first step up to the rim and look at the Lake. It's a crazy perspective. It's appears large but you cannot really get it clear in your head until you see a boat going across the water. It's so terribly small, you realize how high up you are. The village is a nice diversion, but the overlooks are amazing, and the drive around the canyon can be very unnerving. One big point--there are two ways to drive to Crater Lake from the I-5, from the South and from the North. North is Highway 58. It's a straight long drive, and halfway to the Lake is a town called Oakridge. It's a good old fashioned speedtrap. Four lanes that are 35 mph forever. Oregon plates will be passing you like crazy but if you are out of state, you can't be driving any faster. Just google Oakridge and speedtrap and you'll see.

Crater Lake National Park,"We visited on Aug 12 after planning this trip for 1 year. As I look at the other traveler's photos, it was the reason we wanted to see this breathtaking high altitude, blue lake, well... We had a miserable experience. We only planned 1 day at the park, not expecting bad weather.It is a mountain climate and weather changes very unexpectedly. We had booked a boat tour of the lake 6 months in advance and this was cancelled due to weather, in fact, all the boat tours were canceled because of the severe thunderstorm and large hail that occurred all day. This storm knocked out ALL the power, so the gift shops were dark, no restaurants or food, no pumping of gas and it was very cold at 40 degrees. We did not prepare for cold, or rain so we could not hike or enjoy any part of Crater Lake. Also there is no hotel or campground closer than 1 hour to the park. It is very much out of the way to anything in the area. I wish we would have stayed at lodge at Crater lake, but it is expensive and very difficult to get reservations.I think this is an amazing park from the photos and reviews we have seen. I do not think we will attempt to return, because Crater lake is so far from anything in Oregon.Fill your car with gas before you drive to Crater Lake, there is only 1 gas station in the park and the next gas station is more than an hour away. Power outages are common and no power = no pumping gas. Many people were stranded for hours waiting for the power to return to get gas. The power was out for more than 6 hours.The drive around the rim was difficult due to heavy rain and large hail which formed ice on the road. There was a major construction delay, more than 30 minutes of waiting from the road being closed due to construction/ blasting work.I think our average experience was due to our lack of flexibility and poor planning for extreme weather.The Rangers, staff and beauty of the park is amazing, we did not see the park at its best.","October 14, 2014","Worst weather ruined our trip to Crater Lake, cancelled boat trip..ugh",121,"Vancouver, Canada",3

The trees were bent over and bare on one side from the force of the winds. It is a harsh and severe environment. The park service offers a 20 minute video at the visitor's center.

Right before the actual Park entrance is Mazama Village. This is a good place to look for a souvenir, take a break or grab something to eat. We were on the way to Bend and only had the morning at the Lake. If you have to choose one side, I recommend the West Rim Drive, because this offers more views of the crater. However, if you do the entire circle drive, start with the West Rim and drive counter clockwise. This will put you on the lake side of the road and this is easier to hit the many scenic turnouts. It was October and were very lucky there was no snow yet. Even though The Lodge was closing up for the winter, we did go into the lobby and enjoy the large, roaring fireplace. Outside there are rocking chairs overlooking the Lake and rim. We are going to book way in advance and stay there next time. The park map shows all of the overlooks and picnic areas. While at Rim Village do take the rock stairs and see the view from Sinnott Memorial Overlook. Take plenty of water and sunscreen.

You will need plan far in advance if you want lodging inside the park during the summer as well as reservations for lake boat tours.If you visit the lake, I recommend a day on the lake taking the lake boat tour and the Wizard Island 1/2 day tour (if you can get the combo lake/wizard island tour that is the best). It is a whole different perspective being on the lake as well as getting a tour guide narrative. Spending 3 hours on the Wizard Island is also a great experience. You can research these tours online for more details.The 33 mile loop rim drive is highlighted by about 6 main viewpoints (the best spots) along with many smaller pull-offs you can choose. Each stop gives you a different perspective. Make sure you stop at the visitor center or download a rim drive guide to help you on your drive. The signage around the lake is adequate but not too detailed. Make sure you take the time to go to the Pinnacles overlook too. Short easy trails to th Plaikni Falls, Vidae Falls, and the Pinnacles Trail add to the overall rim experience. If you have to stay out of the park for lodging, the Best Western Hotels in Medford and Klamath Falls are very good.

We then arrived through the North entrance and quickly got our first view of this beautiful lake and Wizard island. The colour was stunning. We slowly drove round the lake stopping off at various stop offs. Driving down the 6 mile spur road to the pinnacles was well worth it. The road is paved.

The best views were just in front of Crater Lake Lodge where the CCC built short trails to perfectly framed postcard views.Highly recommended.Take the rim drive, but plan to get out of your car often for short stops of different scenic views. I also recommend the Pinnacles area, Cloudcap Overlook and pretty much any trail so you can experience the peace and solitude of this great American park.","September 30, 2014",Beautiful uncrowded park.

Crater Lake National Park,"When planning our trip out west we asked everyone what to go and see. The one constant was Crater Lake. Everyone said, ""It's out of the way, but so worth it"". Well... they did not disappoint me. We drove up here on a rainy cold day and it was still amazing. It was so foggy in some spots we couldn't even see the water, but kept driving anyway. There are many spots to stop and take photos. We ended up in 40 degree, sleet/rain, and high winds. Even still we wanted to keep going. By the end of the trip it had cleared enough for us to get some amazing photos. We probably missed 50% of what we wanted to really see well, but were still amazed. We will return one day to really take it all in. No regrets!","September 30, 2014","Truly amazing, and only a visit to the park does justice.",43,"Beloit, Wisconsin",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is beautiful! We stayed in the lodge which was fairly typical of National Parks. The lobby and common areas are large and comfortable. Our room was a fair size, but had no storage area (3 hooks), 1 queen bed, 1 straight back chair, 1 table and lamp. The only other lighting in the room was in the corner by the sink or inside the bathroom. We had to use the chair as a night stand on one size of the bed, which meant everytime we wanted to sit down (to put on shoes or the like) we had to remove the travel alarm, book, watch, and the hiking headlamp that we had to use to read in bed! The food in the dinning room was good, but in many choices overpriced. The park is beautiful and if you can do the hike to the boat tour landing, DO IT! The info on the boat tour clearly states it is a challenging trail to the water's edge - very true. It took us 35 min. to go down the trail, and our knees were hurting. The tour was fabulous. The ranger on our tour was informative as well as entertaining. On returning to the dock, you have to hike back up the trail - it took us over an hour and it was exhausting, but well worth it.","September 29, 2014",Unique place to visit,47,"Wheaton, Illinois",4
Crater Lake National Park,"It's kind of a long drive to get there from pretty much anywhere, but it's so worth it. The views are spectacular, the lake is simply amazing. Even if you don't drive the whole rim, definitely hit a few of the pullouts and walk around a bit. I've visited a few times and have come to the conclusion that it's pretty much impossible to take a bad photo at Crater Lake. They have some fun stuff in the gift store, as well. The one down side is there's not much lodging nearby. Crater Lake Lodge tends to fill up well in advance, and everything else is a fair drive away.","September 29, 2014",In the middle of nowhere but a must see,43,"Northern Great Plains, USA",5

Day 1 was beautiful as we drove around and stopped at each pull out, ending the day waiting for glorious sunset. The next day as we arrived to explore more by hiking, a thick bank of smoke from California fires snuggled in above the lake.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake...the tour guides do not lie. This place is super fabulous. A few hints. We entered on the southern end and drove up the west side thus avoiding being on the edge of a lot of steep drop-offs (we noticed a number of drivers going the other way driving on the yellow line!). The fee is still only $10/car and at least while we were there, they are allowing dogs on leashes). Going in mid-Sept., mid week was perfect. The weather was mild and the traffic very light (we were stopped twice with road repairs -- looked like mini-craters on the road from falling rocks!). To see it all, pull over and stop wherever you can. There are turn-outs all along the road. The Lookouts are wonderful. The guide given at the entrance to the Park is extremely well done and tells you about the overlooks and hikes, by level of difficulty. Do not miss The Pinnacles Overlook. It is about six miles off the main road and really worth the extra time. Also good to know is that restrooms are convenient, clean and welcome especially if you make the trip like we did -- it took us over 4 hours to drive the circumference and we are so glad we took the time.","September 27, 2014",A blowup that left such a beautiful place,47,"Portland, Oregon",5

There are many viewpoints, each giving a fabulous view of the lake. We took so many photos and I am sure we could have taken a lot more. We stayed at Union Creek in a log cabin and travelled to the lake. Then we stayed at Klamath Falls at a Best Western Hotel which was fabulous.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is Beautiful. One thing about this National Park you can see so much from your car if you are not up to walking. By driving the rim road, stopping at the scenic pull outs and the Lodges.   The rim road is 33 miles however if you stop to enjoy all the beautiful views etc. you will still need a good day. And hopefully take a short walk or hike. Best to drive the 33 mile rim road going clockwise.Why clockwise:Better views of the Lake. Plus safer. Most pull outs will be on your right side of the road the lake side. And you will not have to pull across the on coming traffic lane to get to them. There seem to be a lot of pull outs for scenic views, at some of them parking was a problem. For those driving counter clockwise, the narrow road is not the best place to have to back up and turn around and pull across the road to proceed.  I would pack a lunch. Also it can be windy. The day we went it was VERY VERY windy. We didn’t dare open both car doors at the same time. We packed a picnic lunch but It was so windy we found a place to park that had a nice view of the Lake and ate our picnic lunch in the car. Weather was not the best the day we were there, HOWEVER it was still beautiful and a wonderful day. We got up very early and drove in from Sutherlin 101 miles about 2 hrs to the park.","September 24, 2014","If walking is a problem, you can see a lot from your car.",345,"Houston, Texas",5

The still blueness of the water makes a striking contrast with the sheer cliff faces, crater sides, that surround it. There may be people everywhere, that's to be expected, but you still feel a sense of serenity as you gaze onto the expanse of deep, deep blue below you. We had our dog with us and that really was the only hiccup. He wasn't allowed in many of the different hiking trails and paths.

Can't stress that enough - get out of the car and enjoy this place! Definitely recommend Wizard Island, Mount Scott, Watchman, and all other lookouts/turnouts. The gift shops/business places were pretty disappointing. I wish they had a better selection of books and maps instead of the usual junk. But that's not the reason to go there. The LAKE is the reason to go. Definitely check ahead for boat schedule, weather, fires around the area, etc. All can impact your trip. Plan on the drive taking longer than you think so you can stop and see things and enjoy the trip. Don't rush.

The Pinnacles--a must visit to see these marvelous stone spires shaped from volcanic action and erosion. Plaikni Falls--a hike through a forest to a snowmelt creek with a waterfall.

The rim drive gives outstanding views but if it is hazy or there are forest fires you will miss the extraordinary blues of the lake water. The water is more like a Caribbean ocean than a mountain lake. There is only one trail leading down to the water and it is pretty strenuous (both going down and the return trip uphill) but well worth it. The Ranger focuses on geology of the site, the Native American perspective and the biologist's perspective and it was really enjoyable and packed in a lot of information and unforgettable scenery.

Be prepared, It's 7,000-8,000 feet above sea level and exercise will be harder. And it's colder, too. And windy.","September 9, 2014",sublime,7,Glendive,5

Crater Lake National Park,"First bring your camera for some great photos and also bring a good pair of hiking shoes. You can see most of the park in one day. The rim trail drive is very scenic and you should take time to stop at the scenic view points. There are so many trail so take the time to get out of the car to get some exercise and remember the sun here is very bright and can burn your skin easily so wear a lot of sunscreen. Most of the services like food, souvenirs', and apparel are found near the lodge area and main visitor center. This is a remote park but one that you should visit and enjoy.","September 7, 2014",You must see this natural wonder!,93,"Scottsdale, Arizona",5
Crater Lake National Park,"a MUST see, unique in its beauty & creation. Stunning vistas from the 1st glimpse! We stayed at the Crater Lake lodge rimside of the lake. The informational talks the rangers provide are very interesting regarding the formation of the lake. They describe how the depth was measured back in the 1800's with a piano wire dropped down & that the measurement was actually very close to the real lake depth. The formation of the lake by multiple volcano's was especially interesting to us, being from Hawaii where there are active volcano's present.The views at sunset & sunrise are easily accessible, hikes to the see the sunset at the old fire lookout are worth the effort to hike up 650', 1.6 miles....take your time to catch your breath....and dress warmly cause its windy up top. The stars are huge & very clear at night, not having to compete with the city lights at all. Its as if you could reach out & touch a part of heaven!!!GO & ENJOY this wonder of nature!

Crater Lake National Park,"After reading about the inspiration behind Crater Lake I longed to see it for myself. I drove from Bend, Oregon. I was amazed as I drove to the Northern entrance of the park at the desolate and lovely landscape. Upon arrival I stopped at all the view points around the lake as recommended by a friend. I also walked through the lodge which is rustic and historic. After lunch at the larger visitor's center I located the second one and from there took a hike to enjoy wild flowers. Repair work was underway as the road had just been opened for the summer. At the end of the day I walked to the base of the lake where the water cruises launch and enjoyed watching young people jumping from the rocks to the lake below. A water excursion would consume much of the day. A hike is also available on Wizard Island. The views were all stunning!","September 5, 2014",National Wonder!,23,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We came up from the south entrance and didn't see it until we came to the Rim Village. When I first saw it, I was amazed at the beautiful blue of the water and the size of the lake. I believe it was a $10 entrance fee per vehicle. To me, the scenery seemed more dramatic in the west rim more than the east. The east rim had some road construction going on as there is a problem with falling rock. Crater Rim Drive is a bit narrow and the road has a steep drop off in many places on the edge. A 22 minute film is shown in the visitor center every half hour. We spent about 4 hours here and covered it thoroughly for the most part. I really enjoyed this park.","September 5, 2014",Simply Spectacular!,778,"Marlton, New Jersey",5

If you want a nice place to go outdoors this is a must. I am planning to go camping at the well maintained campsite. The day we were their it was raining off and on. It was still beautiful.

Plenty of parking at each spot and absolutely stunning views on the lake. We climbed up to the The Watchman lookout tower, which was incredible. Hard to describe, you are so high up and have such an amazing view all round.... We also saw a bald eagle soar by, incredible! Lunch at the cafe was also great, really fresh food and reasonably priced. I can highly recommend visiting Crater Lake, it is well worth the drive (and seeing LOTs do pine trees on the way). The fee to get in was only $10 for the car, a really good deal!","September 3, 2014",Amazing!!,23,"Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand",5
Crater Lake National Park,"If you are in Oregon and have time, do not miss visiting Crater Lake National Park. It is the deepest lake in the U.S. and is a brilliant blue.Take time to drive the entire rim of the lake. This will give you a chance to pull over on many over looks to get different views of the lake. There is also a boat ride available which we did not have time to take but we heard it is worth it.Hotels are sparse in this area so be sure to go online and book something before you go there. You may have to stay an hour away so keep that in mind when planning your trip. We were fortunate to stay in Diamond Lake Resort about 20 mins away but it gets booked quickly. There is also Crater Lake Lodge within the park but it gets very booked months in advance.

It is an area you definitely want to take the time to do some hiking or at least make many stops at different view points around the lake. Fortunately we arrived while the sun was shining and we visited the area around the lodge but when we started our drive around the lake it started to pour. Not a good time to sightsee. Stopped at Beckie's cafe in Union Creek for a delicious piece of pie on our way back to Medford.,"September 3, 2014",A national park not to be missed,13,"Glendora, California",5
Crater Lake National Park,It might be 5 hours from Portland but it is well worth the trip. This is a one of a kind setting.

There are plenty of places to hike and the water really is that blue!,"September 3, 2014",Well worth the drive,11,"Columbus, Ohio",5
Crater Lake National Park,Crater lake is beautiful and the boat tour can only increase your appreciation of this unique place. You catch the boat at Cleetwood Cove on the north side of the lake. Make sure you get tickets in advance. The hike down (and back up) is fairly steep but it is beautiful and you can take your time. The great thing about this tour is that you see the lake at water level and learn about the various formations and the particular environment. That knowledge then enhances the experience you have on drives or hikes along the rim - it changes your perspective.,"September 3, 2014",Crater Lake Boat Tour,0,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Crater Lake National Park,"The water, its all about the water. Blue doesn't touch the colors. Azure, turquoise, orange, green and deep deep blue.We drove in the north entrance and took the east rim drive. I think we stopped at every turn out, as you should. Every view is different. If you think, nah not this stop, you will miss out.The weather was perfect. It was breezy and you are up there in altitude. Take a coat, wear long pants--we were here in August and it was only 55 degrees....yup.....55. The wind whips around too. I wished at a couple spots I had gloves.There are short trails for different views--nice vantages for pictures.Hadn't been here in years, and took a different route this time. I would recommend doing the full circle drive if you haven't been here, but plan on all day (*You have to go to the Pinnacles. Its about 6 miles from the rim drive--GO THERE. You won't believe what you see.......so worth it.","September 3, 2014",Oh the views--and the blues,95,"Portland, Oregon",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We visited in August. We had reservations to go on the boat tour and as soon as we arrived to the Crater a storm rolled in. It hailed about a half of an inch! The temperature dropped to 44 degrees! Needless to say, we were freezing! Since the lodge and the tourist shop has no electricity and boat tours were cancelled we just drove the 30 plus miles around and stopped at most of the vantage points and took pictures. Breathtaking even through the storm. I visited the lake 45 years ago and it took me this long to come back. Even though we had some bad weather it was sure worth seeing.","September 3, 2014",Beautiful!,71,"New York City, New York",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We opted for the 2hr tour, rather than Wizard Island tour, so we could do the rim drive (also recommended). The walk down Cleetwood cove is as strenuous as they say. Don't underestimate it. But if you leave yourself enough time to get up/down, it's not that bad really. Definitely worth it and the hike down is scenic and you get a closer up look of the inside of the rim. The water is amazingly clear and blue. You can drink it right out of the lake too. We refilled our water bottles after the tour right from the lake.We had Ranger Brian for our tour and he was excellent and informative, while injecting just the right amount of humor to make it extra fun. Bring a jacket/windbreaker. You will get splashed by waves a bit. We had good weather, but I'd imagine if it was cloudy, it would be pretty cold.Don't forget to bring water, sunblock, jacket, good shoes, snacks, a camera, sunglasses. You can buy some snacks/gatorade at the Cleetwood cove parking lot too.I'd say our experience surpassed expectations.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake will take your breath away, for its beauty and amazing setting at 7000 ft. elevation in the mountains of southern Oregon. When planning a trip to Crater Lake, allow time to take in at least three of the short hikes (from 1/2 hour to 2 hours) in the national park. These are three of my favorite hikes at Crater Lake: Sun Notch trail will give you a view of the lake that is different from the viewpoints along the rim road. Many visitors to Crater Lake consider the Sun Notch view to be the best of all! As an added bonus, The Phantom Ship is right below Sun Notch. The Watchman trail is wonderful anytime, but if you happen to be able to take this hike just before sunset, the view of the setting sun from the Watchman is extraordinary! Castle Crest wildflower trail affords stunning up close views of wildflowers amidst a beautiful stream that flows near to the Park headquarters.","September 2, 2014",Not-to-miss short hikes at Crater Lake National Park,7,"Portland, Oregon",5

We thought we would take the 2 mile hike down and back to the lake but it was a little more strenuous than we wanted to do in the late afternoon heat. But the views from the rim and rim village were great. The 20 minute movie was well worth watching. Be sure to grab one of the great photo books in the gift shop. Oh my daughter was proposed too here. So the proposal pics will be spectacular,","September 2, 2014",Beautiful views,14,Washington,5

The water is a blue like I've never seen in a lake before, and the scenery all around is gorgeous. If you are into hiking there trails everywhere, from easy and handicap accessible to miles up a mountain. The only drawback was that the Crater lake Lodge is really the only hotel nearby. We stayed at the Aspen Inn in Fort Klamath, which was about an hour from the lake. We have been to many of the national parks, and didn't really know much about this one. I would definitely recommend a visit.","September 1, 2014",unbelievable view!,29,"Grant, Michigan",5
Crater Lake National Park,"It's out of the way, and when you get there, there isn't much to do other than look at it. But its beauty is indescribable. Here's the ""Honest Scoop"":1. Rim Drive, which circles the lake has a million places to stop and view the lake from its various angles.2. There is the requisite gift shop filled with garage sale items as far as the eye can see.3. The food is standard park fare - consider eating at the last town before hitting the final stretch to the lake.4. You can hike down to the water's edge at Cleetwood Trail. It's very steep, but unless you have health problems or are seriously out of shape, you can do it.5. You can take an over-priced boat tour of the lake - we didn't, and I can't see ever doing so.For a humorous take on our trip, visit: http://jocularious.com/?p=413","August 31, 2014",A Must See,46,"Eugene, Oregon",5

Crater Lake National Park,This was my fourth visit to Crater Lake. Crater Lake has got to be one of the most peaceful and serene places on this earth. Every view is breathtaking and every photo taken is picture post card perfect. Great bargain because it is only $10.00 to get into the national park or free if you have Senior Citizens National Park Pass. I was staying in Bend Oregon and it was an easy drive to Crater Lake. Had lunch at the Crater Lake Lodge and sat in one of the rocking chairs on the veranda that looks out over the entire Crater Lake area. I could have sat there all day!

Even in person, it doesn't look real and even after staring at it, its hard to believe its real! We did a boat tour over to Wizard Island and hiked to the top of that.. while the hike was a bit strenuous, it was just unbelievable once you got to the top. I will say trying to find the place where you park before you hike down to the boat isn't marked well at all. The other hike that we loved was Garfield's Peak... again not an easy hike but that was by far the best part of my vacation.

Crater Lake National Park,"I really enjoyed the trip to Crater Lake National Park in southern Oregon with my son and daughter. I read other reviews on TripAdvisor to get an idea of what to expect, and this sixth oldest national park in the U.S. met all of my expectations and more! We drove through the North Entrance to the park from Highway 97, and after paying the $10.00 entrance fee (for a family car) we were amazed, after a few miles of driving, with the rather stunning vista that awaited us. That first view that you see of the lake is just awesome!!! Your jaw will drop when you see the six-mile wide caldera filled with the most stunningly beautiful blue water in the world that you'll ever see! We stayed at the Mazama Village Cabins (much preferred over the lodge, which is more expensive and a bit crowded) and drove the Rim Drive to go from one look-out point to another. Parts of the Rim Drive were inaccessible due to highway construction, so those areas had to be traveled after 4 or 5 pm when the construction crews left their work for the day. When you go make sure you can take one of the three boat tours that the National Park Service offers on the lake. My family and I took the standard boat tour for $37.00 per adult, and it is well worth the price. You have to get to the boat hiking down Cleetwood trail which is easy enough going down (takes about 30 or so minutes), but can be a rather strenuous hike back up to the Rim Drive, taking up to an hour or more to return to the parking lot. There is no TV or phone service to speak of on top of the mountain, although there is wi-fi but that is sketchy and limited to those who are guests of the lodge and cabins. Oh, there are no pets (dogs) allowed on the national park service trails, and no dogs allowed on the boat tours, so for those who are pet owners be advised that if you do bring your animals on the trails you will be asked by park service staff to take them away and shelter them elsewhere.

Crater Lake National Park,"We only had one complaint about the park and that was that they had a run on the rim road that nearly caused us to miss our boat tour. There was no notification given the tour operators by the park management, and there was no one keeping race fans from driving next to their runners at 5 miles an hour talking and encouraging them. It made those of us who can only visit a place like this once in a lifetime second class citizens. The hike down to the tour boat was ok, but we realized it was going to be a hard hike out. It is 1.1 miles of switchbacks and 700 feet of elevation change. The boats are big and easy to take pictures from. We got the tour to Wizard Island and were left there for 3 hours to hike. We made it to the top of Wizard volcano (760 feet up in 1.1 miles), and got some great pics. It was worth the effort. The caldera is small and the view is awesome. After we got down we enjoyed talking to the park volunteer who let us know that the park director loves runs and was not good about letting the tour people know about the events. We then got on the tour boat and saw the rest of the inside of the crater from the water. The hike out took an hour, but we made it.","August 28, 2014",Really Blue Water,60,,5

A minimum of two hours driving the south rim will leave you with memories that will last a lifetime. I was last here in 1962 and never forgot it.

Only 1 entrance was open & snow was higher than the motor home.Was gray & foggy & could barely see the lake. This time we figured would be able to see the lake since it was Aug, had heat wave & wildfires burning. Started raining on way & also had hail.Was still raining when we got to the visitor center. We only did the west rim the 1st day because of the rain & road closures on east rim. They are working on road so couldn't drive all the way around & couldn't get to the Pinnacles. The roads were supposed to be open after 5pm so we waited at turnoff until road was open, then drove to Pinnacle. . We were able to see the whole lake this time (but it was not a ""beautiful blue color) and the island & ghost ship. So be prepared for all kinds of weather even though it is summer!!

Even though we were there on a cloudy day, it was still beautiful, just not as clear as in most photos. We even got to see some wildlife in the form of chipmunks and deer.

Crater Lake National Park,"Unique lake in the US with a deep blue color. Has one of the highest clarity in the world and the 9th deepest lake in the world. Thank goodness it is a national park which has preserved its beauty. Easily accessible by car and has good lodging right on the lake (Crate Lake Lodge). Would highly recommend hiking up Garfield Peak, Watchman tower, the Pinnacles and Mt. Scott. Great dining at Annie Creek restaurant. Book at least 8 mths in advance if staying at the lodge.","August 23, 2014","undescribable beauty, phots cannot do justice",167,"Worcester, Massachusetts",5
Crater Lake National Park,"What a lovely first visit to this beautiful national park. We were able to drive all around the rim and view the lake from various focal points. It's a photographer's heaven! We stopped at the visitor's center to see a film about how Crater Lake was formed, which we found very interesting. We were amazed by how many shades of blue the water contained.","August 23, 2014",Beautiful Park,192,"Buckeye, Arizona",4

Crater Lake National Park,A truly remarkable experience. The clearest and blue-est water I have ever seen (I think this lake actually does have the clearest/purist water in the world). We stopped at many of the overlooks and it was beautiful at all angles. The Phantom Ship was a favorite of mine. We saw many people pack their food and we wished we would have planned ahead to do the same as both the cafe and restaurant were very pricey.,"August 22, 2014",Must See,69,"Williamsport, Pennsylvania",5

Crater Lake National Park,"We drove from Bend for a day trip, and it was well worth it. We did the short but steep Garfield Peak hike, and were rewarded with excellent views. Even though we were there in July, there were still small patches of snow (not on the trail, though). It is of course a major tourist attraction so expect crowds.","August 20, 2014",Beautiful but crowded,11,"Vancouver, Canada",4
Crater Lake National Park,"Wow, what a beautiful place. Very quiet there. Amazing what mother nature can do to please us puny humans. This place was very difficult to find overnight accommodation (sold out) so we stayed in Klamath Falls, which is about an hour away from Crater Lake. Make sure and plan well ahead so you can stay in Crater Lake. I think it would be well worth staying there to see sunsets and sunrises. If I had to do it again, I would make sure I stayed on site - amazing.","August 19, 2014",Stunning vista,47,Canada,5
Crater Lake National Park,"Hadn't been there since 20 years ago. Since it was an overcast day, the water was a different color. But it was still breathtaking!! We only drove from the north to the south around the west side, where the store was; The rim area.A thunder & lightening storm hit below and knocked out power. Then it started to rain. Fortunately we got in our viewing first. There is construction in some areas.Can't wait to go back.","August 19, 2014",Breathtaking still!,16,,4
Crater Lake National Park,"I have always enjoyed going to Crater Lake. We have hiked near it, camped there and visited several times. This last trip, though, we decided to take the boat tour to Wizard Island. We hiked down into the crater which was amazing. The trail is well groomed, there are spectacular views and benches for just resting and taking it all in. Once at the boat launch at the bottom we were told our boat was having mechanical issues so we could not go on the tour. The staff handled it beautifully even though many people were very rude to them. We, however, had a GREAT time even without the boat tour. We had our picnic in the crater and just enjoyed the entire experience. Once at the top we again heard many angry and rude people talking with the staff. Again, the staff was professional. Kudos to them!!! We were given a full refund without any snags or issues. Anyway, we had such a beautiful trip, enjoyed talking with the rangers and staff, met some fun people, and just soaked in the beauty of this place. Crater Lake is one of my favorite places and everyone should experience its beauty at least once. You won't be sorry.","August 19, 2014",Amazingly beautiful place,43,"Albany, Oregon",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Always wanted to visit; glad we finally did. Crater Lake is amazing all by itself, just to gaze at. The Ranger-led trolley ride around the 33 mile rim was comfortable, fun and informative. There were many stops at spots for photos & viewing. Also enjoyed rim talks at a visitor center and the lodge back porch. It is a hiker's heaven but still appreciated by those of us with walking issues. Time for a side trip? Make the drive to the pinnacles, huge strange formations of hot gas/ash mixtures from the eruption 8000 years ago. We stayed at the lodge which had uneven service, but what a view!","August 18, 2014",Beautiful Blue Wonder of OR,7,"New Lenox, Illinois",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Carved by massive volcanic eruption thousands of years ago Crater Lake in southern part of Oregon state was our recent stopover on way to Reno, Nevada. It was worth the eastbound detour we made from Highway 1 to see the deep blue lake while driving along its rim. Unlike most other lakes Crater Lake is viewed down from the circular 33 miles rim. The drive has several vista points with parking and washroom facilities. There are both easy and strenuous hiking trails going down the lake where one can feel the water and taste its purity as well. Guided map and other information are handed over at the Crater Lake Park entrances.","August 18, 2014",Viewing The Lake Atop Its Rim,25,Vancouver,5

The rim drive was beautiful & relaxing lots of opportunities to pull off the side of the highway and snap photos. There are two establishments that serve food & beverage, the one is located in the Lodge & the other in the tacky souvenir shop. Both are way overpriced in their food & drink! Save some greenbacks & pack your own food & drink for the visit. The food is not worth the cost, trust me.","August 17, 2014",Wonderful views! Overpriced food!,24,"Nelson, Canada",4
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is one of the most beautiful National parks I've been to. The views of the lake and surrounding peaks are spectacular. You never know what the weather will be like in the summer, we lucked out by having beautiful blue skies the entire time we were there. The boat ride on the lake gives you a different perspective on view. A park ranger is on board gives you a history of the park. If you do want to take the boat ride you have to in good enough shape to walk the 1.1 mile trail down 700 feet to the lake and be able to walk back up . Make sure drive the road around the rim of the crater, there are a lot of overlooks and short trails to hike.","August 17, 2014",A natural wonder at it's best,173,"Franklin, North Carolina",5
Crater Lake National Park,"I highly suggest you do the 2hr trolley ride. You get a park ranger who entertains you & the kids for the entire ride giving facts, asking questions. You stop about 5 or 6 times for photos & more things to learn. It definitely gave you an appreciation of what you were looking at. Tip of the day is to sit in the last row as it's more leg room & sit on 2 foam pads. It's a classic trolley with shallow wood seats, they hand out those foam knee boards to sit on. Ask for 2 as the roads are bumpy and your rear will thank me. :)","August 15, 2014","Beautiful, do the trolley!",9,"Manhattan Beach, California, United States",5
Crater Lake National Park,"This place is so breathtakingly beautiful and what I would say is the closest to heaven you can get. The views are unbelievable! We were able to book a cabin down at Mazama Village which was only 7 miles from Rim Village (where the lodge, gift shop and other restaurant are). We went early July and the weather was perfect!The drive around the rim is a must, it's about 30 miles and will take awhile since the roads are pretty narrow. There are plenty of opportunities to stop at lookout points along the way that will give you stunning views of the lake, waterfalls and views outward at the mountains surrounding you.We weren't able to book the boat cruise tour but we did hike down to the waters edge and got to get in the lake. After paying the national park entrance price, there were no additional fees unless you want to book a tour. There is cliff jumping here, so I suggest bringing a change of clothes since the hike back up would not be fun soaking wet! The hike down was quick, only took about a half hour, but fair warning the hike up is tough for the ill prepared and non-athletic. There were a few people in our group that had a tough time with the combination of the altitude and the steep climbs. We were able to catch the sunset as well which was absolutely gorgeous, but fair warning, the mosquitos are worse than anything I've ever experienced! It is best watched from your car unless you want to be swatting like crazy, trust me from experience the pictures don't come out to well when you're flailing around. We also left some windows open so the people around us had quite the show to watch as we swatted mosquitos inside the car for a good 10 minutes!","August 14, 2014",UNREAL!

Crater Lake National Park,"We visited Crater Lake National Park. The lodge was full, so we could not stay overnight. We did take the trolley ride around the lake, 33 miles for 2 hours. The trolley had comfortable pads for sitting on, an excellent view on both sides, and a very clear PA system. The scenery was spectacular. There were several stops to get out of the trolley and take a photo. The guide was a national park ranger, who had a wealth of interesting information and some photos to pass around.There is a cafeteria with good food, but very expensive.Well worth the drive on the twisty mountain roads.","August 14, 2014",Beautiful place,3,,5
Crater Lake National Park,"I took a 3:30 standard boat tour with my family in Aug. 2014. I made a reservation a couple of weeks in advance. When you make reservation, don't bother to use on-line request. You need to call them. I called them to ask availability and them used the on-line reservation but didn't get any response even after about a week later. When I called them up, I was told all tours were sold out except 3:30 which was not my preference although it worked out better for us (I will write why later). They warned about hike. My kids and I don't think Cleetwood Cove Trail was that bad although my wife had a hard time in uphill. You need to take account for the time (about 30min down and an hour up). There is rocky area at the bottom of the trail where you can jump/dive into the water. Now for the standard boat tour (or Volcano Cruise). It was led by a ranger and very informative. You get to see many things including Wizard island and learn about the history. I can imagine it could get very hot 2 hours. You need to bring enough drinking water for the hike and the boat tour. Luckily, there was a thunderstorm coming which helped us stay relatively cool. Initially, they were concerned they might need to cancel the bout tour if the water gets bad. The captain took us clock-wise rather than their regular counter-clock wise route to get ahead of the storm. It paid off. By the time when we are back on the trail, we heard thunders. It was one of memorable activities we did. My naysayers changed their minds:-)","August 12, 2014",Cleetwood Cove Trail & standard volcano cruise,26,"Pleasanton, California",5
Crater Lake National Park,"What can you say about a park so lovely and well managed? Perfection. When Mt. Mazama blew its top some 7,700 years ago it's explosion was 50 times more powerful than that of Mt. St. Helens! It spread ash and lava so far it created its own eco-system, including at least two large lakes. Crater Lake itself is more than 2,000 feet deep. Say what? The sky is so blue, usually dotted with just enough clouds to make your photo Postcard perfect from a dozen angles. A trail runs around the entire circumference and provides more than enough aerobic opportunities. The Lodge is an experience in itself. The staff are friendly and competent. We had drinks on the lake-facing side...in rockers provided for that purpose. We'll return next year to stay a few nights at the Lodge, and we expect nothing but the same remarkable beauty, breathtaking scenery and perfection in nature.

They have a ferry boat to take passengers over to the island. It has extremely steep sides and overlooks. There was one place they were doing some road work but it was only minor otherwise the roads are well paved. They have a small ""village shops"" and nice well maintained restrooms. Would really enjoy returning to visit and again. ","August 11, 2014",Absolutely beautiful and very enjoyable!,127,,5
Crater Lake National Park,"During our West Coast National Park Road Trip, Crater Lake was one of the parks which I am very glad we visited. It is a very beautiful and unique place - unlike any other park I have visited in the US. At a minimum take the Rim Drive, stopping at each lookout point for very nice views and photos. But to really appreciate the lake, take one of the boat tours to see the bluest water ever. You can see the bottom 40 -60 feet below you which is simply unforgettable. The NP tour guide was very informative, friendly and helpful.Cleetwood Cove trail is the only way down to the lake, but regardless of what you heard, it is a very doable hike. My wife and I are in our 50's and in average shape. We made it down to the bottom in about 30 minutes. They say allow 1 hour minimum for the hike back up, but we easily made it in less than an hour - simply take advantage of shady spots for a 2-4 minute rest after every few switchbacks.","August 11, 2014",Should be a Must Visit Park,83,"Monroeville, Pennsylvania",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake NP was one of the places that I always wanted to visit and finally did this summer. The park is fairly remote from most major cities but is well worth the drive. The view is absolutely amazing. We were fortunate to get two different perspectives on the lake - Day 1, the clouds were rolling in and the weather was cold and dreary. You could not see Wizard Island from the boat dock. Not a pleasant day - the temp got down to freezing in mid-July. Day 2- complete change of the weather - sky was crystal clear and the water color was truly amazing - blue as blue can be. We were lucky to take the boat tour on day 2 - made the walk down on day 1 but the boat trip got cancelled due to the weather. Highly recommend the boat tour. It gives you a totally different perspective compared to looking down from the top. The rim drive was good too. There are plenty of hikes to keep you busy - we were there for only 3 days which didn't seem like enough time since the weather was pretty bad on the first day. If you get time - go see the pinnacles....really neat. There is a trail the goes beyond the park boundary but we didn't have a map and were short on time but would have liked to follow it to see if it leads to anything.Stay at the lodge if all possible - super convenient and you can't beat the location. The back deck is great for evening views.Other than the lodge - everything is relatively far and driving times are longer than you would expect due to the twisty roads and conditions.Would definitely like to go back to hike to the top of Mt Scott.","August 10, 2014",Without a doubt - Beautiful place to visit!,139,"Houston, Texas",5

Crater Lake National Park,"We rode up from Klamath Falls and about a mile into the park on a right hand turn, was about an Inch of gravel all over the road for resurfacing. No warning signs, no nothing. I had to straighten up into the left lane to keep from sliding out. At the N.P. gate I told the attendant, that they are going to get someone killed, and it was almost us. All he said was that we should fill out a ""Comment Card"" at the Visitor's Center. I later complained to a Park Ranger in a much louder tone and they finally sent someone down to put up warning signs in the right place. Also, there is only one gas pump at Mazama Village and it has only Regular Unleaded. If you need Premium for your motorcycle you are S.O.L.

Crater Lake National Park,Crater Lake is one of the most beautiful places on the West coast and a place everyone should see at least once. Stay at the Lodge and watch the sunset sitting on rocking chairs on the patio with a glass of wine or a local beer. The lodge is above the lake (about 6500 ft.) and the views are spectacular. Get up early and watch the sunrise. Accommodations at the lodge are very good but hard to book due to the short season so book now for next year.I found the food in the main restaurant in the Lodge to be expensive and most people who ate there were not impressed. I only had breakfast in the restaurant and that was very good. The trick is to eat off the appetizer menu in the lobby and bring your own wine (staff will provide the classes).

We drove around the entire lake stopping @ different look out points & spent about an hour @ the visitors center/ museum/lookout where there were a couple activities for the kids to do to become Crater Lake Jr. Rangers. We also took the hike down to the water which took about 30 mins with a couple quick stops to enjoy the view, & 30 mins back up with stops to catch our breath :) it was a bit rough on the way back up the Mt. but definitely worth it. It was a beautiful day & an unforgettable adventure.","August 6, 2014",Absolutely Amazing!,2,,5
Crater Lake National Park,"One of the beauties of Crater Lake is it's isolation from modern civilization. The surrounding forests have not been touched since they were inhabited by native Americans hundreds of years ago. The lake itself, formed by an erupting volcano which then colapsed in upon itself forming a round lake, is filled with pure water from rain and snow melt. No streams feed it or flow out from it. It maintains it's water level through evaporation. The hike down to the surface of the lake, is a one mile switch-back perpendicular hike. The hike back up, they joke, is 10 miles! It is worth the effort. The National Park Service runs a few ecologically responsible boat rides, which show off the lake from a unique perspective. The water is an unusually vibrant blue. The lodge has been renovated, but has kept it's historical charm. The restuarant in the lodge serves amazing food. There is a trolly ride around the rim of the crater which is also worthwile. A Ranger gives a great informational talk en route, and there are several stops for pictures. It is quite a treck to get to Crater Lake, and you can see everything in a day, especially if you make reservations for the boat ride before arriving.","August 6, 2014",Gorgeous Geological National Treasure,83,"Boise, Idaho",4

It wasn't too hot so we parked in the shade, opened the sun roof and cracked the windows and filled up a big bowl of water for the dogs. They stayed in the car while we went into the visitors centers and watched a ~20 minute video about the origins of Crater Lake. The video starts at 00 and 30 on each hour. It was definitely worth the time. Then we drove up to the lake and stopped at ~10 look outs. The dogs got out at each look out with us. There were a lot of dogs at the various look outs. We got out, took pictures and enjoyed the scenery. The lake is so blue and it really makes an impact on you.

Crater Lake National Park,"Absolutely beautiful! The Rim Village was very crowded when we visited, so opted to take the Garfield Peak hike (trailhead is just past the lodge). Very strenuous hike, with a constant uphill, but there are countless viewpoints of the lake that are breathtaking. It is worth it to keep going to the very top, a phenomenal panorama of the lake and surrounding mountains awaits. Phantom Ship is completely visible, excellent views of Wizard Island, Diamond Lake, Mt. Bailey, and Mt. Thielsen in one direction, Klamath Lake and Mt. Shasta in the other. Bring binoculars, a camera, lots of water, and a picnic lunch or snacks, we enjoyed sitting at the summit under some shady trees for a bit in order to take in the views. We traveled as a group, some who had never seen Crater Lake before, others who had already been--it was unanimously the best hike and best view of Crater Lake any of us had ever seen.

Crater Lake National Park,"It a worthwhile trip to experience the deepest, most pristine (fed only by snow, rain & fog) and beautiful lake born from a volcanic explosion. And Wizard Island in the lake is an active, sleeping volcano!And it's also worth the time to go online in advance and do research before you get there. There is so much to see and do, that it helps to know what your options are. I could have done so much more in my marathon day trip if I had scheduled my time better and bought some tickets in advance. I missed the rim trolly ride or boat ride and several ranger talks/walks because they were sold out or I didn't plan my ""route"" to include them.The Crater Lake ""reflections"" park newspaper has the best current information on all that is available. It's available online and they also give you one at the entry gate. (but I didn't read mine until later).Watching the 22 minute video on the formation of the lake and seen only at the Steel Visitor Center (about 15 mi into the park), viewing the Crater from various areas around the rim (2-3 hrs for stops) and taking advantage of ranger lead talks,walks, boat or trolley tours and kids programs is a must. Planning is key because everything sells out or fills quickly in the summer. And the above doesn't even include allowing time to do any of the many scenic hikes and to tour or have lunch at the restored, historic Lodge.It would be ideal to spend several days there. However the lodge books well in advance. It was sold out for the entire season with only 3 nights in October when I checked in mid-July. Being an optimist, I even took an overnight bag on Sunday and ask about a cancellation due to lightning fires and road closures, but no luck.Be sure to use your senior pass ($10 for lifetime @ 62) for free admission or consider getting one of the other passes if you visit the national parks, monuments, etc.And finally, the journey to or from Crater Lake along scenic Hwy 138 is a trip in itself. The twisty highway snakes along the Umpqua River enveloping you in the sights, sounds & smells of the river, waterfalls, towering trees and sheer rock walls.Nearby Diamond Lake is a gorgeous, bright blue and a family friendly place with swimming, fishing, boating, paddle boat rentals and more that you can't do on Crater Lake. The lodge is quite old and rundown, but the camping areas look pretty good and some sights have a view of the lake.Farther west along the highway, there are several state and national campgrounds suitable for tents or small campers. Several of these have a spectacular waterfall with picnic tables that are easily accessible from the highway that make for an enjoyable stop. Most have bathrooms, but bring TP hand sanitizer.And finally, be sure to see the Colliding Rivers near the town of Glide. It's the only place in the world where two Rivers collide head-on.

This is one of the most beautiful lakes I have seen -- surrounded by mountains.Crater Lake was formed when a volcano imploded and formed a caldera. Wizard Island (in the middle of Crater Lake) was formed by later volcanic activity. One of the most interesting things is that there are no rivers or streams that feed the lake. The evaporation is replaced by rain and snowfall. Truly amazing. Take the time to sit at the lodge, have a snack, and enjoy the view.I recommend that you go to the visitors center and watch the great video showing how the lake formed. It has an interactive portion which is great for kids! The rangers are accessible and friendly. Take the rim drive and enjoy the lake from all angles.

The gorgeous blue waters hundreds of feet below and the snow covered mountains hundreds of feet above you are incredible. Even though it was 70 degrees outside, there were a considerable amount of snow drifts left. The lake was actually formed when the original volcano imploded upon itself. An island was formed when the volcano ""regrew"". The lake is almost 2,000 feet deep and you can see nearly 200 feet down. The only bad thing about the park is the mosquitoes. They are massive and bite through your clothing. The weird thing about them is that their bites didn't itch at all afterwards, but were painful when you are bitten. Were it not for the mosquitoes we would have spent another hour or so at the park.

If you can go during the week, you will avoid some of the crowding that occurs on weekends. Lunch is possible at the cafe in Rim Village. The visitor center has a good movie that orients you to the unique character of the lake environment and stresses the purity of the water. On a clear day, the color of the lake is so blue that it seems like something created for a film. The viewpoints are a must to stop at, to see the lake and Wizard Island from multiple angles and viewpoints. Other mountains in the Cascades are visible in the distance on clear days, giving you a sense of what the mountain looked like before the eruption that caused the creation of the lake.","July 31, 2014","Beautiful, unique, natural site",7,"Fairbanks, Alaska",5

Crater Lake National Park,"We've visited most of the National Parks in the West and would definitely put this in the top 10. Rim drive is beautiful (we were there on a lovely 80 degree, clear sky, light breeze day). Visited the Lake Lodge (think smaller version of the Yellowstone Lodge) sat out on the deck in the rocking chairs and enjoyed a couple of cold beverages as we took in the lake veiw.As with many National Parks, it was very crowded. You have to be a little patient in just about everything (parking, getting a rocking chair at the lodge, buying a souvenir, etc.). Actually, parking was very difficult up near the lodge area. Granted, we are in an RV so we know it will be tough to find a place to park but we watched cars lap around and around waiting for someone to pull out in order to park. Suggest heading down the North road about a quarter mile and using the large lot off the rim road then hiking back up the the lodge area.Not a whole lot to do there besides looking at and reading about the lake -- a couple of good hikes down to the lake (not easy) or you can take a boat tour of the lake (we didn't). I would put this into the category of a good 1/2 day adventure.","July 30, 2014",Absolutely Beautiful -- parking is hellish,78,"Richland, Washington",4
Crater Lake National Park,"It's hard to beat the spectacular beauty of this place...especially when 'conditions' are just right: on a cloudless, sunny day without a breeze, the lake looks like a mirror, reflecting the surrounding rim so perfectly, it's hard to tell where one ends and the other begins! The rim road around the crater offers new and different views from every angle, all stunningly beautiful. Although only open from June to October (depending on the weather), the fabulous Crater Lake Lodge is a delightful place to stay, but if you can't manage a room there, at least try to enjoy a meal there. They don't take reservations (first come, first served), but show up early if you hope to secure a table by the window. There is also a day lodge that is open year round, for quick bites and gift shop. The park information center has a display on the geological history of the dormant volcano and lake that is not to be missed...very interesting! Once the snows start falling the north entrance road will close, but you can still access through the south entrance road through the winter, but I think July and August are the best times to visit.","July 30, 2014",Oregon's (only) National Park is Spectacular!,58,"Roseburg, Oregon",5

Crater Lake National Park,"Nature has a way of being both destructive and creative at the same time and Crater lake is one of those events. Around 7700 years ago Mount Mazama (?) erupted leaving a massive crater that, over the years, has filled with rain and snow-melt to form the deepest and purest lake in the USA. It is one of those sights that really does 'take my breath away'. We drove the entire rim. shopping occasionally for what the Americans call a 'vista point' and also for a wonderful picnic stop. The photos look like I've been at the 'Photoshop' tools but they are all real, down to the buzzard perched atop a dead tree.Unlike many of America's attractions this one has no gizmos, no pressure - it is truly wonderful.","July 29, 2014",Bluer than blue,38,"Tarporley, United Kingdom",5

Crater Lake National Park,"We did a road trip from Seattle to Washington, including a couple of national parks. Crater Lake was the first. We actually camped here. We arrived about 11 and started to set up camp, we were being attacked by mosquitoes! So as my husband set up camp, I went to the general store and bought $10 bug spray. WELL WORTH IT! After that we traveled up the mountain. It was absolutely beautiful! There was still snow on the ground so it was cool. We hiked up Garfield Peak. It was pretty steep, but worth it. there were kids and families hiking as well. We stopped at the bowl and the lake was breathtaking! The remainder of the hike was snow covered and since we spent the day before in Mount Rainier doing snow hikes, we opted to stop here. We then returned to our car and drove to Cleetwood cove where we hiked down to the lake. This was an EXTREMELY steep hike. On the way down, we passed a man heading up. He was leaning against a tree and told us, ""Be glad you're not fat"". We kind of laughed it off. We got to the water and it was amazing. The water is very cold, but my husband felt the need (along with a couple others) to take the plunge. I mean, it is cool to say you have swam (or in his case, jumped in and out) of the deepest lake in the USA. We started the hike back up and actually passed the poor guy we passed earlier on the way down.I highly recommend this hike if you are physically able. Up is NOT easy!There were no mosquitoes the entire time we were hiking.Back at the campsite they were back! The site offers free firewood which was very nice!

There are many stops to take photos and you dont have to do special hikes to get the full experience.Suggestions:- Bring a substantial picnic as there are good rest stops that you can sit down at and chill out.

Wish we had done it years ago - but, that being said, we now have those photos imprinted in our minds (not to mention all the digital photos that we took). You can drive around the entire lake, about 26 miles, in about 2 or 3 hours depending on how many stops you make to just take in the sight! Recommend you stop at the Visitors Center prior to starting your drive around the lake. They have some nice souvenirs and also a free map showing all the important overlook stops. The lake is about an hours drive from Shady Cove, Oregon. Recommend a stop at a trail that runs along the Rogue River.

We entered from the north and we thought the first couple of lookouts going counterclockwise were the best. We hit a perfect day at the end of June when the temperature was about 80 but there was still much snow right along the roads. This is one place we really would like to return to and have more time to spend. One day is not enough and even though our many, many photos look unreal they really do not do justice.

We enjoyed the hiking (We did the Cleetwood Cove Trail with some misgivings, but were able to do it with pacing ourselves. Rangers say they rescue at least one person per day in the summer due to overexertion or dehydration- so prepare yourself!). We were surprised to still find half of the rim closed to traffic due to snow as it was the last week of June. The boat tours also didn't start until the following week. The Lodge was a wonderful place to have lunch with delicious fare, excellent service and an amazing view of the lake. We knew the water was clean when the staff on the research boat filled their canteens directly from the lake and drank it!

Crater Lake National Park,"We started our visit at the Steel Visitor Center at the South entrance. The short 20-min. movie showing how the crater was created was informative and worth the time. We also hiked the trail from the visitor center to the wildflower trail: I think it was about 1 1/2 - 2 miles round trip from the visitor center parking lot. It was a nice, quick hike through the woods, with pretty wildflower and a tumbling stream: LOTS of mosquitoes, though, so it would be smart to spray on some ""Off"" if you're walking the trail. We didn't see any mosquitoes anywhere else, however. We then drove the west rim, stopping at lookouts for the beautiful views. The wildfire smoke was creating a haze that hampered viewing somewhat: our kids were disappointed they couldn't see the clear blue of the water very well. We hiked the steep trail down to the water surface: it's worth doing for the experience and the memory, as long as you're in decent shape.

There are a number of ways to view the lake when visiting the National Park and I suggest taking advantage of as many of them as time allows on your visit. The trek down to the lake (and back up to the rim) is worth it, for sure. Taking a drive along the rim offers numerous places to stop off for photo opportunities and to just enjoy the lake from a different perspective. I wish the boat trips were more affordable for families, though. That seems to be a theme in the National Parks lately.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake has amazing views of the clear water and sheer cliffs from many spots along the Rim Drive; however, you should also venture off Rim Drive to see the wildflowers, falls, and other part of this national park. Here are my tips for a visit:- Walk to the highest point of Discovery Point Trail; it isn't that much of a climb and you get even better views of Wizard Island.- Sun Notch Trail has better views of Phantom Ship than the Phantom Ship Overlook (and it isn't that much of a hike)- The boat tours (which are well worth it) leave from Cleetwood Cove Trail which is pretty far from any place to get food. So, pack a picnic lunch and have lunch at the picnic area near Cloudcap Overlook. The picnic tables are in the shade and offer some nice views (especially of Mount Scott, the highest point in the park).- Stop by the Crater Lake Lodge and sit for a bit in the rocking chairs they have outside on the balcony; it might be crowded but the chairs generally become free quickly (our party of 4 were able to find seats both afternoons we stopped here). The view is great and it is shady in the afternoon.- Castle Crest Trail offers some great views of wildflowers but bring bug spray; it was the only part of the park where we needed it.- Only walk half way on the Pinnacles Trail from the Pinnacles Overlook. The view of the Pinnacles doesn't get any better past that point.- The Plaikni Falls hike is well worth it.

Crater Lake National Park,"Its a lake with deep blue water and formed by a crater, so what can be so unique? The first thing that will take your breath away is the deep blue water. Once you start getting to know that the lake formed by collapse of Mount Mazama and is over 150 years old, your interest would be piqued. Take an auto tour around the rim of the lake, stop at various scenic point (each view is different from the rest), attempt panoramic pictures (only to be frustrated, what you see can't be captured). By now, you are clearly drawn to the lake and its allure, still your rational mind makes you think its a lake, no big deal. Consider this...the lake has neither inlets nor outlets, all the water is filled by precipitation and snowfalls, melts. This makes it one of the most purest, freshest and palatable waters in the whole world, simply scoop and drink. If all of this still doesn't convince you, camp out at the Mazama Campground, ponder this over and head to a conducted boat tour early next morning. Tickets are first come first serve, so suggest being there at 7, I think the tour was at 830. There is a steep 1 mile hike down to the lake, fun begins when you finish the tour :) The trip also has an optional stop and hike at Mount Washington, its a small island in the lake. The views from the top of it are out of the ordinary and not every passing tourist gets to experience it, the hike intensity is moderate and would be worth every ounce of energy you spend. If you are still unconvinced, I suggest you stop by, check it out and write to me :)","July 11, 2014","The Magnificence can't be captured on a picture, experience it instead!",61,"San Antonio, Texas",5
Crater Lake National Park,"While I figured that I would enjoy my sojourn to Crater Lake, as I do all national parks, I was immediately impressed by the natural beauty of the area. The lake itself seemed so much larger in person, and the blue color is just an incredible sight to behold. I only approximated roughly 4 hours for this stop on my trip, and in retrospect it was a mistake. I took the advice of some who stated that one does not need much time to view the lake and take in what there is to experience there. Well, lesson learned, and I will spend significantly more time at Crater Lake in the future. Perhaps a more thorough drive around shall suffice. Till next time...On a negative note, the park was flooded with Indians (non Native American) on this particular 4th of July, and while that is not particularly noteworthy, the fact that many of them used the park for a dumpsite is. I find it abhorrent that I had to witness such disregard and carelessness over and over. An American National Park is not a garbage dump for you and your family to trash!","July 10, 2014",An Unexpected Surprise,17,"Los Angeles, California",5

Crater Lake National Park,"WOW! This place is absolutely incredible! We were only able to drive half of the rim road due to snow and falling rocks on the other half. What we did see was amazing! If you have time (and I really hope you do!), purchase tickets for the boat ride to wizard island. Buy your tickets well in advance, there are not many tickets available. The half day tour is just the right amount of time. The hike down to the boat is VERY steep, but you will be well -rewarded at the bottom. We hiked to the summit, into the bowl of the crater, grabbed a quick snack, hiked back down, then hiked over (CRAZY sharp and unstable lava rocks) to the west side of the island, took a VERY quick dip in the bay (COLD), and made it back to the boat with a few minutes to spare. SO worth it!","July 9, 2014",OMG- blue like you have never seen,75,"Durham, North Carolina",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We took a scenic back road out of Klamath Falls to reach the site and given our early morning travel it provided for some breathtaking views of the lake, its surrounding pasture lands and mountain ranges. Crater Lake is simply an amazing sight to see. We drove the whole rim route stopping at the various overlooks for both shots of the lake as well as the surrounding valleys/mountain peaks. We had intended to hike the 1.6 mile trail up to the Watchman's Tower but due to the heavy ice still laying about it was closed. We did find that the Mt. Scott trail on the opposite side (2.5 miles) was open. It was a wonderful way to spend the day.

Crater Lake National Park,"The lake is beautiful which definitely justifies the trip of 400+ miles. However, it was not as stunning as expected, probably due to the high expectation. There are two things to point out for future visitors. First, please be aware that the side AWAY from the lake has many cliffs while the one CLOSE to the lake does not. Therefore driving close-wise on the rim drive is BOTH safer and easier to access the many view points. Unfortunately, many posts that I read here before the trip were misleading which caused us to actually drive counter clock-wise on the rim. Again, remember that the cliffs are on the side that is AWAY from the lake. Second, the mosquito was HORRIBLE after 5:30pm, even under strong wind on top of the hill. We have to skip many view points as we didn't want to carry tons of mosquitos back home. Our visit was on July 4 when it was still very bright at 6pm but mosquitos already couldn't wait.","July 6, 2014",Worth the trip,11,"Bellevue, Washington",4

Crater Lake National Park,"The drive here was pretty easy from Eugene as we made a day trip of it. Stopped along the way at a Subway and brought a picnic lunch with us. So glad we did because the line in the rim village cafe (only place to get food in park) was out the door. And it didn't look all that good. Our big disappointment was that the East Rim Drive was closed about 2 miles in, so the Rim Loop couldn't be completed. This was just last week so I would check in advance before heading out to make sure it's open. Just not as much fun when you can't do the loop. The lake itself is spectacular, though, and the color is more beautiful than any lake I have ever seen. It's obvious they have a lot of rock slides along the sides and perhaps this is why the road is closed? Either that or snow, yes, there was still snow around the lake. Definitely worth the visit and an easy trip from Portland or Eugene. Cost to get into the park is a very reasonable $10 per car and lots of good hiking options if you want to spend more time there.

It was formed over 7,500 years ago when a volcano eruption and explosion caused to top of the volcano to collapse within itself and filled with water from rain and snow fall.There is a roadway that circles the lake so you can view the lake from all angles. The richness of the dark blue water is second to none, only Lake Tahoe could come close. There is a lodge at the edge of the lake with a great gift shop and restaurant. There was still snow on the ground in areas which added to the beauty.

Crater Lake National Park,"I've been wanting to go to Crater Lake for awhile now, since I moved up here to Bremerton Washington last fall, and I finally decided to make the long drive out there this past weekend. I drove in the middle of the night to get there just before sunrise. My plan was to headlamp hike in the dark to a good point on the Watchman trail, and then take tons of pictures (I'm an avid photographer) of the sunrise. I got there in time as planned, but the Watchman trail was closed! I started heading up it anyway, but shortly realized while it was still closed...lots of snow...Luckily, the parking lot for the trail was an amazing observation point in of itself. There were just enough clouds to make for a vivid and colorful sunrise that lasted for a good hour or so. I quickly drove from turnout to turnout in order to capture a variety of sunrise pictures. I took almost a thousand pictures during the 12 hours that I was there, many being relatively the same, but the Lake is just so wonderful... Half of the trails were still closed, but should be opening up for July 4th weekend. I was able to do the Godfrey's Glen trail (no views of the Lake, but still interesting), the Castle Wildflower Trail (unfortunately no wildflowers yet), a mile of Garfield Peak (the rest was still closed due to snow), and my favorite one, Cleetwood Cove Trail, which is the one that takes you down to water level, and has the optional boat tour July-September. While at the bottom of the trail, I, along with several other people who seemed to be in their early 20s, jumped off of a rock ledge into the water, which was a lot of fun. However, the water is quite freezing, so if you want to do this, bring a towel or just suck it up. Some ladies were actually sunbathing on the rocks by the Lake, and they seemed to be enjoying themselves. Anyway, the Rim Road around the Lake is also partially open and closed seasonally, so check the NPS website for the latest conditions. The East Rim was closed east of Cleetwood Cove Trail while I was there, as part of a special weekend event for cyclists only. However, there are so many observation points all over the road anyway, with excellent views of the wonderfully blue and clear lake that I wasn't too disappointed. Coming there, I knew that various things would still be closed. I recommend going no earlier than July, if you have that option. If you're looking for somewhere cheaper but still close to sleep, I enjoyed my stay at the Budget Inn Motel in Chemult, which was $52, and I ate some food at Annie's in the Southern part of Crater Lake N.P. The cost of the park is $10 for a week pass I think.Tips: -Bring good insect repellant! The mosquitoes are ridiculous.-Bring your fully charged camera-Have a picnic somewhere in the Park (I enjoyed watching the birds at Grouse Hill)-Stop in at the Visitor's Center or call in advance for trail conditions and closings.-Bring clothes that you wouldn't mind getting wet in, so you can jump into the lake-Bring some food and water, because Crater Lake Lodge is verrrryyy pricey. -Fill up on gas before you get near the park.-Do the Cleetwood Cove Trail, unless you're not able to do a moderately steep trail at all.-See the sunrise from the Watchman Observation Point.-If you're not hiking, spend most of a day here. If you're doing just some shorter hikes, spend a full day here. If you're looking to do some of the longer hikes, like some of the Mountain trails, and really explore the area, spend 2-3 days here. Don't expect to spend an entire week here though, and don't plan for only a couple hours.I posted several photos as well","June 25, 2014","Magnificent, wonderful, and glorious.",66,"Bremerton, Washington",5

Crater Lake National Park,"My sister and I decided, on a whim, to check out Crater Lake National Park on our epic road trip from Victoria to Las Vegas and back. It was our second day on the road, leaving with Voodoo Doughnuts in hand from Eugene, and heading southwest to Reno. A quick detour off the route and we slipped into the park, paying the ten bucks to get in at the north gate.We headed south along the park, the woods thick, the blue sky a nice change from the last day and a half. It was one of those cool, crisp fall days, the sort of reason I love taking September holidays. There were a few clouds in the sky, but nothing to worry about. We drove through the trees, then suddenly out into a small desert. The Pumice Desert is quite stunning; most pictures are of the lake, but the view over this sandy zone is gorgeous as well, and we pulled over to look at the nearby vistas and gawk at the mountains.We continued sound, and the first glimpses of the lake came into view. We pulled into the parking lot (busy, but not overflowing, thank goodness it was a midweek school day) and got out to stretch our legs. We walked up the hill to the lookout and I remember saying 'Wow...' We spent half an hour standing around and looking, listening to the chirp of insects. The water is amazingly clear, the descent into the lake steep, and everything seems eternal. There's no wonder it was considered a place a power by the Native Americans.We stopped at a couple of other spots on the west rim to get different looks, taking pictures and enjoying the day. Then south to the visitor's centre. We looked in at the restaurant and gift shop. The first was a bit expensive, so we decided to hold off until the next town, but we did pick up some mementos. I found a nice sweater, and liked it enough was willing to pay the tourist trap mark-up for it, but we picked up some postcards and little things, then south out of the park towards our hotel in Reno. We wished we could have stayed and explored more.","March 24, 2014",Breathtaking,24,"Prince Rupert, Canada",5

The crowds are moderate most of the time especially in winter when you will almost have the place to yourself. With an average annual snowfall of 42 FEET it is a wonderful place for cross country skiing or snowshoeing, or if you are adventurous - snow caving.

Crater Lake National Park,"We spent a day in the crater lake national park. There is a trolley tour which runs throughout the day , the last one leaving at 4 pm (not sure). we roamed around the lake taking pictures and enjoying the beauty. We had lunch at the Crater Lake lodge Dining Room. The chicken sandwich was very tasty but the it is a little expensive. We took the trolley ride at 1:30 and the ride lasted for 2 hours (30 mins buffer) . Our guide was very well informed and had been working there for several years. It was very informative tour around the lake. They stop at several location and give you a chance to take pics. It was a good way of going around the rim without having the hassle of driving. Then we hiked down to the lake itself. It was a steep hike but manageable. I would recommend taking the ferry ride from the bottom of the lake.

Crater Lake National Park,"You know I had seen many pictures of Crater Lake before going and while I thought it looked nice, it didn't seem worth going out of your way for. We were going to Oregon and I figured we had to go. We got incredibly lucky, as it hard to get a clear day for an unimpeded view of the lake and when we got there the view was perfect. All I can say is, no picture, no matter how good, can do it justice. It is really beautiful. We couldn't stay more than an hour, as my mother had experienced altitude sickness on the trip. And while I could have tarried longer, we had enough time to check it out from a number of vista points and appreciate how extraordinary it is. I don't know if it is unique in the world, but I haven't seen anything remotely like it, lakes yes, but not in this setting. It's lovely and if you are going to Oregon, you would be crazy not to go. The one recommendation I would make is to have a flexible schedule so you can go there when the weather is right. It would be a shame not to see it on a clear day.","February 10, 2014","I agree, wow",245,Virginia,5

Crater Lake National Park,"let me just start with saying what an experience! this lake is amazing, and I really didn'e expect it to be so special. we arrived from the south through Hwy 62 with a great view on September. we first stopped at the Godfrey glen trail which is a short and easy 30 minutes loop trail that brings you to a great view of the pinnacles phenomenon. if you arrive later on the season you can see more water flows in between. then we continued to the actual lake and of course stopped at the village first for the first glimpse of the lake. we wanted to take the discovery trail but couldn't find the start point and the lines at the visitor center were so long that we just continued to the next point in the lake. it was a good decision because we saw so much of the lake later on, and it didn't feel like i missed something. check the interactive signs outside the village on the sidewalk that explain a little bit about the lake and how it was created before you start circling it. from the visitor center we continued for our first real hike of the day- the watchman peak. it is a great observation point (closest to the smaller island on the lake) but also the start of a 1.5 mile round trip steep hike to an even better lookout of the lake. at the top there is the watch point for fires, and you can see far far away. then we continued to cleetwood cove which is the only point you can go down to the shore and swim. the way down is easy bur consider you need to walk all the way up... there are few benches you can rest on the way, and it is doable, but takes time even for the stronger of us. the water are freezing even in September, but it was one of those things that you have to do... we continued circling the lake with a lot of stopping points and reached the phantom ship point with its small island. we drove outside the park through pinnacle road to another great view of huge pinnacles from the old lava burst it was a great long day but well worth the drive!","January 29, 2014",like a postcard!,239,"Israel, Jerusalem",5

This time the lake was partially frozen because of the cold weather... there was much more snow and the rim drive was closed. Couple of tips:Choose the weather carefully before you go. If it is cloudy, the lake view isn't as amazing... since it is not clear and blue...The roads surrounding the lake are steep and narrow...It is almost always cold because of the elevation... there is almost always some snow there...","January 20, 2014",Amazing and the most unique lake,97,"San Jose, California",5

Crater Lake National Park,"The boat tour is the absolute best way to see Crater Lake. It's only available during the summer months (end of June to mid September), but if you visit the park during that time, the boat tour is fantastic. The tour does require hiking down the Cleetwood Cove Trail, however (see my review of this trail). Losing and then gaining 700 feet of elevation as you descend to the dock and then hike back up to the parking lot, this trail is strenuous and is not for people who aren't in good shape. Once down the trail, the boat departs from the dock at the end of Cleetwood Cove Trail and goes around the lake in the counterclockwise direction. About half way through, the boat stops at Wizard Island, and you can also do a tour of the volcanic island and stay here for about three hours. I wrote a separate review for Wizard Island. From Wizard Island, the boat finishes up the loop around the perimeter of the lake. A park ranger accompanies the tour and talks about the cultural and natural history of the lake. Many of the features seen from the boat cannot be seen from the rim or can only be seen from a distance. Some of the things you can see from boat include: Llao Rock, named for the Klamath god of the underworld; Devil's Backbone, a rock formation that looks surprisingly like a spine; Wizard Island; Chaski Bay with a couple of waterfalls that can only be seen from lake level; Phantom Ship up close. I think this was my favorite thing on the tour. Seeing it from the rim, it looks so small. From the boat doing a quick loop around the island, I realized how big the island really is. And it still looks like a mysterious ship; Pumice Castle, a bright orange rock formation in the shape of a castle; Palisades, brightly colored cliffs; and Old Man of the Lake, a vertically bobbing tree trunk that has been in the lake for more than a century.","December 26, 2013",Crater Lake Boat Tour,1031,"Raleigh, North Carolina",5

Crater Lake National Park,"The summer is short at Crater Lake National Park, but the wildflowers are stunning. The snow-free season is roughly July to mid October. Based upon several visits to the park, the wildflowers peak around the end of July and early August. If you are flying in, book into the Klamath Falls airport and rent a car there. It's about 50 miles to the park and it's incredibly scenic all the way. If driving, your choices are the north entrance or the south entrance. I recommend the south entrance so you can make your first stop at the Steel Visitor Center to pick up a wildflower brochure or book. You can also wander up the road that is between the visitor center and the admin until you see the Lady of the Woods trail. The trail crosses the road a little ways past the administration building – take it to your right. Follow the trail up the creek to the wildflowers. Your next stop should be the Castle Crest Wildflower Garden where a short trail will lead you through the beautiful flowers and a brochure will tell you all about them. Annie Creek Trail, near the south entrance, and Sun Meadow, on Rim Drive east of Castle Crest, also offer great wildflower displays. For more info, Google ""crater lake wildflowers."" There are lots of web pages on the topic, but be sure to check out the link to ""Crater Lake Wildflowers | Explore!"" for a story, a slide-show of photos and a video of Castle Crest.","November 25, 2013",Stunning Wildflowers,2,Klamath Falls,5
Crater Lake National Park,"because the first day was miserable. We drove in from the north entrance, which was totally fogged in past the pumice desert. Spent the night at Crater Lake Lodge. Woke to fog. We had to take it on faith that there was a lake down there somewhere. We walked close to the hotel and went to the Sinott Memorial Overlook in drizzling rain and fog. I worked on my photos in the hotel room and we enjoyed the Lodge lobby that evening, with a Ranger talk. Next day dawned (???) foggy. There are trolley tours of the Rim Drive available, and I knew that if my husband was going to be able to enjoy the park at all, without having to watch the driving, this would be a good choice. In a fit of outrageous optimism we bought tickets for the noon tour, thinking we must be total fools. There were 5 other outrageous optimists with us on the trolley, and a wonderful driver and park ranger. We thought we were going to be told all about things we could not see. But at the first overlook the fog began to lift. We could see water!! It only got better from there---never the clear blue sky that you see in calendar pictures, but a wonderful view of the lake. Since there were only seven of us the trolley we made a stop that is not usually on the tour: Cloudcap Overlook. There was plenty of time to get off at each stop and take pictures, since we were not exactly a crowd. I am so glad we did this! When we returned to the Lodge we hiked a bit up Garfield Peak Trail. By the time we returned to the Lodge the rockers on the verandah were dried out enough to sit out with a glass of wine and enjoy the view before dinner.Next morning at breakfast it had begun to snow. And stick. Since we were going back out the north entrance we decided to get out of there as fast as possible. (We're from Alabama. We don't do snow). By the time we had packed, loaded and checked out the snow was really coming down. I got some great video!

Crater Lake National Park,"The signage for the trails could be a little better, but overall, this was a great place to go hiking. The #1 must-do trail is the Cleetwood Cove. It's the only trail that goes down to the water's edge. True, it's steep and arduous. But it's so worth it! The trail takes about 1.5 hours roundtrip at a decent pace with a few minutes to use the pit toilets and enjoy the scenery at the bottom. TAKE LOTS OF WATER!! There's no drinking water at the bottom, and the return trip is grueling in the summer heat. Sun Notch is my #2 choice. It's a quick 30-minute loop that lets you look over the rim to see the Phantom Ship below. The Pinnacles is a good trail, but you pretty much see it all in the first 15 minutes. Unless you're really looking for a long hike, turn around and head back once you've seen the Pinnacles (they're the only reason the trail exists, right?). Godfrey Glen is okay, but it's poorly marked, and once again, all the good stuff is right at the beginning. Do a 30-minute roundtrip, tops. Plaikini Falls aren't that spectacular. The hour-long hike isn't worth it. Discovery Point and Watchmen Peak are so poorly marked, I'm not sure which trail I actually hiked.

I remembered how nice it was then but no picture or travel writer can do this place justice. You just have to go there and see for yourself. Make sure you go on a boat tour (season just ended 9/15) as well as along the rim. It is also a good idea to catch the crater in different light such as sunrise and sunset as it makes it that much more incredible.

Crater Lake National Park,Crater Lake is a must see if you are going to Oregon. A lot of people apparently only drive on the western part of the rim drive because we found the eastern side not as busy. You should definitely drive the whole rim road because Crater Lake was beautiful from every stop along the way. We went in early September intentionally to miss the big summer crowds yet to be there before snow closed the rim road. The blue of the lake is amazing as are the surrounding mountains. We wanted to take sunset pictures so we went to the Watchman overlook an hour before sunset and watched as the light changed the colors of the mountains and lake. My husband is into astrophotography so we stayed until well after dark so he could take night sky pictures. The sky was amazingly dark with the Milky Way clearly visible.

We drove around the lake and did plenty of sightseeing and picture taking. However, due to snow we were not able to completely drive the full circle. The lake was picture perfect. It was serene and breathtaking.","October 5, 2013",Breathtaking...,26,"Camas, Washington",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We took the trolley ride around the lake. A must do! The Park Guide gives so much information! And the trolley stops about 6 times, most of them giving you time to get out and enjoy the view and take pictures! During peak season, best to make reservations for the ride. Then have a reservation timed for when the ride ends at the lodge. The view from the balcony is magnificant. And the food was very good. We did not stay at the lodge, It looked like a good place to spend a day to explore after the trolley ride to give an overview.","October 4, 2013",Awesome!,28,"Austin, TX, USA",5
Crater Lake National Park,I took a trip to Crater Lake last week for the first time. It had just snowed a few days before and it is a sight that you have to see to believe. Crater Lake is a National Park in Oregon. There is a 33 mile rim drive around the lake but is only open from early July to early October due to snow. This drive will take at least 2 to 3 hours so you can stop at more than 30 scenic pullouts.There is a campground 7 miles South of Rim Village that has 212 sites that are open from May 31st to October 6th weather permitting. They offer tent camping and RV sites which some have electric hookups. They can accommodate up to 50ft. You can call 541-594-2255 ext 3610 for more information.,"October 3, 2013","CRATER LAKE "" A MUST SEE""",14,turlock,5
Crater Lake National Park,"We came at a bad time. It was snowing, raining, blustery, and freezing cold. In addition, the fog was so thick that we had a hard time seeing Wizard Island. And, to make matters worse, the entire eastern rim was closed off for some cycling event! But, despite the foul weather and missing out on half of the crater, we got a sense of how majestic this iconic landmark can be under better circumstances. The reason for our 3-star rating was not because of the miserable weather or our bad timing. Rather, it’s because of the park’s unenlightened policy toward man’s best friend. Dogs are not allowed on any of the trails or in any of the buildings.","October 2, 2013",Not Dog Friendly,80,"Cupertino, California",3
Crater Lake National Park,"It might not have been so bad if we just had to put up with the fog and snow, and no boat rides on the lake (They stopped them for the season Sept 15). BUT to top it off the National Parks Association decided to screw all their non-biking weekend visitors by closing 3/4 of the perimeter drive to motorized vehicles. BIKES ONLY. Apparently the local Oregon biker community lobbied hard and selfishly. I have nothing against cyclists but when they become self-serving and entitled they've gone too far. Wouldn't just a 4-5 hour mornin closure been enough? Or just a Sunday closure? I looked into trying to rent bikes, but there were no local options and by the time I found out it was too late to buy a bike rack for my car. They didn't even have the courtesy of providing limited bus access for their trolley tours. The road was closed from Friday night until Monday morning. We drove 8 hours each way to see a very limited view of the lake, and then it started to snow and the fog rolled in. What we could see was lovely indeed, so I have to return someday but I will NOT be making any donation to the Parks Service anytime soon.","October 2, 2013",Don't go after mid-September...,25,"San Francisco, California",1

Crater Lake National Park,"We purchased airfare and made reservations at Mazama cabins in May. When we arrived at the park on Sept 21 for two nights we found out the entire East Rim Drive was closed to cars! The entire weekend was devoted to bicycles on East Rim Drive. I have nothing against the bikes, it's just that I would like to have been informed of the event so I could make other plans. 3/4 of the things I wanted to see and do were on that road. Boo!- to the NPS for completely alienating a whole lot of people who showed up that weekend. The least they could have done is open the road to cars for a couple of hours before sunset, or they could have made a ton of money by running the trolleys along the East Rim with the bikes. At $25 bucks a pop, I would have paid it just to see the things I wanted to see. Poor planning, NPS!

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is spectacular. One of the most beautiful lakes in North America. We found that the best place to camp when visiting Crater Lake is at nearby Diamond Lake. The Mazama Village campground is ok, but the sites are away from the lake.By comparison, the campground at Diamond Lake has many sites directly on the water. The sites are quite large and have a fair number of trees. We stayed during labour day weekend when the campground was full, and still had a lot of privacy. Showers at the campground were clean also.It is an hour long drive to a proper grocery store from Crater Lake. The small store at Mazuma Village and at Diamond Lake Lodge sell basic items, but mostly junk food.

Crater Lake National Park,We entered the park from the Bend Oregon area. Glad we went in September because the crowds were down. There was a little snow and windy the day we were there but it just added to the experience. The downside of this park is that they will close half the park for a bicycle rally but not let you know at the entrance. The entrance fee is $10.00 but you only get an abbreviated look at the Crater and you do not get to hike some of the trails that take you down to the water.,"September 27, 2013",Beautiful,16,"Raleigh, North Carolina",4
Crater Lake National Park,We spent the day travelling around Crater Lake on a sunny day beginning at 9:30 in the morning. By mid afternoon the clouds had moved in. We took our time and stopped at each viewpoint. As we travelled in early September there were no crowds so picture taking was easy and as well we enjoyed the peace and quiet of the area.

Crater Lake National Park,"""The most beautiful place in the world!"" - my wife said. She is, on the other hand, a very positive person. But that says something about the place, she being a globetrotter. This must be the definition of Blue. You can't really look to much on the lake. But also, take a hike, and be prepared for a good workout. It's worth it though. The place to stay at is CL Lodge.

There was a descent sized storm which made visibility poor but made for dramatic vistas of the storm blowing across and out of the lake and mist creeping around trees and across the water. The storm didn't keep the wildlife away, either. In our brief visit we saw several deer and saw a hawk dive and grab prey. It was cold and wet but gorgeous and fun all the same.

Crater Lake National Park,"I went to see Crater Lake National Park, Oregon. This has to be one of the most beautiful,natural scenic wonders in the U.S., although it doesn't have millions of visitors as much asGrand Canyon, Yellowstone or Yosemite. It is worth the drive to reach its location in thesouthern part of the state. Nothing prepares you from gazing at the lake's deep blue colorupon first glance. Besides, the setting is in a near perfect round volcanic crater surroundedby a ring of mountainous cliffs and jagged rocks. Wizard Island breaks its surface with yetanother stunning wonder in the form of a symmetrical cinder cone. This must be the mostphotographed lake in the country if not the world. Also, the geological forces of Mt. Mazamaerupting 7,700 years ago are still evident as well as human history until the present. In all,a real gem not to be missed when you are touring the Pacific Northwest. There is a parklodge or hotel and Visitors' Centers too. Look it up on the web in Googles Images, or onFlickr and You Tube and also in Fodor's and Frommer's Guide to the National Parks of the West and you will be amazed at the photos and even more in person. By the way,Crater Lake is one of the deepest lakes, contains the purest water and cleanest airthan many other locations around the world. Views from its altitude is 100 miles in eachdirection.

The 30 mile drive around the rim offers spectacular views from the many overlooks! Dont miss this if you are anywhere nearby. We drove a couple of hours from Eugene to see it and it was well worth it, just be sure you have plenty of gas! We left the interstate at Roseburg and drove hwy 138 through the mountains. Its a gorgeous drive along the river but there are no gas stations or restaurants etc along the way! If hou are a hiker there are many many trails along the way and in the park. If you do nothing in the park but drive up and around the rim you will need about 3 hours, however you could spend an entire day easily! This is a DO NOT MISS Oregon attraction! We made many stops along the way to the park along hwy 138 as well, and then drove back through Bend And Sisters Oregon. This route allows you to see more of the Cascade Mountain Range and the Lava Fields if you want to (unfortunately we did not have time to stop by them). Stopped for dinner in Bend at the Riverhouse on US 97. Beautiful dining overlooking the river and food was great. This entire round trip from Eugene took about 12 hours and we could have used much more time!! Missed several things we would have liked to have seen along the way! $10.00 fee to get in Crater Lake Park.

It is absolutely stunning! The water is such a beautiful deep blue, that trying to describe it doesn't do it justice. We visited Crater Lake on a crystal clear day. You could see at least 100 miles in every direction. We had a clear view of Mount Shasta, which the Park Ranger said was very unusual. We decided to take the 2 hour Crater Lake trolley ride tour which is narrated by a Park Ranger. It was very informative.

Crater Lake National Park,"My wife and I arrived here for a 3 day/2 night trip in early September. The park is kind of remote and it can take a while to get there. We arrived late in the afternoon and were immediately impressed by the vistas at the rim. We couldn't immediately see the blues of the water due to the late afternoon sun, but it was still a great view. The next morning we did a boat trip out to Wizard Island. The late morning, early afternoon sun is what really makes the water here special. The water at Crater Lake is so clear that it can absorb all the long rays of the sun so that only the shorter blue rays are reflecting. The water at times changes between deep blue and turqoise with shades of green at the shallow areas. I don't think I've ever seen a lake with such colors before. But to really appreciate this you need to hike down the rim and take a boat trip. You can really see the difference in colors when you're closer to the water. Even better is a hike to the top of Wizard Island. From the peak you get great views of the water at all different angles and different lighting. At times areas of the water were white from the sun's reflections. This is definitely a unique place.","September 9, 2013",Unique National Park,48,"Miami, Florida",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We all hear about the Grand Canyon and rightfully so but I have heard very little about Crater Lake. We always visit National Parks whenever we can, I have the passport book and my husband has the free admittance card. We were staying in Bend and decided to visit Crate Lake one day. I had seen pictures of it and thought ""that is very pretty"" but the pictures don't do it justice. I wished we had more time to spend there.It probably helped that it was a beautiful day with clear skies. The water is the deepest blue imaginable, you think it can't be real but it is! Crater Lake was formed by a volcano called Mt. Mozama and with a depth of 1,943 feet, it the deepest lake in the United States, and the ninth deepest in the world! Only melted snow and rain water fill the lake, making it among the clearest in the world. You can drive around the rim, which is over 30 miles and you can hike down Cleetwood Cove Trail to the actual lake (the only means of hiking down). The trail is 1.1 miles long and drops nearly 700 feet down to the lake shore; it is listed as strenuous. You can swim there but I wouldn't do it, the average summer temperature is 55- 60 degrees...burr! There is a boat dock here where you can visit Wizard Island, a volcano located in the lake. For you fisherman, you can fish here for free and take as much as you want! You can also climb up to the Watchman's Tower for an even better view but we didn't have time to do that.There is a lodge here with a restaurant and the Rim Village contains gift shops and a café.They say that the sunrises and sunsets are spectacular... I'll bet that is true! I highly recommend this place!One more note...Don't forget to check out the Cascade Mountains on the way into the park and check out the trolley too.

As we were there at the end of the summer it was not too crowded but we can imagine that it might become very busy during the high season. Especially near the boat dock, traffic and parking was terrible.One remark on the downside, there are only a few pick nick spots along the crater rime road with each having only two to three tables.

After viewing the newly made video, gathering info in the visitors center, and having our questions answered by helpful rangers, we knew exactly what we wanted to do and see at Crater Lake. The boat tours were all booked early on our first day so we took the trolley ride around the rim road, explored Rim Village and hiked the Castle Crest nature trail. We booked an early boat tour for our second day. That boat tour was well worth the wait and is best way to experience Crater Lake National Park! The ranger interpreters gave excellent talks during the boat ride. Wizard Island was a real surprise. The hike out of the crater is real exercise, but there are many resting benches.

The best part - no construction allowed, so it still looks the way it did hundreds of years ago. The water is remarkably blue. Didn't do the boat ride, but I think that would enhance the experience greatly. A downside - dogs aren't allowed on any of the trails. Therefore, we drove around the lake, had a picnic, then left.

The park service has done a wonderful job preserving the whole area. Highlight of our trip was the hike down to the lake, and the jump off the 17 foot rock into the lake! So cold but so worth it. We took the boat tour too which was ok. But I would recommend saving that money and just hiking down to the boat dock and taking in the views for free.

Crater Lake National Park,"We visited Crater Lake on a very hazy afternoon in August. The color of the lake was not exceptionally blue, and the photos we were so excited about getting did not exist. Had the previous reviews not been so positive, this would have been a quick drive through of the park. Instead, we drove the entire periphery of the lake, and stopped at almost every overlook hoping to find a better view. In addition, we also took one short hike that led us closer to the edge. The geology of the area is very interesting, but the main attraction is the lake. If the atmospheric conditions are not cooperating, this park can be a big disappointment.","September 4, 2013",Disappointing,6,LOUISVILLE,3

A totally different view of the lake. Except me and my wife, everyone in our group enjoyed cliff jumping into the lake!

Crater Lake National Park,"On our recent trip out to the Pacific side of this great country, we took some time to visit Crater Lake National Park. We were there in mid June so there was still some snow on the ground so we couldn't drive the entire Rim Drive, however we were able to visit the western side of the lake...as well as take in the visitor center and gift shops. On the way in, at one of the first pull offs we climbed over the ridge to see the most beautiful blue water we have ever seen! What an inspiration to see such a sight. It was equally to learn how the park was created and learn a little about the history of the park. We were too early for the boat rides and couldn't do a whole lot of hiking to due to the snow pack but what we were able to enjoy was well worth it!

Crater Lake National Park,"Driving in Crater Lake National Park 12 hours after our departure from SLC, Utah, we were pleasantly greeted by massive trees lining both sides of the winding road up to the top of Mt. Mazzama. The crystal blue water that filled the mountain top's crater was not only enormous, but beautiful! Many short trails along the road up to the park from the West and along the rim displayed the diverse natural serenity only to be found thousands of years after a mammoth volcanic eruption: Enormous gorges blanketed in moss, steep cliffs greeted by birds of prey, multi-colored rock beds from which grew 100' tall evergreens with girths of 3' or more, scurrying ground squirrels collecting cheeks full of nuts from the lush forests, seemingly heavy boulders of pumice stone that our nine year old could pick up with ease, blue skies changing to pink and purple hues meeting the jagged edges of the caldera followed by the straight blue edge of the lake with the reflection of the caldera walls and sky from above.... BREATHTAKING. We had dinner in the lodge and enjoyed the view from one of three window tables at sunset... followed up with relaxing in one of the many rocking chairs on the rock patio as the sunset faded to night. Even the winding road back down to our campsite was surreal: silent and peaceful, dark and relaxing. We slept like babies!

Driving from Ashland, we arrived at 11:30 and found the boat tours sold out. The main headquarters near the park office is worth the stop if only to hear advice on options.As it turns out, given the length of the boat tour (3 hours) and lack of shade, it was all for the best we didn't take it. Also, it requires a 700 foot descent (& subsequent ascent) from the closest parking area and appropriate (read NOT sandals) footwear. The drive is something to behold with not a bad vantage point anywhere. We pulled off at most stops, and even drove all the down to see the chimney stacks, a 5 mile one way.Three pieces of advice, arrive early if you want to take the boat tour, bring hiking boots and use sunscreen frequently.

Crater Lake National Park,"From Vancouver, WA to Crater Lake, OR is about a five-hour drive - and it's worth the time. I loved the drive because I had a chance to view more of the state. The scenic points along the way are worth stopping. If you have small children, it's possible that your sanity will be taxed before you arrive. There are several locations to stop at along the way. I did this as a solo trip, so a large cup of coffee, and an audiobook made it a very easy drive. Crater Lake National Park is phenomenal. Bring food and drinks - sorry, it's a cold day in heck that I'll pay $5.00+ for a PB&J. There is plenty to see, lots of trails for biking, hiking, and relaxing. If your lungs can handle the trek, climb to the Watchman's Peak. I took the trolley ride around the rim. It was worth the money. Little kids could get bored - bring distractions.

Crater Lake National Park,"Mother nature at it's unspoiled best. This is a refuge that is free of cell phone service. Super clean air. The lake is so absolutely clear that the color is out of this world. This is a rural, national park, with great effort to keep it as pristine as possible. Appropriately, it is two hours from the nearest freeway. Views are fantastic and the rim drive is a good example of Civilian Conservation Corps construction from the 1930's. Spend some time to explore the park. There is a new, free and good video at the visitor center near park headquarters. There are lots of hiking opportunities, including one to the lake for guided boat tours (Advance reservations are required.) The facilities are classic and include the lodge with a spectacular view. The Lodge restaurant is expensive, $20-30 per person. The rim Cafe is $5-10 for very simple fare and prepackaged food. At Mazama village, 7 miles from the rim, there is a campground, restaurant ($10-15 per plate), cabin motor inn, small general store and gas station. If you can, attend a ranger talk at the campground amphitheater This is higher elevation 5-7,000 feet and the snow remains through July. So, take appropriate clothing; e.g. jacket for cool evenings in August. The lake can be clouded in often from fall through late spring. Often the ""fog"" doesn't burn off til mid afternoon.

Crater Lake National Park,"After driving forever to get there, over high, narrow roads, and passing through extremely dumpy towns (think Oakridge, Oregon), Crater Lake was, in a word, anti-climactic. Chilly unsettled weather didn't help, as it made the lake wavy and dully grey. The dry volcanic geography surrounding the lake wasn't beautiful, and even when the weather calmed down on our third day there and the lake shone blue, more like the postcards and publicity brochures show, it still wasn't the most spectacular sight in North America. Nice in the sunshine, but really just average compared to say, the Canadian Rockies - or the Oregon coast which we couldn't wait to head to after our so-so visit to Crater Lake. The interpretive centre was nice except for the glossy, sentimentalized movie (""the first time I saw Crater Lake...""I got seasick in the waves - lol). The boat tour went out in windy, suspect weather, whitecaps all over the lake, tourists without rain gear getting soaked in the spray - they should postpone the tours in those types of conditions, it just didn't feel safe, and life jackets were only voluntary for passengers over age 12.The Mazama campground (the only camping in the park that was open) was a dirty pit (separate review pending), garbage left in the fire grates and strewn around the picnic tables, the sites too close together, no privacy from screeching kids, or people slamming the bear caches open and shut. The bathroom buildings were old and cracked, the store was well stocked with dry firewood and supplies, all for a hefty price. The Rim drive was so scary with steep drops (no curbs or barrier in many places) that we didn't do the whole thing. The 'hike' down to the boat tour was an access road, not a trail. An overall disappointment, we won't be going back.","August 31, 2013",OVERRATED,102,"Vancouver, Canada",3

Crater Lake National Park,"The beauty of this national park is unexcelled, in my opinion. Crater Lake is the remains of Mount Mazama, a Cascades Range mountain/volcano that exploded millennia ago; filled with glacial meltwater, the crater lake is morning-glory blue and very deep, 1900+ feet. Travelers can drive the rim road, enjoying the beauty of the rocks, forest, and sheer drops of thousands of feet beside the road.I took the boat ride around the lake to get a closer look at the water, the shores and Wizard Island, a remnant of the old volcano. It is is steep walk down to the dock, and an even steeper walk back uphill; being in good shape is necessary.There is more to the park than Crater Lake--cabins, campground, restaurants, which I did not sample.

Crater Lake National Park,"I've lived in Oregon most of my life and I still run into people who live two hours from Crater Lake and have never been there. How sad. Maybe they think they've seen plenty of lakes, but there is nothing quite like this one in all the world. The sight of Crater Lake for the first time simply stuns people, like their first sight of the Grand Canyon. Sure, the lake is the deepest, bluest, clearest lake in the United States, but the real stunner is the volcano itself. You look down into and across the inside of a mountain that was once the size of Mt. Shasta. That it is now half-filled with water is almost just a bonus. The cliffs, some nearly 2,000 feet above the lake, seem to plunge straight down into the water. No one can throw a rock far enough to hit the lake, but that hasn't stopped millions of kids from trying. Only one trail goes down to the lake and the old saying is that it's a mile hike down and 11 miles back up. At 7,500 feet in elevation, it will feel like it. The lake is made even more beautiful by its islands, one a large cinder cone that nearly reaches the height of the rim. You can hike that island, if you catch the right boat tour and can climb quickly. The boat tours themselves are fantastic, if you can make the climb back up the trail to your car. My wife passed out on the trail when she was only 19, so don't overestimate your abilities. The drive around the rim and the facilities at Rim Village are open only in the summer months, though the park is open all winter with even more beautiful views. In truth, all of Oregon should be a national park, but only Crater Lake actually is, and for good reason. ","August 25, 2013",The one must-see in Oregon,113,"Brookings, Oregon",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We drove to Crater Lake with the kids. It has been smoky there but when we arrived, a thunderstorm had come through a few hours prior and allowed us to see the lake. The next morning the smoke was back. We drove the rim but could not see much beyond the lake. The mountains were engulfed in smoke. We did manage a few hikes: Sun Notch, Plaikni Falls and Cleetwood Cove. This is one place everyone should visit.","August 25, 2013",Beautiful place,189,"Nine Mile Falls, Washington",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Hi, My wife and I visited Crater Lake in Mid August. We had been there twice before, once in 1972 and then again with out kids in the early 1990's, but this time it was again just the two of us and the 30 pounds of photo gear I now travel with. As you can read many other places, Crater lake is what became of a volcano that blew its top leaving a wide caldera that eventually filled with water. Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the US, 2nd deepest in the Western Hemisphere, and 7th deepest world wide. It is completely surrounded by the caldera walls that form a rim around the whole lake. This means that it has no rivers or streams that flow into it and none the flow out of it making the water quite pure and uncontaminated by all those things that flow down rivers - in other words a ""Closed Ecological system"". However, it does have fish that are the result of some misguided folks in the past that stocked the lake with 6 species of which 2 are left. There are also some other invasive life forms in the lake that hitchhiked in on clothing, fishing apparatus or scuba gear. There are 3 roads that lead into the park. One from the North (Medford or Eugene), one from the West (Medford), and one from the South (Klamath Falls). We were coming from the San Francisco area (a one day drive) and instead of following the route suggested by our GPS, we stayed on I5 to Medford then took OR-62 into the park through the South Entrance. This was a mistake due to the amount of congestion in and around Medford. If you're coming from the South, take the route that goes through Klamath Falls and I think you'll do a lot better. As we were heading toward Portland, on the way out we took the North entrance.The only real facilities in the park are at Rim Village, Park HQ and visitor center (about 2 miles from the rim, and Mazama Village (about 7 miles from rim Village), all on the South side of the lake. The visitor center at the park headquarters is really nothing more than a gift shop and a movie. There is also a VERY small visitor center at Rim village. Other than camping, the only lodging is at the Crater Lake Lodge which is right on the rim, with views on the lake side that are out of this world (but so are the room prices), and cabins at Mazama (about 7 miles away from the rim). If you're going that route, book WAAAAAAAY early as they fill up for the season when most people are still opening their Christmas presents. We wound up staying outside the park at the Diamond Lake Resort which I'll write about later in another review.Now to the sightseeing. The lake surface is roughly 1000 feet below the rim of the caldera and there is only 1 trail leading down to it. This trail is on the North side of the lake, at Cleetwood Cove and is how you get down to the lake for the boat tour. Keep in mind though, at Cleetwood the lake is some 700 feet below the rim road which is not bad. However on the return,the rim road is 700 feet above the lake which should be taken into account.Speaking of the rim road, it more or less follows the rim of the caldera. It is 33 miles all the way around with 30 scenic overlooks. Without stopping it takes about 2 to 3 hours to go all the way around but what's the point unless you stop to look? We spent from around 10:00 am to 3:00 pm going clockwise from ""North Junction"" to the ""Phantom Ship"" overlook (a bit over half the circle). We then took a late lunch at Rim village, shot some photos from there and then backtracked to the Pinnacles area for more photos. As we needed to be in Portland that evening we left the Pinnacles area around 4:45 and got to Portland between 9:00 and 10:00. The Rim drive is wonderful, but don't neglect other areas like Pinnacles and the Pumice Desert (between North Junction and the North Park Entrance).FOR THE SERIOUS PHOTOGRAPHER: If you have the time do it in two days and overlap the sections facing toward and away from Sunrise/Sunset on alternate days. For example on day 1 shoot sunrise from Discovery point or Watchman and Sunset from Cloud Cap or Grotto Cove (check your sunrise/sunset times and directions for the day's you're there - there's a cell phone app for that) and pick your specific overlook accordingly. Then on day 2, reverse the process and shoot sunrise from the east side and sunset from the west side. We could only be at the park for 24 hours so after driving from San Francisco I only had one sunset opportunity on our arrival day, and one sunrise opportunity the next day. I had decided to start with the sunset at my back from discovery point as we didn't have time to get to get to the other side of the lake before sunset. Unfortunately there was a forest fire not too far away, up wind from the park, and the entire area was enveloped in smoke. So my sunset shots were for the most part a bust. I was able to get a few shots that I cleaned up in Lightroom but not the shots I wanted. I was skeptical about the next day's sunrise. If it was still smoky I might get some nice sky color but not the blue of the lake and I would probably do better to get some extra sleep. But, I dragged myself out of bed an hour before sunrise, and drove the half hour into the park to see what I could capture. I first stopped at Watchman and after checking my cell phone app for sunrise direction decided to leave several other photographers there and went down to a pullout about halfway to Rim Village. It was not marked but may have been Discovery Point and I had it all to myself. The sunrise turned out to be magnificent. The smoke had left the caldera mostly clear but there was still enough smoke in the higher atmosphere to give some wonderful color. In addition some nice clouds were about so it turned out to be worth dragging myself out of bed. (see photos attached or on my web - www.danhartfordphoto.com/craterlake). Later that morning there was still some smoke in the air but around noon it cleared. Other than Sunrise and Sunset when we get those marvelous colors in the sky, the best time to get that famous deep-deep blue of the lake is on a Sunny day in mid day. Part of the blueness is the deepness of the lake but another component is the rich blue sky reflecting on the lake. The lake is at 6,176 feet above sea level so the sky is a much deeper blue than one typically sees nearer to sea level. Once you've had enough views of the lake, look to the surrounding areas. One area that we went to is the Pinnacles area. This is at the end of a road the goes SE from the SE corner of the rim road (See Photos). The pinnacles are on an east facing wall of a small canyon where you are above them looking over the rim of the canyon. There are lookout areas on points that allow you to see them a bit from the side in addition to the straight down angle. As these face more easterly, it's probably better for photos to be there in the morning rather than the late afternoon when they start to go into shadow.If you found this information useful in your decision making process, you gleaned information you may not otherwise have discovered, or you just enjoyed reading it and appreciate the time I put into writing it, please give me a ""helpful"" vote. you can see more of my photos of this as well as other areas at www.danhartfordphoto.com","August 24, 2013","Yes, It's that Blue - Photgraphing Crater Lake",1406,"Palo Alto, California",5

The best that can be said of the view is that at any time of the day it looks like sunset.I asked a park ranger if this was normal and he laughed saying it is an inside joke that there are three seasons at Crater -- the mosquitoe, smoke, and snow. According to him the best time to visit is late September to early October if you want nice weather, no bugs and a view.Crater Lake is in the middle of no where, so it takes a great deal of time, gas, and money to see--plan accordingly.Bill","August 24, 2013",Smoke Gets In Your Eyes,16,"Plattsmouth, Nebraska",2

It is also valid at other national parks.The water is so blue, with some areas an irridescent green at the edges. On a busy day, parking spots can be hard to find, but it won't take too long.

Crater Lake National Park,"The Crater Lake National Park's website provided the title ""Like No Place Else on Earth"", and it is well deserved. I grew up in Southern Oregon, and have made many trips to the Park. It is hard to describe the appearance of the lake when you arrive at the rim. Very briefly, Crater Lake sits inside Mount Mazama, an ancient volcano which erupted about 7700 years ago. A caldera was formed and filled with water over the centuries. It is the deepest lake in the United States, and the natural water in the lake is the clearest you will find anywhere.The Park is open all year, but the rim and certain areas are closed for the winter, with the arrival of snow in mid-October until May. You will still find snow in parts of the Park even in June. There is a Visitor's Center at the rim, a Lodge, and a restaurant. Chipmunks happily scurry all around the parking lots begging for tasty peanuts. They do not know we are not supposed to feed them, but they still get their cheeks full.The Park website has a ""Current Conditions"" link, which is a ""must"" to check in early spring or late fall. There are many trails, and a rim drive (summer hours) where you can see spectacular views as you make your way around the lake. If you are in the area and have a choice, you are rewarded if you can visit on a cloudless day. The strikingly deep-blue water of the lake is magnified on a clear day. You can visit for an hour or two, or spend the day (or night) in the glory of Mother Nature. If you have the time, you can take a winding switch-back trail to the lake itself, and take a boat cruise which takes you around the lake with a stop at Wizard Island, and a close view of the tiny pinnacle of the ""Phantom Ship"". It is on the lake cruise you fully appreciate the translucency of the lake. On my first boat trip, I reached over the side of the boat to touch the water, and was startled when my hand sank in transparent water, maybe a foot or two above where I thought the water surface was located! You will have to hike back up the trail, so be prepared for weather, have proper shoes or boots, and bring water and a protein bar. In winter there is snow-shoeing and cross-country skiing in many areas of the Park. The Park's excellent website provides all the information you will need to enjoy your visit.The Park is a unique experience, and you won't miss the roller-coasters and shopping centers, even with the kids. It definitely should be a candidate for your ""Bucket List""!","August 19, 2013",Like No Place Else on Earth,78,"El Paso, Texas",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Taking a trip is absolutely worth the while. It is an amazing, beautiful place! We drove in from Eugene area on a Sunday morning, and the line to get in was pretty long. The park ranger informed us the smoke from nearby wildfires had cleared out, and it was clear in the park, so people were flocking in.We arrived about 11 AM and spent the morning and early afternoon on the north rim and rim village for a picnic. All the scenic spots were amazing and we took a lot of pictures!After a late lunch we headed to our campground in the park, at Mazama Campground (reservation made online) to set up. We were up early the next day and off to complete the drive around the rim. Again, beautiful. We did the hike down to the lake. It is steep, but I think the level of severity is overplayed to keep people from doing the hike, that can't. Both my kids (5 and 7) did the hike down and up no problem. Same for me and my husband (he's in great shape, me so-so!).Allow a full ""day"" of seeing/driving/stopping/hiking at a minimum. I would absolutely go back!","August 18, 2013",Amazing place!,18,Oregon,5
Crater Lake National Park,"We were here on the holiday weekend, July 4, 2013. Crowded right around park entrance but not too bad once we were in the park. What can i say? Beautiful, just beautiful blue lake. Wish we had more time there so we can take the boat tour to wizard island. Do reserve if you want to go on the boat tour. We heard the tour booked up pretty fast. It was 2 hour easy (in good weather condition) beautiful scenic drive from Medford, Oregon. The rim drive took about another 3 hour drive (with plenty of stops for photo ops). The park entrance fee was $10/car (which i think pretty cheap). Do bring snacks and water along. We got hungry driving around. Definitely worth the visit. And oh the park is super senior friendly (my mom was with us and she was able to enjoy the park without doing lots of hiking while having a bad knee).","August 18, 2013","Beautiful, beautiful blue lake",15,"San Francisco, California",5
Crater Lake National Park,"If you can get tickets you should! We took our 3 kids (ages 5, 8 and 11) on the 3 hour wizard island tour. I wish we had the 6 hour tour. We hiked to Fumarole Bay but didn't have time to make it to the water pools farther away. We would have also loved to do the hike to the summit. 3 hours is not enough time for us adventurous folks! The hike down to Cleetwood Cove took about 30 minutes. The hike back up was surprisingly easy for us. I expected it to be more tough because of all the warnings. We made it up in 30 minutes. No complaining even though it was hot. We are hikers though so if your family is not used to hiking it might be tough for you.

Take time to enjoy a ranger program or study at the visitor center to learn about this lake's creation and it's unique nature. We hiked to the top of Mt. Scott, in the park, and had amazing views of the lake and the whole park in addition to peaks further away. We also attended an evening ranger program where we walked to the top of watchman tower for sunset; it was excellent and we learned more about the park overall. We stayed at Mazama Village campground, which allowed us to see the park at sunset and sunrise. It was a large campground that had the potential to be a little noisy, but overall it was okay. Make a reservation in the summer!","August 15, 2013",Beautiful Park,53,"Vienna, Virginia, United States",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is amazing. From the scenic views from above and on the lake to the color of the water, I was wowed at every turn. A definite must see if you are anywhere in the area. We drove over three hours to see it and were definitely not disappointed. We took the boat ride on the lake which is also a ""MUST DO"". The only problem is that you have to hike down a mile and a half to get to the lake (but that's not the problem). The problem is hiking back out the equivalent of 65 flights of stairs. I'm 60 years old in average shape and had a very tough time going uo that hill. It took us 20 minutes down and 40 minutes up. But again, it was worth it. The ranger on the boat was very informative and friendly. He even stopped to give a Junior Ranger Badge to Zoey (8 years old), who was traveling with her mother and father.","August 15, 2013",Wow,90,"Long Island, New York",5

Crater Lake National Park,"We've been trying to go here for about 10 years and just made it this past summer. We could not believe how beautiful this lake and surrounding mountains were. To see the sum rise and set on the rim, to hike to the top of the lookout paths, to just sit and experience the awesomeness of this natural attraction was a boon. Don't leave here without taking the boat ride on the lake. We didn't go to Wizard Island, just the lake tour, but it was well worth the ticket price. We even got to see the 'old man of the lake.' It helps to go on a day with sunshine, but the natural phenomenon of the rock formations, lava flows, and water color can be seen anytime. There's only one path up and down to the water's edge, but the park did a nice job of keeping it graded, although I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wasn't fully ambulatory--it is steep.","August 13, 2013",Don't miss this natural wonder!,61,"Seattle, Washington",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We have been here three times and find something new with each visit. This was our anniversary trip and we started from Portland and drove to Ashland where our Shakespeare play was smoked out. Spent two nights at the Prospect Historic Hotel because we tried to book the Crater Lodge too late. However, we stayed there before and found no problem being about 40 miles away from the Crater. On the way over stop at the Park Headquarters for the T-shirt (if that is all you came for) and the great high-def 20-min. video on the history of the crater...awesome! We had taken the boats around the crater before, so we opted for the 33-mile drive around with some hiking here and there. The lake from any angle is incredible, almost like a (I hate to say it) a Disney production...unreal! The colors, clouds (no smoke the day we were there but had been days prior) and rock formations were truly unique. There are several places where you can get a great look at Wizard Island. However, the best view of the Phantom Ship is not from the Phantom Ship Overlook on the map, but from the (newly-maintained #14 on your map) Sun Notch trail. It looked like it was almost Photoshoped on the water...again, awesome. We had hiked the Garfield Peak trail before. Well worth the elevated view of the crater and surrounding vistas. Lest I forget, a ranger pulled a woman over for speeding in the Sun Notch parking lot, so watch your speed -- most of the drive is at 45mph. We got to the lodge around 4:30 with reservations for dinner at 6:30 so we sat on the patio and relaxed (as the smoke came rolling in from the west). It cleared out and you can see the Milky Way and every star you can imagine later at night. Yes, Arnold, we'll be back!","August 13, 2013",Crater Crazy...,69,"Portland, Oregon",5

Crater Lake National Park,"Visited late July 2013, did the boat tour and stayed in Crater Lake lodge overnight. The boat ride was fun, informative. The hike down to the boat tour is strenuous: it's essentially going down and then back up 76 flights of stairs (about a mile hike). Apparently they have to ""rescue"" people every few days, so be careful!! Older kids seemed to handle it without problems. Crater lake lodge was historic and a real treat. We didn't want to spend the $$$ in the restaurant, so we brought a picnic meal and that worked out fine. No refrigerator in the room though. TIP: As we planned the trip only a month in advance, crater lake lodge was booked. I called the lodge every few days and to my pleasant surprise, a room opened up. They have a lenient cancellation policy, so it wouldn't surprise me if this isn't uncommon.","August 11, 2013","lots of fun, great views",4,Shawnee,4

Crater Lake National Park,"Visiting every national park is at the top of my Bucket List. We generally do a national park road trip every other year.  Our first stop this year was Crater lake in Oregon. This place is remote and to my knowledge there isn't any camping right there at the lake so I reserved a lake view room at the lodge on the rim of the crater.The lodge itself was great. The food was good and the service was terrific especially considering how busy they were. Our room was not so great but most of the problem was due to a record breaking heat wave while we were there. This is a very old building and nothing is air conditioned. Our room was on the third floor with one dinky window. Can you say sweat box?? However, there was a tower fan in our room which helped somewhat. If I had it to do over, I would not stay at the lake. Even if you are big hikers, there isn't that much to do. One day would do it in my opinion. I was very glad I did not make reservations for the lake boat tour. They say it is a strenuous hike to and from the boats and they are dead serious. A very steep unpaved path w/switchbacks. We did take the trolley rim tour which was worth every penny. It was much safer to let someone else do the driving around the edge of the rim and the volunteer ranger obviously loves her job and the lake. Very entertaining AND informative. Words just cannot begin to describe how beautiful and blue the lake is, which is only filled by rain and snow melt, by the way. Also, if you haven't done it yet, buy a national park pass. AKA: America the Beautiful Annual Pass.It pretty much pays for itself the first time you use it. It's $10.00 for a life time pass if you are over 62. One pass gets you and 3 others over 16 into over 2000 parks. Under 16 are free.

Crater Lake National Park,"While there are forest fires that smoked-in Medford, the recent rain made it relatively clear at Crater. This lake and surrounding landscape has to be seen, as photos just doesn't show its splendor. 90 minutes northeast of Medford's airport. I listened to a presentation by a park ranger at the Lodge about the creation of this national park which has the US's deepest lake (and it us very blue). Took me 2 hours each time to drive around the lake and there are many viewpoints along the way. For the $10 park entry, you get a great map. At many of the viewpoints not only is the view fantastic, but the chipmunks and birds are good entertainment as the chipmunks will come right up to an outstretched hand. Afternoon best viewing is on the west rim (where roads are the best) while AM on the east (where roads a a bit bumpy).

Crater Lake National Park,"We live nearby and try to get here once a year. The lake is an unreal deep aqua blue. Unfortunately, it's often hazy there and this day was especially smokey, but that's not the Lake's fault. I feel the road at Rim Village is too tight for large RVs. There's a limited trolley offering, but tickets can be sold-out. The campground so tight it is unsuitable for anything but tents, campers, or very small trailers. The pull-throughs are too sharply angled between trees to be practical. (But how nice they haven't leveled all the trees like some mountain campgrounds.) The rim road around the lake is a great drive, plentiful turnouts/viewpoints but often limited parking (esp for RVers, despite earlier rave), and a few spots could use better signing. I wish there were wider spaces for bicyclists to safely travel, like much of the Oregon coastal hiway.

Get a room in the lodge, or camp. You'll meet PCT hikers, and others on great tours. Listen to the Ranger talks about the fascinating ecosystem that is Crater Lake. One minus: The boat tour operator manager made a series of customer service mistakes with us. We have sent a detailed letter to the contractor Xanterra. Please know that if you take the Wizard island tour, and not the standard tour, it is most likely to get cancelled. Ours did, when the regular tour leaving at the same time did not get cancelled. They have valid reasons for this, and clearly post the possible cancellations in their literature. Our issue was that there were two boats leaving the dock at the same time. Ours got cancelled and we were told the other boat was full, so we got in line to reschedule, then we saw the boat tour manager letting folks behind us on the other boat.

Crater Lake National Park,"My husband first saw Crater Lake as a small boy in the early 50's. He'd been planning to return ever since, which we did in early July. This time he wanted to get up close and personal with the lake, so we signed up for the Volcano Boat tour. The craterlakelodges.com web site provides a good description of the tour, and readers should take the warnings about the walk to and from the dock very seriously. Boating across the incredibly blue lake is a peak experience to be sure, but getting down to the launch site isn't all that much fun, and getting back up to the parking lot is a real huff and puff workout. From time to time the unwilling hiker will be able to rest on a bench or lean against a rock, but must inevitably press on. It is possible to go into the water near the dock, but be advised this requires a scramble over rocks. I figured I would break an ankle if I tried this!

Parking at North Junction and walking to the edge one is overwhelmed by the steepness of the caldera's walls and the blueness of the water. Reading the description of the caldera's origin and seeing the movie depicting the geologic history are experiences that leave one wondering about the forces of nature. A very educational trip. One unfortunate activity we observed was the feeding of the numerous chipmunks that greet visitors at the view points. In spite of warnings, people still feed these little creatures, either not realizing, or not caring, that they lose their innate ability to forage by themselves, thus making them less fit to survive the harsch winters. Please don't feed the wildlife!","July 29, 2013",Breathtaking view,10,"San Jose, California",5

The sights there are amazing. The drive around the rim is great with lots of wildlife to observe. The Lodge is lovely and very venerable.While we did not take the boat trip to Wizard Island, I can imagine how lovely it would be to see the Lake while riding along its surface.But the most impressive thing is the color of the water - almost indigo in its blue effect. The entire perimeter looks like a painting. I can imagine how the local indigenous people enjoyed its charms, centuries ago.It is worth every bit of a car trip - maybe 6 -7 hours worth from Portland - and of course other locations, longer to come to see.There are also terrific VRBO places in the area if you don't want to stay at the lodge or camp out. I suggest buying all your stores in Roseburg or Eugene, as Ft. Klamath does not offer much in the way of groceries. It gets snowy in the fall/spring and really snowy in winter (maybe 5-6 or more ft.)

We were based in Bend, and it was over two hours of driving to get to Crater Lake, but don't let that put you off. You just have to see this natural marvel!We arrived from the north side. The road ascended gradually out of the trees and then the land suddenly fell away to this vast, cobalt blue lake. We could easily have spent an hour at this one spot taking in the scenic wonders, but in fact there are equally spectacular views all around the rim, and I would strongly advise the visitor to make the 33-mile circuit of the lake to see it from all sides.Two things that we did that I would recommend:1. Hike up to Garfield Peak, about 90 minutes there and back from Crater Lake Lodge on the south rim. The trail is not difficult, and the views from the top are marvellous.2. Stop by the Steel Visitors Center on the south side and see the very interesting movie on the evolution of the lake.We would like to have taken the boat tour of the lake, but we didn't leave ourselves enough time to make the booking. This is someting that needs to be booked well in advance, it would seem.So if you are anywhere within 150 miles of Crater Lake and can only afford one day to visit, don't think twice.

The deepest part of the lake is more than 450 meters and it might be reason for this deep blue colour. Food is very good in the rim Village cafe.

Crater Lake National Park,"Last time I visited Crater Lake was some 30 years ago, when we stayed in the lodge because the snow in June was too deep to tent camp. I remember the tiny room and bathroom down the hall - happy to say that the hotel has been completely remolded - removed some rooms and added in-room bathrooms. Not as quaint, but more worth the price.Anyway, this time we only had a couple of hours before the park closed, so we took the tram tour, which is led by a Ranger. Excellent way to see all of the sights, and learn a lot about the geology - I didn't realize the eruption that formed the lake only occurred 7700 years ago, and it still remembered in Kalamath indian lore. Driving back down towards the Rogue river through the dense forests, it's a wonder anyone ever found the place!Lots of fun, really nice people at the park.","July 22, 2013",Worth the detour,12,"Lyons, Colorado",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake National Park is an absolute must-see. It's a natural wonder of the world. I have never seen water with the intensity of color as Crater Lake.

Crater Lake National Park,"While Crater Lake is a little remote - maybe a 1-2 hour drive from the nearest towns or I-5 - it is well worth the trip. There are spectacular views of the lake from several vantage points when the entire rim drive is open (July, August and probably September). Come in late May to the middle of June or so and you will likely find 6-12 snow packs, some of the walking trails closed, and the car driving rim trail not entirely open. Snow mobiles only in the winter, I suspect. The lodge is another gem - wonderful views and the service and food is excellent. A narrow porch with rocking chairs just outside the lodge gives you incredible long range views of the lake.

We took the car drive on a day trip, did not stay at lodge, nor took a hike. I want to go back for a sunset, or sunrise, or for a view with the crater rim with the first touch of snow.

Crater Lake National Park,"This was one of the last stops on a long road trip before going back to California, the original starting point. After visiting some really magnificent parks – Glacier, Yellowstone and Grand Tetons, I did not have high expectations. I had never even seen a photo of Crater and didn’t know anything about it, so I didn’t know what to expect at all. When we drove up the Cascade Mountains coming from the north entrance and got out for that first view, it took my breath away, it was so shockingly beautiful. In all of my vast world travels I have never seen another lake like it. The setting is so dramatic. The water is such a deep blue and it was so calm that there was a perfect reflection of the clouds in it. Continuing along the road, the views just kept getting more spectacular especially getting closer and closer to Wizard Island. At 592m/1943 ft., it is the deepest lake in the US and was created by a volcanic eruption 7,700 year ago, which left this deep crater where the mountain peak used to be. Then over many years the rain and snow filled it, turning it into this spectacular lake. Crater Lake was turned into a national park in 1902 and is in fact the only national park in Oregon. A must-see site! I would have loved to have had the time to take a boat trip on the lake. That must be fabulous.","July 17, 2013",Simply spectacular!,305,"Paris, France",5

Spend a couple of days here and did not see everything. Enjoyed the visitors centre and seeing the lodge. Did not stay in the lodge as need to book a year ahead. Drove around the crater over a period of two days. Saw many different views of the lake and Wizard Island. It is an incredible natural wonder and it hard to believe it is a volcano crater as it is still so large.

Crater Lake National Park,"Before you go, read up on how Crater Lake was formed and when you get there, its even more amazing. You drive up through forests and arrive at the top of a mountain to discover the bluest waters you've ever seen. Dramatic vistas in every direction and a then you realize you're on the lip of a volcano that exploded 6,000 years ago and then filled with water from rain and snow. The geology, especially when explained by a park ranger is very interesting. The 33 mile Rim drive is not to be missed. Do it in your own car (I suggest a detailed guide book/pamphlet to help you get the most out of what you're seeing at each overlook or on a trolley tour which is usually narrated by a guide. NOT TO BE MISSED is the 2 hour boat ride which leaves from the bottom of the Cleetwood Trail (on the northern end of Crater Lake). Yes, it's a long, fairly steep 1.1 mile, 700 foot decent down to the dock (and back up again) but on my trip I ran into several men and women in their 80's who did it. While it may take you an hour/hour and a half on the way back up, the narrated cruise of the Lake was the highlight of my visit to the park. Cruising on the lakes surface, looking up at the cliffs rising 360 degrees around you, getting close to Wizard Island and having a guide describe details you'd never discover on your own was awesome. Tough to get rooms at Crater Lake Lodge, book well in advance if you can. ""Rustic"" accommodations, great public spaces and a fairly good restaurant.","July 17, 2013",An amazing piece of geography!,14,Los Angeles,5

Crater Lake National Park,"We have been to Crater Lake in the winter to cross country ski, but not in the summer when the blue of the lake is at its best. It takes awhile to get to the park (most national parks in the West are off the beaten path for a reason), but it is well worth it. We walked the 1.1 mi down to the lake, jumped off the rock into the lake, then took the boat ride around the lake. REALLY beautiful - nothing else like it in the world! Supposedly the purest water with visibility in the 100+ feet range. The only drawback is the 1.1 mi back up the hill from the lake edge - quite a challenge since the elevation gain is more like climbing stairs than hiking. We stayed near Klamath Falls, OR and drove to the park. Made for a couple of long, but beautiful days. By staying in Klamath Falls, we were also able to drive to the Lava Beds National Monument with all of its lava tube caves. Makes for an exciting few days in south, central Oregon.","July 17, 2013",What a beautiful crater,22,"West Richland, Washington",5

There was a ranger there and I asked him how deep the water was. He smiled and said ""250 feet deep"". My son and I jumped in and it was exhilirating to say the least. 50 degrees!

Crater Lake National Park,"The first view one has of this ""lake"" is memorable. But by taking the time to hike along it's rim you realize you could look at it all day long and never become bored. We felt lucky to get a parking spot by the lodge as there were so many people here from all over the world. But once we started out on the Discovery Trail we quickly became the only people there. We hiked for a few hours and only came across a few fellow hikers and then the masses when we would come upon a parking view point. So all this being said definitely take the time to get out of your car and hike along the rim. Bring bug spray, a picnic lunch, and water. Trail is very easy for the modestly healthy person. My husband ultimately had to put a moratorium on picture taking because we could not stop ourselves.

The crater lake national park has a few very good hikes namely the Watchman overlook 9 7 mile) and the Cleetwood trail (1.1 mile). The Hikes are a little tiring but the view makes it worth the effort. The Rim Drive that circles the crater offers a lot of interesting vista points that are a must especially the phantom Ship outlook. If you want to do the boat ride on the lake book well in advance. We went on July 4th weekend and the tickets were all sold out. Its not a bad idea to bring a packed picnic since you can stop at a lot of location and enjoy an relaxing lunch on the edge of the crater.

The roads start of with 4 lanes and wind up with 2 lanes,and then become like the roads in Acadia National Park in, Maine. When you get close to crater lake you drive through a road that is bordered by very tall trees. The ride is tedious and you wonder what happened to a nice 4 lane highway, but the trip is well worth it. A gorgeous ride up to the park gets you to the toll both. If you don't have a Senior Pass it will cost you some dollars per car load. After the Ranger gives you a map and brochure you drive up a winding road and then search for a place to park your car. You walk over to the rim and the view is SPECTACULAR!! The is a beautiful dark blue that is rich and deep. Since this is a lake that formed after a volcano erupted eons ago, you find out that it is the deepest lake in America.

Crater Lake National Park,"For years, I said that if I got back to Oregon, I want to go to Crater Lake! We launched from Ashland (great town, Shakespeare Festival, near wineries) and took a 2 hour drive north to Crater Lake. We knew that we wanted to do the boat tour, but we did not pre-book (since we were afraid of the weather). When we arrived at the National Park, we proceeded to the Lodge where there is a kiosk to buy tickets. Luckily, we got on the 3:30 boat tour.With 3 hours before our tour, we drove the East Rim and stopped at the recommended sites. Excellent idea because the East Rim has some excellent sites. When we got to the trail for the boat, we planned an extra hour to hike down and spend some time dipping our feet into the lake! There were MANY brave people swimming in the 44 degree lake! The boat tour was gorgeous (we had an amazingly clear, sunny, summer day) and the ranger quite informative. BEWARE though, the park warns that the hike is STRENUOUS, and they're not KIDDING! The hike is a mile of VERY steep mountain trail. Down is no problem, but up is VERY difficult. We are very physically fit (not joggers but fit) and we had a very hard time with this hike. WE couldn't believe that people hiked this with small children- that is VERY brave. That said, the boat tour is totally worth the effort.

Plan for a little extra time if it's a holiday weekend as it will end up taking a little while to get into the park.

Crater Lake National Park,We were up most recently at the end of April and were unsure if we would get far because of snow. We called ahead and on a sunny warm day headed out- so glad we did- have never been this time of year- fantastic!!

Crater Lake National Park,"Crate Lake is a one-place-in-the-world location. The lake, five miles across, is amazingly blue, and Wizard Island seems very mysterious. Great views, great area for hiking, periodic boat tours, but no private boats on lake. Classic old lodge, forced ourselves to sit outside on the patio with a drink and enjoy the sun and the incredible view for about forty-five minutes until they could provide us a table for lunch (we didn't have a reservation). The meal was well-prepared, very tasty, and priced reasonably.

Crater Lake National Park,"I have been to Crater Lake National Park on 3 separate occasions. My first trip was when I was 20 years old; my best friend took me to see the lake when I went to visit her in Shady Cove Or. in Mid-July. At 20 years old I thought the lake was pretty cool, we took a trip around the lake but I was just pretty excited to be on my first vacation without my parents. Fast Forward 8 years. My boyfriend at the time suggested while he was deployed that he wanted to take a vacation to Crater Lake once he returned. He had seen a few shows on National Geographic and Discovery Channel about the lake and had to it for himself. We drove from SLC Utah to Crater Lake with our two dogs in Mid-May of 2011 and realized how much snow was still on the ground. Although we were able to make it into the park, you could only enter from the southern entrance and the rim drive was of course closed due to snow. This didn't stop him and me from falling in love with the scenery. The lake glistened with the snowcapped mountains all around it and the crisp clean air. There was no problem bringing the dogs into the park as long as they were on a leash. At the view point lots of great photos could be taken, but, we hiked a little further up the road and got some amazing shots. After taking in the view we went over to the Crater Lake Lodge to grab a drink and a bite to eat. They were in between lunch and dinner services so we were encouraged by the hostess to grab a cocktail. We sat by the fire place while one of the rangers gave a beautiful description and history of the lake and its origins. The ""Ranger talks"" as they called it lasted about 60 minutes and put us just in time for the dinner service. The dinner was amazing! I had the lamb risotto and my husband had an elk I believe. All was cooked perfectly and the wine was a perfect pairing with the wonderful food. Between our previous trip to Crater Lake and this one my boyfriend had proposed to me. We had planned a wonderful wedding in Utah, until we found out he was going to deploy. We then decided to hold off on the larger wedding and instead have something with just family before he left. He has an inherently dangerous job, so I wanted to make the small wedding something special not just a trip to the courthouse. We decided to invite our immediate families to join us for our wedding on September 15th 2012 at Crater Lake National Park. Since this was such a very special place for my fiancé and I, it was fitting that we get married there. I planned our mini destination wedding from SLC, secured cabins at the Crater Lake Resort, made reservations in Medford for a spa day at The Four Oaks Day Spa and for the ladies to have our hair and makeup done at Avalon Salon and Spa and following the wedding we were set up at the Crater Lake Lodge dining room for the reception dinner. I filed all the paperwork with the NPS to secure the Watchmen Overlook site for our ceremony for sunset. The wedding was beautiful; the weather was perfect although we had on lookers the setting was peaceful and serene. Our puppies were the Maid of Honor and Best Man, the lake was our backdrop and it made for such fantastic pictures. It was a bit windy, which we had expected but once the sun dropped it was quite chilly for those who didn't bring jackets. After the pronounced us man and wife all of the visitors who came to visit the lake applauded for us. We left the watchmen overlook and proceeded to the lodge where they had Champagne chilling that we brought in. The dinner was unbelievable, the staff was extremely attentive and the wedding a total success. We traveled to Newport OR. the next day to spend a short honeymoon on the beach. If you are wondering about taking a trip to Crater Lake, I highly recommend that you do it. I hope you fall just as in love with it as my husband and I did.","June 26, 2013",Crater Lake Wedding,34,"Eden, Utah",5
Crater Lake National Park,Visited on June 11th in wonderful weather although the east rim drive was still closed due to snow.Worth spending time at the Visitor Centre to watch the 20 minute film about how the lake was formed. In this film several people said that you'll never forget the moment when you first see the lake - when we walked up to the rim by the car park we could see why. WOW !! The blue colour of the lake surrounded by the snow-covered mountains must be one of the best sights in the USA.There are lots of stopping places along the rim drive towards the north entrance and these give very differing views of the lake and Wizard Island - all spectacular.We were just passing through on our way to the Oregon coast (having stayed at Klamath Falls the previous night - plenty of accomodation here and an easy drive to the lake) but the 3 hours or so we spent at the lake was still worthwhile. The boat on the lake hadn't started running when we visited but this sounds like a great way to view the lake.,"June 24, 2013",You'll never forget your first view !,23,"Nottingham, United Kingdom",5
Crater Lake National Park,"The most breathtaking high altitude views I've ever seen......yet also the most terrifying drive up the mountain. The weather at the bottom was 70 and sunny, but halfway up the temp dropped to 33 and it started snowing. Visibility was at an all time low as we drove through fog (and clouds!) alongside the edge of a cliff while only being able to see 2 feet in front of us.

Crater Lake National Park,"Only about a third of the Rim Drive was open June 15 due to the remaining part not having the roads cleared from snow or debris but that was enough for us. My grandmother said this had to be on my bucket list and she was right! Oh my! What beauty!! Parts of the road to the top was a little scary -- no railings and shear dropoffs!! But it was a beautiful day. We had to stop and take pictures of huge amounts of snow plowed on the side of the road, as well as snow covered grounds everywhere. When we left Houston it was 95, so this was a real treat for us!! So glad we went!","June 24, 2013",What a view!!,106,Spring,5
Crater Lake National Park,"From the time I started planning this two week road trip I worried whether or not Crater Lake rim would be open by the time we got there June 13th. I was relieved when I checked before departure and saw that the west rim was open. As we entered the area for the beautiful drive on two lane roads thru the forest it was overcast and even drizzling a little. Would we be able to see the lake when we got there??? As we approached the park, the light started to come thru and by the time we reached the rim the lake was in full view and there were big puffy white clouds in the oh so blue sky. OMG, how does one describe the blue---pools of saphire and emerald. It is truly spectacular. We had dinner at the lodge and the food was excellent, unlike our experience at the Awhwanee in Yosemite last year. We stayed in the cabins at Manzanita and they were much nicer than we had expected with all the amenities of a normal motel/hotel. Leaving the park the next day we had an enormous brakfast at Annies just past the entrance to the park. The portions were WAY TOO LARGE, but the food was very good and the gift shop filled with great stuff. Nice staff. Great experience with the contractor to the park, Xaterra. Give them Yosemite, NPS!","June 23, 2013",The overcast lifted and OMG!,15,"Sonoma, California",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We planned on going to CL last Wednesday but when we checked the webcam, it showed that it was raining, snowing, and little visibility. So we postponed our trip until today and what a difference! Weather in the 70's and mostly sunny. Be sure to check the weather report and webcam before you head there. The whole rim drive wasn't open for cars yet due to snow but bikes are allowed around the whole thing. We heard the whole rim drive will be open in a few days. We were happy with what we got to see. There were tons of bikers, must be a great to bike around the whole thing without cars. We were able to enter from the north entrance and drive up to the Lodge and down to the Steel Visitor Center. We stopped at several lookout points along the way and were able to take some great pics. There's still quite a bit of snow on the sides of the roads. By 1pm the sun was just right and the lake was crystal blue, just like the Carribbean! Our son did the Jr Ranger guide and earned a badge. Great free souvenir! Thanks Ranger Stephanie!!Mosquitoes are busy so be sure to come with bug repellant or cover your body. Tip: We stopped at the lodge to enjoy the rocking chairs that overlook the lake. Go inside the lodge and next to the restaraunt there is a drink bar. We ordered a glass of wine and sodas for our kids. They'll bring your drinks to you out at the rocking chairs. It's the perfect way to spend a little time relaxing with a drink and taking in the view. You don't need to order a drink to enjoy the rocking chairs, so bring your own drinks and snacks for free if you'd rather. ","June 22, 2013",Great day at Crater Lake!,14,"Seattle, Wa",5
Crater Lake National Park,"When we crested the hill and beheld Crater Lake both my husband and I gasped and tear’d up. It truly is a visceral experience. The depth of the water absorbs the light spectrum except the blue range. In addition, the lake is so still it reflects the blue sky. The double-blue effect renders the water an indescribable color that simply has to be seen. We found ourselves just sitting on the rim long after we’d finished our lunch simply staring into the depths of the lake. We were there the second week of June. There was still 12 ft. of snow on the paths and the entire E. Rim Drive was still closed. My advice would be to go later in the year so you can hike the trails and drive the entire rim. That said, one day at the lake was sufficient for us. We stayed at a B&B in the local town of Chiloquin which was nicer, quieter and less crowded than the accommodations at Crater Lake. It also gave us access to the entire Klamath Basin which would have been less convenient had we stayed at the Lake’s Lodge.","June 20, 2013",It truly is a visceral experience,86,"St. Louis, MO",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is a bit of a drive, but well worth the effort. The blue of the water is amazing, as are the rough ridges (creater rim) surrounding the lake.

Crater Lake National Park,"My wife and I stayed one night at the Crater Lake Lodge on June 8, 2013. The West Rim Drive was open while the East Rim Drive was closed. This arrival date was chosen as it was the night of the new moon and weather forecast predicted clear sky (i.e. dark sky conditions for photography). We arrived at the Crater Lake Lodge rather late because of an airplane delay. Nevertheless, the dining room staff allowed us to order some Marionberry crisp which was really good. Indeed, we found all the staff we encountered to be exceptional and pleasant. We enjoyed sundown at the lake from the Watchman Overlook; although it was not that spectacular with the best viewing being the changing light off of the caldera wall.Our room was a lake-side view which offered a nice view of the lake. At about 11:30 pm the stars were numerous from the window in the room. The Milky Way was well defined by simply walking to observe near the Rim Valley gift shop overlooking the lake. There were few lights so a (red) flashlight was handy. Images of the Milky Way with a camera and tripod were also gotten by driving (slowly as there are shear drop offs!) along the Rim Road to the Watchman Overlook. For dawn and sunrise images (dawn being before the sunrise rose over the caldera wall) the Watchman Overlook and Discovery Point were good photo areas (for this time of year). A note, mosquitoes were aggressive and numerous during our visit, sometimes swarming (especially in areas densely forested along Rim Drive). However, we were prepared by wearing long pants, shirts, jackets and mosquito netted hat when photographing which prevented bites. After not sleeping much at night and getting up early, breakfast was well anticipated. We both had the Meadows Omelet (with wild mushrooms and fresh spinach) which was very tasty. We rested after breakfast and went out to view the lake at ~ 11 am. Crater Lake was deeply colored blue at this time of the day. We really enjoyed our brief visit to Crater Lake National Park.","June 15, 2013","Crater Lake At Dawn, Sunrise, Day and Night",6,North Carolina,5
Crater Lake National Park,"This is a unique lake with beautiful views, as many visitors have stated. Since we didn't have a lot of time that day, we stopped at the Visitor Center to find out the best route to take, and they were very helpful there. We decided to drive along the west side of Rim Rd. and stop at the North side to do the only hike down to the lake, the Cleetwood Cove Trail. The parking lot near Cleetwood Cove had portable toilets, in case you need to go. Would be nice if there was a better choice, especially since this is such a huge attraction in Oregon. The trail is very steep. Going down we saw some people struggling to hike uphill. We really wanted to go on the boat tour but it was too late since the last tour was at 3:30. We found out you should make reservations in advance. Here's the info: http://www.craterlakelodges.com/volcano-boat-cruises-8644.htmlIt was nice by the water and there were more people down there than I would have expected. Hiking up the steep incline was strenuous while it lasted, with lots of switchbacks, but I thought it was a pretty short hike so it wasn't that difficult overall. It took about 30 minutes for us to hike up. This is coming from someone who did an extremely difficult 6 hour hike the week before, so you may want to consider that if you choose to do this. I thought it was a great way to burn off some of that weight I gained during vacation! :)I would have liked to have more time to check out other hikes for more variety, and to see the rest of the area.","June 15, 2013",Lovely day trip,140,"New York City, New York",4

Crater Lake National Park,"Just finished my first visit to Crater Lake. The weather was beautiful and warm but there was still lots of snow on the ground. Unfortunately most of the park, including the trail down to the water, was closed due to lingering snow. And because of the melting snow, the bird-sized Mosquitos were ferocious! Bring plenty of bug spray if you're staying in the campground, at least until all the snow melts.But the view of the lake was amazing! The surrounding mountains were perfectly mirrored in the lake. I know everyone says it, but the water is preternaturally blue. Bring a good camera! The staff were friendly and talkative. The air was fresh and piney, and the campground was gloriously quiet, even on Fri and Sat nights. Except for the PCT which runs thru the park, there's not much to do, so two or three days are really all you need to experience the park. The ranger told me the boat tours will begin at the end of June. The Lodge was pretty but not as majestic as some of the other National Park lodges like the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone. The furniture is Old Hickory and mission style (possibly Stickley tho no one could tell me for sure). There's a large stone hearth but it's a gas fireplace. If you're into rustic NPS architecture, try the Lady of the Woods trail...a half mile trail around the residential area of the park which begins behind the large visitor center halfway between Mazama Village and Crater Lake. The buildings are incredibly beautiful and classic NPS rustic. Gas is available in the park but not diesel...I strongly suggest you do your homework before you go and locate the closest gas station (I found diesel in Chemult). The park is very remote. Also food options in the park are limited and expensive.","June 11, 2013",Amazing Views,32,"Tucson, Arizona",5

Very pleasant roadways, not too difficult.Along the way, it was nice to see all the camping sites and cabins that are available and made me long to go back and stay closer to the lake. There was a cute little ice cream, restaurant and general store (Becky's I think) that also had a stand alone BBQ trailer that was cooking up some delicious smelling food.One at the entrance of the park, it was great to see efficiency in action as a park ranger walked back and took payment so we could all get through the line more quickly.We drove up the west rim, and stopped to play in the snow with our grandkids (2 feet), and then went to a couple of vista points to take pictures and sightsee.A word of caution, you want to be sure the kids are well supervised as the rim is a bit dangerous. We did not see the lodge which was full for the weekend we were there otherwise we might have spent the night there.We definitely want to go back and explore more: The lodge, hiking and other activities.

The crater was formed when a volcano blew its top leaving behind a crater some 6 kilometres wide. As Crater Lake is above the winter snowline is gets plenty of snow -about 10 feet plus when we were there in April. In summer the snow melts and tops up the lake - over 300 metres deep. The attraction is about an hours d'rive from the Interstate I5 and can be viewed winter and summer as the roads are snowploughed daily. We drove up in a regular 2 wheel drive SUV. We visited basically end of winter and the top of the mountain was well covered in snow. During winter you can go skiing, and during summer there are great hikes and camping in the wilds.

The lake is an intense blue and at nearly 2,000 feet at its deepest point, it is the deepest fresh water lake in the US.There is a road that runs the entire circumference, but it isn't always open. There is a fee to get in (hint, if you're a senior you can buy a $10 pass that gets you into all National Parks, good for life!).

The last time we made the drive was on October 7, 2012 a spectacularly beautiful sunny day. The distance between Ashland and Sunriver is such that if you take off about 10AM in the morning you can pull into the lodge at the lake just in time for lunch. The drive itself, that day, was beautiful, and with no wind the lake was a perfect reflection of the forest and mountains that surround it (a perfect picture for a jigsaw puzzle). Lunch at the lodge was great - good food, good coffee and great service. They had a Monte Cristo sandwich on the menu, something I haven't seen for a menu for 30+ years.After lunch we drove part of the rim road, stopping at several of the observation points to enjoy the lake. However, the best view of the lake is from the backporch of the lodge! It is clear that the lodge was built where it was because it is the best spot for viewing the lake.Does it get any better than a trip that includes great food and performances in Ashland, followed by a trip to Crater Lake and sometime in the natural haven that is Sunriver and the Deschutes National Forest?

It is April 19th and we decide to do a day trip from Mt.Shasta. So we leave about 9:30AM and head to Klamath to see the falls. We pulled over to find exactly where the falls are located. Alarmingly there is a tap on the glass on the passenger side of my truck and it's a State Trooper. OOPs! He was very nice, asked it were had a problem. We said ""we are trying to locate the falls."" He looked at us with a puzzled look and said, ""There are no falls here in Klamath Falls.""OK, so we had lunch and drove to Crater Lake, a beautiful drive on a bright sunny day about 60F.When we arrived at the south entrance (north entrance closed) I noticed a trace of snow on the side of the road. ""Oh, it must have snowed here recently.' Then it started to rain with the sun shining, we drove on a nice, clear paved road toward the Park Headquarters 7 miles. At about 3000 feet it started raining harder, temperature dropping and very overcast, 5000 feet snowing harder temperature 37 F. By the time we reached the Park Headquarters, 6450 ft, temperature 31F. it is snowing hard so we stop and go in to find if out can we go further. The ranger tells us, ""Yes the road is open but it is so overcast you can not see the lake.""

Crater Lake National Park,Crater Lake is beautiful in every season. Views from the rim road are stunning with the color of the water and mountains changing from minute to minute. Cycling around the rim is a great way to take it in slowly. The climbs and descents are not too long and challenging but be prepared for the thinner air at the higher altitude. Traffic can be a bit heavier in summer. Beware that the roads can be icy in the shoulder seasons.

I visited with my son, we drove down from Portland via the coast to sight see along the way. He surprised me by scheduling the boat tour for us. The tour is nice, giving you the perspective from inside, although be prepared to hike down and back up again.

Crater Lake National Park,"The anniversary we were celebrating was in May, but I put the vacation off until June hoping we'd get to see just a little bit more of Crater Lake. The delay paid off, because the North entrance opened the day we drove down. It was a twelve day tour of Oregon and I decided Oregon was easily the most beautiful place I'd ever visited and Crater Lake is easily the jewel in the crown.The National Park Service website is very handy for this attraction. It keeps you well informed about the park. I'd recommend bookmarking it if you're planing to visit. I knew before I got there that only a portion of the park would be open and had fun watching how much of the north entrance road was being plowed during the weeks before my visit.However, no amount of planning can prepare you for the impact of your first glimpse of the lake. How did anything ever get so blue? I'd looked at a lot of pictures of the lake, but until I saw it, I was sure they'd all been photoshopped. Nope, it's just that blue. I'm glad I went when snow was still on the ground, because I think the stark white enhanced the color.We were there only a few hours, taking pictures, playing in the snow, visiting the gift shop and inn, but it was a marvelous few hours. The park is open all year, but during winter there's only a small bit available. Don't let that deter you. This place is gorgeous. If all you get is a brief glance at the lake, it's worth the drive from wherever you are.","March 18, 2013",Beyond My Expectations - and I expected a lot,314,"Dallas, Texas",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is wondrous at any time but you may think summer is the only time for hiking or family...not so. We visited on a Sunday, busy but not crowded, clear blue sky and light clouds reflecting in the lake. So what to do: only the visitor center and small store/deli are open?!? Take a hike! The rim road is snowed in but cross country skiers keep the track fresh. No skis, no problem. We did not even use snow shoes and hiked nearly 3 miles out on a pretty well packed snow path. Most of the time we were by ourselves. And if the quiet of nature is important, know that snowmobiles are not allowed at the south end of the park at all, so it is just the wind and the voices, yours and the others who take the chance to get out of the car. Several families with smaller children also hiked or skied that afternoon. Highly recommended! No fee in winter.","March 14, 2013",Winter Hike at Crater Lake,21,"Ashland, Oregon",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Definitely worth the trip - a BEAUTIFUL, beautiful place. The lake is a deep blue color, surrounded by a perfect circle of mountains.There is a smooth, but steep trail leading down to the lake, where the brave can actually swim/jump off cliffs into the water. The surrounding area has a lot of great hikes (mostly up to the tops of various mountains) that offer great views of the lake and surrounding mountains. Most trails are very 'thin' in some places, so it's not for the clumsy as the drops can be deadly. The Lodge/restaurant is very nice, with great food and cute souvenirs. There is also another group of buildings that has a store, laundromat and shower facilities (close to the campground).There were only two downsides, that weren't a HUGE deal: 1)the drive around the lake (essentially a circle of highway) has a canyon wall on one side and a death drop on the other. Not for nervous drivers. 2) My friend and I camped there in July 2012 and there was still snow in spots. It was fairly warm during the day, but the night dropped below freezing.

Crater Lake National Park,"It goes without saying that Crater Lake itself is stunningly beautiful. That said there isn't much you can do here that can't be done in a full day or 2 at most (unless you want to hike in forest). There are some nice dayhikes that offer different views of the lake. I hiked to Discovery Point and back and then up Garfield Peak (though the top was technically closed for snowfields).Away from the lake I also hiked Godfrey Glen and Annie Creek Canyon trails, which offered some cool scenery of pumice erosion, including smaller versions of The Pinnacles. Because the E and SE section of Rim Drive was still closed in mid-July, we couldn't hike Mt Scott or see the Pinnacles from the normal routes. I did see the latter on our way out by following 10 miles of gravel forest service roads to come in the back way. I had to hike the last 3 miles of road because it hadn't been cleared of downed trees yet. It was worth the hour hike and I also learned that this used to be the official entrance to the park decades ago!For the very adventurous, Llao's Hallway is a pumice slot canyon just a few hundred yards north of 62 on the way in from the west. Don't go solo, take a rope, and you will get wet and dirty. Turn back if you hit blocks of snow in the slot as I did.","February 17, 2013",Don't forget Pinnacles and other dayhikes,85,Terre Haute,4
Crater Lake National Park,"This was our second visit to Crater Lake. The first time was in August 2002 (ten years before) and then the lake was often obscured in thick haze from nearby fires and by late afternoon the lake would completely disappear from view. This time in August 2012, we drove to the lake and it was clear the entire time (there were still fires in nearby places though). The lake is one of two icons of Oregon (the other is Mt. Hood) and there is quite the impression of its size and color. On our full day camping here, we climbed to the viewpoint on the west side of the lake (can't remember its exact name, it is a ways north of where the lodge and parking facilities are located) and also did the full drive around the rim in a clockwise direction (the previous time we did not get much further than Phantom Ship viewpoint). There were some bits of snow down in deep areas and we camped in the main site on the south entrance road. While it is a ways from the nearest big city (Portland), this place is still worth the drive to go to.","February 8, 2013","First time - a bit obscure, Second time - excellent",81,Victoria BC,5

Crater Lake National Park,"Made sure we stopped there on the way up to Bend and we were not disapointed! It was only a passing trip so was purely sight seeing and photo taking so that's all we can really comment on but for those two things alone, it was very spectacular. We stopped at the main area where you will find the beautiful Lodge, the gift shop. info centre and food options. Be aware, the food up there is incredibly expensive. Even just for a Sandwich and Chips. I don't want to quote a number as I cannot remember exactly, but I was actually quite disgusted at how expensive it was. Other than that, I couldn't really fault the place though. Having thoroughly enjouyed the views from the main area, we headed around the West side of the Crater where the road climbs slightly and offers a couple of even more elevated view points that were even better!

There was so much snow; we were lucky that the main road leading up was plowed. I'm from Upstate NY and say this. We climbed atop a large bank to view the lake, but the snow and wind blocked it entirely. We went down to the visitor's building (whose staff was great by the way) for a while to wait, went back up, and there it was. Absolutely stunning. I'd love to go back during the summer so I can drive all the way around the rim and see other areas, though I recommend this park point blank period. My advice?

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is just a short distance from where I live and I try to spend as much time in the park each year as I can, in all seasons. The park get approximately 533 inches of snow each year and I don't do icy-snowy roads unless I have to, but make a point of visiting the park at least once during the winter months.If you love to hike, there are several hiking trails that will get your blood pumping: Mount Scott, Garfield Peak and Cleetwood Cove just to name a few.The driver around the lake is approximately 33 miles which does not include the 14 mile round trip to see the Pinnacles. This is a must! If you are into photography, I recommend stopping twice on your trip. Once in the morning and then again in the late afternoon to get the good light in each time of the day.Again, if you are doing photography and hiking, I recommend Mount Scott as a morning hike and Watchman Peak as an afternoon or early evening hike. Garfield Peak and Cleetwood Cove can be doing anytime.There is a deli and gift shop at Rim Village. Before entering the park, there is Annie Creek gift shop and restaurant which are excellent.The Lodge at the Rim also has a wonderful dining room with good food.Crater Lake is a little out of the way, but having a love for this park, I highly recommend a stop and not for just a few hours, spend the day; get out and hike!","January 26, 2013",In my Backyard!,94,BONANZA,5

Crater Lake National Park,"I visited Crater Lake National Park in July 2012. Undoubtedly one of the most gorgeous places in the United Sates, let alone on the planet. Stayed there for 3 days, plenty to do. You can even actually go down and swim in the lake. I had the brilliant idea to jump off a cliff right into the lake and dislocated my shoulder landing in an awkward position when i hit the water. Still, if I had to chose one single place in the world to dislocate my shoulder, it'd probably be Crater Lake National Park. The view eased away the pain...not really, it hurt pretty badly. But still, it's a must see if you're in Oregon.We stayed at the Mazama Campground, it's a short way down about 5 miles from the actual Crater. The nights were damn cold, even in midsummer, below freezing. I strongly advice good winter camping gear, or at least a decent amount of clothing.

Crater Lake National Park,"We spent 2 days at the Crater Lake Lodge in July 2012. Lodge is so far off the highway, it takes 25+ miles to reach it. Place has been upgraded and has wifi - but no TV. Spartan but comfortable. Eating is a challenge as the Lodge is the only option. Make dinner reservations as soon as you check in - or call from the road. More people then wait staff, so without reservations, you will have to dine in the lounge and hope to grab a table or couch as people finish and leave. Eating outside is beautiful but can be difficult if crowded. Good selection of craft beers. Ignore these petty inconveniences, a grab a drink and just gaze down into the perfect and still blue water that stretches for miles. Breakfast is not a problem for early risers. Be sure to take a cruise on the lake. 30 minute trek down to the water - and a 30 minute hike back up! A workout. Overall, Crater Lake is worth the drive from Portland.

More recently I decided to take a friend and explore more deeply the areas around the lake. First I recommend anyone going take a good look at the Crater Lake Lodge. It sits on the Rim over looking to the lake on one side and a Mountain Meadow on the other side... wild flowers scattered the meadow making both scenes lovely and relaxing! the Room was so beautiful with an old claw-foot bathtub, decorated with photos of the past from the area... one window overlooked the Lake. Downstairs in the main lobby beautiful bark-covered trees act as pillars, and a roaring fire in the giant rock fireplace added ambiance to the room. For an afternoon excursion we drove down to the pinnacles an incredible site as well... as tall pillars seem to raise up for no reason out of a canyon there... very worth the trip and hiking around the area. So much to see, so little time, one could really spend weeks exploring and not be satisfied. Food is available as well as a gift shop, but be prepared for high prices.

We did the drive around the lake, which takes a couple hours, and at each turn in the road, we saw another spectacular view.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake was formed when the top of a volcano collapsed. There is an island inside the lake that is actually a small volcano with the lid on. The area is quite isolated, but serene and beautiful. A trip to Crater lake is a good choice, just be alert of how far away it is from major cities. (Portland is 5 hours away.) Plan on spending at least a couple hours at the park. A full day would be better. I noticed lodging at the western edge of the park and I think in Oakridge. Several hotels are in Medford (90 minutes away). The drive from Medford is breathtaking and through a forest -- one of the prettiest drives I've ever done. If you go in the Summer, they have boat tours to ride around the lake.","October 19, 2012",Crater Lake is serene and beautiful,26,"Alliance, Ohio",3
Crater Lake National Park,"I flew into Portland for a week and half long conference on industrial pipe bending. I had some time daily to venture off on my own and had the entire weekend to myself. The concierge at my hotel and a few others were barking about how great ""Crater Lake"" is. I went on trip advisor and saw the reviews thinking this was a cant miss. Boy was I wrong. Let me break it down for you, its essentially a deep lake. Big whoop. I can only see maybe 10' down and then its black so why do i care if its 12 feet deep or 12,000? Also, according to wikipedia its the 9th deepest lake in the world, so im essentially wasting my time. Wizard island was the biggest joke and waste of a time. Nothing even happens on that island that is remotely entertaining. After walking around for a bit wondering if there is anything else to do at this hole of water, I headed back to my car. On the way there I slipped and fell in what i can only imagine was animal droppings. I got it all over my boots, jeans and shirt. The smell emanating from the poo was atrocious. Luckily I had a duffle of clothes to change into. I left after maybe an hour and half of walking around. Do not drive out of your way for this hole of water.","October 17, 2012",Deep Lake...Big Whoop,18,Grand Rapids,2
Crater Lake National Park,"My best friend and I drove 5 hours one-way out of our way just to see Crater Lake while we were visiting the Pacific Northwest. It was definitely worth the drive. This place is absolutely beautiful. The scenery is stunning and will leave you in awe of nature. We did one of the short hikes up to a lookout point and had even higher views of the surrounding countryside. The sunset here was picturesque and the weather quite cool. The water is a deep blue. The cliffs drop straight down, so be careful not to get too close to the edge. There were some public bathrooms available, but they were disgusting and had no electricity, so at night you need to bring a flashlight. Bring a jacket with you if visiting this place or else the chill will eventually get to you even in the summer.","October 17, 2012",Worth the long drive!,126,"Jacksonville, Florida",5

On the loop road around the lake, the turnouts are on the right side, so I recommend you drive the loop clockwise. The roads are all two lanes and mountainous. Some of the roads are closed in Winter.

The road round the lake was very busy. We were surprised that the National Park staff didn't limit numbers arriving at the park. I think there may be plans to do this in future. We decided to stop at the Pinnacles where there was a trail and fewer people. The rock formations left over from volcanic activity were spectacular, so worth the trip after all.

For everything in between it is simply heart stoppingly beautiful and just might account for the fact that it is indeed one of the ""Natural Wonders of the World."" . This is a destination that is unspoiled, pure and not to be missed. There is a reservations required historic lodge that is wonderful.

We traveled around the rim and looked out at each viewpoint. We hiked to the top of the Watchman Peak to watch the sun set and the full moon rise, which was spectacular.

Some viewpoints are more crowded than others but you should have no problem getting excellent photos.

You can drive or ride the trolley all the way around the lake and stop at various viewpoints for photos & beautiful vistas. Since we were there after Labor Day, no boat tours were running and the docks were moved to Wizard Island for the winter. No private boats are allowed on the lake and, since the water averages 60°, swimming isn't recommended. There is limited fishing if you are willing to walk the 1.1 strenuous Cleetwood Cove trail down to the lake, but remember, you have to go back up the same way. The Rim Village has a visitor center, cafe, book store & lodge. Also look for the Sinnott Memorial Overlook near the lodge. It is a very photogenic structure on the rim as well as a good viewpoint.

This is a rare lake in that it is not fed by a river, stream or creek and does not empty to a river, stream or creek.

Crater Lake National Park,"We toured this lake, August 31, 2012. We arrived at 9:00 am to the entrance but stopped at Annie’s restaurant and gift shop. This is a nice place to eat and shop. The gas station is behind this but you have to go down the road and thru the gate then make a right into the campground area.Once thru the gate it is about 4-5 miles to the entrance of Crater or I should say where the loop road begins. The visitor center is also located here and so is the post office.I had read to start counter clock wise around the loop mainly because the road proved narrow and it would be a concern for campers and such but I never thought the road was that narrow anywhere. Also, by going around the crater clock wise my mom was always in view of the not so clear lake that day, when it was in view. Ok, on we go. Another couple miles up twisting roads we hit the historic hotel and yet another gift shop. We grabbed a quick bite in their sandwich shop and yes, we shopped again. I was hoping for it to clear up.We had beautiful weather but unfortunately the wildfires construed a lot of the viewing. The true blue of the lake could not be seen in the distance in the early morning hours and just barely around the rim. The crater walls on the other side were barely visible. Later in the day as the winds picked up slightly, the lake became a little clearer and showed a little more blue. We decided to go around again to the first 3 stops. Two of them did prove to have cleared up but the 3rd was not there yet so we decided to turn back.The 32 mile loop drive is very nice indeed. Don’t get me wrong, we got some really nice pictures just not the kind on the postcards.We stopped at the Pinnacles which I think you must stop at. These lava protrusions are unique and interesting not to mention make a great picture. The trail is supposed to be a half mile one way. Well, I did that a little more than ½ mile thinking there must be more but nada. In my opinion, go about 1/8 of a mile or no more than a 1/4 mile and look back. Honestly, the picture is great looking back early on but does not get any better down the path. If you want to walk it for exercise, then the turnaround is a big cement karn. I did not know this and continued to walk all the way to the service road. Oh well, at least it was a nice day.My mom did not go because she is 80 and thought it would be too long of a walk and I hated telling her she could have done this one with ease. The path is tree lined for a good part and very level. I think a wheelchair might be able to go over this.Before this or right after (I forget) is Vidae Falls. This is a nice little stop with no walking. There is a hidden trail no one seemed to be picking up on the far right and this provided the full length shot. These falls are high!!! They were not very full this time of year but none the less, I would stop again to see them any time of year.We stopped at all 30 some stops even if just for a minute and I found darn near all of them worthy. I strongly suggest staying at the beautiful lodge for the night and taking your time viewing and hiking. If you can't and have limited time, then I really think you can't enjoy this unless you allow at least 3 hours for the lake itself.Before I end this, I would like to make a comment on the drive here from Grants Pass, OR. We left around 7:00 am and arrived at 9:00 am. The drive was beautiful. The gas stations are limited and even if we found one, most of the time it was not open. The towns are really small along the way. Fill up before you leave! As I stated, they have a pump in the park. This also means, bathroom facilities can be limited. After we left the park, we arrived in Klamath Falls around 5:30 pm.One town, Shady Cove, I mentioned to my mom if I were to live in Oregon in a small town that it would be there. They kept it clean and albeit small, it seemed to have just enough. Multiple gas stations were open here.The drive out of the park to Klamath Falls is farm country which I found every bit as beautiful.

You really need to be in good health and shape as you need to hike down to the boat, only one path will take you there...but you also need to hike back up again. This is the tricky part, remember lots of water. You can make rest on the benches along the way...or you will rest as the view from the benches is unavoidable.

Crater Lake National Park,"I've visited Crater Lake National Park many times, and each time there's something new to discover. On Tuesday we drove down from Bend with friends, who have never been to Crater Lake. We loved the rim drive, and visited the historic inn and other buildings on the rim, but the highlight was the hike down to the lake. In all the previous visits here, my husband and I have never done this, and it was immensely rewarding. The lake is beautiful from the rim, but as you walk down the rim and get closer to the water, the color deepens in intensity, from a deep cobalt/indigo to a brilliant turquoise close to shore. When you're close you can truly appreciate how clear this water is. We were hot and a bit sore when we arrived at the boat dock, found ourselves a place to sit on rocks on the shore, and enjoyed watching the kids jumping into the water. The hike out was tough, but there are plenty of benches and stumps and rock walls to sit on or lean against while you take a breather.

From the Rim Village we took a short hike along the lake back to Discovery Point until we felt as if we had taken it all in. We also walked through the store and the lodge, and then headed back to the highway. It kind of reminded me of visiting the Grand Canyon--- it is well worth seeing, but unless you plan to spend several days there, a few hours is all that it takes.","September 18, 2012",This a must-see if you're nearby,142,"Benicia, California",5

Crater Lake National Park,"While a little out of the way, this National Park is worth going to. Crater Lake itself is an amazing site, plus there are spectacular views of the surrounding mountains on a clear day. We took a two-day Amtrak trip to Crater Lake (and Klamath Falls), so we did not have a car to get to the lake. Instead we used the Crater Lake Trolley to get up to the lake (about 1 hour ride) and to take the tour around the rim. It was outstanding. A volunteer National Park guide boarded the trolley and provided excellent information for two hours about Crater Lake, its history, and the geology. We made many stops to view the scenery and learn about prominent points. The cost of the rim tour was $22 for seniors and was worth every penny. The lodge is beautiful and worth exploring also. Although we didn't have time to hike, there are many trails of varied length and difficulty. One could easily spend a full day exploring this treasure.","September 15, 2012",Another Spectacular National Park,27,"The Villages, Florida",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Where else can you see a lake that is miles across without any outlet and is fed only by precipitation? It's a beautiful lake with spectacular steep cliffs all around. The park includes several places where the visitor can see the lake from one angle and then another. Wizard Island punctuates the view nicely. In my opinion, Crater Lake is worth visiting if you get anywhere near it in your travels.

The rim towers 1000 to 2000 feet above the snowmelt filled lake, which is on a sunny day a remarkably deep and intense blue. One may hike and drive on the rim, and even go into the caldera to fish for invasive trout the Park Service is trying to eliminate. If natural beauty attracts you, by all means go see this extraordinary scene.

We went for a great hike on a new trail to a pretty waterfall with swarms of....butterflies! It was great. One warning is we were going to hit the lodge for dinner, but it was all booked. I wanted to take our friends out, but when I checked the reviews, the few other restaurants within easy distance all had bad reviews. So, plan ahead for dinner!

There are easy hikes (Sun Notch, with perfect views of the Phantom Ship) to harder hikes (Watchman Peak, still only about 2 hours) to really challenging hikes ( which we didn't do :)!It was crowded when we visited, so taking a hike is advisable over just driving and stopping at lookouts. But either way, the views will not disappoint! We only looked and hiked, so can't say about anything else. Just a quick note - you can't swim or boat on your own in the lake. There is a ferry boat tour around the lake. Some visitors we chatted with had thought the lake was more of a recreation site. If you want to get in a lake, try Diamond Lake a few miles away.","September 4, 2012","Stunning views, excellent hikes, you should see this!",20,"Eugene, Oregon",5

The great thing about the park is that you can see it all whether you're in good physical shape or not-so-good. For those in GOOD shape, you MUST hike down to take the lake cruise, BUT: be sure to arrive 1 hour before the cruise starts to give yourself time to hike the mile down; and be sure to buy some Gatorade at the bottom before heading back up: it is 700 feet straight up and WILL take you an hour, like they advise.","September 4, 2012",Awesome,16,"austin, texas",5

We walked one and a half miles out from the visitor center and back, and in that three miles, we only saw four other people! This is one of the gems of the National Park Service.

Crater Lake National Park,"So the lake here is blue, incredibly blue, bluer than any lake in the world. That's because it's incredibly deep, so deep that it never gets much over 39 degrees. When the wind hits that water it can be quite cold so dress accordingly. The boat trip is an absolute must. The reservations, which I did not handle in truth, is a byzantine system, that involves making an electronic request. We took the trip to Wizard Island and it was well worth the time and effort. The only surprise was that the lake was quite choppy so when we hit bumps, everyone on the boat got wet, really wet. It was really quite fun.. The Rangers do a good job with the tour, although one guy struck me like he was an extra in The Shining. Food is another challenge. The Crater Lake Lodge books up months(a year) in advance. There is another option in Annie Creek which is much more basic, and a bit overpriced (though not gouging). The area is pretty remote so even if you get dinner here, you're looking at a 10-20 mile drive out of the park.The sights are really worthwhile, really quite spectacular. Bring lots of food and gas.By the way, leave your cell phone at home, there's not much reception here.","August 31, 2012","It's cold, even at the end of August!",97,"scarsdale, ny",5
Crater Lake National Park,"After an overnight stay at Klamath Falls, we headed north on SR 62 to one of the deepest, clearest, bluest lakes in the world. Would of been nice to stay at Crater Lake, but like most national parks, the lodge (on national register) and cabins book up months in advance, especially the three months of the year the area is not covered under several feet of snow. Approaching the park from the south is on a two lane blacktop road climbing up through a lot of countryside. Make sure you fill up the tank, because there are not many amenities until you reach the volcanic rim. Beautiful scenery, clean spruce-smelling air, but warm in August (hit 90 degrees when we were there). $10 admission per carload or use your golden pass. Very popular so cars get backed up at the entrance. We were traveling with our beagle and disappointed we couldn't take her on any of the trails, but dogs are allowed on one closed road and all the public areas. Beautiful views of the lake from several places along the circle rim drive, but the best are from the walkway at the rim village. Lots of events on the weekend. We had to pass several cyclists, and there were a hundred plus runners doing the loop early in the morning. Several waterfalls, one right by the east loop road. There is a boat trip on the lake that allows you time to explore Wizard island in the crater, but it takes several hours. Camping available and trams if you don't want to do the drive yourself. We took the north exit to the park and headed back on SR 138 to the I-5, also a scenic highway right along the beautiful, trout-filled North Umpqua river.","August 29, 2012",Bluer Than Sinatra's Eyes,63,"Los Angeles, California",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake, Oregon is well worth a visit. Plan a summer trip as there is a possiblity of snow through June and as early as late August. The lodge is beautiful but reservations are needed almost a year in advance. We didn't take the boat cruise because it was sold out for the time we were there, so advance reservation for the boat would be recommended as well. They told us it was quite a hike to and from the depature for the boat ride. We spent an entire day driving around the lake, pulling over at vantage points and looking at the amazing views. It was time very well spent. We easily could have spent two days. . . hiking some trails, riding the boat, and driving around the lake.

Crater Lake National Park,"We live near Crater Lake, and take friends there on a regular basis. We are proud of Oregon's only National Park - it truly is a wonder of the world. Words don't do this park justice - it is nothing short of breathtaking. Even if you don't stay at the lodge on the rim, go there for the view and take photographs. If you can, eat a meal in the lodge dining room. It is spendy, but the food is excellent and the view makes it worth it. There is a more reasonably priced eatery in the resort building with the gift shop. There are a couple of campgrounds at the park, with limited electrical hook-ups, so reserve early. There are bears in the park, so keep your food put away at night. If you're lucky you might also see a red fox, a bobcat, or other wildlife. There is abundant hiking, cross-country skiing, and exploring in Crater Lake. The rim drive will not be open in the winter, but the park is kept open and winter is a great time to see this amazing place. The snow is about 20 feet high, but they keep the viewpoints open. You must watch children and be safety conscious when visiting Crater Lake - those unfortunate souls who fall over the edge into the caldera do not generally live to tell the tale. It's not dangerous if you abide by the rules and heed the signs - STAY BACK FROM THE EDGE. ","August 26, 2012",Awe-inspiring,98,"Klamath Falls, Oregon",5
Crater Lake National Park,One of our favorite parks ever! We did the boat excursion which was fabulous! Just the right amount of information from the park ranger to make it interesting!

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake...where do I begin? It is not close to anything, it is really off the beaten path, it is not easy to plan because of the massive amounts of snow that falls there each year....yet is is an absolute ""must see""! We stayed in the Eugene/Springfield area the night before and it was still a good 3 hour trip with minimal stops so give yourself plenty of time to get there. There are some areas of beautiful scenery on the way and there are some areas that are pretty tedious. Once you reach the entrance of the national park though be prepared for breathtaking sights!We were there at the end of June. There was still quite a bit of snow on the ground in places and the plowed snow on the side of the roadway was absolutely amazing! Part of Rim Drive was still closed to traffic as they were still clearing the roadway but most of the roadway was open. We arrived on the first day that the boat rides began. We didn't take the boat as we hadn't scheduled the time and also the information that we read stated that it was a very strenuous hike back up the hill from the lake. We did see the boat operating and it looked like a very peaceful trip across the lake so if you are a hiker and in good shape, you may want to look into the boat trip if you are there during the few months that it is in operation.The first thing we noticed as we got out of our car at the first pull-off was ""nothing"". We could see the lake but you could hear absolutely nothing except the occasional bird in the distance. It was so peaceful and the lake was absolutely stunning! The blue water was the bluest blue I have ever seen and it contrasted so well with the green of the trees and the white of the snow on the ground. It was truly a photographer's dream! There are many pull-outs around the rim drive and each one offers a different view of the lake. The visitor's center is worth a stop. Restrooms are clean and offer flush toilets. There is a lodge there as well as the visitor's center itself. The visitor's center has a wonderful, large, gift shop with a cafe where you can purchase food and drinks. The prices for food are REALLY high....considering that this is the only food for miles....you either need to purchase your own snacks and take them with you or you need to suck it up and pay their prices and buy food. There was a variety of sandwiches and soups and drinks available. Plan at least 2-3 hours to drive around the lake, take photos, stop at the Visitor's Center and just enjoy this beautiful place. If you are planning on hiking or taking the boat tour you will need to plan additional time.

We travelled down the western rim and took the walk up the the Watchman - another fine view.

Good photographers are aware that the best time to shoot outdoors is early morning (not long after sunrise) and late afternoon (just before sunset). I highly recommend visiting Crater Lake during these breath-taking times of day. The lighting is slightly golden and not too bright for picture-taking. When you visit, be sure to spend time near the rim and looking down. The blue lake is emerald green and yellow near the shallower edges.

Crater Lake National Park,"We tried to reserve a camping spot but had not luck, decided to try our luck and show up to get one of the ""first come first serve"" spots. The lady at the Mazama Campground office was extremely rude and made us feel like idiots for thinking we would ever get a spot but just showing up. We decided to drive down to the Lost Creek Campground which has 16 tent only spots. It was about 11:45 on Friday morning and there were at least five spots open. Take that mean lady! For ten dollars a night it was a steal! And the campground is close to the Pinacles and one of the waterfall trails which were both awesome. The lake is so incredibly beautiful. You have to drive the entire rim and pull into each of the pull out parking areas-each time you stop it's an entirely different and beautiful view. There's always something you didn't see at the last stop.

Crater Lake National Park,"I have wanted to visit Crater Lake for years. It always seemed just a bit too far off the beaten path when zooming up and down the coast between Seattle and San Francisco. Take the time. This park is small, uncrowded, and absolutely stunning. We visited with my husband, two teenage daughters, and 4 year old son. We all loved it. We didn't have enough time to take a long hike, but we were able to absorb the grandeur from the rim and in the interpretive center that hangs off the side of a cliff. My son can recite everything about how Wizard Island was formed after Mt Mazama erupted, sank, and filled with water. I love geology, and this was a treat for me. The scenery is gorgeous. We stayed in Klamath Falls, which is about 1-1/2 hours away. Not too bad. Make the trip!","August 20, 2012",Make the trip and check it off your bucket list!,99,"Bainbridge Island, Washington",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We stayed at the Mazama camp ground from 8-6 through 8-08-2012 during a 10 day camping road trip. We are experienced campers, and were traveling as a family with a 10 yr old and a 16 yr old along. Crater Lake overall is an amazing experience, especially the Rim drive and various view points and hikes. I've been several times now, and it never disappoints. I reserved our camping site...a blue site meaning 12x12 space wise, about two months before our trip. Most of the other campsites in Oregon and Washington allowed me to pre select which sites I wanted, but Mazama did not, which was troublesome.When we arrived in the late afternoon at Crater Lake after a five hour drive from Portland, there was a significant line of people waiting to be checked into the campgrounds. We waited a very long time in line. It's probably best to check in earlier, or closer to the 12 noon check in time perhaps. We finally got our paperwork and were told to choose any open blue colored spot and put our name card over the post. This proved very challenging as many people ahead of us had already chosen sites despite it being a Monday. I can't imagine if you checked in at night or after dark, as it would be extremely challenging to find an open site in those conditions on the narrow little winding camp ground road that is often way one only. We drove around many of the loops with no success. The road here is gravel in places and very uneven so be cautious. Also children are around playing and biking as well.We finally found an open spot in G loop. G30 to be precise. We didn't love it, but were tired and ready to set up camp. It's semi secluded, but we could see our neighbors in all directions through the trees. It was a larger site at least, okay fire pit, but very uneven branch filled ground that wasn't fun to set our two tents up on. The dust here was unbelievable and got into everything and on everyone! We were constantly dirty! The bear box was fine, though very noisy to get into at night. The mosquitos weren't terrible in our opinion though we used bug sprays. None of us got bitten at this site. The walk to the bathroom from this spot was a bit far for our girls in the middle of the night. The bathrooms were alright. Not the best, not the worst. It was a bit annoying to only have one sink in a narrow place next to the stalls. Often other girls were brushing teeth, doing hair and make up routines, hogging the mirror/sink from people who just wanted to wash their hands after using the restroom. There were no nearby showers within close walking distance from this site.Our neighbors were in close proximity and it wasn't a quiet camping experience. Across the way was a large group of screaming children and toddlers. One child screamed for two hours about wanting a marsh mellow! We knew it wasn't going to be wilderness or seclusion but it wasn't peaceful much at all. There were several groups of drinking/party young people as well. Including some boys who were stripping the trees branches for kindling and wood. ugh! Mostly people put out their camp fires at a reasonable hour, but not always.We attended a sing along camp fire put on by a ranger which was pretty bad. Show a little energy and be enthused already! We like to sing and do silly camp fire events, but this wasn't fun. We weren't eager to go back the following night.This campsite is a good location for taking off for a Rim drive. It's a bit of a drive away, but if you're not staying in the lodge it seems like an alright compromise to be able to stay so nearby. The village store was convenient for a few staples we used up right away as well. We got no real cell reception or connection at all so be advised if that's an issue for you. We did experience lots of wild life around, birds, chipmunks that jumped right in our laps, butterflies and moths. That was a nice experience. All in all, I'm not sure I'd go back to this camp ground. We certainly experienced some better ones along our trip. Perhaps just a day trip as a side trip would be better next time.","August 20, 2012",Mazama Camp Ground only so-so,164,"Portland,OR",3
Crater Lake National Park,"We camped at Mazama camp grounds at Crater Lake from 8-6 through 8-8-2012. Two adults, one teen, one 10 year old. I have been to Crater Lake several times when I was a younger child, but the rest of my family had never been. We live in Portland, OR so it was definitely a long drive. We made our camp reservations well in advance as well. It's worth it to view this beautiful national treasure at least once in your life time. It was amazing to watch my children take in all the natural beauty as I once did at their ages. The water really is that blue! It is the deepest in the entire US! We did the entire rim drive, following both the auto guide provided on trip advisor and a book I already had. The auto guide on here is only so so. I really wished it had provided more specific information, but it's a good start for a beginning with no other ideas. Be advised, cell phones, no matter the carrier or service mostly don't work on the Rim drive, so be sure you've already downloaded and printed or have hard copies of any hiking or things you want to see as you won't likely have any phone reception. We actually had none our entire 3 day visit. Also, if you can, be sure to get gas before entering the park. In the summer there is one gas pump, but it's twice the price of buying gas in the last local town before you hit the park. And know that even if you're camping or staying at the Lake, there is a 10 dollar per car fee to enter the park. If you're going any other time then late summer, call ahead and find out the weather and snow conditions before you go. The rim drive is only open seasonally and really a shame to miss out on. We took an entire day to do the Rim drive. We stopped off at various view points for photo ops, picnic, snow play (yes there was some snow on the side of the road in various spots even in August). If you have a good guide, be sure it tells you how far a hike is or how strenuous. And I would advise not speeding on the narrow road up there, be patient and courteous with fellow tourists, and try not to get behind the Trolley Bus tour that runs around to the various view points. It's very slow, and then a ton of people get out and are crowding around what normally may be a quiet look out point. The phantom ship is cool to see, as well as the pinnacles. It was warm, in the 80's when we visited and not a ton of shade so wear sunscreen and bring water with you. I highly recommend going to see a sunset. We picked a great look out point and watched the sun set over the mountain peaks. It was astonishing and beautiful. The stars at night at Crater Lake are some of the most amazing I've seen any where in the world.We didn't go down to the dock and do the boats this trip. I've done it in the past. It is a nice boat ride, and you should make reservations early. And do note that people are not exaggerating the 700 foot steep climb down to the dock, which means you have to climb back up it. It's rough going and not for people who have mobility issues. But very worth it, if you've never done it before. Wizard Island is a neat stop off to explore if you can manage that as well.It's worth a visit to this spectacular lake if you're in the area.

If you like to take pictues, be mindful of where the sun is when you arrive to get the best shots. Mid morning is best from the south in my opinion. The lake is a deep blue and the steep slope of the sides of the crater meeting the water make for postcard shots from many of the many turn out vistas of the 33 mile drive.","August 18, 2012",Worth the trip,231,"Green Valley, Arizona",5

Crater Lake National Park,"We hear/read about how blue the lake is. But honestly it is hard to imagine the actual blueness! You absolutely MUST visit this National Park. You will not be disappointed. We took the boat ride around the lake. Advice.... Know what you want to do and call and reserve ahead. The rooms at the lodge book early so if you feel you want to stay there, plan 6-7 months in advance. I called 3 months ahead and only was able to get one night.Look at the boat tour. If you want to go on it, call and have them send you an email (will be about mid June) when the tours open up. Make reservations! Yes, you'll have to pre-pay. But those were also full the day we were there. We chose the 11:30 because we didn't stay in the park that night and wanted to allow plenty of time to get there. REMEMBER TO PICK UP YOUR TICKETS BEFORE THE HIKE!! It was so hot, but I think that is unusual. The walk down was no problem, but the walk up was strenuous. It took me an hour due to the heat and the steepness. The water really is an indescribable blue. There are no words to describe it. Even though the hike back to the car was strenuous, it was worth it in the end. Also, another advantage of an early reservation is parking. I was surprised at the number of people looking for parking when we were back to our car. Take plenty of water. There is a place to purchase water and some snacks before going down. And down at the boat.Another important reservation is dinner at the Lodge, should you want to eat there. Reservations are a must. If you do end up there at the last minute, you can order from the bar menu and eat in the lobby or on the porch.We were there mid August and were amazed at how many patches of snow were still around.

However, there is a very good trolley tour around the rim.","August 12, 2012",Foggy but beautiful,39,"Las Vegas, Nevada",4
Crater Lake National Park,"Approaching the volcanic mountain range from the coast, the Crater Lake National Park is a great attraction to visit. We had a perfectly sunny day with blue skies, and enjoyed the blue water of this lake. Of course it is a major tourist attraction, so be prepared for lots of traffic and people. We found seeing the lake from two or three points quite sufficient - remember, it is almost a perfect circle, so the scenary really doesn't change that much from a different point. Going from the North entry point to the main village along the west drive provides you with fine (and almost identical) views, so we decided to skip the whole drive-around the crater rim. The amount of people present was certainly another factor to stay for an hour instead of for a day....","August 12, 2012",Nice side trip from coast to central Oregon,261,"Toronto, Canada",4

Crater Lake National Park,"The lake views are awesome, and there are several good trails and about 30 lookouts. It was weird to see so much snow on the ground in July. Apparently, the lake is in a drought, as the snowfall was much less than previous years. The lake still looked fine, but a lot of the vegetation looked strained. The trails were really dusty, but thankfully not many people were there to stir up the dust. They seem to be opposed to adding any kind of guardrails along the roads or trails. There were a few place that could really benefit from them. Also, they could do a better job with signage. Many of the overlooks, such as Pumice Castle, which was really cool, were completely unmarked. The park was not as crowded as we expected it to be. There were a lot of people around the cafe and lodge, but the roads and trails weren't congested at all. We hiked on several small trails and the trail that leads to the fire watchtower. The hikes were really nice and they provided varied scenery that can't be seen from the road. I would advise that you leave your hotel pretty early, as we left at 8 from Medford and we didn't feel that we had enough time.","August 10, 2012","Very good, some signage would be nice",15,"Raleigh, NC",4
Crater Lake National Park,"The drive into the park was very nice, easy, and not overcrowded. We stayed in the Mazama Village campground which is very well layed out and well mantained. We had a site on the edge of Annie Creek which provided lovely background sounds at night. We recommend making the treck up to watchman's tower - the view of the lake is well worth it. While service at the lodge for lunch was sub-par and the fruit/cheese plate looked to be well beyond its prime the porch view and atmosphere with the rocking chairs greatly makes up for it. Though you do not need more than one full day to hit up mostly everything this park has to offer, the gorgeous lake and uncrowdedness makes this park a perfect stop while in OR.

We also drove around the rim, dinner at the lodge, frolicked a bit in the July snow, and enjoyed a beautiful sunset hike to the top of Watchman Peak. We would have liked to linger, but thoroughly enjoyed our 8-hour stay at the park.

Crater Lake National Park,"Spectacular as it is, there's more to Crater Lake than the lake itself. The east rim road, for example, takes you past Mount Scott, not only the highest point in the park but also the oldest. Stop at rim road turnouts with views to the north and south, where you'll catch glimpses of the remnants of glacial movement, pumice deserts, and the flat, flat, flat Klamath Basin. These are features that tell the larger story about the volcano that became home to Crater Lake. While you're at it, take time for a walk --short or long, it doesn't matter-- into the mountain's forested slopes. I highly recommend the 2 mile Annie's Creek walk (moderately strenuous, begins behind the ampitheatre in Mazama Campground), which takes you from a dry conifer forest down into a glaciated valley populated by wildflower-strewn meadows. With the rushing stream, it's heaven on earth. A guide available at the trail head identifies significant geological and ecological features.","August 6, 2012",There's more to Crater Lake than the lake,23,"Los Angeles, California",5

Most of the better views are those that most people will drive by so look for a place to park where only a few cars can get into and those will be some humdinger views! As for the Gift Shop/Lunch counter, gifts can be found that won't break the bank, but there's gifts in there for a song and dance too. Food at the lunch counter is way over priced but that's normal for Xanterra run places.

I would suggest going earlier in the morning since it seems that the reflection in the water is much better at this time. We arrived from the north via bend, OR and departed via the west. You may want to check if there will be any construction going on the roads to and fro the park tho. I would suggest allowing 5-6 hours for this park.

The water is beautiful. This was my second trip to Crater Lake, we visited in May 2010, a totally different experience. The amount of snow in May kept us from visiting much of the park, so we were excited to enter the north entrance this trip. It is remarkable. I highly recommend the very rewarding, but difficult climb up watchman's trail to the top of the watchtower. AMAZING views, but it is definitely a steep, tough climb. You can view the entire caldera from this vantage point.A true jewel of the Western United States and should be on everyone's bucket list.The only negative I can say about Crater Lake is that there are not enough bathroom facilities for travelers.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is one of our nation's most beautiful National Parks. It's a long road into the Park, but once there, seeing the lake for the first time is an awesome experience. First you realize you've never seen the color blue like this! Then you notice the sheer size of the crater which is incredible. The lake is over 6 miles across and 1,943 feet deep at it's deepest point. It contains 4.9 trillion gallons of water! This crater was caused by a volcanic eruption, so it is technically a caldera. The water is the result of rain and snow over thousands of years. It's just one of many Cascade Mountain Range volcanoes.Doing the 33 mile long Rim Drive and stopping at each pull-out takes between 2-3 hours, depending on how long is spent in each place. And of course, with snow at the top most, if not all of the year, we had to let our grandsons play in it for awhile. Upon entering we arrived first in Rim Village, and Park Headquarters where we talked to the Rangers and picked up some information about the park. The Ranger told us that Crater Lake averages about 44 feet of snow each winter, so the Rim Drive is closed from the middle of October to late June. When going off the main road and hiking through the woods, mosquito repellant is a must! We parked our car because the road sign pointed to a waterfall in the forest. We never did find the waterfall, but the mosquitos certainly found us. There is a large, beautiful waterfall, Vidae Falls, right on the road with a good-sized pull-off in front of it.If you're traveling the southern Oregon Coast, take a little side-trip to Crater Lake National Park.

Crater Lake National Park,"I had read several times in several places to drive the rim of Crater Lake clockwise, but it was never stated why. We obeyed the advice, not knowing why, but soon figured out why. If you drive clockwise, your car is next to the rim, not the cliff which is lacking guard rails in MANY places. Scary.

Even after visiting the National Park more than 40 times I can easily find new areas worth exploring. Most folks visit rim village, but to really see the lake visiters should take the 33 mile rim loop drive. This drive not only gives the visiter great views of the lake, but also the surrounding areas up to 200 miles away! In the park you can hike across a pumice dessert, climb a 9,000 ft volcano, swim in the deepest lake in the country, or visit the headwaters of the Rogue river in a deep green forest. There's a lot for an outdoors person to do, and the city folks seem to like it a lot also.

What a beautiful drive in and of itself and one that certainly keeps one alert with all the hairpins & twisting & turning. As we approached the crater rim near the lodge, the beauty of the lake and it's surroundings unfolded in all its splendor. The deepness of the blue in the lake was incredible and the snow caps (yes even in July) punctuated the rim around the lake.

Crater Lake National Park,"We camped at Diamond Lake which is only about 14 miles from Carter Lake with our 10 year old twins. The bugs there were horrible but I will save that for another review. We went to Crater Lake on a Monday so it wasn’t too crowed. I have been to several national parks and would have to say this was the most accessible park yet. They charge a $10 entrance fee per car. The view points are not far from each other and very easy to get to. The parking was easy also. I would not recommend traveling with an RV since there isn’t really any RV parking at the view points. They do have a trolley you can take if you don’t want to drive. If you are travelling during the summer all the roads Should be open and you can drive all the way around the crater which I would definitely recommend. If you get nervous with driving near cliffs be aware for a good portion of the drive around the lake there are cliffs right at the edge of the pavement. I was very nervous but made it through. We drove very slowly on those parts. One day is plenty of time to spend at the crater if you don’t plan to take long hikes. The mosquitoes were pretty bad so bring plenty of spray and wear long sleeves and pants. We ended up eating our picnic lunch in the car because of the bugs. We decided to take a boat tour. Since we didn’t book tickets in advance we were able to go to a kiosk at the lodge to purchase tickets. We weren’t sure if we could get tickets, but they did still have some for the same day on a late afternoon tour. The hike to the boat launch is 2.2 miles round trip with a 700 ft. elevation and is marked strenuous. This is very similar to the hike for Multnomah Falls in the Columbia Gorge, OR. You need to take into consideration the elevation and the weather for this hike at Crater Lake. I get pretty nervous with heights. Three out of four of us slipped on the way down. The trail is dirt and small rocks which makes it very slippery and dusty. We held the hands of our kids the whole way. It took us about 25 minutes to get down and about 45 to get back up. The tour cost $108 for the four of us. It was two hours long and drove very slowly around the perimeter of the lake. They have a park ranger who tells the different theories of how the lake formed on board of the tour. Most of these facts you will read at the view points and you can see nearly everything from the view points. It was a very slow tour. The kids and I were bored and ready to go after about an hour of it. You must bring plenty of water and food for this tour. The bathrooms were disgusting (out houses). I would bring some TP with you just in case. I could have lived without this tour. I would not recommend this excursion to families with children 10 or younger. Driving around the crater and stopping at the view points was good enough for me. The lake is beautiful and I was able to get some gorgeous pictures.","July 26, 2012",Beautiful- Must See,20,West Coast,5

It snowed the entire time and the lake was lost in a fog of mist. We still had a wonderful time, and this is a beautiful national park that is well worth a visit. We stayed at the Annie Springs site 7 miles below the rim, in a cabin, and found it spacious and warm. Cabins are managed by Xanterra, contracted to the park service, and they are spare by comfortable: 2 comfortable queen beds, lots of blankets, no TV or phone, but there is a big bathroom and a coffee maker. The interpretive center is good with films about the formation and discovery of Crater Lake and also about the snow plowing of the area, surprisingly interesting.","July 26, 2012",Check the weather for the season you want to go!,26,"Portland, Oregon",5
Crater Lake National Park,"National parks are one of the reasons I travel all over the US. I have been to 1/3 of them already and each is unique in it's own way; Crater Lake is no exception. However, unlike some of the other parks, there is not really a lot to do besides look at the lake. Yes, there are hiking trails and The Pinnacles area, and the boat ride, but the main attraction is the lake.We were there in late July and even though at 7100 ft elevation, it was well into the upper 80's temp on the rim and probably much hotter on the boat ride, which we did not do. The boat ride is at least a 4 hour activity and a very strenuous adventure. It is a mile walk down 700 ft to the lake, followed by a 2 hour boat ride, and then a strenuous mile hike up the same trail. If you are not use to hiking in high elevation and it is hot, it will be very difficult. There is no shade on the trail. The rim drive goes around the lake and is mixed bag. Most of the year it is not open and when it is, the seasonal part is rough. It does allow different vantage points, but in my opinion, unless there is strong desire to do, most of the experience can had by driving the section from Phantom Ship overlook, past the lodge area to the junction where the north entrance meets the rim drive.There are National Parks that are what I call ""Destination"" parks, where you can spend days in them and still not see everything. My opinion is that Crater Lake is not one of these. While it is unique and stunningly beautiful, it's a day trip park. You can get 80% of the experience in hour, 90% in 2-3 h, and 100% in a long day (boat ride, full rim drive). If driving between Medford, OR and Eugene, OR, it is definitely worth the 4+ hour side trip to see.I would like to maybe come back in winter and see the lake, but won't make a special trip to Oregon to do.My review is not meant to be negative. Crater Lake is absolutely beautiful and unique and shouldn't be missed. I just don't think you need to spend multiple days to get the experience.","July 26, 2012","Awesome Beauty, but old quick",87,"Boston, Massachusetts",3

We spent two glorious days there (NOT enough!), walking around the scenic area by the main lodge, visiting the lower Overlook Point, where we had a closer look of the lake and learned a lot from the ranger's informative, interesting talk about the lake. - We also drove along the beautiful rim shoreline, making numerous scenic stops to enjoy the beauty of the lake from different vantage points; its surrounding mountains, waterfalls, e.g., the gigantic Vidae Waterfall! There are many enjoyable hiking trails of different ability levels, too.- Even though we knew darn well that pictures really cannot do justice to the magnificent, natural beauty, we still could not help ourselves but taking countless pics of the lake, almost at every 10 yards!In mid-July, there was still snow blocking some sections of the shoreline rim drive, even though the air temperature was in high 70s! We did manage to cover most of the accessible East and West Rim.- Wish we were able to stay longer to enjoy Crater Lake, but almost all lodging within 60min drive were booked solid! Fortunately, we were able to book 3 nights at the Running-Y Golf Resort (Holiday Inn) in Klamath Fall, some 45min drive away! By the way, that place is a gorgeous, relaxing resort, quite popular for fishing, too, besides golf!- In this trip, we were not able to book the most popular boat ride, however, much to our disappointment.

It is important to check on the nps site for crater lake about the snow conditions if you plan on going outside of July - October.The lake is spectacular a near perfect circle with steep screes and cliffs falling down to the waters edge. Be aware you are up at over 7000 ft on the rim and at times even higher, so it can be quite nippy even in the summer, take a fleece or light jacket with you, you'll put it on.When we dirst got there it was still a little cloudy and my first view if the lake was, if I'm honest, a bit dissapointing. It looked dull and grey, even thou the setting was still impressive.Then the sun broke though and blue sky appeared, as if by magic the lake became this amazing blue colour that yu see in the tourist brochure photographs. At one point where the law was still half under clouds there was dividing line across the lake from grey to blue.So my point is this, see Crater Lake on a sunny day then the view is amazing.Sme of the views tothe South of the Cascades are pretty cool too, it's so clear you can see the Three Sisters, Mt Thielsen, Diamond Peak, Mt Bailey and others.","July 24, 2012",Weather is everything at Crater Lake in good weather it is jaw dropping,27,"Plano, Texas",5

Crater Lake National Park,"I went to beautiful and scenic crater lake to camp in June. It was very sunny but the temperature was just above freezing and the campground had three feet of snow, and i arrived at 830pm, so I decided not to camp and stayed in the $170 (overpriced, but it is a national park and someone has to pay to plow the roads) manassas village lodge. It was clean and very basic with no tv, radio, coffee, candy, water, magazines, or anything to suggest hospitality or comfort. Like a large outhouse with a bed in it. There was a ticking baseboard heater that was welcome on the cool evening in June that i stayed there. Unfortunately the smoke detector outside the room beeped and alarmed every 5 minutes all night, and i was unarmed. I decided to walk to the beautiful log cabin village restaurant for breakfast as a treat to start my day. I ordered a poached egg and it came on a white plate, all alone, cold and slimey and raw. After I gagged that down I ordered a nice warm ""home made"" cinnamon bun from the huge open gourmet kitchen that i could see and hear was staffed by a whole line of blue ribbon chefs. Over the banter of the line chefs and orders I heard the beeping of a microwave oven, but tried to remain optimistic. Eventually a plate arrived bearing a microwaved ""heat and eat"" premade bun that was dry outside, cold an dgoopy inside, and coated with weepy white icing from a tube. I was saddened, but even more so when I got my bill and saw the bun alone was $7. Tv chef ramsay would have asked them to turn in their aprons.","July 18, 2012",winter in June,6,Vancouver,4
Crater Lake National Park,"Spent two nights at the lodge and was very fortunate to get a lake side room. The views of the lake are incredible on a good day and if you leave the curtains open the sun will give you a beautiful sun rise and sun set. The lodge was totally rebuilt in the 90's and is very welcoming and comfortable. Be advised the lodge is the only place to stay next to the lake for the 24 hour experience. Back down the hill there are cabins and camping but definitely not the experience you get with the lodge. We ate one night in the dining room and were very pleased with the meal and the service. The second night we ate in the Great Hall. There is a separate menu for the Hall and the outside veranda (rocking chairs provided) and for those not wanting the dining room, or could not get a reservation, this is a great option. Overall, one of the must sees and especially plan ahead and stay at the lodge.","July 17, 2012",Best Spot to Enjoy the View,24,"Sacramento, California",5

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake was one of those places I'd always wanted to go to -- and somehow never made it! So we make a special trip there on the way to Canada -- and it was truly awesome. When you get the the Visitor Center at the south rim, you finally get to see the lake itself and the incredible cobalt blue water. It's a color seldom seen in nature. Combine that with the setting in the crater of a volcano and it's a world-class sight to behold.It's a little off the beaten path -- but well worth it!","July 16, 2012",This should be on your Bucket List,60,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Because of the elevation parts of the road are still blocked by snow even into June and July. This time around the East Rim was still blocked by snow but the entirety of the West Rim was open. It's pretty cool to go from pull off to pull off to see how your view of the lake changes. If you go early in the morning you will run into deer so keep an eye out on the roads. At the view points you can see fresh deer prints, and for us the deer themselves were often just on the edge of the woods on the opposite side of the road.","July 15, 2012",Possible to do in a short time - but worth taking extra.,99,"South Bend, Indiana",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake National Park is THE National Park in Oregon. You can stay and relax at the lodge for an amazing experience if you book well in advance, or you can camp in the park. (We camped.) But don't be afraid to just make it a day trip. It is definitely possible as a day trip from Bend, Grants Pass or the like. Even transiting on I-5, taking a few extra hours out of your route to see the lake is worth it. While the full loop is nice, you can get a lot just by driving the north-south route that borders the lake. Visit the lodge area, and a few turnouts, then be on your way as you need. As well, if you have the time, schedule and take the lake boat tour. It is about 2 hours on a boat, touring around the lake and seeing things you cannot see from the crater wall. The hike to the boat is not easy - 1.1 miles, 700+ feet elevation. Think of climbing the stairs in a 65 story building. But take it slow if you need to. But if you do have the time, there is a lot to be seen on trials and it would be easy to spend several days soaking up the place. Any time the road to the lodge is open, it is worth seeing.","July 15, 2012",Impressive - Easy to see in a day (though you could stay longer),218,Left Coast,5

This time, on a blue sky day, we drove to the rim of the crater and stood in awe. The color of the lake is indescribable. The surrounding cliffs, rock outcroppings, and gnarly trees add to the other-worldly feeling of this National Park. We shared picture-taking duties with various visitors from around the world taking in the view of Wizard Island and the lake. Before we headed north, we also took a walk through the lodge and were impressed by the homey decor and perfect setting.

Crater Lake National Park,At the end of May we needed shades for our eyes from the bright reflection on the snow. And now that a month has passed almost all the snow blocking the view has melted down. One activity for the kids with the ranger was to learn how nature created Crater Lake as we know it today. The kids piled some dark sand on top of the balloon and POPPED IT. And where the balloon had been sanked in the ground the rain water with snow has filled it up. With melting snow what kid can't help but get into the melted water and go spalshing about. So when their feet were mostly wet it so happened that a storytime was going on. While the ranger was reading to the kids Crater Lake was in the background. And both kids earned their first Junior Ranger Patch!,"July 12, 2012",A day out for hands getting messy and maybe feet too!,5,"Jacksonville, Oregon",5
Crater Lake National Park,On our road trip through Oregon we booked reservations for the boat tour. They warn you that you must hike a mile down and back up along a dusty dirt trail to get to the boat ramp. It was very warm (85 degrees) and the elevation is around 6100 ft. The tour was a bit too long and pretty boring. The park ranger needs to spice up the tour as many were falling asleep. Then the (we call it the death march) very strenuous hike back up. I thought my husband was going to have a heart attack. So be warned it may not be worth the 4 hours it will take to take this side tour. ,"July 12, 2012",Beautiful sapphire blue water..well worth the stop but skip the boat tour.,6,San Francisco,4
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is absolutely stunning. The rim drive has plenty of overviews where you can stop for pictures or to just admire the view. The water has so many varying shades of blue and the lake's surface reflects the peaks and crater rim perfectly. Even now in mid July, the rim drive is not completely open due to snow. (It's run for kids to have snowball fights in the summer though.) the view from Crater Lake Lodge's back patio is a picture postcard. You can get a micro-brew or glass of OR wine to enjoy while you sit in one of the rockers outside. We did not do the boat tour, but I think it would have been great. The rangers describe the hike to the boat launch as ""one mile down and ten miles back up"" so be prepared. Also, you will need to make reservations ahead of time if you are just doing a one day trip.

Crater Lake National Park,"It's out of the way and a bit of a drive from everywhere, but definitely worth it (we drove from Bandon to Crater Lake and then from the lake to Eugene in one day and thought it was definitely worth the drive). Probably one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. The water is so blue and the views are just magnificent.One thing to be aware of is they get A LOT of snow there (over 44 feet a year), so the drive around the rim is closed or only partially open until mid-July. We went on July 4, and while the West Rim Drive was fully open, the East Rim Drive was partially closed since they had 8 inches of snow the week before. If you can call or look online in advance, or plan your trip from mid-July to August that would probably help.It's $10 per car to enter, but that's not much of a price to pay to experience nature like this. There are also some amazing views of neighboring mountains in the Ring of Fire. The food for purchase at the visitors' center isn't cheap and isn't anything to write home about, but you don't come for the food.

Most everyone said the trolley tour was about the same as driving around, so didn't do it. Had a great time at our pace. Everyone had a great time, but the adults and the oldest kids really loved it.

Crater Lake National Park,"Before our recent trip to Crater Lake I tried to find reviews online to determine if the boat tour was worth the effort and expense (adults $32, kids $22). I couldn't find much info, so I decided to add my own here now that we did it. Crater Lake itself is an amazing natural wonder of course, but the boat tour itself is a mixed bag. Overall, I'd rate it a 6 on scale of 1 to 10. Here's what you need to know.The tour takes 2 hours and goes around the entire perimeter of the lake at a bit too leisurely pace. The park service guide we had did a nice job explaining the park's natural history (most of which you've probably heard already at the Visitor's Center) and pointing out perhaps a dozen features. The water level view does provide a unique perspective, plus you can see upclose just how fantastically colorful and clear the water is (its one of the cleanest lakes in the world with stunning underwater visibility). The ranger will point out a few sights not viewable from the rim and it is very nice to see some, like Phantom Ship, up close. You can even opt to spend a few hours on Wizard Island, but that didn't seem like it would be much fun frankly. And while down at the boat docks you can also jump in the frigid water which is the only place to do so on the lake. The hike down takes a while - leave yourself at least 30 minutes and be warned the boats leave promptly. But the hike back up could be too much for weary kids and the elderly. The well maintained gravel trail, which is smooth and wide, traverses the side of the crater in about a dozen long switchbacks. It can be hot in the sun and cold if windy. Also be advised that the trail head itself is about a 20 minute drive from the lodge. In short, the boat tour can eat up most of a day and leave you pretty wiped out.However, there's one important point to consider ... the rim road and some hiking trails may not be accessible depending upon when you visit the park (the rim road often doesn't open entirely until late July due to snow pack). So the boat tour can give you something to do other than admire the lake from its many view points - which most folks would find sufficient in a 24 hour visit. But if you decide to go, it pays to plan ahead. The boat tours can sell out in advance particularly for busy weekends. Bring sun screen, a hat, water, a snack, and possibly your swim suit if you are adventurous. Oh, and bring something to sit on, like a fleece jacket, because the plastic boat seats are a bit hard to take for 2 hours.","July 9, 2012",Crater Lake Boat Tour: Worth the trouble and expense?,135,"San Antonio, Texas",4

Crater Lake National Park,"We traveled to Crater Lake with our three children in July 2011. Crater Lake is stunningly beautiful, but you don't see the whole thing unless you go inside. We took a boat tour --if you can't do the boat tour at least walk down the Cleetwood Trail to the shore of the lake. The tour was great, but very hot -- bring a hat and even an umbrella. My kids got bored and overheated by the end. The best part of the whole trip was jumping into Crater Lake from a big rock near the boat dock. The water is unbelievably cold, just takes you breath away. The only downside to our trip was the mosquitoes. The snowpack was so huge in 2011 that there were snow all over the place--some of the picnic tables near the rim were buried beneath snow. All that melting snow = mosquito breeding grounds. The mosquitoes were worse in the campground and on trails away from the lake. Near the lake they were not as bad. You don't need to spend a lot of time here.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is not just a ""lake."". It is impossible to describe to anyone who has never been. Just GO, but save your trip to late August or early September, the perfect time is just after Labor Day when kids are back in school if you want less crowds (it will still be crowded.). Most people don't stay here long because it seems there is nothing to ""do"", meaning this is not a lake resort, it is a visual and sensory spectacular event, a place to return to yourself, if you give yourself the time to slow down and discover the area. If you want the best, stay in the Crater Lake Lodge, but you'll need to reserve far in advance to get a lake view room (the only kind worth the $$$, it isn't cheap.). Stay on the top floor in one of the claw foot bathtub rooms. A warning- no TV, nothing but the view. They do have wi-fi now, but if you have an iPhone, no service- Verizon usually works. But the idea is to unplug! Take the hike to the top of the ranger station at Hillman Peak. Drive down to the Pinnacles. Drive the rim drive and stop along the way. Take the boat tour only if you are in good physical condition - the hike back up is very challenging. The same with the boat ride and optional hike up to the top of Wizard Island. For your first time, do it all- the ranger talks, etc. Even if you are not staying at the lodge, wander into the fireplace lounge early and grab a seat by the fireplace or on a sofa. After 3pm they serve drinks and food there, and you can curl up and read for hours. Or weather permitting, go out on the veranda and snap up one of the coveted rockers to view the lake and hang out- again, they will serve you there after 3pm. The lodge staff are from many different countries and many of them are friendly and great stories abound. Dinner or lunch at the lodge is also a treat in the dining room, but call in advance to make reservations for dinner as it is very popular. This need intensifies as the summer months go on. Really, the lake is only in tourable mode between mid-July and mid-September. I was just ther in early June and there was 6 feet of snow and at times you couldn't see the lake, it was snowing so much. Ther are a number of places to stay within 30 minutes, just outside of the lake, but choose carefully, as many places capitalize on the lake as a destination and aren't as they claim.You can camp there but the Mazama Campgound is a zoo- sites are too close together and too many kids,it is noisy and unimpressive. I've never tried the cabins but reserve well in advance. There are many trails to walk but walking inside or outside the Caldera (the crater) walls is illegal. Crater Lake National Park is a highly protected area, and they are rabid about not letting progress intrude, thankfully. Unfortunatly,, Xanterra Resorts has taken over the management so the front desk and reservation process has lost the personal feel of years ago. I am a native Oregonion, living in California for many years now, but Crater Lake is where my heart lives. There is a true wildness about it, that if you can get away from the tourism aspect and the quickee, motor home types who just stop briefly, you can make it your own. It is worth a stay, if you long for a reprieve from the busy, tech-filled life most of us lead. It is the site of a massive geological event, that feels and looks as if that event just happened. Respect it's wildness, savor its beauty, and you wil need to return.","June 10, 2012",It is the Eighth Wonder of the World- Sacred!,92,"Marin County, California",5

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake National Park is a ""can't miss” natural wonder if you visit Oregon. The NP is only a five hour drive south from Portland.The lake is 5 by 6 miles (8 by 10 km) across with a maximum depth of 1,932 feet (655 m). Crater Lake is the deepest among all lakes in the US and seventh worldwide, the surface elevation is 6,178 ft (1,883 m). The caldera rim of Crater Lake ranges in elevation from 7,000 to 8,000 feet (2.100 to 2.400 m).Crater Lake is stunning – dark blue, never freezing over in winter and ringed by snow-topped mountains in summer, two picturesque islands, multicolored cliffs studded with thousands of evergreen trees and a breathtaking sight from the rim. Nowhere in the world one would see water bluer than at Crater Lake, that’s because of its altitude and the way water is kept here. The awe-inspiring blue color results from the interaction of sunlight and water molecules. Other colors of the spectrum are absorbed, but blue penetrates to greatest depth. In 1997, scientists recorded a record clarity of 142 ft. (43,3 meters).Crater Lake is a spectacular manifestation of forces which continue to shape the earth, the lake furnishes compelling testimony of how volcanic activity built a mountain and then destroyed it through cataclysmic eruption. Much of what remained collapsed to form a caldera, and then filled with water to become a almost circular caldera lake.","May 25, 2012",One of the prettiest lakes on earth,1310,"Voecklabruck, Austria",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We live relatively close to the park and yet seem to take it for granted. It is a spectacular work ofnature. It is absolutely breath taking.

Most everything and the Rim Drive were still closed for the winter and covered in several feet of snow - Rim Village is at 7,100 feet so it gets a lot of snow. The lake was mostly still frozen over. It looked like great winter hiking, snowshoeing and cross country skiing. The visitor’s center was open and you could get to the rim and see the crater and lake. Quite amazing views but probably better with a clear blue sky to really appreciate the color of the lake. The difference between four stars and five stars. Nice little café and gift shop.

Great place for a family outing!","May 14, 2012",And how was it formed?,14,"Lincoln City, Oregon",5
Crater Lake National Park,"On the day we visited Crater Lake we were told helpfully by the Ranger that we were to expect fog. Boy did she mean it! We had clear sailing all the way through the park up until we got to the rim. At the first pull-off we got out of the car and my husband and I were losing each other in the parking lot. We walked up to the informational sign and looked out and saw. . .nothing but a thick coat of fog - no sign of the lake anywhere. Having not forgotten our sense of humor, we snapped a few pictures of the nothingness and of my husband disappearing into the thickness of the fog. The drive on the rim road was treacherous. The temperature was hoving at the freezing point making the road slick and the fog made oncoming cars anybody's guess. Let's not even talk about the harrowing drops and lack of guardrails along much of the rim road. Somehow, we made our way to Crater Lake Lodge. Decidedly optimistic, we thought that a few hours spend in the lodge would scare the fog away. We enjoyed a lovely lunch in the Crater Lake lodge which, despite the fireplace, was cold on this day. The lunch was good and I don't recall feeling it was overpriced. We walked back out to the rim and for the briefest of moments we caught a glimpse of Wizard Island. Unfortunately, we never did get to appreciate the lake's clear blue depths. It wasn't meant to be for us. Don't forget to note the poles used to outline the parking lot and the height of the road signs due to the incredible amount of snow that falls here each year. My review would have almost certainly been 5 star if the fog would have cooperated!","May 14, 2012",The vistas were . . . foggy,27,New York,4

At the Park take a lot of pictures of the lake which is in an extinct volcano, where the visibility is approx. 1500 feet down.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake National Park is a not-to-be-missed natural wonder in Southern Oregon.

Check the National Park website to see what the weather, road and visibility conditions are before traveling as you have a 50-50 chance of actually seeing the Lake during the winter. There are free Ranger-led snowshoe walks on weekends and the equipment is lent at no charge. As the seasons progress, the Lake turns from a deep blue to sapphire and the snow recedes on the mountains, making it possible (around early July) to drive round the 33-mile perimeter. There are several roadside parking areas for photo taking, hiking and enjoying a picnic. For the athletes, there is a marathon each August.The Lodge on the Crater Rim is a beautiful place to sip a hot beverage or enjoy wine while on the rocking chairs on the lake-facing patio. Gather inside around the massive fireplaces and enjoy a delicious meal in the dining room.We are tent campers, but there are many spots for RVs too.

Would love to visit again as I missed the boating tour last time.","December 16, 2011",Awesome views,5,"Seattle, Washington",4
Crater Lake National Park,"I will be in the minority of the reviewers by rating this attraction rather low and it could be because of the time when I visited the park. The 3-4 hour drive on icy roads was tiring. The only place that was open to see the lake was the little stretch of the road just past the Rim Village Visitor Center/Cafe. Both sides of the rim road were closed and I knew that, I just hoped there would be more to see from what was open. The open road had high ridges of plowed snow, making it hard to see much. It is a pretty lake and beautiful mountains, no question about it but coming from the land of 10,000 lakes (and plenty of ice and snow), it felt like more of the same, just much harder to get to. Perhaps the experience would be different in the summer and I wonder if the park is worth keeping open in the winter.","December 8, 2011",Disappointed,59,"Kenosha, Wisconsin",3
Crater Lake National Park,"as stated above, the short distance we were allowed( 8 miles) was beautiful but, it sure would have been something to travel around the crater.

Crater Lake National Park,"Anyone contemplating visiting Crater Lake should definitely consider staying at the Lodge. Also, be sure to take the two hour guided trolley tour around the perimeter of the Lake. It is well worth your time and money. There are plenty of stops along the way the ranger explains many details about the area. The Lodge is fantastic and well as the food. The best prepared food you will receive in a most inviting, warm and rustic atmosphere. You will enjoy the long porch with rocking chairs and blankets to sit and enjoy the view of Crater Lake. We wish we could have stayed two nights as there is a lot to enjoy in the immediate area and on the way out of the park there are hot springs. We found out about this after we left the area.

We were naive and didn't know fog is common in the Fall and you can't see anything but the rim road you are driving on if there's fog present and that's no exaggeration. No water, no mountains, no scenery, no nothing but fog.I still gave the lake an excellent rating since pictures show it would be a beautiful sight if you could see it, but call ahead if it's overcast or looks like fog may be in the area.

The rim road is 32 miles long and well worth completing. The views all round are wonderful. The staff at the visitor centres, however, were not as well informed as I would have wished and the Rim Cafe only offered a limited range of food - but this maybe because my visit was in mid October. Being so late in the season meant fewer crowds but closed campsites and a store with limited stock. The scenery is, however, worth a long detour to see.

Much of it is closed off during the winter so the best time to go is summer/fall. Weren't too impressed with the lodge and gift shop. It's okay.

Crater Lake National Park,"I have been this park twice before -- once when the snow banks were so deep we could not see the marker poles on the sides of the road. I've been there in the summer when the park and lodge were humming with tourists. But the fall - wow! The sky was a bright and beautiful blue with streaks of white clouds and the water -- a magnificent blue deeper than the sky. The trek down to the water's edge not as steep as I'd feared. The water is ice cold - breathtaking! And what can a person say about the Crater Lake Lodge? Elegant? Magnificent? Breathtaking views mixed with old world mountain charm? I traveled with my husband and another couple and their friend. The five of us had breakfast in the dining room. I had trout with a potato ensemble that was mouth melting wonderful! My husband was disappointed they were out of oatmeal but he thoroughly enjoyed his omelet. Everyone commented on how great their meals were. Just note that dinner is VERY expensive! My husband and I did not rent a room at the Lodge as it was beyond our budget. I asked our companions how their rooms were. One person's comment was ""the dining room is great!"". Don't know what that meant. Their companion just smiled.Crater Lake is the deepest lake in North America and is one of the natural wonders of the world. Please take advantage of one of the few pristine places left in our country and visit - it's worth every penny you spend for the entry fee to the park. If you have reservations at the Lodge this park fee is only paid once for the duration of your stay. I have a Golden Pass because I'm disabled. Anyone who is disabled or is age 62 or older can get one which admits anyone into a national park for free.

It's waters, viewed from the rim of the giant caldera--an island in the middle is actually a stillborn volcano--looks both Alaskan and Caribbean. As part of our cross country drive, it was the next stop (2 days later) after Yellowstone. Crater Lake is also a national park ($10 fee to enter, but we had the Nat'l park pass) that was like dessert compared to its far larger Wyoming neighbor, but it holds up to anything there in terms of its sheer beauty.

We ran out of time and did not have time to do the hike down to the water and back.As we were not sure about the availability of food or how crowded it would be, we brought a picnic to eat at the rim. We were quickly joined by a dozen hearty chipmunks. Food was available at the lodge but was expensive and the dining area crowded.

By all means plan to stop and eat at the lodge even if you aren't staying there. The food was wonderful and the service impecable even though they were very busy. We didn't get to do the boat ride down on the lake but another time I think we would get that worked into our schedule. There were fees for some activities (boat ride, trolley) but I can't remember if we paid a few to just enter the park if so it was minimal for what we got out of the experience.","September 18, 2011","Mind blowing color, views, drive, and food.",12,Crystal Lake,5

The restaurant at the Crater Lake Lodge is also expensive ($20 for a nice side salad, as I remember), and if you are a day visitor, you cannot be seated or served until all the folks lodging there have been served.

Also, the gas station up at the visitor centre only sells regular gasoline, so be sure you fill up well before you head up into the Park!! (I say because we got part way up and realized we had insufficient gas to do the trip, so we wasted an hour or so of our day heading back down and refuelling).The drive up there is very pleasant, but at times unremarkable There is a spot part way up where you can camp and there was some very picturesque little rapids in a small river that was roaring through.Once up at the top, there is a fee to get into the park area, then you're off. The views are absolutely breathtaking, and the drive up there with it's many hairpin turns should be negotiated with respect to the road. There is at least one spot where we stopped for photos and noticed the whiskey jacks and chipmunks were coming up the little wall beside the parking lot and taking peanuts, etc. off the visitors. Irresistable, I'm afraid! A ways up the road close to Wizard Island is a parking area where you can get out and take a trail up to the watchtower, which is an active fire-watch station. The hike is a bit steep, but not too bad...about 20 minutes up and 15 back. Be careful if you are hiking up over any snowy areas as it can be slippery. The view from the tower is completely worth the hike.We wish we would have had all the time necessary to make a complete circuit by car, leave yourselves lots of time to fully enjoy this beautiful Oregon treasure.

Until yesterday, I had only added one place to that list (Yellowstone in autumn). Now add Crater Lake National Park to that very short list. We went with a friend who does ski patrol there in the winter and who kept apologizing for the poor viewing conditions. Wildfires were blowing a layer of smoke into the park and hazing over what she claims is a perfect blue and clear sky normally. early in our tour around the rim (about 33 miles) we caught a vista before the smoke had reached the lake and we caught a glimpse of what she was talking about. The water below shimmered varying shades of blue and green and the almost still waters reflected the puffy clouds overhead. It was absolutely incredible. If you are ever anywhere near northern California or Southern Oregon, plan on going to Crater Lake. The story of how it formed (short video at the visitor center) is amazing all by itself.

You can take a boat tour across the lake - but the stairs down looked really steep and I chickened out.

We spoke to a few couples who had stayed at the lodge. They said it was first day in four the weather had cleared. Snow prevented the full circle drive around the lake, and the boat trip to Wizard Island was not operating. The day before, a careless tourist in sneakers walked away from the prescribed path to take a picture, slid down the embankment, and had to be evacuated by helicopter.When you go in the summer,when the north entracne is open, try to take the beautiful Route 138 from I5, and take time to see the waterfalls.","September 12, 2011",Spectacular Views - but Watch the Weather Forecast!,99,"Portland, Oregon",5

Take the rim drive slowly, stop at all the pull-offs. Each angle is a different view and brings new surprises, even just 25 yards further along the rim. Get out of the car. Soak in the amazing geological history. We took the time to hike down Cleetwood trail and take the 2 hour boat trip around the lake. The climb is not easy, but we are middle aged and took our time. It is well worth it. The views from the lake level give a whole new view of the geology. The US National Park Service Guide was a fountain of knowledge and taught us fascinating things about the Crater and its history. She pointed out many formations and explained their meaning. Next time we will explore some of the trails to wonders surrounding the caldera. There are many short hikes to amazing places....next time.Dinner or drinks and snacks at the lodge is a great way to end the day.

Crater Lake National Park,"We drove around the Rim Drive. there are hundreds of pullovers for jaw dropping views. It is a little steep with sharp turns, but it is very easy compared to the ones we drove in Rocky Mountain or Olympic National Parks.We camped in the Mazama campground. We had booked a trailer camp spot, and it was enough space for our 2 cars and two tents. There were tents nearby everywhere , but the trees in our campsite helped to set up a secluded feeling (not all campsites were same). we were in the D loop. Even when we had booked earlier online, we were given a color on our arrival. We had to drive through all the loops to choose a campsite of our color and choice. It was a little waste of time. But otherwise, the experience was very nice, there were clean toilets, and no bugs and there were plenty of dry wood to use for the fire.We also did the Cleetwood Cove hike. This was the only trail which took us to the level of the lake where we could touch the water. It is a steep trail alright with about 25 feet elevation. The tough factor was total downhill going down, and total uphilll while coming back. There are benches along the trail to rest. Most of it is shaded by the trees naturally.

Crater Lake National Park,"The bluest of blue immensity that is Crater Lake bravely dares you not to be inspired by nature's handiwork. This lake is the deepest in the US and is indeed jaw-dropping. It's fun, albeit pricey, to take the boat tour and/or the trolley tour. However, they are not necessary to fulfill the trip to Crater Lake. Taking the rim drive and viewing it from all angles is quite a thrill in itself. The kid in you will especially enjoy anticipating the first sight of Phantom Ship and Wizard Island -- and the snow still adamant on the mountain sides and lapping at the Lake's edge like foam. The quick drive out to see the Pinnacles is also worthwhile, as are the hikes to waterfalls and wildflowers gardens (which already begin heavy retiring in late August). Less impressive are the visitor centers, Rim and Steel, which are on the small side, although we always enjoy browsing the bookshops. The intro film was appropriate, but lost some of the deserved majesty by being played on a small screen. Restrooms were available and clean. We found the Rangers to be less enthusiastic than those at other major national parks.The campground looks inviting, with plenty of shade and space for both tents and rv's. If you want to lodge it, make reservations well in advance. As of this writing, there is a fee for entrance to Crater Lake, and an identifical fee for entrance to Lava Beds NM in Cali. For the same combined price, you can obtain a year-long pass to both.

We drove around the rim & did the boat tour which we would recommend as long as you are physically able to do the hike in & out (climbing out is equal to going up 65 flights of steps--it wasn't really that bad if you take it slow). The boat tour was educational & we got some great pictures. It lasts about 2 hours.Some of our favorite hikes included: Castle Crest (tons of wildflowers--really beautiful), Watchman Peak (uphill but awesome views & not very long), Plaikni Falls (wildflowers & lovely waterfall at the end), Annie Creek (tiring but beautiful & changing scenery).

Upon arrival to the lake the holders of confirmed reservations still will have to stand in a line to get an actual tickets2) Inefficient ticketing and boarding procedures onsite; a chatty girl in the ticket booth who seemed to enjoy having long small-talk conversations with patrons, thus making a long wait even longer.","September 4, 2011","Loved Boat cruise, hated their ticketing procedures",31,"San Francisco, California",4

Crater Lake National Park,"We stopped at Crater Lake on a cross country move. We had some time before we needed to be in our new location so we decided to sight see along the way. I had wanted to see Crater Lake for a while, and it didn't disappointment me. Its absolutely beautiful, with breath taking views. Plus, I am fascinated by volcanoes and to me it was really interesting to imagine what the area was like, before a giant volcanic crater appeared. It just makes it more interesting to me when I'm able to really understand what I am looking at and why its there. So between the beautiful scenery and the geologic history, I thoroughly enjoyed this park. My only complaint is that the visitor's centers closed fairly early for summer time. Both visitor's centers closed at 5:00pm, and while I realize that's a normal time to end a work day, it was kind of disappointing when we showed up at 5:30 and they were closed. My husband and I have national park passports that we stamp at each park, so we were unable to get ours stamped here. In our experiences traveling, most national park visitor's centers stay open until at least 6, and many stay open longer, during the summer months. However, since this was just a brief stop during a move, we would have had plenty of time to stop in and get our books stamped if we had actually made this trip a full day trip.","August 29, 2011",Beautiful!,186,"Staunton, Virginia",4
Crater Lake National Park,"This is a beautiful place. We did the boat tour in the lake. It takes about an hour to drive to the place once you get to the park, so allow plenty of time. We were rushed. Once you get there, you need to walk down a hugh hill. Going down isn't a problem. The boat tour is good, but not great. There is a ranger on the boat that tells you all about he lake. You could get the same thing from the tour up top, and it would take 2 hours. The hike up afterwards is very challenging. I think that it is worth doing if you are in shape and not in a rush. I think it was about $29 per person.","August 27, 2011",Beautiful Place,5,"Ladera Ranch, California",4
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is one of the most impressive natural lakes that I've seen (others include those in Bali, Japan & Philippines).

Crater Lake National Park,"Photos don't do this place justice...it is a jaw-dropping experience. A visit there had been on our bucket list for ages so we were super excited to go. We decided to go on a weekday rather than over the weekend, in the hope that it wouldn't be too crowded. Definitely recommended.We approached from the north side and drove anti-clockwise on the Rim Road. There are plenty of pull-outs for photo opps. all around the Lake. We also visited Rim Village, which was pretty crowded and as we wanted to do the Rim Road justice we didn't stay there too long. The Steel Visitor Centre was also very good, great publications for sale.We decided to drive to the Pinnacles, a little side trip on the eastern side. Interesting but we wish we'd spent more time on the Rim Road instead. Sadly the Cloudcap Overlook was closed - the highest overlook off the Rim Road.We spent 6hrs or so there but it was not enough for us. We will just have to go back!","August 19, 2011",A day to remember for ever,126,"Vancouver, Canada",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Having driven through Yellowstone, Grand Canyon, Zion, etc., we expected great views but lots of traffic. We had the great views, but never had any problems with traffic. Pulling out for the overlooks and getting back on the highway was always effortless. We had stayed away from Crater as we always heard that due to the short season it is open, crowds were common. Not on the Thursday we were there. The only crowded situation we encountered was parking to visit the lodge. The lodge itself had plenty of visitors, but was not packed with people. We were able to visit all the displays of lodge history and never to jockey for position. The overlooks for the lake are plentiful and offer differing views that are all well worth stopping for. Photo opportunities abound, but with changing light conditions, it can be challenging. The West and East rim drives are good roads, especially considering the 44 feet of annual snowfall that cover the area. Both visitors centers are small for a national parks facility. But the views of the lake itself are what visitors come for. It is....breathtaking at first glimpse. Even after viewing the lake through photos, websites and TV, the size of it overwhelms. Expect high prices at the food facilities because everything has to be brought in and the selling season is so short.. Small portions, high prices. Two ice cream bars and a soft drink ran $9.50. We especially enjoyed Vidae Falls, Phantom Ship Overlook and Watchman Overlook. Entry into the park was only $10, a bargain by national park prices. Allow a minimum of 4 hours to see the lodge, visitors center and drive the lake.","August 13, 2011",Nature at its incomparable best!,215,"Scottsdale, Arizona",4

At the waters edge you can take a boat tour (reserve in advance) around the lake or to Wizard Island to be dropped off. If you don't want to take a boat then you can swim in the amazing water of this natural wonder! There is a 12' rock to jump from or you can ease down into the lake, either way, DO IT!

Crater Lake National Park,"We visited Crater Lake in mid July ~ because the park doesn't open until late spring/early summer, some of the roads were still closed to automobile traffic so we were not able to drive the road around the lake. What were able to see however was beautiful. Crater Lake is the deepest and cleanest river in the US - born from a volcano. The boat tour of the lake wasn't open at this time either.I have been to many of the national parks and would only say that this isn't a park for very young children. The main attraction is the boat ride around the lake and hiking (which it seems to be a very short period of time of late July to late September.

Crater Lake National Park,"We hurried to make it to the ticket office to buy boat tour tickets. We changed our minds when we arrived. It is about a mile and a half hike down which is easy. However, coming up it is like climbing a 75 story building straight up. We arrived at 10:00 and the next boat tour we could buy was for 3:00. No one in my family wanted to do the crazy hike so we just drove around the lake. You can also play in the snow. Where else can you were shorts and have a snowball fight.

Crater Lake National Park,"Heading North on Hwy 97 between Klamath Falls and Bend, detouring to Crater Lake (via Hwy 62) adds about 40 minutes of travel time. The drive was easy, even while hauling our travel trailer. There are several viewpoints to stop and overlook impressive deep canyons. We stopped at the Visitor Centre after paying the $10 park entrance fee, but didn’t find it was really necessary. Continuing to drive up to Rim Village was where everything convenes. (Café, gift shop, information, tours, etc.) What an incredible sight – a massive crater bowl with this body of water so picturesque blue, it doesn’t appear real. The colours of blue were amazing to see in nature. The walls of the crater are so tall and steep providing a fantastic framing of the crater. If you've ever been to Banff, Alberta and noted how the mountains look (hard to explain), you see a similar impressive site at Crater Lake. If you have polarized sunglasses or lense for your camera, make sure to bring them; the real diversity of the lake shows itself.We did not have the time to take the Rim Drive, nor any tours. However, there are several options: trolley tour around the rim, boat tours to Wizard Island (a small volcano within the crater bowl) and Phantom Ship (volcano rock standing out of the lake water). The only place you can swim is Cleetwood Cove with requires a hike down to the water’s edge. The water is very cold, so the parks staff told us people don’t last too long in the water. Despite being about 28 C, there were still areas of snow on the side of the road – very odd to see in the first week of August. If you are interested in hiking, there are plenty of trails and peaks to traverse. Crater Lake is a definite must see if only once on your travels. The mere opportunity to take in the spectacle is worth the drive.","August 6, 2011",An amazing spectacle of nature,42,"Delta, Canada",4

The drive itself is beautiful but to get up to the Rim and take this enormous scenery is BREATHTAKING! The lake is pure snow melt and rain runoff and is the most fantastic shade of blue I've ever seen. If you are planning to visit, check the park's website or call for info. Crater Lake can get up to 40 feet of snow a year and it's no shock to still see rifts of snow in July.

Crater Lake National Park,"So you're thinking, or may even have read (probably by some misguided soul with no children) that Crater Lake has little to offer for young children, especially considering the drive. Well, I say bunk to that! I took girls 15, 7, 4 and 2 and let me say that they were thoroughly impressed and entertained! Anyone that can color can recognize a fantastic blue when they see it. The idea of walking on a volcano was only lost on the two year old. Snow on the ground (and lots of it!) in July was very fun as were the waterfalls, the squirells/chipmunks and forests. The old lodge village and all of the people moving about lead to their excitement and with the continuing questions about Wizards Island by the two older ones makes me sure they would have welcomed a chance to set foot on it if time and their hiking abilities had allowed. They never tired of looking out across the lake or down from the steep overlooks as not everything has to be a history or geological lesson.

Crater Lake National Park,"My husband spent 3 nights in Crater Lake last week. The weather was perfect, in the low 70s and the 50s at night. The bad part was that there was still snow on the ground. A LOT of snow. The park had only opened the Rim Highway the day before we arrived, and 90% of the hiking trails were not open because they were covered by snow. My husband had hiked Mt. Scott 2 years ago, but when we drove out there you couldn't even see the parking lot. There must have been 10-12 ft of snow covering it. The park newspaper said the park had 673 inches of snow this winter! We did manage to find a few trails to hike but the mosquitoes were brutal. They are hatching in the snowmelt, and they are ravenous! We used nearly a whole bottle of Deep Woods OFF in 3 days. We had to keep applying it, because as soon as it wore off just a little, we would get swarmed again. Not much fun.

Stayed at Best Western Olympic Inn ( One of the bests in Klamath Falls) and loved the hospitality of this small city. Crater lake is just 51 miles from there and had a great time appreciating might of the nature and beauty around. Deep Blue Color water ( literally) took my couple of heart-bit for sure when I first encountered the Crater Lake and then it never leaves your mind. We were lucky as the boat rides in the lake started lake the same day for this year.

We came down from Matras where we stayed the night before & to start the ride from there to Crater Lake is not all that exciting, but once arrving at Crater Lake the picture opportunities are non-stop. One item of note that surprised us was only the year round road was open by July 8th and about 5/8th's of the rim road was still closed. However, with that said what was open on the rim road on a clear day was fantastic viewing wise. I took too many pictures to count. By lunch time or shortly there after the parking area where to tourist center was getting pretty crowded & difficult to find a parking spot. As a spot I almost mised as a hint to future visitors - make sure you go to the observation point down the steps facing the lake across from the tourist / food center.

The north rim was closed. So we took route 138 - 230 - 62. The entire drive was very scenic. When we reach the lake, the view was spectacular. I never saw water such blue before. While driving back, we decided to take 97 south which was also shown as scenic byway in our map. We drove by the upper klamath lake, national grassland and mount Shasta. I just loved the drive.

Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is a trip worth taking--whether you spend a few days or only a few hours there is up to you.The rim of the lake is a long scenic drive, with many stops for both photo opportunities of the lake and other natural wonders in the area that include streams and lava formations. Crater Lake's water is an exceptionally deep blue due tot he lake's depth. There's a fairly easy hike down to the lake's edge from the rim; a trail of repeating switchbacks with areas to rest along the way. The lake is incredible in scope and there are many interesting things to see. However most would say there are few ""things to do"" here (I put it in quotations because photography and hiking are what I like to are what I ""do""): a boat ride on the lake, a single lodge with a gift shop and a restaurant.The restaurant serves good food and has a fantastic view of the lake.The lake is a beautiful, awe-inspiring place to visit; go see it if you have the chance!","June 29, 2011",Immense Reminder of Nature's Power.,28,"Spangdahlem, Germany",4

The fact that it is a volcano lake and the deepest and one of the clearest lakes in the US is amazing in itself ... then you add the picturesque surroundings ... it is a great day trip. There were a few things I wasn’t expecting ... LOTS and LOTS of mosquitos ... because of all the stagnant water (the mountain gets an average of 45 feet of snow/year) the mosquitos thrive. There was also a good 10-12 feet of snow still on the ground in late April, we even got caught in a pretty significant snow storm, we had to turn our 4WD vehicle around and head for lower elevation. I went back this week, June 25, 2011 and the Rim road was still closed due to snow. We did see a lot of wildlife, Elk, Fawns with their Mamas, porcupines.

In early June, everything except the main road up to the lake's lodge was buried under 9 ft. of snow! We had no idea, since we didn't bother to check their website. We had to climb up steep banks of snow to see the lake, and it was very slippery and dangerous if we weren't very careful. We weren't alone, tho, as there were some others there, also.

There is a short hike (1/2 mile round trip) right near the first visitor's center. It leads to a beautiful meadow full of wildflowers. I could have spent half the day just taking pictures of the flowers. We also saw more flowers on the Annie's Creek hike. This one is a bit harder to find. You need to drive into the camping area at Annie's Creek. There is an amphitheater between sections D and E. The trailhead is behind the amphitheater. Be warned, you will need bug spray, and hike out is a bit strenuous, about 250 feet rather quickly. The payoff is superb. We walked along a gorgeous creek with wildflowers everywhere. It was wonderful! We even saw deer on our way out of the trail.Also, there is a short hike near the Pinnacles. This is a spur road off of the main rim drive. It is well worth the detour.

The cruise was delightful though, with wonderful views. The park ranger, who was our guide, provided a very imformative presentation, which included the history of the park and various landmarks that he pointed out to us as we ventured out to Wizard Island. We also hiked up to the summit of Wizard Island. Again, this was very steep and included lots of switchbacks, but beautiful views of the lake.

The rim roads were not yet open so we could really only get the one view from the visitor center (yes, there was a side entrance to get in). You definitely want to wait until early June to visit. Although if you love snow and want to have a snowball fight we saw a school group having a great time having a snowball fight with the park rangers. I would love to have been able to drive around the rim and spend more time in the park but it was 27 degrees out and snowing lightly. It is an amazing and beautiful spot.

Crater Lake National Park,"We visited all of the national parks in the western USA this summer. Crater Lake was my favorite. The water is the blue of Hawaiian water and the winds ripple it in a beautiful calming pattern. However, be sure to take warm clothes with us for it is chilly even in the summer. We were there in mid July and it was 39 degrees at night. In addition, the drive in was lovely.","December 8, 2009",Crater Lake is Gorgeous,34,"Summersville, West Virginia",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake is a sublime experience. If you have the time, allow around two days there, because the weather may surprise you! We arrived in brilliant sunshine with a mountain-top gale one day and then snow for two days. The experience of staying at Crater Lake Lodge is not to be missed: the Grand Hall with its huge fireplace is a wonderful living space for moments indoors. Breakfasts in the great dining room were huge! If you like pancakes, don't miss them.We were unimpressed with the quality of dinner in the restaurant but suspect it was due to the fact that the head chef was away that particular day.Otherwise you can eat an evening meal in the Great Hall and that is what we did for the rest of the stay.Overall, an unforgettable experience and our thanks to all the wonderful staff there who were friendly and informative.","November 26, 2009","Crater Lake National Park, Oregon",2,Oregon,4

The view of the lake is especially gorgeous during sunny day with just the right amount of clouds.Don't miss the trail that leads down to the lake - the water is icy-cold down there!

Crater Lake National Park,"Place will take your breath away. We were short on time, went in the North Entrance and turned left and went to the first stop. Took a ton of pix. Locals told us that spot is one of three of the best on the lake. Told us to go back past north entrance and the other direction to see Wizard Island. Again, AMAZING view. Then we left. Some people thought the opposite side of the crater was prettier though. No matter, we had a cloudless sky and thought our two viewpoints were just breathtaking. When the wind began kicking up it made whitecaps on the water and kinda messed up the amazing view of it. Luckily we were there Early and saw the lake at it's most pristine calm and colorful.

Crater Lake National Park,"There are many good reviews posted here. Instead of going over the same points in detail, I will sum up.1. Crater Lake is beautiful and you cannot believe how the blue water is. It's worth the trip.2. Check the National Park site for road closures before coming. Snow remains around the lake a good portion of the year. We saw some still lingering in September.3. The Crater Lake Dining Room is pricey. Lunch is cheaper than dinner. The pre-wrapped sandwiches at the gift shop cafe cost about the same as a fresh sandwich or burger at the dining room during lunch. The restaurant at Annie's Creek has an all you can eat buffet for about $15. If you come to Crater Lake, you must take the boat tour. But please take into consideration the 700+ ft vertical gain hike back up to the rim. At $27, I first thought it was pricey, but now believe that the two hour trip around the parameter of Crater Lake is worth the money. Depending on the ranger, you will hear about the history, the geology and the mythology behind Crater Lake. You see a different view of Steel Bay, Llao Point, Wizard Island, and Phantom Ship than from the rim. And if you're lucky, you get to see The Old Man of the Lake, which is a tree that has been floating vertically in Crater Lake since the late 1800's. If you want to go to Wizard Island, it's $37 and you are there for three hours without facilities.","September 19, 2009",Take the Boat Tour,222,Ohio,5
Crater Lake National Park,"Oh my goodness! This place just took my breath away. The water doesn't look real at all. It looks like the lake was painted on. It is so blue and just so beautiful.

Crater Lake National Park,"After a long drive from the Oregon coast(Yachats), about four hours later I arrived at the park around noon. I spent five hours to complete my trip to the park, before driving the four hours back to my hotel. By the time I was leaving the park, my feet were hurting a bit from all the hiking I logged in such a short time. I started by going in the north entrance, and going counter clockwise around Rim Dr. I would suggest starting in that direction, unless you want to go on a boat tour, which going around clockwise will get you there quicker. The Watchman's Overlook trail was challenging, but well worth the hike up the trail. For the most part, the trail is wide, but gets more challenging with multiple cutbacks nearer to the top. The view from the top is amazing. It was most crowded at the lodge and gift shop/restaurant area. I was there on a perfectly beautiful day. I feel for the people who complained that they had bad weather while they were there. That definitely affected their rating of the lake/park. Wear some good boots with strong ankle support. If you go anywhere off the road, you'll need them. Watch the dropoffs also. I was able to walk out on a trail that led right to the edge of a cliff, that dropped straight to the bottom, hundreds of feet down. I couldn't believe I was walking on a trail about 1.5 ft wide, with two sharp dropoffs to either side(see photos)","August 25, 2009",Every photo is beautiful!,7,"Marietta, Georgia",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Wow.. I've wanted to see this since I was a kid but never had the chance. The weather was VERY HOT - for this area - but we knew that in advance and prepared ahead (a good tip for anyone driving and visiting here).We drove from Sacramento to here via Redding (picked up our son) and made it to the top of the rim road for a FABULOUS sunset (see photos). The we drove to the Union Creek Resort (see my review) and spent the night.We returned the next morning, stopped at the visitor center, ASKED QUESTIONS (duh..), picked up the free maps and info, and set off to drive the rim road and hike to the boat dock (from the North side). VERY tough climb (going up from the water) but worth it - we enjoyed the clear, cold water at the bottom for 45 minutes.Showing my photos to my work colleagues helped make the trip worthwhile - everyone wanted to know if the photos were postcards :-)","August 7, 2009",Guess we picked the right days....and checked the internet before driving here,35,Norfolk,5

The perfect blue waters were still the day we arrived so nearby mountains, the snowy rim of the volcano, and other scenes reflected in the lake waters. Crater Lake is out of the way but the drive from Roseburg, OR and the highway to Eugene were so scenic, the time passed quickly. We highly recommend a visit if you have the time as Crater Lake was so pretty we thought it was a glimpse of heaven.","July 19, 2009",This Must Be Heaven,165,Florida,5
Crater Lake National Park,"I had seen pics of Crater Lake before I visited, but nothing could have prepared me for the absolute beauty that I saw . My husband and son biked the road around the rim (about 33 miles), while I drove the car. Just when I thought the view couldn't get any better, I turned a corner and came to an overlook that was even more amazing. To just sit an gaze at the natural wonder is something I could have done for hours. It's truly a place that I'll never forget.....a MUST SEE when in the area. We were there in August and the weather was perfect. Very important to know that summer there doesn't start when the date on the calendar says it does. Check the forecast, pick a day, and enjoy!

Crater Lake National Park,"I almost didn't go to Crater Lake because it was so far out of the way from my intended route. However, at the last minute, we decided to check it out despite the distance. It was well worth it! Even though I was exhausted from driving, my jaw dropped when I drove up Rim Drive and caught my first view of the lake. Words cannot describe how spectacular the view is. Unfortunately, half of the drive around the rim was closed due to snow (end of June), but I still managed to get some amazing views of the lake. The drive can be a little frightening for a Floridian who is not used to mountain roads and snow, but it's amazing.If parts of the Rim Drive are closed, exit the park at the lodge and take the Rogue-Umpqua Scenic Byway (toward Roseburg) instead. It's a a great drive through ancient trees, paralleling rushing rivers through steep canyons.","July 4, 2009",Great Last-Minute Decision,20,"Daytona Beach, Florida",5
Crater Lake National Park,"We were at the lake from June 9, 3 PM to June 12, 10AM 2009 and stayed at Mazama Motor Inn. When we arrived the lake was in full dark blue color and nice, patchy clouds. Two hours later it was socked in with grey clouds. The next three mornings there was no sun rise and the second and third day the lake was fully overcast most of the days. It is beautiful, but at this time of year the weather is iffy. Compared to many other National Parks I would rate this one as average.The big disappointment was that the Easth Rim road is not open. So there was not much to do since the road is closed and the trails were all closed. We were told much of the time the East Rim does not open until some time in July.The motor inn was an OK place to stay. It is a 7 mile trip to the lake and takes about 15 minutes. We ate at the Crater Lake Lodge and found the food good, a little on the pricey side for some people. The restaurant near the motor lodge was excellent, the price is about the same as CL lodge, however it is a buffet. They will cook your eggs, omelette any way you want. All of the expected breakfast goodies are available. Make sure you try their homemade scones. My recommendation would be to only spend one night at the park unless the trails are open. It takes about one hour the circle the lake but to take photos then expect about 2 to 3 hours. So, if you only want to see the lake and the weather is OK then one day is sufficient and then head off to your next destination.","June 15, 2009",Good Place to visit...if weather is good,8,San Francisco Bsy Area,3

Some days it can be very cold and foggy and you can hardly see the lake. Other days you hit it right and the area is truly a sight to behold! Either way, make sure you take a jacket...it can be cold there even in summer! The lake is as blue as blue can get! Simply beautiful. There is a lodge there and a gift shop, but it's a bit overpriced in my opinion.","October 7, 2008",Your mileage may vary....,95,"Phoenix, Arizona",4
Crater Lake National Park,"Unfortunately, fires had been burning in the area for weeks - information not on the website. Even googling it now I'm not finding much current info, though info available at the visitor center indicated it was up to 18,000 acres and not very much contained! At least we were lucky and the roads were still open, though the ""bowl"" of the crater was mostly filled with smoke. No photo opss of spectacular deep blue lake for us! Other than drive around the lake, we stopped at the visitor center and watched the interesting video about the history of the lake and its formation. Not much else to do or see at the visitor's center. Fortunately I had done some research before hand, so we stopped at the Phantom Ship viewpoint and did a short hike up to the viewpoint. It was very cool (though poorly marked; go to the left at the ""V"" and the rim); we timed it right, late in the day, so an awesome reflection in the water - very phantom like. Otherwise, after several stops to go ""ooh"" and ""ahhh"", that started to get old - and we are a group that really likes to ""ooh"" and ""ahhh"". A few hours was enough for us.

Crater Lake National Park,"On my way South out of Portland, I veered way east to get to Crater Lake. I came in from the North (August means the roads are open), and went out the south. I gave myself a couple of hours to do the siteseeing thing before driving on. Turns out, I needed more time.I ended up taking the road around the west side of the crater. It was much shorter to the village, but I really should have driven east on the inside of the road. The pavement is crumbling off in places and since I was both the driver and the tourist, the only time I could take my eyes off the road was in the pullouts. (which blessedly were many). They really need to fix that road for flatlanders like me who don't like getting anywhere near the edge of nowhere. (no rails either). yikes!Having said that, I wouldn't have missed it for the world. I arrived early morning when the fog was still low and I got to see the fog lift off the lake and leave it spectacularly blue as soon as the sun came out. It was wonderfully cold (50degrees) compared to the 105 that Portland was the day before. There is lots of wildlife around and the rangers said it was rare to see them. Not so. A deer walked right in front of me, stopped and stared at me like I was a new model of car he hadn't seen before. There is still snow (yes, in late August) along the side of the road. I had to take pictures of course, because no one in the south would believe that. The village is a little A-frame with a gift shop and a beautiful patio and 7-11style food for $10 a sandwich. The cashier rang up a sandwich, drink and chips for me and when he said it was $18, I thought he was kidding. The patio was gorgeous, sunny and cool with folks from far and near (as evidenced by the variety of license plates I saw, from California to New Jersey). Definitely worth going out of your way to see it. I wish I had several more hours to spend. I really wanted to go to the Pinnacles but just could not squeeze the time in.","September 8, 2008","Defies description, but I'll try",239,"Arlington, Texas",5
Crater Lake National Park,"Crater Lake in Southern Oregon is one of the natural wonders of the Northwest, and if you are visiting this region, you MUST put it on your list! The water is incomparably indigo, the story of how it was created is amazing and every view point is breathtaking. I am originally from Oregon as is my family, and my husband is from Connecticut. We live outside of Philly and go home a couple times a year for vacation and to visit the family. My parents, brother and the two of us took a two-night trip down to Southern Oregon to check out Crater Lake and a few other spots, and learned some lessons along the way about the best way to visit.1. Our timing was perfect. July and August is the best time to go for great weather and clear passes around the rim of the lake. You'll be surprised to find some small patches of snow, even so!2. Plan on staying at least two nights, and stay at Crater Lake Lodge! The lodge is ground zero for lake visitors and everything you do will be made that much easier if you stay here. Plus it is gorgeous and has a lovely restaurant as well. 3. As soon as you arrive at the Lodge, start working on getting Wizard Island tickets for the next day, or day after if they are sold out. Tickets go FAST (we missed out because we didn't know this). The only reasonable way to get tickets for both Wizard Island and the Lake boat tour is at the Lodge the day before (at desk across from check-in area). You will have to stand in line and be flexible about timing. 4. I would be wary of the 3 hour boat tour. The boat has no cover and if it's a hot day, hours 2 and 3 on the lake may be pretty miserable! We signed up for this, and then thought about it and returned the tickets (not an easy thing to do so think about it ahead of time!).5. Be aware of the hike down to the boat. I read that the 700 ft drop in elevation means it's like 65 flights of stairs on the way back up! You must be in shape and have good walking shoes on to do this!6. If you are planning on going in and out of the National Park area, hold on to your receipt from when you first enter- it's good for 7 days!7. If you want to make a longer trip of it and you like the outdoors, here's a couple other suggestions for places that are nearby. Odell lake is a lovely spot about an hour north of Crater Lake, they have a great lodge and restaurant (check out my Odell Lake Lodge review here on Tripadvisor) and boat rentals. Also they have some nice lake front camping sites if you reserve far enough in advance. Diamond lake is a personal favorite of mine and I spent lots of long weekends growing up camping there. They have a great bike/walking trail that encircles the lake and a lodge with rentals and restaurant. They also have cabin rentals, but I have never tried them (but plan to on a future trip!).Enjoy your trip to Crater Lake and remember, a photo will never do it justice- so soak it all in!!!","August 11, 2008",Crater Lake: Do it right!,34,"Seattle, Washington",4
Crater Lake National Park,"If you visit Crater Lake and have the time I recommend taking the boat tour. the only problem is the hike to the landing. It is about 1.1 miles one-way and descends anywhere from 700 to 900 feet depending on which guide you read. It took my wife and I 15 minutes to descend and 35 minutes to get back up. the ranger guided tour was informative and entertaining if you can tolerate Ranger Dave's jokes. The view of the lake from ground level is spectacular.

The mosquitos were so thick we decided not to make the trek which is pretty steep, from what we heard. Also, make sure you make your reservations for the lodge at least a year in advance, they very rarely have cancellations, although you can ask after 6pm if there are cancellations. You can hang out at the lodge in the rocking chairs if you want to rest.Remember your hand sanitizer too - the bathrooms are rustic around the lake!","July 25, 2008",Take Bug Spray!!,25,Utah,4
Crater Lake National Park,"First of all, check if the north entrance is open. It was blocked when I went, which forced me to have to drive a long ways out of the way. It is open from late June to early September, depending on snow. Speaking of snow, there is a LOT of snow. On average, Crater Lake National Park gets about 40 feet of snow a year. I went in the middle of June and there were still piles of snow that were higher than my dad's head (he's 5'10"")! It is really fun to slide down the snow, but it blocked all of the hiking paths, so everyone was confined to the same place. All you could do was look at the lake and try to walk around the lake to get away from people (I had to walk over the snow). It is still worth it to go, even if you can only go when the snow is there, but it would be better to go in July or August. There is no ferry until July. The cafe sucks, except for the soup. It is over priced as well. Do not go there! Enjoy the views of the lake. It is amazing! The water is extremely blue, one of the bluest lakes I have seen in the entire world.

Crater Lake National Park,"This is a beautiful place. That goes without saying. It is a natural wonder and it has been protected from commercialism, development or general spoilage by careful management. I can only tell you that you should see this amazing place. Here's how.If you want to do it leisurely, plan well in advance and get a reservation at the Lodge at the lake and spend a couple of days. ORDrive in from the north as we did from Bend on OR-138 (one of the most interesting, scenic road I've ever been on that goes up and down in an absolutely straight line for miles from OR-97 to OR-232. See photo.) As you come to Crater Lake (after the Pumice desert - a treasure for geology lovers) the Crater Rim road will head both to the right and the left (same road goes all the way around the Lake.) If you take the left turn and head to the east, all your turnouts will be on your right, making it much easier to go on and off the road. It's a little thing, but nice to know. The whole Lake area is breathtaking, and if you know anything at all about geology you will appreciate both its beauty and its history as reflected in the formations, slides and other wonders.As you work your way around the Lake - about 1/3 of the way on the Eastbound road, 2/3's from the Westbound, you will come to the turnoff for the Pinnacles. Do NOT drive past this. You have to figure if they've built a road just to get to a place, see it, and then come back, you really ought to go. These fumaroles are amazing and spectacular. Drive the extra 14 miles round trip to go and see. About 1/2 way around the Lake you'll come to the ""Village"" and there is a gift shop, restrooms and a decent little deli there. Grab lunch and, if the weather is nice, eat on the patio. (We were there on a stunning day in September.) We left Crater Lake and drove to Roseburg for the night. We agreed that it is possible to become exhausted from the ""Wow"" factor, and we were wonderfully worn out.","September 25, 2007",A Beautiful Sight - some suggestions.

Crater Lake National Park,"The Crater Lake Rim Drive is a 33 mile road around the perimeter of the lake. We spent most of the afternoon doing the drive stopping at the various lookouts along the way. The rim of the lake is steep so don't expect to sit on the beach at the edge of the lake. However this does mean that there are several good vantage points to get great views. Along the way we saw small wildlife including chipmunks & blue jays. The lake is a deep blue color with a couple notable features: Wizard Island, so named because it is shaped like a large wizard hat, and the Phantom Ship which is a rock formation that looks like a large sailing ship from the distance. We stopped at the main visitors center to look around. There are a few small displays and a video presentation about the lake's creation.The park is a fair ways off the main routes so plan ahead. Roads are good, although we ran into some construction delays.
