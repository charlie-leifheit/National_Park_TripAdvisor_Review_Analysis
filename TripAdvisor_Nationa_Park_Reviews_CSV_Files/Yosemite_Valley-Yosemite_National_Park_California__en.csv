Yosemite Valley,"Take the drive, stop often. You will have unique views of spectacular sights all over this area. It will be busy, but worth it.","October 18, 2019",Busy place for awesome scenery.,4,"Charleston, West Virginia",5
Yosemite Valley,"So many beautiful places all through the valley! Majestic views, gorgeous meadows, the Merced River, Even in October it was rather crowded, but we usually found a place to park to get out and enjoy the scenery and short hikes.","October 16, 2019",So much to see!,6,"St. Charles, IL",5
Yosemite Valley,We had one day walking around. Not a lot of water in the streams but the waterfall into Lower Falls was flowing. Took a walk up to the pool at the bottom of the waterfall. It’s a tough walk over the rocks but well worth it. ,"October 13, 2019",Fabulous views. ,153,"Wroughton, United Kingdom",5
Yosemite Valley,If you are going to Yosemite the Valley is awfully crowded and the scenery is good but not spectacular. To really enjoy Yosemite go to the eastern part of the park where there is less traffic and people and the scenery is Spectacular. The best part start about 10 miles west of Tolumne Meadows and is great all the way all Tioga Pass Road to the Park exit.,"October 11, 2019",The Eastern Part of the Park is by Far the Best Part,106,"henderson, Nv",4
Yosemite Valley,"And still not see everything that there is to do. Short and long hikes, checkout the app all-trails app for details on maps/times/difficulty. We stayed on housekeeping camp which was perfect EXCEPT I wish they had a give/take table. There were a few things we could have used and a few things we would have liked to have passed along ","October 11, 2019",You could spend a month in the valley ,66,,5
Yosemite Valley,"Can anyone give this less than a 5? I guess if they're reviewing service, or the traffic signs (which I admit are bad), or people in general, they may give less than a 5. Regardless, for nature-lovers and others, this is a MUST SEE at least once in your lifetime. Really. It's that spectacular! There are trails for every fitness level, and eye candy everywhere you look. Don't miss the Ranger talks. Also, the Theater has wonderful programs. So much to do! Plan ahead, bicycle, hike, float down a river, tour (or stay! $$$$$) at the Majestic Yosemite...always to be known as the Ahwahnee Hotel. If you're driving in for the day, get there before 9 or risk not getting a parking space. Enjoy this beautiful, magnificent display of nature. This place is magical. And remember: SPEEDING KILLS BEARS!","October 10, 2019",Marvel at God's handiwork,16,,5
Yosemite Valley,"You can see everything (almost) from the valley - looking up of course. Cafe opens at 11am, but large gift shop/snack shop open earlier. Lots of parking at visitors centers. Phone signals go out for most of the drive in Yosemite. We printed out our directions from sight to sight, and boy are we glad we did. Lots of restrooms, but several are closed! Beware!","October 10, 2019",Love the valley drive,66,"Naples, Florida",5

Yosemite Valley,"If you must drive through the Valley on the Weekend expect it to take 2 hours. If you take the bus system bring some anti-bacteria gel, becuase you are packed in like a Train from India.","October 7, 2019",Do not Brave the Valley on the weekend.,0,"Westminster, California",5
Yosemite Valley,"We visited Yosemite in early September.It was quite a busy park, some nice walks but it was very busy and unfortunately there weren't any waterfalls.It's a nice park but definitely not our favourite national park in America.","October 7, 2019",Nice park but not our favourite,29,,3
Yosemite Valley,"From there you have views of ALL the beauty of Yosemite. Of all the spots in the Valley, the cemetery was my favorite. So peaceful, full of birds and critters. Sit quietly and listen to the wind blow through the black oaks. A special place.","October 6, 2019",A delightful place to visit,95,"Las Cruces, New Mexico, United States",5
Yosemite Valley,There are some stunning views here but all the people and cars spoil it. The trails are quite rightly accessible to all people but if you stay low then all the trails are busy and the car parks full unless you get there early. Much better to get up high. Views are stunning and the walk up to Mirror Lake is nice but as expected the lake is very dry around September. Food and drink expensive.,"October 6, 2019",Lovely but busy,1,,3
Yosemite Valley,"It’s easy to be craning your neck at all of Yosemite’s dramatic vistas, and hiking along the valley gives you a perspective that’s quiet and more normal feeling, yet with surrounding dramatic vistas. You can amble along an easy pathway reading about milkweed and butterflies... or sign up for a tram tour that takes you to various spots. I’d opt for both. ","October 6, 2019", Lovely spot that gives you a perspective on the surrounding majesty of Yosemite ,76,"Encinitas, California",5
Yosemite Valley,We drove from an overnight stop in Buck Meadows to our next overnight stop in Bishop. This took in Yosemite Valley and the Tioga Pass. What can I say? No wonder this is a national park! The scenery is spectacular! Enjoy. Soak it up!,"October 5, 2019",Enjoy And Soak It Up,21,"Melbourne, Australia",5
Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is basically the epicentre and beating heart of the park. You can get to all of the popular sites from here. The scenery is truelly breathtaking. Make sure you take a camera! Unfortunately we didnt see any bears or big horn sheep. But we did see plenty of chipmunks!One tip - DO NOT go at the weekend, if you must, then go extremely early otherwise you will spend literally hours looking for a place to park.Yosemite is one of the finest National Parks in the world but suffers badly from poor management. If the people running the place would limit the numbers of people entering, or better still only allow pre-booked tickets up to a certain number then make that date unavailable online, it would make for a much more enjoyable visit. They know you're going to spend half of your day looking for a space to park but are more than happy to take your money.It still gets 5 stars because of the sheer beauty of the place.","October 5, 2019",Must see,35,"Manchester, United Kingdom",5
Yosemite Valley,Fantastic view of the valley and mountains all at once. Most popular stopping area for pics. Parking gets more limited as the day goes on.,"October 3, 2019",Breathtaking,2,,5
Yosemite Valley,"The road in Yosemite National Park makes a big circle around Yosemite Valley. So it literally is in the center of your trip around and around the park. Pull off anywhere and get a view of El Capitan, Half Dome, Bridalveil Falls or whatever and beautiful Yosemite Valley will be in the foreground of your pictures. Make sure to try to get out early morning or late evening when the sun lights up the meadows. ","September 30, 2019",Center of it all,393,"North Canton, Ohio",5
Yosemite Valley,"We were visiting Yosemite to celebrate my 70th birthday. My birthday fell on a Saturday so I booked three rooms at the Ahwahnee Hotel and dinner for eight in the dining room. The hotel and dining experience was excellent.We were sightseeing near Bridal Veil Falls and started heading to the hotel which was about five miles away. Because of traffic it took us nearly three hours to travel the five miles. We were late for our dinner reservation, fortunately the dining room held our table for us.Lesson learned, don’t go to Yosemite on a weekend.","September 30, 2019",Don’t go on a weekend,41,"San Francisco, California",4
Yosemite Valley,Yosemite is a must see from sweet meadows to amazing granite cliffs to fabulous water falls to green lush Forrest to picturesque lakes. Would definitely need at least a couple of days to see the most well known attractions. The village has lots to see and a museum and Indian village a brilliant visitor centre and the guides and rangers are extremely friendly and knowledgable.,"September 29, 2019",Fantastic visit,20,"Holywell, United Kingdom",5
Yosemite Valley,"My wife and I stayed at Yosemite Valley Lodge, drove to see a lot of the vistas, saw an Elk, numerous raccoons and small animals. No bears .We had a blast. Some of the driving was challenging due to the hairpin turns. Be prepared! ","September 29, 2019","Wonderful - views, wildlife and lodging ",27,"Hendersonville, Tennessee",5
Yosemite Valley,"We had been counting down to the day we visited Yosemite and it lived up to every expectation. We got there quite early, around 8:30am and there was no queue to get in and the roads weren’t busy. We stopped off to take in El Capitan, before parking close to the village center to walk the Yosemite Falls trail. After this we drove to Glacier Point, via Tunnel View and Sentinel Dome - we only had a day here so we didn’t walk up, but the drive was bendy and steep and hard work on its own.The views are, as you’d expect, incredible. Everywhere you look, whether at a view point or walking around, everything looks like a picture.We finished with Mirror Lake, and this is where I would just mention that, as we went late September, there was very little water around the falls and the lakes, so that is something to take into account when planning. Of course the pro side of this is less traffic and footfall.It’s $35 for a pass, which lasts a week, and whilst we did everything we wanted to in a day, I can see why people could spend two or three days here doing different trails.","September 25, 2019",Yosemite in one day ,4,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",5
Yosemite Valley,"One of the most spectacular parks in the US. We really enjoyed it there. Very easy to hike, suitable for all levels and ages. We took the shuttle that passes through all the major points. The shuttle is free! It is advisable to park your car near the Lodge Hotel and move inside the valley with the shuttle or by bike.The routes are very beautiful and some in the summer also include water access, vantage points, picnic areas, mountain climbing, wildlife viewing and more ... Near Hotel Lodg there is Starbucks cafe.Inside the valley there are good restaurants.There are cheap camping sites in the valley. It is advisable to book places in advance.It is recommended to spend two to three days in the valley and other places in the park","September 24, 2019",One of the most beautiful US parks,39,"Tel Aviv, Israel",4
Yosemite Valley,"Well, Yosemite is a REALLY amazing place that is clearly not limited to the valley. The problem is that for most of tourists Yosemite equals Yosemite Valley. Therefore, it's absolutely overcrowded there and a real challenge to park your car (which makes you lose a precious time). A hint : go in the park very early and do not hesitate to leave your car at the entrance of the valley to take the free shuttle.Anyway this mass-tourism-atmosphere and the people strolling everywhere ruin the more than decent views of the valley, the calm of the meadows, and of course drive away the wildlife.So to sum it up, rush Tunnel View (iconic view), Valley view, and flee to the hiking trails, to Glacial Point, to Tuolumne Meadow ...One last thing : if you go at the end of the summer, you might be disappointed as the waterfalls are really thin.","September 23, 2019",Over-crowded,7,"Paris, France",4
Yosemite Valley,"This is our third visit to the park and it still is truely our favourite, but only just in front of Yellowstone, Bryce and Zion. Firstly, yes it is very busy but there is a reason for that - it’s one of the most popular parks in the world and for good reason. I’ll just tell you that we planned (actually my wife did) this well: 1st visit September during the week, stayed at Big trees lodge (now Wawona) and drove into park early: no problem, 2nd visit June during the week (amazing amount of water from melting snow), again no problem with park entry if you leave hotel at a reasonable time). 3rd visit September Friday and Saturday: stayed 1st night in park’s lodge and 2nd night Wawona, again no problem but that’s because we got up and parked at a reasonable time on the Saturday, you can’t arrive at 9:30am and think there will be no traffic. We drove in via Tioga pass from Lee Vining which everyone should experience as it’s almost as beautiful as the area inside the village. The whole park is beautiful at every turn, most parks have sections that are WOW and then sections that are really nice, Yosemite is WOW pretty much everywhere. We stayed at Wawona (3rd visit), seriously, sitting on the veranda drinking a beer, eating nice food staring at a deer walking across the lawn, it doesn’t get much better. It’s basic, but that’s what you expect a hotel built in the 1870s to be like, I think someone complained there wasn’t a lift to the 2nd floor (there’s only 2 floors) - really!  I think if you really want to enjoy this magnificent place; go at a reasonable time of year, bring food (village food area is very very hard to get parking), go early in the morning (not daybreak, just early), try the Tioga Pass drive at some stage as well, it’s beautiful, especially when water is really flowing. Park inside one of the allotted areas and get the free shuttle that runs around the park. ","September 22, 2019",Our favourite park so far. ,0,"Sydney, Australia",5
Yosemite Valley,"The tunnel view when emerging into the Yosemite Valley is truly awe inspiring. No one did it better than Ansel Adams. It is a must see spot. The valley has to be one of the most beautiful places on earth; however, there are some very serious problems on the valley floor. We had waited until after Labor Day to hopefully find it less crowded. If the second week of September has less people than high summer then the valley floor must seem like a DisneyWorld in the Woods experience. One would think that the two line bus system would be efficient, but we found it confusing, especially when the bus driver announces that he is changing his route to not stop at everyplace listed on his line’s schedule. Signage is poor and we found quite a few other tourist constantly scanning their maps and GPS to try and figure out how the heck they could get from point A to point B. Add the multiple ares under construction and you have quite a mess. There must now be so many visitors that the normal sanitation facilities are strained to the point that several “porta potties” are needed. I do not mind using one, but when the human waste has practically reached the rim of the toilet seat, then there is a serious problem that someone is ignoring.","September 22, 2019","Spectacular; however, some real downsides...",7,,4
Yosemite Valley,We were overwhelmed with the beauty of the valley from the moment we caught our first glimpse from the tunnel view on our arrival. The grandeur of the granite rock faces towering over our heads was beyond my expectation. The variety of hiking trails for different skill levels was great! ,"September 22, 2019",Breathtaking,3,,5
Yosemite Valley,"The Valley was easy to see by eco bus, but I also took the tour, which was well worth it. I learned more that way and was glad to let someone else drive. Take some hikes too! I’ll be back. I loved the beauty here. ","September 22, 2019",Iconic views,12,"Lexington, Kentucky",5

One of the best national parks i have ever visited.You have everything here.. Rainbows, water falls, trails, nature, hikes, mountains, valleys, etc etc.. i love photography, but this trip, I didnt carry my heavy lenses, and wanted to enjoy nature with my mirrorless and phone cam.. Just loved every second.. We exited the park through stanilas national park.. roads were tough to drive, and there was no gas stations.. make sure you have enough gas, and if u see a gas station pls fill it up 100 %.. Loved it overall. one of our best trips in our life..","September 19, 2019",Fantastic trip,79,"Edison, New Jersey",5
Yosemite Valley,"This is a beautiful national park with excellent accessibility for all. Yes, there are a number of mountain trails that anyone with mobility problems most certainly wouldn't be able to tackle. However, a lot of thought and effort has gone into making the valley as accessible as possible, without destroying large areas of the natural environment. It is an absolute must see. I visited in May during the unexpected snow storm and it was breathtaking. The waterfalls were roaring, and when the sun burned through the cloud it was incredibly picturesque. The campsites were full, but as the park is vast it didn't feel overcrowded. Parking in the valley can be difficult so it's worth arriving early doors if you want to park near the start of a trail. I note that there are frequent shuttle bus services through the park though.","September 19, 2019",A stunning national park with excellent accessibility,21,"Toulouse, France",5
Yosemite Valley,"So you already know that Yosemite is one of the most beautiful places on the planet - that's why it's the Disney of National Parks. For me it lived up the hype. We waited until after labor, went on weekdays all in attempt to avoid the maddening crowds - for the most part we did but it was still a very busy place. 5 stars on the scenery for sure, 2 stars for government mismanagement. Specific gripes: tough parking, driving is a bad idea if you can avoid it (use the free shuttle as much as yo can), speed limits aren't enforced at all, honking car horns, road ragey drivers, long ques for anything. Visitor center opened at 9am, crowd of about 80 people waiting to get in- There were 2 rangers at the help desk, so that will take up several hours of your yosemite time if you want any assistance. Shuttle to Glacier Point - we wanted to take the one way (bargain $26 per person) so we could hike down. It was booked solid and we couldn't. Turns out there are only 2 a day and they book up fast. Perhaps at $26 each way they could add more? I would like to see some crowd control of some kind, some speed enforcement, and since owned by the US Taxpayer, perhaps they could ease up a little on the price gouging. But the bottom line: spectacular, jaw dropping scenery - I'm glad I went.","September 19, 2019",5 Stars but several complaints,2,Harvest,5
Yosemite Valley,"The valley encompasses the magnificent cliffs, waterfalls, meadows and wildlife that spells Yosemite. It is beautiful in all its seasons. It is the national park among national parks. It is one of the oldest and perhaps the most beautiful. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, you decide.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite National Park is simply one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen and probably ever will be. My recommendation would be to do some research before you go, just so when you see in real life it will mean more knowing some of the history. Visit as much as you can of the National Park. Its hard to say much more as words can't describe this wonderful place.","September 15, 2019",A must see for all,20,"Geelong, Australia",5

Yosemite Valley,"There's no sign telling you that the one mountain is El Capitan. There were no climbers on it the day we visited the park. With Skyline Drive, in Virginia, there are mile markers. Signs tell you how many miles to Skyland or Big Meadows. Not here. There's a shuttle bus system, but there's more than one. It was all confusing. Our shuttle bus driver told us which mountain was El Capitan. While most pictures show the meadow at El Capitan, if you're not a fan of heights, thie rest of the park is up really high. Overall, I'm glad we went.","September 15, 2019","Oh, there's El Capitan",54,"Calabash, North Carolina",3

Yosemite Valley,Absolutely amazing views. We’re not hikers so preferred to drive to each point. Because we weren’t hikers it didn’t take us all day though. The views were magnificenty and definitely worth a visit. Take food though as the services inside are abysmal (as are the toilets).

Yosemite Valley,"We spent a day / 1 night in Yosemite from Death valley and you can't, as expected beat the scenery.It is quite simply breaktaking....However, I have some tips, which we didn't do and wish we had......We went via Tioga Pass, which is unbelievable. I mean unbelievable. Such an incredible drive... If the road is open, please go this way, it is worth it...We drive from Death Valley to Yosemite and was looking forward to seeing the main parts, but we didn't appreciate at all just how big Yosemite is... It is vast, when we paid at the entrance gate the fees to enter the park and our lodge was still another 41 miles, we were blown away.... It is enormous and I mean enormous....Endless walks, endless sights to see and endless picnic areas as you would expect... It is a 4 or 5 day break of endless everything in the fresh air, however...I think it is in need of URGENT and desperate rethinking around the Village. It is just too small. It took 2 hours to crawl into the main village, so we missed our tour pre paid for as the traffic crawls along and when you get there, the parking is chaotic. No structure, no planned carparks and no in/out that makes any sense to keep traffic flowing.They need to urgently build an in/out which is separated from each other and also plan visitor access. It made our visit fraught as we spent more time in the car than seeing the wonderful views. Madness... so disappointed, but the main thrust of my review is plan and plan well.It is so big and offers so much, plan... Get there early, be prepared to leave late and plan the trip.","August 28, 2019",Scenery well worth seeing,108,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",4

Yosemite Valley,"Our trip was planned with precision, we only had one day and we had heard how busy this park gets. We had the perfect trip. We chose to stay at a hotel around 30 miles from the park, the Yosemite Westgate Lodge.We set off at around 7.30am. The air temperature was cool which was great, as by midday the temperatures were into the 90's. There was very minimal traffic on the roads and no queue at the entrance gates. We paid 35 dollars for a 7 day pass for our car.We stopped off at a couple of view points on the way in, which were heavenly due to the crowds not having arrived, Bridaldail Falls and Tunnel View. We arrived at the Visitors Center at 9.30am after our couple of stops, there were quite a lot of cars parked already but we had no problems getting a good parking spot. Also in the village, there is a General Store selling souvenirs and food and drinks and a Cafe for coffee and snacks.We took the free park bus, for a loop and got off at a few places for nice walks. By midday the park was getting busy and the buses were standing room only. This was our cue to leave the park.Due to the planning we had done, we had a thoroughly enjoyable, quiet and reletavily peaceful trip to the park.Our biggest tips, get there early and leave early and take in all the stunning scenery and enjoy the coolness of the morning.","August 27, 2019",Stunningly Beautiful - A Perfect Trip,143,"Manchester, United Kingdom",5
Yosemite Valley,"If you are visiting CA, this is must do attraction. We visited Yosemite National Park in May 2019. We truly enjoyed the trip and loved it very much. We stayed at Yosemite Westgate Lodge, which is around 30 mins from Big Oak Flat Entrance. Make sure you enter the park early in the morning to cover maximum points. I suggest, spend at least 2 days here to enjoy the nature. It took us around 4 hrs (with a break) to reach here fro San Jose. You should go straight to Visitors Center. Peopls over there can guide you to plan your trip. They will suggest which places you can cover. There is a shuttle service also which takes you around the Park. You can stop at view points / waterfalls on the way before you reach Visitors Centre. It is inside the park, took us around 1 hr to reach from Big Oak Flat entrance.Waterfalls were at their peaks. View was amazing. Luckily, on our 2nd day, Glacier Point road opened which was closed due to snow. Roadside was covered with snow, drive was very beautiful.

It was still busy but we focused on the stunning view of the valley. Yosemite's story is that this valley actually flooded a few years back. It is still a few miles to get to the trail head from here.

Please buy your national park pass in advance. Thats the easiest entry into the park you can get in very quickly. You have to arrive in the valley by 8 am. Otherwise parking will be an absolute nightnare. We parked at the lodge because the visitor center was already full. There are shuttle buses available but they have crazy wait times. We rented bikes! That was the best decision we made. There are bike paths all over and you dont have to fight with the cars for space. There are bike rentals at the lodge. It was $34 each to return by 6:45. It was a great deal for the whole day. We started with Yosemite lower falls, biked through the gorgeous meadows and saw some beautiful views of glacier point. We visited the chapel, conservation center and then headed to curry village had some pizza, headed to happy isles, hiked vernal falls, rode to visitor center and headed to lodge.

Good luck finding parking anywhere, families crawling everywhere,people taking selfies in every single direction,$35 entrance fee. Honestly it reminds me of an amusement park.it should be noted the $35 fee does cover re-entry for a few days and also entrance to sierra/kings canyon national forests.Also if you're going the airbnb route it's pretty tough to find anything w/in an hour of the park.

We found weather in mid-May incredibly changeable and benefited from bringing plenty of layers, gloves, sunglasses and sun cream! During one hike, we started off in beautiful sunshine wearing just T-shirts and light trousers. As we ascended we reached a Narnia like snowy wonderland requiring gloves and waterproof clothing! Living in the UK, I have never seen so much snow! People we met were very friendly and respectful of the nature around them. Most follow the 'leave nothing behind but footprints' addage which is great. There are fewer information boards around relative to Yellowstone (Which is fine), so bring a good guide book so you can find out more about the awesome (in the literal sense) scenery around you.

The free bus shuttle was good but required some planning so we didn't spend a long time sitting in it as it only goes one-way around the valley.

We were so lucky in finding a spot for tunnel view, but it took us twice as long just to maneuver out of the parking lot.We also had to circle around the lot for the gift shop and basically cut people off who tried to steal our spot.

None of the “parking attendants” seemed to be assisting anyone in finding a spot to park and despite some parking lots being completely full, the attendants were still allowing more cars to enter which resulted in many cars simply driving around in circles waiting for someone to leave (which was never going to happen at 8.30am!). This cannot be good for the environment.Every restroom in the Park that we used were DISGUSTING! Either inside a park building, food outlet or further out in the park, there was toilet paper all over the floor, either no toilet paper, no soap to wash your hands or no paper towels to dry your hands. This was a sign of poor maintenance which we found shocking. Signage was terrible - really difficult to easily navigate your way around the village and park on the basis of the maps and signs which exist. Nothing was clear and could have very easily been better sign-posted. After taking a shuttle bus to Stop 17 to do there Mirror Lake trail, which was 5 miles in length, we got to the end to find no signs for the shuttle bus at all and ended up walking another 1.5 miles to find another shuttle stop. The shuttle buses were crammed full of people, one of the female drivers was rude and hostile to passengers and those waiting at bus stops. We ate a meal at one of the Bar & Grill outlets (one was a takeaway and one was a seat-in - we did the seat-in).

On the way once you pass the tunnel, stop to take in the view of half dome, cloud rest, cathedral rocks, bridalveil falls.El Captain Yosamite Village was packed. It was so hard to find a parking space. We also visited the Mariposa Grove to see those majestic sequoias. It was a great hike. There were three loops you can choose from. We did see a man bear and a cub, deer and lots of squirrels on the way to Glaciers point. I think it would take at least a week to do everything I had on my list. Unfortunately I couldn’t do them all. It is a lovely national park. Fresh air and smell pine and cedar in the forest was beautiful.","July 4, 2019",Holiday ,9,,5

Yosemite Valley,"We were very exited and lived up a long time for this visit. It was the worst experience in a NP we ever had. - It already starts at the line to enter the park. There are no different lanes differentiating between pass holders, people that will camp in the park, and day visitors that still need to pay by card/cash. Creating special lanes for each purpose will make entry a lot more efficient. - The park is way too crowded, roads are so full that you're in constant traffic and sometimes even stand still for a while. In the valley itself it was complete mayhem, people started turning in the middle of the road or just double parked because they did not see any other option.- The extreme overcrowding of the park made parking at highlights also a living hell. There are no staff members helping at the parking lots, making it a very unclear situation. Lines are extremely long and people are afraid they cannot find a spot and therefore keep waiting at the beginning of the parking lot, even though there are a lot of free spots if they just keep driving. It was such an awful situation I directed a few waiting cars to a free spot myself. Parking assistance would be highly appreciated and will definitely reduce the waiting time.Then, you finally, after a 3 hour drive and 30 minute wait you found a spot, and the restaurant at Glacier Point serves... well. Just cold sandwiches and some ice cream.- I really don't understand why they don't put a few nice restaurants, or at least a snack bar at the highlights or near the visitor centre, and sell some (of course way overpriced, but that's fine because we're in Yosemite) burgers, salads and other fresh and hot meals. We drove to the valley, but there was traffic also really extreme, and no food to be found.- Personally I believe there are not enough stops aside the road. There are plenty of beautiful areas and if they would just create more stops, people can divide easier over the park. Making lines for toilets (which were disgusting btw) shorter (I counted at Glacier Point; there were 33 people in line, and the other toilet building was ""closed for the season"")I think Yosemite management should really limit the number of vehicles entering the park, maybe with an online service making reservations possible. They should definitely improve services such as food, restrooms and parking. People are very willing to pay for these services if they were provided. This could generate a lot of new jobs and make everyone a lot happier.","July 2, 2019","The nature is great, but that's about it",60,"Schalkhaar, The Netherlands",1

Yosemite Valley,"Just spent a few days exploring the valley and park - it is truly amazing. Climbed up to Yosemite Point on the first day to see upper Yosemite falls. Then explored the valley lowlands, Lower Yosemite Falls and then hiked the Nevada Falls Trail to see Vernal and Nevada falls in subsequent days. Not sure if it was related to the time of year, but there was a lot of water throughout the park and the waterfalls and lakes were flushed. Also wanted to see Hetch Hetchy, Tolumne Meadows and others but was unable due to time restrictions. As a recommendation, it takes about a whole day to do one big thing - so plan accordingly. Traffic was not that bad, but per my research, we avoided peak season by going before July 4th week. That said, parking - especially in the main areas, was not very good - but we were able to beat this somewhat by getting into the park ASAP (~7 AM) after learning the hard way on day 1. A lot of the main trails have some bathrooms and filling stations along the way. Sight wise, the main attractions in the valley are as good as advertised - Half Dome, El Capitan, falls etc... are amazingly impressive. There are also some gift shops, restaurants, and information centers in the visitor center campus. There are lots of options for all types of visitors - so you can cater your trip to how hard you want it to be - and there are lots of volunteers/park rangers around that can help you with that. My general advice for avoiding the crowds would be to go in June, on the weekdays, and get started earlier in the day. Yosemite is a very unique national park that is definitely worth visiting - I will be returning again.","July 2, 2019",Breathtaking,75,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",5

I began researching for this trip early and am so glad that we heeded the recommendation to stay in the valley. When we drove in mid-day on our first day, it took quite a long time to find parking. I wouldn't want to spend every day of my valuable vacation time in the park searching for parking. I made reservations for Yosemite Valley Lodge 366 days in advance and that was definitely a good move. It was so convenient to walk many places or to take a shuttle if something was further than we wanted to walk. The valley is absolutely beautiful!

We saw Tunnel View and Yosemite Falls. We originally made plans to raft down the river, but all water activities were cancelled because the river was near flood stage. This might get better as the summer progresses. A tip: go during the week day. It was crowded when my family and I visited. Also, this was my 2nd time there.

Note that the driving is done in a loop, with one road labeled as north and one as south. There are only a few cut throughs. So plan your visit in a circular motion or park your car and take the free park shuttles around. The popular Glacier Point is about an hours drive from the valley; so plan your days accordingly.

Yosemite Valley,"Just back from Yosemite. Overall a great experience, but some stress points. If you go during the week, getting there by 9 is best. If you go Fri/Sa/Sunday - you MUST be there by 8 to get a parking spot. Anyone saying to get there by 9 is wrong. That's not early enough. Also, the drive into the park on 120 is ~35-45 minutes (depending if you get stuck behind slow drivers). That can be a little taxing especially at the end of a day when you are tired - then have to drive 40 minutes to exit the park.We stayed at Rush Creek Lodge - which was outstanding. It's not for the thrifty traveller though, but we didn't want any regrets - which you won't have after staying at Rush Creek. We found parking on a Thursday around 1015 - but that was pure luck. Saturday was the same - essentially finding the last spot in the main parking lot at 915-930 ish. I think the best plan is to be there by 8, and leave by 2ish. Most leave around 2-3, so traffic can build leaving the park. We hit all the spots you should. Definately walk to the base of El Capitan - takes a bit of navigating to get there, but it is worth it. We had two kids - (10/13) and we found the lighter hikes (<2 miles) good. The walk to Mirror lake was nice, but as a beginner hike - more challanging than I would have thought. Not so much for me, but for kids who are not accustomed to it. (we're from chicago). This is a trip I will never forget. But just plan a bit in advance. A couple spots a day is good. As is a 3 day trip. More than that - and it's too much driving and or parking stress! (imo).","June 27, 2019",Great trip - but plan accordingly,0,"Chicago, Illinois",5

We got to stand at a short distance beneath its gushing waters, feel the fine spray and see a lovely rainbow in it’s mist. It was exhilarating. One of the best things of going in May was that there were no crowds. We got to drive into and around the park, actually find parking and not have to take shuttles everywhere.

Seeing El Capitan up close totally gives you a sense of scale for how giant it is.

This is a good way to keep the shuttles on schedule.I parked at the Curry Village parking one day so I would be close to the Mist Trail. I knew this would be a longer exit drive from the Valley, but it was a good choice for me. At the end of the day, it took me about 45 minutes to get to the Yosemite Valley Lodge where the traffic finally flowed.I parked at the Yosemite Falls parking one day so I would be close to Lower Yosemite Falls one day (my first destination) and be in a good location to easily exit the Valley.

We made the mistake of stopping at Tunnel view and Bridalvail falls first only because when we left to go to the visitor station there was no more parking. There were signs that kept rerouting us back through the same loop at least 3 times before we figured out how to stop it. We wanted to hike mirror lake but you could not drive back there, only buses could travel the road. I wish someone would have told us to go straight to the parking section and take the shuttles.

Once you get away from congested roads, parking lots, and visitor’s center the park is a wonderful place to visit.That being said, the park really should do something about congestion in the valley. We went on the “shoulder season” to avoid the crowds. It didn’t work. Even in May, the crowds were terrible!! We were there for 3 days. Luckily our first 2 days were on Thursday and Friday. Since we were staying at the Big Trees Lodge we made it into the Yosemite Valley early (i.e., before 9:00 AM) and were able to get good parking spots near the sites we wanted to visit that day. After 10:00 AM, all of the parking spots were full and people started making their own “parking spots” on the side of the road. That created more issues with traffic and plenty of safety hazards. By noon all pretense of politeness from the other visitors was gone. There is a bus system in the valley (the Yosemite Valley shuttle system), but they were always packed with standing room only. Even on Saturday (the busiest day for visitors) the park was using only 6 buses. So we walked almost everywhere, which turned out to be a great move. Once we got away from crowded roads and visitor centers it was a very relaxing and enjoyable visit. Other than the crowds, our biggest disappointment was that Glacier Point was closed.

Yosemite Valley,"As I drove into Yosemite Valley, it was like descending into Rivendell. Indeed, I expected to see elves running and jumping from the granite rocks. It was a surreal experience.There are several hiking trails called the, Yosemite Valley Loop Trail, that traverse the valley floor and which wend along the Merced River thru debris fields of rocks that have been carved off the granite cliffs by glaciers, water and time.I used the shuttles to move back and forth from one of the Yosemite Valley Trails to the other. I especially enjoyed the Trail around Campsite #4 and along the Merced River where I saw trout, coyotes, birds and a wide variety of plant life. I took a day or 2 to walk along the valley floor to experience, away from the crowds, why Native Americans valued this valley and made it their home. I could imagine children playing a form of ball on the valley floor while their mothers gathered plants and worked baskets from the native grasses.It was easy to see why life has always existed and flourished here in this valley.As I walked the valley floor I was amazed that I was walking on land that used to be an ocean basin lifted by the raising of the earth's tectonic plates and then had became an ancient sea formed by the melting of glaciers. The action of plates is still active and though I could not feel the movement around me I knew that it was still growing and moving though very slowly. As I looked above I could see the granite shelves and ridges, Half Dome and El Capitan which had been carved by ancient glaciers and water. All around me water was still active, carving the valley as the winter snow melted and flowed down the granite walls into the valley and the Merced River. As I hiked the Yosemite Valley floor I saw all the life that water was making possible in this valley, coyotes, birds, trout and by hiking early I saw it all in almost complete silence and solitutude.","June 6, 2019","Rivendell, Lord of the Rings comes to life!",66,"Gatlinburg, Tennessee",5

Hopefully you, too, can visit in the spring and enjoy it without a horde of people.","June 1, 2019",Yosemite serenity ,80,"peachtree city, ga",5

Yosemite Valley,"The weather was awful , but the valley lived up to every expectation for scenery and wonder. If you can only do one, come to the Valley rather Wawona.The visitor centre quickly had the measure of our fitness level and provided four hikes that were appropriate for the inclement weather outlook. The recent snow and rain made the falls spectacular. An amazing experience which was worth the discomfort of a cold tent with mud.The village centre evening theatre is worth a visit ( pouring with rain ). We has not packed correctly for snow in May and the roads closed with snow as we left. The organisation and food was worse than desperate...There is not enough parking for the number of weekend visitors, so became gridlocked including the bus lanes, which the ranger seemed to think, laid back was okay. This should be easy to fix by the use of park and ride with some larger parking feeder areas? Actually similar to that introduced at wawona trees visit.At half dome camp, the people were wonderful and a warm recreation lounge with slow Wi-Fi was welcome. The only addition should be hot water for drinks and microwave for camping residents.The only fresh cooked food was the pizza ( reasonable) but the main restaurant for breakfast and meals was 1970 service station, quality and service. A visit to centre parks would give a few lessons in food provision, but there appears to be no appetite for investment?. Coffee and pastries worked well and has a good service ethos.

We did a really nice hike from the Visitors Centre to Mirror Lake.

It's the stuff you see when you turn around too. There are plenty of hiking trails for all kinds of abilities. Some are more popular than others and you might struggle to park if you're driving, so turn up early to get a spot. Signage can be a bit confusing on some of the trails (we never did find Mirror Lake), but once you get past all the housekeeping stuff, it's an amazing destination and well worth a visit.

The staple hotel Ahwahnee, renamed to the Majestic, is VERY expensive, and must be booked way in advance, a bit cheaper in the winter but,,, number 2 is, a few attractions in the park are closed. Some of the falls and trails and The Gentle Giants, the Sequoia Trees, big bummer. We didn't even think to check the conditions. We will be revisiting in June, 2019, but decided to save a bunch of money by booking a motel outside of the park, about a 10 minute ride.

Yosemite Valley,"I have been here twice and my most recent visit was fantastic. I was there in early spring and I think I chose a good time to come. The snow started melting on the peaks which created dozens of extra waterfalls. There were also very few people in comparison to the summer months. The hikes in Yosemite Valley offer nonstop views and photo opportunities. Bridalveil and Yosemite Falls are two of my favorite waterfalls on Earth. Every thing in the valley truly wows me. I should also mention that the Majestic Yosemite Lodge (the Ahwahnee) is a fantastic lodge. We could see Yosemite Falls from our room. The granite peaks are really amazing and I did not expect so much from them. Tunnel View is absolutely fantastic. When I went to the park, I was lucky enough to see rainbows at Bridalveil and Yosemite Falls. I saw a coyote in the valley as well.

Yosemite Valley,"The Yosemite Valley is the heart of Yosemite National Park. It is a lovely area to spend a few days exploring some of the most beautiful outdoors in the States. There are numerous easy, moderate and more challenging hikes throughout the valley. Additionally, visitors will see incredible waterfalls, including Bridalveil and Yosemite Falls as well as the beautiful Merced Rivers which flows through the valley. Other impressive land formations include El Capitan and Half Dome in the distance, these are granite monolith formations, beautifully carved by glacier activity over a million years ago. Within the valley, you will find early 20th century buildings and historic bridges described as National Park Rustic style. They are beautifully set within the environs of the valley. There is village within the valley where you will find the National Park Visitor Centre, educational buildings, Ansel Adams studio, the Village Store and eateries. There are a variety of accommodation options within the valley as well.  Lastly, due to traffic, visitors are encouraged to use the free shuttle buses to help elevate crowded road conditions. We found this useful during our 3 day visit last month.

Yosemite Valley,"This is my fourth trip to Yosemite and it takes my breath away every time. I have done many of the trails in the valley - some are fairly easy and others are quite strenuous, but all are beautiful. I have never been disappointed yet. I typically come in the spring, but the price I pay is that not all of the roads or trails are open yet. In May, they are still in major cleanup mode from winter. LOTS happens here in winter, so it is no small task for them to get things back on track for a busy summer. Plan for traffic in the valley. A somewhat sad statement, but there are so many visitors that it gets congested. Head to the trails early and leave your car somewhere and use the shuttle - it is the easiest way to get around. Do not plan to drive from place to place. Wasteful in every sense of the term. The Park Service does a truly wonderful job with this park.

It was honestly hard to get a good shot up close because you were getting soaked. If you want to get up-close plan to bring a raincoat and a pair of waterproof shoes and prepare for the spray. The falls were all spectacular, but what amazed me most was the amount of water runny through the valley. Words just can not describe it. You have to see the photos. If you have been to the park in the past 6 years, these are a must see. Wow. My 13 and 14-year-old daughters had a great time and they have been to Mount Rainier and to the Great Wall and many places in-between. The loved the water, the green, the flowers, the deer, and the family time.This is not my first time seeing these falls or the park, but this was a special visit with the Dogwoods out, the deer out and ALL the water. The roads were a bit slick. The forecast was for thunderstorms at 2 p.m. with the sun in the a.m. We squeezed everything in before 2 and head to the lodge cafe for lunch and no joke, the storm hit as we sat to eat.

Yosemite Valley,"First stop, right when you clear the tunnel, move immediately (safely) to the left for an amazing view of the valley. You must stop here. You'll regret it if you don't. The Valley is the place to be- with El Capitan, Half dome, Bridalveil Falls, Vernal falls, upper and lower Yosemite falls, mirror lake, soooo many hikes and lots of scenic vistas, this is where you wanna be. You can easily spend two days sightseeing if taking hikes shorter than 3 hours, you need 3-4 days if you want to do some half day/ or full day hikes and sightseeing. We used the South entrance and stayed in nearby Oakhurst (1.5-2 hours Oakhurst to the Valley one way) When I go back, I will make an effort to stay in the Valley to rid myself of the 3-4 hour commute each day, there's just so much to see and do. There is a stop for gas just 20 minutes after that entrance, and a couple restrooms along the way. Once you pass those campgrounds however, there is no place to stop until the valley floor. Bridalveil falls may be the first restroom stop. I did not see any other gas stations in the valley. There are several stores and a few restaurants all in a cluster near the visitor's center. The stores sell everything from frozen food, to fresh meat, and sooooo many prepared sandwiches. To those complaining about crowds- go in the off season and get there EARLY in the morning. Parking can be difficult. There was a shuttle system in service while we were there (mid to late April), it took about 20 minutes to wait for each one, and we were lucky enough to get on a shuttle each time, though towards the 16th stop, they were FULL. So... get in early, if you want to hike, be there at sun up. Park where you can, and walk/bike/or shuttle to where you want to go. Something to note: people with strollers had a HARD time getting on the shuttle when it was full. Be courteous, if there's a crowd waiting, don't push to the front when the bus gets there. Hiking tips - Want to go to the Vernal falls bridge? It's less than a mile! How hard can that be?! There's a 900 foot plus elevation gain. It's harder than it looks. Wear real shoes, good tennis shoes at a minimum, like a running shoe not a converse, hiking boots are better. With those, wear real wool blend socks, or other hiking socks. Even then, bring a first aid kid and mole skin. We saw so many people stopping to care for blisters who had bad shoes, or the wrong shoes. Bring a plastic bag to pack out your trash. Bring water, a good sun hat, flashlight and a compass, as well as a trail map. A friend of mine got lost on a trail in the snow and had to wait for help, had she had a compass and a trail map, she might have gone out sooner. The flashlight because people often lose track of time hiking, you don't want to come back struggling in the dark.

Yosemite Valley,Only just enough parking so don’t arrive too late if going for the day. Misty trail exillerating. Amazing waterfalls and rainbow in the mist. It is quite strenuous for a 60 year old with lots of steps up to the second waterfall. A poncho could be useful in cooler weather. Ok when it’s warm as the mist cools you down and you soon dry off. Mirror Lake is a mirror at the moment but later in the summer I would think there wouldn’t be enough water to create the mirror effect. The path on the right of the lake going further up the valley was flooded so we had to clamber over boulders and fallen trees on a very indistinct path. Later on that path we came across a bear! We were glad we hadn’t bumped into when clambering. I was surprised there were not many wardens/rangers around or a notice to inform us the path was flooded.

Rising early allowed an uncrowded access to all of the most popular sights; by noontime the valley and it's handy shuttles begin to fill up.

To drive through Wawona Tunnel to see the awesome views of El Capitan, Half Dome and Bridalveils Falls is something to behold. Sounds obvious but you really do need to get out of your car and hike around to really appreciate the scale of the place. We went on a week day during in April when the waterfalls were at that majestic best and there was still a lot of snow in the highest parts of the park. Be warned that even at this time of year the main visitor carpark was over-flowing and frankly the infrastructure was struggling to cope. What it would be like during the High Season I can only imagine. I think there is an argument to limit the numer of visitors per day as it would be such a shame for your over-riding memory to be one of the traffic and the queues everywhere rather than the gorgeous scenery. On a footnote I would say it's better to get here early if you can and bring your own food and drink.

Yosemite Valley,"We live in western North Carolina and are use to beautiful waterfalls and mountains, but Yosemite was simply majestic. I only wish we could have stayed longer. If I ever get to go back I'd make sure to wear layers. The weather changed drastically as we drove higher. Mild and partially sunny in the valley and rain/hail and cool up top. Bring decent hiking shoes. When we hiked Mariposa Grove of the Giant Sequoias we started on a paved road since the trail was closed, then some muddy wet areas then a foot of snow to walk through. It was a 7 mile round trip hike but so worth it. The sequoias were simply amazing. There was evidence of damage from all the forest fires which was very sad. The drive in the park is long and many areas without guard rails; just a heads up if that makes you nervous. I saw a lot of tour buses coming in the park. I personally wouldn't be comfortable on those roads on a tour bus. Some roads were still covered with slush and were slick.

We drove up to Badger Pass and went skiing and played in the snow. We drove to Half Dome Valley and saw the village, the camp ground, Yosemite Fall, Glacier Point, and the kids went ice skating. But the highlight of our trip to Yosemite was when we were at the Tunnel View. I think, for me, Tunnel View is the gateway to Yosemite National Park. On the first day we went to Tunnel View, we drove in the tunnel and it was long, and narrow, and dark, probably about 2-3 minutes’ drive. And when we drove out of the tunnel, it opened into this bright and beautiful view of Yosemite. I got really excited. We found parking, got out of the car, and walked over to the overlook. I saw the famous El Capitan and its granite cliff on the left, the Bridalvale Waterfall on the right. And in the center, I saw the Half Dome Valley from afar. And so many giant trees everywhere.

We managed hikes to both waterfalls and a bit of the valley floor before heading back over highway 120 to Groveland. We had a minivan park rangers said we would be fine with chains. We had to put them on at around 3600 feet due to packed snow. Some as high as 5 feet at the side of the road. But we managed it despite the chains not having instructions.

I have arrived from Fresno (Hwy 149), from Tioga Pass, from Merced (Hwy 120) and each of these roads have a different wonderful something to feats your eyes. Coming from Fresno you enter right at the Mariposa Grove (a quick ride from the gate) where you can visit the incredible, gigantic sequoias. If early in the day, on your way to the Valley you can take a detour and go visit the Glacier Point, with an amazing view from about 4,000 feet high. After that, return to 140 and head to the Valley, driving through an incredible tunnel of about 1 mile cut through solid granite. Be prepared to take a left towards the parking area of the vista point immediately after the tunnel. You will be taken to another level as you look at a post card view of all the granite monoliths that surround the valley floor, as well as a couple of beautiful water falls.If you drive from Lee Vining, on CA 395 and climb the Tioga Pass, then you will have a whole different scenery, wirth every second of your time. Coming from Merced, you will drive along the Merced River that is fed by the Yosemite Falls and other sources, beautiful rapids show, and you will pass under an enormous rock hanging rigth over your vehicle.That accounts only for your arrival, as the Valley is another source of amazement.If you vist in winter than you will not be able to drive through Tioga Pass (closed from mid October to April), to Glacier Point amd cannot drive to Mariposa Grove, but the beauty is still there, only different.","January 15, 2019",I WISH I COULD GIVE IT ONE THOUSAND STARS,14,"Altadena, California",5

A good place to start is the Visitor's Center for information and unfortunately the theater wasn't showing its films that give a lot of the history but might be worth seeing to get a sense of the place. (operator issue). Be sure to tour the Native American village out back as that has some nice history too. From there you can walk to some eating places and the post office.

Be warned, although you won't forget what you see at Yosemite, you will forever find yourself frustrated by your inability to describe it to others.","October 29, 2018","Jaw Dropping, indescribable views",257,"Mountain Home, Arkansas",5

Yosemite Valley,"My family and I visited Yosemite last week for a few days. What an amazing place to visit. We only had 2&1/2 days and we definitely could have used a couple more days to explore. Watching the climbers scale El Capitan was incredible. We couldn't look a way. We took a 2 hour valley bus tour (highly recommended) our first morning then explored the valley on our own after that. That afternoon we drove over to Glacier Point. Also hiked up to Sentinel Dome... just breath taking views from up there. Second day we drove up to Tuolumne Meadows and explored all the way there and back. Our last morning we drove out the south entrance and visited Mariposa Grove. We stayed at Yosemite Valley Lodge and found that staying in the Valley is definitely the way to go. You are close to everything you need. We did have traffic in the valley when we drove in on Saturday morning but nothing horrendous. I am glad we came in October. There were lots of people there but not so many that it felt ""crowded"". Our tour guide said it is crazy in the summer months. We also lucked out with good weather. If you are trying to decide whether or not to visit Yosemite, just do it! You won't regret your decision. I would recommend staying in the Valley. ","October 27, 2018",Beautiful Area,21,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5

Yosemite has numerous things to do depending on the time of year like hiking, rock climbing, camping horseback riding, swimming and skiing. If these activities are not on your list, you can just walk around and enjoying the views the wildlife and the wildflowers.

The views around the park are a delight to the eyes and really are not to be missed it at all possible. This really is a must see place and it is obviously from the hoards of cars, RVs, busses, bikes etc that many others think the same way. We entered from route 120 and drove through the park and then on to the Valley. SO many sights along the way from hydro-electric man made lakes to majestic mountains, from rocky streams to cool dark forests. Good job the camera has a strong battery supply and plenty of storage for all the shots you might want to take. Hugely memorable visit and one of the highlights of any visit to the State.

Yosemite Valley,"We went on a wet October weekday. Even at 10am and in the rain there was no parking at all in the two carparks near the main Lodge and Village, just a long stream of cars driving round all looking for a spot and nobody leaving. We gave up and got a space in the Half Dome carpark which was not quite full. The valley is amazing. if you can get away from the crowds it's heaven and we loved the deserted Cathedral Beach and Sentinel Beach. We got a lucky look at busy Bridalveil Fall before the cloud came down over it. The sheer rock faces are extraordinary, it makes you feel so small as you walk the beaches and meadows. We heard Mirror Lake was dry at this time of year so didn't try it.

But it still doesn't take away from how majestic this place really is. The valley has incredible views but if you're looking for a more personal, experience and roughing it a little, Definitely explore outside the valley away from the big tourist areas. You won't be disappointed at any location in Yosemite. Reason for 4 stars is the parking is incredibly difficult to get a spot.

Yosemite Valley,"When we planned our summer trip to San Francisco, my daughter suggested going to Yosemite. I did a lot of research and noticed it was a 4 hour drive. I really didn’t want to rent a car, so I researched tours that went from SF to Yosemite. We used Extranomical Tours (amazing!) for our 2-day trip. Yosemite was far and beyond our expectations!!! The beauty of nature was on display and to be cliche, it was truly breathtaking! Yosemite must be seen to be believed. The pictures we took of Half Dome, El Capitan, and the waterfalls were spectacular. Hiking was unreal, and we saw deer and coyote in the wild. My son hiked up the rocks into the base of Yosemite Falls and he said the view was spectacular! Our overnight stay was at the Yosemite Valley Lodge, which is a quaint and rustic accommodation that fit perfectly in the Valley. The late June weather was perfect—hot and dry! I wish we could have stayed longer and we most definitely plan to be back. This was one of the BEST trips our family took!

Yosemite Valley,"I've been here when the ice is cracking and falling off Bridal Veil Falls and Half Dome is beautifully reflected in Mirror Lake - in other words, Spring. I have also been here when Yosemite Falls is dry and there is a bit left of Bridal Veil and Mirror Lake is all sand - in other words, September. Once I drove into the valley in June and left very quickly as it was all crowds, cars and mosquitoes, so many mosquitoes. I have stayed at Curry Village (or so it used to be called) before and after a one-day hike with 4 gal pals to the top of Half Dome and back. I was in my 50s and I pulled it off, but my toes - ouch and the food at the cafeteria was hardly what one desires after such an adventure. They do have showers there though so, that's good.The walk from The Majestic Yosemite Hotel (I prefer and still call it Awahanee) to Mirror Lake is a long one. It is more interesting if you stay off the road and follow the dirt path around the boulders that parallels the road (more or less). Bike riding is an excellent option. The park, in general, is not receptive to pets. You can have a dog on a leash, but you will be very limited as to the hikes you can take. Vernal/Nevada Falls is lovely in summer - dried up in Fall. Park the car and take the shuttle as much as possible. Expect fairly average food unless you want to pop for hotel restaurant meals. Ansel Adams museum/gift shop is great. The rest is touristy and overpriced for most of what is made in China. Recommend you get off the beaten path, enjoy some serenity and good hikes, take photos. Tunnel view is great and always crowded but Glacier Point is spectacular in the spring for a full view as well as, if you time it right, a great sunrise or moon rise. Now that it is open again, Mariposa Grove is worth the drive. I've stayed up in Tuolomne and driven to the valley for one day, preferring the beauty and serenity of the higher elevation. It is a very long drive each way. I've backpacked to May Lake and Sunrise as well as upper Cathedral Lakes. The last one was a true backpack experience, no services and a bear encounter. The first two were part of the high camps and they offer tent accommodations and food, family style. Sunrise had showers. I thought the environment there was especially nice, but May Lake has a stunning view. Timing at Yosemite is a crap shoot. You can never predict the weather and when the season begins or ends. That's nature!","September 22, 2018",The grandeur and beauty never disappoint!,9,"Auburn, California",5
Yosemite Valley,Having never been here before we didn't know what to expect. One can simply drive most of the day and see lots. OR there is always the free shuttle that stops at all the main sights so you can also park your car and use the shuttle all day. Only frustration is the road leading in and out of the valley - there were many places where it went down to one lane with flagged workmen holding up traffic so getting anywhere coming to or leaving the valley took a long time,"September 22, 2018",There is so much to see,6,,5
Yosemite Valley,"We enjoyed the time we spent in Yosemite, the scenery is undeniably amazing. The largest detractors are the massive amount of tourists, even in late September. We thought that by coming after the “high season” we would have a more natural experience. That was not to be. We visited on a Tuesday and Wednesday. The cars were packed into every parking area from the East Gate entrance all the way into the Valley. Same at Glacier Point. This is unlike any other National Park that we have visited (which must be over 30). I would recommend any of the Utah parks, except Zion, where the crowds are also terrible. Even Yellowstone in mid summer wasn’t as crowded. If you are looking for solitude, you will need to hike far into the back country to get it.","September 20, 2018","Granite, granite everywhere",181,"Hot Springs, Arkansas",4

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite has been on my bucket list forever. It’s even more amazing than I’d imagined. As you drive down into the valley you start to glimpse some amazing views and it’s definitely worth pulling over at Tunnel View for your first view of Half Dome in the distance. Parking in the valley was a bit of a chore but we did arrive at lunchtime. There is a free shuttle bus service that is definitely recommend. It takes you to all areas of the valley and runs frequently. Our first stop off was at the bottom of Yosemite Falls which was dry but still impressive. We saw deer, squirrels and pikas along the trail. The soaring cliffs of El Capitan, Half Dome and Glacier Point are absolutely spectacular. Indescribably beautiful. After taking in the amazing sights we stopped off at Half Dome Village where we enjoyed a drink and some fantastic pizza at the Pizza and Bar.

Yosemite Valley,"It's a pleasure to know and see that beautiful nature areas such as this place is being preserved. The high granite walls are spectacular. The valley floor is lush with forestry and has the Merced River running through it. There numerous hiking trails throughout the park ranging from short day hikes to multi-day hikes that can take you deep into the wilderness. You can even hike all the way to Mt Whitney from here via the Muir Trail. We met a hiker who'd been hiking the High Sierra Trail for the last 27 days...he said he had another 275 miles to go on his adventure. From water falls to wildlife...it's here to see.There are several lodging options from camping to staying in a hotel. We camped ($26/nt) at the North Pines campground...which required making a reservation. There are 3 campgrounds that require advance reservations be made. However, there is Camp Four, which is a walk-in campground (no parking at your campsite).This was my first visit to this park. We went midweek and just after recent nearby fires were no longer creating excessive smoke and haze. So the park wasn't pack (according to my friends who'd visited before). I heard about huge traffic delays at the park entrances...but didn't experience this. I also heard it could be hard finding a parking spot in the village area...but again, didn't experience this. According to my friends, we got lucky with a minimal number of visitors being there. There's also a bike rental outfit. I brought my own bike...which was a great way to see a lot of the floor area quickly. In the village, there are stores and restaurants. There's a building there that has free WiFi...it is across from the pizza patio area. Cell phone reception is iffy too in most places...especially on the hiking trails.The thing that I didn't like, was how densely packed campsites were to one another in the campgrounds. One of my friends stayed in a ""camp tent""...$143/nt. They too were packed in tightly. I've never stayed at a campground where I was literally, right on top of my neighbor. Now you can also camp out in the wilderness...however, there are some rules you'll need to follow...like taking a bear canister with you and needing a ""wilderness permit.""But overall, I really enjoyed my short visit.

The confusing part is that if all the National Parks I have been in this was not easy the first time to get around. Driving was a chore even with aap. Renting Bikes was not easy. I always seemed to park in the wrong place, drive in circles, even renting bikes was not a smooth process once I found them.

Yes, it has natural beauty, but...... the crowds ( and this is after Labor Day ); were horrible. The signage, very poor. We called it Disneyland unmanaged. To be fair, if you are a camper, it would get a much higher rating, you can stay in the park and enjoy it before the crowds arrive, but, otherwise, avoid this park. We strongly encourage you to visit Yellowstone.... top of our list, as is Glacier.

Yosemite Valley,"I heard about Yosemite Valley from my childhood but always questioned myself how to go and roam there? I am not very fond of driving and looking for an option of my own trip in Public transport. I found that it is not difficult to travel to Yosemite valley from Los Angeles or San Francisco. There are very good trains run by Amtrak for going to Merced or Fresno, which are 2 gateways for going to valley by public transport. Both Amtrack bus and Yarts bus starts from there every day and reaches the Valley in 3-3 1/2 hours. Both the bookings are possible from their website in advance.I followed the same. Unfortunately, due to forest fire, Amtrak bus was cancelled as Merced route was closed due to fire. But fortunate to had Fresno route (Highway 41) was open and were able to come Visitors Valley Centre in one of the July 2018 afternoon.We stayed at Yosemite Valley Lodge and came here from Visitor’s centre by valley shuttle.Once I reached Yosemite Valley I faced no issues in transportation as I found there are 2 free shuttle routes- 1. Normal route, which is called Valley Shuttle which covers most of the places and run every day from 7am-10pm.  Valley shuttle covers Yosemite village, Visitors centre, Yosemite Falls, Y osemite Valley Lodge, Half Dome Village, Happy Isles, Mirror Lake and many others. Using bus no 1, we went to Mirror lake, Vernal Falls, Mist Head Trail, Yosemite Falls, Yosemite Village shop and Visitor’s centre.2. In summer season, there is another shuttle catted El Capitan Shuttle which runs from 9am-7pm. It covers mainly Cathedral Beach, Four Mile Trailhead, El Capitan picnic area and Crossover. We went to see Bridal Veil Falls, Merced River and beach, Cathedral Beach using this bus.Overall valley was one of the life time experiences. We stayed for 3 nights, which looked not sufficient and became very sad to leave the valley.","September 6, 2018",My own guide to visit the valley using public transport,589,"London, United Kingdom",5

Yosemite Valley,"There are so many superlatives for this that it is easy to bore and understate the awesome majesty of the place.As you drive in the huge granite sentinels watch over your approach, looming higher and higher into view you drive up the valley craning your neck to see the top. The quiet violence of the ice has passed and the valley is now left to the ephemeral energies of the rivers and water falls that continue to shape it. Humans are a passing leaf in the wind that has had more impact that something as relatively insignificant as us should have had.Wild animals roam the valley floor, drive carefully, there is a one way system in place that is not intuitive, once you are parked, use the shuttle buses, they are free, save you driving and reduce the traffic on the road (I realise that to many Americans this is heresy, but really you should try it). In my view that park should ban cars from driving other than too and from their residence and put on more shuttle busesThere are so many hikes from the valley floor alone that for a short stay you won’t need to go further, getting high requires planning and effort. Be aware that in summer it is dry, the waterfalls are much reduced if not dry, mirror lake is largely gone and the Merced river flow so low that by mid August, no rafting is possible. Do not embarrass yourself by asking for the water falls to be turned on (yes, someone asked this) instead take advantage of the some of the most amazing scenery in the world.","August 20, 2018",Should be on your bucket list,105,"London, United Kingdom",5

Yosemite Valley,"Most people that go to Yosemite National Park are going to end up in Yosemite Valley and for good reason. The place is stunningly beautiful. The views from Tunnel View, Valley View and around Yosemite Falls and Half Dome are amazing. We stayed in the Valley for 3 nights at Yosemite Valley Lodge and it was the perfect base of operations. Yosemite Falls is right behind the hotel, the Valley Floor Trail passes right by and most of the valley is just a handful of bus stops away. The bus system worked well for us, except in the heart of the day, which caused full buses that would skip stops if nobody was getting off. Walking is a great option though as there are sites everywhere, including the occasional bear sighting.We hiked part of the Valley Floor Trail. We took the purple bus line to El Capitan and hiked right to the foot of it and enjoyed the views from the meadow. We hiked the Mist Trail along with everyone else in the valley, or so it seemed! We took an excellent Valley Floor Tour. We also did the short trail to Lower Yosemite Falls.It is a very busy place and the traffic can be bad. We were there during weekdays in June, but I was told the summer weekends get crazy. Everyone will tell you to get into the valley as early as you can. We did the opposite though. We came in from the east down Tioga Road and stopped at all the big sights. We entered the valley around 8:15 PM and there was no traffic. Just a handful of cars. We stopped for some excellent late afternoon views and checked in at around 9:30 PM. It was simple and there was plenty of parking at Yosemite Valley Lodge.

We didn't have to fight traffic or find parking in the morning and saved us a bunch of time. We came in in a Sunday night and spent Monday here. Due to our limited time, we only visited lower Yosemite Falls and took the hike to Mirror Lake. The valley shuttles were so busy and crowded that we sometimes had to wait 2 or more shuttles to get from place to place. People on the shuttle could be really rude. At the end we did walk but that also took alot of time. My only complaint is that we didn't have enough time here!","July 31, 2018","Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!",18,"Stanchfield, Minnesota",5

We stayed in Wowana, South of Yosemite Valley, which meant it was easier for us to get there since we didn't have to enter the park on day we visited since we were already inside the park. From there it takes about 45 minutes. We left early since it can get very busy here and parking is hard, we got a space but when we went to leave it was packed. The staff here are friendly and informative and the whole place has been set up very well, with the shuttles, maps and trails, although some of the signage was a little confusing and misleading. It was pretty busy and some people had to wait for 2-3 shuttles because they were so full but it wasn't so busy that you couldn't walk comfortably.

Yosemite Valley,"The Valley has some amazing jaw dropping views. No disagreement there. Sadly, I could not see them because there was a large fire in the park and you could only see white in the valley. The reason, I did not give this 5 stars however is that the signage is just awful. It is very easy to get lost especially if you rely on your GPS---We kept going back and forth trying to find the Glacier Point turn until we finally realized the GPS was not following the road, but just pointing to the site on the mountaintop. Once you miss a turn, you will have to continue driving to finish the one way road. Also, this park is huge. Be prepared to drive and drive and drive.

Yosemite Valley,"What can I say. Yosemite National Park is incredible. However much time you allow to visit will not be enough - it is vast and has so much to see and do. If you have decided to visit then you know what you are going for, so my tips are for those that only have a short visit of a day or two in the summer. So no long hikes included.First thing is book your accommodation well ahead of time, don’t leave it to the last minute. If you can, stay in the valley. If you can’t, stay at a motel on the road in to the valley from Merced/ Mariposa.Make sure you have a full tank of fuel when you enter the park. You will be driving - a lot, and as it is mostly at low speed, up and down hills, stop/start, your fuel consumption will be awful.Make sure you take plenty of water and plan for lunch on the move. There is a store to buy food, ready made sandwiches, etc. in the valley, but chances are you won’t be there are the right time, so plan ahead.OK, so what to see. I’d start in the valley with El Capitan Meadows, it is just glorious on a nice summer day. Park up and from here you can turn 360 and have phenomenal views in every direction, with El Capitan dominating the landscape. It is the ideal place to take a break and walk around if you have had a long drive in. Just a short distance on is Cathedral Beach, another great place to stop.While in the valley a visit to Yosemite Fall is essential, if there is time then take the walk up to the upper falls. Personally I preferred Bridalveil Fall, so if you have to choose one, go for the latter. If you like a bit of clambering over rocks, this is also the place to do it.Heading out of the valley, Tunnel View is another must do place. The view down the valley from here is truly amazing. Head on up to Glacier Point where there are great views of Yosemite Valley, Half Dome and the High Sierra. There are several great places to stop for other views on the way, especially Washburn Point with the best views of Vernal and Nevada Falls.Finally head to Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias. This is barely scratching the surface of what Yosemite has to offer, but is a great introduction to some of the main sights when you are on a tight schedule.","July 20, 2018","Amazing, amazing, amazing...",97,"Marlow, United Kingdom",5

Yosemite Valley,"Unfortunately we only had 5 hours here (we took the YARTS transportation system from Mammoth Lakes and whilst it was great, the timings weren't. The bus time didn't allow enough time to do any to the tours and only gave time for a whistle-stop tour of the valley). Despite our brief visit, it is undeniably beautiful. We have travelled many places and this is definitely up there with one of the most amazing places of natural beauty. We certainly wish we had longer-- I think at least 3 days! Especially to do Glacier Point. But were still grateful to see what we did here.We headed straight to the information and got maps and figured out the best way to spend our time. We spent some time by the waterfalls then did a hike to the west of the valley to the vernal falls bridge. The public transport system in the valley is great but just be prepared for it to be busy and you may have to wait a while (depending when you go)!Also, take plenty of water! The food and drink range in the valley stores is really good anyway. but we went early June and needed several litres of water to keep hydrated.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite is so beautiful. If you ever get a chance to visit, take advantage. We stayed outside of the park and drove in daily. There is a fee of $35 to enter but is good for a week. Go early as the parking fills up early. Be there before 9:30 am. There is free bus system to get you around the valley. There are beautiful views every where you look. We did the Vernal Falls hike. It is fairly mellow to get to the foot bridge. But we decided to hike to the top. That is very strenuous. It is a 3 mile hike with a 1000 ft elevation gain. I am a fairly active person an could hardly walk for the next few days. Maybe leave that one to the end of the visit. I also highly recommend the bus tour that takes you to the top of Glacier point.

And, there was clean-up going into the park after the fires in 2017, so you can expect slower traffic at times. However, overall, traffic was not bad at all.

Yosemite Valley,"A little background: our family is a seasoned traveling family and we traveled across the US with one small carry-on and a backpack for each person. This strategy aided in our ability to check into the hotel in Fresno with only our backpacks (I had packed overnight clothes and toiletries in the backpacks) and leave our suitcases in the car. When traveling with young children, less is more when it comes to one-night stays and need for fast transitions. I had no idea how important this actually was, until we witnessed how congested Yosemite National Park got in the afternoon. Trust me, you don’t want to dilly dally in a hotel or camp site if you want to make the most out of your day in Yosemite.Family friendly (easy and flat) day hikes at Yosemite Valley:Bridalveil Fall: a 0.5 round-trip; 20-minute (80 feet elevation change) hike leads from the parking area via a paved trail to the base of this waterfall.Lower Yosemite Fall: (wheelchair accessible): 1.1-mile loop trail which takes 30 minutes with an elevation change of 50 feet.Cook’s Meadow Loop: (wheelchair Accessible): 1 mile 30 minutes mostly level trail.Mirror Lake Trail: 2-mile trail to the lake and back. Elevation change of 100 feet. This was our family’s favorite trail. We could have spent hours there.Yosemite National Park is massive and is broken up in to 6 major areas: Yosemite Valley, Glacier Point, Wawona and Mariposa Grove, Tioga Road and Tuolumne Grove, Tuolumne Meadows and Hetch Hetchy. Due to our one-day trip to Yosemite, we decided to maximize our time and spend our day at Yosemite Valley prior to continuing our drive to San Francisco.Pro tips:- Arrive at Yosemite National Park as early as possible. If you don’t rise early, you are likely to encounter heavy congestion, especially in Yosemite Valley. We saw folks driving around in circles for hours attempting to find parking near the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center. Don’t be like them. The park’s printed materials warn of 2 to 3-hour delays, especially in the summer afternoons and weekends.- Yosemite day visitors can park in three major parking lots: Yosemite Falls parking Lot, Yosemite Village Park Lot and at Half Dome Parking lots and then take advantage of the free shuttles to get to destination of choice.- Park roads are steep, narrow and winding. Make sure to downshift even when driving an automatic car, in order to prevent car damage. If you or your kids get motion sick, do take motion sickness medication. You’ll thank me later.- Wear sunblock and insect repellent. Ticks can carry lyme disease and prevention is key to enjoying these national parks.- National parks are the natural habitat of wild animals such as bears, rattlesnakes, deer, cougars and others. Please educate yourselves and your children on safety and respect prior to exploring.","July 14, 2018",Amazing Day in Yosemite with 4 young kids,240,"Avon, Connecticut",5
Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite National Park was on my bucket list for many years. I'm so happy I was able to plan a family camping trip here over the summer! We spent three magical days in the valley, staying at Lower Pines Campground. The kids loved seeing all the waterfalls and meadows full of deer. Everywhere you look is a postcard-worthy photo op. Many of the waterfalls have paved pathways that are safe and easily accessible for little kids. We didn't do the mist trail because I had read that it was slippery and dangerous for kids. My brother took his kids, despite my warning, and they turned back around quickly. But most other trails were great and easy. One of the best things I did was to download a Yosemite park app on my phone before we left for our trip. The cellphone reception is terrible up there and the apps work on GPS when you are out of range. It helped immensely with directions (telling us when to turn on the windy roads) and also provided some fun facts about the history and wildlife of the park. I download a guide every time I visit a national park now. Saves a lot of time!","July 13, 2018","Don't hesitate, visit Yosemite Valley!",192,"San Diego, California",5
Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is always beautiful. Summer 2018 is not one of the higher water years which made Yosemite Falls a bit underwhelming, but it made the Merced River a joy to play in! Note there is a shuttle driver shortage this year (possibly because they had to divert some to Mariposa Grove which opened June 15th), so it took a lot longer than usual to get around. We often had to wait for two, three or even four shuttle buses before we could get on. Plan accordingly and it won't be a big deal. I wanted to mention that around 9:30am I noticed all of the parking lots had plenty of parking available. Middle of the day you will drive around for a long time to get a parking spot, but by 4pm they really start to clear out.

Yosemite Valley,"We stayed at Angel's Camp and drove into the Park at 7:45 am before the rangers were manning the booth, but showed them our annual pass at 8pm when we left. It took another half hour to get to our first stop at Bridal Veil falls. It was cool on the brief walk to it's base, and a popular photo op for all. We then drove further in as far as we were allowed, turned around and came back a bit to park our car for the day. We walked Cook Meadow Loop, taking pictures of antlered deer, and visiting the lower Yosemite Falls. At Yosemite Village we saw a brief movie, and looked up at the Arches. We then took a shuttle back in as far as we could to the Nature Center at Happy Isles so we could hike the John Muir trailhead up to the bridge near Vernal Falls. My wife had a Lynx walk behind her 7 feet away as we rested near the top. A gentleman watched it transpire and didn't start saying ""Lynx!"" until the cat went down the rocks away from us. We then walked down to the Mirror Lake trail and followed it up to the lake, getting us closest to Half Dome, and later returned to find a huge line down at the shuttle stop, so we hiked further down to another bus stop that people might actually get off the bus at, so that we could get on. The shuttles were packed, running 5 of their 10, apparently because they couldn't employ sufficient drivers to run the buses efficiently.Once back at our car we drove up to Glacier Point, stopping along the way to see Vernal Falls and Nevada Falls. After the view looking down on the valley where we spent our day, we popped into the gift shop for an ice cream, and were offered 5 free hot dogs and a veggie lasagna for our supper as they were closing up the kitchen. They also had water fountains for us to fill our bottles having consumed all the water that we brought with us.

That was the best decision. Except, don’t think the park staff will let you have air for your tires! We went to the bike rental shop because my tires needed air and they said their pump was “broken” with 100 bikes there to rent. A lady had told me before that she asked last year and they said the same thing. The bike path was great and we did have fun.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley was the highlight of a recent one day trip through the park. We entered thru the east entrance on Tioga Pass. Once thru the gates, it was a two hour drive to the valley floor. My family of four (kids ages 12 and 10) handled the hiking and stopping for photo opps well. We hiked to Lower Falls and Mirror Lake. The Lower Falls area was super fun with tons of boulders to climb on and water to get in. Mirror Lake was also a very cool hike with boulder formations to climb on along the path (not part of the path). There is hardly a bad view in the valley. Beauty is everywhere. We found a parking spot at the Majestic Hotel and used the shuttle to get from place to place. The shuttle was easy to use. We only had one long wait for one, at about 30 minutes. All other shuttles arrived within minutes of us walking up to a stop. We didn’t have nearly enough time during a one day trip to enjoy all the park, or even just the valley had to offer.

Yosemite Valley,"We had an engrossing time in Yosemite Valley and this was our second visit to the national park. We covered the north side this time. This beauty was not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierras.While enjoying the captivating view, we also had a great opportunity of enjoying wild life.... DEERS grazing without a care of its surroundings, MARMOTS (stocky, short-legged, and typically short-furred and burrowing ground squirrels) basking on rocks, an undisturbed ROBIN and a SQUIRREL scrambling in my path looking for food. The walk down Toulemne River was the most memorable witnessing SPECKLED TROUT in midstream, and a school of CUT-THROAT TROUTS in a pool in the rivulet near the path when we exit the trail.The touring of Lambert Dome, the long walk of Tuolumne River and the famous Bridal Veil Fall was fascinating. Walking around the entire base of the dome and exploring the persistent life that grew around it was simply mind blowing and that made me wonder how these living things could survive in many cracks and crevices of the hard granite.The 620 feet plunging Bridal Veil Fall is the first waterfall you'll see when entering Yosemite Valley. The rocks and boulders above the viewing platform are slippery even when dry; it is better to stay safe on the paved trail and scrambling off trail in this area has led to serious injuries. I adhered to every precaution while descending, and inspite of that I tumbled and landed real hard on my face when I weaved amongst the dense tourists at the viewing platform. I was lucky to end my visit to Yosemite with some visible bruises and swelling.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley has many activities such as shops, hotels, dining establishments, etc. but it also is the hub for many hiking trails to other parts of the park. There is a transit system that will take you to many trial heads in the valley for FREE. You can also get a bus to Glacier Point from the Yosemite Valley Lodge or Mariposa valley. Both excellent attractions. In addition, you can book tours of the valley floor at the various hotels and visitor's center. The tours will give you some history of the park and the environment in general. So if you have never been to Yellowstone this should be your starting place.

Yosemite Valley,"When it comes to the great national parks not just of the US, but the world, Yosemite is typically up there w/ Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon.While its instantly recognizable granite cliffs/domes and waterfalls are, indeed, memorable, the park didn't leave the strong impression many other national parks have. For my money, I prefer the mind-blowingly beautiful national parks of the Canadian Rockies or Olympic NP in Washington state. Yosemite is also the NP which requires the most advance planning whether you visit for a day or are backpacking its wilderness (which my wife and I intended to do).A few tips and observations:1) Read the 1 and 2 star reviews on this site and you'll see a common theme: this park gets way overcrowded. Simply, the infrastructure just doesn't exist to handle such crowds during the peak summer season. The entrance stations are small and everybody descends upon Yosemite Valley all at once. It doesn't help that the loop road system here is rather confusing, parking is relatively scarce, and the shuttle system in place just cannot handle the demand. The best I can recommend is arrive early. We stayed in Merced (about 70 miles west of the park) and left for Yosemite at 6:00 AM. We arrived around 7:30-8:00 and found parking rather easily on a Sunday morning in late June. However, even this may not be enough during July-August (a ranger confirmed it will only get worse in those months). Parking lots will likely be full by 10:00 and we saw one car get towed.2) Research what you to want to see before you come to the park. I cannot stress this enough, especially for destinations in the Valley. The shuttle system in place takes 20-30 minutes between buses despite the relatively small area to be covered. The various shuttle stops and what is located there is rather vague and, frankly, confusing unless you study it beforehand. There are about 20 stops but most people only get off at the more popular destinations (Vernal Falls, Half Dome Village, parking lots). Honestly, they could remove half of the stops without affecting anybody's plans, IMO. Most of the adjacent stops can be easily walked and you'll end up saving time. I recommend picking 2 stops to see in the Valley and utilizing the shuttles to travel between them.3) Don't underestimate how HOT it can get in Yosemite Valley. It was in the high 90s each day we were there. From what I experienced, outside of the highlands reached by Tioga Road, the weather around the park will mirror that of the weather in neighboring cities like Merced.4) Now for the hiking - most of the highlights of the Valley can be seen via paved trails. For true trails, most destinations can only be reached by quite long (10+ mile) day hikes. For those interested in backpacking, there is a system in place which can is both aggravating and time-consuming. Again, the key is planning in advance as much as possible.5) The wilderness permit procedure - we've hiked and camped in numerous national parks and Yosemite has, by far, the most frustrating process in place. First, whether you are interested in backpacking or car camping, you'll definitely need to book at least 3 months in advance to secure your choice spot. For backpackers, a wilderness permit is required - there is a quota per trailhead with only 60% of those permits available for advance purchase (about $15). The remaining 40% permits are available on a first-come, first-serve basis starting at 11:00 AM the day prior to your planned trip. At that point, permits can be granted, but there is no guarantee. Another catch: there are several permit stations located throughout the park (Yosemite Valley, Tuolomne Meadows, Wawona). Those applying for a permit in person at that regional permit station get first crack at permits for trailheads in that region. Confused, yet?We finalized our decision to backpack Yosemite 2 months prior to our trip date; of course, all the top trails were already booked for the entire summer. Therefore, my plan was to book something available (Rancheria Falls) while applying for our desired trailhead (Sunrise Lakes to Clouds Rest) in person; I felt our chances were small in getting the latter, but we would at least try.Enter the day of our arrival to Yosemite. I go to the Yosemite Valley Permit Station and am advised that the temperature in Rancheria Falls is hovering around 100 degrees and backpacking there is pretty much out of the question. The ranger tells me she can add our names to a list (this is around 9:30), but we'll need to return at 11:00 to go through the permit process. We also should have a few different desired trails in mind and we can focus on the highland trails off Tioga Road.Here's the problem with this process: planning is virtually impossible. It's just the luck of the draw. Backpacking requires a firm understanding of what kind of trail you're about to hike (elevation, water availability, etc.). To make matters worse, there are no designated campsites, you can camp ""anywhere"" as long as it's not within 4 miles of the trailhead. This may be appealing to some, but such a system doesn't guarantee everyplace will be appropriate for camping.After wasting an hour and a half waiting for 11:00 to roll around, we go back to the permit station. After being forced to read the ""rules of camping"" aloud while taking turns like we're in grade school, the rangers go through the list in order of arrival.Long story short - we ended up getting Sunrise Lakes, much to our surprise. However, I find it a rather odd system where a walk-up permit is easier to obtain than a pre-booked one. I also was advised I would need to pay for a new permit (understandable), but another ranger said these walk-up permits are free. 6) Backpackers can camp in a site designated for backpackers ($6 per person per night); the one in Tuolomne Meadows was right next to a car camping site which led to both sites sharing water and bathrooms (a bit awkward). Also, we arrived late in the evening and all the sites were already taken, so we just had to fine some flat area that was available.7) Information regarding trails is surprisingly lacking; after all the effort to obtain the permit, lack of water sources and the knowledge that we would have to pack all our water to the Clouds Rest summit led to us cutting our night of camping short. I blame myself for lack of thorough planning in that regard, but again, the permit system and lack of defined campsites makes this a very real possibility.8) The rangers were amongst some of the least helpful and unprofessional I've ever encountered. One ranger was chatting for a half hour with the first people she served for the wilderness permit while 10 other people had to wait. Another ranger didn't know the weight of the park's ridiculously bulky bear canisters. The overall tone was rather rude.Overall, I believe seeing the best of Yosemite is possible from the scenic overlooks available from the road, IMO. Though the park is a must-visit for anybody who enjoys natural beauty to even a small extent, overcrowding and the overall infrastructure of the park will likely take away some of that enjoyment. Though I enjoyed our time at Yosemite, I felt like I didn't get the most from the experience and have enjoyed many other national parks a great deal more.","July 2, 2018",Legendary Scenery - Plan Well or Pay the Consequences,198,Chicago,4

Very disappointing that the park caters to day visitors and not those staying in the park.","June 26, 2018",Great place to stay.,165,Pennsylvania,4
Yosemite Valley,"I’m way past my hiking days, so I was unsure about how much you would see the park on the driving tour route. I was pleasantly surprised. Magnificent views, valleys and rock formations. It’s so very pretty. Some of the trails were pretty easy so we were able to walk a bit. This park needs to be on everyone’s bucket list of things to see. For those who hike and camp, there are many amenities offered. Lots of places to pull over and enjoy the views and parking and picnic areas available. I’m so glad this area was preserved as a National Park it’s a National treasure.

Yosemite Valley,Yosemite National Park is wonderful. It's just another piece of California that is vastly different from the rest of the State. We spent a full day here (approx seven hours) and felt that we saw a lot in that time. We didn't leave disappointed at all. We drove Hwy 120 into the park and it was majestic seeing the mountains come into view (and seeing them leave in our rear-view mirror on the way back). We went in April so we were able to see the snow-capped mountains and the waterfalls were plentiful as the melting snow flowed from the mountain tops. Be sure to check out the view from Glacier Point. It is viewpoint above Yosemite Valley and is located on the south wall of the Valley. At an elevation of 7214 feet it is well worth the wait as you try to get a parking spot. The park is huge - so except for Glacier Point (and trying to get a place to park there) you don't feel as though you are being crowded by people.,"June 25, 2018",Yosemite National Park - Worth The Trip!,95,"Hamilton, Canada",5

The falls were gorgeous, all of the scenery was beyond description with all of the green meadows and sounds of nature. We wish we had more than a day to soak it all in. Next time we'll be better prepared to take in some hiking. Re parking: we read that, during peak travel times, arrive early, find a place to park, and leave your car. Take their free shuttle to the different locations around the park. The day we visited, a Wednesday, we arrived @9am. Parking lots were filling quickly, and by 11:30am we heard they were all full. We found that taking the shuttle buses worked well, though they tend to fill quickly.","June 24, 2018",Gorgeous park,10,"Willows, California",5

If you are driving in for the day, I would suggest arriving before 9 am if possible and grab the first parking spot you can find.

Yosemite Valley,"Ok, I have been visiting Yosemite since 1965, so this was not my first trip. I am not a fan of the old vendor and the problem with who owns the names of the iconic places. But this trip was pretty strange. It is June and the schools are out but there were no crowds anywhere I went. The Merced and waterfalls are full and beautiful. The valley is pretty green and with the new traffic circles and flow, the parking and driving was pretty easy.The curry village area was clean and the stores are well maintained. The only issue is that the employees seem to be unhappy and just not focused. The YOSEMITE merchandise is bland and without any imagination.But the park itself was fantastic. i am going back in august and I know the falls will most likely be ribbons but it is place to just relax.Advice hike out of the valley on one of the many trails, once you get a few hundred feet in there are no crowds. Bring plenty of water and just take your time. Slow and steady wins the race here.","June 24, 2018",Relax and fresh air,11,Toluca Lake,5
Yosemite Valley,"Absolutely amazing! Stunning views everywhere you look, the waterfalls were beautiful. We had just over a day there but wished we had longer as we could have easily spent longer just walking and admiring the views. If you're driving into the valley try and get there early as by lunchtime all parking places were full and cars were just driving round waiting for spaces, once parked use the free shuttle bus to get round.","June 24, 2018",Amazing!,3,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",5
Yosemite Valley,"Don't get me wrong the park is a beautiful place and everybody should visit it at least once but after all the years of talking about going there and watching all the TV shows and documentaries I guess my expectations were a little high. Of course it is a beautiful Valley but most of the views are obscured buy trees and vegetation. You can walk the trails to see the waterfalls but to get an overall View you have to just find the right spot. The best view of the valley is the tunnel view parking lot where you can see the whole valley and some water falls from its location. An even better view is Glacier Point if you get a chance to get up there. The park is known for its historical aspect, waterfalls and hiking. There's plenty of easy walking with in the park along paved paths to different locations. These paths are shared with the people on bicycles so if you have small kids be careful they can get run over because the bikers seem to think they have the right away. And from what I saw it looks like some of these people haven't been on a bike in a while. There is a free shuttle system to get you around to different locations in the park but it is very overcrowded and takes awhile to get anywhere. From what I heard from some of the employees it sounds like the new park concessionaire has made some cutbacks which may be the problem. To me the biggest problem was as always the tourist which of course I am one. All the people and all the cars just took the fun out of it. If you're going I recommend you stay a couple of nights in the park because the best time is the mornings before all the day-trippers get there and in the evenings after they left. Definitely glad we went but if I were ranking national parks I would have to put this one below Yellowstone, Zion, Bryce and Grand Canyon.","June 23, 2018","Expecting a ""WOW"" but only got a wow",25,"Round Rock, Texas",3

Yosemite Valley,"There is nothing I could write that would describe the beauty of Yosemite as well as seeing it with your own eyes, smelling the air and feeling the water on your feet - and dodging the dive bombing Stellar jays. When I was a child in the early 1960's my parents took us on several camping trips to Yosemite. Back then, the bears were all over the roads. We saw more deer and other wildlife than I think you will see today. People have learned not to feed the bears so they are less likely to wander into your camp or come try to stick their head in your car window. It's much safer now, although, as I recall, we humans must not have realized how much danger we were in back when we were still throwing peanuts at the bears. I shudder to think of what would happen now since there is about 10 times the number of cars going through the park as there was back then. The valley is definitely a place to stop and look around. You can see several landmarks from the area as well as sit in the shade, put your feet in the water, and stop for a bite to eat.","June 20, 2018",Yosemite speaks for itself.,7,"Martinez, California",4

We were on a whistle stop tour doing Yosemite, Death Valley and Sequoia so we were only here for a day and travelled across the Tioga Pass, it was nothing more than stunning. We were really lucky that the pass was open as it can be much later and would be a massive circumnavigation if not open. There are just wonderful photo opportunities at every corner whether it is mountain views with snow, deep valleys, alpine meadows, waterfalls, babbling booker and streams with rapids. Words and photos cannot describe.

Yosemite Valley,"It is my impression that most visitors to Yosemite National Park stay along the north and Southside roads as they tour the valley without venturing into the meadows that make up the center of the valley. This is really unfortunate because the beauty of the meadows is remarkable and some of the very best views of the landmarks (e.g. Yosemite Falls, Bridalveil Fall, Half Dome, El Capitan, etc.) are seen from locations inside the meadows and along the Merced River that meanders through the valley.SUGGESTION: We used our first day in the park to ride the free hop-on hop-off shuttles from stop to stop. Most stops were for things to see along the perimeter of the valley, but we made a point of also crossing the road and walking through each of the meadows. Don’t miss these paths. They are so easy to walk and the views from them are amazing. Our second day, we drove out to Glacier Point and all viewpoints along the way for views of the valley from above. This worked well, giving us many different perspectives of each aspect of the valley and the landmarks.","June 16, 2018","Amazing, but Often Overlooked and Underappreciated",600,"West Lafayette, Indiana",5

Saw plenty of wildlife on our visit. We parked just outside the village on the roadside because on our previous visit we had difficulty finding a parking spot on the large car parks. We had a short walk to view all of the sites, something you must do when you visit because there is so much to see and you miss it if you drive from place to place. We took a picnic because places to eat are always full.

Vernal Falls, El Capitan and the Merced River were fun for the whole family. Many easy hikes for our kids. Glacier Point was a long hour one way but was worth it - we were thankful for the small cafe with lunch and ice cream. We had to circle a couple times before luckily finding a parking spot. Arrive there early in the morning or late afternoon for better luck with parking - and don’t try to tow your trailer cause there is no room for that.It felt like we had left America as there were way more international tourists compared to American tourists - we enjoyed meeting and hearing their stories.

Oh, and the guy we paid the $35 park entrance fee to said “We don’t take $100 bills and no place in the valley does either.” He lied.

If you walk a bit, there are many areas of the park with little to no people, even in busy July. The noticeable difference between Yosemite and other great parks like Yellowstone, Zion, Grand Canyon, was that I spotted no large wildlife in the valley. Not a single deer, or bear, or coyote, or anything else. That was a little odd, and sad. Otherwise, you are met with some of the most incredible vistas on the planet.

Once a certain number of vehicles are out there you cannot dtive out and then the only access is via the free bus. Although the free service is good it severely limits your ability to just stop and literally smell the wildflowers.","May 30, 2018",The Beauty ,45,,5

Yosemite Valley,"We took state route 41 into Yosemite Valley, Coming out of the Tunnel is a sight to see, I tried to find the valley view in the beginning but couldn't find it as its not marked, I only came upon it when we were leaving and decided to pull over to get a final shot when I realized I was at the valley view.Seeing the monolithic rocks is a sight I'll never forget. We parked and they have a bus that'll take you around Yosemite Valley. From the parking lot its about a mile to get to Yosemite falls, so we took the bus there and it only took about 15 minutes from there to the fall, took some nice shots and headed back.I recommend everyone at least once in your life to visit this park.We wanted to see the Sequoia Tree at Mariposa Grove but our luck they closed it the day we arrived for improvement. So we missed seeing these giant trees on this trip.funny thing is when we arrived we showed our pass to get in, but when we we're leaving we had to show our pass again. thats the first time in all the national parks I've been too where you have to show your pass to leave.","May 29, 2018",Must see,6,,5

Yosemite Valley,"LocationLocated in California state, 2-3 hours drive from San Francisco. Experience One of the largest national park in US, spread in a huge land. There are several entrances for the park it depends which direction you are coming from. The moment you enter the park you will find yourself in a totally different world just 2.5 hours from San Francisco City to this place there are two different worlds. Beautiful landscape waterfalls forests all so beautiful around u. You feel like in the laps of nature. Waterfalls are the most amazing things to watch. You can do the hiking as well if you want to reach some of the high spots to have the better view of the waterfall there are guided tours as well for that. The place is really amazing for the camping, u get ur stuff and u are all set for the fun. There is a tunnel I exactly ant tell u which entrance u should take for that but luckily we entered from there and the guard at the entrance specially told us about that. The moment we crossed the tunnel it was a jawdropping view from there oh my goodness gracious. Just stay there for a while take lots of picture and carry on. The entrance for the park is 20-30$ per person its a whole day pass, keep the tickets safe just in case u go out of the park so u can get in again, otherwise u have to pay again. We saw deers on the way, There are caution boards on the way saying drive carefully the deers might pass and jump. Overaal an excellent experience. The place is perfect for the wildlife or nature lover.ServicesThere are several hotels hotels within the national park and few are outside the park as well. So if u have plans to stay there is a place to stay. There is a shopping mart as well inside the park and a huge parking area, you can buy food soveniers and almost everything u needed there. All and all a really great place to be worth spending each moment and each dollar u spend.I hope this will be helpful for you.","May 23, 2018",Heavens feeling ,7,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",5

After that we went to the gift shop and visitor center, definitely a lot of cool things in there. Then we took a short stroll over to Yosemite Falls, it was so breathtaking, you could feel the mist from a distance. It was so loud and honestly I didnt want to turn away from it. I was here on memorial day and staff told us, it was probably one of the worst days to go. It was SO crowded. My dad couldn't even find a spot to park so that we could walk over to yosemite falls, so he had to drop me off and keep driving around until a car left. It was kind of insane the hoards of people there. I get really annoyed easily when tourists are rude and disrespectful of the park and there was definitely some of that happening.

Yosemite Valley,"I have been in Yosemite many times and in different months and it only seems to become worst. The park can do something about this but it’s mostly the people that come here that make it a bad experience. 1. There are 5 - 10x too many people here2. Most of the people are just insanely lazy and selfish, they stop suddenly on the road, make you wait so they can park in the very first parking spot while there are lots of spots available 200 yards down the road. Same with the toilets, massive line at the first set while the last 3 sets are completely empty. 3. Slow people don’t use the turn outs so you and 30 other cars will be stuck behind a slow driver for 26 miles :) So what should you do?Take the Tioga pass make frequent stops to enjoy the beauty, head to the valley, stop at Valley View, enter the valley and go straight to Tunnel view, fight for your right to see it, get back in the car ASAP and make a run for the coast or south to sequoia.

Yosemite Valley,"We love Yosemite. The views are stunning and indescribable. I’d recommend going on a weekday and spending at least 2 days if you like to hike as the weekends are swarming with people. When hiking plan in advance as some hikes have limited numbers allowed each day. If you’re a backpacking do research on you tube to know what to expect on each trail and know that permits may be needed months in advance. For sightseeing if you don’t want to drive yourself there are Yarts buses available for tours. I’ve been here many times but this was only the second time for my wife, has limited mobility. We were able to go to Glacier Point and though steep she was able to make it up the paved trail with her cane. We did see a man able to push an elderly person on a wheelchair but it was quite steep. Also the car turnouts were nice for viewing without long hikes for my wife. There could be more parking spaces in the turnouts as we had to do the loop a couple of times. The cuts in funding for National Parks was evident by lack of personnel in the gift shop / village store which made for such long lines that we almost left. If my wife wasn’t diabetic and needed a snack we would have. The food stand by the village store was overpriced and not great, but edible.

Yosemite Valley,"It has been 20 plus years since I last visited Yosemite Valley, but the beauty and majesty of the place hasn’t changed. I took my sister and brother-in-law (from France) on a day trip on 4/2/18. It was just a little over 3 hours drive on Highway 120. We hiked to Yosemite Falls, Mirror Lake, and toured The Majestic Hotel Lobby (Ahwahnee). Yosemite Falls and Mirror Lake’s trails are paved, flat, and easy for all ages and abilities. You can walk from one attraction to the next, but we chose to take the free shuttle to the trailheads. I’d recommend getting a Trail Map, because it lists the different stops the different shuttles make. They usually give you one along with the Park Brochure upon paying the entrance fee, but we didn’t get one on this trip. That made catching the shuttles a little difficult, because we didn’t know which shuttle went to which Trailhead! The a.m. Shuttle Driver was very patient and helpful, but the driver we encountered in the afternoon was neither patient or helpful. I told her where we were trying to go to and her response was “on or off? You’re holding up the process here.” In regards to GPS navigation, the Park’s website said to not rely on GPS for navigating in the Valley, but I didn’t have any issues using mine getting in and out of the Valley. I had full bars at the Visitor Center, but that dropped to 2 bars the further into the Valley we walked. A friend thought it was nuts for us to do a day trip, but we were able to do everything we wanted to do during the 6 hours we spent in the park. We all agreed it was definitely worth the long drive! In regards to getting there, Highway 120 is faster but there are hairpin turns on that route! You also don’t get that iconic vista turnout where you can see the entire valley. In the future, I’d take the longer less curvy Highway 140.","April 6, 2018",Majestic!,17,"Brentwood, California",5

The crowds can be awful in the summer, so I highly recommend spring or fall if at all possible, but know that in the fall the waterfalls are often dry or just a small trickle. Also, I highly recommend staying overnight in the valley if at all possible to get the full experience of being here.

If you’re entering the park from the south, your first view of the valley is amazing from tunnel view. This place is truly awe inspiring. I know people say winter isn’t the best time to visit because a lot of the waterfalls aren’t flowing, but I disagree. It is beautiful in winter and not crowded at all.

We spent a full day in the park, but we could easily have spent 2 or 3 days. This park exceeded all expectations, which were already sky high. We saw El Capitan, Half Dome, Yosemite Falls, and many others. There are numerous walking trails, shops, eateries, and of course spectacular scenery. I would say that every American should visit this park at least once in their lifetime. We have visited most of the national parks, and this is definitely in the top 2 or 3. It is comparable to the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone in its uniqueness and beauty. It was difficult to get to, because one road in was temporarily blocked by a rock slide, and the other was blocked by a wildfire, but it was well worth the effort.","March 22, 2018",Exceeded very high expectations!,19,"Morris County, New Jersey",5

The drive to get there is long but she's worth every mile it takes to get to her. The valley is filled with grasses and flowers with deer. The mountains peaking from above. There is a lodge on the valley grounds as well. Camping all throughout the park. Many easy trails noted in that area. As someone with a family member wc bound (though not with us on this trip) I was impressed by the accessibility for those with disabilities to most all areas of the park. The valley has many streams, runs with a river, trail to the three falls. We hiked several trails all beautiful. But the highest trail takes you to the top of the falls (also the highest elevation climb and difficulty level per the park signs) scary but breathtaking. The bus system is quick and brings you all over tha park. Many places to eat. There's also a huge store in the valley with camping gear, groceries, clothing etc for anything you could need.

Yosemite Valley,"One of my favorite place! Actually my top 2 favorite place in California! I will recommend to visit on Winter and Spring!Winter is like a magic land that you can see in the movies. The snow here is like the softest I have ever touched. You can just lay down and get chill. It was snowing in that time so it feels very quite and peaceful. The road is a little dangerous that they will require people to have requiring 4x4 car or chains.Spring! Oh my gosh it is just gorgeous in spring. You have to hike to see the beautiful scenery and view. It is still a little cold but if you hike then you gonna get sweat! The falls are just stunning and beautiful! If you lucky you going to see the 2 falls in Yosemite. They said since the snow is melting thats when you will see the magic. Bridalveil Fall is gorgeous as well and easy to hike. If you have time, spend 2 or more nights here. Camping is a good idea. I saw a lot of people doing camping and they said the stars at night is just beautiful too. (that's in bucket list as well)From Tracy/Mountain House, CA to Yosemite there's two route that you can take 120 Freeway or 140 Freeway I prefer the 140 Freeway but its another 20 more miles but you will hear the river flows when you are driving and its just peaceful (you might fall asleep). Although the 120 freeway has a stunning view it is a winding road.Overall Yosemite is a must! if you live in California take advantage of it.

Yosemite Valley,"I was a little leary of visiting yosemite in February and thought we'd have the place to ourselves, but it was packed and I can't even imagine it being 1/2 as beautiful in the summer. However, a couple things that I hope can be helpful to someone...the park had flurries all day, so I guess with the prediction of snow showers they were at R1, which requires you to carry snow chains unless you are over 6000 pounds and have all weather snow tires. After deciding we had proper tires and under 6000 pounds we paid to enter. Then, a mile into the park a sham artist is trying to sell chains for $96 and is telling us it's against the law for us not to carry chains in our vehicle. We proceed to tell him it clearly says that they are only required to carry UNLESS you are over 6000 pounds or don't have snow tires, and he got extremely defensive , raised his voice, and told us not to tell him the law and that we would be breaking the law. Thank goodness, we didn't buy them and listen to the con-artist selling snow chains inside the park. We did have flurries all 6 hours in the park. The snow plows were plowing the gravel on the road as there was no snow to plow. I highly recommend Yosemite, even if it's R1, but I can't speak to worse except to buy chains before getting ripped off by the con-artist in the park. As we were exiting the park, it was heavier snow, higher elevation and became R2, and then the snow chains were only $68 in the presence of the park ranger-but he could of also been a different vender-we didn't see the vender as we just decided to exit the park via the low, less snowy road. Just seemed sketch, and then not as sketch when the ranger was present. Get the restrictions ahead of time, if possible, and be educated as to if you need chains or not, and purchase them in town ahead of time.","February 25, 2018",Yes to Yosemite in February!,20,"Barcelona, Spain",5

Many of the hikes have safe routes to lead you to the specific attractions but many people disregard the safe routes. As they ignore the ""Danger. You can die past this point"" signs, they attempt to get closer to one of the many waterfalls. I was one of these people and luckily I made it down safe. I do warn that it is treacherous and serious injury or death can occur whether or not you use caution. My plan for when I return is to finish the upper Yosemite falls hike.

Yosemite Valley,"With a few exceptions, the glory of the valley and the stunning experience that is Yosemite, is poorly delivered to the public via the parks concessionaire. They were more concerned about their employees comfort than the comfort of the their guests. We spent four days in the valley and we were amazed at the lack of hospitality. Restaurants were closed and the ones opened were reminiscent of a school cafeteria. For example, the main restaurant at the lodge did not have water. Instead they gave us a paper cup and told us to fill it up, using the fountain by the bathrooms in the lobby. Temperatures were cold and yet generally they would not build a fire in the fireplaces. The only feed back we got was that kindling was expensive and the wood was frozen. However there was a decorative fire at the deli and ice skating rink. The Awahnee had a deceit fire with a place to seat and enjoy the ambiance. They missed an opportunity to offer warmth and hospitality to the guest by lighting a fire in the game room and ice skating rink in Curry Village. Also at Degnan Deli their larger fireplace remained unused. Only the concessionaire’s convenience was taken into account when they required skaters to walk from the rink to the front desk at Curry Village to buy skating tickets. Then later, when you want the hot cocoa at the warming hut, you have to walk back to the front desk, approximately between 200-300 yards. This sounds petty but we have been coming to this park at the same time each year for 20+ years. This has been the poorest level of service we have experience in this time.

Yosemite Valley,One of the most outstanding places I've ever visited.If you're touring the West Coast make sure you spend some time in Yosemite and if you've only got one day - make it a long one.There's so much walking to do to see all of the sights you need to get here early (just to miss the traffic) and plan to be here all day and into the evening.The views are sensational from the valley floor and once you get into the centre you'll want to be climbing up into the mountains to get some of the spectacular waterfall views. Each of these climbs is 3-4 hours so choose carefully. If you fancy staying on the flat then its easy to see lower Yosemite falls and walk all around Mirror Lake.However:The Park is poorly organised - there's a shuttle bus to get around on but we ended up walking everywhere as the bus was always full. Signs said the park was full all weekend but it wasn't. We didn't see any of the Park Rangers and there is a lack of good places in the Valley to eat - take your own food as it can be a long way between stops. There are lots of places to refill water bottles though.The tourist map is not very good and doesn't give much of an indication of the elevations on several walks or the distances/time involved - do your research first.In April to June there are spectacular waterfalls but I've also been in August when Yosemite Falls was dry and Mirror Lake was a puddle.We were there at the end of May and saw a Mother bear and her cub on the walk beyond Mirror Lake.Go prepared and have an excellent time.,"January 21, 2018",Amazing Place,12,"Bethersden, United Kingdom",5

Yosemite Valley,"It is a beautiful place. It was my second time in the Yosemite and enjoyed it very much. It is a huge National Park with lots of wilderness, the perfect place for nature lovers. Even in two or three days you will see only a little. The 3-day camping adventure was fantastic and I enjoyed every minutes in the park. In the valley it is often very busy. If you have more time try to escape and to enjoy the longer hikes which are more away from the tourists as we did. There are also many walks in the valley and with the free shuttle service it is easy to go around. The end of September we could still see all waterfalls, that was just wonderful. Not to forget all the viewpoints were you can stop for a few minutes to enjoy the spectacular view. Wear comfortable shoes and clothes which for warm and cold weather condition. It can change quickly. It is a must see if you travel around in California.","December 26, 2017",One of the most gorgeous places,45,Switzerland,5

We spent a few hours here arrived at around 10am left at 4ish, my only regret is that We couldn't spend more time, (I was on a tour ) There was a choice of two trails a beginner type one and a more intense one, we choose the more intense one.... Not gonna lie it was intense ! We hiked a 3 mile walk (there and back) to the top of the waterfall on the way down there was times that were terrifying for me but it's like nothing I have ever done before !! The views were spectacular, You need to make sure you have enough liquids and snacks for your walk, us girls are fit 27-31 year olds and had to stopA few times to catch our breath... plus I mean your in California it's not exactly cold. There is a little shuttle bus that transports you around the park, and you can get off at lots of different stops, there is places to buy gifts and places to eat, it's such a huge place you could easily spend two days here, I only touched on some of the park but as mentioned was on a time constraint, Defiantly a tick bucket list, a beautiful place to get back to nature so glad I've seen it with my own eyes.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is awe inspiring, unique, beautiful, spectacular – yes, I was impressed. There cannot be many places on this planet as gorgeous, from a pure scenery perspective, as this valley. Although the national park is huge, the valley itself is relatively compact and fairly easy to see in a few hours if you want the quick version. Private cars are still allowed her so you can drive it yourself, although open-seating buses (really a truck pulling a wagon with about 30 seats) will take you around for a narrated, guided tour. We opted not to do this, visiting in mid-October, partly because it was already getting cool but mostly due to the smoke in the air due to many fires burning in Northern California. Even this late in the season the valley is crowded, and we sat in lines of cars, hardly moving, for over 30 minutes twice. The situation was not helped by road construction, but hotel staff told us it is always this congested; worse at the height of the season. Despite the crowds and the congestion, this place is a must-see experience. Take LOTS of pictures. Another reviewer commented that no matter how many pictures you take, you will wish you had taken more – and I agree. I regret not being able to get to see the view from Glacier Point which overlooks the valley – during our visit the visibility was very poor due to the smoke. I intend to go back soon and fill this square.","October 31, 2017",Awe-Inspiring,279,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",5

Yosemite Valley,"We drove from Sonora and entered at Big Oak Flat Road gate. The ride from Sonora to the gate was beautiful and very windy. We took turns driving so we could both enjoy the scenery on the way to the park and inside the park. The driver needs to fully concentrate on the road at all times.Every so often when I was the driver, my guy would exclaim ""look at that!"" I responded that ""I would love to, but really can't"". We drove to the park each morning for three days. We had a plan and a back-up plan for each day's activity. That turned out to be good planning because the day we wanted to hike part of the John Muir Trail to Cathedral Lake, the Tioga Pass was closed due to snow. We went the next day and were rewarded with a gorgeous Alpine lake to sit beside and eat our packed lunch. It is very hard to ""review"" one of the most beautiful places in the United States. To say that we were awed doesn't even begin to express the wonder we felt. I wish that every American could experience this national park.","October 29, 2017",Amazing visit to Yosemite,25,New Jersey,5
Yosemite Valley,"The most amazing place I have ever visited. We took the Amtrak from San Francisco to Merced. There we were met by the YARTS bus to take us to the Yosemite valley lodge. It stops at the towns and other hotels on the way so there are a variety of accomodation choices which we were unaware of when booking.Once in the valley there is a continuous shuttle service to places of interest so you do not need to hire a car. Bicycle hire is also available and a great way to get around. First impressions are the massive vertical cliffs lining the valley filled with meadows, tall trees and creeks on the valley floor. There are many hikes that are well sign posted but unfortunately we didn't plan sufficient time to do them. Instead we did a self guided photographic tour of the easily accessible sites using the shuttle service and free maps. We also took a 4hr guided tour to Glacier point where the moon surface like scenery is spectacular. Hikes can also be done from here to the valley floor below.Animal life was in abundance with numerous birds, squirrels, deer and a wildcat seen. We saw bear sign but no bears which I was hoping to see.I'm already planning my next trip back where I will spend 1 week. The location is popular with locals so I would not recommend staying during US school holidays. Be aware that the weather can change dramatically and the day I left (27 degrees Celsius) there was snow overnight.","October 28, 2017",Stunning landscapes,7,"Canberra, Australia",5

Once you are on the Valley Floor you'll see El Capitan on the main road - follow this road and you go on a one-way loop around the main attractions. There are separate tracks to other famous sights - again these are well sign posted. It gets very busy but there is plenty of parking dotted around - so you'll be able to get the shots you need.At the heart of the Valley Floor there is a lodge and a close by a giftshop and restaurant.

Yosemite Valley,"This is the heart of the park, and you will certainly end driving through and stopping in the valley given the large number of sites to see, from El Capitan to the various falls, to getting something to eat, etc. It is nice and generally scenic, but in some ways it is poorly laid out. Parking is a bit of a hike from the visitor’s center, and generally it seems like things could have just been planned better. However, there are plenty of great things to see in the valley, nice hikes to go on, and some great waterfalls, so it remains on the must see list when you visit the part.","October 26, 2017",The heart of the park; lots of good things to see here,275,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",4

In addition, when we went (September) a couple main park areas were inaccessible due to renovations, and road work made getting into the valley and visitor center arduous. It's worth spending a day or two there, but we felt our time was much better spent at Sequoia/Kings Canyon, and, in driving across the top of Yosemite to the Tioga Pass.","October 25, 2017",A Victim of Its Popularity,41,"Lancaster, PA",3
Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite was amazing. It was like being somewhere surreal. The scenery and views were amazing . We stayed at tenaya lodge and found out how lucky we were to get booked as accommodation does get snapped up early here. If you don't mind tents then leave planning your trip until last minute but I like my comforts. Yosemite isn't supposed be the height of luxury but instead, getting back to nature and enjoying what the greater source created. The lakes and mountains really took my breath away. The hotel was very nice and had everything we needed. The food was good and the wine was divine. If you're up in San Francisco then Yosemite is well worth the visit. We stayed three nights which was enough but you could easily stay a week. It's great if you want to drive around with maps and do your own tour or if you wAnt planned organised routes with guides. It's a real outdoor retreat for walkers and hikers. Campers and climbers. Great for families and couples and groups. You can also hire cycles to ride around on and there's a train to take you to and from and around the village which hosts a convenience store. There is also a petrol station in the village. Everywhere I've visited in California has been different for all sorts of reasons and this place shouldn't be missed. If you are planning somewhere else afterwards then I recommend a trip to napa or Lake Tahoe.","October 24, 2017",Breathtaking,25,,5

Shuttle buses are free inside the park, ask for a shuttle map which is much better than the map they give you when you go in to the park.We visited the Bridal veil Falls, only a short easy walk, not much water at this time of the year. Also visited Lower Yosemite Falls, again not so much water but certainly a site to see. Lastly we walked up to Mirror Lake and came back down the Valley Loop route, quite uneven but no people on it and about 3 miles.","October 23, 2017",Great place to visit,34,"Poole, United Kingdom",4

Loses half a star as could do with better signs and maps, I found it hard to work out where to go then which way to go and know how far I could go in the time I had. I didn’t dare go too far for fear of getting lost and/or being left behind! But I did find a quiet spot and 2 deer came really close!Wish we could have stopped at more points higher up but sitting on the right of the bus I did get some good glimpses of more magnificent views as we worked our way down to the valley.

Yosemite Valley,"This was the trip I had put off for several years and feel so blessed I finally got to go.Nothing prepares you for that first glimpse of El Capitan and Half Dome rising from the valley floor. No photo, video, live cam can do it justice. It was a spiritual experience for me. GOD is AWESOME.I've been to many National Parks across the U.S. Nothing compares in scope and stark beauty. Waterfalls were at peak flow in the first week of June. Incredible in beauty and raw power. They thunder down the mountains and cool a wide area around the falls. Melting snow pack.The main trails are well maintained and marked. There are dangers, this is the wilderness, but for the most part hazards are identified. Visitors are warned with graphic visuals and signs about deaths that have occurred when rules and restrictions are violated by the public. Some of the Rangers are very rude, especially when you are driving cautiously to avoid hitting pedestrians who might dart out in front of you. They want you to hurry past walkways to keep traffic moving because children are going to obey their hand signals. Since when?A blade of grass is precious to the Rangers, but the feelings of a little elderly woman will be visciously and publically stepped on when they stray from a path. Paths that, in the Village, are poorly marked, contradictory and downright confusing. Get to the park at 5:00 a.m. to avoid traffic and find parking. Period. Any later and it's first come, first serve. And you don't have to pay to go in at that hour, so sleep in and you lose out.A great experience, absent the rude, impatient, unprofessional and short tempered park rangers.

Yosemite Valley,"Whilst Yosemite was always on the California Trip list none of the photographs could prepare us for the sheer scale, beauty and quiet of Yosemite Valley. Whether you look at Half Dome, El Capitan or Mirror Lake you will be totally smitten, your camera won't do the place justice and you'll be lost for words with this wonder of the natural world.What is odd is that despite the number of people in the valley it still retains the sense of being in a church and being surrounded by quiet.We only managed to spend a day and a night here and wish that we could have spent longer (especially as the views change dramatically with the light). We chose to camp in Lower Pines (the smaller of the two camp sites) in a tent and it was perfect for feeling close to nature.Need to know:1. Cost: It costs $30 per car to enter the National Park.2. Bears: You need to keep food in the bear proof containers provided (in camp sites and parking lots) for safety and to avoid a fine.3. Transportation:There is a free shuttle bus that rounds around the valley. So hop on and leave the car behind.4. Accommodation: Make sure that you book well in advance (camp sites and lodges tend to be booked a year in advance by most so be prepared to plan well ahead).Tip: Don't forget to visit the sequoia trees whilst you are in the park. Mariposa Grove is a great favourite (to the south of the park) but this was closed when we were there.

There are several intermediate types of lodging Food is also available from the hotel restaurants, a food court, a pizzeria, fast food place, deli, and a convenience store for those who wish to prepare their own food. There are gift shops in several valley locations and don’t skip the Ansel Adams gallery.

Yosemite Valley,"I live in Alaska so I’m very biased about most places I visit- but Yosemite is definitely a place worth seeing!!!!We brought our kids here for a short 2 day getaway- It is extremely difficult to describe a place that is so massive and leaves you in awe!I’ve seen pictures (lots of pictures) but it doesn’t fully complete the image as does seeing a place in person! I never realized how massive EL Capitan and Half Dome are until today! Can I say WOW!!!I was also impressed from the areas that I saw as to how clean this park is - and how much of the natural habitat is still in place- I do know this is a National Park so there is extra care taken in preserving the natural beauty of the landscape.We’re already planning another trip here so we can spend more time. I would recommend spending the night in some of the accommodations inside the park or camping in the campgrounds inside the park- seeming as it takes a least 1-2 hours to drive into the park (depending on road maintenance projects, thousands of people, winding roads and steep hills etc.)Best $30 I’ve spent in a long time!","October 17, 2017",Make sure to put Yosemite on you Bucket List,8,,5
Yosemite Valley,"We recently spent a day in Yosemite. The highlights are of course, Half Dome from Glacier Point , El Capitan & Yosemite Falls. All are spectacular although managed fires near Glacier Point made vistas unremarkable. The bonus to mid October is the crowds are thinner and except at Yosemite Falls, it di not seem overwhelming. The negative is the waterfalls are at low flow - still wonderful - but not as magnificent. If I were to rate recent National Parks I have visited, I would say there is more diversity of landscape & great animal viewing at Yellowstone & the Grand Tetons (no animal sightings at Yosemite). The distance between the highlights are upwards of an hour through pine forests that are static in landscape. We did not hike here but at elevation, even a walk up to Bridal Falls had us puffing a bit so be prepared. We ate at the Majestic Yosemite Hotel - meal was average but a historic lodge and nice spot for a break. Definitely glad to have visited but do watch the managed fire warning online.

Yosemite Valley,"Loved our recent visit here. Yosemite Valley is more complicated than what you might think at first glance. One of the top 3 most popular national parks in the U.S., naturally there are times and places where you find yourself in a crush of humanity - competing for parking, waiting in a traffic jam, grappling for a spot in one of the restaurants, swarmed by people piling out of a tour bus, etc. Yes, at the Visitors Center or the Village, people are swarming all around. And true, unfortunately, the valley filled with smoke quite frequently this past summer. Consider it an adventure. If you are looking for solitude, you might need to take advantage of one of the many long hikes or rock climbs that are not so easy for most folks to do. My wife and I, being older folks now, are pretty much limited to driving and taking easy mile or two hikes, catching a ride on a shuttle. And yet, somehow, we found ourselves standing in meadows, strolling along riverbanks, admiring waterfalls, studying wonderful rock formations, and enjoying the peaceful aspects of nature. Early in the morning and later in the evening are best; the place can sometimes feel empty. You can hear a bear in the bushes, an owl in a tree, the river flowing over rocks. Concentrate the sight, sound, and feel of natural beauty and you will find it here. And as for the many people that seem to share the place at times, there are many worth meeting from everywhere in the world. It's all good unless you are one of those people who want everything to yourself. In which case, by an island and best of luck to you. Yosemite Valley is great, and it offers something to every one of us who is fortunate to visit.","October 14, 2017","Wonderful Vistas, Diverse Activities",70,"Port Orchard, Washington",5

Yosemite Valley,"Nearing the end of our coach tour which actually finished one day later in San Francisco, we found ourselves at the beautiful Yosemite National park. Our first view was looking down Yosemite Valley towards the ‘Half-Dome’ and ‘El Capitan’, which are the most famous mountains in this area. What a fabulous view, of which we took many photographs; the best of which we had enlarged and printed on canvas when we got back home in the UK. We were here for approx. 5 hours, which gave us plenty of time to see the other famous sight ‘Yosemite Falls’, which is a double water-fall that is extremely high up, in fact we found out that the height from the upper falls to the lower falls is approx. 2,400 feet (732 metres). Now that’s impressive! We walked up to the base of the falls and then around to Yosemite Village which was about a mile or so further on. Museum, gift shops, cafés and of course the much-appreciated rest rooms. The time we had here was comfortable for what we did and what we saw, with of course short rests in between.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is spectacular, there is no denying it. The views are outstanding. We hiked up the Vernal falls trail, which is a reasonably strenuous climb but definitely worth it. Note that the ""easier"" route down is not easier, as the path is eroded and slippery! We also went to Mirror Lake/Meadow, which I'd recommend doing. Happy Isles was stated as a ""must-see"" in our guidebook, however it didn't seem anything too special to us. On the other hand, Yosemite falls are every bit a must-see. However, the traffic is a serious problem. We queued over an hour to leave the park (in October) - the road system is pretty bad and just can't handle the volume of traffic. Just park near the exit and use the shuttle all day (it'd be best if they actually made this compulsory except I guess for campers to be honest). I'd also add that, as a European, Yosemite is spectacular, but we have similar areas in Europe that in my view are every bit as good, if not better (Dolomites, Pyrenees) - from the hype, you might not think this would be the case.

You want to be one with nature but it's hard to do that when there are hundreds of people everywhere and tons of traffic. After going to Banff/Jasper in Canada, we were very disappointed in Yosemite. The views/hikes were nice but the crowds made it hard to enjoy. The public facilities (i.e. bathrooms) were so poorly kept compared to the national parks in Canada.

Yosemite Valley,"Granite is all that exists in the valley and grey is all you see, from light to dark due to spalling of the rock creating a new face, to dark on faces that were never glaciated. Every change in direction of the roads or trails provides new vistas as you are at the bottom of the canyon looking up at the sides. It is also very wide compared to many of the parks with the Merced River cutting downward through the sediment left by the glaciers. There is a variety of wildlife in the park, but bears are the only large fauna and there a few of them. We were able to spot a number of bird species, including 2 young owls, who didn't know better than to perch on a log 3' off the ground, and a buck mule deer who was unimpressed by our presence and just kept browsing. We were also fortunate that last year's snow pack and rains this spring and summer kept Bridal Vail and Yosemite Falls flowing this late. We were able to spend a week in the park and environs and each day was memorable, but even if you only have a day, drive in and take the shuttle around to get a view of its magnificence. Be aware, parking is limited and you may find yourself on the side of the road, far from where you hoped to be. The best bet then is to find a shuttle stop.","September 20, 2017",50 Shades of Grey,169,"Ellington, Connecticut",5

We spent three days here and felt we could have easily filled another week with new walks - we will be back to do more!Make use of the info points and visitor centres, they were invaluable in helping us choose walks that suited us, our fitness level, and our timescales. They can also fill you in on walks that are not available due to the damage from recent forest fires. Glacier point road and Mariposa grove were both closed when we were there this week due to renovations following fires, but we were able to find alternate activities that still had our jaws dropping. I find it odd when people moan about this - fires are part of life in national parks like this and we should be complementing the firefighters who manage to control them, and the staff who work so hard to get back to normal as soon as possible, as well as thanking the visitor centres who help us find alternates when necessary.

The handout says that dogs are allowed on the paths and in one outdoor restaurant, but not in the hotels and shops or the trails. Fine. But we assumed we could get around in the shuttle buses with the dog, but they aren't allowed. We had a very difficult time getting around. Because parking is so hard to find, you want to stay wherever you find a place and then use the shuttles to go all over. We couldn't do that and ended up just leaving.

She advised us to leave at 7.30am and head down which would take about an hours drive from Tenaya Lodge. We headed down and paid the $30 fee to get through to the park which was valid for 7 days.We are glad we headed down so early as it was so busy by the time we arrived. We parked at half dome village which was advised to us and we got one of the past parking spaces.We jumped the free shuttle and done our first hike to Vernals Fall which took about an hour to get to the top it was very steer and slippery so be careful as we saw a few people slip and trip! We also done Mirror Lake and another walk which I believe was on stop 6. The shuttle was great and arrived frequently.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite is a special place. We booked our campsite months ahead of time. My favorite hike is up Vernal falls and Nevada Falls. They have three main parking areas and a shuttle to take you around. As we camped outside the Valley we usual got a parking place in the Valley by 8:30 AM and seemed to get the last ones available. When we were ready to leave there were people waiting for the spots. The shuttles worked well for us. There were wildfires in other parts of the park. Because of that there was a lots smoke in the Valley so ti was her dot see some of the normal sights. The clearest areas were Nevada Falls, Vernal Falls and Mirror lake. The trail to lower Yosemite Falls is easy. There is food and a good store in Yosemite Village. A well as a good visitor center. We got hot showers at Half Dome Village, formerly called Curry Village.

Yosemite Valley,"We went via the south entrance from Fresno. You need to set off early as theres quite a few miles through winding roads once youve paid your $30 entrance fee.You will incline to around 6000 feet with stop off's along the way, take packed lunches and plenty of water. Stop at the Belvedere falls, you can take pushchairs as tarmac path takes you to a viewing area, most of the paths are pretty ok for kids in prams. The visitors centre is extremely busy, rarely anywhere to park, we got there around 1pm, it was choc a block. Anyhow theres a one way system that loops around El Capitain and the falls, the map they provide is pretty basic, youl see signs that are not on the map so if you fancy a good recky get a good map. Take your camera and be sure to stop off at all the viewing points, its well worth it. Your ticket lasts a week too, so if you get chance to go back, also take swim stuff especially for the kids, theres a few lovely places to stop and play in the river, its really slow and low in places this time of year, crisp, crystal clear water as is the air!

The timing was very good before the late summer fires became an issue. Words to the wise, if you want to camp or stay at one of the area lodges, reserve well ahead of time and arrive early. If you are taking a day trip, plan to arrive extra early or the wait to enter the park will be extremely long.

It can be quite overcrowded at the viewing platform at times, but hiking through the valley is a much better way of seeing it anyway! Smoke can be an issue but it's a natural process and in many ways demonstrates how the local ecosystem works- if you are a city-dweller with no knowledge of forest-ecology I guess that could be annoying, but otherwise, suck it up!

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley with its majestic peaks especially the distinctive ""Half Dome"" was formed millions of years ago by a massive glacier which covered North America and when it receeded, it left in place a remarkably tranquil and peaceful valley carved by the Tuolome river. It is so far from the hustling, bustling Silicon Valley of Northern California and yet only a short drive away. Consequently it is a popular destination for San Francisco and the Bay area to re-charge their batteries. Just avoid the peak summer months especially weekends when it is over-crowded.","September 9, 2017",So near and yet so far!,37,"San Francisco, California",5
Yosemite Valley,"As a first time visitor to Yosemite, I didn't know exactly what to expect, especially being familiar with the place so well from photographs. I was worried that in the flesh it might be a let down. However, Yosemite does not disappoint: the place is stunning and rivals any other natural scenery I have ever visited. This despite the fact that I missed many of the famous views, as most of the valley was (completely) enveloped in smoke from nearby wildfires. The place is large: you really need a car to get there and to get around, as the shuttle buses do not go everywhere. It is 50 minutes drive from the valley to Glacier Point, for example, then the same back. Note that not all roads are open all year. Working out the layout of the park and how it operates can also be a bit baffling for the first time visitor: the National Parks Service website is not 100% clear. Also finding a good map is hard (there don't seem to be any maps that come up to Ordnance Survey standard). You need to research hard on the internet to work out what's going on, find a good trail to follow, etc. A lot of people visit. Even in September, during school term, it was packed. It doesn't matter though: the scenery overwhelms any crowd issues. Don't be wary of going to the popular places: they are popular for good reason.We drove to Glacier Point: fantastic view of the smoke! Also walked to the top of Sentinel: easy 20 minutes each way; smokey again. Looked at Bridalveil falls: 5 minutes from carpark, with water even in September. Had food at the Visitor Centre: basic burger but quite tasty and cheap. Got bus to Mirror Lake trail: longer walk, 30 minutes each way, but very scenic spot. Then drove around the valley stopping at the various carparks to take in the classic views. Entry fee is cheap and they do take credit cards. There is no mobile phone coverage anywhere that I could find - so don't rely on google maps for navigation.Only on a day trip from SF: a long drive there and back (on terrible urban highways), but worth every minute. Next time we will take 4 days, if we can find accomodation.","September 9, 2017","Newbie, not disappointed, despite the smoke",18,,5

We drove 7 hours on Labor Day weekend. We noticed that highway 41 was closed due to a fire, thus we drove in via highway 140. The line to get into the park was 4 hours long! Yes 4 hours!!!! The valley was full of smoke from a fire 36 miles away. It took us so long we were there for an hour or so. We went back the next day and we're thrilled that it only took us 2 hours to go in. We had elderly parents and young kids with us and couldn't get there before 10, but we were told that there was no wait at 7 am. Once we got there it was so crowded it was hard to get around.

One of the differences was that last time we went in September when the rivers and waterfalls were thin bands, while this time in May they were roaring. The best way to see the valley is to park your car early in the day (8 or 9am) and leave it there, relying instead on the free valley shuttle system to see the sights. The shuttles run regularly every 15 minutes or so throughout the day picking up and dropping off at all the major attractions (except Bridal Veil Falls). Otherwise, car traffic is literally bumper to bumper from noon to 5 pm throughout the valley. Both movies at the Valley Visitors Center are great, the Ansel Adams Gallery has excellent crafts and posters, and the bookstore has many great titles and souvenirs. Make an advance reservation to have breakfast or lunch at the Majestic Hotel too. It's less-expensive than dinner and a special experience in a gorgeous setting.

There was not a line to get in and parking was not an issue. We hiked the Mist Trail in the afternoon and it was crowded. We opted to come down the John Muir Trail and I would recommend that route as the Mist steps were slippery. Ok to go up but tricky to come down. We also hiked the Yosemite Falls Trail first thing in the morning and there were very few others out. We were able to get lodging in the Park but we did see lots of people lined up for camp sites.

From the Village, the wife & I hiked to Lower Yosemite Falls, continued on the Valley Loop to the Ahwahnee Hotel, returning to the Village. Our children (all 20 years old+ and marathon runners) hiked from Half Dome Village to Mirror Lake to Yosemite Village. This was too easy for them.Later that afternoon they talked mom and dad into joining them for a hike up to Vernal Falls. We agreed to go to the bridge over the Merced that provides a view of Vernal Falls. This was a steep 0.8 mile climb, but mom and dad made it & back in 2 hours. The 2nd day our kids tackled the ""strenuous"" hike up the Upper Yosemite Falls trail and back in 4 hours. The recommended time is 6-8 hours. Gauge your time accordingly.My wife and I rented bikes at the Yosemite Lodge, traversing the outer bike loop in 4 hours. This was a leisure ride that helped us keep loose. This bike route allowed us to take some phenomenal pics.In the evening we took in the Starry Sky's event at the Glacier Point amphitheater. Seeing the stars from 7,200 feet was awesome. At night you could hear the roar of Nevada & Vernal Falls below.On our 3rd day we went to Glacier Point in the morning for a view of the valley below. Stupendous!We followed previous reviews advising to stay hydrated & take plenty of water with you on your hikes. Our kids each had 2.5 liter bladders in their Osprey day packs. My wife & I shared 3 liters of water from our Camelbak. We drank water in the morning before our hikes. We also carried small 1st aid kits, hand sanitizer, disposable ponchos, flashlights, protein bars & the always fortifying PBJ sandwiches.Degnan's Deli in Yosemite Village & the Grille in Half Dome Village provide surprisingly good chow for the hungry hiker/biker.The lines throughout the park were not bad when we were there.Parking was attainable every day. We arrived in the valley anywhere from 830am to 11am.There are air conditioned venues in Half Dome Village, Yosemite Village and Yosemite Lodge if you need to get out of the sun for a bit.

Yosemite Valley,After almost 50 years since I had visited before I was again in awe of the sights and scenery! We visited during what is supposedly the busiest time of the year and found that drastic improvements have been made in traffic and visitor accommodation. No traffic jam horror stories of the past. Do allow enough time to go to Glacier Point. You will be glad you did! There was beauty all about even with the fact of how hazy it was at times because of controlled burning of parts of the forest. Lots of evidence of the fires of years ago that were not controlled burning. Quite interesting to see how the forest is renewing. ,"August 26, 2017",Still An Amazement!,99,"Lebanon, Pennsylvania",5
Yosemite Valley,"We read about this place and absolutely wanted to visit, but once arrived you learn about additional details. To find a good parking spot, you must enter the park before 8 am, to reach the park gate is about an hour drive from Mariposa city. $30 USD for 7 day pass to enter. The park offers a vast area for hikes, rock climbing and picnics with amazing scenic views. The roads are narrow and curry, so driving is not as fast to get to one end to another when you initially time it. Tourist areas are the valley and glacier point. The northern part of the sierra is less crowded and more locals go to avoid the busy rush season. All in all, great place to camp and stay to disconnect from the world.

Yosemite Valley,We drove from San Fran. It was a good 3 and a half hours drive. We set off early but approaching the park there were traffic bottlenecks in some areas. Before we got to the valley we stopped at many beautiful spots to take photos.Entrance is $30 At the valley you can park your car at the many car parks then take the various shuttles that go around the park. Finding a parking space took a while as it was so busyMany of the falls and Half Dome are within the valley. Some can be accessed with the shuttle. Shuttles were easy to use but really full. A few times we had to wait for the next bus. Some of the drivers were brilliant but we had one awful one. We asked him to tell us where to get off for Half Dome and all he gave us was sarcasm.If you have only one day here suggest coming to the valley and exploring from there.

Yosemite Valley,I can't believe these most recent reviews don't mention how terrible the visibility has been. We were there last week and barely saw half dome. Plus it was crazy crowded. My husband and son started the hike up to Vernal Falls but turned around because there were too many people. We stayed overnight and I will agree that early morning and evening were quite nice - the crowds were gone and the air cleared up in the evening. Oh - also the traffic signage is bad too. It was always unclear exactly what the signs were telling you to do - and sometimes they were completely missing. We had to go back and forth between Valley Lodge and Curry Village several times and I kept ending up in the wrong place!! I finally figured out I was making a wrong turn at in unlabeled intersection. We have been there before so we knew what to expect as far as views go - and it was disappointing.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is the main visitor site for Yosemite national park. There are numerous places to park in the valley, the visitor centre has the most parking places. Be aware that the car park fills up by 9/10am, we arrived at 11am the first day and got stuck in a lot of traffic with no where to park. If you don't find a space in the visitor centre try to park near to one of the shuttle stops. Don't give up your parking space to move around the park as you are unlikely to find another space after 10am, use the shuttle buses instead. The shuttle buses are excellent and take you around all the major sites in the valley. Be aware that these buses also become very busy and towards the end of the day you could be waiting up to an hour to get on the bus! One piece of advice I had before we went was to spend at least 3 nights here! We couldn't stay in he park itself as it gets booked way in advance so we stayed in Mariposa. It's too far to drive for a day trip from LA or San Fran, and once you arrive you won't want to leave so stay here at least one night! Despite the traffic and fight for parking once you get off the main tourist lookouts in Yosemite you can be completely alone, and it is such a spectacular place, one of the best places I have visited in the world. Enjoy! ","August 21, 2017",Such a beautiful place!,186,birmingham,5
Yosemite Valley,"The valley and its views are incomparable. We got here by 10am and by prayer got a rare parking space in spite of the crowds. We left our car parked and took the bus around the immediate area. The visitor center is worth it. The valley could not be clearly seen as there was a large fire in the area. This was worth the hassle, it is a great national park.","August 20, 2017",Great scenery worth the crowds,191,"Manalapan, New Jersey",5
Yosemite Valley,"Only visited for a day and didn't stay in the Valley. We came in via Tioga pass and it's a very long, very twisty road down - a couple of excellent pull-over points though. Scenery is stunning with the mountains just towering above - well worth the walk up to the lower waterfall if nothing else. Great views of the meadows, half dome and other features from the valley floor and regular free shuttles can transport to the main sights.Parking can be a challenge and is poorly organised with limited signing; basically everyone for themselves! Don't be tempted to park outside of set areas - the tow trucks were aplenty! The visitor center is very small considering the number of people visiting and has limited self-serve information without queuing up to speak to someone. It also badly needs a coffee shop or other refreshment center - can't believe they haven't taken advantage of the captive audience here! Staff are very helpful if anyone in your party has accessibility issues and can recommend routes to use.Number one tip is just to set-off early, get there and parked and enjoy the incredible scenery whilst everyone else queues to get in and frantically seeks a space.","August 20, 2017",Stunning views - very busy - limited facilities,13,"Whiteley, United Kingdom",5

Yes it is busy in the summer but we did not see any of the reported 2 to 3 hour traffic jams. The shuttle buses are brilliant with their friendly, chatty drivers.

We recently drove over to see the Valley and it was amazing with all the waterfalls flowing. Yosemite is always beautiful but this year it showed off. Some things to remember. Yosemite is very crowded as well as beautiful. Cars and crowds dominate the Valley in the summer and especially on the weekends. If you can come in the spring or fall, you will be able to stop and get some pictures without Tom, Dick and Harry in it. Excuse me but I may have just dated myself. lol. Try to take some of the hikes to see the waterfalls. For the first time ever, I hiked to the bridge to see Vernal Falls. Oh My, it is an upward climb but not awful. Take Water! Another thing to remember. Walk all the way across the bridge for the best view of the waterfall. We noticed many people stopping at the beginning of the bridge, take a few pictures then leave. What a shame for them and we did tell a lot people, keep walking. They were quite happy to see the difference in the view of the Falls by going several steps further.

The place is crowded though and the campsites are extremely close together but we did have a great time. Most campsites are near the river so bring a raft or tube or something to float on. Bicycles are a must to get around because of all the traffic and the crowded infrequent buses. Most sights are accessible by bicycle and a short hike as are the stores, restaurants and the showers. The store prices are not bad so if you forget something it is an option to pick up what you need and the restaurants are just a few dollars more than usual. Bears, Bears and more Bears, everything revolves around keeping the bears away. The lockers for food are small but fit a couple small ice chests and are located in each campsite. Trash must be disposed of frequently so bring bags. And the 5 - 10pm campfire rule is strictly enforced so have an alternative means of cooking.

Because we were here of a weekend the valley floor gets very busy, so we got up early and visited half dome village. From here we walked to mirror lake.

There were roads closed, parking areas jammed, traffic jams and more. We spent most of the time in the car just waiting. If your car brake down... oboy!2.

It was about 4 hours for driving, relaxing and taking pictures.","August 9, 2017",Bummer,115,"Pinehurst, Texas",3
Yosemite Valley,"Visiting the Yosemite National Park Valley is a must for anyone travelling though this beautiful part of California. A lovely view of the whole valley can be seen from Glacier Point 3000ft above. The valley itself holds several treasures all beautiful in their own right. We visited Bridal Veil Fall, Yosemite Falls, Cathedral Bridge, Mirror Lake, the Lodge, Tunnel View. Many fantastic views of El Cap and Half Dome. A karate number of longer hikes are available but as we only had one day we tackled the easy ones only and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.","August 9, 2017",Magnificent scenery,109,"Perth, Australia",5
Yosemite Valley,Yosemite is filled with so many amazing wonders. The Valley is the hub and jumping off point for discovering many of them so it is often very crowded.

Yosemite Valley,"So much to see and do. You don't have to be a hiker to enjoy it. They offer shuttles and guided tours. I recommend seeing EVERY point of interest as each area is unique and beautiful. The golf course in Wawona is horrid but cheap (we call it the ""goat ranch"". If you are a picky golfer don't go; if you want cheap family fun, bring about 50 golf balls because you will lose at least half. Mariposa Grove (Giant Sequoias) is closed until 2018 - they are redoing the roads and walkways to reduce man's impact on the trees.

The views are breathtaking, you can't believe you're here to see it in person. There are a lot of people in the valley, and you want to get in before 9 if you want parking, but in spite of all the people we were able to find trails and adventures to take us out away from the masses.

Yosemite Valley,"This was our second visit to the valley (first time was in the fall years ago - NOTE: very little water over the falls anywhere in the valley in the fall - so we returned in the spring, after/during the snow melt). The waterfalls were spectacular. Hiking was exhilarating, though a little strenuous, depending on the routes you pick. Temps. were cool. Note: of the four routes into the valley, the route from the east is closed from late Sept. until early June (snow), the northern route on the west side also closes often due to snowfalls, the central route on the west side is under construction, as is the southern route on the west side - so leave lots of extra time to get into the valley. Stay at one of the accommodations in the valley to save on the drive in and out, but be prepared to pay a steep price (the lodges in the valley are pricing themselves out of range for the quality and service they provide - book early as all accommodations fill up early).","August 7, 2017","WONDERFUL PLACE FOR OUTDOOR ACTIVITY, BUT GETTING TOO PRICEY",202,"Whitby, Canada",5

Yosemite Valley,"Had a great 2 days in Yosemite! Took 2 different tours - first day was a private customized tour where we hiked up a mountain side to the top of a waterfall. The hike was a bit strenuous, but we knew this going in. The second day was the bike + hike tour where we got to see different areas in and around the valley floor. Both tours were excellent and while very reasonable in price, are worth every penny. For the customized tour, they will ask if you prefer something easy, medium or difficult. It was nice because we got to speak to our customized tour guide, Alex, and told him we'd be doing the bike + hike the next day - so he suggested hikes that differed so we wouldn't see the same thing twice. There is so much to do in the park. You could easily spend a week there and have every day filled. Get there early for ease of parking. If you don't want to venture in for parking, the YARTS is a great way to enter without the hassle of driving. Plan for long days - have fun!","August 6, 2017",Stunning views,5,"Miami, Florida",5

The view of the Yosemite Valley when you exit the tunnel is so amazing. We stayed in Wawana which is a 30 minute drive from the valley. There are actually some great places to hike there also.Though you can see a lot of the scenery by driving to several of the overlooks, I would recommend hiking at least one of the trails if you are able. Be very aware of the intensity level of the trail as well as your fitness level. One of the trails that we enjoyed the most was the Inspiration Point Trail. This was a moderately strenuous hike, but we were rewarded with a fantastic view of the Yosemite Valley.The only downside to the visit was the traffic. This was worse down in the valley. Though there are a few very crowded trails, many of the more strenuous trails had very few people. Definitely put Yosemite on your bucket list.

Yosemite Valley,"Last fall (in San Luis Obispo - a super place to visit) I was served by a bartender who grew up in Yosemite (his dad was a park ranger). I had never been to Yosemite, so I asked when I should go. He said, ""The spring when the waterfalls are flowing.""What neither one of us knew at that time was that California was about to be hit with EPIC winter snows....leading to a spring snow melt....leading to waterfalls the likes you may never see in your lifetime.I drove through Yosemite on a cross-country trip and saw about a dozen waterfalls...not just trickles...but WATERFALLS! One was a waterfall seeming to burst from a mountainside forest.I can honestly tell you that I had never been to Yosemite...and I may never go again...because I saw it on a day with a glorious blue sky...green trees...and water gushing from everywhere you could look....you practically had to pinch yourself to believe it was all real.Yes, it cost $30 to see this splendor and Yes...it was WICKED CROWDED (it took nearly an hour to get into the Park by 10a)...but I am SO HAPPY I had the privilege to see this most glorious and spectacular display of nature. I'll bet you can guess that my advice would be to take the advice of the guy who grew up in Yosemite...and if you have a choice to plan your trip... go in the spring and see the waterfalls.","August 4, 2017",VISIT IN THE SPRING!,26,Guadalajara,5

However, it was SO busy that we weren't even able to do and see everything we would have liked to. All parking lots were full to the point that people were just parking all willy-nilly anywhere there was a bit of space which made it super hard to navigate through some areas. And a lot of the drivers were in such a hurry, which doesn't make sense to me because the whole point is to sightsee!

The administration of this park has to do something, may be issuing some sort of passes that you MUST buy in advance and limit the number of visitors per day. We were 4 women and the restrooms were simply DISGUSTING, impossible even to get into them. After doing 6000 miles in the US this was the ONLY place where we found such a situation. Perhaps it's time for people to pay to use restrooms. I cannot imagine people traveling with kids or elders.

Yosemite Valley,"1st time. Family vacation- Parents, grandparents, teens, young kids, Yosemite Valley is absolutely breathtaking! Surprises: Everything is awe inspiring! There are a lot of people in a small valley. It was hot! 3 days was just about right to see everything in the Valley. What we did- Yosemite Falls, amazing and loud! Mist Trail- broke a sweat and then got drenched, was a little nervous with my kids last part of trail cut into rock. Glacier Point- worth it. 4 mile trail- only walked down, made the mistake of going after lunch, steep and hot!! Mirror Lake-meh. We live in Rocky Mountains so this was just okay. (Great view of Half Dome though.) Bridal Veil and Tunnel View were perfect little side stops in afternoon when we were worn out. Tuolomne Grove (Mariposa was closed)-pretty, quiet/peaceful, long walk to trees. Tip: Try and visit sites from 9a-12p, take a lunch break, go back out at 3p to avoid long lines and bulk of crowd.

Wildfires in the surrounding areas caused a lot of smoke to obstruct the many natural splendors of Yosemite. We travelled hundreds of miles only to be disappointed since we only got a small glimpse/tease of what is there to see! From talking to others it seems that wildfires and smoke are a natural occurrence every year...so save yourself the disappointment and research this. Not to mention that if you have respiratory issues, this wouldn't be the time to go. Cause it's really thick in some areas.

Yosemite Valley,"There are lots of walks off to some of the falls and up and beyond, but for those wanting a gentler walk, the valley floor offers several options for a gentle stroll with breathtaking views. The valley is broader than Zion and is wide enough to provide for a wider range of great photo opportunities. It is stunningly beautiful.We walked a nice circle across the meadows crossing the river at both the Sentinel and Swing bridges. This gave lovely views both up and down the valley and across both sides. It is all pretty awe inspiring but my strongest impression was being on the South side of the valley and looking across to the water cascading down the Yosemite falls, and, in particular, hearing the thumping sound as the water crashed down onto the rocks. Yosemite can get very crowded but people seem to focus their attention on the walks to the falls and more elevated viewpoints, yet across the meadows you can find places where you can barely see a soul.

When you finally get to the bottom of the valley you first see the water fall which is a short walk, but lots of rocks if you want to get closer to the fall. There is so much to see in the valley and really good to take your bikes to ride. There is bus shuttles. If you wake up early you can see deer walking around. It is a Hidden gem.

During July it is very busy and I don't understand how the hours one some things end so early for so many people filling up the park, especially the purple line valley floor shuttle that services the folks who have to park further away. A member of our party had to walk about a mile and a half as it started to get darker in the road basically with three kids when the folks who parked closer and therefore could get to cars easier that shuttle ran longer. The Valley floor is excellent tourist attraction as is rest of the park, but some of the services seemed lacking like that one for a major park during a peak time of year. Overall else is very good in terms of hikes and things to see and do. Also had surprisingly great cell service which helped meet up with people in the park which is almost impossible in others like Yellowstone or Glacier for example.

We were there for two days; it's not enough.

About a third of the way up, there is a pull off with bathrooms. After getting out and walking around, I felt much better the rest of the trip to the valley. The roads were built by the Corp of Army Engineers, so they are banked well, which helps. WATERFALLS: The waterfalls were running like crazy due to the ton of snow this winter. This hasn't happened in a while like this! PARKING= Drive around the loop so you are heading back and there is quite often parking in the area just by the falls trails. Human nature is we grab the first available spot as we enter the valley. That may involve a bit of a hike to the village, falls, shuttles, etc. Even if you take the loop and there isn't any parking, there is a cross over just down the road a ways where you can head back to the valley and try again. Once you are parked you can walk, or take the FREE park shuttle to different locals. The visitor center has movies about the area and the usual museum and gift shop. Do take the HIKE to the base of the falls. It is an easy walk, and well worth the effort. There is a more strenuous trail to the top of the falls. FOOD: The deli is closed for remodeling, so the hamburger stop is about it. The food was pretty decent and not overly priced for a tourist area. The line moved fairly fast.

The Shuttle buses are great but can get crowded, we ended up walking around the valley floor. All of what we saw at Yosemite was just beautiful. From Vernal Falls(take water proofs), Nevada Falls, Yosemite Falls Sentimental Dome, Taff Point, Glacier Point, Mist Trail, The Giant Sequoias, The John Muir Trail, El Capitan and Half Dome it's nature, it's beautiful and it's all assessable. If your hiking be prepared. Do your research on the trails you think sound your thing. Take water, sun screen and food, good hiking shoes and a map will help you enjoy it more than just turning up in the middle of the day when everyone on the tour buses turns up. Where's wilderness hikes and so much more than just the valley floor. Take binoculars and a camera, the camera goes without saying but it's great fun standing on Taff point trying to spot the climbers going up El Capitan! Pure beauty on so many levels that has to be seen once in your life! ","July 21, 2017",Jaw Dropping Beauty! ,43,"Brighton, United Kingdom",5

Yosemite Valley,"This was so hard to rate. The scenery in Yosemite Valley was unbelievably stunning. The park itself is gorgeous with waterfalls, lakes, trails, El Capitan, Half dome and we even saw wildlife. The rangers we talked to were very nice, friendly and informative.Unfortunately, the traffic is horrendous! we ere gridlocked most of the first day after arriving at 10:00 am and not being able to find a parking spot until after 5:00. We stayed at a resort in the park, but they do not have designated parking. We wasted a whole day just stuck in the car. The National Park service should sort out a system. There should be reserved spots for the hotels and limited entrance for cars. Put signs outside the park to say when the parking is full. Then visitors could take the shuttles and the YARTS shuttles could operate much better and more efficiently.","July 20, 2017","Stunning Views, Terrible Traffic",64,"Atlanta, Georgia",4

Yosemite Valley,"The valley is gorgeous, but arrive very early if you need parking. I highly recommend taking YART in, if you can (book early). However, the bus system leaves a lot to be desired.

Yosemite Valley,"To quote John Muir, ""It is by far the grandest of all the special temples of Nature I was ever permitted to enter."" Photos I have seen in no way capture the majesty of Yosemite. One day is not enough to fully enjoy all the trails, views and environments, and nothing prepares you for your first 'real' view when you exit the tunnel into the park - I still catch my breath when I think of it. There is a $30 entrance fee, however, if you have a senior pass the cost is free for the holder of the pass and the occupants of one vehicle. There are also military passes which are free for an annual pass. Annual and senior passes can be obtained for a fee (worth the price every time) from the US Geological Service online (usgs.gov/pass) and are sent by mail with a hangtag for your auto, or sites where the passes are accepted. Allow for 2-3 months for your pass to arrive, as they are very popular. (You must also be an American citizen to obtain one.) There are three major lots for parking, and try to arrive early because they fill up - afternoons and weekends are especially busy. There is also free shuttle service to various stops throughout Yosemite valley. Back to Yosemite: the waterfalls are truly beautiful, but do have sturdy footwear and a rain poncho, especially for Bridal Veil Falls. Do pay attention to the descriptions of the hikes - they are accurate! The short hike for Mirror Lake is easy, however the full loop may best be described as moderate - to - difficult in a few spots that are rocky and uneven. That being said, if you are physically able, do try. I have never seen anything so beautiful, anywhere, ever. There are so many places here where you want to capture the moment forever, and can take hundreds of photos to try. If you're lucky enough to stay overnight, take this hike early. We stayed at the Half Dome Village in a tent with two double beds, shelving, a safe and bedsheets, blankets and pillows provided. In spite of that, even in June, it is cold at night. The door to the tent closes, and there is an electric light. There are also two building with showers convenient to the tents, and you must use a code that is given to you upon registration for entry, thereby providing a degree of safety. Also, there are bears and there have been bear break-ins in vehicles, and it is not pretty, so each tent cabin is provided with a bear locker that latches shut. Keep Nothing in your tent or cars - they have an acute sense of smell and you will be fined up to $5000.00. So not worth it. In the Half Dome Village area there is a Meadow Grill for dining, a pizza deck, a Dining Pavilion and an Ice Cream and Coffee Corner. The ""milk shake"" at the Meadow Grill is really a thick soft-serve (don't know about the ice cream shop). There is also a gift and mountain shop in the same location. The maps given to you upon entry to the park are clear and easy to follow. There are also some lovely shops and exhibits near the main visitor's center.","July 19, 2017",Not enough superlatives!,48,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",5

Yosemite Valley,"I don't like to write average reviews, but we were not able to take away many high points from our trip. So let me explain, we did not arrive early and we did not find a parking space in the valley as we were urged to do. We circled the valley 3 times taking pictures as we could and opting for picnic areas to use the restroom and view what little nature we could. The traffic is really bad near the visitors center and to add insult to injury the Northside Rd of the loop is under repairs with up to a 30 minute wait for construction workers to dump asphalt. To escape the madness we took the road up to Bridal Veil Falls and Tunnel View and went out the back exit to get back to our hotel.","July 18, 2017",Yosemite a Beautiful Pain in the A..,64,"Houston, Texas",3

Yosemite Valley,"This was our second trip to the Park. First was in the middle of Sept. with fewer crowds and much less water, but still breathtaking. The snow melt in May had the Falls erupting ! The best way to tour the Park is to arrive early, 7 to 8 AM, park at Half Dome Village and spend the day. It is important to get IN early. Glacier Point and other spots are easy to get to on your way out. We stay at Yosemite View Lodge. It is the closest hotel to the El Portal entrance and a great place. Bring rain gear or quick dry clothes if you plan on hiking the Mist Trail, it's more than a mist in May. If you travel later in the season and want to hike Half Dome, you must get a permit in advance. Yosemite Mountaineering School has guided hikes that include the permit and are well worth the price.

Yosemite Valley,"I try to come to Yosemite every year and I enjoyed it in the middle of July even though it is overcrowded. I usually come in spring or fall when the kids are still in school but I came this year in July because of the high water. The terrific Sierra winter filled all the waterfalls even at this late date and Happy Isles was running high, cold and deep. Most parts of the valley are accessible to non-hikers, wheelchairs, small kids (although parents must keep the kids away from the dangers). Tioga Road was open so we could use it on the way back to Reno. The high country was just waking up from the long winter, snow still present in places and Tuolumne services were still closed (July 15). Nevertheless, many people were enjoying the high country. Traffic in the valley can be a nightmare with an hour wait at the 120 entrance station (on a Saturday). But, whatever the mild frustrations with traffic, food service, shuttles being full, you are overwhelmed by the surroundings, the views, the ability to avoid the crowds by walking just a few hundred yards into a meadow or up a trail. Get there early or you can't park. You must reserve lodging or camping months in advance. You can spend days here and not see even the whole valley, not to mention the high country hikes.","July 16, 2017",Superlative place in the Range of Light,8,"Reno, Nevada",5

Yosemite Valley,"We visited Yosemite Valley end February. We were lucky to have beautiful sunny weather. Getting there had been hard though, with two entry routes namely through Fish Camp and Buck Meadows closed. The valley is very nice with mirror lake, all the waterfalls and much more. Even with so many entries closed and being a weekday in February, it was crowded. Guess it must be winderness-disneyland in summer. We also did a hike outside the Valley where we were basically alone to admire all nature greatness. One thing really annoying is the tire chains issue. You need to carry with you tite chains in winter but with rental cars this is a problem. They do not hire them, we tried several car rental companies. So we had to buy them which was also easier said then done, as most shops run out (end winter). In the end, we found one last pair at O' Reilley's for about 90 dollar. Never had to use them so in the end just had to leave them behind. I do understand that chains could suddenly be needed and that you need them, but please work with local companies or put on the website where people can rent them. This is really very annoying for visitors with rental cars and a total waste! ","July 14, 2017",Breath-taking but do not only visit the Valley and i hate tire chains,46,,4

Even if you are relatively old and slow like me, this is well worth the driving, riding and/or walking to see. The sites are breathtaking.The NPS does an admirable job of keeping the traffic under control and have a well developed free shuttle system throughout the park. Additionally, there is a regional bus system, so if you don't have to drive into the park, then don't do it. There are a large range of options for spending time in the park from full service hotels to primitive camping.

Yosemite Valley,We visited Yosemite for the first time. It was a sort of family reunion to celebrate my in-law's 60th anniversary. We stayed in a VRBO rented house in Mariposa. We all loved it! Water falls are at a record high due to the heavy rains we had earlier this year. My mother-in-law is in a wheelchair and was able to see a lot. We went all over the park. The shuttles accommodate persons in wheelchairs and there's a lot of paved walks. The park rangers are very courteous and helpful. Even though it was 106 F the first day we still loved it!We're definitely going again. ,"July 13, 2017",Fabulous even when hot,2,,5

Yosemite Valley,"We loved our visit to the Yosemite Valley! Since we only had one day, we wanted to make the most of it. Thanks to our AirBnB host's tips, we abided by the ""Gate by 8"" rule. Basically, if you get to the Yosemite entrance gate by 8am, you should have no problems with parking! Once in the park, we suggest heading straight to Tunnel View, coming back down to stop at Bridalveil Falls, and then park your car! Again, we did this and had no problems parking. From there, park the car and hop a shuttle bus over to Vernal Falls on the Mist Trail. We started around 9:30am and the trail was already quite busy. We loved it though! Pack a poncho too as the falls are still raging right now.We also made the trek up to Nevada Falls - the crowds really thin out at this point and you feel that you actually are in nature and not a touristy place. At the top of Nevada, take the John Muir trail back down to the Vernal Falls footbridge. Yes, it is longer, but it's a change of scenery and you avoid going down the slippery steps while people are also coming up them. Once we made it back to the shuttle, we had to wait around 30 minutes before we could actually get on because it was so crowded. The plus though is that the hike/shuttle took so long that we avoided the lunch rush at Degnan's and had no trouble finding a place to sit. We also highly recommend going to Glacier Point. Sure, it takes an hour to get there from the Valley, but it is SO worth it! Enjoy Yosemite!! We can't wait to go back and check out some other areas of the park!

Yosemite Valley,"Be prepared for hour long parking spot searches, hoards of people and a really touristy experience... needless to say we arrived around 2 pm and had enormous problems finding a parking spot, so if you plan to go, do arrive early.Approaching the valley there is scarce information about available parking to be found from signs. Neither available parking spots nor even the placement of existing parking lots are announced on signs. We drove around in circles without gps signals and found a spot after 40 minutes by sheer luck. Main form of transportation around the valley is shuttle bus. The system works well and drivers are informative with announcemens about best choices to get to different destination.The valley is crowded, supercrowded. Just be prepared. The walk to the lower falls was nice, the movie about the founder of the park was very American (i.e. he was ofc. the best man that ever lived) but also interesting. On our way out we were delayed by TWO HOURS over the course of a few miles due to road work that forced the long queues to complete >20min standstills several times. We tried to leave around 4-5 pm but did not get out of the park until around 7 pm.

Very frequent, never had to wait for more than 1 bus and the longest wait at a stop was 12 mins. Yosemite at 3pm after walking 7 hours at stop 16 the happy isles had in my guess over 120 people waiting some folk in front of us missed the previous bus and told us they had already waited 30 mins.

Yosemite Valley,"One of the most beautiful places on earth! But there are a few things you should know about the valley. 1: You better get in the valley parking lot before 8:30 am. That way you will get a parking spot. It fills up fast with very impatient tourists. 2: In The hot summer months, people are moving very slow because of the heat, and sorry to say there are lots of very out-of-shape visitors who have a difficult time moving out of the way, so start your bike ride early. There are crowds of people on the paths around the tourist spots. It's been my families experience that they won't move for you even when you say: 'on your left' when trying to pass. They are very preoccupied with the beauty of the park. Soy pay extra attention. 3: Be very careful on the trails. Many are very steep & crowded. They are packed with inexperienced hikers. Many take their small children and don't watch them! In my opinion lots of these parents with young children should go through a short corse given by a ranger on the dangers of steep mountain hikes. (They do have posters & info on people who have recently died on the trail, most people just walk past without looking.) These trails are Extremely steep in parts & some people with large backpacks don't pay attention when they swing around or back up etc. People have actually been knocked off & killed. I hike a lot & I was 'bumped into' many times, I was actually scared. Again, start your hike early! Hope this helps!","July 11, 2017",What you should know,2,,5

Yosemite Valley,"Make sure to wear good sturdy hiking shoes if you want to do any of the trails here. My friends and I only had the day so we did the Mist trail that leads into the John Muir trail. It was absolutely amazing, recommend going up the mist trail then down the John Muir, as you get absolutely drenched at Mist. We went up Mist but encountered people coming down it and with the steps soaked it looked like they were struggling to stay upright at points. When you think you get to the top your not, keeping following the signs to the Nevada falls trails, as some people missed it. There are a couple of small natural waterfalls that act as refreshing cool down showers that were amazing! A huge CON is the free shuttle bus network which does an hour round trip to all the main trails. They are constantly full and honestly going out in the afternoon we got off after 3 stops and even though we were shattered we ended up walking the next 6 stops because of the traffics holding the bus up. We also had a really rude driver, we were crammed in like sardines and a couple of the male standing passengers were built like linebackers which made the very limited space feel smaller but he wouldn't move until there was 8 standing right at the back 4 in the door way and however many in the front standing section. I was plastered between two of the guys, skin to skin and it was hot and sweaty and extremely uncomfortable.

Leo arrived at the designated pick up point ban on time in his shiny squeaky clean SUV and proceeded to give us a detailed background of all the sights etc - we were lucky to see Yosemite in all its glory with waterfalls full and the forests green and we got to see bears, deer, stags apart from chipmunks n squirrels. The hotel room at Yosemite had a balcony with the river at touching distance and the view esp at sunrise was phenomenal.

Yosemite Valley,"We visited Yosemite at the beginning of July. We stayed at Tenaya Lodge (which I will review separately). On their advice, we chose to take a tour with ""Discover Yosemite"" on our first full day. This took us around all the ""must see"" viewing points more efficiently than we would have been able to do by ourselves, particularly as parking was almost impossible as the day progressed. On our second full day, we drove ourselves, arriving at the south entrance of Yosemite shortly after 7:30am ( realising from our experience that an early arrival was essential). By doing this, we were able to get a parking space ( even at that time, there were many places taken) and did our day's walking, having left our car in one spot. There is a free shuttle around the valley, but the demand is huge...be prepared to queue if you want to make use of it. Our 'independent' visit was appropriately on 'Independence Day' & this probably helped in reducing the numbers just a little. We did the walk to Mirror Lake & the loop trail that goes beyond it and back. It was an easy trail, as is mostly flat. The Mirror Lake's effect was most magnificent when viewed from the south eastern side (on the day and time of our visit...it may vary with the position of the sun). The mirror effect is quite striking. As you walk beyond the lake, the path becomes less busy and it was lovely to sit by raging waters, enjoying the amazing sights all around. The time in Yosemite was definitely the highlight of our time in the U S.","July 7, 2017",Spectacular ,15,"Melbourne, Australia",5
Yosemite Valley,"When we entered the park, one of the rangers suggested that we get to the valley before 10 am because there will be no parking by then. Boy was she right. We got there in time to get parking by Sentinel Bridge (shuttle stop 11), but the whole time we were there we saw cars driving around looking for parking. I would try to get parking near a shuttle stop because that makes it easier to get around; there are 20 or so stops throughout the park which make getting around super convenient. Most of the well known attractions are in the valley, so you will probably end up there at some point. It is absolutely gorgeous, just make sure that you get there early so you can find parking.","July 7, 2017",Make sure you head in early,112,"New York City, New York",5
Yosemite Valley,"Everyone else will tell you about the sites. I've watched it change from a few campers to maddening crowds over the last 65 years. Here's a few tips.1. You don't have to camp in the park. There are many places outside the valley you can stay overnight at about the same cost.2. Get there VERY early!! By breakfast time it's a zoo. In addition, many of the really gorgeous sites occur as the sun is coming up.3. There are two free shuttles that takes you to most of the valley floor attractions where you can get on and off for short hikes, the falls, longer hikes, shopping, restaurants, etc.4. Parking fills up quickly - especially on the roads, regular parking lots, visitor's center, and Yosemite lodge. However, check the map and you'll see the hotels, and Curry Camp. These don't fill up quite as quickly.5. If you do park on a road make sure you are OUTSIDE to painted white line. RVs and trucks are wide and may clip your rear end if you let it stick out.6. Take a backpack with plenty of water and snacks. Food at concessions is expensive.7. Prepare to walk quite a bit.8. Take suncreen, a hat and/or an umbrella for shade or rain.9. Don't be in a hurry. Take time to sit and enjoy the splendor of the Yosemite Valley. Let the majesty and serenity of the valley settle into you.10. If you have kids, let them run a little. Give them a chance to enjoy the rocks, trees, and semi-wilderness around them. Just keep them out of the roads! (of course, at bumper-to-bumber and 3 miles per hour, most cars aren't dangerous).Enjoy! {:-)","July 6, 2017",What? No Parking? Try these tips!,68,"Los Angeles, California",5

We hiked and just tried to take it all in. This was an outstanding year to visit because of all the rain and snowfall in California. The waterfalls and rivers were raging.

Be aware of closures due to landslides as well as snow if you travel in late spring/early summer. The park does provide bus travel to 27 different areas. The lines were long. They also have bike rentals in certain areas. There are restaurants or concession areas throughout the park as well as restrooms. Everything was clean and functioning.

Yosemite Valley,"I recently traveled to Yosemite with my wife for a vacation (that she planned). I am deathly afraid of heights. What I mean by this (since everyone has a different perception of heights) is that anything 40+ feet off the ground I become very uncomfortable. Legs freeze up, difficulty moving, fear of falling etc...The drive in to Yosemite was AWFUL in my opinion. I did a lot of reading on this prior to our trip and many reviewers noted ""nothing scary about the roads."" We took 41 in, and it was nothing but winding roads, no guard rails, and 100's to 1000's of feet in elevation. Yes the speed limit is 25 MPH, but you get cars tailgating you and busses/RV's flying in the opposite direction. My wife thankfully did the driving. After some sweating, heavy breathing, and saying ""slow down"" 100x we finally made it into Yosemite Valley...I am really glad I stuck out the car ride because Yosemite Valley is incredible. There are a lot of things someone with a fear of heights can do in Yosemite without issues.1. Bridalveil Valls2. Lower Yosemite Falls3. Mirror Lake / Mirror Lake Trail4. Lots of other small ground level trails within the ValleyI did attempt to do the first half of Vernal Falls (up to the bridge). I was told my our concierge this was ""easy to moderate"" and ""I would not have any problems."" I can tell you that this was far from accurate. The trail is several feet wide, no guard rail, with a steep steady uphill walk. I made it several hundred yards onto the trail and felt extremely uncomfortable, and went back down.I did not attempt any other ""moderate to strenuous hikes."" That being said, I had a blast and there was plenty to do. While I would not go to Yosemite park again, I look at it as a once in a lifetime opportunity, and it was incredibly beautiful.","July 2, 2017",Honest Review for those Scared of Heights!!,13,,5

Yosemite Valley,We spent a week in the park. Rented a house in Wawona. First point is beware that AC is not in almost any rentals. Not an issue during the evening hours. Also know this is not a park that you drive in and look. If you want to experience and see this park you must hike and most are strenuous. With that said the Mist Trail is a must. Not for elderly or young. It is both strenuous and intimidating if you don't hike some. The reward is worth it. Tuolumne Meadows is also a must. Go first in the morning at sunrise or close to it and see the many Mule Deer. Glacier Point and Hetch Hetchy are also worth the drive. This is a busy park in the summer with very little parking. Shuttles are there but can take time. Go early to find a parking spot and then use the shuttle accordingly. ,"July 2, 2017",Incredible ,6,"San Francisco, California",5
Yosemite Valley,"I started researching our first trip to Yosemite about two years before our trip this past May. To reserve the rooms we needed and where we wanted to stay, I made the reservation exactly 365 days out. We are fortunate enough to be able to travel before the high tourist season. We were in Yosemite Valley from Monday thru Friday before Memorial Day. They were paving roads so some of the normal roads were closed or made to be one-way, etc. so at first it was very frustrating. However, once we parked our car....even in May.....we did not move it again until we were leaving for good. Yes, they need more buses but due to the construction, even the bus drivers were frustrated!Plan your visit carefully and leave yourself plenty of time to see things --- days, not hours.

Yosemite Valley,"We stayed in the park and took the shuttle bus to various hiking areas. The shuttles run regularly, but you may have to wait in line for two or three passes in busy areas.

There is a bit of a learning curve regarding destinations and the map provided could be more informative. While trails were wide enough for people to easily pass each other without difficulty, we sometimes saw people get annoyed and/or make comments when the person ahead of them slowed down. It was inspiring to see people of all ages and ability levels enjoying the trails; nature provided several logs/boulders to rest on when a break is needed. You can stop in different lodging areas for meals and to fill up your water bottles.

Guard at entrance gate was very helpful, as were other staff along the way. We had done quite a bit of homework before going as we only had the 2 days. Our visit coincided with plenty of rain having fallen and the snow melt and so the waterfalls and rivers were really in full force. We did the Mist Trail but it was really the Shower Trail, we were completely soaked through at the end. Well worth it. It is do gorgeous, every photo looks like a postcard. My only negative comment is just how busy the place was and there seem no limits to the number of vehicles they let in, but neither is there park and ride options. We came into the park around 10 and took till 12 to find a carpark. If this is how busy it normally is now on weekends (and I have no comparison) then something needs to be done.","June 28, 2017","Wow, spectacular",29,"Cambridge, New Zealand",5

If you come after that, you should attempt to park at the first available spot and utilize the hybrid buses that can take you anywhere in the valley. If you are doing the hikes, really be wary of the amount of water you have. You should have at least 1-2L of water, however, the park service recommends the amount of water you should have at each trailhead.

Yosemite Valley,"We spent a day hiking the Four Mile Trail up to Glacier Point which is actually 4.6 miles one way. It is all up hill with many switchbacks & an elevation gain of 3200 feet. We started at 8:00am and the trail was nearly all in the shade, but extremely buggy...make sure to use a deep woods bug spray and you won't have any issues. The trail is easy to follow because it has some sections with dirt, others with stones, and others with pavement so there is no risk of getting lost.The views are amazing and include El Capitan, Half Dome, and a waterfall. Once you make it to Glacier Point, you can purchase snacks such as Clif bars, ice cream , chips, soda...etc... and use the restroom.I highly recommend bringing a Camelback with 3 liters of water on days when it is hot. We also carried a Gatorade with us to drink. At the top we refilled our Camelbacks at the faucet.The way back down is an absolute killer on the knees and toes, but if you bring walking sticks it helps quite a bit. If you go down after 12pm the trail is nearly all in the sun and it gets extremely hot! Wear sunscreen!We were able to see some type of a grouse(bird) at the top that wasn't afraid of tourists near the look out points, but other than that not a lot of wildlife on the trail. However, we did see many different types of wild flowers in bloom along the way.This is a difficult trail and if you do not typically exercise on a regular basis, I would avoid it. It seems like taking a bus to Glacier Point and walking down this trail would be a bit easier, but still tough on your knees. I would not recommend this trail for children under 10 or so.","June 24, 2017",Incredible Hiking!,24,"altoona, ia",5
Yosemite Valley,"Was super disappointed when we visited mid May 2017. They had a higher than normal snow melt when I was there and because of this the park was FULL. Despite all my research I was still unprepared for the shear number of people and cars that were in the Yosemite Valley. We had one full day and were expecting some traffic as we'd driven the loop late the previous afternoon. We drove around for a few hours and still couldn't get a parking spot and this was mid week! There were cars parked EVERYWHERE. When you only have one day it's also pretty steep at $30/7 days and no single day option (not an issue for us as we upgraded to an annual pass for $80.We were able to see Yosemite falls but only from a distance and they were pretty spectacular as was the rest of the landscape. I would suggest if you're going then plan to be there before sunrise. You're more likely to get a parking spot and have more freedom in what you do.

Yosemite Valley,"My husband and I were at Yosemite this past May for 3 full days with our adult kids. This was one of the best trips we’ve ever been on as a family. We stayed at Evergreen Lodge about a 45 minute drive from Yosemite Valley. Driving into the Valley the first day we arrived around 9:30 AM and were unsure about where to start although I had picked up a couple trail & park books before the trip plus we had the map and information you get at the entrance to the park. It’s still so overwhelming when you get there. We parked on the road near Bridal Veil Falls and checked that out. This was an easy trail and gorgeous but plan to get very wet, at least in May. From there we drove further into the park and began looking for parking in one of the lots. We were lucky and found a spot in Shuttle Stop 7 across from Upper Yosemite Falls but most lots were already full and parking was getting difficult. I would suggest parking in a lot no later than 9:00 AM, leave your car there for the day and use the free park shuttle to get around. Also, if you plan to do these trails don’t skimp on footwear. Many trails are steep and rocky and often wet. I had Merrel hiking boots and they worked great for gripping. I’m turning 60 this year so I needed all the help I could get. Tennis shoes would be suicide shoes on many of these trails.Our first day we did easy and moderate trails like Bridal Veil; Lower Yosemite, Mirror Lake and the Mist Trail. The Mist Trail has a water station where the Mist and the John Muir Trail diverge to fill up water bottles. The second day we did the Upper Yosemite Trail which was HARD with no water stations. It was a full day commitment of around 6 or 7 hours. We made the mistake of not having enough water. This trail is steep with numerous switchbacks, hot and strenuous. Be sure to take plenty of water. There were places you could refill using water streaming off the mountain side if you have a filter system/filtering straw. I struggled with this trail but made it to the top. I found that there’s a place around half way up that offers a breathtaking view of Yosemite Falls and the Half Dome. I could have stopped there and gone back down and saved myself a lot of punishment. It seemed like once we made it to the top it was a bit anticlimactic as it was hard to view the Falls from the top even from the Viewing Deck because of the way the falls was tucked under the top of the trail. But it did give me bragging rights that I made it to the top! We also did Tuolumne Meadows to check out one of the giant Sequoia groves. The biggest grove, Mariposa, was closed for reconstruction of the roads. Tuolumne is significantly smaller but definitely worth checking out. We didn’t have any problem finding parking.On our last day we did Hetch Hetchy. We got there around 9:00 AM and felt like we had the place to ourselves. This was amazing after spending 2 days in the Valley. Hetch Hetchy has a very different vibe to it from the Valley—not as impressive but much more relaxing with trails that aren’t so strenuous and the absence of the Valley crowds plus you’ll see gorgeous Wapama Falls, one of the least crowded waterfalls in Yosemite.Main tips for the Valley: be sure to pack enough snacks and water. These trails can take hours to hike. We made sandwiches at our lodge and packed a cooler before heading to the park. Also, the roads in the Valley are busy and confusing. Just when we thought we knew the route to the parking lot areas they re-routed traffic completely because of road repairs. Plan to enter the valley early or late in the day—mid-day is crazy busy. The shuttle system is a necessary evil but we found the shuttle pick-ups sporadic with no clear schedule and then jam-packed once one would finally show up, at least in May. Hopefully that improves in the summer. Signage in the park is less than great; the guy behind me on the shuttle said it hadn’t changed since the park was established, lol. As far as food in the Valley, there’s a pizza place but we never were able to find it. I kept thinking Yosemite would be like Yellowstone with amazing lodges and dining opportunities and maybe it is—we just weren’t able to locate them in bumper to bumper traffic during peak times of the day.","June 20, 2017",A Breathtaking Challenge,33,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",5
Yosemite Valley,"Of the many ways to get around Yosemite Valley, my favorite was driving from spot to spot, then walking around and marveling in the grandeur that surrounds you. This is best done early in the morning or at dusk when the crowds thin out in the summer. We visited in June and had no issues with parking at any point of interest after 7 PM. For two hours, we explored parts of the Valley and had many areas to ourselves (Bridalveil Falls, Cooks Meadow, Sentinel Bridge). We saw deer, took way too many pictures, and had that peaceful park experience that many crave when enjoying national parks. If possible, enjoy the Valley in this manner and soak in the solitude and tranquility that dusk ushers in as darkness falls on America's crown jewel: Yosemite.","June 20, 2017","Drive, Shuttle, Walk, Be Still",18,,5
Yosemite Valley,I hadn't been to Yosemite in years. It's a must-see destination. We like to visit Yosemite every other year or so.

Yosemite Valley,Yosemite is indeed everything you could imagine and more. We were fortunate to be there in early June when the waterfalls are full and raging. It is a unique experience that would be missed by mid summer. Tioga Pass Road remained closed until July due to heavy snow. Getting there in early morning affords better access. This park is very crowded. You will need to take the free shuttles to various sites due to lack of parking options with the large crowds. The shuttles also become packed which may alarm those with claustrophobia. It is a very worthwhile experience but not without its challenges due to the volume of visitors. Food options are also limited.,"June 20, 2017",Amazingly Beautiful,13,"Edgewood, Kentucky",5

They know alot of the good secrets because they live around the places. The gal there filled us in with sites to see, then told us 600 inches of snowin a portion of the park. Wow that is amazing amount of snow. So lots of beautiful montains and water falls, but you might want to get the park early as parking becomes a premium. That is the bummer got to the village in the park and no place to park. So had to work our way back out of the park. A day cut short due to no room to park your ride.

In fact, a person fell in the Falls the day before and was missing. We stuck to the trails and didn't have any problems. We enjoyed lower Yosemite Falls, Vernal Falls, Mirror Lake, etc. It was less crowded than the upcoming summer months, but even the current crowds were more than enough.

Perfect for Avoiding traffic, finding places to park. Ride all around and stop for sites, trails. Worth every penny!!!2. Glacier Point at Sunset!! Beautiful and a lot of photographers doing time- lapse photos. Ranger gave great talk. 3. Hiked Mist trail to Vernal Falls.

Just hope for a sunny day, and admire one of nature's best showpieces, Yosemite Valley.

Yosemite Valley,"We were driving into the Valley, just past the turnoff for Glacier Point Road. There was a car with an RV trailer driving about 15 MPH. When we finally could pass him I looked over & his face was slack, his mouth was open & there was a look of...awe. This is how I felt too when you first see Yosemite Valley. It's almost too much. We were there for 7 days & 4 were spent hiking & sightseeing one of the most beautiful valleys in the USA. This is not just an American destination, it's an International one. We met people there from all over the world. It pays to have some courtesy. 1. GET THERE EARLY!!! Take your shower the night before. Grab something simple for breakfast. Arrive at 0800 (or earlier).  2. The best place for day parking is the large day lot next to Yosemite Valley Lodge, across the road from Camp 4. We found the closer you can get to the Lodge the better. You can walk a trail across the road to Yosemite Falls, the visitor center, ect. The Lodge has a shuttlestop, a cafeteria & a gift shop. GET THERE EARLY! This lot looks large, but fills up fast (before 0930). You'll be one of those poor guys driving endlessly looking for a spot. 3. Lots of hiking options. Even if you're not a hiker, you'll still want to walk across Cooks Meadow or Sentinel Meadow. Lots of photo opps. You'll want to see Yosemite Falls, which is just a short walk. The Visitor Center is worth a look. There are 2 films that take under an hour to view. Well worth the time to relax & rest your feet. 4. Later in the afternoon, when you're wore out from everything you've done. Take a lawn chair out into the meadow, or by the river. Sit down & just relax & contemplate the beauty around you. Watch the endless stream of cars & be glad it's not you inside them!","June 14, 2017",Do it smart!,456,"Westville, Indiana",5

Yosemite Valley,"There's probably little I can say that hasn't been said about Yosemite Valley. I've been visiting for almost 30 years. The crowds are always there in the summer. Thank goodness for the shuttle. Parking is a premium. Visiting in the winter is a completely different scene and way less crowded. When we visit Yosemite, we spend most of it hiking and exploring outside the valley to get away from crowds. I will also say that we do pick a time to go into the valley each visit because it is so special. If we want to spend more time there, we plan way in advance and stay in the valley to avoid excess driving. Consider joining the Yosemite Conservancy while you are there. Paying admission supports the NPS and that's important. Donating to the Conservancy supports a multitude of projects. It is impossible to visit Yosemite without benefitting from a Yosemite Conservancy project. ","June 13, 2017",Nothing like it,36,"Sebastopol, California",5
Yosemite Valley,"How can one even put in writing the beauty of Yosemite Valley. I've been going there for 50+ years and am always in awe of it. No matter where you turn the view is spectacular. Due to a great California winter the waterfalls were amazing this time and in places possibly unseen in drier years. We even saw a good layer of snow as we headed into the Valley from Oakhurst. We only went for the day so we took in the highlights, but every stop is a highlight, so I'd suggest a week to really take it all in. Back in the 70's my sister spent a couple months there and loved it. If planning a trip I'd suggest early June before the crowds arrive and while the falls are at their peak. My kids (now young adults) loved it and can't wait to return. My wife and I wholeheartedly agree. Tip: bring binoculars.","June 13, 2017",Stunning ,28,"Los Angeles, California",5

It is our favourite hiking destination to date!Unfortunately, Yosemite Valley is extremely poorly managed given the number of people and traffic. The Yosemite Valley Shuttle System is extremely unreliable. The Yosemite Guide advertises that it runs every 10-20 min. However, the sign at the shuttle stops says every 20-30 min, and realistically, it's closer to every 30-40 min. There are not enough shuttles to accommodate everyone so many are left behind, waiting for that elusive next shuttle.

The free shuttle buses were a great way to get around, we parked our car as soon as we got to our camp site and didn't get back in it until we left to go home.

Also, finding a parking space is almost impossible, unless you arrive very early or late (after 6 pm). And on top of that the valley is flooded because of the heavy rains and snow runoff this year, so you can’t easily walk from one side to the other. My advice would be to arrive very early or late, and plan on not moving your car once you’ve found a parking space; use the shuttles instead.

I don't know when it's a good time to go, but way out of season to really enjoy the park would be my guess. We have been to 35 national parks and have never seen anything like the traffic and congestion, although admittedly we always avoid high season. I'm not sorry we went, but we will never go to Yosemite again. Things may have been a little worse at this point in the year because the waterfalls are so spectacular after the heavy snow, but the traffic, lack of parking, road detours and closures, and flooding all worked to make this almost an unpleasant experience.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite is an absolutely breathtaking park. Everyone should make sure to make it a goal to get there sometime in their lifetime. If you love to hike, camp, rock climb, horseback ride, fish, or just enjoy the outdoors you will be amazed at the beauty of all that there is to see here. During my last visit on April 15/16th 2016 it was National Park Week and everyone got free admission into the park. I heard this happens once a year for an entire week. It is usually $25 a car to enter. Inside the park they was a free shuttle which drops you off at different locations. This shuttle was perfect for getting around the park because it brought to your hotel or to the starting point of particular hikes. You also can walk to each location but it would take you a long time. The shuttles run all day long until 12 midnight. There are several different hikes you can take which are include easy, moderate, hard, and strenuous. Ask for a map of the hikes so you can choose a hike that fits your needs. The map explains how long it should take, the mileage and conditions to expect on the hike. On my two trips here I have hiked Nevada falls, Vernal Falls, Lower Yosemite Falls, Upper Yosemite Falls and Half Dome without the cables. All hikes were amazing. -Vernal falls is 2.4 miles long and takes about 3 hours with a 1000 feet elevation gain. Shuttle stop 16. To walk up to the waterfall one has to walk up some steep steps where the mist of waterfall falls on you. Depending on the weather that could be a good or a bad thing. There is a steep granite stairway of over 600 steps so be prepared for the area to be slippery. So you need to be careful. You will have an excellent view of Vernal Falls from the footbridge about a mile in.-Yosemite Falls is one of the tallest waterfalls in North America and in the world. It has over 70 switchbacks and will take an average person 6 to 8 hours. We were running up and down the hills so it took us 4 but that is at the highest speed possible. I suggest you take your time and enjoy the scenery because it's worth slowing down and taking longer. Depending on the weather you maybe walking in the cold and the heat or just one of those. There are shaded and sunny areas throughout the hike. The views at the top are priceless and worth every step! If you can manage a difficult hike, I would suggest this hike for some of the best views in the park. -Lower Yosemite Falls is pretty too. You will be walking at the bottom of the waterfall. It's great for a leisure walk with pretty views. If uphill is hard for you or you would just like to take a walk, this hike is perfect. You can see a beautiful view of the waterfall and get great pictures. Tips-I usually don't bring waters on my hikes, but all these day hikes require food and water. We also brought headlamps, a first aid kit, a hiking pack and proper hiking boots. I never knew the difference between hiking shoes and regular hiking boots but they make all the difference in the world. My hiking boots helped my feet stay nice and dry because we walked in a lot of water and snow. There was snow on Nevada Falls and Vernal Falls. I have also rented a bike and rode all around the park. It was very nice and you got to see a lot of the scenery. It was very easy to get lost so make sure to get a map and ask people for help.  You can camp in the park or you can stay in a hotel. There are several hotels to choose from, or you can choose a hotel right outside the park like we did. If you camp in the park you need to have a permit. If you plan on camping you will need to have bear proof containers, you're not allowed to keep any food in your car because of the bears. You do need to be cautious of the wildlife, there are deers everywhere. It's possible that you could run into a bear and there are safety precautions they want you to follow. If you do see a bear you should be as loud as possible and make as much noise as you can. If you're with more than one person stand together so you appear more intimidating and definitely keep your distance.Drive the speed limit! The most common human related cause of death for a bear in Yosemite is being hit by a car.In emergency situations there are Rangers that are there to help, but it's better to come prepared so you will not need them. During the time we came it was pretty cold, but the week before that it was snowing. Anytime you hike it's best to dress in layers, that way if it gets too cold or too hot you will be prepared. If you forgot to pack anything there is an awesome store inside the park that has absolutely everything you need. In fact I got overwhelmed with all the choices of snacks and food they carry. If you need a souvenir this would be your spot and they have everything like T-shirts, mugs, or toys for the kids. The park is absolutely beautiful and definitely worth a trip!","June 4, 2017",Beautiful ,40,"Los Angeles, California",5

We visited just after Memorial Day weekend and the crowds were not bad at all. So much to see and do. You can take a tram, you can drive, you can bike, you can hike. There are views of everything for those who are not very mobile and there are hikes for all other levels of ability.

Yosemite Valley," I would like to focus my review on families with children. This limits your flexibility, for example you will probably have to check for available restrooms every once in a while and the children can get tired very soon after walking a long distance. As for the park and its beauty, I have very little to add. However, I would like to point out those sites in the park that are especially easy to reach with children.First, you need to check if you get lodging inside the valley or if you don't. In my opinion, lodging inside the valley is preferable. You can for example return to your room if needed and especially, you don't have to get up early in the morning which you usually must if you are outside of the valley to avoid traffic jams.Then, if you are able to shift your visit, make sure that the weather is good. Of course this is not entirely foreseeable, but good weather makes a huge difference. Good weather also gives you more flexibility to hire bikes with a trailer, which I don't imagine nearly as pleasant when it rains. Naturally, even without children good weather is better than bad weather, but with children, it makes even more of a difference.Once you get there, make sure you hire those bikes with the trailer. Two children in one trailer. Going by bike is usually pleasant, you are very flexible and the children enjoy it, too. In contrast, I found the shuttle buses to be excessively crowded and not reliable when you need them. For instance, at 16, one of the most popular stops, we once had to wait more than 40 minutes for the bus. You do not need this when you have bikes. Make sure to get them early, since trailers easily run out late in the morning.If you can't do the long walks, I would recommend the magic isles, at bus stop 16, the waterfalls and in general walking with in the valley and watching the wonderful mountains.One more thing: paper map works well here. Your cell phone will only work near the village, but not for example in the majestic hotel, and not further inside the Valley. Download the relevant parts of Google maps the alternative system you use if you wish to rely on these services. However, neither Google nor Here Maps accurately mapped the walking trails. Paper maps are available for free. Also outside the valley, cell phone works in some areas and not in others (for instance, no reception at Yosemite View Lodge).Finally, if you have to find a parking spot, I would advise that you park at the Lodge, the first parking possible. The less you have to drive inside the valley, the better.","June 2, 2017","Great for families, but crowded - here's some advice",4,,5
Yosemite Valley,"The waterfalls are as full as they've been in 35 years. We visited the week before Memorial Day and already found the Valley quite crowded. The bus drivers need a little more training in friendliness, but it's breathtaking so just keep looking up and you'll be glad you took the time to visit Yosemite.

Yosemite Valley,"Very beautiful and busy place. We made two full day trips into the park, one on the first of the week and the second three days later. Yosemite is a very beautiful place where ever you are at. There were a lot of people and cars, trucks, MotorHome s and construction equipment. The second trip in a few days later it felt like things doubled. I would recommend you should go in and find an area to park and take a park shuttle, a lot less stressful. There were a lot of detours and areas blocked so you could not pass through or park. Because of the great snow fall this year, was a lot of runoff and the waterfalls are beautiful! The river and streams are over flowing and that helps add to parking problems. Camping was plentiful, but need reservations.A wonderful trip!!!","June 2, 2017",First trip to Yosemite,24,"Boise, Idaho",4

Yosemite Valley,"We were just there a few days ago in May. There was a lot of snow this winter and the waterfalls were spectacular. We were told that by July, they will be non-existent. And some years, when there is drought, there are no falls. So, we hit it perfectly! We took the Yosemite Valley Floor tour which was excellent. We bought tickets in advance ($25/each), but sometimes they can be available the same day. It was definitely worth the money. It was an open air tram that seated about 40 people. Our guide, Brianna, was excellent. The tour lasted about 2 hours (1 rest stop at a shed in the woods). After that, we took the shuttle bus to The Majestic Hotel for lunch, and then went to the Yosemite Visitor Center and saw a video. When we picked up our tour tickets at the Yosemite Valley Lodge, the man at the counter gave us great advice. Come to the park early, park your car, and use the shuttle buses the rest of the day. When we were there last month, it wasn't even incredibly crowded, and there were still lots of cars. During the summer season, I'm sure it can be very difficult to navigate. There is a cafeteria in the lodge that was good for breakfast.","June 1, 2017",Awesome!,70,"Hilltown, Pennsylvania",5
Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite is an amazingly beautiful place but you already know that. In my review are some of the things that you might not know. So in the spirit of being prepared, I talk about about some of the more unpleasant aspects that you might not be expecting.We were in California to visit my son who is in the Navy and unfortunately, Memorial Weekend was the only time we could visit. The amount of people and cars in the park this weekend affected our visit but we were part of that problem, too, I guess. Despite the crowds (and lots of very rude people) we made the most of our 2 days. Our first piece of advice is to arrive very early. On Saturday we got to the park around 7:45am and parking was almost full already. We were lucky that they had just opened a new parking lot the day before or we would have been out of luck (or on the side of the road miles away). The traffic can be very bad and in fact we missed our Valley Floor Tour on Sunday because of it.Once parked, rely on the park shuttle to get around because you'll never find another place to park. With that said, be sure you know which lines are running! We sat at one stop for about an hour and when the shuttle arrived to go to Bridalveil Falls (which is on the shuttle map) the driver rudely informed me that he was the only driver working that route that day and he was not going there. Traffic affects the shuttles, too. Although they claim to run every 30 minutes, it can be longer than that between them but then they will arrive 2 or 3 at a time. And if only 5 people get off a full shuttle, only 5 can get on. Be prepared for a wait or walk.There are lots of bathrooms everywhere (but not all flush toilets and some were actually pretty gross). Bring hand sanitizer. If you can hold it, wait until you get to one of the hotels where the facilities are cleaner.Although you should get there early, nothing opens until 9am! Not the visitor's center, not the galleries, nothing. be prepared and plan your days before you get there. If coming from the west through Mariposa (the day before) go the their visitor's center which is spectacular.Just be prepared to wait for things and for crowds. Be patient and you'll get the photos you want (people were great about taking family photos for us and we returned the favor). Enjoy the beauty. Take a breath.","June 1, 2017",As gorgeous as I expected (but far too crowded),32,"Freeport, Maine",5
Yosemite Valley,What on earth could motivate anyone to try to go to Yosemite during Memorial Day? Good grief! Hours long jams of non-moving traffic to get to do what?

Yosemite Valley,"Wow!! First word came out my mouth when I first see the place.. it's scenery accent with falls, tall trees, limestones and crick. I can say that this is a must to visit whenever you are in California. The place is located in Fresno (between SANFO and LA). This well reserved forest is an epitome of nature. I will probably comeback and take the adventure on the top.","May 31, 2017",Nature at its best,11,"Doha, Qatar",5
Yosemite Valley,"We went to Yosemite early in the season to avoid crowds...but there were a LOT of people there. Especially in the valley. As noted in a review of Glacier Point, we were told there were larger crowds than usual because there was so much rain/snow this past winter that the rivers/waterfalls were more beautiful than in the past few years. Being from the eastern time zone, we did get into the park very early (6AM) and enjoyed those early times so much more. The Yosemite Falls and Bridal Veil Fall were stunning...the mist from the latter just does something for the soul. We took a short walk to the Chilnualna in the south part of the park and found that area free of crowds and a beautiful, close up experience.

This time we had gone during the Memorial weekend and the valley was overflowing with cars. The shuttle busses were not dependable and parking was almost impossible to find.

I would recommend that you rise early and be in the park by no later than 7;00am in order to secure parking and experience all that the valley has to offer. I believe that the park really needs to explore some parking or more shuttle busses outside the park to bring in tourists, as the summer and holidays are really bad traffic wise in the park and made it difficult to manuver.

Me and wife climbed to the top of the waterfall which was very challenging but so worth it. The view from the top is amazing and we met so many great people along the way up. All the guides say the walk should take 7 hours - we were up to the top in about 2.5 with a fairly average fitness level, and were down in about 2.

I highly recommend taking the YARTS into the valley as there are so many cars and not enough places to park. We did not even take the Valley shuttles as they were so crowded this Memorial Day weekend. Instead we walked everywhere including part of the Valley Loop Trail. This was the bet part because it is so peaceful and beautiful. As it is so full of water and waterfalls everywhere, it was fun getting our feet soaking wet while we had to cross small creeks (water level below the knees).","May 29, 2017","Walk everywhere, the views are stunning",7,"Los Angeles, California",5

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite is SPECTACULAR. Natural beauty beyond words or pictures. Winter snowfall brought forth magnificent rivers, streams and waterfalls. We could hardly believe our eyes; so beautiful. We stayed in Oakhurst and it took 1.5 hours to drive to the Valley Floor on a very winding narrow road; no guard rails. To do it again, we would definitely bite the price point bullet and stay in one of the lodges in the park on the valley floor. You must plan ahead as reservations are required up to a year in advance - maybe more. It would be a treat to wake up and go to sleep surrounded by this beauty as sunrise and sunsets are amazing; can’t imagine how great the starry nights must be :) We were there in early May so crowds were not at capacity, however, it was still crowded, especially as the day wore on. We arrived at Tunnel View around 7:30 AM and had the parking lot to ourselves; later in the day you could not get near it… Same with other major points of interest with available parking. Go early and stop along the way for viewing and pictures; must get parking while the getting is good! Highly recommend taking the Valley Floor Tour; very wonderful, informative and a great way to see many of the major sights without the worry of driving and parking. You should secure reservations in advance for the tour as well. Price for tour was $32 per adult; well worth it. Bring water and snacks. Food and drink is available but pricey and crowded. Good footwear is a must; check the weather and dress accordingly. It was 38 degrees when we drove in and near 70 when we drove out… Enjoy!","May 29, 2017",SPECTACULAR!

Yosemite Valley,"I did know better than to visit Yosemite on Memorial Day weekend but family was visiting and they wanted to see it and Memorial weekend Sunday was the only day available. The park was packed with bumper to bumper traffic everywhere. The Park Service did a decent job with directing and parking was available to Glacier Point which is a must see. Had to wait in a 2 hour line for the shuttle to Glacier Point. The area still had snow so the trails were a little hard to navigate. If you are going to Yosemite suggest you get to the Park Entrance no later than 8am. We got there at 9:15 and had a 45 minute wait to get in with traffic. Didn't leave the park until 8pm but saw everything except Vernal Falls. Plenty of bathrooms around the park but most of them are portable. Park is worth the time but would suggest seeing it during the week and not on a major holiday. Met some very nice people from all over the world. What to see? We enjoyed Yosemite falls, half dome, El Capitan, Valley View, Lembert dome but a 3 mile hike. Tunnel View is easy. Cathedral Peak and Bridalveil falls. Nevada falls also. Plenty of nice picknicking areas but bring spray for mosquitoes as they were quite bad in some places. The visitor center folks were very nice and helpful. Food is available in the park but we brought our own. Gas for the car is available in the park also. If you are a senior you can ask for the $10 special that will be for your hole car load and the pass is for lifetime and you can use it at all national parks. You have to ask for it though.

Yosemite Valley,"Went on a Sunday (also Mother's Day in US). FIrst part of planned trip, to get as much as possible out of single day there, went well, taking in Tunnel View and Washburn Outlook on fantastically scenic route to Glacier Point. Unfortunately, then got stuck in stationary traffic on last descent to Glacier Point, and finally gave up, turned around with the intention of going into Yosemite Valley to park up and take the shuttle bus to various points where we could take some walking trails. Queued in the tunnel for ages on the way back, then queued in two lines to try and get to the valley. By this stage there were signs saying all car parks were full and to expect long delays. We decided to give up, but it still took 40 minutes to get to a point where we could turn back towards the exit. Don't know how early we would have to have started to fulfill our planned trip, or how packed the shuttle buses would have been.

Yosemite Valley,"Gets VERY busy around noon till about 5pm, with snail-like traffic. I recommend getting there in the morning and staying till the evening - it's so delightful driving around the valley with no traffic around sunset! Also, if you can't find parking at the lots, try the other attractions like across the street from Housekeeping or the Majestic Hotel (both of which we parked in - parking is only for 30min at the visitor's center). The valley is STUNNING. The park ranger at the visitor's center recommended to walk down from the center to the meadows just across the street, with great views of Yosemite Falls, Half Dome, and more. (Plus the meadows are just beautiful!) She told us we'd feel the spray if we went up the small trail to the falls, but be warned that you will get WET! (Unless you go when the falls are smaller, like later in the year.) It's really cold, shady, windy, and wet, but it's worth it and just so fun! (Especially if you're walking around in the heat.) The trail to get there is also adorable and very easy.The El Capitan stop on the shuttle bus is a little too close to get a good view - I recommend being much further away, like by Valley View or Tunnel View. Tunnel View was probably my favorite view other than Glacier Point, which you absolutely should make the drive up to, especially just before sunset. It overlooks Half Dome, the valley, and more to the east which is mostly accessible only by hiking, and it was AMAZING!Bridalveil Falls is also worth it. It has a very short, but very steep trail up to it, and the water was just flooding the path and even part of the parking lot, so if you don't want to get even more soaked than Yosemite Falls, getting up close is not for you. Swinging Bridge is a good walk from the shuttle stop, but it's really worth it and is so relaxing on the river - plus it has a fantastic view.Something no one really told us about was the long, but easy walk to Mirror Lake, just under Half Dome. Mirror Lake really is just like a mirror and goes right along the rushing river - loved it! It's totally worth it, BUT if you're there in the evening (like we were), you MUST have bug spray as the mosquitoes are ravenous and gigantic and WILL bite you through your clothes, and especially on your face. Also if you're there in the evening, note that the shuttles slow down to every 20-30 minutes depending on the time, so the mosquitoes will eat you while you wait for the bus. If this happens, I recommend the short walk to the next shuttle stop, the Stables, where the mosquitoes are slightly less (but still intense).I don't recommend the very steep walk in Tuolumne Grove (or Merced Grove, which is smaller) because the giant sequoias are few and far in between, and otherwise it's just a forest walk. If you have more time than a day, Hetch Hetchy Reservoir is a bit of a drive, but it's really, really beautiful and worth it - we had our lunch overlooking the reservoir with its two waterfalls on the side, and it was just so peaceful. Tioga Road (which is supposed to be the most scenic drive in Yosemite) and Mariposa Grove (giant sequoias) were closed for snow and restoration, respectively, so we didn't get a chance to see those, but if you do, definitely check them out!Oh, and make sure you read all the plaques around the park - they really teach you a lot about interesting things like how fire is important for sequoia reproduction and what the valley was like when it was first discovered by American settlers. A side note if you're bringing an RV/trailer in - do NOT take the Old Priest Grade road, which takes you off 120 (Google Maps will suggest it). There is a sign that says trailers prohibited, but we missed it at night and went up the very steep road that our truck and RV trailer were not supposed to be on - our engine almost overheated. It's also an $800 fine if you bring a trailer on that road. A lot of people apparently make this mistake, so we were surprised the signage was not intensified.Lastly, don't forget to look up at the stars!!","May 27, 2017",Spectacular Views Everywhere You Look,3,"Keller, Texas",5

The infrequent YARTS service and lack of large parking lots with logical YARTS access at park entrances, and the lack of vacation passenger rail between the Merced and Fresno Amtrak Stations and YARTS access points at the park entrances means the majority of park visitors have no viable options for accessing the Valley other than by the private automobile, posing sever traffic congestion and air quality issues with vehicular delays in excess of 3 hours.

Need to be in pretty good shape. Watch the sunset at Glacier Point. About an hour drive up but worth it. We even ran into snow on the way up (in June!). Took a small little hike and dip in mirror lake. Only regret is not having longer to explore the park. SO much to see. Also, we would have loved to camp there.

Yosemite Valley,"Yes, the Yosemite setting is INCREDIBLY, ""beyond-words"" beautiful and awe- inspiring... but, unfortunately, the woefully inadequate shuttle system put a real damper on what should have been a far more enjoyable and (positively) memorable experience for our family. My advice to anyone headed there is to: 1) lower your expectations as to how helpful and efficient the shuttle system will be, 2) reduce the number of sites you have planned to see that day, and 3) plan to walk to and between the stops that aren't far apart.We experienced very delayed shuttles and then when they finally arrived only a portion of the people at the shuttle stop could actually get on the bus. The rest had to wait for the next one, or the one after that.... Also adding to our frustration, two of our shuttles required that after riding it for a few stops, we then had to get off and transfer to different shuttles, which of course required having to wait for yet another delayed shuttle. On one of our shuttles, I think we had the same ""psycho"" driver ""youcrazydog"" referred to. I, too,thought she was extremely rude and seriously lacking in customer service skills. She complained a number of times that ""it's been like this for the past year"" and suggested that riders direct their complaints to the NPS and the shuttle system contractor because the drivers' complaints to them were ignored. We also had a driver who announced to the riders that he would be making an additional stop. He tried to joke that it would be for an hour; it wasn't, thankfully, BUT it was at least 10 minutes. So during those 10 minutes, a full bus of passengers is sitting in a running bus waiting for him to come back. Where did he go and why? Who knows. We did have one very pleasant and helpful driver who made a point of keeping our family of 4 together on one of the many stops where only a few people could get on the bus. A number of times throughout the day I wondered to myself ""if it's this bad in May, I can't imagine how bad it could be in June/July/August."" An even more immediate concern is for those people who will be here in 2 days over Memorial Day weekend! Best of luck-- I hope your experience is different from ours.","May 24, 2017",Woefully inadequate shuttle system!,0,,2

Also right now there is a lot of construction of trails so there are detours and we found it a little confusing where to go for long term parking. The first place we parked was only 30 min parking and we didn't notice that until we were out of car. There was just a temp sign placed in a random spot.

Too many people, on paths, on shuttles, in lines, terrible.---and we were there in off season during the week! We have been to 7 countries and countless hotels the past few years, and this is the first time we had to wait until after 4pm to check into our room----the staff at reception seemed nice enough--but come on---we paid 275$ for 19 hours in a dated mediocre room. The eggs were premix and food was generally below average and the price is high on everything. I must say the waterfall was spectacular---but it wasn't worth all the aggravation--especially the buss drivers yelling and passing us up while waiting at stops--just blowing by.

Yosemite Valley,"We drove up to the Yosemite valley in mid May, 2017, taking the route next to the Merced River. The view on the trip was outstanding. Upon entering Yosemite Valley the heights of the redwood trees and the amazing rock formations were some of the most beautiful natural resources that I have seen. Due to the abundant snowfall in the mountains, we were able to experience seldom seen forceful huge waterfalls. I walked up one of the paths which led to a bridge from which you stood so close to the waterfall that the spray of the falls would soak you if you stayed there very long. It was an awesome view! One photo location that you can't miss is Tunnel View. I had a canvas picture made of my wife and I from a picture taken at that location.","May 23, 2017",Beautiful Yosemite Valley,2,"Orland Hills, Illinois",5

White blossoms everywhere except high elevation. purple Lupins all along the road sides. We will never go on the weekend again for the traffic was horrendous!!!! When we were there on Friday, the park was to ourselves just about. Being Mothers Day weekend did not help either. Just a beautiful place.

You will see deer and many birds and small animals. We have been visiting for thirty years and this has been one of the greatest most scenic springs. Expect crowds on weekend--bumper to bumper. If driving consider parking at one of the main areas and then taking the shuttle bus around. We were here on a Monday so it was very doable. We started by visiting Bridal Veil falls. Phenomenal. Glad we had boots! So much water and this is not even peak runoff yet. We later parked near the Conte chapel and walked through the meadow and then to lower Yosemite Falls. Great trail and bridges. Again expect to get wet! Onto Yosemite village and into the food court and the Mountain bar lounge. Have eaten at the restaurant and it was delicious with a fabulous view.

If you have any other days at all as options, I implore you to visit the valley those other days. We went during Memorial Day weekend last year and still enjoyed our trip and all the hikes, but not nearly as much as other trips. People in crowds tend to be more rude, and we witnessed a near physical altercation on one shuttle ride- so awkward that we opted to walk miles instead. Avoid Memorial Day if at all possible. We waited in line just to get into the park for 3 hours and friends that came later in the day waited for 5-6 hours...

I've been to a few national parks and while all are unique, this is the only one that had the same type of impact on me that the Grand Canyon did. We were only in the park for 3 days but I felt I could have stayed for a month. There are Rangers and volunteers just waiting for you to ask questions and they have vast amounts of knowledge to share with you. We loved the 2-hour ranger-led tram ride. It's a bit pricey but worth it - completely worth it. We signed up for a free post-sunset star gazing session, also led by a Park Ranger. It was only fair but being out under the stars and having Yosemite Falls in the background still left us very happy. We were exceptionally fortunate to be there this year as the winter brought so much rain and snow that the decade-long drought is now over. All the Falls are overflowing with water and according to the rangers, Glacier Point which is usually open by Memorial Day probably won't open till July 4. There is so much water that there are dozens of small, unnamed falls spouting fresh snow melt all over the park. If you are planning a trip or just thinking about it, go in the spring. May sees thousands of blooming dogwoods and that in an of itself is almost worth the trip. In May, it's warm during the day and cool at night.

Yosemite Valley,"This was my fifth visit to Yosemite, second time in the spring. The valley is amazingly beautiful. The views from the valley are spectacular as it is surrounded by cliffs and waterfalls. May is the best time to visit with the waterfalls really full and spectacular, and before the summer crowds arrive. In addition to the major waterfalls, there are many minor waterfalls in spring, which dry up the rest of the year. The downside to visiting before June is that glacier point Road is closed, glacier point provides the best views of the valley, there a great views pretty much anywhere through the valley!Best view points:Glacier pointTunnel view overlookColumbia rock on the Yosemite falls trailThe most spectacular Hikes from the valley are:Vernal & Nevada falls loop, via the Mist and John Muir trails- strenuous (easy-moderate to Vernal Falls foot bridge)Upper Yosemite falls trail - strenuous with serious elevation gainMirror Lake - easyFour mile trail - strenuous ","May 8, 2017",One of the most beautiful places on earth!!!,72,"El Cerrito, California",5
Yosemite Valley,"As you drive into the valley you are filled with the awe of nature at its best. Crowds are limited in early morning and parking was not an issue. The water in the Merced looked to be level 6! The falls were spectacular...the sound not unlike a more musical freight train. Stop at Fern Spring and fill your water bottle for fresh, cold spring water. Do it all...even with crowds every stop is a worthwhile spectacular experience. The park is ever changing and sometimes you catch a glimpse of a deer or bear. Try to take in lunch at the Majestic (always be Ahwahnee to me) for a 1920's CA craftsman experience of fine dining. Parking got a bit tight in PM so a tour is a good idea. Wear some good waterproof hiking shoes and layers in Spring as it can go from cool and wet to warm and mucky fairly quickly.

Yosemite Valley,"This is a must see park, better than Grand Canyon in my opinion. In early May there is little traffic and very easy navigating the Valley floor. Summer is tough, you will need extra patience and travel times added. Start planning your trip at least 6 months to a year in advance to get lodging. The Majestic is best for those that like something like Mariott or Lowes hotels. You will be very disappointed with the valley floor Yosemite Lodge. They are small 50s era buildings scattered around and although they did their best to make it more updated it's still no better than a Days Inn, the takeaway is that it's a good location. We drove by the Rush lodge which is in the park and new but saw that the view is of burned trees, so glad we did not choose this as it's quite a distance away from the valley floor on Rte 120. So for location bite the bullet and stay on the valley floor but spend the money for the Majestic Lodge.","May 5, 2017",Early May is the perfect time to visit ...Rte 120 is open!,4,TN,5

You'll be warned to store all your food and toiletries in special containers due to the black bears, but in general we felt rather safe.In this valley you'll easily recognize all the elements on your check list: el capitan, the brideveil fall, half dome and many more.

Exiting from the Yosemite tunnel, one comes across and incredible sight of the entire valley and a must photo stop for all tourists. The only drawback was that this time it was just too commercialised and packed with tourists, with heavy traffic jams on the roads, too many people crowding and walking on the trails, the restaurants and washrooms packed with tourists and this human pressure detracts from the absolute wonder of this attraction.","April 30, 2017",One of the greatest attractions of USA,23,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",4
Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite itself is magnificent. The falls are thundering, roaring this year because of the the rain-finally. This being said I caution everyone that the traffic/parking is crazy and it wasn't even May. ALSO getting into the park is so limited currently. Rte 120 through Tioga is probably still closed due to snow(check first). The other end of Rte 120 is closed due to very bad road damage during a winter storm. This leaves the route from Mariposa. This is 40 miles long and while it is pretty it is a two lane road with a big area that has one lane bridges with stop lights which cause serious backups that won't be fixed anytime soon. Google the Ferguson Project. There are also multiple detours and construction projects inside the park that cause significant traffic issues. Finally the signage within the park is sorely lacking, for a park of this stature they could do much better. I'm not trying to discourage you from going, just making sure you you need to allow for plenty of time to see everything.

We also saw some deers lying in the shrubbery - the wildlife encounters just add to the day.Entry to the park is $30 USD for a family sedan.Tip: if you are willing to drive to Yosemite, stay at Rushmore Creek lodge - very new and clean (better than the lodgings in the valley area).

Even if you will just drive through it is an great experience, you will see mountains both close up and in the distance, with high altitude waterfalls and rugged terrain. It is a good 4 hour drive from San Francisco and slighly shorter if you are driving from Sacramento. If you are not staying but want to see more of the nature and are up for a road trip then I would suggest continue on the smaller roads up to Lake Tahoe.

A savings of $30. If we could do it over, we wouldn't go on a free entrance day. The traffic was completely mad. All the roads into the Yosemite Valley were backed up and finding a place to park was near impossible. We ended up finding a place on the side of the road to park where we ate our lunch. So many gorgeous views of the mountain tops and waterfalls. We parked near the village (on the side of the road) walked to a really nice waterfall from there. I think it's just called Yosemite Falls. I would recommend filling your gas tank before entering the park because gas stations are limited and you can imagine quite expensive.

But if you been here before and Glacier Point I would highly recommend anybody to stay on Highway 120 if you're coming in from California if not get to 120 head over to 395 Lee Vining area there is so many views and lakes on this route unbelievable I love it 10 times better than the valley you'll see something new every time you go and never gets old.bThe traffic here is not nearly as bad but plan a whole day trip from the beginning of Entry to exit it's about $20 for a pass and the pass is good for 7 days, theres many campsites available along this route some first come first serve some you must have reservations. Bear enforcement is absolute must hear use the bins or they will throw you out after a warning. This is for everybody safety.

This includes where you want to stay, how much you want to spend, how much time you think you'd like to spend there, what time of year you want to go, etc. The second most important thing which needs mentioning is this: if you don't want to be around hoards of humanity, do NOT visit the park between mid April and early/mid October, and - if possible - conduct your visits during the week, as opposed to the weekends. Regardless of season, the time you visit is critical if you want to maximize your leisure/travel time in the park and minimize waiting in line or being stuck in traffic.","April 19, 2017","Put this place on your ""must-do"" bucket list.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite is undoubtably gorgeous. In Spring, the waterfalls are gushing and the scenery is lovely. However, the park is just not set up to handle the crowds of people. We have visited over a dozen national parks, and unfortunately, none has had as poor an infrastructure to move people around as I saw in Yosemite mid week (admittedly, it was the week of Good Friday). In other parks, you park and then take the shuttle. At Yosemite currently, there is a ton of construction. There is hardly any parking. There is no Visitor's Center parking (or signage for where exactly the Visitor Center is, and how to access it). The bus schedule to hiking points is awful - every 20-25 minutes. So crowds pile up, a bus shows up, and you can't get on it as there are too many people. Now you're waiting for another 20 minutes. You wait over 45 minutes to get onto a bus!On top of that, people don't wait in line. Just imagine a horizontal (instead of vertical) line of people waiting for a bus. So who ends up getting on is dependent on where exactly the bus stops and who can rush in first. Even if you get on, there is usually no place to sit. And it can take over 30 minutes to reach your stop. <You get the picture>.If you can, wait until the construction is over, and hope the park management can increase bus frequency to meet the crowd levels and have real parking lots instead of street side parking. Mariposa Grove is closed (probably a good thing, if they are dealing with similar crowds).The evening live shows are very difficult for kids to follow, so skip them (and watch the movie during the day) if you are visiting with family.This is the first park that I've seen that charges a fee for junior ranger programs as well.That said, Yosemite Lodge inside the park is highly recommended.

Once we reached Vernal Falls our daughter ran up the trail to Nevada Falls and back with youthful enthusiasm.I would not recommend going in the summer as the day tourists really crow the place.

Yosemite Falls, and Bridalveil Falls were great from every different perspective when seen from different parts of the valley. Illlilouette was amazing as seen from the Vernal Falls hike. Vernal Falls is great in Spring even when there isn't much rain so it looked fabulous as usual. We saw Sentinel, Horsetail,Ribbon, Royal Arch Cascades, Wildcat, Staircase (really looks like a staircase from the valley floor!), and so many more impromptu ones given the precipitation and recent snow/rain. The nice late evening strolls along the valley meadows provided fabulous views of the waterfalls, and the sun striking the granite cliffs at various angles made for spectacular memories. While nature was glorious, the shuttle service was a disaster as there some of the valley roads are closed because of construction. Thus the shuttle buses need to share the same paths as cars in some sections, and the detours are long (albeit with great views). The lines to get back on the shuttle are long so be ready to allocate 45 minutes to get from one part of the valley to the next.Also, avoid the weekends when the entrance to the park is free as it gets too crowded. If you do come, arrive before 8am, and start your hikes by 9am.

Rangers were enforcing this. And then the parking south of the main village is not open (the maps don't show this change). Parking is atrocious. Lucky to find one behind the store at the village. Found out later that there is lots of parking on the way out, south of Yosemite Falls. But who would know, for the maps are not up to date. Lots of roads that have normally been open are closed or only one way. It is not the same Yosemite as far as getting around, that it has been for decades - at least on April 15. So beware.

Road Trip!This works if you get to the park early.1.Start at Tunnel view, enjoy the view take a few pictures, then head back down the hill to2. Bridalveil Falls. If your there in the summer and the falls are dry you can skip the small hike to the base. Otherwise park the car (this lot is small and fills fast so another reason to get to the park early!) and walk up to the viewing area at the base of the falls (about 30 minutes round trip)3.After Bridalveil you'll continue on the 1 way road towards the main part of the valley. Just a bit up the road on your left is a parking area for Swinging Bridge, pull over and walk out on the bridge to enjoy a beautiful view of Yosemite Falls. (again, are you here early? It's quiet and peaceful in the early AM, not so much once the hoards of families show up to bbq and generally be annoying...) 4. After Swinging Bridge continue driving to Curry Village (tell the driver to keep their eyes on the road and pull over for a view whenever they want. This stretch of road between Swinging Bridge and Camp Curry is awe inspiring especially for the first timers. Drive to the far eastern overflow lot at the back of Curry Village, it's on the right side. Park the car (some people don't like the lot as it makes for a longer exit from the park but you're not leaving till later anyways), grab your daypack already filled with your lunch and water (lunch is bread, cheese, salami, crackers, cookies and a Nalgene bottle full of good red wine) and head east towards the north-east corner of the parking lot. There is a little used trail that will take you to Happy Isles. At Happy Isles you need to go to the main road and cross over the bridge to the other side of the river to access the Mist Trail.5. Hike up the Mist Trail to Vernal Falls,(bring a poncho and wear waterproof shoes in the Spring cause you WILL get wet), enjoy your lunch and please DO NOT climb over the railings, stupid people die here on a regular basis. Hike back down via the JMT.6. Hop on the shuttle bus at Happy Isles and make your way over to the Ahwahnee Hotel for a look around and a drink on the back patio, then shuttle bus to Yosemite Falls for a walk to the base of the falls. We always take the entrance to the right as your facing the falls, it's a loop trail. After the falls back on the shuttle bus to your car. 7. Upon exiting the park pull over at the base of El Capitan, there's a large meadow on your left, you can't miss it. Walk out into the meadow with your binoculars (you did bring a pair correct?) and take a look at the climbers making their ascent of El Capitan. If you can't find them just ask, people will be happy to point them out. (They look alot smaller then you'd think!)8. Head out and say goodbye to my favorite spot on the planet!","April 7, 2017",The Perfect Day in Yosemite,45,"Lodi, California",5
Yosemite Valley,We spent a day exploring Yosemite Valley on a guided tour through Rush Creek Lodge. Truly truly inconceivable beauty. Pictures don't even do it justice! We only stopped at some of top spots but I can see how you could dissolve yourself in this park for days on end!

Yosemite Valley,"Just the sight of Half-Dome or Yosemite Falls are awe-inspring. We only had one full day and did the Upper Yosemite Falls hike all the way to the top. The views of half-dome in the background and the falls in the foreground (with rainbows!) made for great photos! The hike was long and the view from the top could have been better, but there are so many hikes in this valley! Next time we will stay longer and hike some more.","April 5, 2017",Incredible!,20,"Troisdorf, Germany",5
Yosemite Valley,"There's many spots to pull over and park, both on the way in and out of the valley. I would recommend taking the time to stop at each point if possible. You get to see the beauty of Yosemite at different angles, and combo that with the different time of day when the sun shines down on it. To me, you just need to take it all in, and not be in a rush. If you are in a rush, you're in the wrong place. ","April 5, 2017",Take every turn off opportunity,24,San Ramon,5
Yosemite Valley,"Spent few hours in the falls and mirror lake. We were driving from the bay area, which i don't recommend since it is a long drive and you don't get much time in Yosemite.

Yosemite Valley,"There are a lot of tourists around. I can't even imagine how amazing this place would've been when it was mostly wild. Very beautiful and worth the trip for sure.When you come out, make sure you plan a few hikes. It's not really a place to drive into and drive out. The Visitor's Center took us an extra loop around to find- there was some road construction going on and it's tucked into a corner. So plot things out before you drive in so you know whereabouts to park.The walk to Bridal Falls was fun and easy as well as the hike to lower Yosemite Falls. My 6 year old made it with no problems. The lower Yosemite Falls has a wheelchair pathway as well.Overall, I am glad that we ended up staying outside of the valley (Evergreen Lodge) because we were REALLY in the woods out there and it was quite and peaceful.There were too many people there in the valley to really appreciate nature, I think. :)","April 3, 2017",Beautiful,50,"Peoria, Arizona",4

Merced river is just beautiful, have not seen that much water in it for years.

Once in the park we used the free shuttle service getting around. There was a meter of snowfall the night before we got there so it was amazing. Some of the longer trails were closed due to the large snow fall but we still did the 3 smaller hikes we wanted to do which was lucky. There is an information center, food court, and gift shop also. 100% worth visiting.","March 26, 2017",Absolutely Amazing!,47,"Gold Coast, Australia",5

Which is a very nice hotel but need around 15mins to 20mins to get to the Yosemite valley.Because of short time. We just did the 4 mile trail. Took bus tour up to glacier point and hiked down.

Yosemite Valley,"I have been many times to Yosemite. This was the first time in the winter I had gone though. The scenery was quite beautiful. Because of the cold weather it kept people away too. I can't go to Yosemite during normal seasons anymore; the amount of people is just disgusting. Some of the trails were closed do to the ice, but plenty were open. Some roads were also closed, but there were detours to get around that as well. The campgrounds are very well maintained and have everything you need for camping: fire pits, tables, bathrooms, even showers if you are ok with paying for them. There are stores around the main areas where you can buy literally anything you need and plenty you don't; so you don't have to worry if you forget something. There is a lot of history here and many things to see. This is a great place to take your family or friends. You can hike, explore, photograph, so many things! If you are into rock climbing, camp 4 is famous for it and has lots of climbing history as well. My only recommendation is to avoid the busy seasons if you can. You will have more fun and richer experiences not having to avoid crowds and fight for your chance to get pictures through out the park.","March 15, 2017",Yosemite is always beautiful.,9,"Fontana, California",4

Really friendly lot who work there too well worth finding some and making some new friends! The hiking is world class, honestly rarely seen anything like it, waterfalls, valleys, huge (and I mean huge) rocks and mountains and the constant danger of bears. What more could you want??

We enjoyed excellent weather in Yosemite Valley with stunning views and an extremely helpful guide.

Yosemite Valley,"Well you know they are killing the bucks because there are none to be seen and the animals you do see are passive and depressed. There coats are thin and shaggy and they just stand there. They cant' go near the water (in summer, too) because people are in there! It's tragic really. This place gets overloaded in the summer especially. They are also not properly grooming the Sequoias so the Giant Sequoia forest (which used to be an amazing wonder) is mixed up with redwoods. It's like forest service does not know what they are doing or don't want to work outdoors. Trash was everywhere, too.

We stayed for two weeks and did lots of climbing and hiking, and did the Half Dome cables twice, rock climbed Snake Dike and a few sports pitches on El Cap (sadly not a big wall), and we saw bears on three seperate occasions, among other animals. It is phenomenally beautiful and would recommend YNP for anyone interested in photography.","March 10, 2017",Great Adventure,0,"Chichester, United Kingdom",5

Yosemite Valley,We visited in the spring and all the waterfalls were raging. Some are not flowing heavily in the fall. The valley was open and very accessible. A shuttle bus service circles about 15 stops. You can get close enough to several waterfalls to get wet. Several laces to stay overnight from camping to cabins to typical motel to historic high end lodge. Several places to eat from deli to sandwich shop to restaurant to high end lodge dining room. South road to Maraposa giant Sequoia stand was open and has a nice hotel and restaurant. North road and other upland roads were still closed due to snow. Nice motels available just outside the park entrance but are about 11 miles from the Village. On busy summer days it might be best to stop at a parking lot before the village and take the shuttle to all stops because parking in the village gets crowded. A spectacular place well worth the visit. ,"March 7, 2017",Amazing waterfalls,27,"Indian River, Michigan",5
Yosemite Valley,"I have been fortunate to have been going here on and off for decades, in all seasons. It is truly a breathtaking place. After being in a city or suburb, going to Yosemite really hits home how much humans have changed their environment to control it. It is wonderful to hike and see wildlife and waterfalls and all the grand vistas. Make sure to wear shoes with good tread and take water and food and let others know where you are going and when you're planning to be back. There are easy and safer, walks and also very challenging hikes available. I've been to Half Dome and glad I did it - it's not for everyone. There are many informational ranger talks and activities for families in the lower areas which are good.

Yosemite Valley,"We visited Yosemite Valley end February. We were lucky to have beautiful sunny weather. Getting there had been hard though, with two entry routes namely through Fish Camp and Buck Meadows closed. The valley is very nice with mirror lake, all the waterfalls and much more. Even with so many entries closed and being a weekday in February, it was crowded. Guess it must be winderness-disneyland in summer. We also did a hike outside the Valley where we were basically alone to admire all nature greatness. One thing really annoying is the tire chains issue. You need to carry with you tite chains in winter but with rental cars this is a problem. They do not hire them, we tried several car rental companies. So we had to buy them which was also easier said then done, as most shops run out (end winter). In the end, we found one last pair at O' Reilley's for about 90 dollar. Never had to use them so in the end just had to leave them behind. I do understand that chains could suddenly be needed and that you need them, but please work with local companies or put on the website where people can rent them. This is really very annoying for visitors with rental cars and a total waste! ","February 26, 2017",Breath-taking but do not only visit the Valley and i hate tire chains,46,,4

Yosemite Valley,"This amazing National Park was on my bucket list for years and I was finally able to visit it last year. One of the most iconic parks in the USA and with great reason. If you visit California I highly suggest taking time to come here. I can guarantee you will not regret it!! The views of El Capital from the Valley are unbelievable. It tends to be very crowded at all times but you may be able to beat some of the crowds and find better parking if you arrive early. Seems that there are places and/or roads that close during the winter months (which is to be expected) so make sure to check their website or call prior to visiting if you plan on doing it during the winter time. If you visit in summer time (like I did); bring plenty of water, snacks, sunblock, hats, plus comfy clothes and shoes, (maybe insect repellent as well, I did not have any and I was fine but better to have it just in case).

The car parking is a total joke and not to mention the amount of roadworks blocking up the narrow streets. Try and avoid the village centre.

Sunrises are crazy and sunsets are exquisite. The waterfalls are beautiful but if you go on a holiday or a weekend, it can get pretty crowded. The hotesl are first class and the food runs the gamut from cheap to five star. Staying as the Ahwahnee Hotel is as romantic as it gets, but you have to make a reservation a year in advance. If you have kids, you can take a bus around the valley or take a leisurely stroll. Or if you're in good shape you can hike for miles in every direction. but best of all, you can find a bench adjacent to the Merced River and just stare up at the quiet majesty of El Capitan, Half Dome, Yosemite Falls and other landmarks of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.","February 17, 2017",The most beautiful spot in the United States,14,California,5

Never got in…apparently there was a gravel dump truck accident that closed or partially closed the access road for most of the day. As of 5:00PM on that day it was still taking 2-3 hours just o enter the park. We turned around. We’re told the previous day there was a major accident in the Village involving med flights that also closed the road for a lengthy period of time. Ok, so we were disappointed but those events have no reflection on the value of the Yosemite visit. But…it’s indicative of a weakness in the Yosemite park rangers ability to advise motorists of serious park travel or other safety issues that could make tourists alter there plans. Or at least soften the anxiety of sitting in the likes of a third world country traffic jam for up to 3 hours without any clue as to why. Clearly, the park is fantastic as are the amount of people enjoying it. So be prepared, you won’t be the only one there.

Yosemite Valley,"Just returned from my first winter experience in Yosemite. I've been visiting in Spring and Summer for years. Each season has it's advantages, but Yosemite in Winter is magical. The waterfalls were booming due to the recent storms in California. The meadows and trees were covered with snow. There were wildlife sightings including deer, squirrels and blue jays. No bears, but there were definite warnings about keeping your cars entirely clear of any food, gum, candy or flavored dental floss!

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley includes the best parts of Yosemite National Park. While Yosemite National Park is one of the most crowded parks we've visited during summer months - the peak time for visiting parks of all kinds,Yosemite Valley area is especially more crowded. As we have visited so many different parks in the U.S. (local, state, to national parks), our first impression was that the beauty of Yosemite was over recognized. It is agreeable that each park (national park) has its own beauty. It is no doubt that Yosemite is beautiful. But it is also true that each beholder perceives the beauty differently. Personally, I would rank the beauty/attractiveness (overall scenery, scenic drives, hikes, especially against the crowd level = accessibility) of Yosemite a little below some other national parks with similar geological features that we have visited such as Glacier National Park (Montana) or Rocky Mountains (Colorado). As it is so close to our home, we have explored the park in details for so many times. As of now, after 4 years of frequently visiting the park, we love it more and found it more beautiful each time. Like the old saying, the more you see, the more beauty it gets. No matter what, it is a great place to be for natural lovers. ","February 6, 2017",Great Place To Be!,211,"Fresno, California",5

Yosemite Valley,"If you are lucky enough to ever visit Yosemite, then the valley is definitely the most beautiful part of the park to witness at any time in the year. I would recommend coming up through Fishcamp, this way you get to experience the tunnel entrance and the most iconic views of the valley. The road from the viewpoint descends into the valley where you can get closer views of El Capitan and Yosemite falls. Its worth leaving a day or two to properly explore the bottom of the valley before doing any of the longer or more strenuous hikes. There are many short river and meadow hikes that are filled with amazing scenery as well as the chances of seeing spectacular wildlife. The mist trail is one of the best hikes i have ever done. I would recommend going to the top of Vernall fall and then continue up towards Clark's point. This slight detour allows you to get the views of the fall like the picture in this review. In my opinion, the best views of the valley can be found from Sentinel dome. This short hike offers similar quality views to glacier point but with less crowds.","February 1, 2017",Most dramatic scenery in the world,33,"Wembury, United Kingdom",5

What we really needed for hiking were spikes for our boots. Many people had them and we would have been able to go further with them.

It was hazardous and and dangerous, people were falling all over the place! There were young families with children and babes in arms, there were older people too and I was surprised no one was badly injured while we were there! I saw a lot of people falling, I would have like to see the waterfall from nearer but couldn't risk it as I was the only driver and if I had broken my leg that would have been the end of our holiday! Why can't the rangers put grit down? And so doing save many broken bones and bruises!! They insisted we had chains for the cars, if they are taking such care of the place, use grit!! Or anything else to protect visitors!! At tunnel view there was a lot of ice too, my son fell and hit his head, it could have been serious, luckily it wasn't.

Especially in the morning when parts lying in the shade might be icy!We checked Bridalveil as first stop. Bring some spikes or pull on ice traction for your shoes. The final part to the fall is dangerously slippery!The water spray from the fall creates a thick layer of ice that is both beautiful on the branches of the trees but also creates a layer of ice on the walkway towards the fall.The trail to Yosemite fall was also covered with snow and ice but not that slippery. Besides the fall there where plenty opportunities to shoot some nice pictures.While driving around there were plenty other spot that had there specific beauty.I'll visit the park again after some major snow dump.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is definitely a place that should be on everyone's bucket list. The views, the mountains, the waterfalls, the wildlife, the trees, the history, it's just all impressive. We arrived in the valley at night, and while I could make out the mountains, seeing them in the morning when we got up made me feel like I was still dreaming. How could mountains be this tall?!We stayed for four nights in one of the heated Half Dome Village tents. It was actually quite nice, and stayed warm. We got around to most of the park, the shuttles were really helpful in allowing us to see a lot of the park in our three full days there, as we did not have a car. We saw Vernal Falls by hiking up the mist trail, the next day we did the mirror lake loop, which was spectacular and an easy flat hike! The last day we hiked out to El Capitan. We watched the insane people climbing the mountain, and saw their tents doting the granite. It was very cool, then we swung back around to end the day, and our time at Yosemite at the swinging bridge. A very picturesque spot, with a great view of Yosemite Falls. There were two bridal couples taking photos here. Just gorgeous.I feel that we only scratched the surface of what Yosemite has to offer, but we did see the major sights and cover a lot of ground. There is more to Yosemite than the Valley. The only thing we missed were the Giant Sequoias, but Mariposa grove was closed at the time, and the other groves were not accessible in November without a car. I hope to go back, but if I don't I am happy with how much we accomplished in our three days. Definitely give yourself time to get around and see everything. Spend the money to stay IN the Valley.

Yosemite Valley,Yes this is a top of the line of National Parks. You can see that by the number of local & well traveled tourist each & every year. Think in recent years there is less traffic & more bus & tours. We do remember the good old days.If you have followed us on our 50-State Quest this is one of the rear times we stayed more than once. All were in the month of May because of our anniversary. The first time in 1980 was in the early stages of our quest as the others were in 1984 & 1994 on the cross roads of other states. (note none were in 2016) Once we stayed at Half Dome Village that we really didn't like because they were tents with wooden floors. Guess they would be ok for those people that like that type of outing but not us. Two other times we stayed at Big Trees Lodge for it's great beauty & wonderful food. We only ate dinner so we can't say about other meals but my guess they were just as good too. It's is located in the southern part on your way out of the park before you get to the heart of the valley. Quiet & peaceful just like we like it. Good for picture taking there as well as every place you can find. Waterfalls in so many places & you don't half to walk of climb much. We just have to make one more trip there since our quest is finished not sure when. We didn't say at the Majestic Yosemite Hotel mainly because of the pricing those other years. It is a high end grand hotel that will drop your jaw it has us. Price won't matter the next time.

Yosemite Valley,"I visited the Yosemite NP during the 100. Years Celebration weekend of American National Parks.I was trying to find the Information Point after parking my car far away from the center due to the heavy traffic jam.As there were many rangers standing next to the road during the traffic jam I decided to ask one of them the way to the Visitors Center (it was not clear enough which direction it was). I approached very friendly to a ranger asking the way, as she said something in a very loud voice, which I didnt undestand. As all of a sudden she started yelling at me "" BACK OFF, BACK OFF, RIGHT NOW..!! ""She had a very angry face, was supporting her huge anger with her arms and hands humiliating me in front of others..I had a huge fear that she will definitely injure me physically in case I would not leave.As I continued my walk in the direction where I guessed the Visitors Center is I came to a crossroad where there was a pedestrian walkway as I started to cross through the pedestrial walkways (which was crossing the road) as another ranger started shouting at me ""What do you think you are doing? I tell you when to go and when not to go..!!!""She sounded so angry and full of anger that I stood there with a huge fear ""AGAIN..""""As I was super sad, annoyed, angry etc. I finally managed to find the Visitors Center.I was immediately brought in contact with somebody having a highher position from the rangers who apologized from everything that happened and friendly transferred my words in paper which was added into my complaint form.I have written all my contact data and was promised to be contacted as soon as possible.I was pretty happy from this service as well as the help while filling in the application form.But it is exactly 4 months since the incident. No Mail,No Email, No Phone Call..Not even a single one.During my contact with rangers it was very clear that I am not an American and due to the fact that I have not even been answered about the case I highly suspect that they have not made any single research and have most probably hidden all the fact of the behaviour of the rangers.I have no proof of the behaviours leading to Racism but my outlook, as well as my clearly non-American English accent makes it very clear being non-American. Adding the fact that I have not been contacted at all after waiting for 4 months raised my thoghts of racism.I hope this review could raise awareness about unfriendliness/racism around the rangers in order to improve their behaviour against foreign visitors.Many thanks for reading my review.","December 19, 2016",RACISM in Yosemite National Park,6,,1

Parking was easy everywhere. We spent time chasing the elusive sun in the open fields, picnicking and watching the climbers on El Capitan. The water from Bridalveil Falls into the Merced River is crystal clear. And stop at the Chapel. Just a beautiful setting.I have friends that go in the summer months and I can only image the traffic within the park.There is construction currently within the park and will continue until mid 2017.

Yosemite Valley,"I cannot speak highly enough of Yosemite valley!! If you're thinking of making the trip I can tell you it will definitely be worth it! First off plan ahead as far as accommodations, this place books up crazy fast. I Stayed at Camp Curry (half dome village) and would definitely recommend it, very authentic experience sleeping in amazing fabric tents. I booked in about February for a trip in May and we barely got a tent for one night so book early!! As far as food there is a great area in Camp Curry that has a dining hall with great breakfast and a good spot for pizza at night. It feels like you back at summer camp sitting under the stars talking with strangers you feel like you already knew till long into the night. Be sure to get up early and get out there. There is also a general store with everything you can imagine a full grocery store, great souvenir shop and odds and ends things you might need. The shuttle is a great tool you should be sure to utilize. Make sure to get to mirror lake early in the morning, its a very easy hike, but you'll be amazed at the still-ness and of mirror lake it truly lives up to its name. Yosemite falls is also an amazing site.

It is a big effort for the time we spent at the park but that's about all the time we catered for on a multi city vacation which was a shame. We drove thru the park and only stopped to get out of the car a few times. There were many other features we passed up on to keep moving. But what we saw was breathtaking. I have never seen anything like the size of the valleys, the rock faces, the waterfalls, the park in general. It's a WOW for me. Even for a non hiker, bush walker, I would say a full one day to have a decent look around, then travel outside that. Check that the park is open before you travel out there, as the road was blocked by a rock fall and so closed by park rangers for over 24hrs. Talking to the locals at the road block, that can happen a few times a year.","November 4, 2016",WOW,50,"Hunter Valley, Australia",5

It was only 17 degrees coming over Tioga Pass in the early morning. Plenty see and do on floor. There are a bunch of hiking trails all over the place. This is a great stop in the park.,"October 31, 2016",Really amazing place,49,"Jackson, New Jersey",5
Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is crowded year around especially March through October. If you don't like crowds visit the south or north end of the park. There is an entrance fee. Parking can be a challenge especially on weekends. In winter bring chains as it can snow at anytime. That being said, the valley area is spectacular. There is a visitor center, hotels, campgrounds (thousands of spaces), and a few places to eat. The roadways in the valley are being reconstructed so traffic is slower than usual. If you have a bike bring it as its a good way to get around on the paved roads and paths (bring a lock). No bikes allowed on walking trails. There are bikes are for rent. There are frequent free shuttle buses that circle the entire valley on a frequent basis. The valley is at 4000 feet with most hiking trails starting in the valley and rising several thousand feet. I'm very sensitive to altitude change going from 500 feet to 4000 feet so am prone to headaches and inability to sleep. If you are sensitive don't do any hiking are other strenuous activity the first 2 days. The most popular (crowded) hikes are Vernal Falls and Yosemite Falls. If hiking Vernal Falls and you want to avoid crowds, start before 9am and when at the top of the falls continue another 0.5 miles toward Nevada Falls and take the Clark Trail to the right ( I didn't see a sign saying Clark Trail but it's marked to Muir Trail). This will take you to the Muir Trail, turn right to head back to the valley starting point. Its slightly longer, but a lot faster unless you are a goat. The Vernal trail is very steep with most of it being stairs. The Mirror Lake trail is one of the flatter trails and good for the less serious hikers. View are spectacular. You can continue hiking many miles beyond Mirror Lake if so inclined. There is a restroom at Mirror Lake. Be prepared for wet weather when hiking from fall through spring. Enjoy.","October 31, 2016",Late Fall Visit,28,,5

We wouldn't recommend Mirror Lake in the Summer, it's dried up. Definitely go up to Vernall Falls, very lovely. Worth the hike. Take plenty of water. We managed to fit quite a lot in in one day (and that was not using any of the shuttles). The park is huge, we didn't quite appreciate it until we got there and drove through it.

The next day the weather was foul, the Tioga pass closed, the valley barely visible in the mist from Tunnel View and Half Dome completely invisible from Glacier Point due to cloud and rain (the road to Glacier Point was closed later the same day as conditions worsened). On the upside the rain gave the park a whole new, moody feel, and El Kapitan looming out of the mist was unforgettable.

The Visitor Center has lots of good information and the movies (all of them) are a must to appreciate what you are seeing and what it took for them to be discovered and preserved.

One trip is never enough, and if you wanted to tour this park, you'd need months to do it in a single sitting.There were some wildfires that did destruction, there have been some monsoons.

So its a thillogy trilogy to visit this area. And just North of this park, there's yet another pair of gems less visited: Mono Lake to the East and Redwood Forests and National and State Parks to the West near San Francisco.

We rested and then decided we wanted to climb to the top- Wow then it did get tough! Do not attempt this unless you are reasonably fit and certainly not with young children. I run 10k a week and found it very demanding. You must take lots of water and energy bars or fruit as you will need them, (and maybe a picnic lunch for the top to recover!). The path gets harder the higher you climb with often very deep and very narrow steps and some wet and slippery and as you get more tired can feel quite a challenge. (We were brave but regretted going down the way we came up as there is an easier route worth investigating!! ) But- it is such an achievement and a couple of hours I will never ever forget. We saw a brown bear outside its cave and we then saw a double rainbow bouncing off the waterfall. I am not a particularly spiritual person but this was the first time I have ever felt truly wonderous at how this place came to be. The ticket price is huge value and we could have spent another day or two there. To me a Wonder of the World! ","October 22, 2016",Yosemite - A World Wonder! ,55,"Maidenhead, United Kingdom",5

Yosemite Valley,"This was a bucket list trip we've wanted to do for years. This year we decided to go for it. My wife, grown daughter (not a teenager but that was the only choice offered below) and I stayed in Bass Lake and made the drive every day. It is about a half hour to the south gate, then another hour to the valley. We are from NJ so we try to stay on eastern time, so when we got up at 5 AM, our bodies would think it was 8 AM. That way we arrived at the park 7-730 AM, well before it became too crowded and had some places (like Sentinel Dome) to ourselves for a while. It was very cool.Of course the first stop is the Tunnel View, an overlook of the valley that looks like an Ansel Adams photograph. My wife and I have feet, knee and back issues (our daughter moves like a deer in the woods) but we were still able to do alot. We hiked Mirror Lake, Bridal Veil Falls, Lower Yosemite Falls, Cook's Meadow, Sentinel Beach, McGurk Meadow, the Sentinel Dome/Taft Point Loop (a favorite), Glacier Point and part of Vernal Falls Trail. Some of these were short walks, like Lower Yosemite Falls, while others like Sentinel Dome are almost 5 miles long. Still we were able to walk them all, maybe not quickly but we did it! The scenery is exactly what you expect: towering mountains, rushing rivers and beautiful meadows. There are convenient shuttles to get you around most of the park, even Glacier Point, although that one wasn't advertised much. My suggestion is to go online to get more information about the park. I mostly want to tell you that you can enjoy alot of the park without having to be in terrific physical shape. We loved our time in Yosemite and hope someday to return.","October 19, 2016",Yosemite is all its cracked up to be,160,"Pompton Plains, New Jersey",5
Yosemite Valley,"We stayed outside the park, in a private VRBO property in Mariposa. We drove south from Mariposa to Oakhurst and then up into the park. This was the long way to go, but if you need supplies you can't find in Mariposa Oakhurst would be a good thru-point. We were at the Valley on an autumn Wednesday, midday, and certainly did not expect the bumper-to-bumper slow, creeping traffic. It was rainy, windy, and cold. The vistas were on-and-off fogged in; I have a mobility issue so we could do any trails beyond the vistas. You're in the High Sierra's, so expect twisting, turning roads with many switchbacks and no-railing cliff edges. I absolutely CANNOT imagine driving an RV through this park, especially where there are low tunnels on the road. Plan your bathroom breaks carefully.. Pack a picnic lunch. Pack a cooler full of hydrating beverages. Wear decent shoes; you'll thank me for warning you off sandals or flip flops after your first bathroom break. Warning for those affected by Elevation(Altitude) Sickness - plan your ascent carefully. We had 24 hours at 2500' before moving up into the higher realms; I became suddenly and horribly ill at Glacier Point, at 7200'. We had planned to do Tioga Pass (9000+ feet) the next day, but we took Thursday off to stay at lower elevations so I could better acclimate. The visitor's center was a nightmare for parking and handicap access. Just a few spots, and it's an uphill walk to restrooms, cafe, museum, shops, etc. Some doors on the newer (i.e. not historic) visitors center did not have push-button ADA access; using my rollator was a tough endeavor at this stop. The visitors center would have been a good start, showing scale models of the park, and geological history, but the massive hoards of shrieking, undisciplined school kids made us turn around and leave. I'm sure there are lovely days to be had at Yosemite Village; but I can only imagine they are in the off-off season, and on a weekend. When they decide to make it a no-cars/shuttle-only kind of national park. I cannot fathom how one could enjoy a day here in the summer.","October 19, 2016","Unparalleled Views, Unbelievable Traffic",75,"Beltsville, Maryland",4
Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite’s Valley Floor provides some iconic ops to capture great shots for the gang at home! Below are a few tips to become a Photo Hero!1. Know the right spots to hit. Tunnel View, Valley View, Tahiti Beach (turnoff for two cars…trees inside in parking…just down from Cathedral beach…hike through the woods) and the Sentinel Bridge are my favs. Cooks Meadow is also a great spot to capture some wildlife and the “Yellow Tree” when firing off in the fall.2. Know the right time to hit them: Tunnel View, Valley View and Sentinel are dusk/sunset shots. You can only shoot one each day…set up to be taking photos 30 minutes before sunset and keep firing until about 15-20 minutes after sunset (good chance to get colorful sky after sunset!). Tahiti Beach is a great place to capture pre dawn, sunrise shots of El-Cap (14-16mm lens on full frame body is optimal) and of the Three Brothers. 3. For our advanced shooters: Use a Grad ND filter. It’s an absolute must. I’d go with a 2 stop soft or 3 stop hard Grad filter. And obviously use a tripod. 4. What gets crazy busy…Tunnel View can be the most crowded of the spots…good luck holding your ground.","October 18, 2016",Pro Photographer: Getting great shots in the Yosemite Valley,108,"Arlington Heights, Illinois",5
Yosemite Valley,"Very beautiful place to visit. Yosemite National Park is located 3 hours and a half east of San Francisco. Driving through the park and making a few stops along the way for photos was great. You get to see a lot of the beautiful scenery with small information boards about what you're looking at. Word of advice: If you've never been here or do not have any experience driving on mountains DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT TAKE CA HIGHWAY 120 (aka, New Priest Grade Rd). It consist of steep winding roads. This was a very scary experience for 3 individuals that reside in South Florida. SOME of the curves of guard rails and a lot do not have guard rails. Do yourself a favor and take CA highway140 instead. The roads do still obviously wind a lot, however, it is not as steep.","October 18, 2016",Stunning!,6,"North Miami Beach, Florida",4
Yosemite Valley,"We were on a long driving holiday and Yosemite was to be one of the highlights but somehow felt a little let down by the Valley. When we visited there were extensive roadworks and some nearby forest burning which caused a slight haze. However you cannot take away to amazement of your first sight of the main rock outcrops eg El Capitan. You have to stop and get a clear view - but often find no parking spaces. If you can stop go for a walk away from the traffic and look in peace and quiet at some of natures best. Do not expect to see any waterfalls at the end of a hot summer - we didn't expect and we were not disappointed but strangely many were. Thankfully we came into the National Park via Tioga Pass so could appreciate the high pastures, lakes and mountains from another perspective. When we visit again it will be earlier in the year and with a base as close as we can get it so that early entry is possible.","October 18, 2016",A Busy Valley,139,"Chelmsford, United Kingdom",4

We sat with binoculars for an hour and watched small dots climb up the steep rock face. It takes 3 to 4 days to reach the top. I even got some of the climbers in photos with my big lens. Then we drive into the rest of the valley. Yosemite Falls and Half dome ahead. Biking,fishing, hiking all kinds of activities.Then on to the places to stay. We stayed one night at the Majestic Yosemite Hotel. The original lodge once known as the Awhanee is a historical treat. The rooms are older and small but well appointed. It is rather expensive. We did eat in the main dinning room for dinner. It takes you back to a different time. The entire trip we kept saying how many beautiful things can we remembers.

After doing an all day car shuttle hike from Tioga pass to the Valley floor, we got back to the Valley at 9 pm after fetching our shuttle car. Starved, we went to Curry, Village or whatever they are legally allowed to call it now to get a pizza. Hundreds of people there at 9 pm, line easily 20 deep. We made soup at camp instead and left for the slightly less crowded Tioga Pass high country the next day, a day before our valley camping permit expired. The Valley is beautiful but the crowds make it ugly and competitive--for space, for parking, for food, for expensive groceries. I'd love to return when it is less crowded but not so sure when that might be. Perhaps a Tuesday in December when it's snowing? There are literally millions of people within a three or four hour drive of this park. We goofed by thinking that a September visit would result in fewer crowds. We did much better in terms of hiking, scenery, and far fewer people when we crossed Tioga pass and visited the fabulous wilderness areas of the eastern high sierras outside of the park.","October 10, 2016",Too many people killed the place for us,68,"Majorca, Spain",3
Yosemite Valley,"This was our 5th trip to Yosemite, from awe full to awful, a reversal hopefully attributable to temporary (?) construction work. I had treated extended family to a stay in July of 2011. Yosemite then was, as always, awesome, including the Valley EXCEPT: my relatives hated the congestion and especially the buses so much they vowed never to come back.Of course I disagreed and so, in the ""off"" season I returned with my daughter to prove how awe inspiring Yosemite can be. However, as of our October 2016 entry Yosemite Valley itself was a mess. Temporary signs directed us to ""Visitor Center Parking"", also Yosemite Falls Parking, also Yosemite Village Parking, restrooms and whatnot. Once parked, there was no signage whatsoever to direct us to the Visitor Center nor any sign of a a park ranger. There was a sign to restrooms and information, only the restrooms were port-a-pots, not restrooms, justly earning the disdain of another Tripadvisor reviewer, and no information. We tramped around for over an hour (we are FAST walkers) looking for the visitor center in vain. We decided to drive to the area we had not explored on foot, again finding a temporary sign directing us to another ""Visitor Center Parking"", in a recently cleared dirt lot that was still filled with the debris of felled shrubbery. Again, not any other sign to direct us to any recognizable location. Fortunately, a young man looking for the Falls (in vain) had come across the path to the Visitor Center, through some temporary green netting (devoid of any signage), over a mile away. A mile is not a long hike but by the time we found the Visitor Center, it was closed. We did find a sign for Yosemite Falls there but no indication of mileage, so we left, the afternoon shot - without getting a map of the park or any information about the buses (which is what we were looking for). PS: we did find out later that the Visitor Center bus runs only in the ""summer"". We never did find out where the ""bus"" parking was, so if they want to encourage bus use over car use, this was a failure. PPS: there were orange ""exit"" signs just about every direction we went, just nothing saying exit to where? It felt like they just wanted us out of there.I know the Park Service can do better and hope this is temporary but with the volume of visitors there even in the ""off"" season this lack of direction was inexcusable. I can only imagine how much worse it would be for visitors with no prior experience of the Park. The signage we ultimately found had not been updated with the new placenames though some temporary signs did - adding to the confusion (not retaining the old names is another disgrace) and the maps at the bus stops did not reflect the new detours and re-routings.In short, if you know your way already or can pre-route your way around Yosemite Valley, you can retain the awe; if not, you are more likely to encounter overwhelming frustration.Finally, the absence of a ""friendly"" ranger seemed anomalous. One ranger we encountered later told me he was ""off duty"" when I tried to ask a question. This is so unlike my prior experiences with the Park Rangers that I can only wonder if extreme budget cuts have had such an adverse effect that all Park services are overextended.","October 10, 2016",Losing the awe,49,South Jersey,2

We stayed local the night before so we entered early with very little traffic and we could stop at will. We were in the area for about 1.5 hrs.

We took our time and enjoyed walking many of the trails and at times got ""off the beaten path"". Although it was crowded, we still found the park to be very peaceful. We drove to some of the sites, parked on the side of the road and walked the trails. We then parked our car and took the shuttle to some of the places that are a little harder to get to. Shuttles run quite frequently and are very convenient. Deer and wildlife roam freely - and it is so beautiful when you spot them grazing peacefully in the meadow. There are numerous places to stop to have a picnic or you can grab something to eat at one of the cafes. There are numerous trails - suitable for everyone. Paths are marked ""Easy"", ""Moderate"" & ""Strenuous"". We visited in September, so Yosemite Falls was dry and the rivers & streams were either dry or very low.

Yosemite Valley,"My husband and I, along with friends recently spent four days sightseeing in the Yosemite National Park. I found it difficult to get the answers to my questions via the internet, so I will share some lessons I learned as my review. First we chose to stay in Oakhurst, California, a nice size town 16 miles from the South Entrance to the park. We would have breakfast at our hotel, then go into the park for the day. We would take snacks for a picnic lunch, lots of water to stay hydrated at the high altitudes of the park and would wear comfortable loose fitting clothing, good walking shoes and always have a light jacket. There is bus service into the park from several surrounding areas including the town where we stayed. Once you are in the park.....PARK your vehicle, at one of the many shuttle stops and use the FREE shuttle as your mode of transportation. We found some of the shuttle drivers to be less than helpful with directions, but at each shuttle stop there was a Yosemite Conservancy volunteer, who went out of their way to see that you got to where you were going. There is food available for purchase in Yosemite Village.If you are free to visit at any time, then by all means choose EARLY SPRING before the summer crowds and while the waterfalls and flora are at their peak. Yosemite is one of those wonderful places on earth that must be experienced. Words and pictures cannot do adequate justice to the beauty of this area.","October 1, 2016",OUR NATION'S FIRST NATIONAL PARK,130,"Jellico, TN",5

The other places The Niagara Falls , The Grand Canyon and The Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee. I feel so privileged to have eye sight to see these wonders. I have not visited all America yet, but these were by far the most spectacular that I have seen. Unless another park or place knocks one of these out these will be the best. The Grand Canyon is beyond belief it's so beautiful that I felt like in another planet really. No need to visit Mars. LOl. This is one of those places you have to see before leaving this world. Niagara Falls just breathtaking I could go again and again and never get tired of seeing those spectacular falls. The Smoky Mountains is like living in the clouds one of my favorite places to revisit again and again and fall foliage one of the best of the country.

Rooms are basic but as expected and there are food options at the lodge that match the location. I felt like I was on an family school excursion but in a good way. Yosemite was awesome. We got the bus one way up to Glacier Point and walked the 8 mile panorama trail back. Tours and trips are all booked at the lodge. Tough but glad we did it but with a 9 and 12 year old the 5.5 hour walk was a touch too much and we are an active family. There's a 4 mile option which would have been a smarter move. Still a must see. I reckon if you go hard 2-3 nights is enough but for a keen nature lover longer would be great. We are spending 3 weeks in the states and a trip here is a nice change from the hustle and bustle of many of the other destinations.

Hiked half way up Artists Point which trail begins right off the parking lot. IMO best view of half Dome is at Sentinel Bridge especially for sunset with the rock reflecting off the river. Really nice. Bring your tripod. Valley View is a must with awesome views of El Cap and Cathedral Rock, also reflecting off river. This time of year the water is calm so it's like a mirror. Hiked to Vernal Falls Bridge- not so easy. While the path is paved you are going up about 300 ft in elevation. That's a 30 storey building. Falls were just a trickle but better than Yosemite Falls which were dry as a bone. Glacier Point for sunset is also great but the parking lot can fill up even in the off-season.

There is a mart in the village where supplies can be found. We had planned to go bike riding but, the bike hire site was very hard to find and not very well marked if at all.

We walked up to the top of Vernal Falls and back-drove out to Glacier Point-drove to Tuolumne Grove of giant Sequoias and did the Bridal Veil and Yosemite falls walks (very short and easy). What an amazing place and well worth the visit. We would suggest going when more water is flowing as all of the falls would be active and there would be more of a true sense of the power of this place.

Yosemite Valley,"Yes, all the views are stunning and worthy of life time photos. However, the entire Yosemite National Park experience is now like I-5 Los Angeles Routing Through The Forest. Traffic jam, construction detours, and not a parking spot found unless a car pulls out from one, makes this a very discouraging experience. Have been to many national parks, and this is by far the least user friendly. Signage for location is bare minimal and with the loops and roads, it is very difficult to get a feel for the layout of the land despite the less than detailed maps provided by the Park Service. There has to be a more conducive and positive manner to allow others to enjoy this beauty without the horrendous car jam. Perhaps limiting and or reserving scheduled times. Yes, that certainly limits the American sense of freedom, but there is no freedom and no sense of freedom to in long lines of traffic and congestion. Perhaps something like Zion where the only cars in the park are those with reserved spots for lodging. There has to be a solution that will work for current, and more importantly, future generations.","September 22, 2016",Only the views,38,Scottsdale,4
Yosemite Valley,"I love Yosemite but this visit September 7, 2016 was somewhat disappointing. First of all, we entered by vehicle on Hwy 120 at the west entrance. The lady at the gate just gave us a map and didn't tell us anything. So we stopped at the ranger station to use the restrooms and ask a few questions. The restrooms were very old and basic, and the ranger station was really small and crowded. This appears to be the same building that I walked into on my first visit 40 years ago, and it looks it! At $30 per car and profit from merchandise, etc., not to mention taxes, you would think this main entrance to one of the most visited National Parks would be a little more accommodating! Anyway the park was beautiful as usual though the waterfalls were barely flowing. But the big issue was traffic. We had come on a Wednesday in September hoping to avoid major crowds, but the roads in the valley were under construction and it was difficult and confusing to get around. Then we decided to stop at the Village store but there were cars everywhere and literally no place to park within a mile. We we finally found a fake spot to squeese into and got into the store, we found out that they no longer carried the ""Made it to the Top"" t-shirts or other memorabilia. When I asked at the register the clerk said it was because of trademark rights with the Curry Company I think.

Yosemite Valley,"We visited Yosemite national park for one day and fell in love with it!The park is huge and there are entrances on different sides. We entered the big oak flat west entrance. The highway actually stops at the entrance and you must pay your $30 car entrance fee before you can drive ahead. From this point you can take the tioga pass road and see sights along that route or you can go straight into the valley - this is the main famous attraction! The drive in is stunning and you're going to want to stop and pull over to take photos slightly before you enter the first tunnel. The road hugs the mountain side it's really epic!Once in the valley the easiest thing to do us park up - somewhere near the visitors centre or the Yosemite lodge is good - then use the free shuttle bus which drives in loops around the park - you can get on and off all day - it's free. Find an information stop and they will give you a shuttle bus map - the maps they hand out when you enter don't have this info on there.A great way to get to grips with the whole park is to take the open air ""tram/truck"" ride. It departs from the lodge at 11am and 3pm - try to book ahead - we arrived on the day and got on a reserve list - we just managed to get on. It costs about $25 per person and is well worth it. It wasn't well publicised anywhere in the park - we had just read about it in a book beforehand. The tour guide will tell you lots of interesting info about the park and it drives right round - stopping at tunnel view for you to get off and take photos. It lasts 2 hours. After this you are free to grab lunch, and hop on and off the bus - revisiting any places that sparked your interest.If you want to go walking /hiking a bit of research on which walks you want to do and from where would be helpful before you go! You won't be dissapinted it is stunningly beautiful. Top tip - be prepared to be part of a tourist melee- and let it wash over you - don't let it detract from the natural beauty you are seeing. Enjoy!Ps. No one told us that in September there are NO WATERFALLS! It was still amazing - but visiting in May/ June / July would be a different experience with all the beautiful falls!

Yosemite Valley,"We visited and camped in Yosemite two weeks after Labor Day, attempting to avoid a small bit of the gridlock of summer. I think we achieved that, to some degree, although it was still quite crowded. We were unfortunate to arrive at Yosemite Valley on the same day as they had planned a prescribed burn immediately between the Village and Half Dome. There were times that the smoke was so dense, we couldn't even see El Capitan, even though the weather was clear and beautiful. However, the wind did shift later in early afternoon, so the day wasn't completely ruined. Since we were camping in the park, I do not know if they were informing people arriving about the burn, but had we known, we might have chosen a different area of Yosemite to visit that day. And, therein, lied part of the problem with our trip there. Communication of important information seems to be lacking in the Park.Additionally, the shuttle system route had apparently been changed after Labor Day, but had we not stumbled upon a volunteer worker in the visitor center sitting off to one side, we might not have known about the route changes and ended up wasting much valuable time trying to navigate the newly changed shuttle routes. There was no apparent notices that communicated these changes.But, Yosemite is truly the gem that you've heard about and still worth the visit. And, other than the prescribed burn, mid-September seems to be an ideal time to visit.","September 20, 2016","Unbelievable scenery, but logistical nightmare",25,"Denver, Colorado",4

Yosemite Valley,"We arrived around 10 AM on a weekday after Labor Day. We asked the ranger at the gate where the best parking was and his response was ""wherever you can find it."" We soon learned that this basically meant there wasn't any. Finally after driving around for 45 minutes we found a space at the far end of the park. Fortunately this was near the trail head for the first trail we wanted to hike. Then the second issue cropped up - what was the name of the location we were parked at and how did that relate to where we wanted to go? There is currently a lawsuit between the National Park Service and the accommodations manager for the park about the names of facilities. This has been going on for several years so the park maps are a mess - some with the ""traditional"" facility names and some with the names that the vendor insists should be used. Finally we decided to go to a shuttle bus stop and ask how to get to our destination. I must say that the bus drivers are all extremely patient and helpful and will get you to the correct destination.I understand that this is an extremely popular destination. That said, there needs to be a much better system to keep as many cars out of the valley floor as possible. It's just not acceptable to have to drive around for 45 minutes just to find a parking space. The management at Yosemite needs to look no further than one of their sister parks - Glacier - to see a much better model which encourages everyone to park at the edge of the park and take shuttles into the park. We've related our tale to other Yosemite visitors who have confirmed that our experience was not an anomaly. Those who were there in high season said it was actually worse - basically complete traffic gridlock. And that's not why anyone visits a national park.","September 19, 2016",Scenery - Magnificent!

Yosemite Valley,"I've been looking forward to coming here for years and fully intended staying for a few days in the valley and go hiking. We met up with some friends from Berkley and soon found out that the valley is tourist hell. So if you are going to visit, avoid the valley, we stayed in some amazing A Frame Cabins just outside the park in the hills by Oakhurst, (search Far Meadow Yosemite) they are very secluded and let you really experience the park in comfort.Again for hiking I would avoid the valley, for views of El Capitan and the Half Dome head up the glacier point road and park up next to McGurk Meadow trail and follow the trail for 5 miles for the most amazing view across the valley (picture attached) It's a 10 mile round hike but moderate effort and only 500 feet of elevation. We met 10 people in total over 5 hours walking !!!If you are up for something more strenuous then head to the Wawona visitors centre for a 8.2 mile round trip to the Chilnaulna Falls, it's a hard climb but well worth it for the view at the end (plus an ice cold pool to dip your sore feet into at the top)We were lucky and avoided the crowds, some people were sat in their cars for 90mins just to drive to the top of glacier point road for a view, it looked like a traffic jam Just remember don't tell too many people how great these trails are :0)","September 19, 2016",You have to visit Yosemite just avoid the crowds in the valley,11,"Lichfield, United Kingdom",5

Map they handed out was incorrect. Called Half Dome Village, Curry Village on the map. Other mistakes too. Checked out two camp grounds. Horrible. Roads hardly passable and we were in a jeep. Dirt and dust everywhere. Bathrooms dirty and toilets plugged up with plungers sitting in them. Bees thick in campgrounds. We will NEVER go back to Yosemite again.

We approached the park from Sonora and after about an hour or so were completely overawed with the scenery.We went on a 2 hour valley bottom tour which was really good as the young Ranger Christine narrating was very enthusiastic but had I think a New York accent which was hard to follow, but she was very knowledgeable and made the trip fun as well as educational.","September 17, 2016",What can you say!!!,157,"Peterborough, United Kingdom",5

There are plenty of walks to do, but unfortunately they are difficult due to the lack of signage and the trails are just crumbling messes. There is also a lack of eateries, and the convenience stores are over priced. I expected a lot from the park as the national parks service is all for protecting the area but it all seemed to be just talk.

There is also a great star gazing tour at night- not to be missed. The Majestic Lodge is great to hang out for lunch, afternoon tea or just to relax.

Yosemite Village being the most significant with restaurants, cafes, shops and a post office. There are a variety of trails that can be followed but on some the incline can be a little off putting.

Yosemite Valley,"Greatly enjoyed the park and highly recommend to visit. However, it seemed to be run less efficiently that over 30 other NPs we have visited. Recommend that Park Service consider moving huge ""employee"" parking areas elsewhere (and using shuttles) to open up more accessible parking space for ""tourists"" and also have better signage, especially when roads are under major construction (this week) when many of the roads were closed but there were NO revised signage on how to get to Visitor Center, what should be a simple task. Might also be nice to post advance notice as to when burning meadows will be done as it would help in planning visits (on our trip this week there were no possible views of Half Dome from the valley floor for almost three hours as a burn was being conducted on adjacent meadows). Majestic Hotel staff said they only got notice an hour before the extremely heavy smoke began. Come on Park Service....expected better!

While the views were fantastic we were really happy that we could get up real close to the water falls. We got all wet but exceedingly happy. The shuttle around the park was very efficient and a better way to move around the Valley in view of the traffic congestion and few parking spaces in some of the locations.

From lakes to rivers and the mind blowing mountain scenery we would have been disappointed had we come in from the West and missed the brilliance away from the tourist centre.Hire a car and explore. You will love it!,"August 31, 2016",Maginificent scenery from Mammoth Lakes to El Portol,14,"Mornington Peninsula, Australia",5
Yosemite Valley,"One of the most beautiful national parks. The views in the valley are amazing. The best way to see it all is to rent a bike in the park and avoid all the traffic. We road a 12-13 mile loop around the valley floor stopping to take hikes and swim in the river. Don't miss the hike to El Capitan. Stop anytime you see the river, plop the bikes down and take a dip. You will zip everyone sitting in their cars in traffic!","August 31, 2016",So many amazing views and hikes -- rent a bike to avoid traffic and see it all!,11,New Jersey,5

There is no trash along roads! People really seem to value and care for this place in ways that they want to actually keep things clean, it's a very special place. This park, particularly the valley, will take your breath away! I highly recommend the star gazing show at Glacier point at 9pm!","August 30, 2016",Fantastic!,8,"Saint Charles, Missouri",5

Yosemite Valley,Definitely not to be missed especially if you plan or already have been to Glacier Point. You will get the full view by being at both levels.

Yosemite Valley,"The village is filled with too many people. Not what I expected from Yosemite. It's filled with restaurants, a store, and information centers, for the campers. Away from the village is much quieter and beautiful. We walked a few shorter hikes to the falls, but they were dry.","August 30, 2016",Too many people...too many cars.,25,"Seekonk, Massachusetts",3
Yosemite Valley,"Arriving early is a must to get a spot to park, as the Valley gets extremely busy. The facilities at the Village are good such as the visitor centre and the paths are well maintained. Everywhere you look you are presented with extraordinary views of the geography of this rather unique place. We got caught in traffic as we tried to leave the Park on a Sunday evening just as the campgrounds were emptying. It is a must-see place to visit, which makes me feel a little hypocritical complaining about the sheer volume of visitors, but one does feel that the very popularity of the Valley may eventually destroy what is so beautiful about it.","August 29, 2016","A place of stunning natural beauty, marred slightly by it's popularity.",8,"Burnley, United Kingdom",4
Yosemite Valley,It is so unfortunate that this beautiful part of the world was over run with people on the Friday that we were there - I hate to think what it is like on a weekend. We luckily managed to get parking and took a shuttle bus around (you have to). The bus was standing room only and therefore very unpleasant. There must be a better way - a restriction on the number of people allowed in each day perhaps? The sights are stunning and we had a much better experience when we left the valley to drive the Tioga road - also stunning.,"August 28, 2016",Too many people,45,"Oakville, Canada",4
Yosemite Valley,Yosemite Valley is a must if you have time. You can see most of the sights in a day if you catch the free bus that goes round Yosemite and get of at the sights. Most of the hikes to the views are quite short and not too strenuous. The car parks get full very quickly so get there early. ,"August 28, 2016",Stunning,34,"Horsham, United Kingdom",5
Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite is a beautiful place to visit. We went on several hikes during our visit, but even driving around there is a lot of pretty scenery. If you're looking for waterfalls, don't go in August. Bridalveil was barely flowing and Yosemite Falls didn't have any water. The only 2 falls we saw were Vernal and Nevada which were nice.

With tones of view points the entire valley is riddled with gorgeous views.Although some Europeans may be first surprised by the meaning of the American definition of 'Hike' or 'strenuous walk' as these phrases seemed to consist of Tarmac slopes venturing up a mountain with regular stops for sinks to top up drinking water and lively toilets.

By late morning the trailhead parking lots are so full the Rangers close the roads so you can't get out of the car. We made the mistake of trying to find a spot around lunch time and had to give up after searching over an hour. Pretty frustrating. But, it is what it is and I understand the park wants income. That aside, the scenery, the domes... Wow. Breathtaking nature and utterly beautiful. Very happy we went, just a little disappointed we couldn't do more hiking.

Yosemite Valley,"It is inevitable that the Yosemite Valley is so busy, as it is the epicentre of the whole park. You must go in order to see El Capitan and the waterfalls close up, even though Glacier Peak gives a better overall panorama. It would be tempting to suggest more facilities such as eateries and shops, but this would focus the visitors even more into one spot. The place was very busy in late August, but not so much that there were traffic queues everywhere - it was just hard finding parking spots.The shuttle bus, although we didn't use it, was a good idea for getting from one attraction to another, and would suit those without their own transport around the whole park, or maybe for a group where members wanted to go different ways for the day.If returning I would go out of high season and enjoy the very easy walks with fewer visitors, and maybe more water in the waterfalls, rivers and Mirror Lake, which was dry!","August 27, 2016",Majestic park,132,"Marlborough, United Kingdom",5

You can get off the bus and get on another bus later. It permitted us to walk some of the trails, have lunch by a stream, and see some wildlife. It was nice to just ride and take in the mountain views. There were many places for taking photos. There is a museum and other places to visit as well as a large gift/grocery store where we stopped. Can’t pass gift shops with grandkids along. They have a ton of gifts and souvenirs to choose from as well as a grocery items.

Yosemite Valley,We spent three nights in the park and it was better than advertised. First night at the Ahwahnee now Majestic Hotel and two nights at Scenic Wonders near the. Fresno exit. Both were fine with the Ahwahnee a bit dated but a classic building. Dinner at the Awahnee was excellent and about the only real good food in the Valley. First day we got acquainted with the Valley. The second day we took a bus to Tulimere Meadow. 2 HR ride each way but it gave a good way to see the park. Super walk in the meadow where we came across 10 bucks resting in the shade about 30 feet away from the path. Last day were a few short hikes off the valley bus shuttle followed by the best part of Yosemite the view from glacier point. SPECTACULAR.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is one of the most photographed places in the world and we now know why. It is absolutely breathtaking to stand in the field in between these colossal mountains of granite.We drove in to Yosemite from the nearby Groveland area and it was a short 30-45 minute ride from the park entrance into the Valley. It was an incredible drive along the edge of the mountains and a joy to take in the views. The drive, like many in the area, are not for the faint of heart as the drop offs can be quite steep. As you approach the valley, half-dome is visible from a magnificent viewpoint along the ride.Yosemite Valley is great for day-trippers (like us) and campers and hikers and all outdoors folk. We drove in to take in the sights for a few hours. There are many places to pull off and take great photos. In the heart of the valley, there are many things going on. They have a museum and other places to visit as well as a large gift/grocery store where we did stop. They have a ton of gifts and souvenirs to choose from as well as a good grocery selection and wines, beer and liquor. The prices were fairly reasonable. Many of the grocery items are perfect for picnicking in the valley. Continuing on the loop from the store, brings you past El Capitan and into a wonderful grassy area in the valley that is a perfect back drop for photos. We passed many camping sites along the way as well as many places to picnic. Getting around the valley was easy as they have 2 lane roads and there were not that many cars or buses, considering we were there in summer.While we briefly visited Yosemite to take in the sights, we absolutely want to go back one day and spend a lot more time there. It’s an absolutely beautiful park to visit.","August 25, 2016",Simply Beautiful!!,102,familythattravels30,5

Yosemite Valley,"It had been many years since I had been to Yosemite. We were 2 couples on a month long vacation from Oklahoma City to the Oregon Coast, down the Oregon/CA coast, Lake Tahoe, Yosemite, Sequoia, and then home. We were camping the whole trip. Yosemite is just as beautiful and grandiose as I remember. The Valley has to be one of the most beautiful places there is. It was hot while we there with temps in the high 90s. While there we took the 2 hour open trailer tour of the valley which was great and very informative. If your time is limited, this is a good trip. If you have more time, I would consider the 4 hour tour. We camped in Coarsegold, CA in a KOA and rode a bus into the Park. This turned out to be a good approach and I might recommend it if you camp out in that area. You avoid having to deal with traffic which was pretty heavy when we were there. There are free shuttles in the Park. We plan to come back in a couple of years for a longer stay and not during the summer. The falls dry up in the summer. During the spring when the snow melt is at the peak the amount of water over the falls is much greater. Also the number of people in the Park is less. If you are in this area, this is a must see. It is very highly recommended.","August 23, 2016",A Must See,72,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",5

We'd seen the pictures- everyone has- but it was absolutely, stunningly beautiful. You go through that tunnel and you just can't believe the view when you emerge- incredible. We spent two days there in perfect weather and we'll probably go back. We did the short hikes down to see the giant Sequoias (saw a bear on the way back up) and they were awesome- well worth the short hike. We also hiked up to Sentinel Dome, which provides spectacular views of half dome, waterfalls, and other peaks. To really see Yosemite you should really take some short hikes- but if that's not a possibility then drive down to the Yosemite Valley, where you can take some free bus tours and still see spectacular sights- and drive out to Glacier Point- where you'll get unbelievable views with just a very short walk.

I recommend stopping at the visitor's center to get maps and plot our your route with one of the well informed and helpful park rangers.

It only runs three nights a month but if you happen to be there at the right time we can highly recommend this. It is a two hour trip on an open topped trailer with a stop for hot chocolate half way. The ranger who led our trip - Kate - was simply wonderful as a guide to the Valley. We also did the trek to Vernal falls which is tough but manageable with children (ours are 12 and 13) and offers spectacular waterfall views even towards the end of summer when the water levels are low.

Cars were parked everywhere and anywhere. Traffic tie-ups at every stop sign. We couldn't wait to get out of there.We spent most all of our 3 days outside the valley, glad I planned it this way. We did have to come back to the valley to ride the one way bus to Glacier Point. When completing the Panorama Trail hike, we took a shuttle from the end of Mist Trail to Yosemite Lodge. People were packed into the bus like sardines. The bus made at least 10 stops on the way and on every stop we saw hoards of people everywhere.Don't get me wrong, the valley is a beautiful place. We just don't enjoy enormous crowds like this when visiting our national parks. These observations were mid-week in August, not on a weekend.","August 15, 2016",Way too crowded with cars and people,537,"Newtown, PA",3
Yosemite Valley,"This was our 4th visit to Yosemite and the most disappointing. Our last visit occurred in 2003 and we had friends with us from Japan. It was a great trip and the waterfalls were spectacular. Our Japanese friends really enjoyed the beauty of the park. We drove to the various sites and walked at our leisure. We have many fond memories and videos of that trip.So, we encouraged our adult son, who was visiting from Texas, to go with us to visit Yosemite again. Boy, did we ruin his vacation. The park was crowded with tourists. You had to use the bus to get from site to site as there were traffic jams on the roads. And on the bus there was standing room only. Reminded me of taking the bus to work in downtown L.A. The weather was hot and as it was summer, the waterfalls had dried up. The only 2 waterfalls still with water required a mile uphill walk. And I mean uphill. My son and I made it but I will never do it again.Will we go back again? If we do, it will be early in spring to see the waterfalls and perhaps to beat the crowds. Also, the motels will be less crowded and easier to book. It's still a beautiful place but in the summer, it's too hot and too crowded.","August 14, 2016","Too Hot, Too Crowded, Too Bad",50,"Rancho Cucamonga, California",3

We would recommend the following:- glacier point walk - especially the dome walk at the top and Taft point - Mirror lake walk and the valley - driving the loop in the valley around the main village- walking around the sequoia trees, north of the main valleyEntering the park costs $30 by car. We would recommend getting in early to make it easy to park (pre-10:30am). There is a massive drought at the moment so a lot of the forrest looks very tired and dry. We heard 80% of certain tree species have died this season due to disease and drought. Another sign of global warming. :(Highly recommend coming here. P.s.

Many tourists like us do not venture past the main attractions, and as a result there are a bit more people that I would have liked in a nature park.

Yosemite Valley,"This was an incredible day and we started with the hike / rock climb to lower Yosemite Falls. Once we made it there we took a plunge in the refreshing reservoir below the falls. What an amazing spectacle to see the sparkle and glimmer of the granite through water droplets. Such a contrast to the dry dusty granite boulders en route. My 4 year old made the hike with us, 3 teens and my wife, the teens were already swimming in the cool water by the time we arrived. Next, after a bite to eat in the Cantina (very reasonably priced and delicious), we drove up to Glacier Poiint where the views are extraordinary. This was the extent of our one day excursion however we cannot wait to re visit Yosemite and stay for several days for more nature, fresh air, hiking and rock climbing.

Yosemite Valley,"I traveled from San Francisco to Yosemite ...a 4 hour drive one way...on a 40-person bus operated by Extranomical Tours of San Francisco. The bus has no bathroom; however, a 20-minute rest stop half-way through the trip is included. The bus was comfortable in the morning before the heat of the day set in. Bus was very hot all afternoon and the 4 hour return to SF. Do not sit at the back of the bus...very rough riding and crowded to say nothing of hot. Gino, our expedition leader, is a careful driver and very accommodating. Yosemite is majestic and worth seeing, even riding 8 hours to go there and back. VERY crowded in summer. The tour spends about 4 hours in various areas of the park, allowing for walks, picture taking, etc. TAKE WATER. Temp was 103 degrees day I was there. Comfortable shoes a must. If you don't take a tour to the park, driving is another choice though parking is an issue in tourist season. The Yosemite Valley Lodge is in the midst of the park and has very adequate dining options. Being such a short time in the park is a downside to really getting the feel of the park and leisurely exploring. Consider cost of tour vs the 8-hour rather dull ride. I did not stay overnight at Yosemite Valley Lodge, just toured it during a lunch stop there......actually at the Aramark cafeteria next door, run for the Park Service.","August 10, 2016",At the Bottom of Yosemite Valley,3,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5
Yosemite Valley,"What we learned from our visit - 1. Take the shuttles! No sense in fighting traffic, and the shuttles provide a nice way to sit and enjoy the Valley sights in comfort. The main valley shuttles come to each spot about every five minutes, so you never have to wait long.2. There is a parking lot across from Camp 4, and it was almost completely empty when we showed up on a Thursday afternoon (about 2:00). When we got to the Half Dome Village parking lot on Wednesday at about 9, it was mostly full, so I would highly recommend the Camp 4 parking lot. The road makes a loop around the Valley, so it is a one-way road, and this parking lot is actually on the way out of the Valley, so you should be able to get out faster as well. You can pick up both the main Valley shuttle and the El Capitan shuttle from this lot. One con though - this is said to be a high bear area. We didn't have any trouble, but just something to know.3. If you aren't staying in the Valley, get there early! If you get there at eight or nine, you will hopefully miss most of the traffic and get in a couple hikes before the crowds arrive. One ranger said their busiest hours are 10 to 3.","August 10, 2016",What we learned from our visit,5,Mantorville,5

Shuttle service is ok but plan on walking as buses are often full. General store and deli Options are good value. Get reservations for Awahanee hotel in advance. Gas up outside of park, it's about $1 per gallon more. To get away from crowds, try Wawona, Tioga Road, and Hetch-Hetchy.

Stunning views of Half Dome, El Capitan and other landmarks can be seen here. Using the Yosemite Area Regional Transportation (YART) is highly recommended. It is free and reliable, every 10 to 15 min. They could be crowded but it is better than looking for parking. There is a bus that will take you to El Capitan from the visitor center. There is open air transportation on a wagon pulled by a semi. This kind of transportation carry water jugs in places where water is not available. Really important on a hot summer day. The museums and the Ansel Adams Gallery are air conditioned. The tables outside the visitor center are nice . Be aware of the wild animals. They are not afraid of people and could steal your food .

Yosemite Valley,"I already knew it was going to be hot weather and crowded, so it didn't surprise me that traffic was quite thick when we arrived late afternoon. We had a night in the Lower Pines campground, which was very tidy and organized. In the morning we just walked around the valley a bit and took the Valley Floor Tour. I'd recommend it for a first time visitor, good information about the history of Yosemite and the natural wonders you'd see. The Tour tram is completely open so if you're remotely sun- or heat- sensitive I'd recommend a lot of water, SPF clothing or sunscreen and a hat. It's a 2 hour tour, it gets a bit toasty in the sun.We stayed outside the park for 2 other nights. The next day, on the way into the park we did the little Bridalveil falls trail. Short, paved, and shaded though inclined. We had a 7 y/o and two 5 y/o's in our group and they had no trouble.We played by the water by the ""swinging bridge."" It was shallow and the current not too strong, but I imagine it could be very different other parts of the year.The Happy Isles Nature center was fun as well. The Awahnee (Majestic) hotel is pretty.Tips:1. Get into the park early (9-10 am or earlier), park your car and use the shuttles to get around. The shuttles are frequent and bypass the traffic so you can get around much quicker than driving.2. Cafeteria near Yosemite Lodge is affordable and convenient. 3. The NPS has a program where any 4th grader (and their carload) can get a pass to the park ""EveryKidinaPark.gov"" Ours were too young, but it would be worth it.4. Check the weather. If it's hot: hydrate, hydrate, hydrate.5. Make friends, there's people from all over the world.Little kid tips:- Many paths are paved, so you could take a stroller, but it's a bit cumbersome, especially on the shuttle buses.- Bring snacks and drinks. - There are a lot of bathrooms, but a lot of the ones at trailheads are pit toilets, so a bit stinky. Those ones do not have sinks, so bring your wipes or hand sanitizers.- There's ice cream at the gift shop and cafeteria, when you need to give them incentive to ""hike.""- Bring some water shoes.

The Village Store is convineint if you are camping or staying in condo as they have food and camping necessities. There are places to eat, although we chose to cook our own or make sandwiches for our hikes. We visited the Ahwahnee Hotel, just to say we did, but found it as awesome as we had heard. It's worth the stop to check out the main room, dining hall and grounds. The Ansel Adams Gallery is also worth a stop to see his iconic photos of everything Yosemite. If you have time, sign up for the free 1-hour photo walk to hear about his life and get great pointers on shooting better pictures. The best part about the valley is the trailheads and we parked somewhere in the valley everyday to start a new adventure. Even if you don't hike to the top of Yosemite Fall, the walk to the trailheads for the upper or lower fall are lovely. The worst part of the valley is the traffic. It gets so bad in the afternoons you may find yourself sitting for 20 minutes or more without moving! We got to our destination early each morning to ensure we had a parking spot and avoided the gridlock.

After a short nap I found the parking area (and just be warned - even though you get to the park, there is still a very long drive to get into the valley itself - be sure to get gas before you get too close because they will gouge you with the only gas station charging $1.00 more per gallon) and started my exploration. Since it was so early and fairly quiet I saw some deer before the crowds arrived.The falls are spectacular and I was told that I was lucky that they still were early in July because there had actually been a good amount of snow the previous winter - there are some years when it's barely a trickle by July.Then I was off on a long hike - most of the time alone - occasionally seeing others - on the Valley Loop Trail. It does intersect one of the campgrounds where there was a VERY long line of people registering - I didn't camp but be warned that on a busy summer weekend you'll have a VERY long wait.It's mostly flat - some parts are a little boring - but then you'll come across a giant boulder that somehow rolled down from the mountain hundreds of years ago with trees growing all around it now. Or a beautiful little stream cascading over the rocks. Just be sure to wear comfortable shoes and take water because there's nothing around most of the time.Then as you circle back, be sure to take a little detour to BridalVeil Falls - not very big but really pretty. All of Yosemite is quite wonderful so take your time and explore and just breathe in the awesome beauty and be glad that the ""tree huggers"" of 100 years ago thought ahead to preserve this place for us to experience","July 30, 2016",A Must See,89,"Royal Oak, Michigan",5
Yosemite Valley,This place takes your breathe away. It is not as extensive as I thought it would be just the one awesome valley but none the less a must see. We stayed in the basic half moon village which was absolutely fine. I would recommend the valley floor tour which does what it says and takes you on a tour of the valley on the act of a trailer giving you great opportunities for photographs without crashing your car. It is also led by a ranger who gives great information.,"July 29, 2016",Stunning ,58,"Dunblane, United Kingdom",5

Yosemite Valley,"So the Valley is were most of the visitors with families (ie children and older adults) and their cars congregate. Of course there will be traffic. Imagine hot weather, lots of waiting and possibly difficulty with trying to find parking.With that said, plan ahead. and so I did. I have read all the other reviews and it did say traffic and difficulty with parking. This is what I did:1. before I even arrived in CA. I printed the information I needed, like phone numbers and directions to the place I wanted to visit. I looked at the map and avoided going to the valley on the weekend and reserved Valley points until the weekday. 2. I arrived earlier than usual to avoid the crowd. 10 am is NOT early, as most of the families are already in the park. 9 am on a weeday is pushing it. 8am is doable. 3. allow for allowance in travel time. Tioga Pass to the valley took us 45 minutes4. Be ready with plan B just in case you can't go to your plan A. We wanted to go to Horsetail Falls but could not because our child was really tired from the heat, so we went to Lower Yosemite falls instead. 5. It's hot, so I froze several bottles of water and each family member got one. as the hours pass i drank from it and supplemented it with non frozen water. It was refreshing especially on those hot days.6. I rode the shuttle, we parked the car on one one of the camp sites and took the shuttle to several Valley stops. 7. I did not pack the day with lots of points to visit. Mostly I planned 2 pints to visit and at the end when I still have time, we went to the store to get some essentials. Preparation is key, especially when you have a child in tow. You have to be flexible too.

Yosemite Valley,I was encourage to do a tour of Yosemite while visiting SF. I turned 50 this year and I'm starting to realize the need to take advantage of every opportunity so I decided to complete the 16 hour journey. Our tour driver was knowledgeable but a little aggressive (blowing horns). I know it is a hard job keeping on schedule but he encouraged us not to walk down hill to see big Sequoia tree because may be late getting back to bus. Only half people did this. I'm not rating this driver/company. I'm glad that I saw the beauty of Yosemite (check off my list) and encourage people to visit. I suggest that you do it while you are young.

Yosemite Valley,"It is so hard to write this, but going to do it anyway. This is my second time to visit Yosemite. The last time was many years ago. That experience was fantastic. This trip was disappointing. Both my husband and I felt that way. The beauty of the valley is still breath taking. The problem is the number of people. This felt like a ""drive by"" tour as you could not stop at any of the major attractions. NO PARKING-PERIOD. It is recommended that you ""park"" and ride the shuttle around. Well, if that is what is expected, then provide ""parking"" or limit the number of vehicles allowed in the park. I suppose I wouldn't feel this way if I had not been here before. The falls, half dome, el cap are awe inspiring. The traffic is deflating. We literally drove in, drove in a loop in the valley and drove out. The saving grace was Hetch Hetchy. We stopped there first. The falls, the dam and the trail there are beautiful. So glad it was accessible. The park, not so much.The next day we had to drive back into the park to get to our next destination. Driving 140 over the Tioga pass was amazing. So glad this route was available. Seeing half dome from the ""back"" was really something. No where near as crowded and some of the most beautiful sites on the route. Tenaya lake was clear, clean and amazing. Stopped there for a snack and walk. Tuolumne Meadows was very pretty as well. Very happy we took this route. So much to see, and snow still on the side of the road.

Absolutely wondrous scenery that we will not experience anywhere else.Waterfalls on either side. Towering domes. Neat trails. Just so cool.As much as I wanted to, I just could not bring myself to give this Valley any less than 5/5 because in of itself it's nothing short of perfect. But the simple fact is that they let too many people in at one time. Thus, traffic galore. It would benefit the park and its visitors greatly if they would cap the amount of people allowed in the Valley. But alas. It's just so crowded. And we were there on a Monday! The crowds meant that finding a place to pull off for pictures was almost impossible. And the crowds meant that perusing the Village store (and other village areas) was almost unbearable and certainly unenjoyable.Unfortunately I felt the village itself was a bit underwhelming, but probably mainly because I couldn't see it through all the people.That all being said, I would come here again in a heartbeat.

One thing to know is that Yosemite is a HUGE tourist destination - especially in the summer. You should definitely be aware that parking is hard to find and there are people EVERYWHERE. We started our tour of the valley towards mid-afternoon and that was a BAD idea. There were cars and people everywhere, not to mention a huge traffic jam that seemed to start at 3 p.m. and was still present around 7 p.m. So, be prepared to be a ""parking shark"" if you bring your own car..it was not easy, and it was definitely a hike from most spaces, since if you give up your spot, you can consider it gone for the remainder of the day.

We sat in very slow moving traffic for 2 hours queuing to get into Yosemite Village. When we finally arrived, we drove around and around for 30 minutes trying to find a car parking space. There wasn't one, so came out again without stopping. Very frustrating! Did stop on the way out at the base of El Capitain which was great. The problem is that most of the attractions are located in one area so visitors are not spread out through the park as much as Sequoia. Glacier Point - queued for an hour for a shuttle bus as the car park was full. In the heat with kids and pregnant women with no shade with just one bus going backwards and forwards. No staff for information, but a helpful young man from a convenience store came over and advised that he thought we had at least another hour's wait from the point we were at. We left without seeing Glacier Point. Advice is to go early, get parked in Yosemite Village first and experience those views. Then come out to Bridalveil Falls, Glacier Point and Tunnel View. Altnatively, if you only have time for one National Park - definitely go to Sequoia as its a far better day out. Yosemite views are amazing and natural beauty unsurpassed and its reputation is well deserved.

The vehicle had huge windows to make sure we didn't miss anything. The drive to the park had spectacular views. The park is huge and too much to explore in 3 hours but we did manage a 5 km hike, had lunch and a quick swim before rejoining our tour operator at the appointed meeting place. There is a wide selection of food available at the food court at Yosemite Valley Lodge. It was very busy the day we went and was 95 degrees. This tour is suitable for those wanting a taste of the Sierra Nevada Foothills. ","July 20, 2016",1 day trip,1,,4

Hiking the Valley loop is nice, however: not at any moment did I feel surrounded by nature. There is always cars either in site or you hear the roar, there buildings everywhere, and of course: loads of people... To European standards the are suprisingly little bars (none), restaurants or terraces (none) in an area that is so massively visited.Bear in mind that every hike that takes you from the valley up will soon be a disaster for people with a fear of hights like myself. Many trails run against steep rock walls, and have no fencing at all.

We stayed in Mariposa, though not far, made it so we had to have set plans for each day in order to accomplish what we wanted to most. We actually did all we wanted in 2 days, but would've done more if we had stayed in the park. We did Bridal Veil, Vernal, and Lower Yosemite Falls; we also hiked to Mirror Lake and looked around the visitor center. Doesn't sound like a lot, but if you're walking, it takes some time, and if you're driving from outside of the park, that itself is 2 hours roundtrip.

Highly recommend the scenic drive into the valley on Big Oak Flat Road, but if winding roads w/sharp drops aren't your thing, then following the river in via El Portal will get you into the Valley's treasures just fine. Cannot stress enough how CROWDED the park got on the Sunday we visited, so plan to arrive early or later before sunset to avoid some of the rush, and have a little patience if you're driving your own vehicle in - it's all worth it, but sometimes the tourists get a little cranky looking for a place to park. Driving around the other side of the loop yielded better parking options than everyone who was trying to park at the first available spot once you enter the valley. We also drove out via Tioga Pass, highly recommend if you have the time in summer when the road is open, beautiful scenery in it's own right and some great lakes to stop and enjoy on your way out of Yosemite.","July 20, 2016",Beautiful - and crowded!,1,,5
Yosemite Valley,"We intended to spend just a day at Yosemite to see the various highlights of the park, including the valley. The park was incredibly busy as it was a Saturday in summer, and we queued at various of the stopping off points, queued to find a spot in the car parks, queued to rejoin the traffic, queued when one road joined another, queued when two lanes became one, and spent an hour travelling about one mile. We turned off before the one-way loop round the valley as it was clear we would spend another few hours sitting in traffic. While I appreciate that many people want to visit the park and that driving is supposedly discouraged, the park must do more to manage this situation. It might be an idea to ban all cars from the valley on busy days; it would be useful to have some electronic signage around alerting visitors to the busy parts and likely waits (since there is no mobile signal), and more patrolling of the vehicles in the park would also be helpful (many cars were using and then clogging up the bus lane). It is a truly beautiful spot and I wish we had been able to visit it more easily.

We have arrived to the gate before 10 am, waited at the gate for around an hour and then were not able to get even close to the Yosemite Village due to traffic. I wish someone at the gate would say to us how busy it was before selling us 30$ park entrance ticket. We would simply turn around and visit on a different day, but unfortunately no warning was provided. Since we wouldn’t make our parking reservation time anyway, we have decided to visit Glacier Point and try to get to Yosemite Village later in the day. However we were not allowed to enter Glacier Point road and were redirected to the shuttle parking. We had to wait for the shuttle for 2.5 hours!

There is water half way up the hills of somemore popular walks so you don't dehydrate.Our only criticism is that the food outlets could have been of a higher quality.","July 16, 2016","Awesome, stunning, beautiful, wow!",42,Bath,5
Yosemite Valley,"What a beautiful national park! We visited during the week and on a Saturday. Very much recommend a visiting on a weekday and getting their early if you don't like crowds and waiting in lines in the stores. Our favorite hike was the one by the tunnel. It was rugged and just what we imagined. While the views found on the valley (more popular) trails need to be experienced, the paved paths and larger number of people weren't as attractive to us hike-wise. We found the best view from above, a short drive up to the top and no hiking - Glacier Point. I would love to go back and see the more rugged north side of Yosemite. Unfortunately, Sequoia was closed for road renovations during our visit. I would go back for that too!","July 16, 2016",WE LOVE YOSEMITE!!

Yosemite Valley,"We visited on Memorial Day and apparently chose a less crowded day to visit although there were still many, many people about.The previous day the tailback to enter the park had been over an hour long whereas we drove to the valley and parked with hardly a queue at all.Once there we took the bus to many of the points, took some walks around and were delighted with everything we saw but a day just doesn't give enough time to see everything.One of the Park Guides had kindly spent a little time with us before we set out and had suggested a number of key stops and we generally followed his advice to make the most of our time.On the way back, I took the wrong turn onto Tioga Pass but that turned out to be another highlight of our visit, despite the extra hour or so it added to our drive. The scenery along here was just stunning.If we're fortunate enough to come back here we'll make a point of staying a night or two so that we can fully explore this amazingly beautiful natural attraction.","July 16, 2016",One day is not enough,201,"Bury, United Kingdom",5

This is real beauty that only mother earth can create. it truly brings tears to my eyes to think about how the vision John Muir, and President Teddy Rosevelt helped create this park and the park system.

We quickly realized that the free shuttle buses would have done the job faster and much more efficiently.

It's recommended that you do your research on hikes. Many good ones are hidden and have priceless views.The beauty of Yosemite never gets old. Everytime you visit, the park can often look different. There may be waterfalls, less waterfalls, snow, colors changing from seasons, varieties of animals and scenery that have been enjoyed by visitors for decades.

This is why? The scenery is to die for. There are a lot of open meadows with gorgeous views of the valley you can rent a kayak to go down the Merced River or I bring my bike and we spend the whole day bike riding all around the valley floor going from one gorgeous waterfall to another. If we don’t bring our bikes, we can rent one or we can ride the free shuttles that take everyone all around the valley. There are lots of hiking trails, rock climbing and backpacking. Plenty of different restaurants and eateries, only complaint is that Yosemite is so popular during the summer that it’s so hard to get camping sites. Traffic is an issue if you want to drive your car all around the park but generally once you enter with your car and then park, you’ll find that you’re better off renting a bike or taking the free shuttle from each destination spot around the valley floor.","July 5, 2016",A Must GO!,80,"San Francisco, California",5

I'd also recommend the 2 hour valley floor tour. It's reasonably priced (currently $25/adult), narrated by a ranger, and you get to stop at two great viewing locations. This gives you a great overview which gives you ideas of what you want to check out further.Now, as we were leaving, there was a line of cars about 5 miles long waiting to enter the park.

The Mist Trail is a good one to take to see Vernal and Nevada Falls. Yosemite Village has shops, restaurants and the Ahwahnee Hotel. The Ansel Adams Gallery is also worth a stop. There are campgrounds and Curry Village in which to stay. Reservations are a must. Now for the downside. The valley is so crowded in Summer that every parking lot is full. They do have free shuttles, but these too are packed. My recommendation is to go in the Spring, Fall or Winter. We went in the Winter one year and it was fantastic. If you must go in the Summer, go early in the morning, see what you want, find something else to do in the afternoon and then go back to the valley in the evening. It's worth it whenever you go.

The NPS do a great job of keeping this area accessible to the masses for me this takes the beauty away from it. It doesn't feel like you'd see exciting wildlife at every corner, apart from a tourist eating maybe. It's worth a visit the famous sights are great to tick off but there are plenty of other great national parks more remote.

Yosemite Valley,"I decided to invite friends and family to celebrate my June 23rd birthday at Yosemite. We reserved close to a year ahead of time, my husband and I staying in Half Dome Village (formerly Curry Village) cabin with a private bath.Not knowing POTUS was going to be at Yosemite the same time we were (until that day), we planned on arriving and hopefully checking in a few hours early. However, hearing the Valley was cluttered by press and other entourage, we had a leisurely lunch at Big Trees (formerly Wawona) and arrived around 5:30pm without any issues (expensive lunch btw).Check in was smooth. Parking was available near the cabin. First, we did make a wrong turn from registration to the parking lot for tent cabins...so crowded! We found ONE available space, discovered we were in the wrong area, and headed to the correct area, which apparently is kind of hidden, off the beaten path. Otherwise, there may have been issues.We used to go to Yosemite and take our kids when they were young, always trying to avoid peak summer months. After this trip I will again avoid peak summer and holiday months. It was very, very crowded! It is an international destination.Take your bikes! It saves renting bikes at $12.50 an hour or $30 a day. We cycled everywhere! You're encouraged to park your car and take the free shuttle. I don't remember the shuttles being so crowded! There was an accident on one bridge (heard the driver had a seizure, overturned the car and died) which totally threw the shuttle service off for hours. The cabin with a private bath was a bit pricey but well worth our week there. So quiet, not crowded. We could keep our food in the cabin (a plastic bin was provided since the mouse problem). We actually have a plug in cooler which was wonderful! The bed was ok, a bit too springy for me. Full size bed with 3 different types of pillows, depending on your preference. There was also a twin bed which we never used. No air conditioning, but shade from the trees was awesome! We kept our windows open almost the whole time.The bathroom was very clean! You're provided with soap and shampoo from a dispenser, bath towels and toilet paper. There is a daily cleaning service. We switched our towels out once and that was it. California is in a drought and we didn't think we needed to have our sheets and towels changed everyday. Also took 5 minute showers.My only complaint would be there were spider webs under the windows. The curtains, if not opened, hid the webs.There is so much to see in Yosemite! It's absolutely stunning! Waterfalls, streams, forrest, meadows, mountains and trails galore - everywhere! Fortunately, the falls were still flowing abundantly. Later in the year could be very different.Each time we shuttled or rode our bikes into town near the lodge, it was very crowded! Best to start your day early to avoid some of the crowds. Earlier the better. Excursions we did -rafting (highly recommend but make reservation. $30 per person/ 4 man raft), horse back riding - not in the Valley anymore. We had to drive to Wawona, about an hour away. Two hour guided trail ride for $60. My bottom says an hour would have been fine ;) Cycling, cycling everywhere! So beautiful and peaceful. Hike or walk- ahh the fresh air, the birds, the waterfall view and the stream.No matter when you visit Yosemite, you will be awe struck!","June 27, 2016","Choose Your Dates Carefully for The Best Vacation, EVER!",34,"Torrance, California",5

With that said, the human factor could be better, way too crowded, new company that has taken over the food and lodging isn't doing a very good job. In June (peak season) restaurants were closed for remodeling, and those that were open mostly serve cafeteria quality food, and even at that they close early so that after a long day of hiking, there was no where to eat except to get something at the small grocery/general store there. The rangers we met were very friendly and informative. It was interesting to note how many different languages we heard from visitors from all over the world.

They come to see El Capitan the largest monolith on earth, to hike, to climb Half Dome, to experience the numerous waterfalls. Yosemite National Park is large but everyone congregates in the Valley and on a summer day it can look a traffic jam in a major city. That is the downside. The upside is the experience no matter how crowded. My suggestion: if you are able to walk any distances is to take one or two of the Valley Tour Loop trails.

Just one. If you want to picnic in Yosemite, bring your own blanket or plan a tailgate picnic with your crew. The bathrooms in Yosemite Valley were in general nasty. Either smelled bad from 50 ft. away at Bridal Veil falls, or it looked like the cleaning crew had not been around for days. But, the crowds Friday-Monday are heavy and lots of those people are on the trail head to the footbridge. Fresh water and public bathrooms are at the footbridge. Back from our hike, at 6pm on a Monday night, it took us one entire hour to move one mile down the road to get closer to a road out.

We knew we were going to stay outside the park, but what we didn't fully understand was the north vs. the south entrances to the park. We opted to stay in Oakhurst near the south entrance, but soon learned it would be almost a 2-hour car ride to Yosemite Valley (where all the main attractions are located) no matter if we drove via the north or south entrances. We actually loved the Oakhurst area, but if you want to get to the Valley quickly, staying closer to the north entrance (Hwy 140) is the best bet. 4-hrs a day drive time can get a bit tedious.

If you do venture in, do so as early in the morning as possible, otherwise you will waste precious time looking/waiting for a parking spot, or will need to park up at Badger Pass Ski Area and take a shuttle bus down to the valley/village. MANY of the drivers clearly are not used to handling their rental cars or, even worse, rental RVs. That said, the crowds were all in appropriate awe of their surroundings, and if not entirely friendly, at least tolerant of each other. Be prepared to stand in line.

Also, lots of hiking trails. There are campgrounds, Half Dome Village and The Majestic Yosemite Hotel to stay in. The problem is that it's too popular. The roads are crowded, the parking areas full, and the shuttles packed to maximum capacity. Something needs to be done to reduce crowding.

We stopped near Yosemite Falls to do the Lower Falls hike (lots of water and cold mist and good restroom with real plumbing at the base of the hike), walked the bridge along the meadows. It got a little crowded near the base of the Falls but everything else was just fine. On Friday we drove around again, did a hike around the Ahwahnee and then wanted to check out the visitor center. Keep in mind the parking is 10 mins away from the center, but with no hours posted. Turns out they close at 5! But we still got to check out souvenirs at the store, which was fun. Prices are REALLY good there, like a regular grocery store. They don't price gauge at all. And on the main trail to the store, there was a mule deer right there next to the main walking path. It was cautious of people but did not run away, just kept grazing. How awesome is that?! We saw mule deer several times grazing the meadows over the two days. We didn't encounter bad traffic at all. Even on the same day that President Obama arrived in his helicopter and several roads were closed off, but it still wasn't too busy. We didn't even try earlier in the day so no idea what kind of crowds that would be. So if you can, go after 3 pm! Really the Valley is quite beautiful, amazing to be at the bottom looking up.

The car parks fill up very quickly throughout the morning and the more popular trails are crowded, so to get the most of the experience of being in such an iconic location I suggest get here very early in the day and hike early before the crowds. The shuttle system is great however they get very full. A stunning location but you’re not going to get serene settings as much as you’d want.","June 19, 2016",Picture Perfect,175,"Melbourne, Australia",5
Yosemite Valley,"This is a wonderful park, and they've done well setting the park up for the many visitors that come here. The waterfall is incredible, the highlight for me. Good year to go as it is in prime form after an almost normal snow season and a hot week before we arrived. Signage could be improved, I'm good with navigation and this place gave me issues at first. Still too many people, but that's expected. It's unfortunate that people and their kids tend to act really crazy in beautiful places. Kids and adults jumping around on slick rocks take a little bit away from the natural peace that sets in around the falls. Just waiting for the next one to fall in and be hauled away from stupid. But the place itself is outstanding, the park can't help human nature...they try. And yes it can be done easily in a day unless you're planning so big hikes.","June 19, 2016",I have to give it an excellent because it is extraordinary,74,"Frisco, Texas",5
Yosemite Valley,"This place without a doubt is one of the natural wonders of the world.There are so many different places you can stop and enjoy the view, you could spend a week driving around the park and not see it all.All the main attractions or viewing area's are well signposted, & have parking place's.On top of this if hiking or trekking is your favourite thing, then fill your boots, there's dozens of trails from a gentle ramble to full on mountain hiking.All the trails are well mapped and marked.If you are looking to drive about the park, bear this in mind, the park is part of a mountain range. Therefore be prepared to do some pretty arduous driving, around mountain road's that are narrow and winde all over the place. This will mean allowing plenty of time, as we averaged about 25 mph, you will be climbing up road's that reach over 9,000ft up the mountain.Even in June there's snow in them there mountains at this altitude, not on the road but in the forest area's.It cost's $30.00 per car entry which is a bargain.There's plenty of toilets and at busy times there's free shuttle buses to running from holding areas up and back to the viewing points.You will be amazed at how well organised every thing is, nobody was dropping litter or fag butts all over the place, America's respect their national park and this encouraged every one else to follow suit.Even the porta loo's were spotlessly clean.","June 19, 2016",Outstanding natural beauty ,24,"Orpington, null, United Kingdom",5

Yosemite Valley,"We explored Yosemite as a group of 7, ranging from 8 to 63, none of us had ever been here before. We have now been to about a dozen National Parks in the US and Canada, most of them in the mountains. Yosemite did not disappoint, although we had very high expectations coming into our trip. While we didn't hike as much as we wanted due to my daughter getting sick and my 60+ year old Mother-In-Law having some limitations, we did spend 4 full days exploring the park. The Valley Floor, Sentinel Dome, Glacier Point, Tuolumne Grove, Olmsted Point, Saturday Night BBQ at Wawona and a horseback ride in neighboring Sierra National Forest were some of the highlights. We saw 2 different black bears and 3 Marmots as well as a dozen or more dear and a number of lizards and other small creatures. We also saw a number of birds unique to the Western Mountains including Steller's Jay, Western Tanager and a few others. I highly recommend a trip here and for families like mine that like to not just go places, but explore them deeper, I would strongly recommend 3-5 days depending on how much you want to hike or further explore the area. We were here for 4 and we could have easily filled another 2 days, but we didn't feel rushed and we experienced the things that were important to us. Definitely a trip worth taking.","June 18, 2016",Well worth the 4 days,18,"Metro Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota",5
Yosemite Valley,"The Valley Floor was as remarkable as expected with tremendous views of waterfalls and large granite features around every turn. The only downfall is the vast number of people that we experienced it with. This didn't detract from our experience, but it is hard to find a peaceful place or a an open shot of any of the more astounding areas. We spent parts of 3 different days in the valley and discovered that if you leave after 4:00 or so, you will wait at least 15 minutes if not closer to 30 to get out of the valley. Having said that, it's absolutely worth it. Yosemite Falls are amazing and the overall views from the Valley Floor are phenomenal. I highly recommend spending at least 4-6 hours here.","June 18, 2016",Lots to See and Lots of People to see it with,18,"Metro Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota",5
Yosemite Valley,"To start off, let me state that the views within the valley are very breathtaking and it has some of the most beautiful landscapes in the US. But the down side is that it is so overrun by private vehicles that it is not as tranquil as it ought to be. Being a non-driving traveller, the reliability of access to the valle has been the biggest issue for me. The public transport to and fro the valley needs improvement in terms of frequency, punctuality and reliability. The YARTS connecting the valley to the towns is infrequent at the far end and is often late. Schedule changes happen and no body in the park have any idea of those changes, not even the visitor information offices. The schedule changes are communicated via the YARTS website which is pretty useless since most mobile data networks don't work in the Yosemite area and there is WiFi only in a couple of spots within the valley. Moreover there is no cap on private vehicles driving into the valley which causes a lot of traffic snarls, crowding, noise and of course, damage to the ecosystem. The visitor information centres dotted throughout the valley are also pretty useless since they fail to give any additional useful personalised information. The most they will do is just read you though the bus schedules, hand over maps and direct you to nearby facilities. Don't expect much help in trip planning or information on schedule 0changes. However they do offer some nice tours around the valley. The glacier point tour was really good and the valley floor tour also seemed nice. There are also shuttle buses ferrying people around the valley which are very helpful. I would suggest that one should visit the valley for at least 3 days and stay within the valley to save commute time every day. Plan your trips really carefully if you are thinking of using public transport - be sure how far you are staying and time your transfers to take delays into account.","June 18, 2016",Beautiful Valley Badly Managed,12,"Singapore, Singapore",3
Yosemite Valley,"Think of Yosemite Valley as Disneyland for nature. There are massive crowds, there are buses and cars, there are the ubiquitous Japanese tourists with cameras. It is a world-class destination and you should see it, but go very very early and get out early. Yosemite falls is spectacular if there is water (we got lucky--there was). There are other ways to see the Sierra--the northern part of Yosemite along Tioga Road and the eastern Sierra, access from June Lakes or Mammoth Lakes is the same landscape without the hordes.","June 18, 2016",Go early in the am or don't go at all,24,"Durham, North Carolina",3

I started at the Yosemite Valley which is a 7 mile canyon. As a first time visitor, I prudently chose the shuttle operated by park authorities. Don't miss the Yosemite Falls which is the tallest waterfall in North America. It is actually made up of three separate waterfalls. Also unmissable is the Sentinel Falls. Not to miss is the Half Dome which rises 5000 feet from the valley floor. For better view of the Half Dome, take the one hour trail from Mirror Lake, a small seasonal lake.

Yosemite Valley,"This is hands down one of the most spectacular parks! The valley can be very crowded and it's hard to get a sense of tranquility on any of the trails or paths in the valley as you are always surrounded by hundreds of people. If you want a tranquil moment, drive into the park at 6:30 am, park your car in one of the lots, and hop on a bike. By 8 am you will be joined by hoards of people but we loved our 6:30 am rides each day. The Vernal Falls hike was spectacular! If you don't want to get wet ( and I mean completely wet) pack a poncho as the mist from the falls is more like a shower. It was a nice break from the intense heat so we didn't mind. Be careful with your phones, however, when you are hiking near the falls. If you don't have a waterproof case, you might want to keep your phone tucked away. The views from the top are spectacular. Bring your sunscreen and bring water. You will get thirsty on the way up. One of our favorite places to chill out every afternoon was the olympic sized pool near the Yosemite Valley Lodge. For $5/person, you can enjoy a glorious swim and they provide the towels. Who doesn't want to swim with an incredible view of a waterfall?

This place is the crown jewel of the National Parks and around every corner is a breathtaking view. I was also happy to get to go visit the (formerly) Awahanee Lodge. It is a beautiful old hotel, that is the inspiration for numerous mountain lodges. However......If at all possible, visit this park in the off season. The blessing of this park, and especially Yosemite Valley, is it's accessibility, but it is also it's curse. The place was absolutely jam packed with cars and people. The bus system is useful, but there were some long waits and lots of standing.

Yosemite Valley,"Visited on 08/06/16 – Yosemite National ParkThis National Park has many sights to behold and will take time to discover them all…we only went to a few key areas as we were on a very tight time schedule touring around, but what we saw was breath taking.When you enter the National Park, you will be required to pay $30 per car. You will have 7 days to use the value of this pass to upgrade (the cost of this access pass can be used as a deposit) to a multinational park access pass. I am not sure how long this multinational park pass will be valid for.The pass itself will be valid for 7 days. This National Park is massive, some 1200 square miles, so the 7 days can be easily used up.Soon after the park entrance you will find an information area and restrooms. We visited Yosemite National Park on a Wednesday and I have to say it was very busy with multinational tourists along with Americans…parking anywhere was a nightmare. You would need to get here early so you can get to the day car park to make full use of a central location to pick off the points of interest nearby. Alternative options would include lodging and camping on site; please see the details of the park’s website and of each of the lodging websites for further information.The park’s website will tell you important things about the weather at the park and which roads are closed.You will also need to study the map to find other locations for parking to do the remainder.Most points of interest can be driven to nearby and so long as you can park, you can hike the remainder.There are shuttle buses running around the Park so if you do not like hiking then these are a good option.Allow plenty of time for each point of interest and to find the best spot for capturing the sights on camera.There are general stores located at the village visiting centres so you can get snacks and drinks. Alternatively you can bring a picnic to the park or even eat at the restaurant.Please bring plenty of water with you and do not underestimate the importance of keeping hydrated here…also taking high energy snacks for hiking is a must.There are many marked trails which take you to some various named viewing areas; all are spectacular in their own right. Some are several miles long.You will be given information about the park along with timetabled events…we were looking forward to an evening of looking at stars with an organised hike with the Rangers however, this was not available on Wednesday and Thursday evenings. So please check the website to obtain as much information so that you can plan your days here.We had the opportunity to visit a few stunning areas of the park which included Glacier point (an absolute must for a spectacular vista), Yosemite Falls, rivers, Half Dome, El Capitan…there was simply not enough time for us to do more on our tight schedule but Yosemite National Park deserves more of your attention.Please check the weather before you set out and dress accordingly and always protect yourself from the sun… a hat is usually a good item of clothing that people tend to forget.Take plenty of water.Temperatures were around 33 °C (92 °F) during our brief stay at the Yosemite National Park.","June 10, 2016",Yosemite National Park,124,"Bicester, United Kingdom",5

Yosemite Valley,"My first visit to Yosemite Park and it was breathtaking. No end of things to do for people at varying abilities but for those that are in to hiking - wow!!!Top tips - never leave without your sunscreen, insect repellent, ALOT of water and enough food. First thing - when they rate the walks and hikes, the ratings and timings are real, not conservative. I am of average fitness so thought I might be better than their estimates. Nope. Second - many of the hikes are really steep so take all the water they recommend. It is like hiking in a desert uphill but so beautiful when you get to the top. Also take enough snacks and energy bars to keep you going as I burnt loads of energy getting to the top. Yosemite falls at the top is gorgeous but it is strenuous. Steep steps all the way. Mirror Lake is a great and easy walk. Half Dome - what can I say. Start walking at dawn, the heat is relentless so take the 4 litres of water they recommend and lots of food to keep your strength as you're going to need it. It is so beautiful though. We took 12 hours there and back. Glacier Point great to drive up to for sunset and stay to see the stars come out. Only disappointment was that the Mariposa Grove with the giant sequoia trees was closed. I will go back again as it really blew me away (and I need to see those trees) so if you've not been and you're in to hiking go for at least 5 days. You will not regret it and you.

Yosemite Valley,"The photos of this National Park do not do it justice! It has so much to offer, from the amazing views, to the plentiful waterfalls, and hiking trails!If you have ever been to New Zealand, then this will top some of the places you have ever visited. Also the drive up to the park is amazing, driving through the California wine, and fruit country.If you are ever in San Francisco, or California for that matter, it would defiantly pay to visit this national park!","June 6, 2016",Experience of a lifetime!,11,,5
Yosemite Valley,"Overcrowded and officially a tourist trap since 1889, especially during National Park Week and summer, but we didn't have many alternatives in mid-April as most of the park was still closed either because it was still the winter season with impassable roads or out of bounds for restoration reasons. If you're traveling during these times, I urge you to arrive early to secure a parking spot and use the FREE shuttle service. Reserve any accommodations well in advance as well.Host to lots of waterfalls like Yosemite, Vernal, Nevada, and Bridalveil, just to name a few, there are also wondrous cliffs to awe at or rock climb like El Capitan and Half Dome. Speaking of Half Dome, it's probably the #1 attraction in the park and one of the best hikes in the entire world. Get there sometime between June and September, with permit in hand, to knock it out.Biking is another good idea to avoid driving around the park aimlessly in circles due to crowds or testing your luck on the packed shuttle system. You can rent a bicycle at Yosemite Lodge or Curry Village Bike Stands from early spring to late fall for $10/day or $28/day.Winter brings ice skating at The Ice Rink at Curry Village from mid-Nov to early March. Downhill skiing or snow-tubing is also available at Badger Pass from mid-December through March.There's so many more events to discover and experience in the Valley like horseback riding, mountaineering school, photography, rafting, and backpacking. It's easy to see why it was the 4th most visited National Park in 2015 behind Great Smoky Mountains, Grand Canyon, and Rocky Mountain.","June 6, 2016",Best to allow days instead of hours,391,"Frederick, Maryland",5

Yosemite Valley,"It was drizzling when my group first arrived at Yosemite and we were bracing ourselves for a miserable day. However, the fog and chill lifted around mid-morning, and at that point everything became much better.There are several different tracks that you can take, depending on how much effort you want to put into your walk. Each route is well marked and easy to follow, and you can get around on the park bus. In the main visitor centre area, you'll find restrooms (few and far between, be warned!), a gift shop and a small cafe. This also appears to be where the campsite is, for those who want to camp out there.The park is incredibly beautiful, but do note that there are mountain lions and bears out there. Take sensible precautions and pay attention to the warning signs etc. They do also carry out controlled burns from time to time, which fill the valley with smoke - we stuck it out for about half an hour and then had to leave as it was becoming uncomfortable to breathe.Good points: gorgeous, nice walks.Bad points: deadly predators, occasional thick smoke.","June 5, 2016",As good as the photos.,138,UK,5
Yosemite Valley,"Absolutely beautiful but very crowded. Get in as early as possible, drive up to tunnelview (better light however for pictures in the afternoon), drive back down, take a quick look at the waterfall, than park over the side of the road to enjoy the views of the big waterfall (amazing in spring!), and park your car somewhere to take a longer hike.The trail up to the large waterfall (you can take a shuttle or if Lucky park your car at the trailhead near the campsite) is beautiful but not the easiest. 3 hours of steady climbing - with amazing views along the way - and finally a great view from the top of the waterfall. If you're not up to hiking to the top, the point halfway where you have great views of the fall is a good spot to turn around.Even in spring, there were lots of hikers.Another lovely trail is the mirror lake loop. Most people start clockwise, we didn't and had a beautiful quiet hike.Finally, when parking your car the huge parking lot, park as far to the front as you can! We didn't do so one day, and it took us 35 minutes to leave the parkingarea around 5 pm!","June 5, 2016",Beautiful but horribly crowded,166,Amsterdam,4

My wife and I got there near closing time on Friday which was not so bad and made it a point not to try and drive anywhere else until we left. The shuttles might be an option but you are going to be caught in the same traffic craziness. Hiking is a good way to get around but if you want to go faster I highly recommend bikes...you'll get around much faster than if you try to drive and you'll enjoy the fresh air that much more.I also recommend getting an early start; we did best by heading out on the trails by 7 AM...after that it gets pretty full and much less peaceful.","June 2, 2016",A great example of why we need National Parks,297,"Berkeley, California",5

Yosemite Valley,"We had one full day and wanted to see different things, but also do some (moderate) hiking with tennis shoes. Our plan worked out very well. First we drove to Brideveil Falls for a short stop (20 min roundtrip). Then we parked as close to the entrance of the Valley with a shuttle bus stop as possible. Believe it or not, but the free buses are awesome! They have their own lane, while cars are stuck in traffic. It was a Tuesday before the holiday season! Get rid of your car as soon as possible! We did the rest counter clockwise, as the buses run this way: from bus stop 16 we walked to the Vernal Falls. You can go to the bridge with a view of the falls (moderate, about 1 hour roundtrip) or to the top of the falls (strenuous). We chose the first option, as we had more plans. On our way back we turned right to Mirror Lake, where we had lunch at a lovely spot. The whole Mirror Lake loop takes around 2 hours. At the end the scenery is terrific, but it gets hot. Bring plenty of water! You can only go to the lake and back the same way, if you want to save time (in this case I would walk on the left side of the creek). The bus brought us then back to the Village, where we bought refreshments and souvenirs in the store. Our last and most impressive stop were the Lower Yosemite Falls (around 20 minutes roundtrip, walk clockwise to have the best views). What a wonderful day!","June 1, 2016",Suggestions for parking and trails,102,"Zurich, Switzerland",5
Yosemite Valley,"This is truly a stunning place to visit but it is an extremely busy park and this is one of the busiest places there is. To fully enjoy it (not wait hours in line!) either stay in the Valley (costly) or arrive very early in the morning so you can get a parking spot. The earlier the better. If you give up your parking space at the village, you may not find another, so be prepared to take the shuttles around to the trailheads. Even the shuttles can fill up during peak times, so be prepared. Bring a picnic lunch to enjoy and some water and snacks in a day bag. There are concessions, but they are pretty busy. If you get into the park early enough you can stop at Tunnel View and Bridalveil Falls on the way into the Valley. You can also pull off and take a good look at El Capitan and Half Dome as you drive in. The best time to visit the Valley is in the spring when the water is flowing and the crowds are not at peak. We went during mid-May and it was pretty good. (Not Memorial Day weekend!) Of course, some of the higher elevation trails and the Tioga Pass Road can still be closed this time of year. (We were fortunate in that they opened highway 120 early so we were able to drive it also.) Another alternative is to take the YARTS buses in from outside the park. Research the shuttle systems on the Internet sites. Be sure to visit Mirror Lake and Yosemite Falls too. They are easy hikes.","June 1, 2016",Gorgeous!

Barely found parking by Bridalveil Falls then decided to proceed farther afield, another mistake, as we never found parking despite over 3 hours of circling like its the Costco parking lot. The views in the park are spectacular and the hiking looks amazing, if only it was not for the thousands of tourists treating the place like it was an amusement park. Shoulder to shoulder crowds of selfie-stick-wielding-tourists made any attempt at hiking a farce.

Yosemite Valley,"The park is naturally beautiful but the whole experience is marred by poor management. There is a single lane road around the park for everyone - this means that you'll probably get stuck in traffic for 1-2 hours whatever time you go. We arrived at 7am and it was fine getting in but we left at 2pm and waited 2 HOURS TO GET OUT OF THE CARPARK. Add to this the poor signage, you really don't know where you are most of the time so we started one trail but the signs just stopped soon after we started. The staff are quite lazy, having arrived at 7am and 8am as recommended the visitors centre doesn't actually open until 9am. The rangers are a pretty unhelpful bunch - we were kept stewing in our carpark for 2 hours by these guys who just waved through all the traffic from each direction apart from ours - even though this was the official visitors centre carpark. The maps are pretty unclear, the shuttle bus stops are not properly marked and even at peak times they run every 30 minutes - so if you miss one you'll be guaranteed the next one will be too full to get on. Some people waited an hour just to get on a shuttle bus once in the park. Compare this to the seamless organisation of Zion, Bryce and Grand Canyon and you wonder why this park is so popular - the scenery is just as spectacular in these other parks and they are a pleasure to navigate.","June 1, 2016","Not Visitor Friendly - very poor infrastructure, traffic, little parking, poor signage and terrible bus service",33,london,3

People are everywhere and traffic can be a bit of a nightmare. Parking is a battle at peak times so get there early.So much to do! There are lots of trails and vantage points to check out.

There's kayaking which i wished we had time to do.The shop in the village is affordable and has sandwiches, salads, drinks and snacks so that's great. The staff who are around are friendly and very helpful too. It takes a long time to get there! We started over on the east and drove Tioga road and it took about 2 hrs to get down into the valley due to photo stops and traffic. Took a while to get out too.Driving down the actual valley road has great photo views. There's space on the side of the road to park so keep an eye out. One of the nicest is after some tunnels.. There's a bridge with a waterfall on the left then amazing views of the park off to the right.The views are amazing and it's a fantastic place but those things are worth knowing.","June 1, 2016",Amazing and worth the detour but a few things to consider,6,,5
Yosemite Valley,"The park is very crowded so get there as early as possible, park your car and use the free park shuttle buses. On your way into the park, you will see a sign to the Bridleveil Falls. You should be able to park there and it's a fairly easy walk to the falls. After that drive on to Yosemite Village and park in one of the big car parks there and use the bus. Do note well where you parked as its easy to get lost when you try to find it again (speaking from experience!). The shuttle bus stops at different points where you can get out and walk. Stop 6 is for the Lower Yosemite Falls. Stop 17 is for a fairly easy almost flat walk to the Mirror lake and stop 16 is for perhaps the best of walks for normal walkers (as opposed to serious hikers) to the Vernal Falls. It is quite steep along the river but you can stop and go back when you have walked enough if you do not want to go the whole way.The Valley will certainly occupy a day. If you have more time there are two other trips you can make. One to Glacier Point which gives you fabulous views from on high over the whole valley. This really only takes half a day. The other (longer) is along the Tioga road. Both of these do not open till towards the end of May. As to where to stay, of course it would be best in the park but accommodation there seems to be either very expensive or booked out. We stayed in Mariposa which is a quaint former gold mining town and a nice place to stay. It does though take a good hour to drive to the park entrance although it is a pleasant drive partly along the Merced river and not too much traffic on the road (end of May).","June 1, 2016",How to see Yosemite,41,Welwyn,5
Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite's vistas are spectacular. After waiting in 2 hours of traffic to get from Bridalveil Falls to the Valley though there is almost a disappointing irony to the initial scene.  There is no question as to why Yosemite was named a national park in 1890. Humans are awed and attracted to the utterly unique and majestic landscape. When my family and I were finally able to park in what seemed like one of a hundred spaces made available to tens of thousands of visitors, we checked in with a comfy ranger in a yurt for some maps. She told us we were lucky to get a spot and I remarked that parking did seem like a problem. She replied to the effect that parking is not the trouble in Yosemite, it is the one lane road (which is really 2 but used as 1), but they don't want to make more space, Yosemite just needs population control. I ruminated on this commentary for sometime feeling sad about her rather smuggly stated sentiments. Yosemite is a truly awesome place beloved not only by Americans but a plethora of international travelers. A diverse group of visitors from all over the world seems to flock to this site almost like pilgrims to a holy place. In a space this grand there could easily be room for all to remain small. Yosemite needs better logistics but, while the government of 1890 did a great job preserving the land, the government of 2016 offers an eye full of how big bureaucracy can gum up the works even to the highest peaks and lushest valleys.It is worth it to get past the frustration of a badly managed federal project full of rangers who function mostly as well paid parking attendants. If you lift up your eyes and hike away from the crowds, the reason to see Yosemite remains abundantly evident.","May 31, 2016",Bumper to Bumper Traffic to be in the Great Outdoors,27,"Grosse Pointe, Michigan",4

Yosemite Valley,"First off, I've been to Yosemite many, many times in the last 40 years since my first trip and love the valley. However, every trip in recent years has seen increasingly larger and larger crowds on the valley floor. So much that this last trip had some of the fun taken out of it by the large crowds. Currently, the amount of water in the park is responsible for some FANTASTIC water falls. Everything was so green and lush. Even with imminent rain the sights were gorgeous. Perfect for photography. Back to the crowds. I'm worried that we are reaching a tipping point with how crowded the valley is becoming. There are just too many cars on the roads and with all the people walking in and out of traffic it's just a matter of time before tragedy strikes. Maybe it's time for a new shuttle service plan with off sight parking, similar to Zion National Park.

The Yosemite Valley is as surreal as the postcards indicate and every viewpoint and walk about is laced with stunning views of falls, cliffs, rivers and trees. Definitely worth the visit. But unfortunately it's like an LA freeway trying to get in and trying to get around. The ridiculous traffic and hordes of people really upset the whole experience. As beautiful as it was after a while I just wanted to get out of there. If I was to do it again I'd take the regular bus from Fresno to avoid the traffic, but that still doesn't do anything about the hordes. We got stuck in a line up for over an hour trying to get to the village and when we finally arrived there was a ranger directing everyone away as the village was full. Even then it was a nightmare trying to park anywhere. Incredible scenery but they've got to do something about the massive crowding and car issue as it ruined things. I would not return.","May 22, 2016",The best and worst of parks,57,"Vancouver, Canada",4
Yosemite Valley,"The overwhelming beauty of this fabulous National Park is indescribable. In full bloom, with spring melt from the mountains gushing over waterfalls, views surrounding us with grandeur, we were blown away. May 2016 was magical--no crowds (fewer, anyway), minor traffic jams, and good weather (a lucky break).Take your time getting to the Valley. Many fabulous views and hikes take place on the way in. Look for the giant sequoia groves on Rt 120 east (just a few minutes off the entry road), and hike down the 1 mi. paved path to see them.This has inspired us to find and enjoy other national parks, and soon!","May 22, 2016",Flowers and waterfalls: May is the time!,81,Tallahassee,5
Yosemite Valley,"We took the hwy 120 drive into the park stopping at each pull out to enjoy beautiful views and waterfalls as we approached the valley. Sometimes it was difficult to find a slot to park among the others enjoying the same. I can't walk great distances, so in the valley we planned to park the car and take the shuttle to enjoy all the sites and short hikes to each attraction but all parking lots were FULL, roadside parking FULL We were lucky to get a parking spot at Bridalveil Falls (can't get a shuttle from there) The short hike was beautiful but I was very distracted by so many people, having to negotiate between and around to make advances up the path. It was fun to experience the mist of the falls, we got very wet. We made the best of the crowd situation, stopping at less traveled picnic areas to get away from the crowds and soak in the surroundings. While driving you have to be so aware of other cars and buses it's hard to enjoy the beauty around. After circling the park twice we were LUCKY to get a parking spot a half mile from the base of Yosemite Falls. It was a beautiful walk to the lower falls but again so many people to negotiate around it was difficult to focus on the beauty of Yosemite. We left sooner than planned, unable to see all that we had hoped for. Next visit, we will either pay the high price to stay in the park or arrive very early in the morning.","May 22, 2016","Stunning Views, Crazy Crowded",24,,4
Yosemite Valley,"visited may 2016 on a sunny weekend. I finally got a glimpse of what John Muir must have seen. The rains this year have produced not only breathtakingly forceful waterfalls but also gorgeous meadows to create mindbogglingly beautiful scenery. Insanely long lines to enter the park and the valley loop but well worth it, who knows when Yosemite will look this amazing again with how the droughts going. Parked at the first opportunity and took the shuttle/trails to get around the valley and the falls. Spent the second day in Hetch Hetchy, again amazing waterfalls gushing down the granite cliffs. Took the wapama trail and was surrounded by wildflowers and butterflies, an amazing and unexpected experience that culminated at the footbridge of the roaring wapama falls.

There are visitors from all over the world because it is well worth it. To see all of the falls (several have hiking trails to the top), the museums and other attractions will take a few days but even a one day trip is worthwhile.

It was before peak season and yet still pretty crowded (could not imagine the summer season). The waterfalls were in full blast. We did not know that most become trickles or disappear through much of the year, so we were thrilled to see them at their peak. So many dramatic waterfalls.

Yosemite Valley,"Most of my time in national parks has been in the iconic, mountainous parks. This is an inverted experience: You are at the bottom of the valley with granite peaks and waterfalls looming overhead. The waterfalls were at a peak when I was there, and it was unforgettable. The valley is embracing because of the infrastructure - walkways, shuttles, grocery stores, restaurants -- but does not overwhelm the setting. I'm not sure what the complainers were expecting. This is a World Heritage Site and, like all popular destinations, requires some planning and patience. Absolutely use the shuttles when you can; if you don't, you are contributing to the congestion and infrastructure strain you are complaining about.","May 18, 2016",Still in a Daze,61,"Seattle, Washington",5

Our driver commented she had transported 215 people in the last 30mins. The shuttle bus is a waste of space/time, showing little more than from comfort of your car.We felt as if we were in a large American holiday park as in the large central area buildings, hotels, burger bars or tents can be seen in every direction and the authorities have sold-out/lost the sense of majesty/wilderness. Disappointing.The best views & plentiful parking are on the one-way road from the toll station into the central area.Take in your own food & drink.

The animals on the valley floor were hiding, but the animals in the store were patrolling the aisles, grabbing any flashy trinket or buy meat for their barbeque, and hurrying to wait at any interminably long lines. All I wanted was a Yosemite pin. Prices are ridiculously over-inflated, so expect to pay $8 for a $3 pin. The valley is not car friendly, but if you have a disabled sticker you can drive to anywhere (not yet for us).

The park was very busy and can only just imagine how it gets during the summer. I would say that May is a great time to visit before the rush.

They run quite frequently and go further beyond to starting trail points where you can't go with your car.

Yosemite Valley,"A unique geological formation resulted in a Valley with a flat floor and very steep mountain cliffs all around it. The steep cliffs and flat floor result in wonderful views. Changes in light can and do result in dramatic changes in the view. I am a pretty bad photographer but I keep on trying. This is one of the few places on earth I can go and have a hard time taking bad pictures. Places to see while you are there:1) Yosemite falls. Everyone goes but since its one of the two attractions you can see almost anywhere in the valley its worth going to see it. It is the tallest water fall in the United states. Or so I have read somewhere.2) Bridle Vale falls. Not as tall but in the spring time if you go to see it you will get wet. Its mostly just fun.3) Mirror lake. Only on a sunny day with at most a light breeze. You will be able to look up at the mountains and then down at the mountains. Nearly perfect reflection. Note Mirror Lake is filling with silt and will probably completely cease to exist sometime in the next few years.4) Amazingly few people actually do it but you should go out into the middle of the meadow. If nothing else you will get away from all the people if you go there on a busy day.5) One of the Sequoia groves. tuolumne Grove, Mariposa grove and one other. The trees are enormous and a sight to see. Mariposa is closed this year but it will be back open next year.6) Between mid May and sometime in October you have to go to tuolumne Meadow. Its at nearly 10,000 feet but its amazing. If you have time you should go through the Park's eastern gate down to Mono Lake if you managed to get all the way to tuolumne meadow. Oh yes you can get to the meadow in the middle of winter if you want to sky up from the valley good luck.7) There are several more water falls and many miles of trails.If you get the impression I love the place you are right on.

If you're coming up from Fresno, I suggest taking the south entrance, coming up from Oakhurst, it's probably the less travelled road and not as scenic, but it's nice. It'll take you through Wawona and then into the Valley near Bridalveil Falls. You'll go through a tunnel which will open up to a majestic view of El Capitan and Half Dome -a definite picture taking opportunity. Just park to the left or right after the tunnel. Beware...it's a very popular spot for pictures. Once through the tunnel, you'll head to Yosemite Valley where it just gets prettier and prettier. You won't be disappointed by the views and scenery.I suggest you spend at least a few days exploring the south side of Yosemite, especially during the winter, where it's even more spectacular!

Yosemite Valley,"Although it's relatively small in size, it's one on the most diverse parks for activities I know. I have been going to Yosemite since I was 5 years old camping in the canvas tents, worrying about bears, there were many back then, seeing large deer, fishing the valley river, and hiking the high country. Today it's more commercialized yet ecologically protected. It's majestic trees and waterfalls are power fall, and has the worlds largest exposed granite formation that climbers may be seen ascending on your visits.Early spring is the best time to go I think to view the waterfalls. But don't get too close. A peaceful feeling from ionic activity is present and why we are probably mystified by them. There are roads and trails to explore. If possible stay in the valley at least one night if you can. Make reservations early however. The park is less than 200 miles from San Francisco and I have done many day trips with guests although the last 40 miles are somewhat curvy and a little slower traveling.","May 1, 2016",Most Beautiful National Park in the Nation,126,"Williamsburg, Virginia",5

And if you're in to those kinds of stuff, then you will fall in love with this place too. It's so peaceful and relaxing here. The views don't look real especially on how they register on pictures.

We were there for two nights and that worked out well (we got to the park around 11). We saw almost all the highlights. I would recommend at least staying two nights and even three.

And what is with the complete lack of trail signage? They have all these nice posters letting you know of the 200 people per year who get carried out on a stretcher seemingly while trying to take a hike. Maybe mark the trails better? You can easily go for over a mile with no clue if you are still on the trail you want. In Wisconsin they have nice little tiny signs every 1/2 mile at least. Challenge;Post more signs and see if you can lower that 200 to something respectable like 50.

We took the 120 and the 140 and neither roads were awful. I would highly recommend if you're going there -- spend the money to stay overnight inside the park it would,be worth the time you will spend driving. Unlike other national parks where you can easily save money and stay outside the parks and get to where you need to go without spending 2 hours of your time. Of all the people we talked to who had been to Yosemite not one person mentioned how horrible the roads are to get into Yosemite Valley. By horrible I mean long and winding and time consuming.

Yosemite Valley,"I didn't even know that this place was on my bucket list until I came here. I can honestly say I have never been to a more beautiful place in my life - and I've traveled a good deal. First of all, the season, in early April, is still only beginning so it is a terrific time to go as you avoid the crush of the summer crowds. Additionally, California had only recently come out of a protracted drought and the recent rainfalls had made the park, (and the surrounding countryside), come alive. The waterfalls were full and spectacular! The drive into the valley from the park entrance, (there are several), is stunning in every direction: thundering waterfalls, lush green valleys and the soaring granite virtuosity of Yosemite's many rock formations, not least of which of course is intimidating El Capitan. No matter where you look in Yosemite (Valley, but really anywhere you go), is breathtaking. I actually found the experience overwhelming and quite emotional at times. We only had one full day in the park which was way too little so we could not wander very far but even considering what little we saw, we came away from it having seen so, so much beauty. My partner and I will definitely be going back again, this time I think to spend about 5 days and get in some serious hiking. Be forewarned, if you want to stay in the park you need to book about a year in advance so get planning!

Yosemite Valley,"I gave been coming to Yosemite Valley since the mid-1960's. Back then, there were no shuttles, campgrounds had numbers, Camp Curry and the concessions were run by Curry. Bears fed off garbage at the open garbage fields. And the fire fall was a nightly event in the summer. The valley has changed somewhat since then, but the majestic beauty remains untouched. Mirror Lake and the Merced River are still beautiful and clear. Camp Curry still has tent camps and ranger led campfire talks. They have greatly reduced the car traffic in the Valley over the years and could go even further. In Summer, traffic was getting crazy. The shuttles cut down on vehicles and are nice convenient ways to get around the valley. If you MUST drive, you can to limited areas in the Valley. Other areas, like Happy Isles and Mirror Lake, only accessible by shuttle and foot. This preserves the natural beauty to a greater extent. They also thankfully got away with open garbage pits, and now aggressively ensure bears are not fed by humans.There are options for lodging, but you aren't going to find anything on the spot or last minute, unless you don't mind the walk in camp ground near Yosemite Falls. Spaces there are limited in Summer, also, and fill fast. Rooms go from hundreds per night at the Ahwahnee, to considerably less for tent cabins at Curry, or the facilities at housekeeping. Camp spaces also fill well in advance, especially on weekends and in Summer. The Valley has several grocery stores, larger and smaller. Prices are generally higher in the Valley for everything. There are also several dining options at Curry, the Village, the Ahwahnee, and the Lodge, from pizza and ice cream to burgers and gourmet. They no longer sell gasoline in the Valley, also. Wawona has gas, as does El Portal. The main attraction is the Valley itself and there are trails galore of varying difficulty. You can climb up to Glacier Point, or the top of Yosemite Falls. Or hike up the round side of Half Dome. Or just walk along the Merced, or through one of the meadows. Yosemite is a true treasure to enjoy again and again.

The weather forecast called for snow in mid-April, though it ended up being sunny every day and the occasional high cloud added depth and texture to our photos. The scenery and massive scale of the rock formations at Yosemite are so incredible that it is no wonder John Muir dragged President Roosevelt out to the valley and pitched him on the idea of federal preservation of wild places like Yosemite. Many times each day I found myself looking up at El Capitan, Half Dome, Yosemite Falls and other stone walls and feeling so incredibly small. The park itself is quite large, much bigger than the valley where most guests visit. The assortment and variety of hikes is such that there is something for everyone, form a half-mile flat hike in the valley to a 7-day technical climb of El Capitan from the valley floor. We loved both the Upper Yosemite Falls hike and the Lower Falls loop, which was a wonderful way to stretch our legs after the punishment of the 9-mile+ Upper Falls adventure the previous day.

Yosemite Valley,"I don't even know where to start. This was one of those trips that will stay with me for a very long time. We stayed just outside the park in a small town at the south gate, Oakhurst, CA. It appeared that many other people stayed in that town as well. We didn't head for the park when we arrived but left the next morning. By the time we got there some of the areas were already closed. This was something we didn't expect but there were plenty of other venues to see.We're not hikers. Thus, we elected to drive ourselves around the park allowing us to stop and leave or change our travels at will. Many people parked their cars and then hopped on a bus to tour. It was a busy park day and we did have trouble finding parking space at many locations but this worked out for us.It was a beautiful day but the drought had clearly impacted the area. From struggling trees to water falls (especially Bridalveil), it was clear that rainfall was lacking in this area.Not to be missed is the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias. This is one of the areas that was closed in the morning but as people left it opened up and we were able to park and walk the area late in the day. There are a couple of fabulous hotels in the park, each having their own characteristic structure. Wawona is a huge white shingled building with a wide front porch and a lovely restaurant. It's a good place t start because of the visitors' center and small museum. But the real gem is The Ahwahnee hotel. This area was one that was very difficult to locate a parking space. But be patient, they do exist as people come and go. I understand that it is very difficult to book a room in this hotel and I can see why. The location along is enough to draw you in, at the bottom of a valley with beautiful vistas everywhere you look. But the hotel itself is one of the most fantastic buildings I have seen. You may see it as a museum, maintaining the aura of the past while being updated and functional. Wish I could have seen a guest room!I could go on and on, but other reviewers have provided detailed explanations of what to see.

Even though there were so many people, there were huge meadows in the valley where we could sit and not see anyone, just the views of the canyons and cliffs. Some names have changed of the lodging in the valley, and the maps have not, and the signage is not always very good, so finding our way to different spots was somewhat challenging.

Yosemite Valley,"Stayed in Oakhurst and intended to travel in by car to the Park. This was the end of March. According to CA law, you have to have snow chains in your car in case of snow fall in the mountains. According to Car Hire rules, you are not allowed to fit snow chains.A problem in the makingIntended to hire a set as the outright purchase is a 3 figured sum. Could not find this facility in Oakhurst. Had no intention of using them due to the Car Hire rule.Talked into taking the 2 hour bus ride into the Park. This is a poor service that runs every 3 odd hours. Once in the Park we planned on using the shuttle to get around. Only one of the 2 shuttle services we operational in March. So your trip is limited and somewhat inconvenient. A number of views could therefore be impossible to see.The El Portal route was on a lower elevation. The same rules applied. But everybody was using that without snow chains. In fact, when I tackled visitors; they knew nothing about the snow chain law.I would recommend that you gamble on El Portal as the Rangers seem to ignore the Law of California.","April 8, 2016",Snow Chain Issues can ruin your trip,108,Brighton,2

We left very early and had most of the valley to ourselves for the first couple of hours, this is an experience none of us will ever forget, the tranquility, smell of pine trees, and stunning breath taking scenery. Anyone who gets to experience this is a very lucky person, and at the moment we feel like a very lucky family! The weather was perfect for us, and every moment was magical, we went round several times just trying to take it all in. We hired bikes from the Valley lodge and this for us made the whole experience so much better than taking the free bus, out kids would never have been able to walk the ground we covered in a day.","April 5, 2016","Amazing, but go early and go on a bike!",78,"Lincoln, United Kingdom",5

We took the 2 hour valley floor tour which we thought was a good way to see some of the highlights. We also did the Mirror Lake hike ourselves which was fabulous. Our only disappointment was that Mariposa Grove was closed. The park is breathtakingly beautiful and if you are a rock climber and/or a hiker this is paradise. Mother Nature is at her finest in Yosemite. Great to see children being children here and no I pads in sight, rather looking for large sticks, riding bikes or just enjoying the environment.

Meaning not enough parking in the valley for everyone. there is a Shuttle bus service but always full and very infrequent, making it a bit of a nightmare to rely on. I think that somehow a new system is needed for the valley to make travel here sustainable for the future. But itself the place is just awesome hence its popularity. You'll not be disappointed you've visited in the end. My Advice, Arrive early grab good parking near where you want to visit and spend the day in the mountains.

We stopped off at a few creeks to feel to ice cold mountain water and observed a number of deer just milling around chilling by the creek. Looking up the face of the water falls is breath taking.

Yosemite Valley,We flew to San Francisco then hired a car to drive here. Just passed the entrance we had to pull over and get out of the car as the sheer size of these 'mountains' is breath taking. Other people were doing the same. All the way in to the car park you are in awe at the scenery. Free car park and then a free shuttle to which ever part you wanted to explore. There are trails that go from an hours walk right up to 6 hours walk. We did the hour one but as it was all uphill ( great views all the way ) it took as quite a long time. There are little log cabins that contain toilets along the trail. Take plenty of water with you although there are water fountains dotted around. I personally didn't like the taste of that water. Back down near the carp ark are souvenir shops and self service restaurants. There is the largest supermarket I have ever see on a camp site. Sells everything you could possibly need. We stocked up on goodies to take back to our hotel for the evening. If we ever go back I would consider camping here even though I prefer to be in an hotel the camping facilities are excellent.,"March 31, 2016",Amazing,38,"Cardiff, United Kingdom",5

Yosemite Valley,"I'm not sure how fair of a review this is because the day before we arrived we visited Sequoia. Yosemite is beautiful. Tunnel View was one of the most surreal sights I have ever laid my eyes on, however, the crowds took away a lot of the magic. It took us over an hour to get into the park, Once we arrived in we were basically in a caravan of cars throughout the whole park. Every once and a while there would be a break, but it didn't last long. The epic views were blocked by cars parking in the middle of the street so they could get the photo they wanted. People dodging cars to get the perfect spot. Once we got to the Village that was chaotic. My husband drove around for about an hour trying to find parking. Thankfully he did because that gave us time to get my son's Junior Ranger badge. This program is great and he actually learned quite a bit and was really interested in what the rangers had to say. If it weren't for the crowds I would give Yosemite 5 stars. I would suggest finding a time that isn't as crowded as spring break.","March 30, 2016","Beautiful, but crowded",80,"Chino, CA",4
Yosemite Valley,"I booked a day trip tour through Grayline Sightseeing company due to tight schedule. Otherwise, I would highly recommend an overnight stay so you can enjoy the the village, valley and the falls without rushing around.The tour was about 13-14 hours return. It's about 3.5 - 4 hours each way from San Francisco to Yosemite National Park. You'll have around 4 hours to go around the village. I definitely had the worst weather during my visit as it was snowing the night before and rain non-stop during the day. It was cold and windy as well. But it didn't stop all the tourists to enjoy the park despite the closure of few trails to the falls due to flash flooding and slippery surface. The Yosemite Fall itself is stunning. You can go around the village with the local bus (Free and Green bus only). Highly recommended this place to others.

Yosemite Valley,"So I had the pleasure of visiting this quite frankly stunning national park, everything about this place is calming, beautiful and reminds you that you are very very small indeed.The HUGE mountains, the trees, the sounds, the smells, the animals running around, this place reminds you that nature at its finest and untouched is simply a joy to behold and take in and have your breath literally taken away, its like walking into an oil painting and being surrounded by an almost surreal beauty away from the city life we all live.The staff were all great, we did the Valley floor tour, I have to say that the tour guide we had was funny, excitable, knowledgable and really really loved what he did, where he worked and his passion and enthusiasm rubbed off on you, I would throughly recommend a tour, you get a lot of information, get shown around and this just makes it easier for you to go off on your own and visit the places you most want to see.The genera dining hall was ok, busy but had lots of tables and we didnt have to wait long to get served, various hot and cold foods, not overly prices and not much to fault.The main restaurant wasn't open when we went so I cannot tell you what it was like, though I am led to believe its pretty good.I should give a mention to the tour staff booking area, we missed the tour on one day, they gave us tickets to the next day no problems, we also had a problem with a missing booking, they refunded us the money for the unwanted tickets and they didnt have any proof but our word that we had bought them, thats great customer service and is a real plus for the company !!All in all if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle, enjoy stunning views on mountain roads leading into the park, want to be simply blown away by the sheer beauty of the waterfalls and views then this is the place for you to go !!!","March 28, 2016",Amazing,13,"London, United Kingdom",5

If crowds and traffic bother you, then choose a time when the park is less crowded, like Jan-Feb, late April, early May, October-Dec 10.

The half dome can be hiked, but you have to apply for a ballot. We, unfortunately, we're not successful this time. Down in the Valley, there is a courtesy bus that transports tourists around to several stops for free. We used this hop on/off bus often. From memory, there's about 17 stops.

Bridal Vail, Yosemite Falls, and several waterfalls that only appear in the early spring were flowing in full force - not like our last visit when California was in an extreme drought and the falls were thin slivers and nearly dry. It was rainy and overcast on our arrival and departure, but the two days in the middle were warm and sunny. There are now elevated trails across the meadow so that the meadow can become natural and not trampled by humans. Many areas are closed off so that rehabilitation can take place, but that doesn't mean you can't come and enjoy the park.

Yosemite Valley,"What a beautiful place to visit. I'm sure you can easily look up all the wonderful places in Yosemite, so I'll tell you a story instead. So waaaay back in 1994 I was on my honeymoon up there and after we hiked up the side of one of the waterfalls closer to the campground (can't remember the waterfall name), we took a lunch break. Sweating a bunch from the hike, I took off my t-shirt and laid on the cool ground, with a small smooth rock as my pillow. I began eating some pumpkin seeds. I placed a handful on my chest to work on when a squirrel hopped up onto my stomach and decided to start chowing on my seeds. OK, I thought it was cute, so I just watched. After a few minutes I was ready to eat my sandwich, so I shewed him off, then I reached in my bag and pulled out my turkey and cheese sandwich. Well, I go to take a bite, still laying on the ground and rock, mind you, and I feel something on my right shoulder, so I look over and saw the squirrel's front paws on my shoulder, but before I knew it, he had the meat and cheese, that was hanging out, between his thieving little teeth. I squeezed down on the sandwich... hey I was hungry after the hike... BUT there was mayonnaise on each side of the bread and that squirrel was quick. The moral of the story? Pay attention to those signs that say not to feed the wild animals! The lil' buggers don't appreciate the snacks! They'll go for the vault! ;)","March 15, 2016",Beautiful National Park,9,"Big Bear Lake, California",5

Yosemite Valley,"When I first discovered the Yosemite Valley, I feel in love with it and went back a 2nd time after only 3 months because this place is just so peaceful and full of the nature you crave for when you live in a big city. There are walking trails for all levels from beginners (flat land) to experts (6-hours trails going up and down muddy, slippery or steep roads), going through waterfalls, lakes, forests or open fields... Lodging is also full of options and for all budgets : from camping with your own tent to 3/4 concrete walls where you cook your own food over a fire you make yourself, heated tents with a cantina for everyone, wooden rooms and luxurious hotel rooms. There is every level of confort you want; it's up to you to decide what you want to experience. It's really family-friendly too : you can rent bikes, walk, trail, barbecue, and most of all, enjoy the views... The park is good at explaining to you how not to attract bears to the camps by avoiding to throw trash on the trails or keep open food in the car. They have bear-proof boxes where you put away your food and toiletries and rangers circling the camps to watch out for bears so you feel safe. I love going there in the spring (april, early may) when the waterfalls are at their fullest and it's still a little chilly (especially when you go on steep trails and sweat) and not too full of tourists. Going in september means very little water in rivers and waterfalls left. The only downside: only one road to get in and out of the valley so you can be stuck in traffic. I thus sontrgly suggest you reserve lodging well in advance so you can stay within the valley for 2-4 days and avoid the hassle of driving in and out. Just park your car once, enjoy nature at its best and forget about the city life.","March 14, 2016","Magical, peaceful, beautiful, a must see",61,"Paris, France",5

Yosemite Valley,"Always a spectacular visit no matter what time of the year. We opted to enter from Highway 41, which has the beautiful tunnel vista — a must see turn-out and photo op. Bridalveil, Yosemite, and Vernal Falls — all gushing the winter snow melt and providing great cascades of whitewater. Our 31 February 2016 visit was somewhat distracted by the changeover of vendors from Delaware North to Aramark the following day. Curry Village was completely closed — grocery, mountaineering store, food services, and they were not even renting cabins. Everything was locked up tight. (I have never ever seen it that way before). Only two buses were running in the park, so the bus service was somewhere around 45 minutes apart rather than 10 minutes. Many common areas were taken up by Aramark interviewing and training new employees. We saw many Delaware North employees with dejected looks after loosing their jobs. And the services in Yosemite Village all closed early. The Mountain Room restaurant, normally open 3 hours for dinner, was only scheduled to be open for 2 hours (no food after 7 PM), but in actuality was only open for 75 minutes (they were turning people away after 6:15 PM). But then Delaware North is the company that is forcing the name change of all of the historic establishments — the Awanee Hotel, Curry Village, the Wawona Hotel, etc., because Delaware North copyrighted all of the names and are now demanding $50,000,000 for the transfer of the copyright. It's outrageous that a company is holding our beautiful Yosemite National Park and its heritage hostage to attempt to get more cash for their investors. Good riddance!

So look up at the magnificent mountains, crags and cliffs that surround this special valley. The pine forests provide that peaceful dark green in contrast to the sharp gray granite that forms the backdrop for all that goes on in the Valley.

The Yosemite Lodge and Ahwahnee Hotel offer lodging (cottages are available through the Ahwahnee), but advance reservations are strongly advised, especially during the summer. One can rent (or take your own) bicycles and the bike trails are plentiful. Even for a day trip there is plenty to see and experience. We were there just before Valentine's Day this year. The waterfalls were flowing, there was snow on the ground which looked so pretty, a deer walked near our car and ""posed"" for some photos, and it was a glorious sunny day.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is just amazing! We visited in Feb 2016 for the second time and just love this place! As it is winter- you are required to carry snow chains in your vehicle at all times incase of extreme weather conditions. We had a hire car- that didn't allow for snow chains- not that we needed them this trip as it wasn't snowing & there wasn't snow on the roads; we caught the YARTS up from Oakhurst. The YARTS was $20 per 2 adults & 1x6 year old and included the entry fee to the park. It was definitely the easiest and safest option for us as being from Queensland, we are not familiar with driving in icy/snow/wintery conditions. The YARTS was about 2 hours from Oakhurst. Now on to Yosemite. Pictures of Yosemite just don't do this place justice. It is stunningly beautiful. The Valley itself if easy enough to navigate around as there are signs posts and maps about. There is a visitors centre and medic centre located in the valley. The valley is full of hiking trails and gorgeous scenery to admire. There is parking all along the way and plenty of places to have lunch or nibbles while admiring the view. You can also walk to the lower Yosemite falls too. We stayed at The Lodge so we were able to admire the falls quote a bit during our stay :) We took a walk about to view the chapel and surrounding area. It's just breath taking and would highly recommend a visit if you haven't before. ","February 14, 2016",Pictures don't do it justice!,58,"Brisbane, Australia",5
Yosemite Valley,"Among America's great, preserved wildernesses, the range of scenery and geographical diversity found within the boundaries of Yosemite National Park knows no rivals.When the spigots are running, Yosemite boasts at least six waterfalls of world-class renown. But the park's signature emblem of its rugged beauty is the massive wall of rock called Half Dome, over which no water spills, but which never fails to amaze with its massive, exposed granite face that dares the human race to try and surmount it with its ingenuity. And so it's both the immovable object *and* the irresistible force. Once the highlights of the park have been viewed and properly revered, nature's other formations, from pinnacles to canyons to giant sequoias remind you that Yosemite consolidates all of what makes the Sierra Nevada so fiercely wild. If you elect to see it all by auto, the park unveils itself to you one feature after another as you leave Yosemite Valley and ascend its spectacular terrain. One roadside pull-out after another beckons you to gawk -- and perhaps ultimately laugh -- at how staggeringly magnificent nature can be when left to its own devices.But there are, of course, many better ways to enjoy this pristine environment than from a car. Step inside, walk around, have a good look.","February 11, 2016",Nature's greatest hits in one setting,80,"Chicopee, Massachusetts",5

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is the reason there is a national park here, but there is a lot more to Yosemite National Park than the valley. I knew before I came that I would not be able to give this park more than a lick and a promise. I had one full day. This is how I filled that day.I entered Yosemite over Tioga Pass. I actually think the high country around Tioga Pass and through Tuolumne Meadows might turn out to be one of my favorite parts of the park. It features rugged mountains, gem like lakes nestled in various places, forests and wide open meadows. You can also gets glimpses of Yosemite Valley from a different perspective from the Tioga Road. I had originally planned to do a few miles of hiking in this area, but circumstances were against me. It was raining and cold (38 degrees) on Tioga Pass, and I suspect it was snowing a couple hundred feet higher. When I finally got down out of the rain, I ran into considerable smoke from a forest fire (and considerable traffic from fire crews) so I continued on down the road with just a few brief stops.At the base of the Tioga Road, I stopped to take the hike into the Tuolumne Grove of giant sequoyahs. I had to do this. I have seen the coast redwoods several times, but I've not seen their more muscular inland cousins before. The walk to the grove goes down an old carriage road, and then there is a loop trail through the grove itself. This is not a terribly big grove of trees, but it is a grove of BIG trees. Altogether the walk is about three miles. The climb back up to the parking lot is a mite strenuous but not too bad.After that, I went on the south side of Yosemite Valley and up to Glacier Point. The view of Yosemite Valley from Glacier Point is one of the wonders of the world. I cannot think of anything anywhere in my travels that rivals it. Unfortunately, everyone in the world already knows this. I would not have missed this stop for anything, and I spent a fair amount of time there. I was a little sorry to have visited in the fall, since very few of the waterfalls had any water (I think only Nevada Falls and another lower on the same river) but I was able to pick out all the famous landmarks and watch how everything changed as the sun and clouds shifted. I may not ever go back to Glacier Point, simply because the crowd made me itch. I rather prefer my scenery without feeling like I'm in a crowded bus. My biggest complaint, however, was the numerous people who apparently cannot read well posted and frequent signs banning vehicles over a certain length from the upper Glacier Point Road. There were positively huge RVs, some of them pulling trailers or other vehicles, which were wedged into a parking area not meant to hold them. Eehhh!I finished my day in Yosemite Valley. The viewpoints at the entrance to the valley, particularly Tunnel View, are also not to be missed and never to be returned to. I had a hard time getting a photograph of the beautiful valley because of the hordes of people.In the valley itself, however, there was a pleasant surprise. I had not problem finding a parking spot at about the point where you can turn around, halfway up the valley. From there, I spent a couple of very pleasant hours walking up and down beside the river. Yes, there were people there, but it more reminded me of a city park on a weekday instead of Walmart on the day after thanksgiving. I enjoyed the wind in the trees and the ducks on the river and craning my neck up at the towering cliffs all around. I felt something like peace there, which after a couple of the other stops I did not expect.Yosemite is one of the jewels of the national parks. I understand that. I don;t expect the crowds to go away. I hope that next time I am able to visit, if such a time comes, I have several days and can get away into the back country a bit, maybe look down on the valley from some other vantage point. Who knows?","January 25, 2016",Just part of the park,112,"Anchorage, Alaska",5
Yosemite Valley,"This was my wife's and I first visit to Yosemite National Park so we spent a lot of time beforehand researching what to see, where to go and the distances involved. We only had 2 full days (3 overnights) but even in this short time we managed to see most of the main landmarks. The scenery was awesome ! If you are looking to do any of the walks or hikes as well you would need more than two days. We decided to stay outside the Park in Groveland which is about a 25 minute drive from the Park entrance and 3 hours from San Francisco. It's a small, very quaint town which dates back to the gold rush days. We spent the 3 nights there at the Hotel Charlotte which is an excellent small family run hotel full of character. There are several restaurants in the town within walking distance including a saloon across the road - the Iron Door - which is the oldest saloon in California. It was great ! The Hotel Charlotte also has its own restaurant which was first class ! We are so glad we decided to stay in Groveland. On our first day in the Park we drove up to Glacier Point which is 3200 feet above the Yosemite Valley and over 7000 feet above sea level - the views were spectacular ! We could see the main highlights including Half Dome, El Capitan and down to Yosemite Village on the Valley floor. We then drove down to the Village and on the way stopped at the Tunnel View and then at the foot of the amazing vertical rock formation which is El Capitan (it's about 3,000 feet from the base to the top) and also at the foot of the Bridaveil Fall (there was only a trickle of water since it was September !). We visited the Visitor's Centre in the Village which was very interesting. The next day we took the Tioga Road and went as far as the Tuolumne Meadows stopping on the way for a walk round the Tuolumne Grove to see the giant sequoia trees. (We had originally thought of going to Mariposa Grove which we understand is the main place to see the sequoias but it was closed for restoration.) The walk we did took about an hour and it was certainly worth it (it's a fairly steep walk in some parts). There is also a tree there called the Tunnel Tree - it has a huge hole right through the middle of this gigantic tree which you can walk through ! The scenery at some parts on the way to the Tuolumne Meadows is so different to what we had seen the previous day. The colour of the rock formations is almost white and is such a contrast to the other scenery in the Park. The Tuolumne Meadows is another area which is quite different and is well worth seeing. You can easily do this drive including the walk round the Grove and then back to Groveland in one day.If you haven't been before please bear in mind the high altitude you can sometimes be at so you might need to take some warm clothing depending on the time of year.We had an absolutely wonderful time and would love to come back again one day !","January 25, 2016",AN UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE !,76,"Glasgow, Scotland",5
Yosemite Valley,"This is a place worth braving cold and snow for. In winter the valley is gorgeous, with some lakes and rivers freezing up to give you access to various parts of the valley. Though some of the steeper walks and climbs are closed in winter there are many tracks you can still do such as the walks to Mirror Lake and Bridal Veil falls. The scenery is spectacular with views of half dome and El Capitan and at the visitor centre is an interesting short movie on the history of Yosemite National ParkThere are many places to stop for lunch or a quick rest. Only follow the toilets which are marked on the map - some are closed off and are no longer listed on some trails. There is also a free shuttle which will take you on the loop in the area to the various lodges and accommodation sites and the ice skating rink.I would definitely recommend visiting the valley at least once in your lifetime, it is a spectacular place to be in.","January 24, 2016",Beautiful in the winter,26,,5
Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite in my most humble opinion, is the most beautiful, magical, fantastic, awe inspiring, peaceful, amazing place on planet Earth. One of the things I love to do every time I visit (I have been visiting Yosemite for 2 Saturn solar orbits) is to go on a Ranger walk/hike. Every walk I attend I learn and see something new about Yosemite. This week I saw the largest Sequoia in Yosemite Valley and learned it had been planted / not native. (If you want to know, take a Ranger walk). I also learned about the plants the Ahwahneechee gather to make baskets and arrows. The Rangers who lead the hikes come from many backgrounds and have an amazing array of skills and expertise and could not be more dedicated to preserving and teaching everything Yosemite. The hikes/walks are not to be missed.","January 24, 2016",Yosemite's Rangers are amazing,12,"Davis, California",5

As usual, any area with people they will trash it despite trash cans and bear warnings. Volunteers at the visitor info desk were not knowledgeable. Asked about rock climbing, they did not know if you could or not. Did not know if there showers in the park somewhere. My complaint about the park, driving in they had snow chains required. We put ours on, others could buy them at the gate for $70-80 and then pay to have them installed and removed for $30. There was NO SNOW on the road into the valley. We pulled over half way and took the chains off, manufacture warning is to NOT drive on roads without snow. We had been on a 3 month long road trip, one destination was Glacier NP, an employee there gave us bear spray so we still had it.

We went in late May 2015 and stayed in Angels Camp, CA which was kind of haul from Yosemite National Park, however it was a beautiful drive getting there. The weather was perfect! We spent two full days at the park - Half Dome, El Capitan and the Upper/Lower Yosemite Falls are breathtaking. We even met some climbers as they were getting started at El Capitan.On our trip I was on a quest to find/see some bears. We did a lot of hiking down in the park and didn't see any but when we stayed up-top (on the 120) we had a big one pass right in front of the car. Amazing!I plan to go back again though next time, I plan to stay closer to the park - probably Groveland, CA.","January 9, 2016",Amazingly Beautiful!,1,"Phoenix, Arizona",5
Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite valley is awesome!! When you see half dome and el capitan it is amazing!! One of the best sights is right after you go through the tunnel in the valley. You can also see bridal veil falls. Depending on where you go and the time of the year and how much water there is, you can see Yosemite falls, sentinel falls at 2,000 feet and ribbon falls, which is over 1,500 feet tall.

Yosemite Valley,We stayed at the Yosemite RV Resort which is about 20 miles from the visitors center. The RV park was very nice with spacious sites with full hook-ups. The park was spectacular in September as the water falls were all flowing while the summer crowds had not hit yet. Photographic opportunities abound and there are many places to pull over and enjoy a picnic at the foot a giant slab of granite or gentle flowing river.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite - Bill's TripAdvisor ReviewYosemite has something for everyone and something to enjoy every season of the year. The mist trail up to Vernal and Nevada Falls is one of my personal favorites and is best in the late spring/early summer when the rivers are exploding with energy and vitality. Glacier Point has a grand view of the entire valley and Half Dome but the road is closed until about May. If it your first visit to the park, as soon as you can after you arrive, check out the Visitor's Center, the Yosemite Museum and the Valley Floor tour, which is a great way to get an introduction to the park. For the fit, there is nothing so exhilarating and breathtaking as a day hike (from dawn to dusk in the summer when the days are long) to the top of Half Dome, but don't forget to get your permits. Easy hikes such as to the base of Yosemite Falls (the tallest waterfall in North America) and Bridalveil Falls are a must for hikers of all ages and abilities. Then, go over to the Ansel Adams Gallery, whose namesake was a master of photography and one who loved Yosemite like nowhere else on earth.Don’t miss the Mountain Shop in Curry Village even if you are not a rockclimber or cross-country skier. Just go in and browse and soak up some of the vibe of a culture that thrives on high adventure. To get even closer to the action, go to Camp 4 and you may see some world-class mountain climbers getting ready to climb some of the rock faces of this mecca of rockclimbing enthusiasts. Be sure to stop and get a good view of El Capitan, a 3,000+ foot granite monolith, where from spring to fall you will see little dots on the cliff, which are actually rock climbers like the ones you saw in the Mountain Shop or at Camp 4.In the valley, spectacular views are harder to avoid than find. Among them are the Valley View Turnout and Tunnel View, which is one of the most photographed vistas in the world. You will feel like you have just stepped out of your car into a living postcard because you literally have!If you visit from May to September, the Happy Isles Nature Center will enlighten your mind as to the flora and fauna and the incredible rock slides of 1996. There are interactive exhibits for kids of all ages and short nature hikes surrounding the Center. The world famous Ahwahnee Hotel merges the rustic with style and elegance. Of course, it is one of several National Historic Landmarks within the park’s boundaries.When you get tired of seeing all of the spectacular sites, just rent some bikes and take a leisurely ride through the valley. Or, in the summertime, break out your inflatable rafts (or rent some) and float down the Merced River. If you have the time and the roads are open, take the one and a half hour drive northeast of the park to Tuolumne Meadows to experience another slice of this paradise. Take even a short hike if you don’t have the time or experience to go deep into the high country. Even a short hike will give you a taste of a world many people never have or will ever experience.Just south of the park is the Wawona Hotel, which is yet another National Historic Landmark and deservedly so. It is a Victorian style hotel of stunning beauty and charm of a bygone era. In the summer you can join the guests at an open to the public barbeque and picnic on the grass and feel like you have gone into a time warp. The nearby Mariposa Grove of giant Sequoias (closed for a restoration project until 2017) is further evidence of the incredible diversity of natural beauty in the small geography we call Yosemite.Yosemite Valley is only a small part of what is really Yosemite. To get the full view and flavor of this epic eco-resort, you must strap a pack on your back and go into the high country. Backpacking is the best way to do this, if you have the energy and willingness to venture out and away from the hustle bustle of the valley.Whatever you do during your stay at Yosemite, don’t expect to be happy when you drive out of the park towards civilization, traffic jams and a job awaiting you back home. But you will have created some memories you will never, ever forget! And, if you are lucky, you will be blessed to come back again soon.","December 30, 2015",Nature at her finest!,8,"San Clemente, California",5

Yosemite Valley,"If you are an avid camper like myself, Yosemite is the place to be no matter the time of year. Be aware that there are only a few campgrounds open this time of year and be sure to make reservations ahead of time. We stayed at the Upper Pines Campground and enjoyed every minute. This campground is extremely close to The Mist Trail Head. If you are interested - which you should be - walk to camp site #211 and walk through the woods until you hit the road. Continue to walk to your left and the trail head will be over the bridge to your right. The campground was fairly full but the weather was fantastic so that probably explained it. This is also a great centrally located campground and is within walking distance of the market. When I say walking distance I mean about 20 minutes. Also it is an easy five minute drive to Yosemite Falls which is a huge plus. I would suggest this to anyone who loves adventure.","December 29, 2015",Wonderful winter camping experience!,3,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5
Yosemite Valley,"I did the one day tour from SFO ( booked through viator) . Yosemite is very majestic.Sights were awesome with the sights of Bridal veil , Half dome and the valley itself . Once the park is reached there is ' Yosemite Shuttle' which takes you to different pick up points so that you can take your own hiking routes . This was convenient . The tour was okay however I was disappointed with the fact that there was only few hours to spend in the park after reaching there around 1PM . I would suggest to take the one day trips to Yosemite only if you are keen to check the box . I found it a lot unexplored. I would recommend a longer stay in Yosemite definitely more than a day!.There are public transport available to Yosemite , but not very cheap ( YART & AMTRAK ) . The websites have complete info.Earlier I had checked the options to stay in the park - Being a solo traveller I found the options expensive - However seems like camping is a viable option - But read somewhere that the camping spots need to be pre booked and also to get the right spot you need to arrive not too late in the day.","December 28, 2015",One Day is too less,69,"Sydney, Australia",4

Unfortunately I only had time to stay one night in the Valley which was good just to see as a quick stop and view the stunning el Capitan and Half Dome mountains, as a fan of hiking I can't help but feel I missed out by not having time to do any hikes. I will need to come back at some point but even without any hiking, the visit to the Valley was well worth it. having been to the Grand Canyon on the same trip, I was much more impressed with Yosemite which seems more comprehensible on a human scale.

Yosemite Valley,"My friend from Boston and I decided to visit Yosemite last Saturday, and while there are no seasons, (it is open 365 days a year), there is still not as much open in the winter months. Important things to remember when visiting in the winter: -bring chains -warm clothes/change of clothes -change of socks/boots in case they get wet -gloves, hat, scarf, sunglasses -water Yosemite is exactly what you hear, but so much better. Words cannot describe it's beauty, and pictures do not do it justice. We went to Bridalveil Fall, it was incredible, and with water actually flowing, it was so great to see. As a Californian who has been limited because of our drought, it was so great to see the falls going!!! My friend and I walked around, experienced the natural beauty, inhaled the fresh air, and exhaled the negativity from our lives. I stopped and had a sandwich at the deli,and warmed up by the fire inside for a bit. I enjoyed my time in Yosemite, and now that I remember how beautiful it is, I am going to start trying to go more often. Come see our beautiful National Park.

Vast majority of the trees have been burnt past the point of regeneration so they will need replanting. The wildlife is scant at most. And the drought has the falls down to a trickle. But... if you enjoy the beauty of the enormous rocky canyon and can look past the hardships then you can enjoy the experience. Those wanting to hike Vernal falls, it still has some water worth seeing and the hike up with the elevation rise is a doozey you can brag about!

There are some spots that sell chips, drinks, sandwiches and stuff, but truly recommend having the experience of a true picnic!

Bikes can be rented to allow one to get a general layout of the paved area. The guided bus trip is an even easier way to see some of the highlights but this does not give you the feel of Yosemite.

What a great place to get out of the car and just walk, taking many pictures of the scenery - there is almost too much to see - the one way loop road is a great idea.","November 27, 2015",Gorgeous,60,"St. John's, Canada",5

We were advised that in the summer, peak months, the park closes its gates late morning because it reaches capacity! Get there early or wait the off-season.We arrived on Halloween. Campground was still full, but we made reservations. The shuttle service throughout the park is very helpful, hop on hop off as you please. I used the map they provided at the reservations office for the campground. Helped us determine the intensity of the hikes and what was good fit for our family.

Yosemite Valley,Absolutely stunning! I visited in mid November and while it was cold I hiked the nevada falls trail (early) and saw 5 people on the way there. By the time we reached the mist trail again it was very crowded.I walked the vernal falls trail to nevada falls and came back the 'winter route'. The winter route was far more slippery and dangerous from the ice. I thought Mirror Lake was a slight let down - not much water and I was expecting more but it's a nice walk for those who can't manage the strenuous hikes.I can't wait to come back in warmer months to complete more hikes.

Yosemite Valley,"Factual data.Yosemite Valley [jo-SEM-i-ti] (an indian word meaning ”those who kill” (the vertical cliffs)) has the shape of the crest of a breaking wave.The valley is 13 kilometer long from east to west, 1,5 km in average width, thus having an area of 19,5 km².The valley floor is elevated to an altitude of 1.200 meter over ocean level.The vertical walls of the valley rises 900-1.200 meter over the valley floor.The awe-inspiring square-like cliff El Capitan magically rises 1.089 meter from the valley floor, the vertical part being 900 meter, and perhaps 150 meter of scree (debris; seen from a distance the scree is covered by trees) at the foot of El Capitan – at the entrance to the valley to the west.The likewise awesome and beautiful Half Dome rises 1.428 meter from the valley floor, near the close of the valley in the east.33 kilometer westerly of El Capitan you pass the pay-booth of Yosemite ”Big Oak Flat Entrance Station” where you pay 30 dollars (27 Euro, 20 Pound Sterling, 202 Danish kroner) for a 7-day pass.Only visit on ordinary weekdays!With more than 20.000 visitors a day in the high season you will appreciate, that the majority of otherwise two-lane roads in Yosemite Valley nowadays are designated as one-way-streets.Statistic calculation.We have established, that Yosemite Valley is 19,5 km² and holds 20.000 persons. Half of those people occupy perhaps only 5 km². Eliminating zeroes by division.5 km² hold 10.000 persons (we are calculating downwards, so we convert km² into m²):5.000.000 m² hold 10.000 persons (now we eliminate 4 zeroes on each side):500 m² (= 22,5 x 22,5 m) hold 1 person.Ergo: 22,5 meter between every person in a statistic chessboard pattern the size of 5 km².(22,5 x 45 m = 1.000 m² = 31,6 x 31,6 m. Ergo: 31,6 meter between each couple).Our Highlights.My wife and I lodged outside (west) of Yosemite for a couple of days. After having marveled at the many waterfalls and outstandingly distinctive cliffs, we took a tranquil – yet alert – canoe-trip in an inflated rubber-dinghy on the Merced River [mö-SED]. Only once did we pass a cataract of less than 1 meter (almost a vertical waterfall), and since I tried this for the first time, I was very alert. However, the voluminous sides of the rubber-boat prevented any major splash into the inside of the boat – and the rubber-boat just buckled according to the changing angles of the water, leaving ourselves and our cooler-bag in place. At one point we found a green meadow where we ate our packed lunch. The summer temperature invited to a dip in the Merced River. Even my wife took a dip, though normally she only wants to bathe in at least 20 degrees Celcius. Indeed the water was cold, since it had melted in the high Sierras, at Merced Peak (3.576 m), only a short while ago (45 km = 4.30 hours ago, if you calculate the water-speed as 10 km per hour at the meadow). So, the dip was quite short, but very refreshing – and we needed it on this hot day. So now we can call ourselves winter swimmers.Take care: The Merced River looks calm, but it flows relentlesly, so stay very close to the shore while bathing.After a while the boat keeper and his helper appeared in a rubber-dinghy in his capacity as a shepherd and herded us further on to the picking-up area, since we were to arrive for the last return-drive of rubber-boats (and paddlers) for that day.This canoeing we still treasure as a fond memory – together with the sight of El Capitan and Half Dome.","November 19, 2015",Dramatic and beautiful.,102,"Copenhagen, Denmark",5

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite was on our itinerary while visiting SF city. We hired a car early morning and went on to drive to explore this scenic beauty. It was a 4.5 hours long drive from the SF city, as we had taken Hwy 140 instead of Hwy 120. (Tip: One can see a the scenic views if one takes the Hwy 140, instead one may also opt for Hwy 120 to reach a bit early) This time of the season you will find less crowd ase peak its not the peak season. Waterfalls are not that vibrant. Initial 3 hrs was a long stretch and a bit boring. But after crossing the Mariposa junction, the views helped us in rejuvinating the energy and get some clicks. After entering the valley, we started exploring the valley on our own. Got some cold sandwiches from Degnan Deli, as Village Grill was closed for the season. There are free shuttles that take you around the valley. We took the shuttle and did a small trek to Mirror Lake. Unfortunately there was not much water, so we couldn't find any mirror like image :(. We were there only for a day trip, but would suggest to stay there to actually enjoy the place.There is a lot more to do here, but one needs to see the season worth visiting if one wants to see the big waterfalls or go to the Glacier Point.All in all, its a must see option :)","November 5, 2015",Beauty at its best!,4,,4

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is truly a jewel of our national parks system. I had procrastinated on planning a trip to the park because of the negative press I had read regarding the crowds and traffic. My solution was to make a visit in the ""off season"". What I learned is that Yosemite doesn't really have an off season. It's open year round and their are things to do all year.We were their in mid Oct. The campgrounds were still mostly full and there was still average vehicle traffic. I would not have wanted to have be there if the visitor count was much higher. I was told that the Oct crowds were nowhere close to the crush they experience in the summer.The one negative about this time of year is the absence of the falls. Most are dry this time of year. And the prolonged Calif. drought hasn't helped. Bridal Veil Falls had slowed to a whispering trickle. Mirror Lake was totally dry. We actually walked across the lake bed while on a hike. Also, we had wanted to hike the back side of Half Dome. The weather was still good for it but we were told the cables had already been removed for the year.

Yosemite Valley,"We've been going to Yosemite every year for the past 15 years and it seems like we're discovering new places and things to do every time.

Yosemite Valley,"It was hard to enjoy Yosemite Valley, after sitting in traffic for 2 hours, getting from one end of the valley to the other. Also, the restrooms were really disgusting and smelled awful. With the number of visitors, they really needed to have a dedicated employee in each restroom just to keep them clean.Yosemite Valley itself is stunning, and the hikes we did were wonderful. But the last thing I want to do in a national park is sit in traffic. I plan to go back during a less-busy time of year, and I'm sure my review will be 5 stars.There is a grocery/souvenir/convenience store in the valley that has pretty much everything you could need - that is very convenient!","October 26, 2015",Sooooo crowded,9,"Dallas, Texas",2
Yosemite Valley,"It is unfortunate that such a lovely state park does not allow dogs on the main trails. I live in Fresno, a quick drive away, and own a dog that loves to go hiking. Unfortunately we are not able to bring her with us to Yosemite as she is only allowed on the paved flat walk ways. I understand that this is a national park rule, but find it ridiculous that people cannot be trusted to have their dogs on the trails.I do not recommend bringing your dog it you plan on doing anything more than strolling along the valley floor.

Yosemite Valley,"We were looking forward to this park so much... We reserved one day for the park. Well, where to start. We were comming from White Chief Mountain Lodge Hotel and opted to visit the Glacier point first. While driving, it smelled like burned everywhere, you could even taste it on your langque how it was dense the smoke. Reaching GP, it was foggy everywhere to such an extend that WE SEE NOTHING of the valley bellow us, nor of the famous Yosemity scenery. I have no idea what happened but if it was because the rangers were burning the forest, well thanks a lot guys - you completely ruined our whole day in Yosemite! Ok, deeply disappointed, we left heading for the Valley. Well, here we entered a big jam slowly moving towards the end of the valley and searching for places to park. The valley was packed by cars and people and this was definitely my worst day at the West Coast. SO HERE ARE MY TIPS:>>> 1/ If you smell smoke, no point to spend 2 hours of driving up to the Glacier Point!>>> 2/ Use the SHUTTLE BUS to enter the valley - the bus has his dedicated line and goes fast in contrary to the cars standing in the neverending stream trying to move or find a spot to park.I am submitting some photos to illustrate you how smoky - white our 'view' was..","October 26, 2015","Smoky, smelly, crowded...",20,"Antibes, France",3

The beautiful Merced River running through with spectacular, round boulders offers running water through tall trees.The majestic rock faces towering over the valley interrupt the sky and make you ponder your place in the world.The trees, deer, and scurrying rodents illustrate how life survives in a relatively harsh climate. And the ravens and Stellar's jays add a touch of humor.You can camp, or lodge, or canvas lodge to spend the night; which I'd highly recommend.

Waterfall was completely dry, that was just heartbreaking to see.

We visited the Mariposa Grove and the Sequoias were AMAZING. They were huge and took your breath away. The next day we started at the park entrance and drove all the way to the top stopping at Glacier Point and several other scenic overlooks. We saw Half Dome, the valley below, Royal Arches, Upper and Lower Yosemite Falls, North Dome, Yosemite Valley, Bridal Veil Falls, El Capitan and much more. It took the full day to go from the top down into the valley and then back out. The evidence of forest fires was everywhere and so sad. One word of warning, the roads are very, very narrow and at times you are close to the edge and there is nothing to keep you from going over the side of the mountain so drive slow and if you are the passenger, closing your eyes at times is advised! But the views are incredible and this is a not to miss attraction! We were there in May and it snowed the next day. They close the park if it snows and the roads are bad - for obvious reason so there really is a small window during the Summer when you can access the park.","October 19, 2015",Fantastic National Park,132,"Springfield, Virginia",5

Yosemite Valley,"The many beautiful published photos of Yosemite led me to put it on my ""bucket list"" of places to see in the US. Like many places of true beauty, photos simply cannot do it justice. The pure majesty of the scenery in this park will take your breath away. From the time you enter the park, you are struck by the beauty of the forest, the views, the wildlife (I did see a baby bear crossing the road, as well as deer along the road). The other thing that occurred to me during the days I visited this park was what a lot of work must have gone into even building those many roads through the park. They are in great shape, and although they are narrow in many places and you do have to go slow, I never felt as if the roads posed any danger to the driver. On this trip, I had also been hiking in Sedona for several days, and in the Grand Canyon. I was awed by both of them, but Yosemite was my favorite. The rock formations, forest, wildlife, hiking trails, waterfalls, lakes, rivers/streams of this park are beyond beautiful. Some of the hikes are difficult, but well worth the effort. Even though Yosemite Falls was dry at this time of year, the Upper Yosemite Falls hike was spectacular.Definitely take a camera and capture as much of the beauty as you can, but the best pictures will be those in your mind.","October 18, 2015",Stunning scenery,82,"Carrollton, Texas",5
Yosemite Valley,"Visited Yosemite Valley and hiked around the valley floor. Beautiful scenery, fantastic trails and best of all we spotted a Mule deer on the track. As we were photographing the deer another came over to us from across the road. They were obviously used to the tourists and gave us some fantastic photo opportunities. The valley floor trail was the easiest, it was still a challenging hike but plenty of opportunities to sit and take in the spectacular views and there are a few restrooms along the route.","October 17, 2015",Great for hiking,20,"Reading, England, United Kingdom",5
Yosemite Valley,"Having to change our plans to spend the day in San Francisco because of the 1M + people there for Fleet Week, we chose to drive to Yosemite. Usually being planners and knowing everything before we go, we really didn't have any significant expectations. However, 12 miles into the Yosemite Valley and coming around a curve and seeing Half Dome was just stunning! And then following the road you come upon El Capitan. Just stunning. Words cannot describe how breathtaking it is and how beautiful the Yosemite Valley is overall. This was well worth the $30 admission fee! Yosemite Village is well designed and easy to walk around. The Ansel Adams gallery allows you to view his beautiful photographs but don't spend your time inside when you can just walk outside and see the real thing!Parking was fairly easy to find. The Village Deli food is reasonably priced and actually very tasty. The Yosemite shuttle is convenient and runs every few minutes around the Village and on a schedule around the valley. The ride from San Francisco is about 120 miles but about 3 and a half hours due to the twisty, turning road that is white knuckle at some times but totally worth the time. If you are going for one day plan to leave the park while it is still light out as you get through the turning section of the road as it has no lights and no guardrails. Of course, because we didn't plan we didn't know that there are lodges in the park but it seems they are booked well in advance anyway. For reference, we were there on October 10 and although we saw where the Yosemite Falls are, there was no water flowing this time of the year.

Yosemite Valley,I have visited Yosemite Valley several times & have always enjoyed it. Once a visitor parks their car they will have to use the park service transit to get about. The park can be hot in the summer and quite cold in the winter. Visitors should stay clear of the bears as they are not tame. The falls are very dangerous & visitors should never get in the water near waterfalls or when the rivers are at flood stage. Rocks are slippery & even a few inches of water can wash a person off of their feet. Every year there are casualties. I recommend lunch or breakfast at the Awahnee Hotel in the park.

The etrance fee is 30 dollars per car and no charge for passangers in the car. Keep the ticket, they will ask when you are exiting. If you are coming from San Francisco or from western entrance towards the valley there will be a tunnel as sson as you leave the tunnel prepare to stop to see the grand view of the Valley. This point is called Tunnel View ( route 41). Check the panels and see the names of the mountains in front of you. Then proceed towards the Yosemite Visitor centre in order to park your car. Then take the free of charge shuttle for the tour in the valley. 21 stops and you can depart the bus whereever you like. There is a shuttle every 10 minutes. You can not drive in the valley because most of the roads are reserved for the shuttle. Actually there is not much to see on the route of the shuttle but it only takes 1 hour. Try to take photos while you are approaching the valley, where ever you find a parking. We took the road from the eastern side Lee Vining entrance and made a big loop around the park.

Yosemite Valley,"Have been to Yosemite multiple times in my life and every time I am stunned by the beauty and majesty of this land. This year we made a camping excursion, staying at Wawona the first night, then two nights at Lower Pines, and then a night at Upper Pines. All three were great. Lower Pines had a close walk to incredible views of the granite wonders. A bit busier than the other two, and an RV next to us ran his generator during appropriate hours, thus gassing us with diesel fumes during our first dinner. After that we timed our outings! Upper Pines turned out to be the best. We had a spot (232 or 238) that was far from the bustle of the valley and absolutely peaceful and gorgeous. Next trip we will stay there again. We also checked out North Pines, but found that other reviews were accurate in that the stables have a ripe odor which is detectable in much of the North Pines sites. North Pines is also more dense, darker, and not as pleasant as the other two. We took our two dogs and found that, although they are not allowed on the wilderness trails, there were plenty of awesome walks where pets are allowed. If you've never been, it's time to go. You will find both the Valley and Glacier Point to be worth all of you effort in getting there. Best wishes.","October 12, 2015",Stunning every time,23,Monterey County,5

Plenty of places to eat or get a drink. You can only be in awe of this place lots of walking tracks to take up to Glacier point or mirror lake and views that beggar belief. This was just a trial trip for when we go back and stay longer to do Half Dome. Place is very well organised and during the day there a a coach that will take you to all the different places on the valley floor ( runs every half hour ).

We love the outdoors and we come to camp and just be in place bigger than life itself. Great to relax & get away from the everyday city life, the cell phones, emails, traffic, etc. We normally stay in Upper Pines campground which is tucked in on the upper eastside of the valley. I believe it's more on the quieter side of the campgrounds and less crowded because the sites seem to be a bit more spaced apart so you get a bit more privacy. They've recently added filtered water stations at all restroom locations as well as at the hotels & villages which is very convenient. The shuttle system is the best way to get threw the valley floor and even during certain times of the year they will travel up to Glacier Point.

We would not recommend waiting for the shuttle bus - busses are often full and do not let you enter and you can easily walk the short distances on flat ground. We did among others the mirror lake trail which was not enjoyable, there are two roads, one an asphalt street where you have to watch out as you are encircled by hordes of speeding bycicles, the other one a natural trail plastert with steaming and smelling horse droppings, you have to concentrate highly if you want to avoid stepping inside. The famous mirror lake was not to be found in September, we as most people were not aware that it had turned to a sandpit and a small mud swamp. The famous mountains were also not clear visible due to the fires going on, which we certainly understand.

I suspect this may be more difficult to achieve in the Summer. The main road around the valley is one way and there are plenty of opportunities to park up and take small hikes either down to the river or into the woods - well worth doing rather than just staying in the car.There is a free shuttle bus going round the valley floor which goes on to some roads which you can't access yourself by car so it will allow you to get much closer to the base of Half Dome for example.,"October 4, 2015",Fabulous!,555,"Kingston-upon-Hull, United Kingdom",5

The main visistor centre should be a show case but it is inadequate for the vast numbers of people who go to share in this magical area. The car parks are a long way from the centre, the signing is poor and there is no-one around to help. Clearly the park authorities don't want visitors to eat as there are no stop off places other than a few main spots. Maybe they don't want to commercialise the Park but they should cater for the needs of visitors and make a buck or two in the process. The loos are consistently dreadful and foul and no-one is looking after them. The car parks at various stops are far too mean and there aren't enough tables and benches for those with picnics to eat at. You buy a seven day pass which is fine but wouldn't it be sensible to have two lines at the entrances with one for those with passes and the other for those who need to purchase one? We got the impression that the the staff weren't interested and there must be a leadership problem. Well I would say to those responsible a. Get a grip and b.

By the end of the day, the muscles I use to gawk had atrophied; my camera lens was complaining of cramp; yet I was reluctant to leave. When we did leave, the only part of me that went quietly were my lymph nodes. And today I am only plagued by a myriad of stunning photographs and memories that will last a lifetime.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is packed with people, even after Labor Day. There is not much real estate for all the people to spread out, so there is a large concentration of visitors in one small area. The parking lots begin to fill up early, especially the lot for the Mist Trailhead to Vernal Falls, Nevada Falls, and Half Dome. Unless you pay heavily, or camp in a tent, finding lodging is very difficult. The closest lodging not in Yosemite is in El Portal. For us, those rooms were all sold out so we ended up finding a bed and breakfast near Mariposa. My take on Yosemite Valley is that unless you are a hiker, most of Yosemite Valley can be easily viewed in one day. My choice next time would be to take the first parking spot available, then ride the shuttle busses from stop-to-stop. Because we were in Yosemite in the fall, Yosemite Falls was dried up. Bridalveil Falls had been dried up but an overnight rain storm had started it flowing with just a wisp. The visitor center was a disappointment. It was crowded and didn't seem to provide a lot of information. This negative review is not to say I did not like Yosemite National Park. I like it because I would consider Yosemite to be a hiker's park/haven. I hiked several trails of varying difficulty and enjoyed all but the very easiest one. Hikes we did included the Mist Trail up to Vernal Falls and to the top of Nevada Falls then back down the Muir Trail. We also hiked the 4 Mile Trail up to Glacier Point. Another hike we did was to Sentinal Dome. But, if you are not a hiker, climber, or backpacker, then I believe Yosemite Valley can easily be ""done"" in a day. Score without hikes 3.

This is a somewhat short but challenging hike due to the steep incline. The footbridge yields a nice view of Vernal Falls, although again at this time of year, the water flow was minimal. I would highly recommend the drive to Glacier Point to get an awesome birds-eye view of the valley. Also, the shuttle system provides a nice way to get around to the various points of interest within the valley. Must admit that we were very surprised by the number of folks who were in the park on a September Wednesday. It was a bit crowded.","September 29, 2015",Beautiful Park - But Crowded,36,"Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania",4
Yosemite Valley,"We visited the park a couple times and it is breathtaking. Beautiful scenery, falls and hiking trails that keep you busy for a couple days. We drove in from San Francisco as from Las Vegas and both drives are beautiful. In 2013 we had the bad luck that a wildfire prevented us from taking the Tioga Pass into the park and forced us to drive all the way around the park by taking route 108. A nice route but it did cost us a lot time. The weather was always good except in 2013 as the wildfire caused a lot of smoke and ashes. At night it looked like it was snowing caused by the ashes that came down into the camp where we stayed at. Unfortunately this was the trip that we had planned to hike down from Glacier Point back into the Valley. Even with the smoke the hike was breathtaking. The path is great to hike and it took us 3 hours and 12 minutes to get back to Curry Village were we slept at the Curry Village cabins. Even the smell of the smoke added something special and unforgettable to our trip. All the other times the smell of the fresh pines stayed in our mind forever. We never had the luck to see a bear but I know many stories of people that did. If you love nature, wildlife and beautiful scenery, this is the park to be. Spend at least 2 or 3 days as there’s so much to see and do. Before I only knew the park from movies and it was very special to see it by myself. Travel Tip: When you are planning just a day visit while driving from San Francisco towards Las Vegas, spend the night in Mammoth Lakes. If you drive the other way around It’s very nice to spend the night in Death Valley. Unfortunately by visiting just one day you won’t be able to do any hiking trails. But all the sights as Glacier Point, Half Dome, El Capitan, Yosemite Falls are easy to see and visit by car.","September 29, 2015",Personal Nr.1 National Park in the USA,29,"Maaseik, Belgium",5

I avoid popular hikes/walks during mid-morning to the mid-afernoon, and I am able to enjoy the sights with less people. Gorgeous hikes in Tuolumne meadows during all seasons.

I'd like to give Kudos to the US Post office here- very helpful staff and if you have any stamp collecting family/friends they do have historic stamps available for sale and they will hand cancel them for you! I purchased some commemorative envelopes and added history stamps from the 30's and the staff was so very helpful to ensure the beautiful hand cancelled stamps arrived to family members.

Since there are many attractions close to the valley, I highly recommend to stay in the park in the valley for at least a couple nights for convenience. We stayed in an awesome resort outside the park, but it took us almost an hour to get there from the Valley.

Yosemite Valley,"Sentinel Dome, Taft Point, Glacier Point... even driving through the park to get there was absolutely breathtaking. The entire park has an energy to it, warm and refreshing. I could stay there forever... if I knew how to properly camp. The first time I went, I asked a ranger for some suggestions on things to see and do and the dude was very unhelpful. It kinda sucked, and while the Tuolumne Meadow region is beautiful, it's not what you'd call an ""exciting"" hike. The ranger could have told me that, but as I said, he was pretty unhelpful, thinking it best I make the decision on my own. The second time was much much more positive. A different ranger spent 15 minutes talking to me about various trails, asking me questions, and giving me several different choices for hiking and camping. Incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. That's how I got to Sentinel Dome, Taft Point, and Glacier Point (at sunset no less). Of the dozen or so national parks I've visited, Yosemite is by far my favorite. I hope to get back there for more trips in the future and highly recommend it to anyone who likes hiking and nature.","September 27, 2015","Natural beauty, natural refreshment, just... awesome.",2,"Baltimore, Maryland",4

Had lunch at the big hotel there which was a bit pricey but good. We sat outside so we could continue to enjoy the scenery.

I would suggest booking early as i overheard some that had booked a year in advance. a few tips. to go the valley, glacier point and make sure you have plenty of gas before you get close to Yosemite.

Yosemite Valley,"While Yosemite Valley is just a small part of the mammoth National Park, this is the heart of the activity for those just sampling the park as we did, and those who are staying long-term or passing through on long hikes. Visiting in summer was spectacular, I can only imagine a spring vacation here with all the falls running. (Only three are visible in the summer - and the tallest in North America is dry for much of the year). It is surprising that there are very nice river beaches where you can wade and swim during the summer. There are also hikes to see the three running falls - a short hike to Bridal Veil, a medium hike to look up at the two other year-round falls, and a long hike up the mountainside to visit these falls. Walking to Mirror Lake, even though it is now just a meadow where 19th and 20th Century Americans created an artificial basin, is a very good way to see an alternative view of Half Dome, the Valley's most famous feature. The rocks that have fallen from the surrounding cliffs show how the Valley is still being created, more quickly than can be imagined. The pizza restaurant in the Village is sure to be a pleasant respite for young children and teenagers. It stays open longer than the other deli-like places and the pizza is very good.","September 18, 2015",Heart of Yosemite,7,"Christiansburg, Virginia",5
Yosemite Valley,"We drove in to Yosemite from our accommodation at Oakhurst (about an hour's drive), and were awestruck from our first sighting of Yosemite Valley till the last. Coming through the tunnel, we stopped to admire the brilliant view of El Capitan.We arrived at the Village before the cafes opened (11am - not sure whether this was Autumn hours, or every day). Grabbing a cheap coffee from the grocery store, we checked out the famed wilderness photographer Ansel Adams gallery and then hopped aboard the park's shuttle bus to the start of the Mist Trail.It was a holiday weekend and there were a lot of people in the park enjoying the brilliant weather. The Mist Trail leads to two waterfalls - Vernal Falls which is 1000 feet climb, and Nevada Falls, which is another 900 feet higher. The walk is listed as 'strenuous' and I concur, although it was only a 4.8km round trip. There were 600 steps to ease the climb, but the path was narrow in places, and it was necessary to stop and give way to other hikers. It was a beautiful hike, with views of the surrounding peaks (Half Dome) and through the valleys. Towering pines and impressive boulders, well made path and a rest stop with facilities are all features. The falls themselves were worth the walk, and would be absolutely breathtaking with more water cascading over in Spring.","September 17, 2015",Hiking the Mist Trail,13,,5

Yosemite Valley,"We went to Yosemite Valley on a Saturday afternoon in summer and it was packed full of people. It was very difficult to find a parking space once we finally managed to get to the valley. However, we had such a good time! The views were fantastic, pictures do not do them justice. I recommend to go early in the morning on a weekday so it's quieter, and also to not try the medium + high difficulty trails in the summer as the California heat makes them an awful lot harder, especially if you're not used to the climate. Mirror lake was a personal favourite and an easy hike, make sure you go there!","September 12, 2015","Amazing views and great trails, but extremely busy",18,"Preston, United Kingdom",4
Yosemite Valley,"Decided not to add two hours to the journey to go through the Wawona tunnel for the iconic view of Yosemite. Did take a tour the following day and this was one of the stops!

Yosemite Valley,"For nature, wildlife and geology lovers, this valley is a blast. I went there in April, when there is still snow in the high elevations, but enough melting to keep the waterfalls running. The valley is walled by impressive, high, massive granite mountains. The pine trees smell is intoxicating. I am not a hiker but just driving and taking pictures inside the valley was an unforgettable experience for me.","September 12, 2015",Amazing,7,"Sao Paulo, SP",5
Yosemite Valley,"Beautiful, full of wildlife, unbelievably awesome. Facilities basic and quite expensive - set up to make money rather than provide a meaningful service.Rent a bike and cycle the few miles it takes to get all the best views.If you are ever in California this is a must see destination.","September 12, 2015",The most spectacular place on earth,169,Barbados,5
Yosemite Valley,"We set off with high expectations to experience the world's most beautiful mountain terrain within the 1,170 sq. miles of Yosemite. As only a tiny fraction of the hoards that descend upon the park each year we were not in the least put off by large crowds as it is so big and accommodating. Sadly the waterfalls were dry in August but the awe-inspiring panoramic scenes kept coming at us throughout the day.To be met almost at first by El Capitan at the western entrance to the valley it being the worlds largest exposed rock. took our breath away, as did so much more.Half Dome, Yosemite Falls, Vernal Nevada Falls, Glacier Point, Mariposa Grove, Tunnel View and Tuolumne Meadows are just waiting to be seen and admired. Look them all up before going and prioritise your visit(s) you will not be disappointed.All in all a perfect day and the best of our 2 week holiday. We are going back for more.Parking, a lot of it, was well catered for and options of on-of buses are on offer. Lots of picnic places are provided throughout, gift shops washrooms etc. all again well catered for.DONT MISS IT.","September 10, 2015",Wow,235,"Barton-upon-Humber, United Kingdom",5
Yosemite Valley,"Arriving by coach we were allowed an afternoon to stroll through the parkland at Yosemite. The woodland trees were so calming after our journey. We saw cheeky squirrels and blue jays as we ate our picnic lunch. Unfortunately because of the season we were disappointed not to see the waterfall which was completely dry, as was the river at the bottom. It's a beautiful area not to be missed.","September 10, 2015",Tranquil grandeur,57,Ormskirk,5

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite is one of the top U.S. park destinations for a reason. It is a beautiful place with so many outdoor activities to do. Hiking options for all levels abound.The visitor center in the valley is very nice as is the nearby Ansel Adams gallery and store. We were there on the Labor Day weekend so traffic getting out of the valley was pretty slow. Once past the 3-4 cut outs for other places to park, we were free and clear and had no issues. Patience is a virtue at times.We took the walk/hike to Mirror Lake after parking our car in a very crowded Curry Campground parking lot. Round trip with all of our side trips was about 7 miles, but elevation changes were minimal so it was actually not too strenuous. Take plenty of water though.At this time of the year and combined with the drought conditions some of Yosemite's best sights are not in evidence. Yosemite Falls was dry for instance as was Mirror Lake. However, the beautiful surrounding mountains and granite rick faces are amazing.Well worth the trip in to the valley.","September 7, 2015",Stunning scenery all around you,198,"Northville, Michigan",5

Yosemite Valley,"There is a reason that SO many people flock to Yosemite: it is truly awe-inspiring. We walked from the visitor centre to Mirror Lake, and immediately you reach the destination you are straightway immersed into the Ansell Adams image which is so redolent of the national park. Everywhere you look, the granite walls rise out of the valley and dwarf the giant redwoods that populate the valley floor. Despite the large number of people, as soon as you get even a few hundred yards from the visitor centre, the populace dwindles and you bump into the occasional hiker or horse-back rider or cyclist. So, yes, you're in touristville, but you can escape easily. Our kids also sat through the ranger show, and loved it, even getting a photo with Ranger Dan and his side-kick at the end :-) All in all, a highlight of our holiday, though don't expect to hike far with little kids as it is HOT in the summer - close to 100 degrees F. Carry water!","September 6, 2015","Quite remarkable, quite unique, quite awe-inspiring",121,"London, United Kingdom",5

Yosemite Valley,"It really is a beautiful place. What impressed us the most was the magnificence and the enormity of the surrounding mountains.We only had time to stop for 1 night but I'd want to come back here for at least 3-4 days. I'd recommend spending time just ambling around the Valley, going for walks/hikes, walking through the meadows, swim in the river.A drive away from the Valley itself, I'd want to visit Glacier Point, Tuolumne Grove (Mariposa Grove closed until Spring 2017), Olmsted Point, Tuolumne Meadows.","September 5, 2015",Stunning beauty,59,"London, United Kingdom",5
Yosemite Valley,"we spent over two days (two nights stay) and barely scratched the surface of the places to visit. It was very hot 90F/30C+ and the effects of the prolonged drought across California were very evident. We got up VERY early to see the early sun hit the mountains around Bridalveil Falls, and there was only a bit of spray descending rather than the sheet of water shown in all the photos. Definitely worth getting to the valley before the rush. We booked on the 11am valley 2 hr tour - a very worthwhile attraction - and didn't have a problem booking. Used the free buses around the valley. We trekked to Vernal Falls late afternoon, a strenuous walk of about an hour. watch out that the light drops quickly in the evening. On the journey back to San Francisco, we stopped at the Sequoia groves and here's a good downhill walk to see the Tunnel tree and the other massive redwoods, but the penalty is in the uphill return.

Yosemite Valley,"I've been fortunate to have seen many stunning vistas in several countries. Even with little water (drought) the scenery is breath taking. I can only imagine how good it must look during winter with snow on the ground. The navigation in the park can be a little tricky as there is not much clear signage, and the maps are not that clear. However, we found if you keep following the traffic you will likely get to the main attractions. Ours was a day trip from our base at Tenaya Lodge, which is only a short drive away. If we had more time we would love to stay longer in the park. Entry fee was $30 for a car and allows 7 days of access.Mobile/cell phones do not have coverage in many areas of the park. There is plenty of food etc in the valley shops. I do suggest you take plenty of drinks with you as it can bet thirsty work. Fuel is also available in the valley but you pay a bit more for it.","September 3, 2015",What a pleasure,20,"Melbourne, Australia",4

Yosemite Valley,"From the dominating presence of El Capitan to the shy deer that roam the valley floor Yosemite always delivers a different view at every turn. The easy walk up to Mirror Lakemakes it available to everyone, but the smaller rough trail that runs almost parallel on the other side of the valley floor makes you feel like the explorers who first came across this magnificent vista. There are great views of the valley from all the entrance roads but a trip up to Glacier Point, to see everything laid out in front of you, is a must.","September 2, 2015",Never fails to astound the senses,10,United Kingdom,5

I also would recommend to stay close to the main entrance of the park (close to the valley) and to be prepared to do the trails!!!!You have some information centers where they give you maps with details regarding the trails, also they have sings along the trail making hard to get lost! =)I believe 3 full days is enough to see the main important attractions.You pay 30 dollars for 7 days per car to be able to get in the park.","September 1, 2015",Awesome,2,"Orlando, Florida",5

Hiking up Half Dome was on my bucket list. It was simply worth the strenuous hike. Reading through the one star ratings, just consider the source. Considering there's more five star ratings, says a lot. Of course summer is going to be busy! It's summer and people go vacationing in summer. Yosemite in the Fall is absolutely stunning! There is Fall foliage. Just simply beautiful. Yosemite is so big! You simply can't experience all of it in one trip. There are so many hikes and so many areas worth backpacking. I have yet to see Yosemite in the Winter and Spring. Looking forward to it. ","September 1, 2015",Amazing! ,1,,5

Yosemite Valley,The Yosemite Valley walk can be as long or short as you wish and will provide many sensational views of the various sites in Yosemite from El Capitan to Half Dome. The valley floor has many great vistas as well. We took daily walks across the valley floor and each time of day provides a visual treat. Reviews that path and begin.

You can camp here in the designated camping areas with hundreds of other people, in cleared areas near the roadside. 24 hour services, pizza and other restaurants, supermarkets a heated swimming pool, bar, reception and so on. I'm sure that would appeal to some people, mainly families, but it seems wrong and ott in a park designated as a celebration of nature. Some of the views here of half dome and El Capitan are great, don't get me wrong, but I certainly don't see the point in camping or spending much time here when there's a whole park out there with more nature and better views","August 30, 2015",Way too commercial for a natural 'park',23,"Aberdeen, United Kingdom",2

Amazing views, good hiking - we just did the short trails - a couple of miles max. Based on the recommendation of ""Ranger Adam"" I encourage all visitors to read the book, ""Wild Muir"".

Large buses handle the crowds and move visitors about the valley to the various sites. It's a tourist attraction, but much more. It is impossible to appreciate the grandeur of this spot without standing in the valley hearing the sounds of flowing water and of leaves crunching underfoot as you walk about the trails. To feel the ache in your neck as you tire from straining to look upon the rock walls and outcrops above you. It was dry when we visited, but water was still present - lucky for us and the wildlife in the park. See this place. You won't be disappointed. Would I do this again? No. Was it worth it to do it once? Absolutely. ","August 28, 2015",Bucket list visit - check,33,"Tallahassee, FL",5

The shuttle is fine is you are going to hike for the day and just want to get to that location. But not a good option to see a lot of things, the shuttle is really three different buses not really for sightseeing just people moving, they get crowded and its standing room only at times. Meanwhile people seem to just drive around and pull over for a phototour, I wish we had done that.

Unfortunately, we only had one day in the park. The smoke from the fires in the park and in California produced poor visibility and air quality. The drought has dried up most of the rivers and falls. We definitely will return someday when conditions improve.","August 26, 2015",Majestic scenery two hour drive from park entry,319,"Sugar Land, Texas",5

Gorgeous views, but hikes packed with other people. I think you have to see this part of the park too, but Tioga pass and Glacier point road hikes were much less crowded on fri and Saturday. We did the lower vernal falls hike and bridal veil falls. Only flowing waterfalls in August are vernal and Nevada falls. Great views from the valley floor looking up as well.

Yosemite Valley,A truly stunning place. Some amazing scenery and incredible walks right out of the valley floor. Take the hike up to Yosemite Falls. You will find it is less touristy than down at the foot of the falls and there are stunning views. We did the four mile trek down from Glacier Point. Bit disappointing as its just a slog. Great views but you are so busy concentrating on zig-zagging your way down you don't take them in too well. We didn't do the Panoramic Trail and wished we had. The views are much better from that trail and it takes in two beautiful waterfalls.,"August 26, 2015",Breathtaking scenery,99,"Southampton, United Kingdom",5

The truly awe inspiring sites are--Bridal veil-- its watery chasm is spectacularHalf Dome-- a millennia ago it was once a solid dome and now it is but half, at sunset it emits a blush of pink on the flat side.Three brothers--- a three tiered sloping mountain formation as if three boys were playing leap frog.El capitan-- a huge perpendicular monolith suited for climbingRibbon falls--water streams trickling down the cliff sidesHappy isles-- a fun area for a walk aboutMirror lake-- an actively receding pond of ice cold glacier watersMerced river-- even now the swift, speeding flow of its waters is a joyful memory Mariposa woods-- an area of giant sequoia trees and as its name suggest floating butterfliesVernal mist trail-- a hiking path to reach the vertical water fallYosemite meadow-- a golden grassland pasture and a lovely 1880's simple steeple of a red wood chapel in the meadowlandAwahnee-- a traditional yet modern lodge and fine dining facilities beneath an immense chandelier We chose to stay in a rustic cabin near a mountain that gave us a wonderful view of tree shadows, the full moon and owls in flight.A system of bus trams are the sole means of transport in the park and make everything easy to get around.Awesome Yosemite is incomparable and might just be the loveliest of ALL the national parks.Vernal","August 25, 2015",Awesome Yosemite,75,"Los Angeles, California",5

Yosemite Valley,"This is a place of indescribable natural beauty. We took about 5 hours to drive from San Francisco over to Yosemite ( we went pass Yosemite snd stopped at Applebees in Sonora for lunch and to buy fresh fruit and yogurts at the grocery store). It was worth the drive. We entered through Big Oak Flat road and took highway 120 to travel across Tioga Road to Tioga Pass en route to Mammoth Lakes. Please note carefully, this area is prone to fires in summer if you do this and see dark smoke billowing in the distance turn around immediately. We were 1 hour away from exiting through Tioga Pass to Mammoth Lakes when the park rangers closed the road as the smoke we saw in the distance had grown larger and engulfed the road. What began as a lovely trip started to become scary as so many vehicles had to U turn around 5:30 pm and drive 2.5 hours back to the entrance at Big Oak Flat road and another 1.5 hours to go through the steep winding S bend roads of the Chinese camp area with the sun setting around 8 pm. We had to circumvent the fire and drive for about 7.5 hours to reach Mammoth Lakes via Sonora Pass in the dark. If we had seen Sonora Pass during the day we definitely would not have driven there during the night as it is steeper than going through the Chinese camp and Tioga road. Thank God for the Starbucks in Sonora which was still open where my hubby could get his triple shot espresso and I my Mint Majesty large tea and download the route to Sonora Pass as we kept losing phone signals.

Vernal Falls hike was beautiful but strenuous. Yosemite Falls (lower) are easy to reach though nearly dry this time of year (especially with drought conditions!). Mariposa Grove is closed until 2017, but rangers were STRONGLY discouraging visits to the smaller redwood groves in an effort to protect them.

There are a few places to eat in the village and a store if you want to grab food for a picnic. But the scenery is the main thing and it's spectacular. We walked up to Mirror Lake – sadly little water but a great location near Half Done. Likewise Lower Yosemite Falls – hardly any water in August. The walks were easy and accessible and the views are great wherever you look. Great wildlife too – plenty of birds, deer, and we saw a bobcat twice. Sadly no bears though.

When entering the Park from the East and traversing it towards the West, you see some amazing sights (mountains, streams, valleys, peaks, etc...). The Porcupine Creek Trail offers a great nature walk (with a lot of up and down hills, especially leaving and returning from the parking area). You'll hike an established trail through the forest that really is a beautiful take...

The waterfalls are a bit puny, but we knew they would not be great this time of year. And they are letting mirror lake go back to its original state, so there is no lake any more. We also knew it was going to be crowded. But I do have a couple complaints, 1. the maps for the bus routs are confusing and the busses are not marked very well. There are two bus routs and a bus that only goes to the parking lot and every one kept getting on it and then having to get off. 2 if the trail says moderate its more than moderate.

The Yosemite National Park is fantastic and has excellent resources for planning your trip especially walking/hiking trails, that are rated from easy to hard. We used this web site to plan two walks to waterfalls, so impressive! Good footwear is essential even for the easy walks.Parking at these two sites was limited. The area is very busy in the summer months.We went into the village which is a purpose built to cater to tourists, but seemed to have everything you would need for a short or longer term stay in the park. The cafe closed at 5pm, not sure it stays open longer on other days, but worth checking their hours if you were hoping to eat later.We only spent a few hours in Yosemite and would have loved to stay longer, in hindsight, dividing our stay between San Francisco and Yosemite would have been a good choice.","August 12, 2015",Impressive scenery!,17,,4

The ""tunnel view"" scene was hilarious. Two tour busses in the small parking lot with a third one trying to get in by blocking all the southbound traffic. People EVERYWHERE; cars trying to go around the busses....the scene was ludicrous.

Clearly the natural sights are breathtaking and even in the current drought and minimal waterfall flows, the overwhelming international interest is understandable. However, over those 40 years, the crowds have become crushing with more of a carnival atmosphere. Parking is impossible. Restaurants have long waits even if you finally get a seat. WiFi is overwhelmed or non-existant. Cell service is spotty despite the carriers' coverage maps and data transfer if even working is in kbps. Forget any voip or streaming. Yes. Carnival with all the overpriced attractions. $5 to take a shower after paying for a camping reservation. $30 for a pizza. $4.34 a gallon for gasoline. The campgrounds are a din of screaming kids and families, choking smoke because everyone wants their own campfire. Because reservations are near impossible, multiple families book into the same space with massive and multiple tents, dining canopies and all of their toys, bikes, stereos and drying clotheslines. No enforcement of rules, number of people, noise, generators or basic camping ettiquette. There is no open space. Even adults seem compelled to near shout in casual conversation. It just escalates and the sounds of the forest are lost. Why do some feel the need to play music as they hike or bike? No earphones. Not even a reasonable volume.

Yosemite Valley,"Everyone should see the majestic beauty of Yosemite at some point in his/her life. Here are some tips for summer trips. The park gets very crowded so go early, park & use the park provided shuttles. They visit all the stops on the valley floor. We got there by 9 and got a good spot. Bring in water. There are places on some of the trails to refill. Don't try to take kids under 6 on the moderate to strenuous trails. The trail to Vernal Falls is amazing but kids will tire out a quarter way up. Don't be fooled by the relative ease in the beginning. The trail gets very steep with no guard rails. A child or a top-heavy adult carrying a child could easily go over the side.On the route in you will see a sign that reads ""tunnel view"". After the tunnel be sure to stop to take a pic. You can see the entire valley. Have fun.","August 8, 2015",Amazing Vistas,28,"Baltimore, Maryland",5

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite is absolutely beautiful! The scenery is breathtaking! If you travel to CA, visiting Yosemite is well worth the trip. Here is some information:- Try to stay in the valley. Yosemite is large and the majority of main tourist sights are in or near the valley. Hotels/camping fills up maybe even a year in advance. However, there are cancellations - and so I would recommend that if you find it full, book a hotel outside Yosemite, and call often to see if there is a cancellation on the dates you need. If you are flexible with where you stay, you may have more luck. - There are plenty of hiking trails - some quite easy and some quite strenuous. For example, the ""hike"" (simple walk) to Yosemite Falls is very nice and easy. Paved road, mostly flat, easy for wheelchairs and strollers. Half Dome is much more difficult and will take all day. (See my review of Half Dome for more information.)- There is plenty of food in Yosemite if you prefer not to camp/cook. Yosemite Falls Lodge has two restaurants (one for burgers/pasta - simple dining) and one more expensive. Curry Village has a cafeteria with plenty of choices. There are other restaurants, sandwich shops, stores, as well. We typically just eat in the restaurants if we aren't camping.- There are several places to swim. You an swim in the river, but the water is usually cold. You can swim in Yosemite Lodge pool if you stay at that hotel or the Curry Village pool, if you stay at Curry Village. Both also have showers in the bathrooms.- The main downside of Yosemite is the crowds. In the summer, it is packed with tourists. I recommend just parking your car at your hotel and leaving it there - and get around by walking and/or taking the Yosemite (free) buses. Much simpler and more relaxing than fighting traffic and then trying to find parking again.- I also recommend that, while you visit the valley (must), you also explore other areas of Yosemite such as Mariposa Grove or Glacier Peak. (Note: The hike up from the Valley to Glacier Peak is rather strenuous, but it can be done (up and down) in approx 5-6 hours, if I recall correctly. Note that you can also take a bus up and walk down or visa versa. - Look out for bears and other wildlife. It is a nice treat to see them from a distance and take videos/pictures. Be sure to not walk up to them - you'd be amazed at what I've seen tourists do, to get a ""good picture"". It isn't worth it! If you see people stopping off the side, likely someone has spotted a bear. (We see a bear almost every time we visit Yosemite.)All in all, Yosemite is a wonderful place to visit - and as the title says - absolutely breathtaking to see those huge granite mountains!Note: I was last in Yosemite July 2014 - but I can no longer pick that date from the drop down.","August 5, 2015",Yosemite is Breathtaking!,361,"San Jose, California",5

Yosemite Valley,"Be prepared for Yosemite Valley being set up for large tour buses and foreign visitors overcrowding it. It is a bad resort set-up, not up to the standards that a National Park should be. First major point is that they accomodate cigarette smokers everywhere in the valley with smoking areas set up for them. Air quality suffers with a captive population on transit buses, or sitting at the amphitheater at Yosemite Lodge enjoying a ranger presentation. People leave their leftover food and garbage everywhere for squirrels and crows to gorge on because they provide far fewer trash receptacles in the area. Spilled food on the walkways attracts animals and bugs. It is a mess. A shopping mall is much more aesthetic and clean for walking around in. There's no excuse for the lack of care in our national park. It should be a beacon of example for other resorts and destinations, not an embarrassment to our country.

Many of Yosemite's best trails start from the valley but be sure to see the valley from above as well to get another perspective of its grandeur.

Yosemite Valley,"Getting to Yosemite by car from San Francisco was a long drive, but "" How Beautiful""!!!So many different landscapes and scenery on the way, mountains with fields of Golden looking wheat grass, against a cloudless blue sky was fabulous ~ We were late booking our first ever trip there, so we booked in ""Coulterville"", a small cabin. DO NOT ~ Once we got closer, the drive was a 2 way traffic road , very winding roads, often times too narrow to have two cars driving in opposite directions...and on my right , deep ravines...and no guard rails. Just my two cents, but never again and certainly not at night or when the sun sets !!! Other than this crazy drive, the entrance to Yosemite is majestuous...Nothing I have ever seen like it - Huge rocky mountains like El Capitain , water falls, trails, large tall Trees, space and fresh Air , nature at its best ! It is nice to leave your car in a parking lot and hop on the service buses that take you anywhere in the park. There is a good fast food type restaurant and good service. The wait can be long, so bring some snacks with you if can.On the southern part of Yosemite , we saw a "" Redwood"" forest ~ which has impressed me the most ~ Try and HUG a TREE ~ it helped me reconnect with Nature, it's beauty and essence of Life.

Yosemite Valley,"We went to Yosemite at the start of the summer, with no chances of snowfall. From the Bay area, we took the tourist bus around 7AM. We reached the Tuolumne Grove around 12 noon, to take a look at the giant sequoia trees. Moving on, the view of the Yosemite valley from the Tunnel view point was breathtaking. You could see the Half Dome peak, El Capitan rock face, and the winding Merced river flowing between two ranges of mountains. Moving on, we had the glimpse of the Bridal Veil Falls, and reached Yosemite village around half past two. We walked up to the Merced river banks (more of a cold clear stream), and the meadows. Very scenic views of the Yosemite falls and the surrounding mountains. We left around 4, stopped briefly at El Capitan Meadows, taking in the awsome straight drop of the rock face, where many adventurists try their skill in mountaineering and rock climbing. We were back at Pleasanton by 7PM. This one day trip is good enough for people in a hurry. But if you want adventure, there are special packages available with tourist companies in San Francisco.

Yosemite Valley,"My two kids wanted to visit Yosemite National Park, so we planned our trip as the following:-          Since we are coming from San Diego (SD), we decided to make our first stop in Fresno. We went out from home at 4:00pm and reached HomeWood Suites in Fresno at 10:30 pm. The Homewood Suites in Fresno offers great prices, free breakfast, free parking, and great service. They charged us about $116 per night with the AAA discount. The good thing is that we booked this room on the same day we left (SD). The reason why we didn’t stay at any hotel near Yosemite park is because the prices are too high and most of them had no available rooms.-          In the morning, we headed toward Yosemite Park. We drove about two hours to get to the Park’s main entrance, they charge about $30 per car. Then, we drove about two more hours and the road will be divided into two parts, one of them would take you to the Valley and the other one would take you to the Glacier Point. We took the Glacier point road and we drove about 1 ½  hours to get there. The Glacier point view is breath taking and you need to walk a little bit to get there after parking the car.-          We drove back to go to the Valley. At the Valley, the first thing you’ll see in the Valley is the Tunnel. The next stop in your way is going to be the Bridalveil Fall; it is very hard to find parking there. After parking your car there, you would end up walking for about 30 minutes before being able to have better view of the far away falls. After that, we drove endlessly without any luck to find a spot to park the car but the mountains’ view would leave you speechless. There is no internet service in the park, so we relied on the Smartphone’s satellite map.  -          Tips to keep in mind: have a lot of food and drinks in your car, and get your car ready to drive long distances.","July 30, 2015",Our family 👪 trip to Yosemite ,5,"San Diego, Texas",4

Go when you're young to fully enjoy all there is to see. Went to Glacier Point 1st thing. It was 9:30 by the time we got there. Not too crowded at that time but was getting crowded by time we left. Sadly, so late in the year, some of the waterfalls had gone dry. But there were still a few to see. Then we headed to Yosemite valley. Had we not wanted to get our passport book stamped at the visitor center, we would have skipped the village area. We could not find a parking spot at mid day, and there are none close to the visitor center, you have to park and walk a 1/4 mile of so to get to it. There was a nice stream running thru the park that many were swimming in. It looked very enjoyable, but we didn't have time. I would suggest taking your lunch to this park and eating at a pull out or day use area. We bought sandwiches and chips at the village store which took forever due to the crowd.

There was really not much traffic at all in the park, and we didn't have any trouble driving or parking. but - when the big buses came - it was time to leave and find another spot.

We did learn some interesting history though, and some facts about the wildlife, plants, history, etc. I recommend it if it's your first time there. We saw a mother bear with 2 cubs (we were careful to stay back) which was AMAZING; we also saw what appeared to be an adolescent-aged bear by itself a bit later. The bears seemed wholly unconcerned about us and we never felt in danger at all, though we kept a respectable distance. We also saw mule deer, squirrels (fattest squirrels we've ever seen) and lots of birds.

First I thought it was alittle to much to pay 30$/car to go and see a national park, but this is not an ordinary national park, and its very hard to explain how amazing this place is to somebody who hasnt been there. Its a must if your close by. We did the whole park in one day, we started at 07.00 in Merced and finished at 21.00 Bishop and we got to see the half dome, the mirror lake, tunnel wiev and the glacier point. This was in July and we got to see snow in the Tioga pass and just 3hours away theres Death Valley which at its highest point reached 113 Fahrenheit (45 Celsius).","July 22, 2015",Probably one of the coolest places on earth!,15,,5

In the summer season you need to arrive early as parking around the Village fills up by 9-10 AM. If you were able to park, you can get on the site seeing bus and have fun.

Yosemite Valley,"The valley floor is a mishmash of vehicles and people, most not prepared to make a moderate hike, let alone venture out of their mode of transport. That said, we got there early (5:30 am) and headed up the Four Mile trail - we were the only ones on the trail!!! It was excellent- gorgeous views and except for the gnats, very pleasant to criss-cross the mountain side. Glacier Point was pretty much deserted when we arrived at the top. We waited for the gift shop to open, grabbed some snacks and headed down panorama- which didn't disappoint! Great hike! However, when we reached the Mist Trail civilization intervened and congestion abounded. The free transit busses were overcrowded and slow. We had reservations at Yosemite Lodge and knew there was no air conditioning there, but 98 degrees with no fans was stifling. Since we couldn't camp without a permit, we checked out at 10 pm and decided to head back to Merced. The Hampton Inn was a most welcome air conditioned haven.","July 20, 2015",Go to the Heights!!!,20,"Roseburg, oregon",3

Yosemite Valley,"We arrived in the Valley late afternoon, Sunday 5th July, as the 4th July crowds were leaving. We made sure to stop at Tunnel View on our way in, which involved a slight diversion but must be done. We stayed 3 nights at Yosemite Lodge at the Falls (separate review), which put us in a fabulous location to enjoy the Valley. We spent the whole of the Monday in the Valley itself. We hired bikes from Yosemite Lodge at the Falls (which must have had good saddles as they didn't make me sore) and rode many of the level, paved paths. It was a hot day and I think that got to see a lot more than we would have if walking, and to enjoy the scenery more than if on shuttles or tours. The best thing we did was cycle to Curry Village, leave our bikes there, and hire a raft to go on a tour hour adventure along the Merced River. At the end there is a shuttle bus to bring you back to Curry Village. This was sheer bliss, not too busy, easy - though slow and it involve our son having to push us off rocks a few times. Watching the fabulous scenery go by from the river itself was amazing. Four of us fitted in raft fine. We were on the river over midday and needed our brimmed hats. Afterwards we continued on our bikes to popular places, we didn't do a lot of trail walking as it was too hot for us and we felt we were enjoying wonderful scenery just being there, also the waterfalls were very low at the beginning of July during extreme drought. Bridal Veil Falls was very disappointing, however Yosemite Falls was still pretty great and viewed from Glacier Point, so were Nevada and Vernal Falls. We ate at Yosemite Lodge at the Falls Food Court (separate review) which we were very happy with, and the second evening went to see a presentation about Yosemite Search and Rescue at Yosemite Theatre (by shuttle bus), which was very interesting and sobering. Day two we visited Glacier Point and Sentinel Dome (separate reviews) and in the evening enjoyed ""Starry Skies over Yosemite"", meeting a short walk from Yosemite Lodge at the Falls and walking to a meadow where we lay on tarp sheets as we were shown particular stars and features with a family friendly talk. It was a clear night and the stars were spectacular, also this is cheap and neither strenuous nor too lengthy, just right for after dinner. I did book before I left England but think that tickets would have been available on the day. The next day we had to leave but spent it driving along the Tioga Pass on our way to June Lake, stopping at various points, unfortunately accompanied by rain. It actually snowed along there that night, which seemed to take everyone by surprise in July. I would say that it is really worthwhile staying in the Valley itself, though it was necessary for us to book almost a year ahead. We spent a lot of money on the visit, and hiring the bikes and the rafting weren't cheap, nor were the meals, but we loved it all. At the beginning of July we didn't feel that anywhere was too crowded and the drought didn't spoil it, except for Bridal Veil Falls being missing from the Tunnel View! I previously visited Yosemite with my parents 36 years ago and have always wanted to take my own family there, so this was a dream come true.","July 18, 2015",Wonderful,77,"Surrey, England",5

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite deserved way more time than 24hrs, but we were doing an intense 2wk road trip, and only had 1 night in Yosemite.We stayed in Cedar Lodge which was really handy being at the bottom of the valley, so easy to start the day early, with a 1hr drive up to Glacier Point, or 30mins drive to the start of the circular route / Bridalveil Falls.Along the Tioga Pass Road, we did 4 stops:1) stopped for a 1-mile walk in Tuolumne Meadows, parking near the Visitors Centre, and walking up to Soda Springs and back. Beautiful views and highly recommended, which we did in 1 hr at a gentle pace with lots of photo stops !2) We also stopped at the beginning and end of Tenaya Lake for views.3) Then a lovely stop at Olmstead Point where you can do a 300m walk to a fantastic viewpoint - well worth the stop.4) Final stop was at Tuolumne Grove for the 2-mile round trip walk to see the giant sequoia trees. Quite a long steep-ish descent, then a loop around the sequoias, with a fantastic gigantic dead tree which they have build a tunnel through ! We took 1.5hrs on this walk at a gentle pace with lots of photo stops !At the bottom of the valley we did 4 stops:1) Did the 2hr round trip drive up to Glacier Point which was well worth it. You could easily spend an hour up here looking at the various view points and admiring the incredible view. 2) Bridalveil Falls - very short walk to the base of the falls, 20min round trip walk, but you can spend longer if you want to scramble up the rocks to see the pool at the bottom of the falls.3) Stopped at the side of the road for the short walk to Lower Yosemite Falls which was a lovely walk through trees, crossing over wooden bridges, and great view of the falls. The walk to Upper Yosemite Falls was about 2-4hrs which we didn't have time to do4) Stopped at a layby just before El Capitan and had a wonderful walk through the meadows for great views of El Capitan and we could spot climbers with our binoculars.We felt we managed all the main sights in 24hrs, but if we had longer, we would have enjoyed many more of the trails.","July 17, 2015",Top sights in 24hrs !,327,"Guildford, United Kingdom",5

Yosemite Valley,"That's right, grand yosemite. The expanse of this magnificent landscape deserves this title. The valley is quite busy most of spring and summer, has everything needed for camping and hiking. Like any other major national park, the amenities are pretty much standard. Cars go in as far as possible, good parking and camping spots. Keep your food covered and out of sight in the cars or in the park provided bear proof containers in different locations including parking lots. I wish time and health permitted me to go on all trails. The water falls are beautiful, vista from mirror lake, tunnel view, glacier point are amazing. These are the must visit spots along with mariposa grove for the humongous sequoia trees. There you can walk and drive through giant trees!! wait, you haven't seen the real thing yet. You have to drive up to kings canyon and sequoia national park to see the worlds largest tree -General Shermann. We did not stay over night in the valley, did. Numerous day trips from Fresno. 'As The Crow Flies' distance to the valley and other attractions from Fresno is not much but the mountainous winding roads make it time consuming.

You can rent rafts for $31 per person (4 people max/raft) from Curry Village. We got some really amazing views of the major sights to see from the river. The river isn't too busy because of lack of snow/rainfall, so it's pretty calm. The rafts are available for your use for the entire day, so you can stop along the way as much as you want. Make sure you bring your own snacks and drinks, but don't bring giant coolers, it won't fit in the raft. A personal-sized cooler should work. We made the 3 mile journey in about 2 1/2 hours.

We visited Glacier Point - along with 400 others, but hiked down to the valley and passed 3 travelers along the entire 4+ miles.One beautiful thing about Yosemite is that it presents a perfect chance to ""check-out"" from all-encompassing modern life. The available quiet and tranquility melt away stress, and the general lack of cell reception, email, etc., allow you to tune in by tuning out, so to speak.Highly recommend a trip of a few days.

Most cannot even be enjoyed because of the thick forest. Many more awe inspiring vistas along Big Sur, Sonoma, or even San Francisco itself. Yosemite is no jewel. It is no escape to nature.

They have good shuttle service to take you anyway in the park. It's really big-so take the shuttle! I recommend you plan ahead and stay inside the park if possible. We stayed a few miles outside. The road up the mountain each day was scary-some people would find it exciting. It was nerve racking! You ride along the edge of the mountain with few or no guardrails.

I knew the distance was long before the trip, but I had hoped that either (A) the journey would be interesting or (B) I would be able to sleep on the journey, but no such luck. In particular the bus driver talked through most of the trip with what was at best a mediocre commentary.If you want to see Yosemite, stay overnight or start from a point closer than San Francisco. The time you stay there is just too short to get anything other than a postcard view of the place, which in truth is not so much different from seeing pretty pics on the Internet.","July 8, 2015",Don't do a day tour from San Francisco,36,"Melbourne, Australia",3

Speed limits are sometimes hard to find- so we just assumed 25 MPH most places.

The fires have not touched the inside of the valley so it is a relief after mile after mile of burnt forests as you travel to the main entrance. Nature at its very best. Even better in spring or fall. If you are a senior then a seniors pass to all National Parks for ten bucks from the National Park service is a great deal.

Also, the panoramic hike or four mile hike downhill would have been great.Take more time in the valley if you can!you do encounter masses, but only at the main sights. hike some, and they will dissolve. the shuttle is good, but a little unreliable during rush hours (which seems to be half the day).","July 1, 2015",gem of the NP,82,Wien,5

Shook up we carried on but the amount of impatient tourists overtaking us and beeping was shocking. Why go somewhere with amazing scenery and decide you want to race through the place. There should be more signs telling people why they need to slow down. The scenery is better than anywhere I have ever been to in the usa but what spoiled it somewhat, on 4 different occasions I heard american tourists complaining about the amount of foreign accents they could hear.

We couldn't stay because we were on time restraints but I WILL BE RETURNING to spend more tim exploring.

Gasoline within the park is a priced at $4.99 per gallon. We stay outside of the park in a B&B. Therefore we could have dinner in Town. There is a road that's ONE WAY and once you're on it, you must continue. This park is great for long hikes but I'm unable to due that due to knee replacement recovery. But the visit was great anyway. I don't understand how people can climb and sleep on the side of those mountains. I suggest staying outside of the Park as Hotel & Hotel Food Prices are very high. Our B&B was about $225 per night vs $600+ in the Park Hotels. Plus the in Town restaurants were very good.

You have to reserve camping spots or hotels way in advance but can keep checking the website (nps.gov/yose) to see if something opens up. Driving a motorhome on the narrow winding roads is a challenge, wouldn't go in one over 21 ft.(what we had). May & June are the best months for the weather and for lots of water going over all the falls. July & August are best if you want to swim in the river but don't swim where they tell you not too or you'll go over a waterfall and meet your maker !!

For example, I had a hard time understanding that to go to Miriposa Grove and Tioga Pass I needed to follow the signs to the Park Exits. The Valley shuttles are great, running frequently. I recommend you research the hiking trails on your own ahead of time. The NPS guide has very little information on them and only on a few. You need a couple days just in the valley to see everything. El Capitan shuttles run less frequently but do a good loop as well. Overall, there should be more shuttles running to more far-out places.

Yosemite Valley,"Visited Yosemite for the first time in 30 years. The scenery was incredible, as I remembered it from before. But the restaurants, shops, and manned attractions were almost all terrible.To give some examples:- Renting a single raft from Curry Village cost $120 for a family of 4, but the lifejackets were filthy and stink, the attendant indifferent (and rather in need of personal hygiene himself!), and the service awful (you have to drag your own 100 pound raft 100 yards to the river launch point and again at the landing!). A ripoff at this price.- The Yosemite Valley Lodge lobby and food court both had ""bathrooms closed for remodeling"" signs posted for says on end.- The brochures for many attractions were wrong about opening hours and pricing- Many restaurants were only open during very limited hours, for example, only from 11-1 for lunch. On top of that, in the Yosemite Valley Lodge food court, only 1 (of 3 or 4) food stations inside was actually open, resulting in huge lines.- The park signage was insufficient and confusing.- The bathrooms were uniformly filthy and stinky, even early in the morning when they should have been the cleanestAll of the concessions/services are run by Delaware Companies North, which seems to have a lock on many national parks in the U.S. In ost other parks (e.g., Yellowstone), they seem to do a decent (if unspectacular) job, but Yosemite was a dump. The only two bright spots were Yosemite Valley Lodge bike rentals (terrific service there!) and the shuttle buses (which were clean and timely).

We cut off of 120 to go to Mariposa grove Grove ( one of the sequoia tree groves with the easiest access to the trees) We spent about 5 hrs. mostly driving. There is a lot to see and I can understand how someone could get lost in this amazing wilderness. I wished we had planned better before we went I'm sure I missed lots of things that I would have liked to see. We did have a small delay about 1/2 hour. They are repaving the road.

All the tour guides give lots of information about the native American history of the park and the origins of the names of landmarks in the park and make several stops for photos.

This is a magical, unique place which brings one back to the connection we share with the natural world and reminds us of our insignificance with its sheer power and majesty.

Yosemite Valley,This is where you can see and do a lot in one area. Be sure to go to the movies they have about the park. It makes you appreciate what you are seeing more when you have background information. There are good displays in the visitor center about the formation of the area. The trails there are good for viewing the falls and the Merced River that runs through the valley. One thing is to be careful and not think you can tackle rock climbing around the falls. We saw some young people have to be rescued by helicopter at Bridal Veil Falls when things didn't go as planned. I am sure they thought it wouldn't happen to them but the rangers said they have to rescue people every other day in the summer. Be sure to use the free shuttle system to get around. it's easy and efficient. ,"June 7, 2015",So much to see in the valley,124,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5

Yosemite Valley,"My goodness. Upon driving into the Valley we had to pull over the car and marvel at the beauty. I had seen photos and paintings, but they do not do the place justice. My wife said is was what she thinks heaven will be like. I know many poets have said it better, but this is a place that must be experienced in person so that all of one's senses can know it. At every turn something beautiful, wonderful and relaxing to the bone and soul. There are few places I go to and know that I will have to come back (simply because there are so many OTHER places I have not been and want to get to), but this is one place my wife and i want to come back to when we can stay longer just to ""chill out.Tip: We went in May when school was still in and summer tourist were not there so it was nice and easy to get around. I think I might have had a different experience if the roads had been full and there were people everywhere.Tip #2: get hotel reservations as early as you can.

Yosemite Valley,When in San Francisco I honestly believe that you haven't truly appreciated this city without visiting Yosemite.Yosemite is a place of great majesty which truly has the ability to make you understand your minuteness in the grand scheme of things. It is truly a place of wonder. My husband and I deeply regret that we did not have more time here to go deeper and truly wander further through the park. Glacier Point Road is an absolute must if you do find yourself at Yosemite. The views are awe inspiring - even more so if you are lucky to find adventurous souls climbing Half Dome.Yosemite captures you from the moment you arrive and doesn't let you leave easily. Get accommodation as close to Yosemite as you can so you can go back for a second day. Camp there if you can. Or do what we did and drive there yourself so you can leave when you wish. But book far ahead. We did the Valley Floor Tour which we found enjoyable and informative but we also enjoy driving around and stopping where we wished.

Plan on hiking or walking to Yosemite Falls, visiting the Ansel Adams gallery and watching one of the movies. You can also rent bikes, there's plenty of restaurants and food places of all kinds.For anyone visiting the first time, I would recommend staying in the area at least 3-5 days. We were there for 5.

Yosemite Valley,"This stunning National Park should be on everyone’s bucket list, perhaps more than once. The beauty of Yosemite is well documented, so no need to dwell on that. However, with 4-millon visitors anticipated for 2015, here are several suggestions: Parking can be a nightmare. We arrived the Saturday after Memorial Day and Yosemite was packed. We arrived mid-day, and drove around for more than an hour trying to find a place to park. To avoid this, arrive no later than mid-morning if possible, and visit during weekdays if your schedule permits. Yosemite has a wonderful shuttle bus system throughout the valley. Once you’re parked, use the shuttle.  Take a tour. We took a 2-hour valley tour…best idea we had. The tour was reasonably priced, and our guide, Katie, was fun to listen to and very informative. Ours was the shortest tour offered…others, longer, are available. Visit Glacier Point…awesome views. Again, go early, as parking can be a chore past mid-morning. Tours are available. The Mariposa sequoia grove is also awesome, but…oh, that parking problem. Free shuttles are available from Wawona. Note that the Mariposa grove will be closed beginning in July 2015 for maintenance. We stayed 2-nights at the Yosemite View Lodge. Pricey, and the rooms are fairly basic. No AC, but wifi and TV are included. Enjoy this incredible national treasure. With a little planning, your visit—like ours—will be amazing!","June 3, 2015",Yosemite...an American Gem!,5,Central Florida,5
Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley in Yosemite National Park is filled with amazing sights no matter where you look. You will see Bridleveil Falls, and both Upper and Lower Yosemite Falls. All have great paved trails to areas for easy viewing near the base of the falls. The meadows in the valley frequently provide close viewing of deer and on rare occasion a view of the more elusive wildlife; black bears, coyotes and raccoon. The valley also is the viewing area for watching the climbers scale the face of El Capitan. The major camping and other accommodations are also in the valley along with a visitor center, shopping, gallery and Nature Center. Through it all runs the Merced River, sometimes placid and in other places very rapid.","June 3, 2015",Breathtaking beauty,13,"San Diego, California",5

Yosemite Valley,"I have been to the valley floor multiple times and truly my best times have been mid spring. The views of the different falls are better at this time because the snow is beginning to melt at the higher elevations. There can still be snow on the ground and there can still be a random snow fall in the area. The park service has a great shuttle system in the valley, so you can park and then hike some short distances, if your able. Park starts to get crowded beginning in late spring.

Yosemite Valley,"These are my views, I haven't been here in 22 years. Other know more I assure you.We came into the park from the west from Manteca CA a 3 hour drive in a RV to Yosemite Valley. The exit off the 99 is the Yosemite ave. / 120 . Just east of the 99 at this exit is a Home Depot with free WiFi, In and Out, Applebee’s with free WiFi password protected just about next to each other. There is a Shell gas station just across Yosemite ave with easy entry and exit for the RV and traffic signal to get back on the road. If that place is busy as you head eastbound to your destination you can get fuel in Oakdale, you will be traveling on the 120 then making a left turn on to the 108 there are a few gas station the best one for an RV is a shell station on your left that seems to have the most room to get back on the way.  There is a section that is very winding road 11 miles or so be prepared, you will climb to 6000 feet. You will see damage that a fire has done. Be sure to bring a old fashioned paper map because phones will not be able to bring up maps when you get into the trees. I made 3 wrong turns.Lower Pines Campground is on the East end of the ValleyCell phones; do not work other that texting and that’s not a sure thing. In our group we has 3 of the major carriers Sprint, Verizon and T Mobile they all sucked.

Has free wifi for guests in a lounge next to the Food password protected. Guests get the password. The area has chairs and such to sit down so if you go there make sure you have a full charge is case you stumble on the password. HeheFood; Expensive all over the valley.

It never gets old and worth the money. Tours start at 10 am the earlier the better the sun at 4000 feet elevation can get warm quick. There were 5 of us that wanted to go on the Tour they gave us at deal at 18.00 a person. Brink your camera, water, snacks and a hat. You will have 2 stops along the way to snack and a bathroom at the 1st stop for us old guys. You will learn things you never knew about the valley.

Some restrictions 12 years old and maybe a height requirement I can’t remember.Washington’s Column You can see this magnificent rock from camp just across Merced river we were able to keep track of climbers each night because they wear headlamps when they made camp or climb. On a full moon we saw the 2 climbers reached the summit on our last night there. We followed their progress each night while we sat around the campfire.

Yosemite Valley,"After eating a picnic lunch at the lower Yosemite Falls viewpoint and then walking out to the Lower Falls overlook (access the trail between Yosemite Village and Yosemite Lodge).... My husband, 9 year old son, and I rented bikes and cruised around Yosemite Valley. We rented bikes from Yosemite Lodge and we should have parked there too. There are numerous places around the Valley to park, but the Lodge would have been more convenient because after we dropped off our bikes we were pretty tired and ready to head out. That said we were able to cover a lot of ground by peddling around and exploring. We even stopped off at the Ahwahnee Hotel and had drinks out on the lawn and explored the interior! Awesome day!","June 2, 2015",Epic!! Cover more ground. Do the valley on bikes.,17,"Scottsdale, Arizona",5
Yosemite Valley,"Our trip to Yosemite Valley was fantastic. The views were some of the prettiest I have ever seen anywhere. The 2 hour Valley Floor Tour that we took with the Park Service was great. The Park Ranger was engaging and knowledgeable. The buildings, facilities and grounds were very clean. The children that we saw, and there were a lot of them, were well behaved. I think the dramatic views and transcendence to the place even affects them.The only bad thing I have to say, and the reason I didn't rate Yosemite Valley a rating of 5, was because of the traffic. Granted, it was Memorial Day weekend and evidently their busiest weekend of the year, but they Park Service has been doing this for a long time and should have this situation down pat.We got in to the Park on Saturday afternoon and headed to the Visitor's Center Parking lot so we could visit the Museum, see the film, visit the Ansel Adams exhibit and go to the Indian Village.The road near the Visitor's Center and Lodges is all one way so you have to make a large loop to get in and out of the park.We got about 2 miles from the Visitor's area and traffic was dead stopped. It took us 2 1/2 hours to go those last 2 miles. There were Park Rangers directing traffic near the parking area and at the nearby intersections. We were so late getting in, that we continued on the loop road and left.The next morning, Sunday, we had reserved the Valley Floor Tour. We left our B&B 2 1/2 hours before our tour to make sure we got there on time. We arrived in the park about 9:30 and were at the Parking area about 10:00. There were still parking places in the lot and the traffic was very light. We had a wonderful day in the park and went back to our car about 4:00 to leave, where we sat for 1 1/2 hours!! trying to get to the road to leave the park.The Park Ranger told us they were trying a new system for cars coming and going and obviously it wasn't working. Once we got onto the loop road, leaving the park wasn't too bad and traffic was moving.So.....Yosemite is beautiful and a not to be missed spot, but maybe plan to be there at an off time.May is a beautiful time to go and the waterfalls are gorgeous this time of year as the snow above is melting but I wouldn't go again during a holiday weekend.","June 2, 2015",Amazing..

I would recommend wearing hiking boots and wearing layered clothes. It started to get very chilly around 2 o'clock. On our way back from the lake, we ran into a brown bear on the same trail we were walking. So be careful and alert out there. If you do run into a bear remember to be noisy, bang pots and pans if you have them, act big and yell and scream and growl, if there's two of you stand side-by-side so you look bigger. Do not feed the bears, as they will become more tame and aggressive.

There was a stop to see the Giant Sequoiras which was interesting, a very tranquil walk. We are used to walking and so were fine with the walk back up hill. Albeit surprised that we were advised not to go right round the loop, can only assume there were time constraints. I think we only saw 3 or 4 sequoiras, but lots of very large Douglas pine type trees etc too. We were only given about 90 minutes in the main valley. Were advised we could either walk the three mile loop or go to the falls. We managed to do both (the loop did not seem as long as stated) and elected to take sandwiches and eat them on the way round.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is one of those must-visit places everyone should see at least once in a lifetime. Of course, the downside to that is that it's very crowded - we visited in shoulder-season and there were so many people on the paths to Bridal Veil Falls and Yosemite Falls, it was distracting. I wouldn't want to go in summer. But we were able to get away from the crowds on those less-traveled trails, like Wawona Meadows and Sentinel Beach, and that's when you can really experience the Valley.

I also took the 2 hour Valley Tour on an open bus type vehicle and loved it. Ranger Karen was very knowledgeable but also very funny! You can really see many of the great views just on this little, inexpensive tour. Saw deer, coyotes but no bears. But that was okay too. Also loved the free tram that runs throughout the Valley.

Yosemite Valley,"I am writing this as someone who has been to Yosemite over a dozen times. The first time you go through the tunnel and see the valley is incredible! It takes your breath away. It is absolutely worth the hype, but there are some things to know before you go. If you want to stay in the park you need to book the hotel or campground WAY in advance. I mean around six months to a year in advance especially if you are visiting between May and September. Be prepared for heavy traffic and tons of tourists during summer months as well. If you are expecting to be isolated, the valley is not the place to visit for that. There are lots of waterfalls to visit in the valley and each one has a different degree of difficulty. Lower yosemite falls is a quick and easy walk. Upper yosemite falls is a great hike, but due to the drought, upper yosemite waterfall will dry up by late June or early July. Also, keep in mind the hike has a lot of switchbacks. Vernal falls and Nevada falls both have a decent incline, but flows pretty steady all year long. This is my favorite national park and I continue to find new things to do and see.","May 17, 2015",Pictures don't do it justice!!!,29,michigan,5
Yosemite Valley,"Everyone should come here at least once. Amazing vistas. The crush of tourists can be off putting at the major attractions (especially the short walk to Yosemite Falls), but it is an easy stroll to walk the river or on paths through meadows where you'll have stunning vistas and fewer or no companions. The shuttle bus is a godsend as far as getting around the valley (park your car and leave it there) but they can get very packed at peak hours. Book accommodations a year before you want to stay in the valley, or you'll have a VERY difficult time obtaining anything (unless you randomly luck out and nab someone's cancellation). If traveling there when winter weather is possible (which happened to me in mid May!), highway 140 stays below the snow line, and is a very easy road. From any road, be prepared for lines of cars at the park entrances, waiting processing to enter. If staying outside the park, but wanting to come in and out each day, an annual park unlimited access card is currently $80 (only $10 if 62+). Otherwise entrance costs $30 each time. This fee is on top of and independent of any lodging or campsite fees, so just be aware of that.","May 17, 2015",Everyone should see it once!,12,,5

You don't have to spend days hiking in the park to see the stunning sights, but if you're able to I think it's well worth it. This was our first visit to the Yosemite Valley, so we didn't do any hiking and drove to most of the main viewpoints etc, which were all accessible and easy to find with the visitor map.

Yosemite Valley,"Being out here was hands down the best experience I have had doing anything, and I'm proud to say I'm not exaggerating. I have always loved the outdoors, and this has been on my list for a very long time; I was not disappointed. It's such a shame that we only had one day to spend here, but the next time we come back I am definitely going to make sure we spend at least 4-5 days seeing and doing everything this park has to offer.Even though we only had a day, we managed to hit quite a few of the landmarks. Glacier Point, Washburn Point, and Tunnel View have some absolutely breathtaking scenery. Sentinel Dome looked like an amazing hike, however when we got there the Ranger told us not to risk it because of overhead thunder clouds. To make the best of your visit, I highly suggest you hike as much as possible, as many of the hidden beauties of the Yosemite are not reachable by automobile. I also suggest you bring your own lunch; it is expensive here, but then again, food is expensive at every park, and on top of that this is a secluded location. Expensive food is to be expected, so it's better just to bring your own.If you're anywhere near the Yosemite, the drive down is definitely worth it. Even if you have health issues preventing you from hiking (i.e. my dad has a bad back), there are great viewing areas just steps from parking areas. There truly is something for everybody, and everybody should experience this at least once.","May 14, 2015",Time of my life,56,"Toronto, Canada",5

Be sure to visit the Ansel Adams gallery and if you can see Lee Stetson rendition of John Muir at the theater. Both are amazing! If you can plan to do so, visit the Valley in the Springtime. April and May are best. Crowds are at a minimum and the Falls are beautiful! Have Fun!

Yosemite Valley,"We stayed at a rental house in Oakhurst and drove in each day, which was a long drive unfortunately. Since we arrived to the house late afternoon on Friday, we made the 1.5 hour drive to Yosemite Valley before sunset and started with Tunnel View. We got some great shots there, it wasn't very crowded since it was April and a weekday. We then went to Bridalveil falls and did the short hike to the base of the waterfall. The sun was starting to set by then, so we drove around the loop looking for Valley View. After a few stops at smaller turnouts, we finally found it but it was dark by then. Saturday it was raining and snowing so we slept in since sunrise shooting would not be worth leaving the house at 4:30am. We headed into the park again before noon, no chains required by then since it was raining instead of snowing, but it was so crowded everywhere. Even with the bad weather, it was packed, but this was our only full day so we continued on. The rain was off and on, with a few small moments of sunshine peaking through the clouds. Very good for photography, when the weather cooperated. We stopped at Cathedral Beach, Swinging Bridge, Cook's Meadow, Valley View, and attempted to have lunch at the Ahwahnee hotel but it was too crowded and the valet was so rude we left.The weather cleared up Saturday night so we left Oakhurst at 4:30am to catch the sunrise in the valley. Three days of doing the long drive was getting really tiring, but it was our last day and the weather was going to be great so we had to do it. As we were getting close to the valley, the sun started to come up slowly. We wanted to try the turnout before the tunnel, but it wasn't that good since the sun was coming up behind Half Dome. So we turned around and drove a couple miles back where we saw some clouds trapped in a little valley, found a turnout and walked a little to get a better view. That was an amazing sight, we waited as the sun rose and lit up the clouds, and there was only one other photographer there so it was a nice break from the crowds the previous day. We drove around the loop and didn't see anything else that good to shoot at the time, tried Valley View one last time and got some ok shots, but not as good as at sunset.If we had a smaller group, and wanted to spend more on lodging, it would be much better to stay in the park. It's an hour from the South Entrance, and that's driving fast, so with traffic I would say it could be up to two hours during the busy times.","April 28, 2015","Amazing Views, You Could Spend Days Here",246,"San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico",5

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is an amazing place with spectacular landmarks and vistas all over the valley. There are many options for easy to difficult hikes/walks depending upon what you're looking for each with amazing scenery. Stop in the visitor center for maps and suggestions. Here's a great site that lists all of the hikes along with distance, difficulty, scenic factor, and crowd factor: http://www.yosemitehikes.com/hikes.htmOne thing we found is that getting around the park in a car can be confusing as there are minimal signs but lots of possible turns and winding roads. It took us a few days to figure out our way around even with a map. For example there are no signs that direct you to the Visitor Center. It turns out that there's no cars allowed in the Village Center. You have to know that it's behind the Village Store and park there and go through the store or take the unmarked path that goes behind it. That being said, if you take the free Valley shuttle service it can take you everywhere in the Valley. It however does not go to Glacier Point (a must see for the most spectacular views - 45 minutes away) or to Mariposa Grove (giant sequoia trees - 1 hour away). Be aware that there's no gas available in the valley so be sure to have enough to get you around and back out of the park. The nearest gas station is in El Portal which is about 15 minutes away, just outside the park.","April 25, 2015",Incredible views everywhere you look,70,New Jersey,5

We arrived to Yosemite 1 night before until 11 pm and we stayed in camp 4 (you need a tend and is 6dolars/each). Please if you want stay in Yosemite call before because all year is full. First day: We wake up so early and we went to Yosemite falls (down) there are two next to camp 4, one is down 10 min walking and so easy and the another is 4 or 6 hours, we did only the first. Beautiful for a few photos.Then we went to another falls: Vernal Fall and Nevada fall. The first is easy-medium because you need go up for a lot stairs. It is great and you can rest in the river. Then is 1 or 2 hour more up.Around 4pm we return to car, but there are shuttle and the car it is not necessary. And we went to Mirror lake, easy hiking but it was a little dry (1 hour and 1/2)Around 6 pm we went to Valley view next to Tunnel, and we wait for the sunset. You can bring something for eat or drink. I think this moment was the best of the day.And the we slept in upper pines (25 dolars the site).Second middle day: We didn't have a lot time for that we went to curry village, ate something, bough merchandise, and we did picnic in the Capitan the biggest rock for climbing (a little hiking for go to this place).Dutes: the are shuttles, the showers in curry village are pretty good, you need put all your food in security box for the bears, bring your food because it is a little expensive, and obviously enjoy!.Sorry if you can understand my english ","April 20, 2015",Yosemite in 1 and 1/2 day ,54,"Vina del Mar, Chile",5

The Landscape is amazing, the infrastructure is perfect and the park staff is proud to help you anytime. One may complain that wi-fi was a scarce resource at Curry Village but, to be true, I think that being unconnected for a few days just added to the entire experience.I would recommend something that I think is better if you have few days and wants to explore this huge park: go by car. The roads are well signalized (but get yourself a map) and I think is is much better than depend on the bus service inside the park (just because you dont have to be concerned with the time-table etc). I bought a book with the best trails in Yosemite ( see some of them here: http://www.yosemitehikes.com/yosemite-info/ten-best-easy-hikes.htm).

The park was not as crowded as in during the summer.It is very convenience to visit all the landmarks in the valley, you can walk, drive (although some areas has restriction on car access) or by taking the park shuttle bus. In my opinion, the shuttle bus service is the best way to travel within the valley. There are 21 stops along the route and the bus comes every 5 to 10 minutes. If you have a bus map on hand, you can plan for shortcut to save some time. The best thing is the shuttle service is FREE!There is a visitor center in the park and a village store and a few cafes that you can grab some quick snack or a meal. The visitor center is the best place to learn geology and history of Yosemite valley. If you like art, the Ansel Adams Art Gallery is the place to go.If you like to take pictures, stop along the Southside Drive near the Swinging Bridge area to take the full view of the Upper and Lower Yosemite falls, the Merced River, the meadows and the spectacular view of the Half Dome. However, due to the forth consecutive year of ongoing drought, the meadows are dry and brown color. On the Northside Drive, you can view the panoramic view of the El Capitan and the Half Dome.

Yosemite Valley,"Mother Nature has nothing to do with this place any more. I only give a rating of two because of the stunning mountains surrounding the valley. The views are NOT WORTH the crowds!!!!! Kids running amok with indifferent parents who just want to get way from their own brats, garbage, partiers shouting and partying all night, drunks, etc. Seriously, this place has nothing to do with wilderness or getting away from it all any more. You might as well be in downtown San Francisco for all the wilderness you'll find here. I admire the national park service but they're just too overwhelmed by all the people, under funded and understaffed. I honestly believe Yosemite has reached a point of no return unless they close the place to everyone. Those memories and images of the happy 1940's and 50's families with their trailer camper escaping the city life for a family vacation in seclusion by a lake .... It's long since dead and gone. It sickens me to think of the destruction of this beautiful place and animal life. I know out of the way places in the Sierra Nevada that are wilderness, are not famous, have few people and are true escapes. I'll stick to those and leave Yosemite to you guys who think you've gotten away from you city life. ","March 18, 2015",Too Many People!!!,322,"Reardan, Washington",2

Yosemite Valley,"I was recommended the above track by the visitor centre in Mariposa. I am a trail runner so and hiker but on this occasion decided a run was the best option. This track was outstanding! The views were truly exceptional and every turn presented new perspectives that one can only stand in awe of. I have to say the experience was one I will never forget!In detail the track up to Glacier Point from the valley was a steep goat track that strangely enough has been laid with concrete! Def the first mountain track I have ever done with a laid footpath, this takes away from the authenticity of the 'outdoors' element slightly but allows for the environment to be maintained, so i see it as a good thing. The view from Glacier Point is outstanding and covers just about the while valley but you cant see El'Capitan.From Glacier Point it is a short uphill to Sentinel Dome, I think its about a 250m elevation increase...and completely worth it! This was the best view I got on the entire track. It is truly a 360 deg panoramic view of the entire Yosemite National Park. You can see all major attractions in the Valley, including El'Capitan, plus miles out into the distance in every direction! Truly a beautiful location, I would say Sentinel Dome provides the best overall view that is within a short distance from the Yosemite Valley. For a small effort from Glacier Point it is worth the effort.From Sentinel Dome it is onto the Panarama Trail that takes you all the way to Vernal Falls. The route is very beautiful and as for running I think it is a perfect blend of down and uphill variations to allow for an enjoyable experience. As I said above there are so many different perspectives you gain of sights in the area as you travel on the trail that make it well worth the effort. I would say the track is about 60% down hill and 40% uphill, so if you are totally shattered at Sentinel Dome it may be worth leaving it for another day.Vernal Falls are truly amazing and this is a great spot to chill out on the rocks to have lunch and enjoy the sun, as I saw many people doing. As I was running I stopped to appreciate the beauty and looked around but did not stop to work on the tan;-) The Mist trail leads down into the valley and was easy going but a little bit shocking on the knees when running. The steps are just a bit smaller than my feet would like and the height just a bit bigger than is comfortable haha. I normally like rock hoping down hill but I found my knees getting a good going over on this occasion, nothing to bad but wouldn't recommend if you have knee issues. The views of the Merced river and the various falls are very beautiful as you make your way down to the valley floor. Again I was surprised that half way down the track turns into a paved foot path, but this can only be to preserve the environment due to the large numbers of people visiting the area.Once arriving in the Valley again it was a light jog back to the car which was parked at the big car park in the village. I found that parking here was a good starting point for the run as it gave me about a 2mile warm up run to get to the trail head up to Glacier Point and a 3 mile warm down run from the bottom of the mist trail.I highly recommend this as a half day run or a full day hike. All in all I think it was 30km or 18miles round trip...with the warm up and warm down run to/from car park. I took about 5 hours, but I was pretty cruisy, deciding to stop frequently and take in my surroundings. I had three long stops for a munch and time to chill and appreciate the amazing sights.. Glacier Point, Sentinel Dome and Vernal Falls. I think it could easily be done in more like 3 hours or close to however i would recommend taking the cruisy approach to give time to stop and enjoy the surroundings.When I went to the Yosemite village the next day and asked what they recommend to do after this...they said something along the lines of.. 'well you have probably seen it all by doing that track, if you want to do an activity then there are options but as far as sights, you wont get it better than what you saw"" I hope this helps anyone else planning a trip. To maximise your coverage and see as much as possible....this is a great option. Also a great trail for running with variation in track style and a good mix of up and down hill.","March 17, 2015",Glacier Point/ Sentinel Dome/ Panarama Track,12,"Auckland, New Zealand",5

The free shuttle around the park helps those with limited time see more but during peak times they can be crowded. Unfortunately we were there on a long weekend and as a consequence there were thousands and thousands and thousands of people in the park and that meant thousands and thousands and thousands of cars parked everywhere. On the plus side at least here were a few Americans exploring some part of their country unlike the intrepid Aussies who also venture far and wide.

Yosemite Valley,"1. We are on the Delaware North Corporation preferred members e-mail list, and every May receive an e-mail announcing special winter rates during their 72 hour sale of lodging in Yosemite National Park.2. These are often Sunday-Thursday bookings only, which is fine with me, as that means few school age kids -the rooms at both the Lodge and the Ahwahnee have little noise insulation.3. Reservations at yosemitepark.com, up to a year in advance, with cancellations within 7 days in advance without penalty.4. In winter the primary choices within the Yosemite valley are Yosemite Lodge at the Falls (lodge rooms $199+), or the Ahwahnee (standard rooms $449+). Curry Village (unheated tent cabins), Housekeeping Camp (topless cabins) , and Camp 4 campgrounds are closed due to inclement weather.5 Outside the valley, there is Evergreen Lodge outside Groveland 33 miles from the Valley, and Yosemite View in El Portal , 14 miles from the Valley. Wawona lodge 33 miles south.6. The main entry points into the Park are highway 120 in the north, 140 in the center, and 41 in the south. 7. We drive from Silicon Valley to Yosemite Valley in 5 hours, carrying tire tension cables for travel in snow, through highway 140. I test fit the cables on my car, making sure that the sharp ends of the cables are away from the tire. 8. Chain controls in effect on highway 120 and highway 41 park entry points. All vehicles must either have snow tires (mud/snow tires) mounted, or carry tire chains/cables.9. Park employees inspect all tires on all vehicles looking for the mud/snow tire side imprint. Vehicles including 4 wheel drive vehicles without snow tires, and without tire chains, are denied entry into the park.10. Quick moving local snow storms possible November-April, when all vehicles required to carry chains. In 2014 there was a snow storm in May, with chain controls on highway 140. Some people got stuck overnight in the park when they couldn't exit due to no chains! 11. $30 entry fee per vehicle, credit cards preferred, good for 7 days. You must show the receipt when exiting the park. Don't be stupid and look for your missing entry fee receipt on the floor of the car, holding up other cars exiting! 12. We use the $10 national parks lifetime pass for persons 62 + -hey we only have so many good years left! 13. We stop by Bridalveil Falls at the start of the valley, as it is 6 miles from the hotels -not easy walking distance, and not on the free bus shuttle route.14. The wife uses the unlighted pit toilets here (breath through your mouth, not your nose!), and no running water.15. Next we drive 1 mile toward Glacier Point, stopping at the tunnel view, at the head of the Wawona tunnel, the longest tunnel in California, with a panoramic view of the valley from El Capitan to Bridalveil falls.16. Glacier point road is closed due to snow, and Sentinal Peak hike is not accessible until later in the spring.17. We drive to the Ahwahnee with it's 4 pm checkin. The Lodge has a 5pm check in time, so don't whine if you get there at 4pm and your room is not ready!18. Next day we have a 1215pm brunch date, and do some hiking beforehand, hiking from the Ahwahnee to Yosemite Village, and the visitor's center with it's Indian museum and exhibits, and film.19. We hike on over to lower Yosemite falls, and then to the Lodge, to check on the menu of the Mountain Room restaurant, and then hike back to the Ahwahnee.20. A the far end of Yosemite Lodge is Camp 4, a first come first served camp area, and the staging area for the Upper Yosemite Falls hike.21. Back at the Ahwahnee we feast on the superb Sunday brunch, and waddle back to our room, take a nap, and go comatose getting used to the 4000 foot elevation.22. It rains the next day, so we hike to Yosemite Village, and then around Cook's meadow, past the Chapel, past the Swinging Bridge, with Yosemite Falls in the background, swirling in and out of the incoming fog and mist.23. We go up the Four Mile Trail for a short ways just to get above the trees, with a view of the Valley. This day long hiking trail leads to Glacier Point, but there is no bus to take you back down to the Valley, as Glacier Point Road is closed.24. We walk over the Swinging Bridge, and Merced River, with Yosemite Falls looming in the backgound, amid the mist, and over to the Lodge, eating lunch at the Lodge Food Court.25. The sun comes out. We catch the free Yosemite bus shuttle, going from the Ahwahnee, past Yosemite Village, past the Lodge, past Lower Yosemite Falls, Housekeeping Camp, Curry Village, Happy Isles, to the Mirror Lake stop.26. 1 mile uphill paved hike to Mirror Lake, accessible only by walking or taking the free shuttle. The afternoon clouds part, the sun appears, and we get the shot of lifetime of the lake with the reflection of the brown bushes, the green trees, and the white granite masses altogether.27. Next day, we take the shuttle from the Ahwahnee, past Yosemite Village, the Lodge, Curry Village to Happy Isles, and do the Mist trail, to the top of Vernal Falls. 28. This is a short hike but with 1000 feet elevation gain in the last half mile -not for those with bad knees! I'm breathing like Darth Vader, huffing and puffing up the 600+ stone stairs and boulder steps!29. Beyond Vernal Falls is Nevada Falls, and then Half Dome, accessible only in the summer with a permit obtained by lottery pick. That involved climbing steel cable ladders anchored by steel bolts driven into the granite.30. We have reservations for the Lodge in May and will go to Glacier Point and Sentinal Dome at that time.31. In the summer we will stay at Tioga Pass resort on the eastern edge of the park, on Tioga Road past wood burning heated tent cabins at White Wolf and Tuolumne Meadows, seeing Olmstead Point, Tenaya Lake, Tuolumne Meadows, Lembert Dome, doing the Glen Aulen hike. 32. Shelved for the future: Hetch Hetchy hikes in the north, and Redwoods near Wawona in the south.","March 8, 2015",32 tips for enjoying Yosemite Valley,1950,"Sunnyvale, CA",5
Yosemite Valley,"If you like the works of Ansel Adams then Yosemite is the place you have to visit. That’s the motivation bringing me to the national park in the first place.After arriving at the park, I must say that seeing the park with your own eyes is something totally different from looking at all the photos available online. You must see it yourself to believe in the difference.The park is huge – it’s easily an hour’s drive from the park gate to the village inside the valley. We traveled on RV, so we stayed at the upper pines camp ground for three days in February. However, due to the drought, we missed some attractions (Horsetail Fall was missing due to shortage of snow) but there were also places that were open which would normally be unavailable at this time of the year.Like what others say, the valley offers a wide range of hiking trails – from easy ones such as the valley loop (flat but long walk) to challenging climbs (we tried the hike to Vernal Falls at the last part involving the climb up the granite steps was quite scary). There were also free shuttle bus serving bus stops along Yosemite Village, Curry Village, campsites, and trail entrances. They’re quite nice to have, especially for those who need to visit the village stores to pick up supplies or the restaurants/food court to enjoy a hot meal. Though be warned that many businesses in the valley close early. Also, the shower room in curry village is clean and available free of charge during winter season, allowing us to reduce the need of using the vehicle’s water supply.If you do visit this place, you definitely want to spend time checking out some of the famous locations such as Yosemite Falls, El Capitan, and Half Dome (from the Sentinel Bridge – there’s a bus stop right next to it).I’d say if possible, stay for at least 3 days in the valley. For those who enjoy hiking, there are just so many trails and hikes to explore. Of course, for photo enthusiasts, traveling to some of the more famous locations would take some time – not to mention the randomness in weather and conditions (I had to wait for sunset at Sentinel Bridge for 3 days – and only had one chance for a clear shot at the red half dome). Also, remember to bring a flashlight – it can get quite dark in the night.","March 8, 2015",The Must-visit Destination for Nature Photographers,88,"Taipei, Taiwan",5

Yosemite Valley,"Never will you ever see so many awesome sites all in one place. The valley loop is not that large. There so many sites to see, and hikes to take. From short walks to Yosemite Falls and Bridleveil Falls to more strenuous hikes up the unforgetable mist trail, you will never forget Yosemite Valley. The Valley has multiple waterfalls and the most incredible rock faces. Bring your binoculars to spot rock climbers. Of course if you are a waterfall enthusiast you should go in May through July. Yet the summer gets crowded. We like to go last week of May or first week of June. On a slightly windy day is the best time to take the walk to Bridleveil Falls. Honestly beautiful when the wind makes it look like a literal huge bridle veil. In the summer I highly recommend you tube or boat down the Merced through the valley. Usually not scary or rough, just gorgeous scenery. Also there's a bike path in the Valley, so bring your bikes or rent them there. Don't miss a visit to the Awanee Hotel with it's Indian motif.

Yosemite Valley,"I am from GA and this is one of those places that has been on my bucket list. The mountains were breaktakingly large and I enjoyed seeing the Sequoia's for the first time. Unfortunately it was very dry so the waterfalls were but a trickle and the river was very low. We drove in from the central valley and I was shocked at how dead everything was, it was very sad.

There is a free shuttle that helps on air pollution (& gas) and I was told even in the winter some buses run some of the time. You have to park in a huge lot, and go maybe 10 minutes walking to the Visitor Center (there is a handicap area closer). There are big and little stores (such as the Ansel Adams gift store & post office) to met your needs, and lodging. You can see the Dome, from a distance & get a great photo; and walk to Bridal Falls & more. The Visitor Ctr. has all you need; very complete info and friendly.

It's well worth taking the time to familiarize yourself with the park amenities and roads (including off season closures) in advance to take best advantage of your time. Staying in Groveland made it possible to spend several hourse in the park each day without having to pay in park lodging prices. Less convenient perhaps, but the drive in is nice. Trails, althougth well maintained, didn't have excellent markings which made finding trail heads challenging. We didn't quite manage the hike to the top of the falls, but the bottom of the falls was fantastic.

Yosemite Valley,"We travelled into Yosemite National Park from the top right hand corner on the Tiogga Pass Road from Lone Pine. It took all day to drive down to the valley floor to the Yosemite village & out of the park via Mariposa. We stayed 2 nights @ Oakhurst which was about a half hour drive into the park the next day. On the day we drove through we stopped a fair few times to enjoy the views & to take some marvellous photos. We didn't see any bears but lots of bear signs. We saw chipmunks, birds, deer & squirrels & a coyote. Yosemite village is popular & the car park gets quite full. It is a one way road on the valley floor around the village so sat navy's get a bit confused. There are plenty of interesting places in the village to visit & also to stop & eat at. The old post office is an interesting place to stop & you can get your passport stamped there which is a novelty. The granite mountains of Half Dome , El Capitan, Cathedral & the others are truly a sight to behold. The second day we went back to Mariposa Grove where the giant sequoia trees are. We paid to go on a train around the grove which took about 1 1/2 hours which was very interesting learning about the trees, their history, ages , names & able to stop for photos, they give you head phones to listen to the story. The sequoias are fantastic to see a definite must see. We stopped @ Mariposa golf shop & had a coffee with a hotdog, the best hotdog I have ever tasted. The lady who worked in the golf shop was very friendly & gave good service. It costs $20 admission in to the National Park & you can return for a week on that ticket, well worth the money. Make sure you have plenty of fuel in your car before entering the park as there are few garages available for fuel & also water to drink.","January 19, 2015",An everchanging landscape,13,"Wroughton, United Kingdom",5

What I really want to do is to visit in the springtime, bring a chair, food, stake out a spot and just absorb the scenery from sunrise to sunset! National treasure isn't a grand enough title...P.S. I've never had crappier food (Yosemite Lodge food court) and hear that all food to purchase in the Valley is terrible (with the possible exception of the magnificent Awahnee Hotel) so bring your own if you're picky.

Yosemite Valley,"I love National Parks!!! I absolutely love them! I have visited most of the best known US National Parks, but had yet to visit Yosemite. Now that I have, I shall definitely visit again.As Ansel Adams has chronicled Yosemite's beauty in his iconic photos, I'll skip the verbiage on why it is so amazing and instead will skip to tips, so that you readers can maximize your visits.I visited in late November: a tricky time as it snows (the main road had just closed during my visit and the Glacier Point road closed during my visit, thankfully the day after I had scaled it with abandon), but also lovely as there are relatively few visitors and so one can explore in peace.On exploring alone: Due to my sensitivity to dryness and altitude, I got a nosebleed while walking through the Mariposa Valley, and saw no other hikers for about 30 minutes. This cause quite a bit of angst on my part, as I was thoroughly preoccupied by the idea of having my face eaten off by a bear. So imagine a lone traveler, trying to lick her own blood off her face because she had run out of water (no, you can't use a tissue as it would either be littering or a HUGE form of bait; and, yes, licking your own blood off your face is truly disgusting) while shouting BOO! at the top of her lungs to scare any critters away from her. That I had recently met up with a fearless coyote who would have sprung into my car for food only added to my paranoia. So I would 1) ensure that your nose is pre-treated with Vaseline or somesuch before hiking and b) carry literal bells or whistles with you when hiking.The Yosemite roads are unfathomably winding and sloping, and yet the locals are used to this sort of driving. So if you are driving at or even above the speed limit, you will annoy them and may even cause an accident as they take the turns at Mario Andretti velocities. Add complete winter darkness and sleet to the equation and you have a recipe for, if not disaster, intense discomfort. As such, I would advise that first time visitors get on the road well before sunset (I would say at the very least one hour, but two is better), particularly if you are not staying within the park. Yosemite is ginormous, and you will suddenly find that what you thought was a ""15-minute escapade"" in daylight is actually a ""90-minute roller coaster from hell"" at night.Bring lots of layers, especially waterproof ones, and plan your hikes in advance. And, of course, bring water. I always try to do this, but because of Yosemite's ever-changing climate and rigorous topography, it is all the more important (you never know when a nosebleed or blizzard may strike)!Above all, have a great time! Careful planning will allow you to lose yourself it Yosemite's ethereal beauty and will also give you a new appreciation for nature's extraordinary light, as every single stage of it gives you a new perspective. Being in Yosemite is in many ways like being in the center of a crystal prism, which is why Ansel Adams so loved it.

Yosemite Valley,"In addition to the lack of crowds (and sleeping snakes), if you're lucky, it will have just rained - and the falls will be running.

However, we did find it hard to ride when there are lots of people walking on the bike trails, especially around each of the hotels. Still, what a great way to past time. We rode for 2.5 hours but were charged for only 2 hours. Totally worth the $90 for our family of four. There were bikes and helmets for adults and children. They have tandem bikes as well. There are bike racks everywhere so parking is never an issue, and it's safe as well.

Yosemite Valley,"If only the guests in our country were more respectful of wildlife, plants and others, this wonderful place would be so much more enjoyable. I have been visiting this jewel since the early 50's and have observed and heard the pronounced decline in peaceful coexistence with nature. When I visit Yosemite, it is to enjoy tranquility and beauty and have had the privilege of doing so in every season and by staying in each level of accommodation from backpacking tent camping to the Ahwahnee Hotel. Each subsequent visit becomes more and more disappointing with our national treasure overrun by foreign visitors seeking another tick off their bucket list, showing little respect for what there is to experience and at a deeper level than point-and-click. Shhhhhh. Listen! Look! Sit quietly and see what it is that makes this place so special to us.And, by the way, the ""rules"" in the park are well-publicized and are posted to underscore the importance of preserving the park as it is meant to be experienced and enjoyed by all.

We entered from the east (and left from the east)climbing to almost 10,000 feet in our car. We had a very long drive over a narrow twisty (and sometimes scary) road - but the vistas were stunning. When we got to Yosemite Village we didn't ahve a problem finding a parking place - but it was mid-week in october and, from all reports, it can get horrible crowded in the summer. El Capitan is high - and we were able to see climbers slowly inching there way up the face.

Usually a dry time when the water falls are not at their peak, but we were blessed with an earlier snow fall and some rain. Some of the trees were at their peak fall color and the grasses were a golden color. We did a lot of day hikes and took part in one of the park rangers ""night"" programs. The night sky did not disappoint us. Clear skies with lots of stars, some falling stars, and able to see many constellations. Don't miss Sequoia National Park just south of Yosemite. The Mariposa Grove is a must see too.","November 29, 2014",Yosemite & Sequoia National Park in the Fall,10,"Champaign, Illinois",5

I can honestly say Yosemite exceeded our expectations, and then some.Visiting in mid fall, we were not expecting to see spectacular waterfalls after a hot dry summer, but this did not detract from the experience at all. The scenery and landscape is still spectacular and definitely worth the visit.We were on a self guided road trip, so had the added advantage of visiting not only Yosemite Valley, but driving east through the rest of the national park, and wow!! We were blown away by the constantly changing scenery and how different the eastern side of Yosemite National Park is from the western side.If you are fortunate enough to have the flexibility to do this, highly recommend including the eastern side of the park in your planning, but do check ahead as some of the roads are closed during winter.","November 25, 2014",Exceeded expectations,56,"Melbourne, Australia",5

The Ahwahnee Hotel (circa 1927 vintage) is a wonderful place to stay...with amenities that satisfy. Even if you stay elsewhere in the park you get to experience the superior dining ...BE Sure to reserve early! It fills up fast.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is one of my favorite places in the US and with a few tips, you can enjoy it well. Summer is gruesome, with traffic and people. If it's the only time you can go, then it's still worth it. But be prepared for crowds and long stairs, in everything from walking on the paths, to restaurants and renting bikes. I usually go twice a year, spring and fall, and while it still will have more people than you expected, it is much better than summer. Spring is my favorite time, since there is water for the falls, rafting nearby, and trees are greening. The week BEFORE Memorial Day weekend is best, then get out before the crowd hits on that Holiday Friday. Also can go first or second week of June. After that, it's getting crowded. In the fall try Sept to first week of October. The waterfalls are just trickling at best, but it is still peaceful and beautiful. Ive seen school trips at that time, but it is better than summer.And book a YEAR in advance. Curry Village is my favorite. Convenient location, food, and stores.","November 18, 2014",Must see!,70,"Portland, Oregon",5

Be careful of the traffic though, if you get into the valley early enough then you don't have to pay the tolls and there is no traffic!

We prefer the campsites outside the valley for quietness and nature. We camped at Hodgdon, it was great.

We went biking and swimming at the swinging Bridge and we went fishing.The bad thing about it was that there was a very big fire and it made all the views a lot worse.

Yosemite Valley,"Only a few hours drive from San Francisco, if you are travelling in the South West this should be on the top of your list. To get the most out of it I recommend staying for a few days, either somewhere in the valley (cabins, hotels, camp sites aplenty) or in a nearby hotel/hostel.I'm saying to get the most out of you need a few days for a number of reasons. First, your ticket will allow you to visit the park for a week from the time of purchase. Second, one day is just simply not enough to visit every site within the park, not even for 5 minutes. Believe me, when you're there, you'll want to try every hiking path, see every little brook and just simply gaze at the wonders nature can squeeze in to such a relatively small place.Facilities are pretty good, there are plenty of places to stay overnight or simply park your car. There are a number of catering options, you can have a quick snack, burgers or eat in a proper restaurant.The best thing you can do is bring a bicycle with you (or rent one on-site) and explore the whole valley on your first day. Then you will see where you may want to spend more time and which hiking trails you want to complete.I wish I could have stayed more...","November 11, 2014",Breathtaking,6,"London, United Kingdom",5

Yosemite Valley,"Spent 3 days in the Valley ,overnighting in a cabin in Curry Village. I didn't appreciate the benefit of staying in the Valley until I realized the tough drive in and out of the valley. The high ascent on narrow roads with little or no protection from drop offs , before dropping down into the valley are not easy drives. Yosemite itself is beautiful.. My wife and I were there in late October, beautiful colours, not busy and enjoyed lovely walks and sights. Breakfast at the Avanhee hotel was delightful and I would recommend it as well as seeing the impressive ground floor of the hotel.We drove to Glacier point about an hour from the valley. Again a tough drive but worth it as the view from Glacier point is memorable.. You can also hike to the top and back which we hope to do next time around.. We met a couple in their sixties who had managed it so if you can handle heights it should be doable. Little or no sights of waterfalls which is the disadvantage of visiting in Sept, Oct. We visited Mariposa which was worth it to see the giant red woods.. Major work planned on trails there so check on what you can see before you visit. Be sure to bring a good camera, a couple of torches, a full tank of fuel in your car, warm clothes for night, good walking gear. Your first visit to Yosemite is unlikely to be your only one.. We missed a turn on the way from San Francisco near China camp and went through Jamestown.

The valley is especially beautiful when you're sitting on the bank of the river on a hot summer day with El Capitan on one side the the great Half Dome on the other side while you're enjoying the scenery and having a nice cold drink. Note: Yosemite Valley and Glacier Point are the two most crowded spots of the entire park. You should def go there but I wouldn't stick around there for too long. Take a look at the park map and travel to the more remote areas of the park. They are all equally as beautiful.","November 10, 2014",Unlike any other valley,69,"Rockville, Maryland",5

From seeing first-hand the damage wrought by the Rim fire in 2013 (we could not go near the area affected by the current fires) and a small recent fire, we were greatly touched by just how fragile the balance of nature is and how devastating results can come from inadvertent actions by humans. We also saw how resilient nature is -- illustrated by how the landscape has been carved and reshaped over centuries, and how people, literally, go to great heights to seek thrills as we watched people carrying up to 200 pounds of equipment on their backs as they embarked on a four-day trip to scale the shear-sided El Capitan. The sites were breath-taking and everything we saw during this day trip led by Extranomical Tours, was very informative and amazing. I would recommend Extranomical Tours any time.

If you have not had the opportunity to visit Yosemite, find a way to do so. And make sure you include the stunning views from Glacier Point. I'm not a hiker or climber, but the roads were plentiful enough that I could drive to as much of the park as I desired. By coming in early June, the park was crowded, but not nearly as much as I suspect it normally gets once vacation season kicks into high gear. It's definitely one of those places that doesn't disappoint. My only quibble was that I only allowed myself a few hours, rather than a few days, in which to see all I could.

Conveniently, one of the stops is at the location that has two food choices--one café and one sandwich shop. The trolleys were dependable all day to arrive every 15 minutes for pick-up at each stop.

However, a visit during the last few months of the year, when we did it this time, has its own particular charm, and you won't fight traffic. There was still a lot of fall color in evidence (though our visit was right on the October/November boundary; it could have waned by the middle of November). We enjoyed ourselves immensely, and would recommend this for anyone's *second* visit to the Valley.","October 28, 2014",This has to be on your lifetime list of things to do!,586,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",5
Yosemite Valley,"Of course the rock formations like Half Dome and El Capitan were wonderful and saw a lot of wildlife, but there was no water coming down the falls because of the drought. That was disappointing. I was told they won't be active again until the spring. The valley itself is very commercialized with all of the souvenir shops. Ansel Adams store was the only one worth going through unless you're looking for t-shirts, food or drinks. The pioneer cemetery was interesting. There is a free shuttle that stops at 16 points along the way. This is a great way to conserve energy for hiking later.","October 26, 2014","No Water - Commercial, but pretty",53,"Kansas City, Missouri",4

Yosemite Valley,"We stayed in the housekeeping camp for two nights in October. The drive from San Francisco was great. The valley is surrounded all round by tall redwood trees. We managed to see deer in the camp ground and a bear in the nearby curry village. The camp itself is very basic. You can rent blankets, pillows and bed sheets for the stay but the temperature at night drops really low. Despite having two blankets for every person, it was cold. It would be advisable to either get your own sleeping bags or get extra blanket. We went to sentinel dome which is a medium level trek and there is iceberg point and other trails. The food facilities in the curry village are very good and before a hectic day you can have a good breakfast and fill up your water bottles. We visited Olmsteadt point, lake Tenaya and Soda springs. To visit these places you need car but are worth a visit. We did stargazing at night. It was amazing as the sky is perfectly clear and the area is pitch dark as there are no street lightings. It was a perfect setting for stargazing and the experience was great.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite is a beautiful park full of wonderful hikes and staggering views. Although its a vast place, you can hit all the key sites in a few days. Yosemite offers a free shuttle bus to take you to various hikes, water falls and lodges. We were there in Oct and the weather was spectacular. It was in the 70's during the day with a bright blue sky and 50's at night. However the fall is also the dry season and as such Yosemite Falls was dry. Vernal Falls and Nevada Falls has some water but not much. The Merced River that runs through Yosemite Valley was also very low and slow moving. You can choose long arduous hikes, or short site-seeing walks - your choice.There are two villages located there, Yosemite and Curry. Both offer simple food, lots of free water, easy access to coffee and has a grocery store with wine, beer, supplies and of course food. Internet is only available in the two lodges or in the Curry camp meeting house - which gets crowded at night but was very enjoyable to hang out in. No TVs, just people (campers) reading and relaxing.","October 22, 2014",Beautiful outdoor adventure,50,Westborough MA,5
Yosemite Valley,"This is a park we always wanted to see. Many people have told us about it, so when we finally had the opportunity, we jumped on it. We entered from the east. The scenery was spectacular! It took a while to go to the west and then drop down into the valley itself. We noted with interest that the main road across the valley is actually divided, and two lanes each way - a little like a freeway. We wondered if that would mean a lot of people are there! There were. Lots! We only had two nights here, so we had to specifically plan what we wanted to do. On the day we arrived, we were dumbfounded as we watched about 11 climbers scaling El Capitan! Just watching it made our hands sweat. You've got to have a good set of binoculars to see this. We then hiked up to Angel Falls - beautiful to watch the wind blow the water around! Next, we parked and finally discovered the shuttle system. We took it over to the walk that leads to Mirror Lake. This was an easy walk in the beautiful woods and ends right below Half Dome, which actually doesn't look very spectacular from that angle. The next day, we walked a large portion of the Valley Floor Loop, a very pleasant walk along the river and through the woods. This pretty much exhausted us. In the afternoon, we drove up to Glacier Point to view the breathtaking panorama of the valley from above. Amazing!What we liked:1. The very pleasant and quiet walks through the woods. It was cool and dry, and very few people on the trail.2. The view of El Capitan and Half Dome from various points. The falls were dry, but we could see where they fall from.What we didn't like:1. Actually, the valley floor is quite full of trees. While they're beautiful, they also block the view of the mountains in most places.2. The crowds! Even though this was a time of year when the numbers are lower, there were still WAY too many people.3. The valley at the one end is very full of all sorts of overnight lodging - anything from mini tents, to campers, to what looked like wooden boxes with tarps spread over them, to cabins, etc. it just didn't seem to end. In some ways, it seemed like a city. The shuttles reminded us of inner-city bus routes. It took away from the vision I had in my mind of a beautiful, serene valley....In our view, if you have aday or two, you would come if you want to see the falls (springtime), and the two major rock faces. Once you've seen them from several points, there doesn't seem like much reason to stay - unless, of course, you like walking or hiking and you want to spend time doing that. Lots of opportunities for those activities.","October 21, 2014",Worth a visit!,218,South Africa,4
Yosemite Valley,"It is small wonder that Yosemite's 3600 sq km attracts an incredible 4 million people to California's Sierra Nevada annually. That's a lot of bodies glistening with perspiration, aspirations and excitement. With granite mountains that hulk skyward and giant sequoias that have habitated this region since the middle Ages, the meadows and waterfalls create Yosemite as a premier address. My femme and i revelled in our experience of exploring the park, when the full moon was out, when it is the most dreamiest or as the sun goes down and the crowds fade. A ghostly glow descends on the valley, and the waterfalls become brilliant streaks of white. I am indebted to a hostess at our hotel in Carmel who recounted her experiences with different times to visit the region. Tram rides is the best way to get a 360 degree view of the entire park.

Yosemite Valley,"We availed of the free shuttle bus, hopping off and on at various spots and going for a walk now and then. We also went to the film and visited the museum and Indian village. We had come on the free shuttle from Wawona which left at 8.30 a.m. from there, returning at 3.30 pm., so did not have much time for extensive walks. Had a wander in the meadow area, but as it was September, not much in the way of flowers, just some dried grasses. Also no water in Mirror lake and just a tiny bit in the river. But the rocks and mountains above were spectacular and the trees so tall, even up on what looked like impossible mountains.","October 21, 2014",Free shuttle bus,199,"Dublin, Ireland",5

Yosemite Valley,"Five trips since 2002, each memorable. Your first view of Half Dome, the waterfalls and the valley if you are coming from the west will amaze you.

As you approach and drive through the valley, El Capitan, the other monoliths, and waterfalls, with the Merced flowing through the middle, let the immensity, power and beauty of Yosemite wash over you. The most impressive and beautiful place I have ever scene. Get out of your car and hike the valley, it will allow you to appreciate its grandeur even more. Although there are many nice places to stay outside Yosemite, plan your trip well in advance at stay in the Valley. Campsites, camp tents, cabins, the Lodge at the Falls and the Awahnee run the gamut of cheap to expensive, but staying in the Valley allows you more time there. But make sure to take some hikes and side trips to hike in the other areas of this wonderful park, like Tulomine Meadows and the High Country. All of it is accessible from about Memorial Day to October, although early and late there may be snow at higher elevations. Some of the best photographic opportunities in the world.

Yosemite Valley,"We just returned from a couple of days in Yosemite National Park. This is the first time we visited in the month of October. This is one month that a visit may be unwise.First, all of the waterfalls are dry. Since waterfalls are a major attraction for the park, a visit when they are flowing is a better time to visit.Next, California has had a lot of wild fires in recent years and October is within prime fire season. When we went, one of the park entrances was closed by a fire and smoke permeated Yosemite Valley. Detours are long and winding. The weather was sunny and mild, so if one is flexible enough to move activities to a smoke free area, then one can still enjoy the park.Next, the park concessionaire winds down operations in October. No food or gasoline was available at Tuolumne Meadows and the better appointed restrooms at the higher elevation were locked up for the season despite the presence of large numbers of visitors. Services should be available until the Tioga Road is closed. In Yosemite Valley, we tried to get dinner at the Ahwanee lodge restaurant. The restaurant looked half empty, but the maître'd would not give us a table unless an existing reservation was cancelled. No reservation was available for the entire week, according to the web site. We were told that we would probably be seated if we waited until 9PM; we were first in line at 5:30PM. We ate elsewhere. No use patronizing a business that does not want ours.On a similar subject, prices charged by the park concessionaire seem unreasonably high when services are available. For example, Chevron gasoline is over one dollar a gallon higher than in the San Joaquin Valley, only 60 miles away. The service station was only open on a Thursday from 10AM to 4PM, with self serve credit card only outside of those banker's hours. This is bogus.Motel/Hotel accommodations are probably $100+ per night higher than comparable facilities outside the park. Restaurant menu prices also seem unreasonably high.One would expect a public park to have facilities available for all segments of society, but it appears that this park only caters to the wealthy. The difficulty in even booking a room within the park leads a reasonable person to believe that insiders receive preferential treatment when it comes to access to facilities and services. The old Yosemite Park and Curry Company did a much better job of providing access to a diversity of visitors.  Large areas of the park have had forest fires and the charred remains of thousands of trees spoil the experience. Management of the forest by the National Park Service is disappointing. The way large areas are being burned off, it appears that eventually there will be no forest left.Perhaps ""global warming"" or ""climate change"" deserves some of the blame, but the controlled burn program seems ineffective in preventing large conflagrations. If you plan to visit the park, your best bet is to stay outside of it. Eat your meals outside the park or carry your food in. Fill your gas tank before you enter the park. If you decide that you must use a service provided by the park concessionaire, make advance reservations and expect to be gouged. The Park Service says it cannot understand why visits to Yosemite are down. One reason is the lack of affordability. Another reason is the mediocrity of the services. Finally, the degradation of the environment makes it less of a destination than it used to be. As a visitor of many years, I have witnessed the decline of this crown jewel. It still is one of the most beautiful places on earth and a thrill for every first time visitor who is able to afford the experience. The lament is that a visit could be so much better than it is. The park should belong to everyone, but it doesn't.","October 9, 2014",October Is Not A Good Month To Visit,268,Modesto,2

Yosemite Valley,"We visited Yosemite Valley in the winter, when the water-falls are but a trickle, but that did not in any way take away the awesomeness of the place. El-Capitan, the Sentinel Dome and the Half Dome will leave you in awe. It's beautiful driving around the valley and finding your own personal space. It's not unusual to come across wild life - we came across a herd of deer - crossing the road. The reflections of El-Capitan in the streams make for some lovely photo-ops. A dear friend advised us that we couldn't come to California and not visit Yosemite - and that couldn't be truer! Yosemite is beauty personified and a wonder to treasure!

Yosemite Valley,We went as a couple in September. All the waterfalls were dry which was a shame. Not as well signposted as I would have liked. We did a walk we had printed out in England and found the signs were almost non existent. Make sure you go to the visitor center and speak to Rangers they know a lot. Lastly go to the theatre and see the 2 films they show as they explain lots. Enough said,"September 30, 2014",Slightly disappointed,117,"Ipswich, United Kingdom",4
Yosemite Valley,"The crowds and the traffic here can be unbelievable. You'll feel like you are in line at an amusement park. But there is really nothing like this place in the spring time. At least nothing that I've seen. Huge water falls, granite cliffs, rushing streams, and deer wandering around like an animated Disney movie. Words can not do it justice.

First thing that greated me wa El Capitan. I'll never forget the first moments I saw this ginormous piece of granite. The shuttle system was a convenient way to get around, because driving around I actually got lost a couple times. If deciding to come on a busy holiday weekend, be patient. The bus may pass you a few times.The camp grounds were well kept and clean. Each campside had It's on own bear locker.

Yosemite Valley,"This is a little piece of heaven, where so much to do and see, a place where you can find cascading falls,meadows, river, granite mountains, lake, wildlife, lovely trees and beautiful trails. It was like the Disneyland of the wilderness. Visited last week of April when the weather was almost perfect - cold, crisp air,clear sky and bright sun. So peaceful and most of all no big crowd. Did easy hike (or stroll) to Yosemite falls approx 1/2 mile each way. Saw herd of deer few times on different places. Amazing sight every where we look, plenty of pull outs and gorgeous spot for photo op. If you're not driving, there's a shuttle that will take you around the valley floor. There's a store/ gift shop located in the village, where you can find almost every thing you need on your trip. The only gas station inside the park is in Wawona, less than an hour drive from the valley and few miles away from south entrance.","September 28, 2014",Place Like No Other,21,"Westminster, California",5

So by the time we got to our destination it was light out, and I said to my husband ""OMG"" look up! The mountains were so high and beautiful. This is how New York effective me when I saw Times Square on the evening I arrived. There are certain things you need to see for your self, a picture does not do it justice. I think that Las Vegas had the same effect on me.We took the grand tour, with the lunch option, which also was a good choice. You who wants to drive and miss out on the beautiful view.

On checking afterwards, we found we could have saved up to $30 per person for Exactly the same tour, driver and schedule. Really annoying.

Yosemite Valley,"Visited here for two days and it was fantastic. Even though we were able to hike, there was much to see and do. We entered the park from the South entrance at Fish Camp which is close to the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias and Wawona, a lodge and restaurant area. As we traveled the one hour drive to Yosemite Valley we got our first views after passing through tunnel rock. Stop here! The entire valley is laid out before you for must do pictures. The valley floor is pretty narrow but well laid out. Less traffic in the Fall. Must stops include Bridal Veil Falls and Yosemite Village. Go to the museum and Indian Village and get a postcard stamped and mailed. Decent sandwiches in the deli are a good idea unless you are staying at one of the lodges. Later, take the winding road to Glacier Point for astounding views at 8000 feet and a birdseye view of the valley floor below you. Its woth the drive, trust me!

Yosemite Valley,"My 6 friends and I booked a camping trip to Yosemite for Labor Day Weekend. You can get into the park for $20 per vehicle for a 7 day period. Nice! We ended up camping at Summerdale Campground, which was only 1.5 miles from the south entrance of Yosemite National Park. The area was absolutely breath-taking and the hikes were gorgeous. As there were 7 of us we did the moderate hikes, but there's something for all levels. None of the waterfalls had water due to the drought and the grass was pretty yellow due to the drought, but the scenery was still stunning. You could see where the wildfires from last year took place as there was a burnt area towards the north end of the park. All in all, Yosemite is a must-see for any bucketlist. The cost between the 7 of us, including a rental car, gas, the campsite, vehicle fees, entrance fees, firewood, and food only took us back $125 each.

The park is easy to enjoy because of the bus system. Very little walking is required. The park is always crowded in the summer, so spring or fall would be easier to get around. There is a grove of Sequoia trees if you leave the park thru Oakhurst, which is a must see.

(hold on to your hat or cap has the wind can lift it off) there are stops on the way around for photos etc but on can get a sore neck for looking up a lot, the tour takes about 45 minutes. there are plenty of short bike and walks you can take as well plus there are camp spots to stay at. with it been so dry in the state the where no water falls to see.

Yosemite Valley,"The weather was quite pleasant- a nice temperature morning, day and evening. The park is well taken care of if a little crowded. The first day we enjoyed a short-ish trek to (the currently non-existent) Mirror Lake, followed by time spent at the little beach right near the Pines campgrounds- very pleasant. A whole family of deer came up to take a drink right while I was sitting there near the crystal-clear stream. The hike to Vernal Falls is a good one to take if you start fairly early, around 8. It's shaded most of the way, so, even if it gets hotter- you're covered by the trees. No sign of fire damage in the Valley, just on the way to the park. Free wi-fi in Curry Village but it was down when we were there. We did find wi-fi for $5.95 per day at Yosemite Lodge. Everywhere you look it's spectacular. The buses are a handy addition, and good for the trees! They take you anywhere you want to go.

Truly a highlight of my 50 years on this earth, will never forget it.

We went in September and there was only one space available. So book early. They have an amazing free shuttle service with nice drivers (Thanks Anthony!). This allows you to park your car/rv and jump on and off the shuttle as it goes all over the park. Unfortunately we went during a big forest fire time and it was quite smokey.

Yosemite Valley,"Well, what can I say about such a wonderful place. The vistas are amazing, even with the drought, and no water running in the waterfalls, nor in Mirror lake. I wish I could have seen more water in the park, but it wasn't to be this year (2014). My favorite place was Tuolumne Meadow, WOW! there was water up there, and at Lake Tanaya. It was wonderfully calm, serene and crowds were minimal in September. It was just perfect.There were some fires happening, but they were under control enough that it didn't hinder our visit. We smelled smoke, and did see some smoke in areas, but nothing bad.Went with friends who had twins, 17 months old. We did fine, just found some shorter hikes, and off we went! I will say, in Awahnee Lodge, we went to the buffet breakfast - for $25! It was worth it. I am glad we got to experience this beautiful old lodge, and paying that price - which was the most reasonable between the 3 meals in a day - was worth it. The staff were very accommodating, especially with 2 young ones. Many of the staff told us they had worked at the lodge for 25 and 30 years! Their kindness and smiles were refreshing and made the experience so very nice. The food was very nicely prepared, we especially liked the banana creme. Glacier point is a beautiful vista, worth the drive, but if there had been more visitors in the park, I would not have wanted to drive there with a long line of cars the whole way. The park had many areas to relax, walk, and picnic in the Valley area, and it was a bit of a drive to get anywhere else. Expect to be in the car for periods of time to get from one place to another. It is technical driving (mountain driving with many curves) so it isn't like driving in a straight line.We did use the shuttle system to get to one of the hikes - it was very easy to use, and the routes are marked very well. I would use this to get around the park as it got busy during high season. The one thing I don't understand about the park is the line to get out of it! They check if you have a receipt or pass when leaving the park. We rented a place outside the park, so on the second night, I asked why? The park ranger told me that they don't man the kiosks all night, and that allows for people to enter the park without paying. Why in heaven's name would they make everyone wait in line to leave the park? This is insanity. I can't imagine that there are more than a handful of people taking advantage of this to get in free. And even if there are, I have never had to wait in line to leave a national park. Why don't they use a license capturing technology (re: tollway cameras) or have the people who are entering the park pay on the honor system (as I have done in other parks in the system)The insanity of this boggles my mind. I understand that they don't want to miss the entry fee for those people, but I cannot understand a system that is set up to catch maybe 1% or less of the users, while making the majority of the visitors use precious resources, such as the gasoline used to idle for long lines waiting to get out. I thought that the park system is trying to cut down on this type of detrimental exhaust to the ecosystem to help maintain a more pristine environment. Whoever thought this solution to the problem needs to re-think it, and come up with a solution that pollutes the air less, makes the customer the priority, and makes the park its fair share as well. (see suggestions above) This really left a bad taste in my mouth, and took my rating of the park down a couple of notches. All in all, I am glad to have had a long weekend in Yosemite, and can't wait to go again and see more. I think this is the type of park that is done in stages, taking small bites out of the different areas. It's just too far and difficult to try to do all the park in one visit, unless you have 6-10 days. So we will focus our attention on one area next time, and relax a bit more.","September 18, 2014",Stark Beauty,61,"Carmel, Indiana",4

Yosemite Valley,"Even though I came all the way from Toronto to Yosemite because I knew it would be beautiful, the views still blew me away. We camped in the valley (lower pines site #1) and while it was close to a lot of amazing hiking trails, a few things took away from the experience. Firstly, some of the campsites in the valley are just awful. Lower pines is fine, but pick the farthest site away from the road that you can get. Roads are busy at all hours of the day and the shuttle buses especially are pretty noisy. Secondly, $5 for a shower is outrageous. I realize California is in a drought but I just couldn't justify paying that when every other campground I've been to has free showers. We ended up sponge bathing at the campsite instead, haha. Lastly, if you've come to Yosemite to be surrounded by nature and get away from the hustle and bustle of the city...I recommend avoiding Curry Village and the Village Store like the plague. The valley is a great place to stay because of its proximity to some amazing hiking trails, but we spent as little time as possible in the village because it was just too commercial for a camping trip.","September 17, 2014","a bit commercial, but beautiful",72,,5

Yes, there are crowds, especially in the summer and on weekends, but with good planning one can get around some of that. We were just there last month and the only falls that were flowing were Nevada and Vernal. We've been there in the spring in the past when all the falls were flowing and it was amazing. As far as places to stay and eat, you'll have to do some research. Places to stay other than camping are few and far between and expensive for what you get. Most of the food services are average at best. In fact, to me, the whole park is under serviced, but maybe that's a good thing. Just enjoy the natural surroundings.

Yosemite Valley,"My husband and I spent one week in Yosemite National Park, the first time for both of us. Because of our naïveté we thought the Park would not be crowded in mid-September. We were wrong.We chose to stay in Yosemite Valley since this was our first visit. The mountains were breathtaking and overwhelming. There was abundant, tame wildlife throughout the Valley. We stayed at Yosemite Lodge at the Falls. On our next visit to the Park, we will NOT be staying at that facility. It is incredibly over-priced, simply because of its location. At $230/night, before tax and fees, it is insulting. Upon checking into the room the first thing to jump out at us were the multiple dirty, black soiled spots on the carpet in the room. The walls are terribly thin. There are louvered coverings on the balcony doors, both the functioning door and the stationary door. Only the handles on the stationary door's louvers worked. To close/open the louvers on the other door you had to manually close/open them from the exterior. The balcony appeared to have last been swept, oh, maybe 6 months ago. The outdoor furniture wasn't bad since it was metal mesh (didn't collect leaves, food and dirt). I placed some brochures on the bottom shelf of my night stand to look at once I went to bed. Big mistake. Later, when I pulled the brochures off the bottom shelf and began to read them as I was lying in bed, a sprinkle of gritty dust fell onto my arms and top bed sheet. Prior to that I had been walking barefooted in the room only to find pubic hairs and tiny bits of gravel between my toes. After that I only wore socks or shoes when pattering around in the room.  I had a coffee mug leave a ring on the round table in the room on our second morning there. Five days later, the ring was still there. I will give housekeeping that they replenished our towels daily and changed the sheets on our bed twice during our stay, which was wonderful!Understandably, there were LOTS of people checking in on the Friday night. Our new neighbors began their party a little after 7:00. By 10:00 the noise level had exceeded the floor fan, which we used for white noise. People were screaming, laughing, trying to open the adjoining door between our rooms. We called the front desk and they said they would send security right away. They did! That was another positive for the Lodge. Our neighbors were quiet after security showed up at their door.So, two positives for Yosemite Lodge at the Falls: location and personnel (other than housekeeping). The Ansel Adams Photo Walking Tour, given through the Ansel Adams Gallery, was superb. Christine, our guide, was very helpful with photography tips and instruction, she was very knowledgeable and seemed to enjoy what she was doing.The Yosemite Valley Stables has a 2-hour, round-trip guided trail ride to Mirror Lake. We enjoyed our horses but were disappointed in the ride. The guides seemed so burned out with their jobs and just wanted to get the ride done. We were looking forward to seeing Mirror Lake at the turn around point of the ride. What a joke. There is no lake and there hasn't been for a number of years. Why advertise the ride as going to a lake?! We would have appreciated their being honest on the front side about the dried up lake. Another alternative would be to think creatively and offer a different trail ride to offer for the same amount of time. We were so disenchanted with the stables that we did not go on our other trail ride we had scheduled for 2 days later.We enjoyed our hikes, bike rental in the Valley, Valley Floor Tour and the food at The Mountain Room and Bar, Degnan's Deli, and the Ahwahnee Hotel and Bar. The free shuttle is priceless for getting around. We could park our car and not have to use it until we left to go home.We will go to the Park again but we will likely stay just outside the western entrance and drive into the park each day.","September 14, 2014",Excellent Experience But For a Few Problems,74,"Incline Village, Nv",5

If your time is limited hike the Vernal Falls/Nevada Falls loop trail or Yosemite Falls trail.Another great half day trip is the shuttle from the valley floor to Glacier Point.There are all sorts of accommodations, from back country camping to four star lodging and dining at the Ahwanhee.

Yosemite Valley,"This was our second trip to Yosemite.This time we took our son, daughter in law and 17 year old grandaughter (who thought it was awesome!). Our first visit was scuppered by the pass being closed due to snow. This time choosing August enabled us to travel through the park and over the pass instead of having to turn back. On the way along Hwy41 we turned off to the Mariposa Grove. We seemed to spend hours wandering through the Giant Sequoias, an experience not to be missed. Further along Hwy41, as we crested the hill we were confronted with a view of The Half Dome, El Kapitan and Eagle Peak. To the right was Sentinel Falls which, due to the drought had hardly any water and was not falling but blowing upwards due to the updraught. Spectacular photographs all round. Camping, climbing and cycling is certainly an attraction here. We travelled down into the valley and, with various stops for more photos and some food, circumnavigated the valley route. Conscious of time and distances we continued out of the valley and onto Hwy120 and the Tioga Pass Rd stopping near May Lake which allows an uninterrupted view of the northern side of the North Dome which is perhaps even more impressive.The road reaches a height of about 11000 feet (2 miles) if I remember rightlyand the reduction in oxygen is noticeable, before dropping steeply down to Mono Lake and the Interstate 395. Although there were many warnings we never saw a bear or a cougar. Probably because they were fed up with seeing millions of tourists. I haven't posted any photos because Trip Advisor already has so many of excellent quality.","September 13, 2014",One of the most beautiful and awe inspiring places on earth.,56,"Wisbech, United Kingdom",5

There is a drought in California and the park does an excellent job of controlling water flow from faucets. Unfortunately there were 2 separate wild fires while we were there and we were unable to continue our hike to the Vernal falls. The park rangers did an excellent job evacuating people camping near the fires without alarming those of us who were camping in the valley. We were a little disappointed that some falls were dry and that Mirror Lake was completely without water. I assumed it was the drought, but found out later that the lake is ""seasonal"".

He talked about some of the areas on the way there. He knew Yosemite inside and out. He has been doing this since 1999 and is very enthusiastic about Yosemite. We got to see a lot in one day much more than if we were on our own. We also had a light breakfast and a very good lunch which was inside the park, sandwiches, salads and beer & pop.

We came in through the Tunnel View entrance just at sunset - it was exciting. The park Rangers and all the staff were some of the kindest people and always friendly and helpful. We took the moonlight tram tour when there was a Super Moon - it was BEAUTIFUL! Our tour guide Ranger was very informative and pleasant. We now wish we had taken the daytime tour too. The only problem we had was with parking (we arrived in the park just before time to get on the tour so we didn't understand we should park somewhere else and ride the shuttle). We saw a fox, several deer, and a lot of squirrels. We drove to Glacier Point to look over the park, and watch the helicopters work to put the fires out. We took the tram tour to see the Giant Sequoias. They are really something to see and shouldn't be missed. The road from Oakhurst area to the valley is a very winding road that takes over an hour. Driven at night takes some patience and somebody not too tired or sleepy to drive.

There are no campgrounds in the park that have rv hook ups. We drove the entire park from east to west on Tioga Road and also made the excursion down into the valley. The place was beautiful but terribly overrun with cars, tourists, tour buses. It was so bad I could smell exhaust smoke in the valley and had to circle parking lots just to try to find a parking spot; oftentimes we couldn't. California is in a draught so there was no water running at all over either bridal veil falls or either of the yosemite falls. If we ever return we will go in early spring or in the fall so we can see some water over the falls and avoid the overcrowding. I don't go to nature to be in crowds or traffic jams.

Yosemite Valley,"Please be aware that the core of Yosemite (the village etc) is basically a resort. It is packed with people who are holidaying with family/kids and does not come across as a nature reserve. Having spent 3 days there really I can't describe it as a nature reserve, particularly having seen places like Muir Woods. It is founded on this holiday atmosphere, and it is only when you go to some efforts to find undiscovered areas that you begin to feel like you are in natural woodland and wilderness. If your vibe is to relax and take shuttles etc. around some nice lanes then for sure this is the place for you. However if you're seeking a more genuine-feeling natural experience I wouldn't recommend, unless you're down to really put some effort into separating from the mass population. If you're travelling via public transport it is also very restrictive, and proves to be expensive. The park itself is also expensive- they seem to charge a premium on all products. Bike rental, horse-riding, abseiling etc. is all extortionate, particularly if you're paying for yourself and your family. The staff were very friendly. However they were not totally interested in explaining where the best wild sections were when my friend and I repeatedly asked them. One gets the gist that it is all rehearsed and contrived. The trails were obviously very enjoyable but it took a day for us to even figure out the best ones, which were also packed with people. The one saving factor is the natural surroundings which the various false villages taint. ","September 4, 2014","Touristy resort, not natural",109,"Harrow, United Kingdom",3

Yosemite Valley,"Visited Yosemite for 2 1/2 days for the first time this August. Was there with my sons for a hiking trip so stayed in the tents in Curry village which were good but basic. In August pretty well all the fall have stopped running and the river is low ( which it makes it safe for swimming). Staying in Curry camp meant that we had quick access to all the main trails. First night we hired bikes and rode round the valley trails for a couple of hours. This was great fun and got us orientated for all the main sites. Can't keep bikes overnight and have to be returned by 7.45. We decided to do the Mist trail as the Vernal and Nevada falls had some water. Started early(about 8.00am) which meant it was quieter on the trail and for most of the steep climb we were in shade. Came back down the John Muir trail which is less steep but with some good views. The last section retraces the first part of the mist trail which was getting very busy and in full sun by around 12.30 / 1.00pm. Great walk which would be even better when the fall are in full spate.After spending some time relaxing on the river beach at Housekeeping camp we dove up to Glacier Point stopping at Tunnel View. The evening sun makes the views even more dramatic from Glacier point and we stayed on till after 9.00pm to see the night sky.Day 2 we headed out to Wawona where we caught the free bus out to the Redwoods at Mariposa grove. These were pretty impressive but very different from the coastal redwoods which are mostly taller but not as wide. There is a trailer tour which visits the main sites but we opted to walk round the trails and spent longer than we intended. some of the best groups of Redwoods are in the upper section. We then walked the 6 mile trail back to Wawona through the woods which was very quiet but with few views out. Food in Curry camp is pretty basic(no cooking in or around the tents) so we walked over to The Ahwahnee hotel for our evening meal. Food was OK but the hotel and dining room are worth seeing and make a great place to site quietly away from the bustle of Curry camp.Loved Yosemite even in busy August.

It was a beautiful setting and lots of people were in and out of the water, but didn't really feel crowded. If you plan ahead a stay at the Ahwahnee is icing on the cake. I love the old inns.

As we didn't have enough time, we did the Full coach tour including Glacier point, Half Moon etc.. which was superb with Herb our guide. Well worth the expense. Housekeeping Camp won't be for everyone ... but if you are happy to camp, then it was great. We were a bit nervous of the bears and the precautions you have to take with food etc.. but it all helps with the adventure. We were assured that the bears only want food and not humans!!

No loud crowds, just a relaxing time.We did Vernal Falls and a bit of Panorama Trail, just down to Illuoette Falls and saw just a few people on the way.

First of all the approach road - very winding and we got sick of it traveling on it (we stayed outside the gate in a overpriced Tenaya lodge) and it is an hour drive from the gate to the valley.While the rocks are pretty (El Capitan is the best) the trails are a bit of disappointment. We did top of Nevada falls which is a round trip of 6+ miles (Misty trail + John Muir trail on return). The John Muir trail is full of dust and horse dung.Overall, it is a bit disappointment for me (my family loved it though) simply because the expectations were high, and the place is full of trees and the valley is relatively narrow.The experience might be better if you go in early summer/spring where there is water in the falls and if you stay inside the park (instead of driving through the winding roads).","August 27, 2014","Winding roads, dusty and full of trees",8,Northern Virginia,3
Yosemite Valley,"We only had 2 full days here, but could have used a whole week. Staying in Curry Village was a good experience, the tent cabins are surprisingly comfortable and everyone staying there was lovely.

Great time.","August 27, 2014",Wish we could have had more time.,28,"Katikati, New Zealand",5
Yosemite Valley,"On 8/22/14 my wife and I toured the park, with about 20 other people who signed up with San Francisco's Comprehensive Tours. We loved the sights, the weather was great and the park was basically empty. The challenge was that it was a long 14 hour tour (7:00 am to 10:15 pm was what the tour company says), from San Francisco to Yosemite and back in one day. San Francisco's Comprehensive Tours started off poorly by picking up our group about 15 minutes late with the first bus because the tour guide overslept. After the 1/2 hour bus ride we had about a 4 hour train ride and then another 2 hour bus ride to the park. This all went well, and we spent about 3 1/2 hours at the park. The return; bus and train ride to Emeryville, CA went well, but of course we arrived tired as it was getting late, about 9:30 pm. We waited at the train station for the last shuttle bus to pick us up and return us to our various hotels in San Francisco. We were not exactly sure where it was going to pick our group up, but after being about 20 minutes late it arrived. The Driver said he was tired as he had gotten up at 6:00 that morning (I was sure everyone else on the bus had gotten up even earlier to make the 6:45 am pick-up) and this was his forth transfer for the day. The big problem begin when we got to San Francisco; the Driver ask everyone where they were staying so he could drop them off at their various hotels. Even with GPS he could not find one of the hotels, we drove around in circles for about an hour before people started to ask him to just stop the bus so they could get off and walk to their hotels. About 4 of us stayed on as we thought he might know where he was going and we didn't want to try and find our hotel in the dark, late at night, in a big city. But after another 1/2 hour of driving around we finally had him stop and we got off. We ended up walking a mile and a half, at 11:30 at night, to hour hotel. I had a different tour with this company the day before and all went well, but after this I strongly recommend not using SAN FRANCISCO'S COMPREHENSIVE TOURS, LLC.","August 27, 2014","Yosemite Valley with San Francisco's Comprehensive tours, LLC",2,"Paw Paw, Michigan",4
Yosemite Valley,"We had a great time . We got to the white wolf campground at about 7am on a monday morning .and were able to pick from about 3 camp sites which people had already left. If you get there early you can get a site pretty easy.after we set up our pop up camper we went to the small cabin to get the scoop. We found out that a forest fire had started two day before we got there, and now we would have to take a four hour detour around the park to get to the valley floor. To make a long story short we took the detour and hiked half dome the road opened up so we didn't have to take the detour back.It was very interesting to see a forest fire and how they fight it. There was smoke all thru the valley,it didn't bother us except our photos were always hazy.This is a must see for everyone I would highly recommend it.The views are incredible!! I would also recommend at least four days to see most of the sites as you take alot of time driving the winding roads.","August 27, 2014",Amazing,51,"Solon, Iowa",5

Yosemite Valley,"We travel extensively throughout the world and live in Southern California. Yosemite Valley is one of the great places and we come here every year. Make sure you stay in the Valley and not somewhere which claims to be nearby, but is at least 45 minutes away. There is camping, tent cabins where we are staying this time, Yosemite Lodge and the great Ahwanee Hotel.Reservations are difficult to get, but worth it. Can reserve one year and one day ahead of time. The open trolley ride on the valley floor is a good orientation. Last year we stayed for two weeks and brought our bicycles. This year it is only four nights, but we brought the bikes again. You can also rent bicycles here.Even if you don't stay at the Ahwanee, you can have dinner in the dining room which we just did this evening. It was great. You need to have long pants and a shirt with a collar.

The water is freezing cold as the snow melts and comes down stream. We walked along this area and the boys even walked in the water. They said it was like needles. It's so worth the experience and the photo ops here in every direction. Take your time and a sack lunch and remember take out only what you take in. Gods amazing beauty. It's an easy walk.

Despite the numbers of people that fill the valley every day, you can still be alone and soak up its serene ambience. Forest fires nearby shrouded the valley in a haze and can be seen drifting past you as you gaze at the peaks that stand bluntly in front of you. Children frolicked at Swinging Bridge and its river.

The simplest bike ride is to follow the Valley shuttle route and you can ride to the more popular views.

Overall if you only have a single day and want to get the flavor of the park this is a great way to do it, but if you want the chance for some real hiking and siteseeing off the main road you are better off staying overnight at least. If you go on this tour - our guide Leo said that the last stop in Mariposa had a great selection of souvenirs (the same or better than in Yosemite Village) - this was just not the case at all.

Most of my experiences with these natural wonders has been in the Appalachian mountain range. From the giant redwoods at the southern end of the park to the valley itself Yosemite will inspire and humble you with its power and beauty. We plan to visit some of the other parks in the west, but if we do not I will always be grateful for the time we spent in Yosemite. Just a note of caution: when hiking in Yosemite be aware that the trails are rugged and can be isolated. Factor in how long it will take you to hike back out and when you will run out of daylight. There are no street lights on the trails but you might get lucky and have a full moon.","August 17, 2014",Spectacular!,34,"Elkridge, Maryland",5

Yosemite Valley,"I can't say enough about how beautiful the Yosemite Valley is. Pictures do not do it justice. There is breathtaking scenery everyplace you turn. It makes you feel very humble as you take all of it in - Just amazing! You could easily spend days walking, hiking and enjoying it. Now for some logistics – prepare and plan for your visit! Getting to the Valley is not like driving on a freeway, the roads there are single lane and windy, going up and down. The max speed is probably 40 mph to get there. We stayed in Wawona area, and it took us about an hour to drive to the valley. The drive is beautiful, enjoy it, but plan for it and don’t be in a hurry. There are turnouts to let faster cars go by, USE them! Parking in the Valley can be tough, again plan accordingly – arrive early or later in the day. The signs are well marked for the different sites and views. Once you get there, be prepared to walk. This is a great place to walk and hike, bring snacks and drinks and good walking/hiking shoes. There is food in the Valley, but it can be expensive and gets crowded. Use the free shuttle system as much as you can if you don’t want to walk. There are lots of schedules, and the buses run regularly. Also check in at the Visitor’s Center, they can answer any questions and give a lot of great information. If you want to see the falls, I would suggest coming in the spring or early summer. We visited late July/early August and with the drought, the falls were all but dried up; still amazing views and hikes.

We must try to keep it safe for future generations. Beautiful rock formations. Olmsted point is a must stop. One can hike about, climb over rocks and just plain overwhelmed by the greatness of it all. Many lookout points so drive slowly when the views are particularly nice. Came down from Lake Tahoe on our way back to LA. We were driving E to W and most of the lookouts were on the opposite side of road. Can be kinda hairy and kept us off lot of lookouts. If possible I think I would do a W to E drive next time. On south drive it is one way so it was very easy to stop and admire the grandeur of El Capitan. Eat before or bring food as there does not seem to be much option within the park. Saw one gas station but thankfully we were driving econo car. The village itself was a mess.

Maybe I should have expected this, but not all drivers know how to use a damn TURNOUT. A Turnout is a part of a road that has been widened to allow faster cars to pass by.Really, a lot of cars drive 25mph on a 45mph single lane road. Time wasted that should have been spent hiking the beautiful scenery.Some trucks know how to use turnouts to let smaller cars pass by, some don't.Irritating RVs think they are the king of the road, driving ever so slowly, creating a 20 car, bumper to bumper traffic behind them, not giving a damn. They just don't care about other people behind them.Our toddler was already cranky and crying but there's not much I can do since the damn RV doesn't give space.

Even though we were there at a time of year when Yosemite is heaving, out on the cycle trails we often felt we had the place to ourselves. There are plenty of places to leave your bikes at the trailheads and you can readily stroll up the trails to see the waterfalls etc up close. Of course when you do this you encounter the hoards of motorists who are popping in and out of their cars all day.We spent the whole day out on the bikes and by the end of the day we felt we had seen the valley properly, up close and personal.You do not need to be fit to take this option......this is certainly the BEST way to experience the valley.","August 8, 2014",Go by bike,202,"London, United Kingdom",5

Or, if you are like us (we stayed in Mammoth and drove), get up early and beat the crowds driving in.A one day trip is not really enough time, but we still got to see a lot. We went to the Yosemite Valley and took a hike to Mirror Lake. It was a nice easy hike, and lots of beautiful trees, water and mountains.We had lunch at the snack shop and despite the fact that it was really crowded, it is still a beautiful and tranquil place to enjoy.The US District Court was an unusual find. I had no idea they even had one there. It only has 4 parking spaces, so it must not be very busy.You could probably spend weeks there, and not see it all. But, if you have one day to spend, it is well worth it.","August 5, 2014","Beautiful trees, water, mountains and a US District Court.",94,"Corona, California",5
Yosemite Valley,"We drove from Moaning Caverns about 2 hours to the gate. You will think you have entered the park, but you'll have about another 45 minutes to reach the gate. You will see the effects of the rim fires, but don't get discouraged. $20 car entrance fee. We wanted to go on the valley tour and horse back riding, but didn't get to to the ride because my nephew did not have long pants. Supposedly to go horse back riding you will need long pants and closed shoes. Anyway, we did the valley tram tour which though they say is 2 hours, it's a little less than that. I got some good pictures. You will get some interesting tidbits about the history. We only saw deer, no bears. We did not see any climbers on El Capitan, but that may have been because there was a 40% chance of rain that did not happen. We also went to the village center to the Indian Museum.The earth is a wondrous place, so Yosemite has to be on your bucket list.","August 5, 2014",Yosemite 1 day trip,14,"Berkeley, California",5

Had to wait 20 minutes for the line, also construction going on near the gate. Beautiful huge domes everywhere, pretty water areas. The east end has so many places for campers and swimming holes. Scenic a little different than the west end, but overall what a perfectly beautiful place. If you do the whole park give yourself a good full day, also hop the bus throughout the park. There is a fee to enter, but if you are 62 or older get the senior pass which is good for life at all National Parks. Great deal.This is a must see for the whole family.

Yosemite Valley,First let us say that this is an amazingly scenic park! However having visited several of our beautiful National Parks we felt that this one is definitely in need of help! Way too overcrowded! We both drove & took the shuttles during our 4 day visit. Road jams are the norm and parking lots were full. Shuttles were always full with standing room only. Eating facilities were always jam packed and service was slow. The whole park seemed understaffed. Hardly saw any Rangers. The rest rooms were so neglected and in need of updating and more frequent cleaning. The trails are beautiful but it was disheartening to see uneducated hikers taking advantage of the fragile environment. It was so sad to see such a beautiful area subjected to such abuse. John Muir must be turning in his grave! We hope the state of California and the National Park system wake up to this park's needs before it's too late!,"July 31, 2014",Beautiful But Being Loved To Death,117,"Tarpon Springs, Florida",3
Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite NP has to be one of the most beautiful places on Earth and the first sights of those two great granite monoliths, El Capitan and Half Dome, will live with us for ever. We aimed to spend just one day in Yosemite as part of a five day Californian road trip. In the context of the trip as a whole that proved fine but it isn't the best way to view Yosemite. You will need longer, there is just so much to see and when we visited, in the middle of July, it got very busy very early. Even by 11.00 in the morning finding a parking place near the Yosemite Village visitor centre required a degree of 'imagination' with so much space having already been taken by the ubiquitous R.V's (ridiculous vehicles?). Despite the crowds, actually travelling around isn't too bad and it's relatively easy to lose the madding crowd, at least it was until a rain storm caused a major mud and boulder slide which in turn resulted in a three hour traffic jam! Couldn't be helped of course and the park staff performed superbly but the change in weather, a 40 degree drop while we were there, together with the number of delays caused by roadworks were two of the things that surprised us. Otherwise just genuinely awesome but our advice would be to utilise the excellent value provided by the week long $20 vehicle pass - if there is any better deal anywhere we have yet to find it - and visit for longer than we did.","July 31, 2014",Outstandingly beautiful but equally busy,223,"Ashbourne, United Kingdom",5

If it is your first time visiting the park make sure you add extra time for the drive in, our gps said we were about 45 minutes from the valley floor after entering the park but we never arrived until about 2 hours later because we were constantly pulling off at the overlooks. Each overlook is more spectacular than the one before, and I cannot emphasize enough not to rush to the valley floor you will regret it!Yosemite is an amazing park even if you're not a hardcore rock climber there is so much to see and do there.","July 30, 2014",Jaw Dropping Beauty,5,,5

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite is one of the most beautiful places on the plant. We stayed outside of the park, if you can get lodging inside is much better because it's quite a drive into the park each day. The mountain roads are well maintained but can be quite hair raising at times with no rails along the roadway. It was rather sad to see how burned the pine forests on the west side were. They did explain that fires are good for the park but I'm sure that this much devistation is not what they mean. The seqoias were really cool. The eastside of the park is much more rocky and very green very little in burns. Probably less visited then the Valley area. There is a tram that will take you around the Mariposa seqoias, this worked out well for us. Very beautiful park, will go back again.","July 29, 2014",Yosemite west to east,14,"Fernandina Beach, Florida",5

We have been every season and it is always spectacular. We have driven all the way thru the park over the Tioga road, and the scenery is just as beautiful as visiting the valley. In the springtime, the falls are usually the most spectacular, as you are getting the snow runoff. The wintertime is quiet, but no less beautiful. I think the most breathtaking view is when you go thru the Wawona tunnel and see the whole valley. Many times you see wildlife, but I always respect that they are wild and keep my distance. Yosemite attracts people from all over the world, so you hear many languages. No matter how many times I have been there, there is always something new to see. Yosemite is one of my favorite places to visit anytime of the year. If you don't want the crowds, then fall and winter is your best bet.

We entered Yosemite through the southern gate and our first glimpse of the area was breathtaking. Luckily, they provide many areas to pull off the road and take pictures. We did not use the shuttle service, but had no problem finding parking throughout the valley. Be advised that the valley road becomes one way in and out, so be prepared for summer traffic jams. Be sure to wear or bring bathing suits, towels and bottled water with you. There are many places (some are sandy beaches) to get into the clear, mountain water. This was a favorite activity for our 9 & 12 year old kids after hiking the area and because of the drought, the water is shallow, so younger children are safe. We exited the valley through the northern gate and were sad o leave this wonderful spot. ","July 24, 2014",Photo Ops Everywhere,33,"South Riding, Virginia",5
Yosemite Valley,"Stunning views and amazing vistas. Very disappointed at the volume of people and cars more like the M25 at rush hour. As were visiting in June when I understand the US schools are on holiday (we had no choice over the time we visited) if I had known how busy the middle of nowhere was going to be before I arrived, I may have reconsidered. However all was not lost a trip to Mariposa Grove (giant sequoias), a road less travelled made up for all the Hustle and bustle of Yosemite Valley. In the end worth the trip despite the volume of people and cars.Some tips: if you are planning to visit a number US national parks consider purchasing the America the Beautiful Pass, its $80 (June 2014) as we were visiting a number of sites in California, Nevada and Arizona so it made sense for us to purchase this as opposed to individual park fees. You can buy online or from any NP office or NP entrance booths.If you don't mind the drive consider staying in Mammoth Lakes, much quieter (120 miles from Yosemite Valley) and drive into Yosemite. The drive along HWY 120 Tioga Road (subject to winter closure) is truly breath-taking and Mono Lake is out of this world. We did try to get lodging at the Ahwahnee, six months in advance and was unsuccessful and to honest I am glad after visiting we were not staying in the Valley..","July 24, 2014",Great views too much traffic,58,"Warrington, United Kingdom",4

Yosemite Valley,"We were a little apprehensive before arriving at Yosemite after hearing some horror stories about the relentless crowds in the valley. It's partially true. The valley is chock full of people but for a reason, because the views are amazing. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Yosemite and managed to make it as much of a wilderness experience as possible by doing a few things. Stay in the valley, then you should never have to drive and battle for a parking spot, use the convenient shuttle buses or better yet walk! Most people stop at the first viewpoint at a certain area and then just turn around. By making the extra effort to hike a little further you can often find near solitude just a short walk from a crowded viewpoint or parking lot. Finally, relax. Don't let the crowds spoil your vacation or your ability to enjoy this marvelous park.

Following morning, waded in Merced River, stopped at Bridal Veil falls, drove to Glacier Peak and on our way by 11:30 a.m.. All spectacular! One tip, check what time of day are best to see Bridal Veil and Yosemite falls. Depending on time, the fall may be in shade.

The park is very well maintained, the signs are clearly marked, the rangers are ever so helpful if you need direction. We were too late for the tram car ride that takes you up to see the grove of the Giant Sequoia. So we chose to walk up as it takes just 1/2 an hour of gentle walk to see the Largest Tree.

My dear friend and I took a shuttle up to the top of Glacier Point (don't look down!) where we had a sack lunch and then began our 4+ mile hike downhill into the valley. I thought walking downhill would be easy- NOPE! It used a whole new set of muscles I never knew existed. When we reached the end of the trail we took a shuttle back to our camp. Our cabins were pretty cool although close enough to other cabins to hear our neighbors snore! It added to the camping experience. The staff was very diligent in making sure we were protected from bears- bear boxes were outside each cabin and our trashcans were emptied daily. The staff was very helpful and friendly and seemed as pleased to be here as we were. You have got to put a visit to Yosemite National Park on your bucket list.

The drive to the Valley floor alone is very beautiful and breathtaking. Once you get there you will find several free trams that drop you off in various locations of the park. We went on a two mile hike total from the tram to the bridge of Vernal falls was 1 mile up and back. It was up hill a lot and very hard to do, but if you're use to it no problem. We went with children ages 9, 12 and 13 and 4 adults. It was well worth the uphill battle. There is a beautiful creek right when you first start. We came down after our hike and rested on the rocks and dipped our feet in the creek for about 30 minutes.

The valley feels like a busy city with too many hikers, bikers, and cars. The cars! Everywhere you look there is a parking lot. We had a terrible time in Curry Village which had tent cabins tightly packed together. It also didn't help that our tent cabin was only steps away from a very busy, loud bathroom.If you want to visit the park I highly recommend staying in a different area. If you are expecting the National Park experience you get in other places, you will be disappointed! The natural wonders are, as always, wonderful... but the overdevelopment really kills it.

Lots to see and learn here. Park rangers and guides available throughout the area to help you plan your day depending on your interests! The Valley in itself is beautiful, but the hikes and scenic drives will get you to the true beauty.

The shuttle buses make it easy to get around, but once you work out where everything is situated, it's better to park in the 'day use car park' & walk to the central village attractions. Places like Mirror lake at Shuttle stop 17, do need you to take the bus. One morning we went out on a photo walk with a lovely ranger called Julia. We didn't go more than 500m from the Visitor Centre, but by taking a boardwalk across a meadow, we lost the crowds of people. At Sentinel Bridge see Half Dome reflected in the river.

Yosemite Valley,"We have stayed in Yosemite many times - most often in the valley floor area. This is the most popular area of the park for those who are not going to the back county. It is where the base of 3 falls are; it is where much of the park lodging is (Ahwahnee, Camp Curry, the Lodge). It is where the limited number of restaurants are.Its a place where we have seen bears. We have sat outside late at night and heard the howl of raccoons climbing the trees above us. We have done many walks from here with our most popular valley walks being 1) Walking from Camp Curry to Ahwahnee Hotel for brunch and back; 2) Do the entire Valley Walk (Not by tram but by hiking path); and also 3) walk from Camp Curry parking lot to happy isles.We have rafted the river. we have had good dinners at the Ahwahnee Dining Room.What I do not like is the crowd of people, the parking situation, the overly touristy hype of the valley.....but for those going for the first time its the place to stay.For seeing the true Sierras for return trips go to other locations oft the Sierras and marvel at the amazing areas outside the valley floor area. Thus the very good but not excellent rating.","July 10, 2014",For First Time Visitors - the Heart of Yosemite National Park,3452,"Fremont, California",4

Yosemite Valley,"I have to provide feedback about our trip to Yosemite because I plan all of my trips through tripadvisor based on the reviews & advice from others. Lodging: We stayed at a house in Foresta for the same cost that it would have been to spend in the Ahwahnee Hotel. Excellent choice for our family given the ability to spread out & it's location within the park.Trails: We chose trails that we knew we could do with regards to the older children's stamina/abilities & the baby either being in a backpack or stroller. *My favorite was Sentinel Dome because of the panoramic views. A lot of uphill, but we just stopped & took breaks along the way. No stroller use here. Baby must go in a backpack. Views were really spectacular & we saw maybe 7-8 people total here.*Glacier point: a must see, stroller-friendly, don't have to go far at all for the beautiful views.*Bridalveil falls: stroller-friendly. Nice, short hike with a pretty view of the falls at the end.*Yosemite falls: baby in a backpack on this one. We were able to hike so far & then my husband took the older kids closer to the base of the falls. For them (going closer to the base of the falls), there was lots of rock scrambling, perfect for their age, but would have been unpassable in my opinion with a baby. A little divide & conquer, but it worked out perfectly so everyone was happy & safe.*Vernal falls footbridge. Baby in a backpack for this one. Not my favorite, but everyone might have been hiked out at that point. It was more strenuous then I thought it would be so that may have been part of the problem.Food: *Stopped for food at a grocery store before entering the park (for breakfests & picnic lunches) *Food court: food was what you would expect from a food court. Not my favorite meal.*Ahwahnee Hotel bar: one of the best meals we had on our vacation. I got the chicken salad sandwich & it was delicious, just what I wanted. We got to sit outside & there was a grassy field right next to our table so the kids got their football & were tossing that around while we waited for dinner. A deer came (apparently known to come everyday) & gave us something entertaining to watch. So casual & the views were beautiful!!*Ahwahnee dining room: packed the collared shirts & pants for the guys & dresses for us girls. Worth it. You felt like you were transported to another era eating in that beautiful room, that was very family/child-friendly. Piano player was really good, played recognizable songs & the waiters were very kind & accommodating. Food was good. Everyone found something.*Curry village: ate the best mint chocolate chip ice-cream I've ever had at curry village. Stopped there for dessert one night. My husband said it was probably just Edy's or something, but whatever...just had to mention it in case someone is a fan of the flavor like me!*iron door saloon in groveland on the way out for lunch. Perfect. family friendly & loud so no problems with squabbling kiddos. typical bar food, good sandwiches & fries.Medical:*had to make a stop at the Yosemite valley medical center/clinic for the baby who we thought might have an ear infection. The doctors & nurses were very kind & the place was clean. They do stock some meds in case they are needed (antibiotics & the like).Misc:*we didn't find the bugs to be a problem at all. Packed bug spray just in case, but it wasn't an issue for us.*If you're afraid of heights, the drive into the park from San Fran via 120, well, wow...I was scared a couple of times, lots of twists & turns & steep drop-offs. I just took it slow & was fine. Easier on the way out, when you're in the lane hugging the mountain side :)*It was a great time in Yosemite with the family.

Great to do an early hike, grab some food, and hit the beach for some early morning sun before it gets too hot, plus a refreshing dip in the river. I was so happy riding my bike around here and feeling free. My early mornings showed me a bear cub, had me approached by a herd of deer stags, and offered incredible views of a glowing half dome.

I highly recommend early and often for the most popular spots. Our highlights: 1) Mist Trail early one morning - Mist Trail up, John Muir Down2) Panorama Trail (Book 8:30 bus to Glacier Point and hike down) even though you cover the Mist again on this hike it will be busy in the afternoon so you can dwell at Nevada Falls where there is room and not worry about getting the best view spots for the middle and lower fall positions3) Tuolumne Meadows for a day. Hiking around or atop Lambert Dome. Catch a stretch of the Pacific Crest Trail and the John Muir Trail.4) Mariposa Grove hike for the giant Sequoias. We spent three days in the park and could have spent another two. Yosemite falls and Bridalveil falls can be picked up as you are moving though the valley. Also catch a post-hike cocktail at the lodge. It is beautiful and has great views from the bar tables overlooking the lawn.","July 8, 2014",Unblieveable Experience,72,"Chicago, Illinois",5

Yosemite Valley,"The Park was established in 1890 and is llocated in central California. The park draws over 3.5 million visitors a year and 95% of the park’s 747,956 acres, is roughly the size of Rhode Island and classified as wilderness. The park is home to “Giant Sequoia trees,” which are estimated to be over 3,000 years old.Nearly 3,000 years ago the “Paiute & Sierra Miwok” were the first people residing in the Yosemite Valley. The mid-19th century “Gold rush “increased the white population into the area. 1851 saw the war known as the “Mariposa Wars” erupted between 200 Ahwahneechees and the US Army led by Major Jim Savage. By 1853, the remaining Ahwahneechee were absorbed into the Mono Lake Paiute tribe.The Valley is a 7 mile wide canyon with rock formations, including El Capitan, the world's tallest granite monolith and one of the world's top rock climbing destinations. Yosemite Falls is the largest waterfall in North America and peak visitation occurs during the spring as it is comprised entirely of melting snow. There are thirteen campgrounds and seven lodges and includes a range of activities from tours, dining in a historic hotels to spending the night camping out and gazing at the stars. Yosemite also has some 800 miles of trails to hikers.The Lyell Glacier is the largest glacier at Yosemite National Park and one of the few remaining in the Sierra Nevada today. There are three groves of ancient Giant Sequoia trees; the Mariposa Grove (200 trees), the Tuolumne Grove (25 trees), and the Merced Grove (20 trees). This species grows larger in volume than any other and is one of the tallest and longest-lived. Granite domes such as Sentinel Dome and Half Dome rise 3,000 and 4,800 feet, above the valley floor. Yosemite is also famous for its high concentration of waterfalls. The Yosemite Falls is the highest in North America at 2,425 feet. The lower volume Ribbon Falls has the highest single vertical drop, of 1,612 feet. The most prominent of the waterfalls is Bridal Veil Falls.Yosemite Valley is open year-round, but closed in late autumn due to snow and re-opens the following spring. Open-air tours on buses around Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias are available. Bicycle rentals are available with over 12 miles of paved bike paths are available in Yosemite Valley. Helmets are required by law for children under 18 years of age. Water activities are plentiful during warmer months. Rafting can be done through the Yosemite Valley on the Merced River. Our trip:Our last trip here was in May of this year. We arrived early before the majority of the crowd and driving into the Yosemite Valley, observed the iconic falls and the mountains. The falls were beautiful to see even from the roadway. Continuing our drive, I noticed cars stopped up ahead and people out in front or to the sides of their vehicles. As I approached, I saw a “black bear with her two cubs” on the right side of the roadway. People had stopped their vehicles, jumped out and started to take pictures without thinking about traffic approaching which stopped to avoid hitting the stopped vehicles. From inside of our vehicle, we saw a “man” with his camera walking towards the bear, which we thought was a “stupid idea.” The “mother bear” started to walk into the woods with her two cubs closely behind and this “knucklehead” following them until he disappeared from sight. “I explained to our kids the hazards of following wildlife into their natural habitat!” We never heard any word on whether the knucklehead we saw became supper for the bears. We parked our vehicle and walked to see both the lower and upper falls, taking in the views around us and enjoying the scenery. On our walk, we saw a couple of deer’s close by and watched as they were foraging for food and walked off into the woods. At the falls, it was inspiring to see from a bridge just below the lower falls. Once again there was a sign warning people not to go into areas closed off, they were there! I guess these are the ones we hear about on the “nightly news” hanging off the side of a cliff or tree they weren’t supposed to climb in the first place. We then drove to Curry Village and continued our walk and stopped in at the village grocery/souvenir store which is the only one in the park for a bite to eat and refreshments. We then drove over to “Bridal veil falls” and walked a short distance to admire the falls and look at more wildlife. We got a good look at “Half Dome” where millions of tourists have climbed her by walking up steps or by ropes. We took the long walk up several years ago and once we reached the top took in the valley, which was awesome! Before we left, we stopped into the Yosemite Museum which showcased the cultural history of the Miwok and Paiute Native American tribes who once inhabited Yosemite. In the rear of the museum is a reconstructed ""Indian Village of Ahwahnee."" You will enjoy your visit!","July 6, 2014","""A world all it's own!""",250,"Tracy, California",5
Yosemite Valley,"I will caveat this review by saying that we went to Yellowstone the year prior, so my expectations were very high. Yosemite was amazing, has beautiful geological formations, waterfalls, rivers, meadows and hiking. Unfortunately I prefer Yellowstone. There were several drawbacks to Yosemite that I just couldn't get over. The roads through the park make driving an unavoidable task. If I return, it will be with a camper so I can move, and camp, throughout the park and not spend so much time driving. I imagine it is a completely different experience hiking the park. There was also limited wildlife. I kept hearing about the bears in Yosemite, but didn't see one. It was a stark contrast to Yellowstone where we saw bears every day! Black, brown and Grizzly!! The lack of animal sightings was definitely disappointing. Please don'e get me wrong, the views are amazing, and the park is beautiful, but I am a wildlife buff and it just didn't scratch my itch. Even through I was a little disappointed in the areas mentioned above, we loved the trip and it is a must see American treasure.","July 6, 2014","A beautiful National Park, but the best?",38,"Denver, Colorado",4
Yosemite Valley,"Was expecting so much of this park after being wonder struck at Yellowstone, tetons, Bryce, Zion and Grand Canyon, etc and just did not happen. We visited the 4th July weekend and it was horrible....the park is just not set up for the volume of visitors and parking was a nightmare (non existent) and buses did not run to Glacier Valley.Mariposa Grove was outstanding (once crowds left behind after about 20 minutes hiking) and hike up to Nevada Falls was very challenging and beautiful. But I think we were spoiled with yellowstone......this park just does not compare in any way, shape or form. We expected so much and it delivered so little: yes there are some stunning views but there is just not the variety (or space) at other wonderful national Parks.We have another 2 days here but will not be visiting Yosemite again during this time - getting around is just too darn difficult and waiting 2 hours to get out of the park (after giving up trying to find anywhere in the park to park) just doesn't do it!","July 5, 2014",Vastly overrated,18,salisbury,2
Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley was well organized with plenty of family events, albeit for mostly young children. The shuttle service was prompt, free, and EASY. I loved the fact that once you parked, you didn't start your car until you left a few days later. It was that simple. Food was OK (eat at the dining center at the Wawona Hotel), but the views and hikes made up for it. A must see.","July 5, 2014",Mini Switzerland,10,"Baltimore, Maryland",5
Yosemite Valley,"I first visited Yosemite National Park over sixty years ago with my maternal grandparents. It was an exciting place for a child under ten. With my grandfather's help, I learned to ride a two-wheel bike when i was five at Yosemite. The waterfalls were wonderful and, in those days, there was also a ""fire fall"" from Glacier Point, an attraction which fortunately has been terminated as poor for the environment. So, I was really looking forward to seeing Yosemite after sixty years and introducing it to my wife. Yosemite is really good, but it is far from perfect. The natural beauty is still there with sheer cliffs that were carved by glaciers down which waterfalls descend. Those readers who have been to the South Island of New Zealand will have seen similarly steep, glacially carved walls of valleys together with waterfalls there. We visited from July 1-4, a high season. The Park is so full of tourists from many, many places overseas as well as from many places in the United States. The tourists are overwhelmingly very civil, but it is a bit like Grand Central Station. We stayed in Curry Village in a ""tent cabin"". This was not cheap at over $125 per night. The restaurant facilities there were reasonably cheap and the fare not bad considering its reasonable cost. However, if one's neighbours were a bit noisy, one could hear all in the next tent cabin. The wifi system was also oversubscribed and one could get onto the internet only after a considerable wait. The National Park has an extensive free bus shuttle system for places reasonably near the centre locations, but if one wants to use the shuttles to visit the wonderful Bridal Veil Falls (which change continuously as the wind blows), a good two plus mile hike is required (close to 5 miles, 8 km return). The sign posting in the Park is also poor. We took the Loop trail, but had to ask a ranger for some detail to find our way from the Shuttle to Bridal Veil Falls. The only marking on the Loop trail appears to have been a picture of a carabiner. I asked a senior ranger if this was the marking for the Loop trail, but he did not know. If a senior ranger doesn't know, how about the poor visitor? The trails too went primarily through pine forest. This is nice, but forests in many other places are much more interesting. I would recommend a visit, but it would be better to be in the spring (well before the high summer holidays) when the waterfalls will have more water or else in the autumn after summer and before Thanksgiving.","July 4, 2014",Can you go back again?,137,"Melbourne, Australia",4

Yosemite Valley,"We spent three days exploring Yosemite National Park and didn't see even half of it. the Valley area is quite congested with cars and people. You need to take the free shuttles to get around - they are well worth it. The village store caters to campers - it's mostly food and some souvenirs. I liked the restored Indian village but wish they had some interpreters to share more information. the Indian museum at the end of the village is a small gem - very nice baskets and artifacts. Because of the drought, much of the natural wonders - Bridal Falls, Mirror Lake, etc. are not as spectacular as in other years, but they are still worth seeing. WE also hike one of the trails - Taft and Sentinel Dome. Quite an experience! couldn't believe the people we saw wandering around in flip flops and not carrying any water. People should be more prepared - this is wildnerness! The Mariposa Grove with the giant sequoias was lovely and not overly crowded.

Yosemite Valley,"Our family goes to a different national park each summer. Last summer, we enjoyed Yellowstone. This summer, it was Yosemite. Unfortunately, I think we were spoiled by the sheer multitude of things to do and see in Yellowstone, and the variety of natural wonders. We couldn't help but compare the two experiences. Whereas we saw an incredible amount of wildlife in Yellowstone - grizzly bears, black bears, coyotes, antelope, mountain goats, deer, elk, bison, bald eagles - we really only saw deer in Yosemite. Coming from Colorado, we felt like our own backyard offered more. Whereas there was something awe-inspiring every stop along the way in Yellowstone, we had to drive for long periods of time to see attractions in Yosemite. That being said, it is still a beautiful area. Waterfalls and valleys and wonderful weather. We went hiking up to Dog Lake, which was a favorite activity and a spot where we were able to get some privacy for quite awhile. We rented a raft and spent a relaxing afternoon enjoying our packed picnic at a leisurely pace floating along the river. And we drove the Giant Sequoias, which was another favorite. THIS is where we felt we were experiencing something we can't find elsewhere. Amazing trees.Overall, an enjoyable vacation, but we learned some valuable lessons. This park would've been ideal with a camper or RV. Unless you're one of the lucky who can get a room at one of the park lodges far in advance and at considerable cost, this is your best option. Otherwise, you will spend a good chunk of time at the beginning and end of your day simply driving from the entrance to what you want to do that day.","July 2, 2014",We were spoiled by Yellowstone...,19,"Castle Rock, Colorado",3

Yosemite Valley,"Too much to put in one review, I'll focus on where to spend the night--the hiking is amazing, however--something for everyone. Read the brochures they hand you at the entrance and study up on how far or hard you can hike before starting. Allow 6-8 hours to get to and enjoy the top of Half Dome. Okay, as far as sleeping goes, we stayed in the tent cabins at Curry Village. Pricing is in the middle of all the options. We stayed four nights. By the third day, I couldn't hike or do anything much, due to lack of sleep and exhaustion. I wore earplugs--a must--but because the tents are so close together, you hear a lot of noise--ALL NIGHT! The first night it was 1:30am when the laborious voice of a neighbor finally ceased. Then, at 5:00am, the heavy footsteps of hikers rushing out to start Half Dome woke me up. The second night was worse! it was finally quiet about 2:00am, but at 4:30am, loud hikers headed out with flashlights on their heads that shone into our tent--TIP: Do not get a tent on a path corner, or by the trash or by the bathrooms (unless you can sleep through anything). During the days, we hiked to the top of Vernal falls, road bikes, swam in the lovely pool open to all Curry Village guests. You can use the pool or showers for a small fee if you are not staying in Curry Village, so the showers there are very busy at 5:00pm--the woman's had a line about 8-10 people long. We had children with us, age 6 and 7, so we found ourselves in the pool every afternoon after our adventures. The showers here are a little nicer than the ones in the bathrooms, so we tried to exit the pool about 4:45pm, shower and head to dinner. The food in the cafeteria is over priced and not very good. The pizza is okay and reasonable. We took the shuttle to The Mountain Room at Yosemite Lodge, it was better than the cafeteria--spendy, but at least much better than the cafeteria. Be warned, however, that the shuttle stops at 10:00pm. So get to dinner early. We also ate at the Ahwahnee--worth the cost, if not for the food, for the experience. I recommend the brunch. We biked there, it was a lovely trip. The bike rentals are right at the Curry Village entrance. We rented tandems so the young ones could keep up. We biked along the wonderful paths and stopped at a swimming hole to splash around and cool off. The views are amazing from just about anywhere in the Valley. We drove to the Sequoias and saw Grizzly Giant, the largest tree in the park. We ate dinner at the Wawona Hotel. It was nice. a lot better than anything in Curry Village. TIP: It's a long drive from The Village/Yosemite Valley. So if you're coming from LA/the south, hit it on the way in or out. It was an hour drive from Curry Village. Traffic was heavy, the roads are curvy and although the sign said 35 miles, it took us an hour to drive there, less to get back (about 45 mins). Stop outside the tunnel and take a Selfie in front of El Capitan and Half Dome! Its one of the only places in the park where you can fit yourself and both spectacles in one photo.

Yosemite Valley,"First let me say that if you are interested in giant Redwood tree, go to Sequoia/Kings Canyon National park (they adjacent to each other.If youre gonna to mainly car viewing...Glacier Point is a MUST SEE spot. Yes it is a litte out of the way but WELL worth the drive. You drive there or bus it but you will see Yosemite Valley with all the major landmarks from a bird's eye view. Take binoculars and you WILL see hikers on top of Half Dome as well as climbers (from Valley Floor) going up El Capitan. Food is not an issue...too many places to eat. If youre a regular hiker, consider going up the Mist Trail, and then turn right where indicated to head towards Glacier P:oint and then down the Four Mile Trail..take two canteen, lunch/snacks and water filter. IF you have time, go up Yosemite Falls....however, once youre on top where the creek is, cross it and go to the higher level....its a short distance...DO NOT go swimming in the creek....people do go over the falls and perish...not worth it...It is a long drive no mater where you start from. If at all p;ossible get there the day before so that you can get used to the altitude and youll be rested in the morning. Parking is dicey but manageable. Bridalveil Fall is also one to check out...keep an eye on the kids when near river and creeks......its slippery and not forgiving.....take suntan lotion and mosquito repellent AND A CAMERA ...and most importantly .....wear appropriate shoes....no flip flops, no street shoes (slippery)..The visitor center is very nice as well as the Ansel Adams shop there. If youre brave and plan to hike to the top of Half Dome....check out the permit regulations first.....that hike is grueling and an ALL DAY hike...ive seen p;eop;le get back after dark...avoid that by planning better....I live in the area and ive gone numerous times to Yosemite Falls, Clouds Rest, Half Dome, Tuolumne Meadow on back packing trips...im sure others have gone a lot more......it is very iconic park. ...i cant stress enough the need to respect the water/creeks, rivers etc etc....be safe.I certainly did not cover everything but i wanted to give a basic idea on what to expect for new visitiors.

Yosemite Valley,We were coming back through the last leg of our wild west tour and instead of going back over the historical Donna Pass we cut through Yosemite National park and it became the best move of our life. It was late April and the snow was still high up on the banks the lakes were crystal ice on the edges and a deep haunting blue Green. The scenery was breath taking and it seemed that around every corner it got visually better and better wildlife you could reach out and touch. We stayed at the best western the other side of Yosemite look out for my review on that.

For your average visitor, not going on long hikes, just wanting to see the bulk of the park is the valley. Start early and beat the crowds and you can see so much more quicker. Hit it again after four in the afternoon and crowds were much lighter. A photographers dream, not many bad pictures around this place. My favorite was the tunnel view at sunset, half-dome and El Capitan were almost pinkish purple, hard to describe how beautiful.

Yosemite Valley,"We drove the Tioga Pass from the East Entrance of Yosemite National Park last week. The Pass is exceptional (and about 10 degrees cooler than the rest of the park)! You start off climbing to the Tuolumne Meadows (meadows and lakes) which reminds me of the rim trail at the Tahoe Basin. A small visitor station is staffed with rangers who can assist on hikes in the area, or prepare you for the Valley (since the Valley is considerably more crowded). There are not a lot of services in this section of the park so prepare yourself with food and/or drink, or wait in line at the one food service area. Lots of pull-off areas for viewing, access to the lakes, and hiking trails. Beware if you are afraid of heights or confined driving spaces as part of the Pass has no rail between you and the edge of a cliff, and the road is one lane each way leaving you at the mercy of the drivers in front of you, and their courteous driving (or lack thereof). At the end of the Tioga Pass, we continued to the Valley section of the park which was a bit of a disappointment at first as it is considerably hotter, and less pleasing to the eye to start. The Valley section was a little like being at the mall parking lot on a weekend - CROWDED! But again, its June! We stayed one night in a wood cabin at Curry Village. The cabin was adequate for a National Park but the shared showers were on the dirty side (and we frequent many National Parks but these hotel area are outsourced). Bring shower shoes, a flashlight, and save yourself from the garbage smells of the provided shampoo in the shared showers). Pizza at Curry Village was good, although service is slow as only one cashier in the summer. I cannot recommend the Curry Village restaurant for dinner as the food looked less than edible and we ended up with the salad bar z(they no longer do a buffet here). But now for the REALLY GOOD parts: the Mist Trail to the Vernal Falls - about a mile uphill on a paved path so go early or late in the day and save yourself from some of the heat. We saw a black bear who was scratching his backside on a downed tree (AWESOME!); the Yosemite Falls (lower) - easy, short trails to the impressive falls but the real fun is going to the right hand side at the fall and climbing the granite rocks. These rocks are slippery, even when dry, so plan your foot wear accordingly. Mist from falls kept us cooled off, and places to put your feet in the water without risking life and limb; Mirror Lake - a great early morning hike that is about a mile. Two options - right hand side is dirt trail, and left hand side is paved road. Go to the sign with information for the Dam and this is the perfect, calm spot for playing in the sand, climbing the big granite boulder, getting your legs in the water and relaxing. Recommend the Junior Ranger program for anyone with children. The badge is wood which is unique compared to most National Parks in the US which issue plastic badges. And for those looking for a wetter adventure, they offer rafting rides at the Recreation Center at Curry Village, or bring your own inflatable and enjoy the VERY COLD water.","June 18, 2014",Beautiful Drive on Tioga Pass to Yosemite Valley!,35,"Myersville, Maryland",4

Make reservations early because everything fills quickly - the prices inside the park tend to be high but you'll save a lot of time driving in compared to staying outside the park so it can balance out. However, keep in mind that the campgrounds are elbow-to-elbow and jam-packed during the summer months so if you want a little more privacy, you'll need to backpack, use a walk-in camp or stay in another location. in the valley itself, there are shuttles to take you from location to location so don't worry if you have to park far from where you intend to spend time - the shuttles are free and run several times an hour so it's a convenient way to travel around the area.

The price for park entrance is $20.00 for 7 days. The must see's are upper Yosemite Falls and Tuolumne Meadows. If you don't have reservations the best suggestion I have is to go and if you are able to get there mid-week start at Tuolumne Meadows camps where over 50% of the sites are held on a first come, first come basis.

Loved avoiding the hassle of our car and letting someone else drive. It was not that crowded but if it gets like some say, leave the car behind! Water falls were full force first weekend in June as per Ranger. Just fyi, we were told there are between 15-21 bears at any given time in the valley. One rangers job is to track them all the time.

Yosemite Valley,"We visited Yosemite several times in the Spring, Summer, and Fall. The best time to visit is late Spring when the waterfalls are running full and the crowd is still thin and the temperature is comfortable. The condition changes based on mother-nature’s will. The past winter was dry, the Yosemite Falls have much less water than past Springs. It was also hot in the 90sF first week of June. Summer is hot in the 90sF and very crowded with children out of school. Fall is nice and cool, but the Yosemite Falls are dry, no water. Winter is cold and covered with snow and ice. The road to Glacier Point is closed due to snow and ice in the winter.The free shuttle that runs through the valley is very efficient. We park the car at a lot and ride the shuttle to all view points. In the summer, there is also free shuttle to El Capitan that runs every half hour. We ride this bus on the loop to see the park.Yosemite FallsYou can see Yosemite Falls (both Upper and Lower) from the Yosemite Lodge parking lot. It’s an easy ½ mile walk from the parking lot to the base of the lower falls on paved road. This is the most popular attraction and crowds are big, but it’s worth it. Wear your bathing suit so that you can wade in the water on a hot day.Vernal FallsTake the free shuttle to Happy Isle for the trail head to Vernal Falls and Nevada Falls. The hike to Vernal Falls Foot Bridge was on paved path. This is a relative easy hike along the river. The view is great at every turn. Once you get to the Foot Bridge, you have a front view of Vernal Falls in a distant. If you have time and energy, continue to hike toward Vernal Falls on rocky trail lead to the Mist Trail. Bring a rain cover since you’ll get wet from the Vernal Falls mist on the Mist Trail. The Mist Trail is carved on the side of the mountain with many wet steps, so be careful. The Mist Trail is facing the Vernal Falls, wonderful view.Mirror LakeMirror Lake has water in the Spring but dry in the summer and Fall. The hike to Mirror Lake was mostly on paved road, easy walk but long. I won’t go there when the lake is dry.Lodging in the valleyLodging at Curry Village is great for kids because they have several kids program throughout the day. And there is the activity center where you can rent a raft for river rafting in late Spring/early Summer. The Curry Village lodging is basic and rusty. They have canvas tents and cabins. The cabins are very old and small. Feel like you're very close to nature. If you’re looking for something updated, pay a bit more and choose the more upscale Yosemite Lodge. Some Yosemite Lodge rooms have the view of the Yosemite Falls. If you need luxury, then choose the Ahwahnee Hotel. The free shuttle connects these lodgings and viewpoints. The price of lodging is high. The food quality at Curry Village and Yosemite Lodge are average to barely acceptable at a high price. We like the Yosemite Lodge because it’s updated at a great location, very close the Yosemite Falls. All lodging in the valley fill up fast so you do need to make reservation months in advance.","June 9, 2014",Very Scenic,305,"Boston, Massachusetts",5
Yosemite Valley,"If you visit Yosemite National Park with the intent of doing some serious hiking you might want to hike the Four Mile Trail, Panorama Trail, Upper Yosemite Falls, Vernal & Nevada Falls, and Half Dome if you can get a permit. All of these hikes are considered Strenuous according to the Yosemite Valley Hiking Map. I have completed all of these hikes at least two times and want to share a hike with visitors to Yosemite who want a fantastic workout. The hike is the Snow Creek Trail and is only about 9.5 miles round trip from the Mirror Lake Bus Stop. The first 2.5 miles are easy as you walk to the trailhead (stay to the left side of Mirror Lake); enjoy this warm up because you will need it. You will reach the trailhead which has a sign with the Snow Creek Trail written on it. What you are not aware of is that now you will be hiking 2600 feet of elevation in 1.3 miles before reaching the Snow Creek Trail. This trail is difficult because there are really no flat areas to give your legs a rest like all the other tough hikes in Yosemite. From Mirror lake you can look up to the top of Half Dome if you look to the right. After you have reached the top of the Snow Creek Trail you will feel like you are right across from the top of Half Dome. My recommendations are start early because you will be doing a lot of this hike in the sun, sunscreen in a must because of the amount of sweating you will be doing, bug spray, and plenty of water. I had taken (3) liters of water and ran out with two miles to the finish of this hike. It is not a good feeling to need water and none is available to drink.

Yosemite Valley,"From the sequoias in the Mariposa Grove to the waterfalls, El Capitan to the Half Dome, Yosemite is a grand place to spend several days. Arriving mid-afternoon, the ranger suggested we spend the remainder of the day going to the Mariposa Grove, and we took a hike there. The next day we drove to the Valley, and we walked the 13 mile loop trail; except for the length, the walk was not difficult, and it wasn't crowded (as many of the other trails were). If you've not acclimated to the altitude, it is a good way to see a lot without being too short of breath. It was great to walk along the river and have views of the falls and mountains. We spent a second full day driving up to Tuolomne Meadows and stopping for short hikes, scenic vistas, and points of interest.","June 2, 2014","Add Yosemite to your ""Must See"" List",14,"Jamestown, North Dakota",5

On a scale from one to five, five being tops, the views are definitely a five. Now for the park issues that are heartburn. The vehicle traffic in this park in the afternoon is unbearable. The park traffic is bumper to bumper, and trying to locate a parking space is near impossible. We have noticed that starting early in the mornings, 7am, seems to take a little of the traffic edge off. The rest rooms at all the sites that we visited within our three days were deplorable. Of all the National Parks we have visited, Yosemite is the filthiest. If these rest room facilities were in a commercial business, the business would have been shut down. On a scale from one to five, five being tops, their rest rooms would score less than zero. All in all I rate the park as a one, and we would not return. The mass traffic and poor rest rooms make it not worth our effort for a return visit.","June 2, 2014",Yosemite National Park,37,"New Milford, Pennsylvania",1

They opened the road 2 days before we had to go home due to 4-6' of snow to our delight! Take it off our bucket list! Plenty of parking, shopping & sites to see. Waterfalls and more waterfalls!

I'm still trying to figure out why it took me so long to visit this National Treasure! Being our first time, it was a little confusing as to how to properly view the entire park but, the Park has a Great Shuttle System where you want to be sure to park in one of the parking lots and then jump on the shuttle that'll take you around to about 21 - 22 stops around the partk. Shuttle's run every 30 mins from 7 - 10am and every 15 mins from 10am - 7pm while resorting back to 30 mins from 7 - 10pm. You stop where you want and spend as much time at each locale that you need and then jump the shuttle to the next stop of your chooosing. If you want a spectacular lunch during the day, plan accordingly to be at stop #3 (Awahnee Hotel) where they've got a great bar/grill that was packed along with a great additional restaurant as well! I highly recommend the restaurant in the large auditorium sized room while taking in the construction as well! Truly a treasure within a treasure and the food/service was fantastic. Lunch was in the $20.00ish range +/- and certainly well worth it! Prime Rib Cheese Steak Sandwich was the Bomb!!!! (meaning GREAT!) Walk around the Hotel or visit a couple of the little shops and you'll enjoy! Overall I cannot say enough about the overall park and experience!

Yosemite Valley,"Towering granite walls, rushing waterfalls, and spreading meadows make this one of the top natural attractions in the world, every bit worthy of its lofty reputation. BUT do visit in April or May when there is water in the waterfalls--by August all but Vernal and Nevada falls on the Merced are dry. It also helps to be an early riser as the park roads rapidly fill up after 9 AM. We rose regularly before six and had the valley to ourselves.We also recommend a private guided photo tour through the Ansel Adams Gallery (located at the heart of Yosemite Village). Our guide was Kirk, and he knew every secret spot as well as being an expert and talented photographer. A bit pricey but truly a fabulous experience. Book well in advance through their website.","May 27, 2014",Nothing Else Like it in the US,2,"Brookline, Massachusetts",5
Yosemite Valley,"This a huge park with magnificent granite cliffs, streams and lakes. There are many walking trails from the easy to the truly difficult; full details of these, including trail maps (which we advise as their signs are misleading) and advice can be obtained from the visitor centre. As we only had the day here we chose to walk the trail from the Lower Yosemite Falls to Mirror Lake. This is a pleasant walk through woodland and by streams. There is also a free shuttle bus that will take you close to the lake if you can't make the walk, although you will have to walk the last mile, some of which is up hill.If you also plan to visit the Giant Sequoias at Mariposa Grove, you will need to build time into your day. They are about an hours drive from the Valley and you will need 2 to 3 hours to walk the trails.A tip. If you are visiting more than 3 National Parks it is worth getting an annual pass. At the time of our visit (May 2014) this was $80. With normal entry charges being $25 or $20 this soon pays for its self.

Yosemite Valley,"This is not a national park which can be covered in a Days trip but yet if you have one full day to spare then do visit it. I took the south entry of the valley via CA-99. You can then go ahead and park your car/vehicle at any of the key visitor parking locations. From there on you can take the internal free shuttle bus service. Driving to all attraction spots are not allowed so try using the shuttle. You can take the shuttle service and visit each of the point and spend as much time you want. The Yosemite fall and Mirror Lake are few of the spots which I visited and I would say it was great experience. Before planning your trip to the park, do check there official website for more detailed information. Sometime parking is a big problem so be prepared. People who love driving, the drive to Yosemite is worth the experience. The speed limit within the park entrance and some location is 35 mph to 25 mph but when you drive you will understand why so low speed.

The food services were good. There are bicycles and rubber rafts for rent. Everywhere you go in the park, you are constantly looking upward at the sheer majesty of the dramatic vertical granite valley walls and the numerous spectacular water falls.

Yosemite Valley,"This is a beautiful place with spectacular scenery. Unfortunately our stay was short and we only experienced the valley floor and a couple of short hikes from there. We would love to return and spend more time hiking in the area and seeing more of the park. However, for those who don't/can't hike or have limited time as we did, the valley drive gives an opportunity to enjoy the sights and some of the short trails that are accessible for everyone. As is typical in mountain locations, the weather can change quickly, especially in the spring, so I would recommend clothing that can be layered to accommodate the changing conditions, plus comfortable walking shoes. The short trails in the valley are easy to walk and mostly paved, but can be icy and slippery. The village has the basics with a well stocked food store for campers and hikers, but the cafeteria-type food service has limited choices and seems expensive.

If you have more time I love the drive over Tioga Pass and the hiking up there because it is less crowded. I would try to go in the off season and stay away from weekends and holidays because it is a busy place. If you come in from the Sonora route prepared to see large expanses of a burned forest. The fires last year burned hot and heavy on this route. The valley floor did not get burned and is always beautiful. If you love scenery and the mountains then you will like Yosemite.

At Tioga Pass (9950’) it was 41° and windy. Snow on the roadsides but none on the road. It was cloudy but not foggy so we got good views of the impressive mountains. We passed gigantic trees that were not all sequoias, such as the Jeffrey Pine (with its distinctive crocodile-looking bark). There was snow forecast in the high country and rain in Yosemite Valley. The views during our drive were awesome—so much granite rock face. When we got down to the valley floor the flora changed radically. We were seeing deciduous trees dressed in spring green. We saw lots of purple lupines and Pacific dogwood. We saw Bridleveil Falls in all of their glory, as well as Upper and Lower Yosemite Falls. The falls were terrific even though the winter of 2014 was not snowy and California is in drought. We passed by El Capitan and also had numerous wonderful views of Half Dome.

On the first half of the day we went down to the Valley of the Giant Sequoia Trees. If I had to say the sight of these beautiful magnificent trees was breathtaking, it would be an under-statement. The height of these trees just truly humbles you. One could just stand there, right next to the trees and watch how far up their branches go and be disturbed by nothing but the sound of water trickling down after the snow has melted during spring. The second half of our day was spent in the Yosemite Valley where we walked to the Bridal Veil falls and then settled down in one of the open spaces in front of The North Dome and watched the sunset. It's truly amazing to see the different colors of the sunlight being reflected on the rocks in silver and gold hues. One mustn't miss out on the beautiful heart carving on El Capitan. Definitely a place to add to everyone's bucket list of places to visit before they die.","May 3, 2014",Breathtaking...,5,"Mumbai, India",5

En route we went through a tunnel through a mountain and on exiting saw the bridal veil waterfall. We got up close and personal to the waterfall which exhilarating. After visiting the Ahwahnee for lunch we carried on to visit the Yosemite waterfall. Through out the drive, we saw vistas of natural beauty that were breath taking and no matter how we tried to capture on camera, what the eye saw could not be replicated.You definitely need to make the park a destination on its own as a day is not probably enough, never mind a whistle stop visit.There is a fee to enter the park and on exiting the park, from the north we were asked to show our entry tickets, so keep your tickets safe and don't lose them like we did.

Park in one area and use it to navigate around. Great bus drivers, too...offering ""short cuts"" so you don't have to ride all around the entire loop.Wonderful gift shop/grocery store. So much to see and so much to do. No wonder lodging and campground reservations are booked up from here to eternity!","April 30, 2014",The beauty brings tears to your eyes!,63,Illinois,5

Yosemite Valley,"I was going to do separate reviews for both Swinging Bridge and Valley View, but I couldn't find placeholders for the individual places so I'll cover them here.The valley has tons of places to go. Every where you look is a scenic view. When driving through the valley there are many places where you can just hop out of the car and start taking photos with any of the parks main features at the the backdrop. There's a view in the valley called Swinging Bridge. There is a dedicated parking lot for this just like some of the other spots. While the bridge does not 'swing' anymore the view hasn't changed. The bridge crosses the Merced River and gives you a perfect view of Yosemite Falls. This was one of my favorite stops in the park. It wasn't too crowded and the walk from the car wasn't far at all. The other side of the bridge opens up to a meadow that I think is park of one of the meadow trail hikes. The water of the river is cold, clear, and fast moving though no white water. Valley View is easy to miss if you are not paying attention. This is a classic Ansel Adams photo view. It's like tunnel view only it's down on ground level right up next to the river. Because it's lower you don't have Half Dome filling in the gap in between El Capitan and Bridalviel Falls. The parking here is more limited, but when we stopped there were several open spots. Depending on how high the river is you'll see a bunch of rocks and logs in front of you. Be careful if you try to climb on them.There are definetly other parts of the valley where Half Dome looms gigantic in the background or where you can get different shots of El Capitan. Many places you'll just have to pull over to the shoulder and get out. The one grip I have about the valley is the road system. There are too many one way roads, and left or right turn only. It's easy to get turned around if you don't have a map. We made a loop several times when we were trying to get to the food court, because we couldn't figure out how to get over there and we could just do a U turn.","April 30, 2014",Swinging Bridge and Valley View review,197,"Burleson, Texas",5
Yosemite Valley,"This has to be one of the most beautiful, uplifting places on the earth.....every way you look there is something to stop and gaze at - huge trees, the tallest waterfalls you can imagine, enormous boulders, rivers and granite rocks. We only visited for the day but I wish we could have stayed much much longer. There are trails all over the park, bike rentals and boat rentals (summer season) and the village has a cafe, shops and the Ansel Adams gallery who very kindly let us in even though they were just about to close. We were in an RV and were worried about parking but it turned out to not be a problem - I can imagine you will have to get in early during the high season though and I can see the shuttle buses getting very busy. All definitely worth it though as this is one of the places which will stay with you for a long time to come.","April 29, 2014",A must see...,64,"Huddersfield, United Kingdom",5

Yosemite Valley,"It is said that while Yosemite Valley makes up less than 10% of Yosemite National Park, it is the destination for about 90% of park visitors. It’s certainly with good reason as it is truly a magnificent setting with its thundering waterfalls, soaring granite walls, rivers, meadows and iconic granite features such as El Capitan and Half Dome. However, for hikers this means that the trails can be quite busy. In addition, due to the topography here there are many strenuous trails and easy trails, but there aren’t a lot of choices for those looking for a moderate-level hike. One good choice to address both dilemmas would be the Valley Floor Loop Trail.The trail is relatively flat but long – either 6.5 or 13 miles, depending on the route you take. NOTE: Before hiking this trail, be sure to get a trail map at the visitor center as there is very little signage along this trail and there are a few points along the trail where it is unclear which direction you’re supposed to proceed.One of the great features about this trail is that it is relatively uncrowded, plus you get a much better feel for the valley than you do when simply driving through. The recommended starting point is at the Camp Four tram stop. From there head toward the Upper Yosemite Falls trailhead until you get to the trailhead sign. Instead of heading up that trail, turn left and follow the trail along the shadow of the granite cliffs. Eventually, you will cross the road and continue your trek along the river. Another nice feature of this trail is that, unlike many of Yosemite’s trails, this trail isn’t totally exposed; there will be many areas where you will walk under a canopy of trees.Due to time constraints, we opted for the shorter version of the trail, which meant we crossed a bridge near El Capitan to reach the other side of the valley and the return portion of the loop. To experience the full 13 miles, you would hike past El Capitan all the way to Bridalveil Falls and back. Either way, after completing the Valley Floor Loop Trail, you can say with all confidence that you truly saw Yosemite Valley.","April 25, 2014",Hiking the Valley Floor Loop Trail,219,"Fullerton, California",4

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite valley is the central and most visited area of the park. Sure its beautiful, but overrated. First and foremost, there are some serious inconveniences. Parking space is insufficient and even if you find one, its a 10+ min walk to visitor center. From there on, depending on where you want to head, there is plenty more walking or bus rides involved. I travelled to Yosemite with a 15 month old and found the park to be lot less accessible than Yellowstone or even Grand Canyon. Its also very crowded all over, from eating joints to washrooms to parking. A number of roads are blocked (for service vehicle use only) and walking & use of shuttle service are the only options. Though it may work out very well for many, I was very disappointed, especially after great experience at Yellowstone where you could cover the entire park driving around.On the plus side, the waterfalls and the views are impressive.

I had lunch at The Ahwahnee and it was ok. The concierge was super nice to me even though I just went there for lunch. He explained me how to get around. The park also has a free shuttle which I did not use but it was always packed and driving people around. Glacier point is awesome and Vernal Falls are majestic! Good day trip!Negative Thing: I think they need to improve their signs. It is easy to get lost there.","April 16, 2014",Beautiful Place,53,"Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan",5
Yosemite Valley,"1. Yosemite Valley is the main destination for travelers visiting Yosemite National Park. They say that 90% of the visitors to the Park only visit the Valley. 2. There are three entrances to Yosemite National Park, in the north, the west, and the south. The north is through Groveland, the west through Mariposa, and the south through Fresno. All roads lead to the Yosemite Valley. There is a fourth entrance through the East, through Tioga Road, but that is closed during the winter and early spring.3. If you are coming in winter, be prepared for chain controls in the north and south. Chain controls in the west are less common, but have occurred, like on April 1st of this year.4. Daytime visitors should be prepared for long waits at the park entrances during peak season, where the $20 park entry fee, good for 7 days, is collected.5. If you are visiting for several days, you can either stay within the Park at one of the three lodges: Curry Village, Yosemite Lodge at the Falls, or the Ahwahnee, or stay outside the Park, and drive in each day. 6. During the spring and summer on weekends the park will be severely congested with bumper to bumper cars. Getting in and out of the park may take hours, and daytime parking all but filled up by mid morning. 7 If you are a daytime visitor, you may want to park in the visitor's parking lot, near Yosemite village. However this is a dirt parking lot, and will be muddy when it rains.8 Other places to park nearby are at the three lodges, and along side the counter clock wise running, one way loop road, running through the Valley.9. When you first drive into the valley, you should visit Bridalveil Falls, as it is close to the start of the loop. You can hike almost all the way under the Falls. By Fall these falls will be a trickle. Restrooms here. 10. Glacier Point is also in this area, but takes a drive to get to, along a long curvey road up the mountain. It just opened April 14, 2014 this year, and overlooks the Yosemite Valley. Glacier Point is not accessible in the winter, due to snow on the road. 11. As you drive into the valley, you will want to stop at Swinging Bridge to get a good view of Yosemite Falls, in the background, with the Merced river streaming underneath. 12. Once you are parked near Yosemite village, you may access the free Yosemite Valley bus shuttle.13. The shuttle gives you access to the Mist Trail and Mirror Lake, both not accessible by private vehicle (except those with handicap placards). Both of these stops have restrooms. 14. The upper Mist trail is closed in winter and early spring due to ice on the stairs. This year it opened in early March to hikers. 15. During the summer the Mist trail will be congested with hikers going up the hundreds of stairs, carved into the mountain, wet from the mist of the adjacent roaring Merced river.16. The Mist trail leads to Vernal Falls, with the John Muir trail continuing to Nevada Falls. 17 This is also the way to Half Dome, open only to 250 hikers per day, using a lottery system to get a permit. Rangers check the permits at the base of Half Dme, before hikers go up uisng cables drilled into the rock.18. Mirror Lake is the following stop after the Mist Trail stop on the Bus shuttle route, although it is possible to easily walk between the two stops. 19 Visitors may hike completely around Mirror Lake, past the landslide area, which has been cleared of rocks along the pathway.20 Mirror lake dries up gradually by late June, so the time to see it is in April, when waters are at their highest level. By late May the lake will become a shallow pond with weeds showing throughout the waters. 21 The best views of Mirror Lake are in the mid afternoon, when the shadows from the surrounding mountains of granite ease away from the Lake.22. After Mirror lake, the shuttle continues to the Ahwahnee, with it's majestic dining halls and sitting rooms. It's worth a look just to marvel at the interior of the most expensive hotel in the National Parks System. There are restrooms in the lobby area.23 If you continue on the shuttle, you will pass the Yosemite Village. Here you can get a bite to eat at the sandwich shops, and visit the museums and visitor center.24. Farther on, past the Yosemite village, is lower Yosemite Falls. Many daytime visitors park at Yosemite Lodge at the Falls, almost directly across the loop road from the the short trail leading to the Falls.25 This area is wheelchair accessible, and a short walk from the loop road to the base of the Falls. There are restrooms here, and plenty of benches around to view the falls. 26. Yosemite Falls becomes a trickle by late summer. This year, due to the drought, the water level is lower than even last year, when the falls dried up by early July. Best time to see the falls is March and April.27. Continuing on the shuttle takes us to Camp 4, which is the trail head for hiking past columbia Point to the top of upper Yosemite Falls. This area is walkable from Yosemite Lodge at the Falls.28. The final stop on the free bus shuttle is Yosemite Lodge at the Falls. A number of Park excursions, including the Valley Tour, originate from this point. The lobby area has public restrooms.29. Yosemite Lodge at the Falls has a bike rental area, where you can rent a cruiser for $31 a day, or a bike with a child trailer for $80 a day. The Valley is ideally suited for bicycle riding, with it's level grounds and asphalt paved pathways.30. Yosemite Lodge has a number of evening programs in it's outside theater. And the Mountain Room Restaurant is one of the better places to eat in the Valley.","April 15, 2014",30 tips for enjoying Yosemite Valley,1950,"Sunnyvale, CA",5

Yosemite Valley,"Nature has created the most amazing place on earth, and to describe it will always fall short, that is, you MUST see it to believe it!! The majestic walls of granite and other varied stone frame the most gorgeous valley on earth. I think whichever human laid eyes on it for the first time, thought they'd found the Garden of Eden or Shangri-La. There's much to see, perhaps too much for 1-2 days, but enough to beckon you back for a re-visit. If time is limited, the guided bus tour the Rangers provide is excellent and well narrated and perhaps the best ""tease"" for a future longer stay. The employees are very proud of their workplace.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is located in the Western Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, about 200 miles directly east of San Francisco. Yosemite Valley is the centerpiece of Yosemite National Park and I think is the main attraction in the Park. Yosemite Valley is home to many of the famous waterfalls and cliffs that make Yosemite National Park famous. This park is an international destination as there are visitors from all over the world. I was amazed at how many people near me in the restaurants and on the shuttle bus were not speaking English.I went to Yosemite Valley in late July with my wife and we had a fantastic time. I think it is one of the most amazing places in the USA. We stayed at the Yosemite Lodge at the Falls which is next to Yosemite Falls and is near the center of the Valley. If you visit make sure you stay in the Valley to maximize your time there (as you will spend a lot of time driving to and from your hotel if you stay outside the park). If it is your first trip to the Valley I recommend that you go on a Yosemite Valley Tram Tour. Park Rangers are the tour guides and give you the highlights of the Valley and help you learn the names of the major natural wonders. We took this tour and really enjoyed it as the Rangers talk about being Park Rangers as well as telling you about the Valley Highlights.The Valley is pretty long (about 7.5 miles) so it is hard to explore on foot (unless you are there for a long time). Renting a bike is a great way to see the Valley. There are bike paths and lightly used roads that bikers can use. My wife and I really enjoyed biking through the Valley and I highly recommend renting a bike (we rented from a booth next to our Valley hotel). If you are not into biking there is a free shuttle service available year-round in eastern Yosemite Valley and, in summer, as far west as El Capitan. There are shuttle stops near all the major Valley sites. The shuttles were never completely full (especially in the evening). Overall I loved Yosemite Valley and highly recommend it. If you have never been before and are entering through the south entrance of the Park, stop at Glacier Point for your first view of the Valley. Your second view will then be from the tunnel on Wawona Road. The only negative thing about the Valley is that it is so amazing and popular that it becomes extremely crowded in the summer.","April 13, 2014",One of the most amazing places in the USA,833,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5

If you haven't visited Yosemite, then you missed the best of California. I have yet to find a picture that can do it justice. I'm not sure which is more spectacular ... winter when the sun is setting and the mantel of snow glows golden or spring when the waterfalls are cascading everywhere. I always stay in the valley so that I can hear the waterfalls at night.","April 12, 2014",Yosemite ... Mother Nature's Cathedral,2,"Glendale, California",5

Be careful about the time of year you visit, however, we arrived in early April and there was a LOT of snow which made it difficult to see everything.

Yosemite Valley,"I got to SF reasonably often on business and having 'done' SF a bunch of times decided to go further afield. This was to Yosemite, with another colleague end of August. We spent the week in SF on a business trip and Friday lunchtime we drove to Mariposa in the evening (it being the nearest hotel we could book to Yosemite at the time (or without spending a fortune). We stayed in a cheap hotel and got up at about 4.30AM. We drove to Glacier Point in the dark (I have TomTom with USA on it, live by that mapping system!). And arrived just before 6.30. Chatting to the RV we had followed much of the way he'd swerved to avoid a bear! We then watched sunrise over the valley and it was breathtaking. Half Dome and Curry Village and seeing the colour change in the rocks as the sun rose higher. Then we drove down into the village and stopped at Tunnel Point for some pictures. It's simply breath-taking view from their. We then parked up and proceeded to hike a lot of the valley floor after buying some supplies from the village shop. We got to the base of El-Capitan (and had a sleep on a rock for 40 minutes) , and a couple of the waterfall points Yosemite Fall. (very small in late august, but still cool). We actually went up to the base of one of the waterfalls and got a picture of the pool there after a scramble up some rocks. We went through El-Capitain Meadows and hiked along the river and basically spent the day and probably 10-12 miles just hiking along the valley. We went to Touloume Grove on the way out (photos do not do the Redwoods justice, you have to see them to believe them. I was saying to my colleague as we walked down the grove of giant sequoias , themselves huge' How do we recognised a Redwood' just as we turned the corner and saw one. Wow! It's a bit of treck back uphill from Toloume grove though so be prepared for the walk back.Then we drove the 4 hours back to SF (thanks 5 Hour Energy for making the return possible!). And had a couple of well earned beers before slinking into a deep slumber.I'm going back with the family next year.

I would highly recommend taking advantage of the mass transit that is easily available here. The disadvantage of visiting in the off-season is that the only thing really open is the Yosemite Valley. However, I do not feel disappointed, as it is truly stunning. A trip I'm glad I crossed off my bucket list. Block out enough time to pull over and take pictures and do a hike (even a small one).

The morning is fresh, so you just have to carry snacks, water, a hat, sunglasses, sunscreen and good hiking shoes. During the evening it's a bit cold and snowy. We stayed in a non heated cabin, if you do the same, make sure you have a sleeping bag or proper blankets. My friends had just common ones and they were cold. Curry Village is very worth for the price. Beautiful views, a market near by, decent restaurant, clean hot showers, great staff. Don't drive in the park, it's just unecessary. Park your car and take the shuttles. They go everywhere. Also be careful with the animals, so pack your food properly! There're a lot of short hikes with beautiful valley views but of course, as a hiking lover, I went to a longer one! I took the upper Yosemite Falls Trail and didn't regret! Took my time, enjoying it. It took us 7 hours. It gets really steep by the end but the feeling of getting on top it's describeless.

Lots of trailheads for outstanding hikes, visitor centers, galleries, shops, eateries, and beautiful scenery.

Yosemite Valley,"The crowds are gone and Yosemite NP is transformed into a slow moving paradise. Usually in December you will see two seasons. If there is snow in the upper valley, you will see winter and many times in the lower valley (nearer the entrance by Bridal Veil Fall) you will still see the auburn leaves of the oak trees. If there is a little sun in the afternoon, the leaves literally light up. It seems though that the water volume of all the falls have diminished over the years. In the winter, the volume is negligible. If you are only going for the water, visit in June. Of course you get the bumper to bumper traffic and have difficulty getting reservations. If you do visit in the summer months, you can avoid some of the traffic by getting there at sun up and you will have 2-3 hours of no rush hour. After 10:00 the races start. It is a completely different place in Winter. You are likely to see some animals down in the valley in winter too because of the colder temps 4000 feet higher. The recent fire did not touch the park attractions. However there is a lot of devastation if you take the road to Groveland. It was a really big fire. The Mariposa road area was not affected. Yosemite National Park is a national treasure. You just have to know when to visit.","February 8, 2014",An Awesome Place To Visit In December,61,LEBANON,5

The panoramic views from here are awesome, water, rock faces, trees, water fall, mountains, and wildlife, it's the best view of nature we have ever encountered. And with all the snow and ice it was truly a winter wonderland. You can easily look from the bridge for an hour. There is no fee for the bridge, only to enter the park.

Yosemite Valley,"What a great way to start off the New Year -- a visit to Yosemite in January! The room rates were reduced, the people few and far between, the Valley quiet and peaceful and the deer and coyotes quite active. In fact, we saw a herd of bucks jousting, banging their large rack of antlers together. As we walked along the very calm Merced River, we enjoyed the reflections of trees and granite cliffs. There was a light snow melting on the ground and the days were unseasonably warm for winter ... in fact, we hiked in shirtsleeves and tied our jackets around our waists just in case. The hike along the dirt footpath between the Ahwahnee Hotel and Mirror Lake was fantastic ... the path wound through boulders the size of houses, there were rock stairs, it was just amazing. And, we never saw another soul the whole hike! Another day we hiked to the bridge with a view of Vernal Falls and again, only saw about a half dozen others on the trail. That would never be the case in Spring or Summer.

The scenery is absolutely stunning! I lived in Kalispell, near Glacier National Park, so have experienced other parks, but the rock formations here are incredibly magestic! The National Park fee was $20.00 which allows you to come & go for up to 5 days. There were many mule deer wandering around & across the road, so keep an eye out for them!

One of California's most formidable natural landscapes, Yosemite National Park is famous for its spectacular granite cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, Sequoia groves, and biological diversity. Yosemite was central to the development of the national park idea. At there you can do multiple things like hiking, rafting in Merced River, professional photography, camping, horseback riding, biking, snowshoeing at the Badger Pass, and skiing.","January 16, 2014",US top place to visit Yosemite National Park,1,"New York City, New York",5

The landscapes, rock formations, waterfalls and forests are just beautiful. You really can not put it's beauty into words....just go....see it for yourself and if you can, stay a few days.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite National Park I visited in august 2013• Absolutely stunning scenery in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in east central California• The iconic granite rock formation Half Dome• Tons of hiking trails and footpaths, through meadows, by waterfalls, up cliffs, and more• Beautiful flora, including lavender lupine, irises, pine trees, and wildflowersKnown for its stunning sites, breathtaking beauty, and protected nature, Yosemite National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most flocked-to sites in the United States. There has always been a push to protect Yosemite's land, starting in the late 1800s when President Lincoln signed a bill granting the area to the State of California.Now, travelers visit Yosemite from all over the world to get a glimpse of the granite cliffs, clean steams, giant sequoia forests, and waterfalls. Cars are a popular way to tour the park, but during the summer, when the park experiences a surge in visitors, shuttles may be a better option. Yosemite Valley is the home to all of what Yosemite is known for -- the grand cliffs, serene meadows, and unusual rock formations. Looking for the typical Yosemite experience we stayed in tent. The sites are all well spaced out and there is wonderful scenery surroundings..TOILETS: are in great condition and all within 50m walk away from camp site.SHOWERS: are not here. Nearest showers are located in the housekeeping camp at Curry Village. Though you can clean yourself in the river (no soap allowed understandably).FOOD: bring your own or eat in restaurants. But better stock up before you arrive.BEARS: we didn't see any over three days.. anywhere. The rangers are really informative and educate all visitors. Nothing to fear here.In the evenings there is an amphitheatre around a campfire where the rangers tell stories and teach you about the park and its history.

Yosemite Valley,"My family went to Yosemite Park this past New Year’s. This means that we traveled during the off-season, when many attractions are closed, despite the lack of snowfall. This left the entire park in confusion. Staff don’t know what is open and what is closed. The website is no help either, as dates are out-dated. Badger Pass Ski area said it would open Dec 13, but since there was no snow, it was still closed. They need a better way of sending out information. The mountaineering school was still open, but no one at the Yosemite Lodge knew, so we had to go to the visitors center, which then told us to go to Curry Village, when then directed us to the Mountaineering school. It would have been so much easier if somewhere along the way, there was like a number we could call or something—but that would have been too obvious. Additionally, we tried to eat at Wawona hotel, but the reservation desk said it was closed for the season. We go to Wawona just to check it out, and turns out it was completely open for business (too bad we had already eaten the sub-par food at Yosemite Lodge). Logistics aside, visiting Yosemite was great for the scenery. We stayed at the Lodge at Yosemite Falls, which is run by DNC companies. (See my review for that one for more details). Be prepared to either bring your own food, or spend lots of money on the food inside the park. If this is your first time visiting, I would definitely recommend staying in the Valley, as it is most conducive to tourists. We did go to Wawona on our way out to see Mariposa Grove and the Giant Sequoias, which is definitely worthwhile (this road is also variable in the winter, however. Snow will close it because roads are precarious). Maybe next time we’ll stay at Tenaya or Toulomne. Warning: temperatures can vary by 40 degrees in the winter. At night, it drops to about 30 degrees, whereas in the morning, standing in the sun, it is about 70 degrees. Be prepared for all kinds of weather.I would recommend Yosemite in the winter, as there were less people, and it was not as hot. There are less things to do, however (like the El Capitan bus does not run, some trails are closed (including Half-Dome), some concessions aren't open, and Happy Isles Nature Center is closed (despite them announcing it at the stop on the shuttle bus)), but again, try to do your research ahead of time if there is something in particular that you want to do (and maybe call someone else to get a second opinion if the first source says it’s closed).","January 9, 2014",Going during the winter?

However, the air and skies were clear when we arrived. We could have spent a week. We visited Glacier Point with exceptional views of the surrounding mountains and granite cliffs. We followed that with visiting Yosemite Valley. We encountered no crowds and were in awe of the climbers on El Capitan. We could have spent the whole day watching them. Yosemite falls was just a trickle, due to the time of year. The second day was spent traveling through Tioga Pass in route to Nevada. Again, impressive mountain and lake scenery we did not expect.

Our camp ground was cancelled due to the fire, but we ended up finding another camp ground (which usually books out) on the other side of the park due to cancellations from the fire. We stayed at Tuolumne Meadows and we were right near a little store and cafe, which was perfect.

There are way too many cars. We were there in November and still the parking lots looked like a big box store. The FREE shuttle bus was never even half full. If you want nutritious, balanced food at a reasonable price, pack it in and get a room at The Lodge by the Falls. These rooms come with a dorm-sized fridge. With some additional planning, you will not have to settle for high priced, processed food that is on offer in the park. For example: My husband had: 2 cups of white spaghetti noodles with a red sauce and some ?hamburger? with a white bun brushed with oil and salty ?cheese?I had: 1 cup bagged lettuce with two tasteless grape tomatoes, four slices of cucumber and a packet of Newman's light Italian dressing in a plastic clam shell and the fruit and cheese plate that consisted of approx 5oz brie, 10 grapes, a tiny wedge of underripe melon, two white mini bagels and four slices of white ?sourdough? bread on a bread plate wrapped in plastic.We paid $27. This was in the cafeteria. We could have bought much more, higher quality food for much less had I planned ahead and been aware there was a fridge in our room. We did find smoked salmon in one of the stores. That, paired with some whole grain tortillas and the apples and peanut butter we brought made a good lunch.

Yosemite Valley,"For years we've heard that a trip to Yosemite has to be on your bucket list of places you want to visit. We are now wondering why we waited so long. The park is huge, there is no way you can see the entire area in a week or even a month. We can thank the efforts of John Muir who convinced President Theodore Roosevelt to sign a bill putting Yosemite under the federal government that saved the giant sequoia from loggers and the upper meadows from sheep.The park is the size of Rhode Island dotted with thousands of lakes and ponds. The valley is only 1 per cent of the total area but is the most widely visited. Tunnel View is the first view of the valley that travelers have of El Capitan and the granite domes. El Capitan is a popular climbing destination that climbers from around the world come to climb. At night you can see their lights on the cliff face.I don't think there is an off season to come here. We came in autumn and enjoyed the fall colors and the cool nights. We missed seeing the numerous falls that the spring melt produces and maybe that will be our next visit.","November 20, 2013",A National Gem of a Park,66,"Houston, Texas",5

Yosemite Valley,"We knew in advance that the dates we selected to travel to Yosemite were in ""dry"" season and that waterfalls, if visible, would be but a dribble. We encountered a number of Europeans while hiking who did NOT know this and were very disappointed which is why I have titled my review this way. The waterfalls are best seen in Spring or early Summer but those are , of course, the busiest travel periods to this area. The Valley ""energy"" is still vibrant and palpable, however, even with thinner crowds and thinner crowds mean more solitude on the trails which was a HUGE attraction for us. Plus, we hit the leaf color change period just right. There was a rainbow of colors everywhere we turned. Four Mile Hike ( 8 1/2 roundtrip ) and Upper Yosemite Falls trails begin in the Valley and are both challenging and afford spectacular views at the end.We did NOT stay in the Valley as accommodations were either too expensive or rustic ( who wants to hike in the middle of the night to locate a bathroom? NOT us.) Instead, we rented a cabin from The Redwoods in Yosemite . This cabin community is 22 miles away or an easy 45 minute drive or, in season, you can take the shuttle from Wawona. I would STRONGLY recommend that property group. Can't say enough good things about their units and staff. They happily agreed to keep close tabs on us as we daily updated them on our hiking itinerary in the event we became lost. ( which we have had a tendency to do now on several occasions, once resulting in an unplanned overnight in the woods in another NP) Anyway, Yosemite should be a must see destination on everyone's travel list, especially those looking to combine vigorous exercise with magnificent scenery.","November 14, 2013",No waterfalls in late October but colors spectacular,187,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5

It is a high point overlooking the entire valley with the best views of Half Dome.The overlook stop just before the tunnel on the road going south out of the park is also a special place to see. We found the facilities within the park to provide average food for high prices. The best place to visit and eat is the Alwahnee Hotel. Food and drink there were very good, but also expensive. It is architecturally interesting. We took the two hour bus tour leaving from Yosemite Lodge. It was very well done, provided lots of information and made stops along the way for photo shoots. It was very dry in October and the waterfalls were almost non-existent. We did see a bear and several deer. f you are a senior, the one time purchase of a national park pass for $10 gets you, your passengers and your car into the park at no cost.","November 3, 2013",Spectacular Scenery,142,"W.

Yosemite Valley,"This was one of the highlights we wanted to see on our group tour of SW USA. We were left hanging until very late on the tour whether we would be able to go in because of the government shutdown. Luckily, we heard a day or so before we were due to visit that the park was going to be open! What a relief!! Unfortunately, we were only due a short visit to Yosemite on our way to San Francisco and we could have stayed for a whole lot longer. The scenery was beautiful and the park of a huge scale that we cannot conceive of in the UK. We managed in our limited time to have a short walk from Yosemite Lodge to the Lower Yosemite Falls and, once away from the lodge area with its traffic and people, the silence was astonishing. You could literally hear the silence. We wondered what it would be like in a really quiet time, say at night! A lovely, lovely place; we are thinking about the possibility of returning for a walking holiday in conjunction with the Grand Canyon. Do not miss this place!!","November 1, 2013",Beautiful location,38,"Buntingford, United Kingdom",5

Two beautiful days with amazing weather. Wish we would have had one more day, but two is better than none. Don't miss Glacier Point, Vernal Falls Hike, Mariposa Grove and just take some time to sit in the middle of one of the meadows and soak up some sun taking in all the beauty surrounding you.","October 24, 2013",Beautiful Park when finally let in after shutdown.,82,"Lancaster, Pennsylvania",4
Yosemite Valley,"What a place. What an experience. We only had a day to see it and we decided to follow the recommendations and stick to the Valley. We did a couple of light hikes and mostly rode the shuttle to every possible stop around the park. Nothing can prepare you for the shock to the system upon the first sight of the big rocks and mountains that furrowing the Valley. Everywhere you look it feels like postcard material. It is all so beautiful, serene and humbling to be honest. It is an absolute must see. Even if for a day only. It is easily one of the most beautiful places we've ever been to.","October 23, 2013",Yesssss,61,"London, United Kingdom",5
Yosemite Valley,"What a disappointment! We reserved a rental home near Yosemite National Park beginning October 1st. That's right, the day the National Government Shutdown. We decided to head to the park anyway only to fine almost every car in front of us being turned away. When we approached the gate, we simply told them we had business on the other side of the park - and they let us pass through! We were cautioned to drive straight through without stopping at the turnouts, etc. Well, all the turnouts were full of others who passed through before us. Now we could not get into Yosemite Valley, but we did get to see Half Dome (from a distance) and several other hot spots. All facilities were closed (including all bathrooms and portapotties). We did get to ride the northern ridge and view the devastation from the recent fires. We will just have to return in the future to see what we missed.","October 23, 2013",Yosemite During Government Shutdown,58,"Woodstock, Georgia",2
Yosemite Valley,"My 3 kids and I were incredibly lucky to get our last National Park camping booking in before the Government shut down.....how bizarre was that? I found out they make $70 million a day from National Parks and Monuments.......hope your government agrees on a budget soon so that people from around the world can experience your amazing National Parks and monuments like Statue of Liberty and Alcatraz. We were very lucky that we got to camp at Grand Canyon, Zion National Park, Kodachrome Basin State Park (much nicer than Bryce Canyon camping area and not far away), and here at Yosemite NP. The government closed down the parks 2 days after we had left and headed to San Francisco and I was blissfully unaware of what had happened! I can truly empathise with people that had trips planned to National Parks after the shut down!! I do realise how lucky I was! This was my 3rd time visiting Yosemite (1st with my kids) and the main reason I wanted to camp here and sat up till midnight (OZ time) 5 months before our intended visit was because the last time I visited over 15 years ago I remember NOT being able to find a car parking spot to even park the car and go on a walk to view the beautiful waterfalls!! I'm guessing it's probably one of the busiest National Parks in the USA?? I was SO excited when we secured our camping spot.....for me....it was actually securing a car parking space! My kids were thrilled when I told them we were walking to the top of a waterfall (NOT)......Vernal Falls....it was one of 2 falls that were flowing......gotta say....this was a tough but rewarding walk..and we are pretty fit....did it in less than the time they suggested but boy it was HARD......it's not a huge distance but its UP, UP, UP...then obviously down, down, down...almost harder going down than up because our legs were shaking by then......gotta say...as much as my daughters complained....we all felt a massive sense of achievement when we reached the TOP of the falls. And note to anyone.....DO NOT ENTER THE FALLS......I bought this book called ""Off the Wall....Death in Yosemite"" and I have to say....it's a very interesting book. It truly is amazing how many people get mesmerized by waterfalls and ""want to venture closer""! Great book for my kids to read whilst we were camping.....and needless to say...not a toe ventured in the water EVER! Interesting fact that the average age of someone going over the falls has gone from 20'ish to now 30'ish.....just goes to show.....we need to get wiser with age. There were 12 bears wandering the valley whilst we were camping (apparently.... as advised by the park rangers but we didn't see one.....kind of hoping but ....)....anyway, can highly recommend this park (apart from having NO dish washing facilities) and we loved the lounge at the Curry Village area (which is where you can go to have a shower).....more importantly the kids LOVED that they could sit in the lounge and every table had a power point to recharge their phones and ipads etc.......and the PIZZA place just outside served the most awesome pizza (and they served a decent glass of red whilst you waited)!! All in all.......a spectacular park and a fantastic experience!","October 21, 2013",CAMPING WAS AWESOME!,27,"Sydney, Australia",5

We drove around the national park quite a bit, if you are planning on doing the same, make sure your car is topped up with fuel. They do have a few petrol stations but obviously not as many as in cities. Also recommend to go early in the morning to avoid crowds and make the most out of your day (plus this way you are likely to leave the national park before it gets too dark to drive).

We drove in to the visitors centre and booked the Valley floor tour. This was really enjoyable and our guide Brian made it so interesting....he explained so much but in a way that was easily understood. The $20 entrance fee lasted for a week and would have been very good value had the park remained open.We would certainly recommend a visit and would hope to get back again ourselves some time in the future.","October 17, 2013",Wow!!,12,"Belfast, United Kingdom",5

We went to the park the day before the US Government closed down the parks and we count ourselves truly lucky that we were able to see the spectacle. At one point, in the bottom of the valley, we walked two miles and apart from the very occasional car, we didnt see another soul. There was a little family of deer hiding in the grass as we were walking back to the lodge and we just stood and stared at each other, before we said goodbye and wandered on our way. There are cycles for hire but we just wanted to meander through the scenery and we honestly felt at one with nature.","October 15, 2013",Awesome,144,"Yorkshire, UK",5

Yosemite Valley,"I suppose the fact that - on our first visit ever - we drove past an evening sun - lit El Capitan and didn't go 'wow' was an indicator that the Valley wasn't going to be a top spot for us.Wildly over-rated, its sheer volume of cars, people, bikes,noise completely reduces the impact of the granite wall scenery; although I realise now that sheer rock walls don't offer enough variety of colour and form to interest me after the first contemplation.Maybe because we'd recently arrived from the Canadian Rockies, the Valley views were a little underwhelming.Or maybe it's been subject to just a little too much hype.Up high at Glacier Point and Sentinel Dome, the views to Half Dome were fantastic - but at the end of the day, that is pretty much it.It is the same, single mountain,its lower slopes clothed deeply in impenetrable forest,seen from slightly different angles.Much lovelier and more inspiring, was the High Sierra up on the Tioga Road - once you got above that endless treeline - with its crystal clear lakes,distant views and beautifully sculpted mountains.I never thought I'd feel this way about a place I had dreamed of visiting ever since I got hooked on John Muir's beautiful writing.The Valley itself has some lovely meadow land but it is such a human circus and clothed in such deep forest,we felt very little inclination to stay long there.","October 12, 2013",Not the best place to appreciate some fine scenery...it's a human circus,623,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",3

Yosemite Valley,"After we travel thousands of kilometers (or miles, as stubbornly this great country of North America insists), cruising the deserts of Arizona and Nevada, Grand Canyons and great trails, the mountains of Tioga Pass, we arrived at this valley which was bestowed by mother nature as one of the most beautiful on Earth. But it has to be highlighted by the professionalism with which the U.S.National Park Service treats its monumental parks. There are not only beautiful landscapes and fascinating trails, all of which, in the hands of amateurs and poor public administration (as in my tropical country) would be a Wonder of Nature left to its own luck.Not here. They have adequate human services, beyond what the planet decided to distribute over its surface. The natural beauties are for all tastes, look for your own .The first significant interaction I had with this park was in the 80s , through the film Star Trek V , where Kirk scales the iconic El Capitan, always observerd by an admired Mr. Spock hovering at his side with a floating device.I did not tried to do the same as the captain of the Enterprise (maybe 20 years ago, i would), but I would like to have at my disposal the flying machine of Spock .At least, touch your hands the rock that stands out among many attractions.Worth and worth a lot .","October 9, 2013",Life long and prosper,11,"Sao Vicente, SP",5

Unfortunately, there was not an awful lot of water coming down, but I would imagine after the snow melt in spring, it would be spectacular.

The next day we drove up Glacier Point Road and hiked to Sentinel Dome. The views would have been breathtaking but we were unable to see due to smoke and haze. The trail was still interesting, though. We stopped at Glacier Point on the way down and what a spectacular view - if there is no smoke/haze! This is a must do on any trip to Yosemite! The vistas are gorgeous from this vantage point.Mid-week a rainstorm came and cleared the air. The next day we hiked from the Happy Isles trailhead to the footbridge. I am in my early 50's and thought I was in good shape but found this hike very doable but challenging. My friend has had knee surgery so we opted not to continue past the footbridge below Vernal falls, but our husbands climbed up the mist trail to Vernal Falls, the Emerald Pool and Nevada Falls and reported it as challenging but exhilerating. The challenge is mostly coming down as that is harder on the joints and knees. This hike makes you very thirsty, so do bring PLENTY of water. Would recommend sturdy tennis shoes or boots for this hike. We also drove south to the the Mariposa Groves/Wawona to see the Giant Sequoias. Stunning! Also a must see. We parked at the Wawona general store and took the bus in (as recommended - when it says there is limited parking, they are not kidding) to the Groves. We decided to take the open air tram tour and were glad we did. It comes with an audio guide that explains the history of the grove, scientific facts about the trees, etc. and is very informative. The tram makes two photo op stops but when you exit, you can leave your audio guide with the driver and just hike on your own if you need more time. After the tour we went back to Wawona and toured the little pioneer area on our own. There were some interesting things there (wagons, covered bridge, cabins, jail, etc.) but everything was locked. This could have been an interesting site if there were actors playing the parts of pioneers or if there was another audio guide to explain what early life in Southern Yosemite was like. There were placards in front of the cabins and a little handout just before the covered bridge, but the amount of information was very brief. We also hiked around the valley floor, saw countless mule deer (who are very used to people and were quite close), squirrels, birds, marmots and two bobcats (by Stoneman Bridge)! We had dinner two nights at the Ahwahnee main dining room. The atmosphere in the rustic dining room/lodge and the live music was amazing. The food was fresh and tasted great. In my opinion, though, the food was overpriced for what was served and the wine list was way way overpriced. I feel there should be wines offered at different price points. Most were over $100 a bottle. Luckily we had stopped at Trader Joe's in Fresno for wine before heading in to Yosemite. We stored the bottles in our room fridge and some nights drank them on the patio before dinner and some nights we sipped while playing games in the main lobby. We also ate at the Ahwahnee bar area (good) a pizza shop (Degnan's PIZZA - just OK) a sub shop (Degnan's SUBS - REALLY fresh and good!) and burgers and breakfast in Curry Village (OK). In the past we have always camped or stayed at the tent cabins in Curry Village. This time we splurged on the Ahwahnee Hotel. Here are some random thoughts:- Room was on third floor - had two windows with spectacular views- Lovely small box of chocolates were there when we arrived (Yum!)- Bed was comfortable- Could easily control room temp and it worked well- Having fridge was great- Had a hard time applying my make-up in the evening - hardly any room/shelf space in the bathroom. -Hotel had to turn off hot water for three hours to work on it. Luckily this was done between midnight and 3:00 am so it did not impact us.- Pool is nice and refreshing. Clean. Towels provided in cupboard as you enter pool but some clean towels were scattered on loungers-Liked the bar area for breakfast and lunch - great service there-Liked the sweet/wine shop-Gift shop had very unique items and whoever is the buyer has done a great job.-Loved the high tea in the afternoons - live pianist and great service -Disappointed there was no salon. Fine dining after physical hikes...I could have used a little extra help in the hair and nails department. (There is a massage service. We did not try it but heard good reviews from several guests.)-Disappointed we missed the historical tour of the hotel. We thought it was offered every day and were planning on going mid-week. Recommend writing which days tours of hotel are offered on the Daily Activity sheet so that guests can plan accordingly. There is a brochure, but I imagine the tour is much better.-Had two male waiters attending our table first night in main dining room. One was great but we felt the other was condescending. When we asked questions about the menu, he answered tersely as if he could not be bothered. We almost did not go back because of this. The second night we had two female waitresses and they were great and more than made up for the apathetic waiter from previous dinner. Happily this was the only employee at the Ahwahnee that did not give great service. Everyone else was superb.Had a great time in Yosemite Valley despite the smoke and haze the first few days. Hope the fire is soon contained and does not threaten any more of this pristine national treasure.","September 18, 2013",Yosemite,25,"Dallas, Texas",5
Yosemite Valley,"If you do nothing else, visit Yosemite and Sequoia National parks. Both will delight and inspire. This is the playground for many Californians with camping and hiking. It's easy to see why, there is so much to see and do and the scenery runs from the ordinary to the amazing. Sadly when we visited there was little water running as the state is experiencing very low seasonal rainfall, but we still managed to paddle in some streams (not streams in the winter!) and watch people doing some prospecting/panning for gold. The air is so fresh and clean and the roads were relatively quiet. There are plenty of places to stop, look, walk and enjoy. It's so nice to see such minimal commercialism, although the small settlements surrounding the park have a much more local feel about them, with some nice little cafes and restaurants. We only had a day here due to other things to see, but would loved to have had several days here as there was much to see and do. $20 to spend a day in the park (or longer if you stay within the park itself) is a small price to pay. Great roads in and out, winding up and down the valleys - watch the bends and stop at the vista points as and where you can if you are time restricted like we were. There are free shuttle buses within the park and trails/hikes that go from easy to extreme.Take time to enjoy and don't get pushed by idiots who want to drive around at breakneck speeds, sadly there were a number of these but the park rangers sorted a few out. Look out for the bears and other wildlife.","September 15, 2013",California dreaming,114,"Cambridge, United Kingdom",5

Yosemite Valley,"Took my family to visit Yosemite National Park while we were staying in Bass Lake for the week. We went mid week in late August, so it wasn't too crowded. The park is only 15 miles from Oakhurst, but because the roads are windy, the going is slow. If you get car sick, Dramamine is in order. Once we got to the south entrance, the staff offered my parents a senior discount which amounted to an annual pass to all National Parks for $10. It takes about an hour to get to Yosemite Valley, but it's a scenic drive. After passing through a long tunnel, there is a vista area with an amazing view of Half Dome and the Valley. Lots of photo ops. We were a little surprised by the number of foreigners standing around smoking. The next stop we made was Bridalveil Fall. Since it was late summer, the fall was pretty weak. Next we stopped to see El Capitan. I had read about an easy hike to Mirror Lake, so we parked on the side of the road to pick up that trail. We were disappointed that the lake was dried up--it's definitely better to visit in the spring if you want to see seasonal lakes and falls. We packed our own lunch and ate at a picnic area. You can rent bikes or horses. There is a museum, campgrounds, and places to eat, but we didn't do any of that. We didn't bother stopping by Yosemite Falls since we figured they were dried up too. We spent about 5 hours inside the park, but you could really spend days or weeks there.","September 13, 2013",Gorgeous views,143,"Coalinga, California",5

So that there wont be much crowd and Weather will be better (Depending on the severity of winter on that year) and moreover you will have lengthier daylight time.-> All the water falls will be roaring with plenty of water..its a feast to watch them.We visited on the mid of the week. So less crowd everywhere. We got parking on all the places in the valley. Plenty of time take pictures and to relax near every beautiful spot.Carry a sweater or a jacket.

Yosemite Valley,"Absolutely beautiful place. Great for everything - hiking, biking, photography, etc. The first time I came was in May a few years ago. We climbed Yosemite Falls, which was quite an ascent but wasn't especially difficult. We then stayed for one night in a campground outside the park. Boy was I surprised to see it snowing the next morning! Seeing snow fall on the Merced River is very beautiful.I also came more recently, staying for two nights in Curry Village. Do note that summer is probably the worst time to visit, since many of the falls are dried up and the skies are often cloudless (this is mostly relevant to photographers). However, I was able to get some good shots along a hidden treasure of Yosemite National Park: the Tioga Road. Most people stay in the Yosemite Valley area, but definitely a good idea to venture out to places like Hetch Hetchy, Glacier Point, and the eastern border. The closest stretch of the Tioga Road is just some winding across the forested Sierras, but nearing the end you get amazing views of several lakes, including Tenaya Lake, which are just beautiful against the backdrop of the mountains.","September 11, 2013",Its a Beauty,0,"Dallas, Texas",4

From the falls, to the roads up to the highest elevation (we saw SNOW on the ground in July!), the wildlife (we saw a baby bear) and the vast meadows further into the park (this is where many of the people who work at the park spend their day off-so you know it's good), you really want to give yourself time to really take in all of the splendor surrounding you.

Yosemite Valley,"We arrived in Yosemite in late August amidst news of a huge forest fire which had already burnt 100 000 acres. Naturally we were only too pleased when were admitted into the National Park and there was no sign of smoke.There were spectacular views in some places - very similar to the Lake District or as someone from our tour mentioned, Canada.I however, wanted to see the 2 main attractions, the Yosemite Falls and the biggest Giant Sequoia. The road from Mammoth Lakes in the south, lined by pine and sequoia, wound through the mountains and then sloped down into Yosemite valley where the Falls was located. That was where the disappointments began.The tallest waterfall in USA had dried up, leaving a white cleft in the cliff face. A thin wet patch was all that remained in the lower falls - nothing like the popular postcard picture of the falls.The Giant Sequoia? - Well, that was ""in another part"" of the National Park - inaccesible except through the side roads i.e. you have to drive there yourself.So, do visit the park but NOT in August where you have to pay to enter and not be able to view the best 2 attractions.","September 4, 2013",Very Good but ...,19,"London, United Kingdom",4

Yosemite Valley,"This valley is breathtaking. You can not fully comprehend the magnitude of the scenery until you've been there. When we first came into the Valley we stopped at the first waterfall we came upon. We attempted to walk up to it but the fall was coming down so hard off the mountain it was like standing in a major storm. It was mid-June but it had been a particularly snowing winter so the falls were coming down in torrents. We were soaked through our clothes without getting within 100 yards of where it cascaded down! We continued further into the park and were met by the El Capitan (pardon any spelling issues!) and the half dome. We once again found a spot and took pictures as the Yosemite falls cascaded in the background. We walked through the valley marveling at the all. We then drove out of the Valley and up to Glacier Point.....do not miss doing this! As your car climbs up the temperature lowers and lowers. Where it was 90 in the valley, the top of the point was in the 60s. The view is fantastic. The wildlife unreal - two bear, coyote, and a few other smaller creatures presented themselves.

We made a loop of the valley before heading back and grabbing some swimwear to take a dip in one of the swimming holes to cool off. Then we pedaled around for a little while longer before deciding to return the bikes as it was 3pm and the heat was pretty tiring (96F). The valley is an amazing place and it's easy to see why it's so crowded in the summer. It's a must see but try doing it by bike instead of driving around in your car.

Yosemite Valley,"Ee had just one day in the park see and experience it. Having read a little about being on the park for a day we followed the advice of others and parked the car, took our lunch pack with us and jumped on the shuttle buses. The Visitor Center, Museums and Gift Shops were very nice. The shuttle will get you around to them all with regular scheduled efficientcy. The other shuttle will take you out to the main attractions like El Capitan and Half Dome. There are tours you can pay for that are private and ranger led. These can get expensive for a family of four. We chose the free shuttle and took lots of pictures at the different drop off locations. All shuttles return to or near the main parking lot. During our week in the parks we ate our lunches al fresco and enjoyed the natural wonders surrounding us. The weather was very nice here at the higher elevations. Plenty of picnic tables.","August 18, 2013",A Day in the Park,25,"Clearwater, Florida",5

Yosemite Valley,"One could easily argue that this is the most beautiful place in the US (I have been to all 50 states). Great waterfalls in the spring. Steep deep canyon walls with famous cliffs and domes. Great scenery .Fantastic hikes and peacefull walks.. Swimming, biking and lots to do. It can be croswded during the summer with much auto traffic and pedestrians near visitor center; and also crawded a the Yosemite lodge. The free shuttle bus is freqeunt and really helps with the congestion and moving people about.Environmentalists and tourists have different perspectives aout the valley and what should be done.

Once you've seen a few of the Sequoias - you've probably seen them all. It was hard to get the kids inspired for Vernal Falls and Nevada Falls the next day. We made it to Vernal but would have had a revolt on our hands if we pushed it to Nevada Falls. Absolutely beautiful.

Yosemite Valley,"We were told that after noon, parking would be difficult, so we arrived at 10am from San Francisco and there was no traffic. Parking was easy and quick ($20/car) and a 10 minute walk to the Village. When we first drove into the park, we were struck with the beauty and vastness of the mountains. We were looking forward to walking around and taking loads of photos.At the Village, we spoke with a park agent, got our trail maps, and identified the 13 mile trail (Valley Floor Loop) we wanted to walk. We were told that it was kind of difficult to find (this is a national park which such high level of tourist, so I couldn't believe this) and that the trail wasn't too well marked. That was an understatement. After finally finding the right path, we soon discovered that the trail took you right alongside the road with all the cars whizzing by - definitely not a good experience for those wanting to escape to nature. There were barely any sign posts, no places to stock up on water along the trail and the few bathrooms reeked before you even entered them. As we were walking, we discovered that our trail had been closed (shouldn't the park ranger have known this and advised us accordingly when she was telling us about the trail?) and we had to walk on the very busy road alongside the cars. We kept on walking because we thought ""it has to get better than this"". Nope. When our pedometer marked 13 miles and we thought we were ""nearly there"", we were still at least another 1.5 miles away. We decided to jump on a free shuttle which came every 30 minutes and made our way back to the village.If you are coming to the Yosemite Valley, skip the Valley Floor Loop and try another trail. Maybe the other ones are better marked. Or, drive through it, stopping along the way to take pictures.","August 7, 2013",Poorly marked trails alongside road,16,"Westport, Connecticut",2

There are places to eat, order sandwiches for a picnic, use a restroom, learn about the history of Yosemite and gift stores.

This section of the park has a very small and old visitor's center, you catch a special shuttle just to get to it and the driving is a bit chaotic what with one way roads, busy intersections and such. If you plan to drive around the valley, become very familiar with the map. We found this area to be one of the worst areas of any national park we have visited for signage and such.

Shuttles are free. Make sure you know what you want to see because the park is huge and there are many places to cover. If you have less time like I did, pick the ones closer by and try to see as many as possible. Just hiking around the valley for couple hours is also a great way of spending your quality time.

Yosemite Valley,"I did not intentionally try to gather so much information in one stay, but stuff happens. The first and most important thing I learned and want to stress is triple check your reservations-even call and have a name just in case. Though mine was confirmed 3 mos in advance, changing one thing a week before and seeing the change on the computer screen did not mean it was confirmed. Initially we lost our first-night deposit and were fortunate the Ahwahnee Front Desk found us a place to stay outside the park when everything was sold out. Ultimately we ended up staying in a different hotel each night and came away with three entirely different perspectives on lodging there. This is what I learned on my 3-day Yosemite vacation:July is obviously a busy month, but the number of people milling through the park on foot, on bikes or on busses was a little disturbing. Just too many, and if a less crowded time is available, go for it. If you feel spiritually humbled by the surroundings, you may also experience a sense of stewardship and responsibility, which makes one protective. I think everyone should experience this place, but someone really should be monitoring the number of people- specifically tour busses- on any given day. If this is more than a day trip, you have 3 extreme choices for spending the night in the park: The iconic Ahwahnee, the Yosemite Lodge or camping. I will not comment on the camping since I did not experience it, but I will say the facilities looked very crowded. That said, fully experiencing nature in this spectacular place has to be a life memory. Our first night was spent outside the park at the sold out Yosemite View Lodge. It was actually very nice- our last minute reservation looked like a bridal suite with the jacuzzi in the bedroom. I have nothing bad to say; in fact, the rushing river behind the building is beautiful to listen to. Just be advised that although you are right outside the park in El Portal, you have a half hour drive in/out without traffic, and at night it can be a bit challenging. Advised the traffic starts early, we checked out without breakfast and half hour later were back at the Ahwahnee hoping for a cancellation. Be advised check-in is at 5pm, so if you get there early you will have no hotel facilities to use or place to relax. they did let us leave our car and possessions parked there while we shuttled it during the day. A 5 pm we returned to find out no cancellations, but they helped us get a room at the sold out Yosemite Lodge for night #2. I really don't know how to review this facility because it is the extremes of both good and bad. First the good- it is centrally located and affordable. You can eat in the food court or wait for the no reservations dining room. There are refrigerators in the rooms, but within 5 minutes of getting here, the bear warnings make a stick of gum seem too dangerous to leave in the car. The bad- it is big, busy and noisy; with rooms scattered among many separate buildings, most of which are old and seriously abused. We were first offered a first floor room that had open animal burrows surrounding the front door and the front/back doors were old with large gaps underneath. There is no air conditioning, and first floor rooms are considered good because they are cooler than the second floor. We opted to wait for a second floor and got a newly renovated room (available after 5 pm) which was much nicer but further away from the main building, pool and food facilities. The main building is a very crowded area with group and activity tour busses dropping/picking up groups all day and the food court in constant use. The activity and bustle seemed out of place in this magnificent park. The employees were all very nice, but as far as the facility, I would not stay here again. after 11 am check out we were again ""homeless"" and returned to the Ahwahnee looking for help again. Even though the front desk did help us find places to stay the first two nights, we had to pack up everything each morning and roam around the park not know where we would spend the night and it overshadowed the enjoyment of the day. it really did ruin a special trip planned (and saved for) months before. A fortunate conversation secured us a room there for the last night, which saved us from losing our deposit entirely. The Ahwahnee would be considered a beautiful iconic hotel anywhere, but inside the park- compared to the alternatives-, it was a completely different level of service. The food, service and facilities are excellent and the air conditioned rooms feel more luxurious than they really are. This cost is not for everyone, and I would be hard pressed to imagine returning with a family, but the memory of sitting in the Adirondack chairs watching the stars with a drink is a forever keeper. While there we hiked and biked, had a picnic lunch beside an icy cold stream with our feet in the water, gazed at more stars than imaginable, and without our phones remembered what quiet is. I would also recommend the Starry Night Tour which took us to Glacier Pt. at sundown and we learned a little astronomy/astrology/mythology. Go, but just watch out for bears and people.","August 1, 2013","humbling, but beware of the humans",60,"Long Island, NY",5
Yosemite Valley,"Of course the traffic and the crowds can be a drawback, but you have to go there to get to most of the trailheads for the big hikes and sites worth seeing.

Yosemite Valley,"This was my 1st trip to Yosemite - mid July. Didn't know what to see or where to go before coming here so I'll help break it down for you. Entrance fee - $20 per car (good for 7 days). We didn't have to pay it b/c on our way in, their credit card machine wasn't working (ranger told us to pay on our way out) and we drove out via south entrance where there is a separate exit road.If driving into east entrance as we've done, know that Tioga Rd/120 is closed in the winter (Nov-May) - check NPS website beforehand. On Tioga Pass (just after you enter), you can fill up on gas ($4.75/gallon) before heading into the rest of the park, have lunch (there's a grill/sandwich place), buy ice, and stretch your legs on the outdoor patio. Elevation here is 9945 ft. Then you'll hit Tuolumne campground, store, visitor center. Elevation here is 8600 ft. Sites are $20/night - half are FCFS. It's 1.5hr from Yosemite valley. There is potable water here. Way too many people here in my opinion due to the number of sites. There is a yummy fast-food grill place at the Tuolumne store. They also serve soft ice cream!As you head further in, stop by Tenaya Lake - absolutely breathtaking. HUGE lake with plenty of beach and shoreline to sunbathe. Yes you can swim in it, kayak, raft, etc- so bring your swimsuit, kayak/canoe, rafts. It's literally right next to the road however. I believe there is a hiking loop around the massive lake. Next stop is Olmstead Point to take photos. You can even hike up the boulders across the street.Yosemite valley is about 1.5hr from Tuolumne. The road has 2 lanes (one going the other way), windy but very well paved. Ranger police do patrol the park so don't speed. We witnessed a car being chased for speeding. Tuolumne grove is the next touristy spot but I'd skip it. It only has a few scattered sequoia trees. It is a short hike (~2 miles RT) however. The only highlight of this hike is the famous sequoia tunnel tree (google to see pictures).Once you head into the valley, you can pull into viewpoint areas to take photos of a distant Half Dome and valley, Merced River. Crane Flat has a store and the only other gas station in the park. The valley is one big elongated loop. Southside Drive takes you in and Northside Drive takes you out. Curry Village is at the end of the loop. One of the first stops into the valley is Bridalveil Falls (it was pretty bone dry in mid-July) - short hike in. Best to come in late spring for hearty waterfall action.Then you'll see Cathedral Rocks and Spires on your left so stop and take pictures. El Capitan - the biggest chunk of granite there is - is to way to your left as you drive in. The best way to see El Capitan is from El Capitan Meadow which is on Northside Drive. There is also a hiking trail into El Capitan off of Southside drive. We've touched it and stood right below it. We even saw a climbing rope on it. The best view of Half dome is from Ahwahnee Meadows (near Ahwanhee Hotel). You can park on Northside or Southside roads. Best light for pics for Half Dome is late afternoon or early evening. We found the light to be a challenge due to a constant haze over the valley in the morning. There is a 16-mile hike to Half dome for which you have to apply for a permit way in advance. There is a cable staircase up the rounded part of the dome. Go to recreation.gov for more info. It will take ~9hrs to do hike (we couldn't do it b/c we didn't have a permit).Hike into Mirror Lake - 2.3 mile hike (RT). The lake was half empty in mid-July but you can still swim, sit on your raft, and relax on the beach. You can bike in - most people did. You can rent recreational equipment (raft, bike, etc) at Curry Village Recreation or Yosemite Lodge. On the way in/out, there are nice sandy beach areas along the Merced River to relax in. There is a profile view of Half Dome at Mirror Lake.Yosemite Valley is the busiest spot in the park - packed with tourists (not as bad as Yellowstone though). Curry Village is second. Yos valley has a large store (very $$$- $8.99 firewood, $10.50 for 20# ice bag, packaged sandwiches $7), grill, cafe/deli (Degnan's), pizzeria, museum, Ansel Adams gallery, visitor center. The store has everything you need even gifts/souvenirs. No gas station inside valley. Our fave spot was Curry Village. It was much smaller in scale and a bit cheaper. It has a grill (serve gluten-free bread), pizza, cafeteria, coffee bar (real cappuccino machine), ice cream parlor inside coffee bar, wifi lounge, shower facility, general store, gear shop. It has lodging - many canvas tent cabins with cots in them (starts at $118/night). The showers were great - around 11 stalls or so. It has lockers, electric outlets. $5 (cash only) gives you unlimited shower time! Towels are provided. Showers are free for Curry Village campers. The only other shower facility is at Housekeeping camp. I don't recommend it - it is one skanky, dirty camp. The tents look like beaten down shantys. The only redeeming quality of Housekeeping camp is the direct beach/river access.Stop by the Swinging Bridge (not a real swinging bridge at all) and relax on the beach of the Merced River and glide down the river on your floatie. Sentinel Beach also offers the same experience although less popular than Swinging Bridge. We saw many people stop along the roads to hang out by the river. I have never seen a river that has this much shoreline. The river is also quite wide and relatively calm in the summer.Tunnel View- From here you can see El Capitan and Bridalveil Fall, with Half Dome in the background. This viewpoint is at the east end of the Wawona Tunnel along the Wawona Road (Highway 41). Glacier Point - another main attraction. It provides you with an entire view of the valley. You only see a profile shot of Half Dome. It's a 45-min drive from the valley. There is a hike up there.Mariposa Grove - can't really comment since we couldn't get in due to our dog (pets not allowed on shuttle buses). Both parking lots were full so they turned us around to Wawona village for the shuttle. This occurred at 9:30am on a Saturday and 10:30am on a Friday. If you've been to Sequoia Nat'l Park, you can skip this as this is on a much smaller scale. It is about 45 min from the valley. There is a 100% reservable campground in Wawona as well as a gas station, golf course, lodging, store.Shuttle buses - free throughout park. No pets. You can pick up a shuttle route at the visitor's center. They go to Tuolumne, village area, Wawona.WiFi- free at Curry village. Cell svc is spotty around the village- best at Curry Village.Pets - leave them at home if this is your 1st time. They're only allowed on paved bike paths - you can take them to Mirror Lake, Bridalveil Falls, Yosemite Falls. Our dog severely limited our hiking experience. We couldn't do the trails into vernal and nevada falls which were the only ones that were flowing to name a few. In the summer, you couldn't leave your dog in your car very long. Temperatures in village can reach high 90s. We had the a/c on in the car the whole time we were in the village area. Pets are allowed in most campgrounds except Camp 4. They are not allowed on shuttle buses.South entrance into/out of park: If you're coming from due west like us, do not come in this way. It's much longer (by several hours), and slower than coming into the east entrance via 120. You'll also experience traffic through Vegas. 120 is a much straighter shot but with less gas stations along the way.Campgrounds: Tamarack Flat is the best - 100% FCFS, sites farthest apart, woody, pets allowed, 35 min from the valley. Cons: no RVs allowed, no potable water, 3 miles off Tioga Rd/120 (last mile while paved is full of potholes and very windy). Porcupine flat (100% FCFS) up farther east on Tioga Rd (1hr from valley) - sites very close together, no potable water, creek access, pets allowed. Crane Flat - skip it - 99% of sites are slanted on a hill! Camp 4 - mostly rock climbers, walk-in tent sites only, very close together. Upper & Lower Pine campgrounds while inside the valley, were crowded, skanky, with sites every close together. White wolf creek supposedly has bears wandering around there. Don't know much about Yosemite creek campground except it rec'd bad reviews mainly due to the terrible 3 mile road to the camp. if you want more info on how to secure a FCFS site, go to ""Tamarack Flat Campground"" reviews and read my review.4-7 days is enough to see the park for first-timers. Plan to drive A LOT and spend $$ on gas at the expensive gas stations (Tuolumne area, Wawona, Crane Flat) ! If you want to save some $$, plan on not bringing a cooler. We wound up eating at the villages for lunch and dinner anyway. Bring filtered water if you're planning on staying at the FCFS campgrounds. They accept US $ or checks for camping fees.

Yosemite Valley,"This was my second visit to Yosemite and this felt like a whole new experience. Of course the last trip was 15 years ago, but I still had a blast. If you like to drive, this is the place for you. Make sure you have a nice vehicle because the mountain roads are challenging! I was fortunate enough to rent a Nissan Maxima with a very sporty suspension. It was perfect for zipping thru Yosemite. I should also mention, just getting to Yosemite involves miles of mountain driving with plenty of twisties and steep hills for you enthusiasts. I really felt like I was on my personal roller coaster! My wife and 2 boys probably had less fun as passengers :)Back to Yosemite! Everywhere you look there are beautiful sights and things to see. Mountains, valleys, huge boulders, massive trees, waterfalls, streams to float or wade in. We only visited for a day, but felt like we saw a good portion of the park. Obviously, the longer you stay the more you can see. We did not see any bears, but we heard they were spotted in the camps. We did see random deer roaming around. Several squirrels and birds. It was very warm the day we visited, so a cooler is recommended. Food choices in the park are limited, so plan ahead. We waited in line at the deli for about 30 mins :(Tip - Be sure to bring some Germex or some other sanitizer, baby or wet wipes would be good too. The bathrooms we visited were nothing short of disgusting!!Given the opportunity, I would visit again so I HIGHLY recommend a visit to anyone!","July 29, 2013",Awesome! A must see location in N.

Yosemite Valley,"Just back from Yosemite National Park! Suggest that you DO NOT miss the drive to Glacier Point as it was the most breathtaking spot to see Half Dome and the two of three flowing waterfalls during summer. We didn't make it to the scenic drive to Tulolumne Meadows because we spent the day trying to work our way through Yosemite Valley. What a madhouse!! Wasted time walking to Mirror Lake when it was dried up (we should have known) and although the movie at the Visitor's Center was ok, we now suggest that you should spend your day as far away from Yosemite Valley as you can. Just too crazy busy with about 10,000 campers and bikes everywhere. Yuck.","July 29, 2013","Skip the Valley, Get to the Point",27,"Saint Louis, Missouri",4
Yosemite Valley,"One of the most beautiful places in America but beware; it is commercialised. Nevertheless, it's very suited to the day visitor with turnouts from which photos can be taken and a free shuttle bus service which takes you to the start of various trails, many of which are suitable for children. There are many interesting layers if you intend on a longer visit and wish to adventure off the beaten track. For those who have an interest in rock climbing or hiking, there is no better. Essentially, a visit to Yosemite is an absolute must for anyone's ""to do"" list. ","July 28, 2013",Stunning,2,"Norwich, United Kingdom",5

Yosemite Valley,"We visited Yosemite to celebrate my birthday. We stayed in a vacation rental by owner property in Oakhurst, about 6 miles out of the south entrance of the park. The property can be found at VRBO site #180676. Their ""cabin"" was actually a one bedroom home nestled in the woods. There is a little creek in front that in summer provides a little babble. The home is well appointed and the kitchen is nicer than mine at home. It had everything you could imagine, including the spices we needed for grilling dinner. It was quite warm during our stay, 97 degrees but the house is kept cool by a swamp cooler. The hosts have lots of books and maps for the area and Rick stopped by with a few suggestions as well. It is a peaceful Mecca after a day of hiking in the park which is crowded at times. But don't let the crowds near the entrance scare you off. Travel to Glacier point and hike toward the valley floor and the less serious hikers drop off. The scenery is spectacular and worth the little challenge of the hike. There are several waterfalls that can be seen from here as well as half dome. A peaceful experience even though we saw a bear crossing the stream at the valley floor","July 28, 2013",What makes California great,71,"La Mesa, California",5
Yosemite Valley,"Staying here would be a central point for all the main attractions no doubt. But make no mistake, the consequences of that would be overcrowding with nowhere decent to park.

Yosemite Valley,"When we visited Yosemite in July I was actually a bit disappointed. This is a pity because Yosemite beyond doubt is a true gem of a place. Much of my disappointment was due to my own mistakes during planning. We had scheduled a full day for exploring Yosemite Valley – but that is simply not enough. Staying for two nights in the area and having a full day to explore had been adequate at Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, Bryce Canyon and Sequoia – but if you want to do justice to Yosemite and get a closer look at more than two or three of the most significant sights in this dream of a place you must plan to stay longer. You will need at least two full days.Also, in order not to lose precious time on transport to and from the valley I strongly recommend staying inside the park – even if rooms in Yosemite Valley are either more expensive or less luxurious than accommodation outside the park. For our visit in July we stayed two nights at the Tenaya Lodge in Fish Camp just outside the south gate to the park. The Tenaya Lodge is a very nice hotel – but it is located a full hour’s drive from the valley along a winding mountain road. This is too far away. Compared to the sights in the valley the road is boring – and you will lose two hours per day on transport alone. Coming into the valley the Valley View at the west end is a great lookout. During our day in the park we did three shorter hikes – towards Vernal Fall, to Mirror Lake and to the bottom of the Lower Yosemite Fall. There was no time for Glacier Point or other and possibly more impressive hikes. On our way back to the hotel in Fish Camp we made a stop also at the Mariposa Grove just inside the gate to the park. The Mariposa is a grove of giant Sequoias, very impressive if it’s the first time you see trees this size – and definitely a must see if you do not have time to visit the much larger Sequoia National Park in the Sierras three hours south of Yosemite.","July 25, 2013",One day is not enough,175,"Aarhus, Denmark",5
Yosemite Valley,"This must be the worst and saddest part of the entire park. We left after 20 minutes.

Here we are, in this mind boggling scenery, and we have 'Rawhide' blaring out of the cab, and are being encouraged to stick our hands out and join in with disco music.Amidst all this gorgeous, million-year-old scenery, could we not just have a bit of peace and quiet to enjoy it?","July 24, 2013",A must-see,48,"London, United Kingdom",5
Yosemite Valley,"Even with peak crowds over the summer Yosemite does not disappoint. Hiking, horseback riding, rafting and driving to remote vistas are all ways to soak in this place. Going early helps avoid the crowds and hiking just a mile or so off the main attractions will result in your own slice of nature. Junior ranger program for ths kids and getting a good map with trails to hike will make a positive difference.We explored the southern area as we were staying at Tenaya Lodge. Yosemite Valley is easy striking distance from there. Mariposa Grove is less than 10min drive from the hotel. Fly in to Fresno and the drive up is about 1 hour.Bring your camera and see the vallet from both the floor and from Glacier Point (summer) and take care to bring patience and wait for good sunlight.","July 23, 2013",National treasure that must be seen,167,"Doha, Qatar",5

Yosemite falls was great ... but I have heard that it is even more spectacular in the spring from the mountain snow melt. It wasn't too busy when we were there, but I could imagine that there are times when traffic is backed up. Be prepared for very winding roads going into and out of the canyon. We did not stay overnight at any of the campgrounds or hotel so we cannot comment on that.

Yosemite Valley,"We visited Yosemite at the beginning of August and considering it was the first time I had ever been to the park I was amazed and awed by the beautiful views. However, it became clear right away that summer is the absolute WORST time to visit! I know its a popular National Park, but the amount of people there was insane. The park roads are full of traffic, visitor center's parking lots are full (We had to park on the side of the road a good half mile away from one), and the people make it hard to enjoy the nature.Its definitely a place worth seeing, and I would love to go back - just not in the summer! If you love nature you'll love Yosemite. Its truly one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. I would just like to experience that beauty without being surrounded by hundreds of people!It seems like it should be a place worthy of a 5 star review, but unfortunately my own experience only warrants 3 stars.

We saw deer, bears, snakes, rabbits, etc...while neighbors of ours saw a wolf up on Glacier Point! (wish we'd been up there!) Upper Yos. Falls is the highest waterfall in the US and Nevada falls was just awesome.

It's just jaw droppingly scenic to the point of feeling almost surreal. One can do as much or as little as you wish there but my advice, for a family with kids, who have only one day there, would be;- park at the car park just entering Yosemite village and use the free shuttle bus from there- visit the museum and welcome centre in Yosemite village( the video presentation is great)- walk to the Lower Falls- view The Bridalveil falls-have a splash around in one of the streams- see the Yosemite Valley from the Tunnel View.....totally awesome!- view the half dome.

Yosemite Valley,"It really is amazing. I would camp for a day or two on the valley floor, then go somewhere else within Yosemite. If you are staying outside the park, leave early (before 7) and get parking. During high season, by 11am, it is super crowded and ridiculous. The entrances also get really backed up (we saw it 2 miles long on the Saturday after 4th of July). Entrance to the park is a one time fee for a week pass.We stayed about 3 miles from the south entrance along the 41 in Fish Camp- which we loved. It still took us about 45 minutes to the Valley Floor. However, if you enter on the south entrance you pass Glacier Point and Tunnel View on your way to the floor. Also, the Mariposa Grove is also accessed via south entrance.Parking- Park either in the general parking by Yosemite Village or in Curry Village. - Curry Village has bike and raft rentals. - Shuttles run regularly throughout the park. Yosemite Village and Yosemite Lodge are close together, whereas Camp Curry is further away.Easy Hikes- Yosemite Falls is a pretty easy hike and close by Yosemite Lodge.Bike Rentals- Bike Rentals located at either Yosemite Lodge or Curry Village. Curry Village is more crowded, but does have raft rentals for floating down the river.- This is a must to see the whole valley floor. It takes about 2 hours to bike all the way around.- Stop at Mirror Lake on the bike trail and check it out.- Bike rentals are $11 an hour or $34 for the whole day. They also have kid bike trailers available. Again, paths get crowded in the afternoon.Tips- Grab a map and plan out your day. Things aren't always marked well, so make sure you know where you are going (on bikes and hiking).- Stop at Tunnel View on your way in/out or even Glacier Point if coming in on the 41.- We didn't see that many places to eat that were nicer than anything we brought in with us. - There is a Vons in Oakhurst about 15 miles from the south entrance. It is a great place to stop for all the necessities.- There are a lot of great cabin rentals on VRBO outside the park entrance.","July 14, 2013",Get in early during high season!!!,88,"Huntington Beach, California",4
Yosemite Valley,"We only had one day to spend in the park and as we stayed outside the park the night before, we arrived around 10 in the morning. We were advised to discover the park in the following order, and indeed it was fantastic. We arrived via Highway 140 and followed El portal Road up toward Bridalveil Fall, viewpoint #1. Already from the begining it was amazing, the views are spectacular and to add to the excitement, as we drove in the park we spotted a brown bear in a field, what a bonus ! The second stop was Washburn point, with an amazing view over Sentinel Dome. We then drove to Glacier point (viewpoint#3) where we spent a bit of time walking around and taking lots of photos. There was also a little cafe and souvenir shop. We decided before leaving the park to go to the village down in the valley however that was not really worth it to our liking. the views are much more spectacular from above and if like us you can only spare 6 to 8 hrs in the park it is much better driving up to those viewpoints. Our last view point was on our way out, Tunnel view. The park is absolutatly amazing, even for non-walkers like us, it was just the best.

The weather varied from cool and rainy and chilly in the AM to very warm and steamy by the end of the day, so be prepared with layers. We used the free park shuttles to get everywhere and enjoyed the convenience and air conditioning. Depending on the time of day, they could be standing room only but it varied by time of day. We also took an open air shuttle tour around the valley with a ranger and learned more about the geology. We had cooking facilities but were joined by another family who stayed in Curry Village and did not have access. They had showers and a pool, we just had a bathroom and nice site at Lower Pines campground. We ate dinner one night at the outdoor pizza place at Curry and also had icecream there one night. We all enjoyed the food and found it to be reasonably priced. We also shopped for some items in the store and found their prices fair as well. (smores kit). We did see Yosemite visitors center and enjoyed our time there too. The traffic was heavy but not insane but it was the week before the 4th.

If you plan any serious hiking hit the trails by 7 or you will spend your entire climb and descent shuffling behind families with children straggling in every direction. If you’re a camper, and love the solitude of the woods, this is not going to be what you find in Yosemite Valley, even on non-holiday weekends, except perhaps in October when it is getting cold at night.Winter here is a delight and you can snowshoe or cross country ski in the valley and be amazed by the quality of light and the dramatic scenery.It’s unfortunate the National Park Service has not done what they did for Zion by limiting cars and replacing them with busses from central parking lots.

Yosemite Valley,"Having visited Yosemite Valley over 100 times, I can simply say, it never gets old. There is an incredible energy, a magnificence that helps restore the frayed soul and inspire the creative mind. Ansel Adam rightfully called it a part of the ""range of light"" - there are some days, when a whisper of moisture is in the air, that everything seems to glow in the sunlight, the 3000+ foot cliffs are chiseled with light and shadow, and you have to swallow away tears of sheer enjoyment. It's not just the ""famous"" spots - El Capitan, Bridal Veil Fall, Mirror Lake, that entrance, but the small as well. Fern Springs, just a bit bigger than a serving platter, the only fall not to go dry each year. Scarlet snow plants that stick out like tropical flowers that somehow took a wrong turn. The coyote hunting in the snow, for all the world looking like a demented jack in the box. To me, Yosemite is one of the few national parks that you can visit numerous times (and I've been to many), and always find new wonder - within and without. - Author Claudia Newcorn","July 6, 2013",It never gets old,42,"Modesto, California, United States",5

All in all it was a pleasant enough day out but I regretted spending 8 hours in a car (4 hrs there and back) to see a pretty ordinary park. I wasted a day in my opinion when I could have done more in San Francisco itself. Don't go with kids.. they will be bored out of their minds...

The meadows were beautiful with streams, meadows , pine trees and the snow covered Cathedral range. Plenty of hikes to do here. MAGNIFICENT.

Yosemite Valley,"We spent 3 days/4 nights in Yosemite & it was amazing! Everyone needs to see Yosemite at least once in their life time.We arrived to Yosemite in the late afternoon on Memorial Day and I was SHOCKED at how crowed the park still was. It made me so happy that we were going to be in the park Tuesday, Wednesday & Thursday when less people would be there.We stayed in a condo in Yosemite West that was about 16 miles from the Valley. It wasn't the nicest place but it was much cheaper (for what you got) than staying in the Valley & had it's own kitchen, which was nice.Day one we took a one way bus (booked in advance online) to Glacier Point & hiked the Panorama Trail (& John Muir Trail) back down to the Valley. It was an amazing hike! So if you're up for a 10 mile hike (it's not 8 miles like the sign says, I had a Garmin watch on), mostly down hill, you should definitely do this one. The views from Glacier Point are unbelievable.Day two we drove Tioga Pass over to the Tuolumne Meadows & all the way to Lee Vining. It takes an entire day since just getting to that part of the park is at least 3 hours round trip but the drive is totally worth it. This part of the park looks so different than the Valley, it's almost like being in a different park. And it's at a much higher elevation so there was still snow at the end of May.Day tree we hiked Mist Trail up to Nevada Falls & took the John Muir trial back down. I think it was a little over 8 miles round trip. The Mist Trail is a really cool trail going up but I can't imagine taking it back down. There are tons of wet granite steps that aren't very wide so if you were going against traffic it could get scary. I actually thought the 'stairs' were easier on the Mist Trail than the 'slopes' on the Mist Trail. We started the hike really early, 5:30 a.m., to be able to beat most crowds & give ourselves the entire day to enjoy the park. We spent at least an hour at Nevada Falls having lunch & just taking in the view.","July 2, 2013",Amazing Trip!,499,"Dallas, Texas",5
Yosemite Valley,"We visited June 26 and 27. The first day we explored Yosemite Valley with the thousands of other people there on a summer Wednesday. The falls were beautiful and the hike up the Mist Trail crowded, but congenial. We drove out to Glacier Point at sunset and it was spectacular. But the best part of our whole trip was the tour John Kleinfelter led us on the next day from Tuolomne Meadows. John, of Yosemite Guide Service, took us off the beaten path so that we could enjoy the immensity of the place with equally spectacular vistas in solitude! Five stars for a tour with John Kleinfelter.","July 2, 2013",Yosemite Guide Service,0,"Arlington, Virginia",4

Do your research on accommodation as we were only given very expensive choices and declined but I saw many more options once i was there.

There was a wildfire burning just outside the park and outside of Mariposa, CA were we stayed. We stayed at the Best Western Yosemite Way Station motel which was acceptable. Request a room on the back side of the motel to cut down on the noise from the road. The pool looked okay but we didn't swim. The breakfast was pretty good warm and cold eats. Due to our limited time we decided to do a tour of the park. We ended up choosing Discover Yosemite all day tour with guide Steve. That was a great way to see most of the main attractions of Yosemite. The roads are so curvy that it would have been hard to drive and see things and we would have missed a lot of stuff.

Yosemite Valley,"In many ways I can't believe I just ranked Yosemite Valley, one of the most amazingly beautiful places on God's Green Earth, with less than the full five stars, but I'm trying to be honest here. I grew up in the eastern US and have literally dreamed my entire life of seeing Yosemite Valley. My family is a semi-outdoorsy bunch. We like camping and hiking but aren't hardcore types who go on weeklong backpacking trips or anything. We just returned from a western trek which took us to five national parks (Yosemite, Kings Canyon, Sequoia, Grand Canyon, Petrified Forest), and Yosemite was the one we most looked forward to and budgeted the most time for. When we drove into the valley, I literally got tears in my eyes at my first view of it. After only having seen it in pictures, the panorama of the valley opening up before me, framed by El Capitan on my left and Half Dome on my right, literally got me all choked up. Yosemite Valley truly is one of the most beautiful places on earth, and is certainly one of the most amazing places any of us had ever seen.So why am I not giving it the full 5 stars? It's sort of hard to explain, but every member of my family of four, while incredibly moved by the valley's beauty, found the overall experience of being there vaguely unsatisfying. Perhaps it was because we so looked forward to it that it had to be something of a letdown. Maybe it was some bad karma caused by the unpleasant past regarding the dispossession of the native peoples (that was my husband's theory--he said he kind of had the heebie-jeebies the whole time he was there thinking about how the whole valley was once the home of the Miwok people). Could it have been the intimidating layout of the valley which has you walking around on the valley floor while surrounded by towering walls of sheer granite? Or, as is most likely, is it the presence of tons and tons of other tourists kind of ruining the whole ""back to nature"" vibe? While I'm glad that Yosemite has been preserved by the government for the enjoyment of everyone, I just wish everyone wasn't there at the same time I was! The atmosphere in parts of the valley feels a bit like being in Disney World. You have to deal with parking, shuttle buses, crowds, and the general discomfort of being one of a herd of tourists. We were in the middle of a long vacation that had tired all of us out much more than we would have expected, so we had no energy to do any remotely strenuous hikes, so we never got the experience I heard so many people talk about of getting up on a trail and getting away from the crowds to enjoy some peace and quiet. We had thought we might be able to do one loop trail near some falls until we realized that the beginning of the trail was over 2 miles away from the lot where we had to park our car. When we added the 4 mile round trip to the trail head to the hike we hoped to take, we were all just too pooped to consider it. So we just ambled about the valley floor and had a picnic along with a few thousand of our closest friends near the base of Yosemite Falls. We had planned to stay at Yosemite for 3 days, but after having been there a day and a half, we realized that if we weren't hiking we didn't need that much time. So, overall, Yosemite Valley is a place I think everyone should see at least once, but I must caution you that they do, resulting in crowds galore. The natural beauty of the place is almost religiously inspirational, but the crowds and accommodations for those crowds (roads, signs, hotels, trams, stores, etc.) take a little something away from the atmosphere. There is literally a good sized town in the valley, and I wasn't really expecting that or how it would diminish the experience so significantly for my whole family.","June 24, 2013",Stunning but extremely popular,91,Georgia,4

I have returned 4 times since then and always recommend Yosemite to friends who visit California.There is lots to do for the active people (trekking, swimming, canoeing, horse riding, climbing etc) and also for the less active (camping, hotels, eating places etc).

The day had a nice mix of quite time to sleep and witty banter with trivia and main ideas about the area. The stop at the fruit stand and the stop to get sandwitches help maximize time in the park. I picked this tour because it gave you the most amount of time in the park. There was time to actually take a hike in the park. There were also a few photo op stops as well. I was worried the trip wouldn't measure up to the cost of the trip, but it was well worth it.

As you head into the valley, you catch glimpses of the waterfalls and rock walls behind the trees. When you finally make it to some of the meadow areas, you are awestruck at the sheer vertical rock faces along both sides of you. It's no wonder that John Muir fell in love with the place.

Yosemite Valley,"I have to preface this by saying that I'm not an outdoorsy kind of gal. My husband was hellbent on going to Yosemite as the third leg of our CA trip: Napa, SFO, and then Yosemite. This seemed a bit much for me as it required 2 different rental cars, 3 different B & Bs, different clothes for 3 different destinations and climates, and lots of navigating on unmarked, curvy, California roads. By the time we got to Yosemite, you could easily say that I was not a happy camper. Neither one of use had ever been to a national park before. It took a full 2 hours of driving from Twain Harte to get to the Valley Floor. The roads are very curvy and mostly two lane. It's pretty easy to take a wrong turn and wind up somewhere in the wilderness. Once we got there, we decided that the best course of action was to take the tram for the two hour valley floor tour. That wound up being a good move. It cost $25.00 per person and was well worth it. The guide gave lots of information. We saw El Capitan and two waterfalls that were breathtaking. It was crowded with lots of people camping, fishing, climbing, hiking, and so on. It was lush and green and well cared for, but Yosemite doesn't have much color and no flowers. Lots of gray and brown and green. We ate lunch at the cafeteria near the Lodge. There's a really good gift shop next door with high quality items for sale. We took a wrong turn on the way back and went about 20 miles the wrong way. It took us 3 hours to get back to our B & B. Yosemite is no doubt a spectacular wonder of nature. It's pretty difficult to give it a less than stellar review given that God created it.

But sometimes you just have to manage your way through the crowds to see the sights you came to see, which are really cool!

Yosemite Valley,"Beautiful, breath taking views and surroundings, but the amount of people in this valley area of the park is crazy. We are hikers and outdoorsy people so this park was on the list to do, next time we are skipping the ""tourist stops"". If you go to the valley area of the park in June to see the major sights be prepared to be surrounded by people. You will need to drive to other areas of the park to hike or get away from civilization. Sorry but surrounded by people at every turn is not my idea of a National Park get away. The sights and the views are the only reason I am giving this a 4 star rating. We were also disappointed in the lack of signage for the trailheads. We followed a sign for the upper Falls trail head that took us 3 miles to another parking lot before we got to the trailhead. Would had been nice to know to just park the car at the trail head not walk 3 miles to a parking lot. Sorry Yosemite, we know you are beautiful but we will not be back.

There is also a shuttle bus which has frequent stops along the valley. The Valley Loop Floor walk is long but easy for those that fancy a gentle easing into hiking - it was about 13 miles and no ups or downs, you just follow the valley all around.

Yosemite Valley,"I booked a day trip on All San Francisco Tours that lasted from 0620 till 2100 leaving from S F with hotel pick up. This is a 410 mile round trip stopping off for breakfast on the way before entering the park around five hours later. The first highlight is a two mile round hike to the bottom of the valley to see the redwood trees and actually walk through one. You then follow the river Merced stopping off at photo points before you drop down to the valley floor to take in the Bridalveil falls that are the highest in America. You then head for the Lodge that offers accommodation if you book well in advance. I would recommend this if you want to see the full beauty of this park and the mountains. A day trip only does it part justice as there are villages along the way that are no doubt worth exploring if you have transport and the time. This park covers a vast area and the chances are you will be in a San Francisco hotel as I was. Time is your enemy on this type of visit, so think about what you want to see, either on a day trip or under your own steam.

Yosemite Valley,"It's hard to know where to begin - and stop. Let me start by making sure you don't make the mistake we almost made - leaving without making the effort to go out to Glacier Point. PLEASE do not miss this part of Yosemite!! We have visited nearly every major National Park in the West and the view from Glacier Point has to be the most spectacular sight we have seen. From that vantage, you're looking down at the entire valley floor 3000 feet below. You're also looking across at Half Dome and El Capitan just across the valley. All the major waterfalls and their sources are part of the scene, except for Bridal Veil, but you would likely have stopped to see this on your way to or from Glacier Point. You'll be surrounded by awesome snow-capped mountains in many directions. PLEASE DO NOT MISS GLACIER POINT!OK, enough with the caps already. Second to Glacier Point in my recommendations would be Mariposa Grove. Again, this takes a little effort - either driving to it or taking a tour bus from Yosemite Lodge. The giant Sequoias you will see there are breathtaking. They are the largest LIVING organisms on earth (not counting a French fungus) and the experience of moving among them... leaves me searching for words.The road that takes you to Glacier Pt and Mariposa Grove first takes you right past the parking for the short walk to Bridal Veil Falls, so you won't want to miss it. We visited Yosemite for four days starting May 23,2013, and the water flow for all the falls was spectacular. Don't wait too much later as the flow decreases as the snow melt decreases. You can check current conditions on their website.A drive or shuttle ride around the valley loop will allow you to see the many sights from that perspective. We actually only spent a couple hours there and saw all we needed to see.Since we were headed east towards home at the end of our stay in Groveland ( a cute little town with a great B & B - The Cub Inn which I'll review separately) we left the park via the Tioga Pass Road (Hwy 120). This is my final recommendation: make the effort to go at least as far as Olmstead Point on this road. The view from there lets you see Half Dome from a totally different perspective and you may see hikers climbing the back side of it using the cables provided. Take your binoculars! Tioga Pass Road will also amaze you with many types of rock formations you will not see elsewhere. The Pass itself takes you to 10,000 feet as you exit the park to the east. One caution - if you don't like the mountain driving with its sheer dropoffs and switchbacks, this is not for you.","June 7, 2013","A Bucket List ""Must-do""!",40,"Nashville, Tennessee",5

Yosemite Valley,"Let me start by saying Yosemite Valley is one of the most gorgeous sights I've ever seen. (And I've seen a lot of places) the hiking is superb, the natural wildlife is fascinating and the beauty is endless. That being said, I believe it is one of the most poorly run parks/attractions I've ever seen. The lodging is incredibly overpriced, for $250/night we have no A/C and most of the lights in our room don't work. The staff is either super friendly and helpful, or completely annoyed and uninterested. We are at the Lodge at the Falls and unfortunately they're mostly the later. I don't expect lavish rooms, I wasn't looking for luxury- but for what we are paying I expect more than this.We didn't come for the room, we came for the outdoors, and that I love! We did some great hiking, saw some phenomenal views, and met a lot of amazing people with the same interests we have. Overall it was a good experience- but I can't help but be hugely disappointed in the way the DNC is taking something so beautiful and turning it into, well, this.Also- my husband is currently in Afghanistan, and national parks offer discounts or free entry for active military. However, because my husband is in the National Guard we did not qualify for this, regardless of the fact he is at war right now.","June 5, 2013","Great location, horrible lodging!",9,"Longview, Texas",3
Yosemite Valley,"In addition to information about specific sites in Yosemite, here are some general pieces of advice:If you can stay in the Valley, do so, but you need to plan early. Even trying to book five months ahead, we could not get a hotel, so we stayed at Yosemite West, a condominium complex billed as ""closest to the valley"". It was nice but still a 30 minute drive. If you stay outside the gates, you could have long waits, so stay inside the park. There are also tents and housekeeping cottages at Curry Village, but it's crowded and noisy. Although the hotels are more expensive, we could have shortened the trip by being in the Valley. If you enter from the South and arrive early, stop at Maraposa Grove on the way in, as well as Wawona. You would still have plenty of time to get to the Valley, even with a stop at Tunnel View.Don't miss Glacier Point, but you don't need the tour. The drive to the summit is not that bad, but there are some hairpin turns near the end. You would also have time to stop at at least one of the trails along the road.Use the shuttle In the Valley. The drivers provide great information, and there's no need to drive.Don't miss El Capitan, even if you don't plan to take the strenuous hike. It's thrilling the watch the people climbing the mountain, and there's usually a volunteer on the bridge with a telescope honed in on the climbers.Try at least some of the walks. A few are labeled easy (and they really are). We are not hikers but really enjoyed the strenuous but short hike to Vernal Falls. There are wonderful hikes for those who want something more challenging.The only place we found free wifi was on the porch of a brown building in Curry Village. Just ask any employee if you can't find it.It gets hot; even in early June, the sun was intense by early afternoon. Heed the warnings to take plenty of water because some of the trail heads do not have drinking water. An advantage of staying in the Village is that you can get out of the heat for a couple of hours and then resume touring when it's cooler because there's still plenty of daylight, and the buses run until 10 pm.","June 4, 2013",Yosemite Tips,180,"Rye, NY",5
Yosemite Valley,"Absolutely beautiful, and more breathtaking than we expected - having visited NZ recently, we expected to be left underwhelmed by Yosemite Valley but it didn't disappoint.

Yosemite Valley,"We stayed two nights in the Valley on 28 and 29 May after driving from Palo Alto, which took us about 4 hours. First impression of the Valley. Very crowded with people. A number of people were smoking outside the Yosemite Lodge at the Falls where we stayed, maybe cos of the cold. There were several mosquitoes in our room, which was clean but so so.The next day, as recommended by the forum, we walked the lower yosemite falls trail with a stroller. Easy walk for my son to the lower falls. Wonderful view, but crowded with tourists after 10am. I could stay here and look at the falls the whole day. We walked on down the trail and came to a part with a bench next to a stream where we could see the Upper Falls and was peaceful and serene. We should have packed a lunch to eat, but we didn't and so had to go back to the food court.After lunch, we rested an hour and then took the shuttle from the lodge to Happy Isles w/o the stroller but w a baby bjorn and hiked up to the Vernal Footbridge. Long hike to be carrying a baby. We saw someone taking a stroller but wouldn't recommend it. The slopes can be steep and can't control the stroller coming down. My son and husband went up further to 3 quarters of the Vernal Fall before coming back down. Lots of vicious mosquitoes here throughout the hike. Can't stop to rest before the bridge or will be bitten. Saw deer on the meadows from the shuttle on the way back. No bears sighted though.The next day we checked out and drove south towards San Diego. Stopped at a few scenic places along the way to nurse the baby and take photos. We didn't have time to stop at Mariposa Grove but will do that the next time we visit.","June 3, 2013",First Visit - 2 nights with a baby and six year old,4,"Singapore, Singapore",4
Yosemite Valley,"I don't see another place to include a review on this. But my wife and I rented rafts from the Curry recreation center in yosemite valley and had a terrific time. Some people discouraged us as they said it was a child's activity. It was a really enjoyable time. It is not whitewater rafting. It is a float down the Merced River. It was a really interesting way to see the park in a different way. You rent the boats for a flat rate (per person I believe) and they do not care how long you take. Many people take their time, eating lunch along the river, swimming, taking pictures. It took us about 2 hours. Price is now $30 a person. Totally worth it though. Would recommend it to anyone.","June 3, 2013",Rafting down the Merced,232,"Maple Shade, New Jersey",5

There is so much to do and see and we had only 1 day so we made the most of it by driving through the valley and using our Handicapped Pass were able to get a bit closer to nature via Happy Isles trailhead area.

Yosemite Valley,"Me and my husband went to this wonderful national park from April 27 to April 29, as part of our honeymoon road trip. We entered the park from the south entrance ( we stayed the night before in Bakersfield,so we took the CA-99N and then the CA-41N to Wawona RD.) we arrived early in the morning so we visited the MARIPOSA GROVE ( where you can see the big sequoias, we didn't do the entire trail, but it was beautiful to walk trough the forest,to saw this amazing trees) Then we headed to Yosemite valley, the road was simply amazing, the day was cloudless, and you can see more and more beautiful views, as you gain altitude on the way to the valley.Then we reached a very large tunnel, and then, when you reached the end.... OMG!!! the view was simply breathtaking.. the valley,the mountains,the falls...We continued entered the valley to the village, and then spent the rest of the day, visit the awahnee( a wonderful hotel,with great views of the valley, where you can take a break, have lunch or someting to drink), the village( they have a great sistem of roads, where you can rent bikes or just simply walk around the village, and the valley, you can take the shuttle sistem witch is great too) and at the end of the day we did the lower yosemite falls, witch is an easy trail ( 20 min), where you can get a great view of the upper and lower yosemite falls if you don't want to do the more long trail.We stayed in buck meadows ( one hour from yosemite village), and although the place was amazing( and the hotel was very good, yosemite westgate lodge),if we have to do it again, we'll stay in the park. You loose a lot of time, and even the views are amazing too, if you want to do some hiking like we did, is more comfortable to stay in the park.Then, the next two days, we did mirror lake, Vernal falls and Nevada falls.Mirror lake and the trail to vernal falls, are not to difficult, and really beautiful ( in the falls you have to be careful once you get close to the fall, with the water and watch your step!! )Nevada falls is a more difficult hike( we did it in 5 hours round trip) , and totally amazing when you reach the top! In this trail the last stop for water is at the first bridge before vernal falls, we got water for the nevada falls, but you have to bring a filter or tablet to treat the water.When we headed down, we took the J.Muir trail, so we could get a different views of the fall. It was amazing, to saw the rainbow in the nevada fall at late afternoon.We reached the end of the trail at 5:30 p.m. and we had some dinner at curry village.A really amazing national park!!! A few tips: We cannot go to glacier point( where you can see a great view to all the valley) and there's another places that you cannot visit until mid or end of may, for example tuolumne meadows or if you want to hike to the top of half dome. So if you don't want to miss this things, go in this time of the year if you can. And we wish that we can stayed a few days more, so we can do other trails and hikes.IT was really a wonderful experience that i hardly recommend if you love nature and open spaces!!!","June 2, 2013",Yosemite in April,58,"Montevideo, Uruguay",5
Yosemite Valley,"Just went here over the memorial day weekend & was totally impressed. With a diverse landscape , from the grey beauty of Half Dome to the Switzerland-like feel of Toulumne Meadows , this place has so much to offer. The action doesn't stop at night too when ranger lead tours take you around the valley in moonlight.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite valley is geographically a relatively small land area that contains the wonderful rock formations (half dome, arches, El Capitan) and waterfalls (bridal veil falls, Yosemite falls) seen in many famous photographs, books, and films. It's unique in that some many awe-inspiring sights are contained within a small area. There are many flat trails, both paved and unpaved, which allows access for all, including wheel chairs, strollers, bicycles, and walkers. There are also plenty of more strenuous trails for people seeking a more challenging physical adventure. Various trails allow one to take in the famous sights from many different vantage points and angles. There are shuttle buses that continuously make the loop through the valley so you can park your car in one place and explore the valley all day without having to worry about finding a parking place.","May 31, 2013",Gorgeous and accessible for everyone,6,"Orange, California, United States",5
Yosemite Valley,"I got to cut through the park in September and thought it was pretty then, things were closed for the season so we just drove through. We just got to go back on a long road trip and found it was even more beautiful in May. We drove through on highway 395 and there was one part coming into the park that was just what you think an American National park should look like, it had a meadow at the bottom, gorgeous tree line and a beautiful mountain view above. It was almost sad to keep driving past such a scene. If I could say anything negative, it might be about the park ranger attitude at the gate. On the way out, we dimmed the headlights so not to blind the ranger shack, We were right up on the shack when we did this and the woman wanted to act like we just drove miles without lights. My husband, who is a veteran, explained that coming up to military bases and the gate shack, you were required to turn the lights to driving so as to not blind them. She got very snippy about how they were not a military base. WOW lady, just trying to help you out. Glad this was on the way out and not on the way in. Otherwise, beautiful trip through.","May 31, 2013",Second time just as beautifula as first,89,"Brightwood, Oregon",4

As you drive to the valley, a panoramic view opens up that cannot be compared to any place on earth. Half Dome, El Capitan, and Bridal Veil falls create a landscape that will inspire any person and one can simply stand there in awe. This is just the beginning. A magnificent drive to Glacier Point will give one a view of the entire valley from an equal height of the monoliths . Yosemite falls, Nevada Falls and Vernal Falls are also in this spectacular view. There are Hikes galore, all varied difficulty, And a myriad of other venues to explore. This is one of the great places on our planet.

Yosemite Valley,"You can't beat the views here. Every direction boasts something unique and spectacular. In spring all of the waterfalls are running full, adding to the views -- by late summer they can shut down totally. On that basis, it's a sure five. If you come when the weather is decent, though, expect that you will have a lot of company. That shouldn't come as a surprise when you consider how many millions of people live within an easy day's drive. If you come from Fresno, the southern entrance involves an hour of driving along narrow roads on steep hillsides with a posted speed limit of 35 mph. If you try to drive at that speed you will be tailgated by a host of would-be Parnellis who think they are capable of going at twice that rate.

Yosemite Valley,"We loved exploring Yosemite. The vistas were amazing. I would highly recommend the Valley Floor tour as an overview and going in the spring when the waterfalls can be seen. A couple of things to keep in mind- some of the attractions are far away (Bridal Veil, Glacier Point and Mariposa Grove) from the shuttle loop and must be accessed by car or tour so that should be taken into account when making plans and also, we were warned not to leave a morsel of food (including gum) or scented cosmetics in our car due to the hungry bears in the area.

Yosemite Valley,"We traveled from San Diego to Yosemite Valley (overnight stop in Coarsegold) with a 10 year old and a 6 year old. We tent camped in Upper Pines campground. I don't know where to start. This had to be the best family vacation - far exceeding my expectations. We drove in from the south entrance and stopped to walk through the giant sequoias. There was no parking in the giant sequoia lot so we had to park at Wawona and take the shuttle and I'm so glad we did! Wawona is beautiful. The covered bridge and river were too perfect. The giant sequoias were giant - something that we will remember for a long time. Then we drove up to Glacier Point (the view is so worth the detour) and finally down into Yosemite Valley. While there (we camped for four nights) we did the hike up to Mirror Lake (wear mosquito repellent) the first day. Very easy hike, fun to follow the river and the lake itself is pretty - the lake is more like a meadow with a small body of water in it. Second day we did the Mist Trail to Vernal Falls. Very challenging - and you get wet! The kids powered through, they were excited about the river and the water fall. The third day we got about half way up to Upper Yosemite Falls. The view was amazing. Another fun thing to do while you are there is to river raft down the Merced River. Take you time, plan on stopping at the beaches along the way to get your money's worth. Also, we really enjoyed the visitor's center and the movie they run every thirty minutes, ""The Spirit of Yosemite"". The camground was exactly what you would expect from a car camping site. Very limited but they did have electricity in the bathrooms. And there were enough bathrooms - lots of garbage cans, food storage lockers (bear proof!), a picnic table, fire pit, and the sites themselves were a good size. I cannot wait to start planning our trip for next year!","May 24, 2013",There are no words... beyond our expectations!,90,"San Diego, California",5

The views, mountains, rivers, lakes and waterfalls, the camp grounds, giant pines, tunnels and hiking trails make for one beautiful destination. It has the best hiking trails for both the thrill and adrenaline lovers, while offering the casual walker also a chance to enjoy its beauty at lower elevations. The floor loop is the best for the walker or slow hiker.Plenty to do this time of year, we saw many families with children riding on their bicycles, while others played by the lake; some were walking and others preparing to climb El Capitan.

Yosemite Valley,"This review is aimed more at our Biker friends- we rode south to the park down CA49 to CA120. Took the Old Priest Cutoff to save 5 miles. All roads are in excellent condition and surrounded by great scenery. My Disabled Vet Access Pass got BOTH bikes into the park (unlike at Sequoia where Miss Snotty Ranger made me pay for my wife). 18 miles from the entrance to the Valley past photo ops every 25 feet. This is not the busy season so there was very light traffic and a little road work which was no problem. The cagers that were around us were distracted and not paying attention to the road at all and were very aggressive in the parking lots so be careful! I was told by a tourguide that the line of traffic is bumper to bumper 2 miles out of the gate trying to get in during July. We are not hikers but like to shop the junk stores and see a good museum...here, the museum and Visitor's Cente are ho-hum. The Grille behind the Store wants about 12 bucks for a burger. In fact, I watched one other guest bring his once-bitten burger back to the cashier and told her to throw it away! We did have coffee and one of their homemade Oatmeal Raisin cookies which was a little burned but did come with a full helping of heartburn! All in all, the riding in the area for a hundred miles around is fantastic with beautifully kept roads, gas stops, and little towns to rummage around in. Yosemite is well worth the trip, but expect to pay TOP dollar if you stay anywhere near the park. $550/night is possible IN the park and almost $200/night within 10 miles for a room you'd get elsewhere for 79 bucks.","May 21, 2013",Unspeakable beauty,217,"Chandler, Arizona",5

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite National Park has got to be one of the most stunning places on earth. When I say civilised, I mean that it is accessible, well-visited, and well-oiled. There are cars, and buses all over the place and there are very few places in the valley where you will find yourself alone. Having said that, it is so well-managed that you really don't feel the park is overused. The views are truly magnificent and it is breathtaking to watch how each well known landmark changes as the light changes. This is a landscape photographers Eden. It is great for couples, friends or families who love the great outdoors, and who enjoy long walks or horseback rides. It's easy even for those who do not like walking or horses. There are bus shuttles, scenic buses, and bicycle tours that will take you almost anywhere in the valley (there will always be a bit of walking for the more remote areas). I went in Spring, and everyone who worked there said it was the best time to go. They also said that summer time is just too crowded. I went for 2 too-short nights.

The walk to the Upper Falls takes approx 1 hour to get halfway up the mountain to see a real good close up.

Yosemite Valley,"Not much can be written about Yosemite that has not been written a hundred times before so I am confining this review to the bike trails since that is why I went to the park in the first place.I have been to Yosemite before and have walked and drove around it but biking is the best way to go. Walking can take you several days to see everything and when you drive you miss a lot. Taking your bike and two wheeling around allows you to see everything, stop when and where you want, and it is great exercise as well. Most of the trails are well marked though some are pretty rough and made me glad I have a mountain bike. The best trail is the one to Mirror Lake. It is wide enough for both bikes and pedestrians and in the end you wind up at a natural dam that creates a small lake (see picture). The last leg of this trail is closed to rental bikes, that only have one gear, because it is rather steep but if you take your own bike and can make the climb, then go for it. Getting to the top is worth the effort and the ride down can be very wild. My only problem with biking Yosemite is the map that is provided. It is so confusing, it is almost not worth looking at. I got lost several times and had to stop and ask directions. I would like to see a map just for bike trails instead of the current one that includes tram routes, car routes, etc. all jumbled into one page.","May 13, 2013",Biking is the only way to go.,10,"Oxnard, California",4
Yosemite Valley,"The Yosemite Valley Park is one great attraction of natural, huge rock formations with waterfalls in some sections. It took us around three hours from our hotel to reach the park. The temperature became gradually colder as we got near the valley park. Along the way, there are snow formations in between tall vegetation. At the valley park, one feels the cold, cold snow formations as we walked around to capture the beauty of evergreens covered by snow, playing around to form a huge Snow Man, posing for pictures every moment as we chance upon a beautiful spot worth capturing. The huge rocky mountains with waterfalls between snow formations were a perfect background of frameable pictures.","May 12, 2013",The Amazing Yosemite Valley Park,1,"Caloocan, Philippines",5

Am I thankful that we did! It was beyond all my expectations. We were lucky to be there at a relatively slow time. I couldn't believe that I had been so many places but never here.

Yosemite Valley,"Upon returning home and downloading photos, I realized that a picture that I took was taken from the same vantage point as other pictures I have seen in magazines and books. It was funny that I did not recognize it when I was standing at the scenic overlook.Yosemite is a superb national park and the $20 entrance fee was worth it (The fee is good for 7 days to any other national park). This late March visit was matched with snow and ice in the higher elevations, but for the most part did not dampen enjoying the scenic beauty. Be sure to follow park cautions and warnings (e.g., having chains for tires). Unfortunately, Tioga Pass was closed, I hear it is breathtaking. Although the park does not recommend using a GPS, we found it to provide accurate directions; however, the default map speed limit does not match the slow driving conditions (e.g., curvy and hilly roads) so your arrival time will be off considerably. Crowds and traffic were minimal in late March. The only problem encountered was parking at Bridal Veil Falls, so I would recommend parking at an alternative location and walking or consider biking.If you are not staying in the park, consider taking a picnic lunch or other edibles. There are only a handful of food service restaurants and they become busy and are expensive. If you want a picture of the park entrance, you will have to travel to the northern entrance. Remember, only leave footprints and take pictures. Leave the park as you found it.","May 7, 2013",I've seen that picture,14,"Atlanta, Georgia",5

Yosemite Valley,"We drove the loop on a rather overcast day and the views of the mountains, streams, and trees was spectacular. Here is the key..divide the park into mini-trips if you have the time. The Valley, the redwoods, the meadows, etc. Plan on a couple of hours drive time to each round trip. Then take your time and stop at the turnouts; don't just zoom through to get to one destination. We chose the loop and will do it again on a sunny day as we have a week here. However, there are so many unique things to see along the way (besides the major areas) that you will miss 50% of the pleasure of this trip. Stop at the bridge and view Yosemite Falls, try to catch a reflection in the water if it is calm. See the church and get out and examine the stone bridges. I found a rope swing someone had secured to the tree and it made a neat picture. May is a nice time to be here as the falls are full and there are less people.

Yosemite has so much to offer that it is not just a national park but a national treasure. From the Sequoias to Half-Dome, if you just want to drive around or hike all day long, Yosemite is a must see for all Americans. But you need to remember that they limit the number of cars allowed into the valley and thus during the busy summer months, you'll need to get there early in the morning to make sure you get in and don't get stuck in a very long line of cars.","May 2, 2013",BREATH-TAKING VIEWS,207,"Edgewood, New Mexico",5

Yosemite Valley,"Okay. So I know most everyone has to confine their vacations to coincide with the kids getting out of school, etc., and so most EVERYONE visits Yosemite in the summer. And it's gridlocked with tourists and, while there is NEVER a bad trip to Yosemite you can have the taste for it taken right out of your mouth when it feels more like a two-hour wait for a Disneyland single-ride attraction. That's why you have to defy all the ""shoulds"" and make your OWN decisions. If you live within driving distance, pull the kids out for a day or two and go midweek or make it a weekend must-do in the spring. The dogwoods usually bloom in late April and the crowds are non-existent. Sure, you'll see people but the main thing you'll see is the Valley, the gargantuan looming rocks of El Capitan and Half Dome, the meandering and winsome Merced River, and you'll be able to park and walk and talk and take it all in without shoving elbow-to-elbow with everyone else trying to do the same thing. Visit the Awahnee Hotel and stroll through the massive common areas, enjoying the fireplaces. Dine casually at lunch or dress up for dinner in the hotel dining room. With luck you will view an outdoor wedding on the expansive lawns just outside the main hotel. Price too steep at the Awahnee for an overnight stay? (Yes, $500+ is too rich for my blood, too, for a non-posh room.) There are a LOT of great options nearby or just outside the park. But come in the spring. Revel in the waterfalls and the empty spaces and see Yosemite with no one to block a single view. Yosemite is timeless but opportunity isn't.

When you see El Capitan and Half Dome, you'll understand why John Muir was so determined to preserve this special place.

Yosemite Valley,"One of best National Parks I've seen so far and I've been to a lot. Mile for mile this place versus others was great, so much to see without driving hours & hours around the park. Don't be fooled though, the drive in is very slow due to twisting winding roadway, so leave early in order get to the park early, beacuse you'll want a full day to take in the beauty of Yosemite. One thing I didn't like though is this, hiked in about 2 miles of what should've been a roughly 3.4 mile trec to see the Nevada Waterfall only to find out, last part of the trail to the top of Nevada was closed due to falling rocks...something IMO they've should've posted notice of at beginning of the trail. Also the shorter of 2 routes from Vernal to Nevada might only be .6 miles, but it's a tough one involving climbing up lots & lots of rock steps, something I found much easier to do in reverse while coming down from top of Vernal after reaching it via the longer much less steep 2 mile hike around the other way. Hope this makes sense.","April 7, 2013",Fantastic,26,"Hyde Park, New York",5
Yosemite Valley,"Finally! I made it here with my kids. I grew up spending a week every summer at this magical place. The valley floor has changed a bit over the years but the park itself is still as magnificent as I remember. I scour this site for lots of detail so I will try to provide it here.RESERVATIONS: Very stressful for me. Once the window opens, sites are gone in minutes. No joke. Online is the way to go I think. I was poised and ready, watching the seconds count down on my computer clock to 7am. This is the exact moment reservations open exactly 6 months prior to when you wish to go. I had done lots of research, looking at pictures of the sites (which you can do online), reading reviews, etc. I had printed a map and made a list of sites I wanted. Then when the window opened I moved down the list, snagging the first 2 sites available. The rules were very clear that only 6 people can stay at a site and with 6 kids alone I needed 2 sites. Although no one ever came and did a headcount. And really, would they have made us leave because my toddler and preschooler put us over the 6 person limit? But I'm just a rule-follower kind of person. Anyways.......Where we stayed: Lower Pines, sites 70, 71. This turned out to be perfect for us. It backed up against a field. The sites were flat, which cuts down on falling toddler injuries. (it's easier for the baby to walk around) We were far enough from the bathrooms that lights and sound didn't affect us but close enough that we could make it when the preschooler came running up doing a potty dance. Restrooms were clean! Water was COLD.BIGGEST NOTE: When they say no food in vehicles, this means NO FOOD IN VEHICLES. There are bear lockers, one per site. They are deep and low to the ground. This was a HUGE pain in the butt. With a family of 8, there is a lot of food. Including the big, white Costco cooler. Which DOESNT fit in the locker. The solution? The rangers have 'loaner' coolers (if you're lucky). I had to borrow 3 highly inferior, dirty coolers. I was very thankful because the alternative was to buy coolers at the exorbitant prices at the village store. But still. The ice melted faster and I had to wrangle 3 coolers instead of one. The ranger (Eric, who was awesome) told me some of the sites have newer bear lockers that are slightly bigger and may possibly hold the big Costco cooler. We didn't have time to test. Next time we will definitely find a site that has a newer bear locker. It was a good thing I had those two sites because all our food and toiletries certainly didn't fit into one bear locker.BRING BIKES if possible. It is still the best way to get around. Besides walking. The buses are nice and they are very accommodating about strollers, but it takes awhile.Ranger Eric said he and his fellow rangers are very happy to talk with you about sites that best suit your needs. Normally we walk through campgrounds and mark things on a map but there are so many sites and better things to do with your time. He said just call and talk to a ranger about the sites and they can help you find a good site for your needs.All in all it was fantastic and we can't wait to go again next year.","April 7, 2013",Yosemite National Park,27,Fremont,5
Yosemite Valley,"This is a spectacular place. Our 3 kids (2, 6, and 9) had the best time. First day was Mariposa Grove. We had such a good time being surrounded by the natural beauty and giant trees that the kids didn't even realize they had hiked all the way to the Fallen Tree in Mariposa Grove - 5 miles or so. We brought a picnic with us and ate at the top at the museum - even though it was closed, we were in awe of the giant sequoias. Day 2 and day 3 we went into the valley and stopped several times at the picnic areas to play along the river on the sandy beach, saw deer swim across the river and had a picnic. The kids were amazed by the waterfalls, a very easy walk, and enjoyed the frequent stops at the look outs.The junior ranger program was excellent. We have done several at various locations but were impressed by the cultural talk led by Julia Parker at the Indian Village. I was honoured to be invited into the round house with the huge group and listen to more of Julia's stories. (Note...even though Julia asked for respect not to take pictures in this sacred building, a few tourists did so anyway).

I stumbled upon photographer, Nancy Robbins, before I left for my trip. I am an avid people photographer, but don't have too much experience in landscapes and wanted to maximize what I could capture during my trip. I spent a little over 3 hours with Nancy for a very reasonable cost. She teaches to any experience level and her tips on where to go in the park, and the best times of day to photograph different lights, were invaluable. She has been living in Wawona, within the park, for over 10 years, so she had tons of tips and spectacular places to go that are off the beaten path. I didn't take advantage of portraits of my family, because I do that myself, but she does lots of portrait sessions within the park that would make fabulous keepsakes.

Yosemite Valley,"We come to Yosemite Valley at least once a season. We love spring the best because that is when the flowers are bright and colorful and all of the waterfalls are absolutely crazy. We tend to not play in any of the water during this time of year because even though the river can look really calm the current can be much stronger than expected and we have had some scary experiences with that. So we just enjoy the watching the wildlife and doing small hikes.During the Summer it's not to hot. Usually the waterfalls are dry then so we tend to pick neck and build things out of rocks, sand, and sticks. Fall we're still building things but if it rains before then there is normally a bit going down the falls so we tend to hike more again. Winter is a very different ball game. When it is snowing hard when we are there it is all about the snow games. There are designated snow play areas but pretty much everyone plays anywhere that is normally a path. When it is in between snow storms it is about how unique and different everything is.

Yosemite Valley,"We visited Yosemite Valley as a family at the end of March. The weather was good and there was very little snow. The only snow was in the shady areas of the park. There were very little crowds and parking was not a problem at all, even when we didn't get into the valley until 10 or 11am. (We stayed at the Tenaya Lodge outside of the park) We spent one day at Mariposa Grove, one day hiking to the top of Vernal falls and doing the easy hike to Lower Yosemite Falls, and one day following the bike/foot trail all around the village/valley just exploring with our kids (ages 6 and 9). All days were equally fun but the most exciting was our hike to Vernal Falls! During this time of year, we were fine with staying outside the park and driving in because parking and getting around the valley was easy due to lack of crowds. If you plan to go in the summer, I would recommend staying in the valley. All major waterfalls were flowing but there were some attractions that were closed ... no horse back riding, some closed stores, etc. Things seem to be opening within the next couple months.

Best of all, NONE of the awful crowds you hear about in the summer. No lines, parking available at every stop, etc. You are somewhat limited as the main road thru the park is closed in winter, but in our two days we saw all of the valley (the main attraction) as well as the Mariposa Grove.

Yosemite Valley,"No matter what time of year you visit, Yosemite National Park is breathtaking. Late April through June the waterfalls are at their peak, dogwood trees and wild flowers are blooming and you may even still see some snow in sheltered areas! Summer brings long days for hiking, cycling, camping and picnics. Although in Autumn the falls are usually dry, the brilliant colors of the trees add a special contrast against the grandeur of the huge granite formations, and many mountain climbers can be see on the face of El Capitan. Yosemite in winter brings snow and a quietness to this natural wonderland. Roads in the valley are always open and maintained, but the higher areas, like Glacier Point are not accessible. But no matter which month you visit, Yosemite is an ""experience."" Take your camera - there are amazing photo opportunities everywhere. SPECIAL NOTE: Lodging reservations fill up well in advance in Yosemite Valley, so plan ahead. There are very nice places to stay outside of the valley, but that means you'll have a short drive (30 minutes +) to get to the valley floor.","March 18, 2013",Year-round Beauty & Majesty,40,"Turlock, California",5

The drive to the park was about 30 minutes and so beautiful that you don't even realize the distance. Just wish we could stay longer to do some hikes. We were there for 2 days. We saw the most important places, but would love to go back and get to the more ""secret spots"".Our highlight was to see bear cubs climbing down a tree next to the road while we were driving. There was lots of cars, but such a special 2 minutes that it witll be etched in our minds forever. We don't get to see bears in the southern hemisphere. The only sad thing was that we saw a teenager bear dead on the side of the road outside of the park one morning. A car must have hit it. It was so sad. I think there are too many cars and people. It is one of the most famous parks so it is probably understandable.The waterfalls was stunning and the size of the rocks unbelievable.We will definitely be back one day.))","March 14, 2013",Exceeded our expectations!,10,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",5

Yosemite Valley,"Any photographer worth his stop bath and fixer knows the name Ansel Adams. Perhaps more than anyone else, Adams immortalized the famous Yosemite National Park on film. Many of his photos were taken in winter, and this is why:First, the crowds are a fraction of the size they are during the summer months. And while some roads and passes are closed due to the weather, the valley itself can be experienced as long as one has the clothing and car equipment necessary.Second, the many (sixteen, as reported by the Ranger accompanying my group) waterfalls dry up or become non-existent during the warmer days. During winter, the spectacular Upper Yosemite Falls spills dramatically over its precipice. If the nights are cold enough, the drop is sufficient to freeze the water mid-fall, resulting in an impressive ""snow cone"" that can be hundreds of feet high. When visiting the valley during winter, one can literally hear the avalanches from on high, as snow and ice break free and cascade down the steep slopes. Wildlife (deer and coyotes) are in evidence, and one may be fortunate to spot a mountain lion or a bear. The Wawona Hotel is closed during the winter (economic times, they say) but the Ahwanee is not. Even if one doesn't spend the $400/night to stay in one of its 99 rooms, a visit to this historic landmark should be on the agenda. It's a marvel of architecture and design. It's been the host to royalty and world leaders.Yosemite Village includes a museum, the Ansel Adams Gallery, some shops and places to eat. The Lodge is a more modern hostel, and includes dining, wi-fi and most of the amenities of home. Hiking, even in winter, is possible, and can range from short (1-3 miles) trips to Mirror Lake, Bridalveil Falls and Lower Yosemite Falls to the all-day (6-8 hours) voyages to Upper Yosemite Falls and elsewhere. Be sure to wear warm, waterproof boots, as there is almost certain to be snow on the ground and paths.There are free shuttles through the valley, so my recommendation is to find lodging outside the park, then make your way to the village, park, and then walk or ride. I like the south entrance to the park, where lodging can be found less than 20 miles away. A one-hour drive then takes one up and down and finally through the tunnel, where the impressive Tunnel View of El Capitan, Half Dome and Bridalveil Falls is the ""welcome"" sight that informs one that Yosemite has been reached. It's a sight that will burn itself into one's memory.The geology, the history and the grandeur of Yosemite are sure to expand one's perspective on the wonders of this world!","February 25, 2013",Winter in Yosemite - Ansel Adams Had It Right,45,"Ashburn, Virginia",4
Yosemite Valley,"People can tell you how exciting a trip to Yosemite can be, and you can see photos and videos of this spectacular park, but to experience it first hand is indescribable. Seeing Yosemite in person is awe-inspiring. And seeing it in the winter, when attendance is down, and there is a sparkling “magic” in the air, is fantastic! We spent four days between Christmas and New Year 2012 exploring the highlights of Yosemite. We snowshoed in Mariposa Grove and up to Dewey Point. We hiked the Mist Trail to Vernal Falls. We hiked to Upper and Lower Yosemite Falls, and got to see Bridalveil Falls and the Tunnel View of Yosemite Valley. The evening we hung out on our snowshoes in the Ahwahnee Meadow watching the sun set on Half Dome was a real treat! I took well over 1,000 photos and upon my return home was only able to cull them down to about 600 (which can only trigger memories of what no camera can capture from reality).YOSEMITE IS A MUST FOR EVERY BUCKET LIST!!!","February 24, 2013",Truly Awesome!,33,"Dover, Vermont",5

The park pass is valid for 7 days so try to make most of it. If you love snow then Badger Pass is your place to go but i got serious bruise at places that i can not even name. Yosemite Valley is definitely going to see me again. Try to drive slow because roads are narrow and also you will miss hidden waterfalls and wild animals of the park. Take extra battery coz i ran out with my 2 sets. Opinion - don't go to see Gaint Sequoias Tree (Redwood) unless you have not seen a big thick tree. It is very far and you will loose time driving back to valley if you want to see Horse Tail Falls. i missed it but it looks magical ; like Hot Lava flowing of the cliff into a waterfall. i stayed at Miners Inn in Mariposa which is near to my side of California.

It has been about 10 years since I visited and way over due!I completed the short hike to the Upper Sequoia Grove near Wawona with my wife. She had a great time photographing these beautiful giants in a winter setting. The hike is very easy, about 1.5 miles from the parking lot, a little more if you allow yourself to crisscross trails.Also, visiting Yosemite Falls this time of year allows you to get really close to the base of the lower falls without getting drenched or fighting huge crowds.If you can get to Yosemite this time of year, do it!

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is beautiful anytime of the year, but snow makes it particularly special. Things to know: Hwy 140 park entrance can have a long line during holidays; we waited almost an hour in line. Once inside the park, there was a vehicle check for chains, AWD / 4-wheel / snow tires because of slick drving conditions. Bring chains and be prepared to install them, or you will be stopped and required to purchase chains in the park. AWD and 4-wheel are not exempt but we were not required to buy chains. A link to more detailed info: http://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/tirechains.htmIf you see something you want a closer look at, find a convenient pull-out or parking area. Your fellow drivers will appreciate you not stopped in the middle of the road looking at El Cap or any of the falls. The same for deer on the side of the road. If they are on the road way, carefully navigate around them. Uggs might look warm, but the sole is not good in snow. Same for athletic shoes - no traction. We saw many people attempting to walk on packed snow with painful results. Pack a lunch, water, other beverages. Camp store at Curry Village is undergoing remodeling with a reduced inventory. The store at Yosemite Village is well appointed and you can find just about any food item you want, including meats to grill if you are camping. The Mountaineering store closes promptly at 4pm in the winter.We walked the loop back to Happy Isles having parked in the North Pines lot. It is a 1.5ish mile walk on a paved, snow packed surface. If you become tired, shuttles run through there frequently. There were many families sledding on the not-too-steep slopes, perfect for young kids.Be smart about being in the outdoors, pack extra clothes (forewarned - many of the bathrooms are pit toilets and unheated), layers of clothing work well if the day warms up, and dry socks always feel great after a day of tromping through the snow.Enjoy the adventure and breathtaking beauty of the Valley.","January 6, 2013",Winter Wonderland 12/28/12,26,Turlock,4

The waterfalls are spectacular (which is a total understatement) and there are a few pretty good sized rocks here....like Half Dome, El Capitan.... The meadow is pristine natural beauty. The hiking trails are amazing. You can watch the seasons change by the trees. You will most likely see wildlife such as deer, coyotes and maybe even bears (although you probably want to avoid the latter). The drive up to the Valley is beautiful all by itself but when you go through the Oakhurst route you're in for a real treat. The initial view of the Valley will literally take your breath away and maybe even reduce to tears by it's raw, natural, unadulterated beauty. This is an absolute must-see if you're in California. I live here and it continues to amaze me each and every time I drive into the Valley. There are many restaurants, hotels and motels in all price ranges close by this destination in Oakhurst, CA, Mariposa CA and a few along the way into the park, as well as the well known exquisite Ahwahnee Hotel which has been inside the Park since early this century. It has an old world grace and charm that is indescribable. The Marriott Tenaya is along the road as well and is a spectacular hotel that showcases the mountainous ambience. There is a village store in Yosemite Valley that sells groceries and dry goods and souveniers. There is a medical clinic located in the Valley, as well. I definitely recommend this destination to families, singles, couples and the elderly. Be aware there is a lot of walking involved and there are a lot of hills to walk (we're in the mountains!), but you can choose where you want to go and still see the beauty from any point in Yosemite should you decide not to do all the walking. Picknicking is welcome and there are many sites with tables established for your convenience. Handicapped friendly wherever possible.","December 9, 2012",BREATHTAKING!,4,"Ahwahnee, California",5

I've visited the valley in early December and despite light rain the trip was very much worth it. The sequoyas were a bit of a disappointment to me - other than one they can't be reached for a good photo shot. El Capitan, waterfalls and the pines in the valley have made a great impression on me. Highly recommended and I'd suggest staying at least over night in a camp to have enough time to properly explore the place.","December 1, 2012",Magnificant place,55,"Meyrin, Switzerland",5
Yosemite Valley,"For over 30 years, my sister has collected friends and family to share Thanksgiving dinner in the Yosemite Valley.Have you ever seen 15 - 20 crock pots lined up in a row outside on a crisp fall evening? The spicey aromas waft through the trees and attract many a passerby.So far, however, not the bears whom we trust are going into hibernation. Even so, clean up is a must as they can still come out at night in search of that last morsel before they lay themselves down for a cold winters sleep. To keep warm, mulled wine and hot apple cider is near. What a wonderful way to give thanks for the beauty of this valley. On Black Friday, the group hits the sales at the Ansel Adams store then hikes up to Vernal Falls. One of the teenagers in our group said there were 664 steps! You need to be in good condition for this walk but the top of the falls, where we all share lunch perched on top of the big boulders, is mightly worth the effort. Another walking tour is to Mirrior Lake -especially when the water table is up. A hop onto the buses, which run constantly throughout the valley, is a welcome sight and relief for those who think it's time to rest until the next stop. One cannot leave the valley without visiting the Awahnee Hotel. A mangnificent mountain mansion. The bar is not bad either and the gift shop - just divine!

Miss a hiking trail, a photo point, or a river valley because the NPS hasn't figured out how to provide a sign for the location a few hundred yards prior to getting there.Don't stop on the roadways, because we don't allow you to pull off the roads after we placed boulders and tree trunks in your way.Watch your speed, more rangers are now employed writing tickets than interpreting the park and answering your questions.Park in the approved lot for the visitor center (handicapped directions NOT provided), wait 30 minutes for the 10-minute shuttle bus, and then discover it's going AWAY from the visitor center on this leg. You'll get there some time. Pay 40% more for souvenir items than you'd pay in other national parks.And still, Yosemite is a natural wonder. Bring your patience.

Also a pizza place provided pretty good pizzas.There were some nice walks in the valley but if you go in the fall expect dry waterfalls. There are many longer walks available- with half dome needing to by balloted for prior to going.

We entered through the south gate and became a little discouraged after driving this winding road for almost an hour toward Yosemite valley w/o seeing anything spectacular. But one we emerged through the tunnel and saw the view it literally took our breath away. We did several hikes over 2 and 1/2 days and couldn't believe how many pictures we took of the vistas. I would be a little cautious about the hike ratings. Even the 'easy' and 'moderate' hikes were more like 'moderate' and 'strenuous'. Make sure you do the valley loop, bridal veil falls, sentinel dome, and Taft point. Vernal falls is awesome but be prepared for some strenuous climbing, especially the last 0.1 miles (which is almost straight up). This park should be on everyone's bucket list.

Yosemite Valley,What can I say. Some of the most amazing sights you will ever see. Make sure that you get out of your car as much as possible. Look up at El Capitan and see if you can spot some of the climbers that look like ants. Make sure you take binoculars for the whole of Yosemite. Get a good guide book and do some of the trails down here. There are plenty to suit all abilities. We were there in September so the falls and rivers had no or little water running through them By all accounts spring is the best time to go as the wild flowers are also out then. It was very arid when we were there but still well worth the hours of driving.,"September 27, 2012",Spectacular,143,"Hadleigh, United Kingdom",5
Yosemite Valley,"If you ever want to feel truly small and that you are a part of something much bigger than yourself go to Yosemite. We walked a number of hikes, staying outside the park. Next time I would stay in the park as you can spend too much time in your car. I have never been to a park this large! We did 4 different hikes in one day - perhaps walked a total of 10 miles...my feet hurt! But it was truly magnicificent!! Figure out a way to go!!

Yosemite Valley,"We first visited Yosemite Valley from the UK in 1996. It was what we would refer to as a whistle stop tour, a brief visit, but what it did make us realise was that we wanted to return. From that first view from the Wawona Tunnel, you are captured by the beauty that is Yosemite. Since then we have been fortunate to return on a further three occasions with our stays getting longer each time. Our most recent visit involved a four night stay and again a lot of hiking of the many fantastic trails. September is a good time for hiking but if it is waterfalls you want to see, September is not the month to come. We found them at their best in May, but what was also noticeable was the increase in visitors. We found September not particularly busy. Parking can sometimes be an issue, but again not on this trip.

It was a great way to get around to the various attractions and to get some amazing views. On day #2 hiked up to Half Dome..OMG what an amazing adventure that was. Passed by two stunning waterfalls, walked along the Merced River then finally (4900 feet of elevation later) made it to the top of the Dome.

Pleasantly surprised by how delicious the grass-fed organic beef hamburgers were in Curry Village. Definitely not what you expect from a national park, much better.

The Valley Floor Tour ($25 pp or $23 seniors) must be reserved ahead yosemitepark.com or 209 372-4FUN. and the Ranger guided tour narrative is very informative. The Valley Shuttle (free) makes getting around the valley easy. We found that eating in rather isolated locations (away from the crowds and the picnic tables) was preferrable, since there were quite a lot of yellow jackets around and my husband was stung once. Bring a headlamp or a flashlight for evening walking, as the paths are not well lit.Driving times at Yosemite are much longer than you might think, because roads are very windy and speed limits are low. Buy food and gas before you are near the park, as we saw regular gas for $5.01 and food prices sky high. As always, we wish we had about a week to be in the park instead of 4 days.

Bring your swim suit & you can refresh yourself in the Merced river after hiking & picture taking. If your going to be here for more than 1 day or are seeing other nearby National Parks.. Highly recommend a Nat park pass, it will save you on entrance fees (bout 20-each park) If you are partially disabled like me there is a special FREE Nat park pass that will allow you special access to roads that are closer to view points that you might normally have to hike to.

Yosemite Valley,"Our family just spent two nights camping in Yosemite Valley. We stayed in the Lower Pines campground, near Curry Village. The campground facility was great! Our site was near the restrooms, which was the only downside. It was also near the river, and if you have kids, that is the place to be! Yosemite has fabulous biking trails, so be sure to take your bikes when you visit in good weather. You can also rent them in the park at Curry Village during your stay. Yosemite has lots of great amenities, such as the pool and showers in Curry Village - for $5, you can use the pool and the showers. There is also a pizza restaurant, store and various other places to purchase goods. Yosemite Village is nearby as is Yosemite Lodge and the food court. If you want to see the Awhanee, but don't want to stay in the hotel, head over there and sit in the great room with fireplaces, or outside on the lawn. You can get cocktails and watch the sunset, or get ice cream in the gift shop and sit on the lawn!Make sure to take some hikes! There are many, at all skill levels. If you don't have bikes but don't want to drive everywhere, the valley has a nice free shuttle system that will take you up and down the valley. The stops are convenient to hikes. Highly recommend, especially at the end of summer (late August-early September) when most of the kiddos have gone back to school and the park is quieter.","September 10, 2012","All that we hoped it would be, and more!",133,"San Luis Obispo, California",5

Yosemite Valley,"Upper pines, Labor Day weekend. The park holds the crowd so well. Even though holiday weekend did not feel crowded with one exeption. Did the Vernal falls & Nevada falls hike. The way up is up. Lots of elevation up. Almost brutal. Beautiful to hang out about the Nevada falls.On the way down take the winter route, much easier on the knees. 6.5 miles or so. The beginning of the trail, from Happy Isles to the bridge was very crowded on our return. Great day hike. Staying at Upper Pines we were able to just walk from our campsite. Very cool. Love parking the car when I get to the park and not use it again until it is time to leave. Bring your bicycle so you can ride to store and showers. On the way out drove to Glacier Point via Tunnel View. Had never done this before and it is a must do from now on. Beautiful does not go far enough to describe. Get your reservation, get to Yosemite.

The geology was spectacular, as well as the lovely mountain lakes, trees, and flowers. The prairie dogs were fun, the deer were ... deer, and the black bear was kind enough to stick around for pictures (although honestly I wish there was a way to punish those visitors stupid enough cruel enough to feel that they need to get close to the bears.

Yosemite Valley,"Do--try to go in the spring when the falls are running -- especially Yosemite Falls which are the only ones easily accessible. Dry by early June most years.Do the easy 1mile each way hiking trail to Mirror Lake. Serene and follows a babbling brook.Do NOT go in any creek, even if it doesn't look like it's moving the water is. 2 deaths while we were there.DOOOO take Tioga Road in the upper area. This is where all the serene creeks, lakes, mountains and hiking trails are. Beautiful view of Half Dome. Escape from the crowds--there are some people--smart.Walk through the half-mile Yosemite Valley Boardwalk starting at least by 8:30 a.m. so you are beating the crowds. You will be surrounded by Half Dome, Yosemite Falls, Sentinel Rock, Cathedral Rocks, small deer, the creek and butterflies. Hardly any people. You'll find that otherwise this place is over crowded.Drive up to Glacier Point for a view of the whole valley but especially at sunset.Do NOT hike up to the bridge to see vernal falls. It's a steep killer and the falls are still very far away. The trail is 8/10ths mile but take 1-1/2 hours because of the steepness. Going down is very difficult, too. Just not worth it. The path is narrow, there is an edge to fall off of, if you don't have a heart attack going up or fall flat on your face going down, you are lucky.These are all things I'd wish I'd known beforehand or learned from experience.","September 6, 2012",Navigate Yosemite,46,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is just a fraction of the total area of the park and yet this Valley draws thousands of visitors like a magnet in the peak summer months. We felt somehow that of all the National Parks to see throughout America,Yosemite is in danger of being loved too much! Not that we can blame visitors (like us) as this valley alone is the epitome of serenity (mostly), natural beauty and ‘postcard perfection‘ in any season you visit!Staying in El Portal, we got around with our own car even though it was nothing short of chaos at times in the main village. The day use car park is big, however get in early or you could be driving round for a while looking for that vacant spot. Each of the food outlets, gift and grocery store was completely frantic in the lunch hour rush so be prepared for a long wait.Everywhere we looked throughout the valley there is something that nature has shaped such as the granite cliffs rising vertically above the valley floor including - El Capitan, Cathedral Rocks, Sentinel Rock, Three Brothers, and the most amazing formation - Half Dome.We saw the entire valley from the most stunning location - Glacier Point, where the panoramas are breathtaking. One of the most recognised and popular viewpoints is Tunnel View, encapsulating every climatic mood adding light and shade across the valley. Cascading waterfalls, like Yosemite, Bridal Veil, Vernal and several more all combine with creeks to join the Merced River winding its way through the valley floor and beyond.Varieties of pine and spruce trees harbour the cheeky Steller’s Jay and the elusive, shy Woodpecker but unfortunately opportunity knocks for Jay’s around the picnic tables and food outlets! We also saw spring wildflowers along the many trails and meadows adding to the kaleidoscope of colours in this natural paradise.There is so much to see and experience in the valley that quality time is essential to enjoy this seven-mile long slice of ‘heaven’.

That's the way Yosemite Valley is and the California people must like it a lot too because most of the people I met were Californians :-) There was a very easy hiking trail to Mirror Lake which you must take, especially if you have children. It's an easy walk and the kids get to play in the water and just splash around. The water is so clear it truly is like a mirror. I've posted some photos. Also, there's free WIFI in the valley in the hotel lobbies and in Curry Village, so you can stop and relax, eat, and post your photos on FB if you'd like before you head back to camp.

Not to over dramatize my experience, but It's truly one of those places that is hard to believe exists. The height of the granite walls, the beauty of the valleys and rock formations is unbelieveable. I was there on a beautiful Sunday afternoon and it did not feel crowded at all. Crowded is relative. Times square in NYC is crowded, waiting in line at Cedar Point is crowded. This place was not. To my surprise, everything is very accessible. There are not a lot of signs saying stay on the path or ""prohibited"" area. You can roam wherever you want. If the weather is warm, take swim suits. People were accessing the river wherever they wanted. Absolutely Awesome! I went to the Valley Floor. If you have days to wander, than you can hit all the major attractions. I was there for 4-5 hours. If you make the Valley your destination, I guarantee you will be able to take in dozens of breath-taking views. Lots of places to stop on the drive in and in the park to pull over and take pictures. Definately a place to go for all ages.

Yosemite Valley,"I first visited Yosemite Valley 15 years ago and was looking forward to returning for a longer stay this time. So much has changed in 15 years! Mostly, there are just too many people allowed into the valley and into Curry Village and campgrounds now. The focus on making money and getting more people through has really ruined the experience. I did find ways to try to avoid the crowds, mostly by getting up very early and hitting the trails by 6:30 AM. However, coming down the trails by 10:30 AM is like walking down a main city street. The constant standing in lines, shuttling around on buses (although the buses are well run and convenient), and gobs of people everywhere completely subtract from the stunning beauty....this is not what John Muir had in mind! Also, the park is poorly marked -- more than once confused by the signage. Finally, it is compIetly overpriced, especially accommodations. Do not stay in Curry Village! Although the most affordable option, it is dirty, crowded and has a major rodent problem. I have visited 32 national parks and this one is by far the worst experience.

Yosemite Valley,"This is my second time to visit Yosemite Park, first is when my son is 18 months old, and this summer my daughter is 2 years old. Sounds hectic and tight being with my kids but for God sake they are having such a great time. We stayed at the Housekeeping Camp for 3 nights, its closest to the river and good for the kids to swim, toast some smore's during the night, watch the stars at the bridge and the wonderful sight is the Half-dome is just behind the scene. We hike down to the Mirror Lake which is gorgeous. At that time, the water is low but still the beach was so amazing. It captures your attention and would want to stay longer just to enjoy how the beauty of nature being untouched. We dine at the Curry Village and oh my their Pizza were delicious. The highlight of this trip is when we visit the Visitors Center wherein history was restored. My family loves the Natives work of Arts and the statue of John Muir was really cool. Sightseeing, Hiking, Log-walking/rock climbing for kids, swimming, animal watching are the fun stuff that my kids love so much. It's an adventure and common it's just here in California. Hotel Facility was good. One thing that it bothers me and to some, the shower room is not capable of handling crowds during summer time. Under the beds are dusty and I just hope they will try to do something about it. Food locker too need some water cleaning. Well thats what camping is all about.

Yosemite Valley,Yestersay (24/8/12) we started our morning at 6:30 waiting for the bus from our San Francisco hotel and took the 4 hour journey to Yosemite national park. The bus driver was kind of annoying I don't know whether it's because I don't get the American humor or he was just informing us of useless information that were somehow jokes to him. The stop we made gave us great photo opportunities you take photos of others and they will take one of you standing on a platform overlooking the canyon with lush green trees and blue skies for days breathtaking! The two downsides: only spending 2.5hours in the park (definitely not enough time) and the minimal signage to tell you where to go on the map that you have in your hands as you walk around the map had numbers the signs didn't have anything but where the accommodations were unless we were just not looking hard enough with our very tight time limit! The photos I did get we're still amazing and I am glad I went however if you do decide to book this trip I highly recommend booking well in advance to stay over night in a lodge and preferably in the spring as we went in summer there was minimal water meaning we didnt get to see the falls at its finest. The reason I say stay overnight the bus driver said the giant falls was a 3 to 6 hour hike and with a 2.5 hour time limit this meant it was ruled out straight away!,"August 24, 2012",Yes and no,25,,4
Yosemite Valley,"I live in the bay area of Northern CA so I am only about 5 hours drive to this wonderful park. My husband and I came for his birthday and stayed at the Wawona Hotel which is just inside the park and near the Mariposa Grove. We visited Glacier Point, drove into the valley and then through the park on our way to Lake Tahoe. Always a breath-taking trip and we could go over and over again and never get tired of this lovely place.","August 23, 2012",You have to see this gem!,36,"San Rafael, California",5
Yosemite Valley,"I simply fell in love with it....the visit was more of a sight seeing than a long vacation but seems I can spend a vacation every year at yosemite. For nature lovers, its heaven. I visited in June, however, April-May seems to be the best time in summers to visit. The water flow comes down by June, so one would enjoy the falls in full bloom during April. Since, we had a toddler, we visited falls which were stroller accessible. But there is a lot of hiking/trekking, if you really want to explore yosemite.","August 22, 2012",Yosemite in Summers,17,"Apex, North Carolina",5
Yosemite Valley,"I'm so glad we came but we probably picked the wrong time of year. We went in August and it was super crowded and hot. Once we had walked around the village there wasn't much else to do in the heat. We also had our baby with us so it was just too hot to hike. I do have to complain about the park workers who were directing traffic. They need to learn how to direct traffic, at one point we waited at a stop sign for 20 minutes and couldn't really undertand why! They just kept letting other cars go. We waited patiently but one man actually got out of his car and started yelling. I almost felt like they were punishing us for being there. As crowded as it was my husband and I eventually just wanted to get out of there which sucked cause we came so far from Florida. I would like to go back one day in the spring when our son is older and we can take our time exploring more when it is less crowded. The crowds in Yosemite really are a shocker.","August 22, 2012",not what I expected,5,,3
Yosemite Valley,"If I could rate this 10 stars, I would. I am now 60 years old, and have gone to Yosemite for 20 years- for enjoyment, to think, to exercise, to take pictures, to heal. I have traveled all over the world but it is still my favorite place on earth. Hard to get to, but that is part of the ""journey"". Best approach- come from the north east, lets say from Lake Placid, south to Mono Lake (fascinating), keep going stright south and entering the Park from the east gate. At the entrance, you will see flat desert to your left, and mountains beginning their rise, 100 feet to your right. You can then more easily visit Toulumne meadows- very special and beautiful.But you are not in the Valley yet. You can of course get there from the above route, or come in more directly from the west (still 5-6 hours from San Francisco). At the head of the valley, you see it all spread before you, and as beautiful as this 5 plus star view is during the day, try and also see it at night from that vantage point, especially in a full moon, which turns the granite cliffs into silver.The mountain formations- El Capitan, Half Dome, the viewing points, the wildlife, the beautiful Merced River that runs through the Valley, the hiking trails, the Ranger talks, the waterfalls in springtime (but pretty dry by late summer), and of course the Redwood Groves-(not in the Valley but a short drive away)- all, alone, are 5 stars and more, but together, you are in the midst of true magic. Picture the Native Americans who first lived there, picture John Muir walking and exploring, and then pick up a broken branch, turn it into a walking stick, and go! (as our then youngest,12 year old son did).Summer is hard to go- very crowded, and you need reservations to stay in Yosemite, even for a camping site, many months in advance- tough to plan. It is also hard to go on a day trip, since you must drive hours each way, in and out, to find anywhere outside the park to stay in. My suggestion- if you can go in September, that has been my favorite time- before the snow closes roads, still people there but not big crowds, and easier to go last minute.But it is worth the effort- truly. Enjoy.","August 21, 2012",Yosemite- My Personal Paradise,68,Connecticut,5
Yosemite Valley,"The mountain views are incredible, and every now and then you catch a glimpse of a water fall. When going, be prepared to hike, because what fun is it if your driving all day? In the valley there are lots of trails. One of them leads you to the information place near Curry village, and the other leads to Brideveil Falls! its aorund a 4.8 mile hike if heading to the Falls. Make sure to take extra snacks and drinks. Also near the trails are creeks you could swim and relax in on the hot summer day! Make sure you enjoy everything nature has to offer, but always using precaution.","August 18, 2012",Beautiful Views,2,"Castro Valley, California",4
Yosemite Valley,"If you love the mountains, you need to drive throughout Yosemite National Park for the magnificent views along every mile. Two places that are not to be missed are Glacier Point for the very best overall view of Half Dome and Yosemite Falls. The Falls are dry in summer but the view is still spectacular of the entire area and one can easily see the worn rock cliffs where the falls flow in the springtime. The second place not to miss is the Mariposa Grove of giant Sequoia trees in the far southwest part of the park. Take the tram for $25+ and enjoy an hour plus among nature's giants without the strenuous hiking along the hilly trails. The central valley village is a horrendous traffic jam but you need to endure it in order to visit the visitors' center and the magnificient Ahwahnee Hotel. Dinner at the Ahwahnee main restaurant is worth the experience, but not the price.","August 18, 2012",Yosemite in the summer,95,Florida,5

After some pretty thorough investigation, I discovered Amtrak from Emeryville, CA at 7:40 a.m., connecting in Merced, CA at 11:00 a.m. to a YARTS bus to Yosemite Valley. There I was forced to stay in Yosemite Valley for almost four hours (oh, no, oh, no, don't throw me in the briar patch!) until the YARTS bus left the Visitor Center at 5:00 for an 8:30 p.m. arrival in Mammoth Lakes. All went smoothly. Buses and train were comfortable, pretty full, and on time. The second best part (after being in Yosemite Valley): the total cost for a senior (over 62) was $39.75! I think the regular adult fare would have been about $10 more, still cheaper than the gas I would have had to buy to make the trip in my car.","August 12, 2012",Bay Area to Mammoth Lakes in one day on public transportation,23,"Oakland, California",5

Traffic going to the valley was fine but heavy getting past where the non-existent (due to late summer) waterfalls were supposed to be. Couldn't get out of the valley for 30 minutes as we were stuck in bumper to bumper stopped traffic while cyclists and even walkers were cruising past on the bike path! Only one road in and out = trouble. Finally found a stop off the main road where we could get out and relax in the river and we were even alone (whew, vacation saved!).

We found parking really quickly (despite what all the guidebooks say), and walked about 1/2 mile to the trail head. The place was crawling with tourists, but once you get further along on the trails (Vernal/Nevada Falls), it's not as crowded. The drive into the valley was also neat to see, and there's pull-outs for taking pictures. On the way to the trail, we saw the tenting area, and it is crowded, so we were glad that we stayed at Tuolumne Meadows for 2 nights and Wawona for another.

Yosemite Valley,"Only the beauty of Yosemite N.P. saved this loooong tour. No pickup from our hotel should have given us a clue to this drawn-out saga. Meeting near the Ferry Terminal, we found a sizeable group waiting for the tour (they advertise and infer smaller groups than coaches yet the group filled a rattly Ford bus with insufficient legroom). The train trip was pleasant to be fair although the tour guide insisted on trying to talk unsuccessfully over the noise of the carriage. However, the public YART bus that took us on a 'slow boat ride to China' journey was pathetic. Slow, slow, slow stopping at public stops on the way both to and from Yosemite and arguably not designed for comfort around mountainous roads. Again to be fair, the tour operated by the National Park rangers in open air trolley cars pulled by a tractor with a ranger's commentary was very good. The worst of our fears occurred after the very slow YART bus trip back to join the tour bus ( there was unfortunately no train trip back due to a later schedule!). Yes, it broke down!! Two hours later and after refusing to alight from the bus on to the side of the dark road at 10.00 pm so that the pickup truck could take the bus away, we boarded another bus that was equally rattly. An approximate 2.00 am drop-off, thankfully near our hotel, made our next day's touring of San Francisco somewhat delayed due to a catch-up sleep.

Yosemite Valley,"Having been to many other national parks, the usual plan of attack is to go to the visitor center first to get our bearings. The signage directing us to the visitor center was confusing at best with the rangers only adding to the confusion when asked for help. This area was overcrowded by far and once we did find the visitor center the overcrowdedness slapped you in the face with never ending lines and not the best of smells. The bear scare message was made loud and clear with multiple (dated) videos along with warning flyers on top of warning flyers on top of warning flyers. However, the bear canisters provided by the park were less than ample recepticles for us who were on day one of a 2 week camping trip. When we asked for suggestions from the park ranger on what to do with our food the best one given was to transfer all of our food into ziplock bags and hope that it all didn't spoil overnight. In general the views were great - waterfalls, mountains, rivers, and meadows. However, the poor park layout and incessant crowds manage to takeaway most of the natural beauty the park should have to offer.","August 7, 2012","The closer you get, the harder it is to find.",23,"Walnutport, Pennsylvania",3

Larry and Mishma were amazing to work with and accomodated our every need. They picked our group of 15 up at the Tenaya Lodge in a wagon led by two strong horses and drove us one mile down a secluded road to their stables. One child was too young to come out on the trail but they led him on a horse with a lead rope around their corral while the rest of the group rode the trail. They taught the rest of us how to ride a horse and briefed on important safety information before gearing us up. We had so much fun just practicing in the corral! Then we were led down a (steep!) trail to cross over a multitude of stream as dappled sunlight poked through the branches on the national forest. This was an amazing experience.Larry and Mishma were incredibly warm and welcoming. They went above and beyond in hosting a marvelous gathering for our family.Many members of our family reunion were vegetarian and they created an entirely vegetarian cowboy cookout using tofu and soy ""meat"" for the hot dogs and chili. We also had several novice riders. We enjoyed with them the best meal we had in the Yosemite area. We stayed at the nearby Tenaya Lodge and this was the highlight of our visit.

In a drier winter, the falls will peak earlier (mid-April) but in a wet winter it may not be until mid to late May. The valley takes a while to explore and you will need to walk around to see the highlights of it. Allow at least 2-3 hours for a good experience in Yosemite Valley alone.

In my visits to the park, I have come to realize that mid to late April, is the best time to visit the park. Temperatures have started to warm, the snow has started to melt and the waterfalls are in they're Majesty! If you wait until mid June, the valley can get quite warm, and the waterfalls can slow to a trickle. In April, The Merced River is running high and fast, so keep an eye on your kids. Take a mixture of warm and light clothing, as the weather can change quickly. Food can be quite pricy, so I pack a lunch and some snacks. There is a lot to see, and it's not unusual to see deer and bears. A word of caution; KEEP YOUR DISTANCE from the wildlife, but enjoy the experience.There are lots of trails if you don't mind hiking and comfortable shoes are a must. The museum is also a must see. If you have the time to take the drive over Tioga Pass, it will be well worth your time. Tioga is open during the summer months only, as the elevation there is near 9,000 feet.

You enter the park and follow the Merced river, it's pretty but looks like any mountain river you have seen in any mountain range in the US. Then suddenly the valley floor opens up and you are looking at these beautiful structures like Half Dome and El Capitan. Its almost as jaw dropping as first view of the Grand Canyon. What sets the valley apart from the rest of Yosemite as well as other National Parks, is that it is park like in the conventional park sense. You can rent bicycles or rafts, take a mule ride, beach it at the river, or stroll along paved walking paths. There are food options from pizza to fine dining, and lodging from tents to fine mountain lodges.We had heard about the congestion, but we found it quite tolerable, the roads were empty enough that I could drive at 30MPH and view the scenery. It was no more crowded then at any other state or county park. Other national parks are places you visit,see, and move on.

Based on a recommendation of an older person, we went when we were still able to do hiking and it was fantastic advice.We stayed at the Yosemite View Lodge in El Portal, CA. No matter where you stay, you will probably pay more than comparable lodging far from a national park, so expect to pay a premium to stay in or near the park. That being said, we found Yosemite View Lodge to be a very comfortable, clean and quiet place to stay that was not in the actual park. It's location makes it the closest hotel to the Yosemite Valley (main attraction of the park).We had breakfast once at Degnan's Deli (in the park) and found the price ""reasonable"" but the food quality fair. We also had breakfast at the restaurant at Yosemite View Lodge. It is a breakfast buffet for roughly $10 per person. Given that you can eat all you want, this is not a bad deal at all. We also had breakfast at The Food Court - Yosemite Lodge at the Falls (in the park). The price, of course, was high, but the food was reasonably good.For lunch, we got freshly made sandwiches from Degnan's Deli in the morning before we set out for our day hike. Good quality and ""relative"" value. We also got pre-made sandwiches one morning from The Food Court and that was underwhelming. The best meal of our entire trip was lunch at the Evergreen Lodge in Groveland (on the road from the Yosemite Valley to Hetch Hetchy). Very good food and reasonably priced. If you have occasion to be on that road, it is worth planning a meal on the way.For dinner, we were usually exhausted, but had an early light dinner at the Ahwahnee. Food was good, but again overpriced. Even if you can not afford to stay at the Ahwahnee, it was fun to take a quick tour of the ground floor. A beautiful old hotel. We also ate at the pizza joint at our hotel, Parkside Pizza, which was adequate given we were exhausted from our hiking, but nothing to get to excited about. We also had a pizza at Degnan's Loft and found it to be the least favorable of all the eating establishments we visited. I guess I do not understand how it got such good reviews, but if you are staying inside the park, this may be a reasonable option if price is an issue. Frankly, I would not go back to Degnan's for anything except their fresh sandwiches to go.Enough about food. We flew into Fresno and drove a rental car up to Yosemite. We drove to Inspiration Point to a afternoon short hike. The view of the Valley from the road is great, but the hike is not that interesting and you get a worse view of the valley from the top of that trail. We got to stretch our legs, so that was good. The next morning we got up early (but not early enough, it turns out) to hike up the Mist Trail. We arrived at the park at around 8:30 am and had no problems with traffic or humanity. We hiked up to Vernal Falls (awesome) and then on to Nevada Falls (fantastic). We are quite fit, so it took us about 3 hours to get to the top of Nevada Falls. It is a hard hike. We had lunch and then continued to the base of Half Dome. You need a permit (obtained on-line) to climb Half Dome and we did not have one, so we were unable to ascend it. Given our state of exhaustion and the lateness of the day, it was just as well.Let me just insert here that you should pack a swimming suit if you are going to the park in the summer. We regretted not having our multiple times on our hikes and afterwards. There are plenty of places to take a refreshing dip. The days we were at the park, it was extremely hot, which may have been an exception, but temperatures reached at least into the high 90's.We decided to check out another area of the park on our second full day and went to Hetch Hetchy to hike to Wapana Falls at the O'Shaughnessy Dam. It was an easier hike than our previous day, which was necessary to give our bodies a chance to recover from the previous day.We came back to the main valley in mid-afternoon and hit our one and only experience with traffic jams. GO EARLY AND LEAVE LATE TO MISS THE RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC AND CRUSH OF HUMANITY.We took the ""Green Dragon"" twilight tour (6 pm) that evening which leaves from the Yosemite Lodge (in the park). A great time to take the tour in the summer since it is an open air trailer so you are not sweltering under the sun and there is more wildlife to see at this time of day. We saw deer and a bear (Yippee!). It is a good way to learn about the park history and geology.On our last day, we got into the park at 6:30 am - no traffic, not even park rangers at the entrance, and got an early start to our hike up to the top of Yosemite Falls. This is also a strenuous hike, but there is more shade on this trail and since we started much earlier, it was a cooler ascent. Great views from the top and fabulous places to take a dip in cool (cold) mountain water. Just great.To sum up, expect to pay more than you should, go early in the day to beat the crowds, try to hike as far as you are able, and enjoy this magnificent place.","July 26, 2012",Overview of our Yosemite trip,25,"Denver, CO",5
Yosemite Valley,The park is beautiful but gets very crowded over a weekend. We were there on the 30th June and 1st July and the general consensus was that it wasn't as crowded as it could get. The place is beautiful and well worth the visit. But make sure that you stay inside the valley cos otherwise the drive to get to the attractions like the falls and valley is too long. We stayed in a vacation rental in the valley so it was not much of a drive in the morning and evening when we were going to see all the attractions.,"July 26, 2012",Yosemite Valley,3,"Tempe, Arizona",4
Yosemite Valley,"I didn`t see this in the list of places that have been reviewed. It is worth while. The campground is 8,000 feet high and it is a place that a lot of the experienced campers and hikers seem to go. There are tent cabins to stay in. There are clean sheets and comforters in the cabins. The bathrooms are in a central place with showers and toilet facilities. A trip to the bathroom in the middle of the night is a challange and is much better if you bring a flashlight.  There is a restaurant that you walk down to, with breakfast in the mornings and dinner in the evenings. 2 sittings,6 and 8 pm The food is well prepared. The scenery is beautiful with the sound of the river nearby.","July 26, 2012","Touwalome Meadows Tent cabins, Yosemite",26,"Palo Alto, California",5
Yosemite Valley,"The Valley groves are very nice, as is the river. But the Village is overcrowded and overpriced, with poor (overpriced too) food, disgusting trash receptacles that are never cleaned and poorly-maintained bathrooms. The parking is next to impossible. I don't see why it is such an attraction. If you see large areas to pull over, in the Valley, then these are most likely the best spots to stop. Bring your own food or a fat wallet. Do not eat at their main cafeteria - overpriced and terrible. Eat at the deli or pizza place instead. Oh, by the way, most of the stores close at 5pm, which is lame. Avoid trying to enter the park on summer weekends from 9am-1pm.....last Sunday there was over a 2-hour wait just to get into the park (South entrance).","July 25, 2012","Some nice views, but a tourist trap",8,,3

Seeing El Capitain, Half Dome up close and personal is awe-inspiring and makes you realize what a gorgeous country we live in. We spent two days in the valley, plus driving to Mariposa Grove and Glacier Point, both in different parts of the park.

Yosemite Valley,"The first time in the valley leaves you breathless. Particularly if you are driving in from the south on hwy 41. The view after you drive through the tunnel is the perfect introduction to the valley. The valley is amazing all 4 seasons - but leaves a different impression each season so there is absolutely a need to travel every time of the year. Late spring through the middle of the summer is the time for waterfalls. Mid summer to fall is the time for camping, backpacking, biking, and all other outdoor activities imaginable. Winter is about as tranquil and peaceful as can ever be found anywhere in the world. A place to be seen over and over.Note: summer is also time for the crowds, and it is beginning to ruin the park. Highly advise picking a time that crowds won't be at their worst, or if you are there with the crowds, being smart about what hikes and activities you choose to engage in.

Yosemite Valley,"I would advise any traveler to take the tour of the park first thing in the morning. It is about $25.00 and takes two hours. If you take it later in the day during the summer it will be very hot. When you are driving into the park it could take a lot longer than the gps tells you it will take. There are detours for rock slides, one lane highways and lots of traffic!they have places to buy food but we purchased sandwiches before we left and put them in a cooler along with water. It was more convenient and saved us quite a bit of money.If you do not want to pay the high prices in the park and do not mind an hour drive, you may want to stay in one of the towns surrounding the park. We stayed at Mariposa and enjoyed it.FILL YOUR TANK BEFORE YOU GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE PARK.

Yosemite Valley,"It is just amazing that this place exists in this world. We have been there 3 times in the past 4 years and find it more amazing every time we go back. Great nature programs, see the movies they offer in the Village Nature Center. I do love seeing how people spend lots of money last minute on state of the art hiking shoes, back packs, hats, stupid walking sticks that look like ski poles, and those stupid hiking vests. If you are not going to climb rocks and be adventurous, don't waste your money. If you are like us, we climb rocks, wade in streams, get dirty and walk off the trails, then all you need is a good pair of hiking shoes. Merrill's are perfect and at Dicks for decent prices. Keen makes like a sandal type hiker for kids which work great. We also take one of those cheap draw string back packs with a few water bottles and maybe a snack, that's all ya need for a good day of walking. The 3 shopping/gift shops have anything from firewood, marshmallows, salsa, souvenirs, produce etc., and they don't rape you on the price. They even have a great selection of beer wine and liquor. Who doesn't need a cold one after a long hike in the mountains. The food at the restaurants around is a bit pricey, but in a pinch, worth it. The only thing I found amazing is the effort and money they pour in to keep bears away. They spend thousands of $$ on special trash cans, Metal Hurricane proof food containers and awareness measures and yet we never see a bear. One Ranger said he's been there since March and hasn't seen one yet. We went to a ranger fireside talk one night and I asked how many people have been attacked or killed by a bear at Yosemite, and he said Zero. I was shocked. Not to sound sick or nothing, but I would think there was another reason to keep them away other than them stealing our food. Anyway, amazing waterfalls, and the night hikes are fun and very peaceful. I recommend a hike to lower Yosemite falls (climb the rocks beyond the walking path) and taking the cold plunge in the lower falls pool. My wife,3 kids and I did it. Heart Pumping Cold but great memory! We stayed at one of the Yosemite lodges there. a bit rustic, but clean sheets, nice shower, hair dryer, soap and shampoo provided, Small fridge and a TV (which never got turned on). Worth staying in the park rather than driving winding roads back and forth out of the park to stay. All in all, great trip, awesome smells of the wilderness, and well managed.

They would be much better off running it like Disney with huge parking lots outside the park for day trippers with trams taking them into the valley.Upside because of all the people the food is MUCH better than any other national park. The walkways and paths are smooth and easy to navigate for older folks. They have the nicest and cleanest bathrooms of any national park. The campgrounds even have a pool.

We entered the park from the east at Lee Vining on on Route 395 at the park entrance on Route 120. The first few miles will get your blood flowing with no guardrails approaching Tioga Pass at 9,945 feet. But take heart, after that the park has easy roads through beautiful wooded areas and vista points of interest to stop off for photos. IMPORTANT: If you are a senior you can save hundreds of dollars at National Parks. Some of the entrance fees are pricey at $20 to $50 dollars. At one park a few years ago, the ranger said as seniors we were entitled to a FREE Lifetime pass for ourselves and our car. We didn't think much of it but were happy to receive something for free. Now that we have been traveling the U.S. and stopping off at National Parks, we have saved many hundreds of dollars. The pass has been accepted at EVERY National Park. Make sure to enquire at the ranger station on go online at the National Park Service.

Yosemite Valley,"We drove four hours round-trip from Fresno just to spend 3 hours in Yosemite Valley.....been there before, but can never get enough. The drive is slow and torturous since you routinely get stuck behind RVs and slow cars and get hammered in road construction. It takes about 60-90 minutes from Fresno, depending on traffic. Once inside the park, it takes about an hour to get down to Yosemite Village. There are never enough hours for us. The falls were running slow due to lack of water, but they were still spectacular as the winds created some awesome spray. I do not think that there is a more beautiful place on earth.

The visit to the Mariposa Grove was a pain in the neck because of a general lack of parking, but the gigantic trees are well worth it. The drives up to Glacier Point and Hetch Hetchy can be tiresome (winding mountain roads) but the end result is well worth it. The Tioga road to Toulumne Meadows and multiple lakes (Lake Tenaya- beautiful in the mornings!) is not to be missed. In the valley itself, use the shuttles to get around to various trails and hikes.

Yosemite Valley,"My teens were not enthusiastic about visiting Yosemite, but I was eager to experience it so we came up with a compromise plan that would serve plenty of families well. -If your time is limited (we were there less than 24 hours) stay in Yosemite or right outside. We stayed at the Yosemite View Lodge right outside the park entrance. -Get up early (if you are visiting during peak season). We were at our first stop Bridalveil Falls at about 7:30. We had it to ourselves.-Plan a route with minimal backtracking. We headed from Bridalveil to Glacier Point. Didn't have the hassle of getting behind slow moving vehicles and experienced very few crowds. -Get into the valley before 10 am (or you will spend your visit looking for a parking spot). Use the Shuttle. If you are confused about where things are the drivers are super helpful.-Consider doing the Vernal Falls hike as soon as you get in the Valley as it will be your toughest hike of a day visit (.8 pretty much all up hill -- obviously the teens had no trouble. Mom was reminded that she needs to hit the gym more). We did not continue on to the Mist Trail. -We also walked (it's not really a hike) to the Lower Yosemite Falls and dawdled over the beautiful view.-By getting to the park early, we ate at the Food Court early (again no crowds) and headed out of the park at the point where parking was very difficult and the heat on the Valley floor was climbing. Our visit took about 6.5 hours-One additional note -- had we planned better we would have hit the Mariposa Grove the evening we arrived before going to dinner, or done the Mirror Lake hike. -If you have more time, I'd recommend renting a bike to ride through the valley, or renting a raft.

We arrived at the campground, Dimond O just outside Yosemite in the Stanislaus forest, about 1700 and there was no one around the host area. We decided to drive round the site to find our previous booking found it and started unloading. Now on the booking, online it is a disabled pitch but there are 4 steps down to the pad?? We had a lot of trees around the site and well shaded with the double bear box in a corner. This is as far as praise goes, there is no wash area, washing up area or even a sink and no showers. There is a stand pipe which tells people not to wash, wash up or clean fish around it!! The toilets are composting toilets, which have so far not been a problem, but these were terrible they really did stink bad and at times we were retching whilst using them. The site host I assume did walk around the site but no one came and introduced themselves as such which after 6 other where sites they had done. I would never go back to this campsite at all and I have been to some places I thought where bad until this one! Meanwhile the Yosemite valley day trips we had were beautiful, a little crowded as the children had just broken for summer vacation. We hiked out of Toulumne meadows, did a day hike along Hetch Hetchy to the 2 waterfalls butterflies all around us plus lots of other driving visits.

It is possible to do so, but it is a long day (about 10 hours) Others chose to ride horses or bikes through the valley views, absorbing this location in a slower and more thorough way. We drove around the valley, out to Glacier Point and then walked through the Mariposa Pines with the giant sequoias. (Taking the slightly longer route through the pines means much less foot traffic and almost a solo expedition, especially in the late afternoon, when the light is splendid). Each of these spots was beautiful and worth the drive. But be forewarned, there is a good deal of driving, perhaps 150 miles in that one day, and many of the roads are quite twisting and slow at times.

Yosemite Valley,"The park exceded our expectations. The tram ride through the sequoias was well worth the price. Of course the scenery is breathtaking. We found parking at attractions to be limited but adequate for this time of year. Restrooms were few and far between and I can only imagine what it is like when the park is busy. We stopped in the Visitor's Center to get some advise and directions from the ranger. On past visits to Yellowstone, and other National Parks we have found park rangers very helpful. Not so here. It would have been helpful to have the shuttle bus system explained in the brochure you are handed at the gate instead of when you get on the bus. It would also be helpful to have information about bike and raft rentals including rates, in this brochure. We would have loved to rent a raft but did not know this was a possibility until late in our stay. That's a little late to plan your route. If we were to go back I would plan earlier and stay in the park. My advise to visitors would be to talk to other people who have visited the park and get ideas from them. Read reviews and anything you can find on the web. It's hard to pack everything into 2 days. Three or four days would have been better.","June 30, 2012",Yosemite,0,"Mountain Top, Pennsylvania",5

Yosemite Valley,"We had a plan of attack for Yosemite. As 50 year olds, we wanted to cram in as much as possible in two full days without bodily damage. We are not hiking athletes, so strenuous expeditions were not on our radar (except for our third day, dedicated to hiking Half Dome). We stayed at the first hotel outside of the park entrance, the Yosemite View Lodge in El Portal. It was convenient, clean, and only a 15 minute morning drive from Yosemite Village. Our visit was on a Monday through Wednesday, we wanted to avoid the weekend.Here's what we did. The first day we drove into the park by 7AM and claimed a parking space in Yosemite Village, near the bicycle rentals. Parking lots fill up by 9 AM. The park was peaceful and quiet, with very few people and empty roads. We enjoyed a short and easy hike to the Lower Yosemite Falls, located here. We then rented bicycles (they opened at 8:30AM in June).Renting park bicycles was the best thing we did. In one day we had quick access to the lodges, dining, information centers, meadows, and several easy day hikes including Lower Yosemite Falls, Mirror Lake and others. It is mostly a level ride on the valley floor. If you are spending one or a few days in the area, the bikes are a great way to get a sense of the park layout. We rented two bikes for $60 for the day's duration. They were not due back until 8PM. It was almost 10 hours of freedom, with the ability to get back to the car to regroup or modify our packs.We were able to make our way around the park easily, and get so many things done in twelve hours, that we were able to relax in the meadow below El Capitan at dusk. We watched the cliff climbers with our binoculars. Our second day we did the driving loop from El Portal to Mariposa for breakfast at the Happy Burger Diner (great), then back to the sout Yosemite Park entrance, stopping at the Mariposa Forest. This allowed us to enter the park through the Tunnel View for it's glorious vista of Yosemite.This gave us time to regroup at our El Portal hotel and pack a cooler for another dusk picnic in the meadow below El Capitan.","June 30, 2012",A plan for seeing the most in two days.,84,"Wyoming, Michigan",5

The only gripe was we went July 4th weekend a few years ago and everything was packed, people lining up and hard to find car parking.Having said that, the views were worth all the waiting, the staff were friendly and helpful. We took time to jump in a stream for a cooling down swim, which was excellent at the time. Along with a bunch of other lucky tourists, we got to see a bear strolling through the forest and Park staff were having controlled burn offs so that added a kinda surreal element to all the days activities. An iconic environment that you have to do at least once in your life time...take the kids or just get away from it all...highly recommended to anyone with a yearning for the great outdooors.","June 29, 2012",Yosemite National Park....avoid on July 4th,32,"Santa Barbara, California",5

If I had to offer advice, plan on getting there early because parking is limited. The shuttle bus system works well. And remember, this is mountain driving to get to the valley floor ... what may take a short time as the crow flies will likely take you much longer.

On 6/23/12 we got STUCK in bumper to bumper traffic for 70 minutes while we attempted to park and hike to Mirror Lake. Once you are stuck in traffic around the Curry Village, there isn't a way to get out of it. You just have to sit in traffic until you can make your way around past Yosemite Village.

Yosemite Valley,"The Valley is iconic; you will want to see it, of course. But unless you are staying there in the lodge, village or campgrounds it doesn't have to be the first place you go or spend the most time. On this trip I only had two days and was staying in Mariposa on the park's south side. My inn hosts recommended I enter the south portal and go to Mariposa Grove for the sequoias. Get there early as parking fills fast. There are shuttles from Wawona if parking is filled. The grove will take 1-3 hours depending on how high you want to hike. It is awesome and must-see. Next drive out Glacier Point road for the most spectacular views in the park: Washburn and Glacier Points. From these you can everything you came to see: the Valley below, all of the falls, Half Dome, the High Sierras beyond. If you like vistas, there are none better. On your way back you can choose from several trails to hike of varying difficulty. If it says strenuous, believe it. If you are not equipped to hike, wait til you get to the valley where the walks are easier and bike trails are paved. That said, it was in the Valley that I saw a bear on a paved trail! I guess they like easy, too. My point is that unless you are staying in the Valley, you need not spend a whole day here if your stay is short. If you have all week, have at it.

Be sure to visit the Mariposa Grove of giant Sequoia trees and walk or ride the tram to upper grove and then walk down. These astounding trees only live in a small range and can only be seen in a few places.Be aware that the Valley floor can be quite hot in the summer.

Pete’s knowledge of the area was extensive and he went out of his way to show us things of interest which were not necessarily on the itinerary – like watching climbers on the sheer walls of El Capitan and later showing us a video which made what we had seen more meaningful. Pete’s driving skills were frequently in evidence, and having a bus/coach with a toilet on board was definitely a bonus.

Tip: please be responsible and sensible when driving on the roads. The curves and ledges are real. Not many railings or guards.  Please be smart, and respect mother nature.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite is so big and full of attractions I'll only speak of one here. We'd been to yosemite before but never heard of or saw the Hetch Hetchy dam. This time we only had one full day in the park and wanted to see something different. My wife saw on the map it looked like an out of the way place and suggested we go there and bypass all the overcrowded attractions.All we can say is WOW! The road to the dam is quite interesting and scenic, breathtaking, etc. You do not want to be sleepy or drunk on this road or texting for sure!The dam itself is massive and a sight to see. We could see the Wapama falls in the distance and knew we had to do the 2.5 mi hike (5mi round trip) to see them even though it was starting to spit rain. Walked across the dam and right into a long lighted tunnel cut through the granite. the hike to the falls was fairly easy and we saw some older folks in their 70s doing it. Of course they were in pretty good physical condition so its not that easy but not bad if you take your time. Once to the falls it is nothing short of spectacular and we immediatley wondered why we had never heard of it. During the hike the sharply rising canyon walls make you feel like you're in some foreign place. We talked to another group and one guy said he'd been to Yosemite 10 times but no one ever suggested coming to Hetch Hetchy so we didn't feel so bad. He was also astounded at the beauty and size of the falls as we were. These falls drop about 1100 feet! Yes thats not a typo. Theres a walkway that the water cascades under most of the time but in spring the walkway can't be crossed due to high water, or so we were told.By the time we got back to the falls it was raining steady and we were getting wet even though we had rain coats but that didn't detract one bit. this place is a must see. you will not be disappointed. As with most falls the amount of water probably varies with the time of year.This turned out to be an unexpected highlight of our 10 day trip in CA. We will come back here next trip to Yosemite.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is unbelievable in beauty and grandeur. We hiked to all of the popular falls and enjoyed them all. We were so tired every day that we slept great. We stayed in the park one night at Yosemite Lodge and two nights just outside the park. Better to be in the park if possible just for the convenience of not having to drive and park for the day. We especially enjoyed the hike up to Upper Yosemite Falls. When the tour books and maps say ""very strenuouse"", believe them! However, if you can take the strain, this is a hike not to be missed. We had lunch while sitting on the hiking trail about 2000 ft above the valley with a light spray of the falls hitting us. It was a magnificent spot to catch our breath and relax before making the push to the top. These hikes are potentially dangerous if you don't watch where you step. We also did hikes to Bridal Veil, El Capitan, Vernal Fall and Nevada Fall. All worth seeing. We enjoyed the Mist Trail to Vernal and Nevada Falls a lot. Definitely recommend getting to the park on the early side in the morning to get best (any) parking spots and getting a jump on other day hikers.

Yosemite Valley,"We planned this trip for several months. Did some research on places to stay, rental car rates, places to see, what to bring, maps, what to do on each day we are there, and etc. Booked a four night stay at Yosemite Four Seasons Vacation Rentals. Its inside the park but not inside the valley. Takes about an hour drive to the valley, not too bad since we get to stop at different attractions. (I have a different review about the hotel under Yoseminte Four Seasons Vacation Rentals). The rental car reservation was made thru Costco Travel. Did it early so the rate was high but was able to make several and drop the ones that were too pricey. Ended up with a good deal with Alamo @ around $162.00 for 8 days. Just keep checking on the prices. Was worry about the road condition because Yosemite's website (http://www.nps.gov/yose/index.htm) mentioned about tire chain. Never use it before. Did research and found the different type of chains you can use and how to put them on tires. Youtube has videos on how to put them on. The week before we leave on our trip I call the Ranger station to ask about Half Dome permit and tire chain. Found tire chains are not needed. And as far as the Half Dome permit, well, we didn't know we permit to climb till I found something on the website. Apparently you need to apply for it a few months earlier during a open period for permits. But the permit thing didn't bother us too much since the cable wasn't even up yet and not going to be till May 25, the date after we leave Yosemite.Knowing we will arrive late in Yosemite and knowing there won't be a market nearby, on the day we start driving to Yosemite we stop by 99 Ranch Market on Spring Mountain Road and bought some pakage meat, bread, bottle water, some fruits, even a bottle of wine. Also got some pastry from a bake shop in the same complex. We already brought along lots of snacks from home. So, we have enough for the road and the whole stay in Yosemite. We were ready. Since the rental car is already filled up, we didn't have to worry about gas for a while. I mapped out the route thru Google Maps and it says it will take about 8 hours, over 400 miles to get to our destination. Using my Verizon Droid, I input the hotels address and it mapped out the routes for me. Yosemite, here we come.We took turn to drive. My wife is not used to high speed driving, I usually do the driving but because it was such a long drive. She has to drive so I can take a breather. She did much better than I thought. Just a few instances when she had to pass a slow vehicle or trailer, she got nervous. But overall she did good. The only other thing about driiving is think about gas. I mean gas for your car. Fill up when you can outside the park. You will pay a dollar or more per gallon inside the park. Also, think about how much more driving you need based on how much gas you have left in your tank. You don't want to have a empty tank in the middle of nowhere even before arriving at the park. So keep that in mind. And also there are times you will be driving a long time without seeing any rest stop for restroom. Remember, I am driving from Vegas to Yosemite, for the first time. I am worry about gas, restroom, something may happen in the middle of nowhere. But it proof I worry too much.The GPS was suprisingly good all the way to the hotel in Yosemite. But once inside the park, I got no signal. On the way back I have to wait till we are outside the park to use it.Here's a breakdown of what we did on the 3 whole days we were at the park (on the night before we make sure we pack lunch and snacks and drink ready):-Day 1: visitor center, this is a must if you need maps and have questions. On the way to visitor center we did a short hike to see Bridalveil fall. After lunch, we drove to Hetch Hetchy. This is one place I didn't care too much about, the drive was long, you just go there to see the reservoir and maybe some hiking if you have time. But the best thing out of this drive was seeing a bear on the road coming back. The thing was in front of us after I made a turn so I stop and pull out my camera and start recording. That was the first big animal we saw and the only time during the trip we saw a bear. Now it was all good.- Day 2: Mariposa Grove and Glacier Point. Parking for Mariposa Grove can be a headache. If you can park your car outside by the golf course and catch the 15 minutes shuttle to the grove. This could save you time driving there and be told by the ranger you have to turn around and catch the shuttle because the parking lot is full. The walk/hike to see those sequoia was a good workout. Bring water and snacks. Depending on how much walking you want to, you can spend half a day here. Also they do have tour on a trailer like 'bus' where you pay, I think $25 for it. It stops over place but you don't get to hike anywhere. I guess its good for people who couldn't walk much. Glacier point was magnificent. You get to see the Yosemite valley below, half dome in the distant. This is a must go to place in Yosemite. Very nice view. Pictures, pictures, pictures.- Day 3: we decided to hike Vernal fall and Neveda fall. Wasn't sure if we could make it to the sub dome. Half Dome wasn't open because the cables are not up and we didn't have a permit. This is the infamous mist trail. Lots of accidents happen on the mist trail. And I found out why. Not that any of us got hurt, but the hike to Vernal fall, aka mist trail, was wet and steep. I cannot believe when I read about people wearing flip flop hiking this trail, Its like suicide. Once slip you are going down hill and bring along people behind you. I doubt you will break just a nail. Do bring a raincoat if you don't want to get wet. Although once you passed the 'mist' and reach the top of Vernal fall, you have a great place to soak in the view and rest. Giving that its summer, you'll dry up in no time. Top of vernal fall is a good place to snack and rest a bit before going on to Nevada all. I have to also mention that the hike is not for people out of shape or have breathing problem. On the way we saw people going up with no water, carrying nothing. Big mistake. You will get thirsty and hungry if you hike all the way up to the falls. There is a restroom near the top of Vernal fall. Didn't see one at the top of Nevada fall. Continue on to Nevada wall. The hike was much 'safer' going up this second fall. Mostly rocks but dry. Once you are up at the fall, the view was breaktaking. There is a big wide empty area for lunch and resting. Many folks were having lunch there, including us. We rested about 30 minutes and went on the John Miur trail which is the other trail going down. Its a much more scenic trail and safer trail to go back down than the mist trail. The total hike took about 5 hours. Didn't make it to the subdome. Our legs were burning by the time we were at Nevada fall. That night we were back at the hotel, our legs were screeming for relieve. We knew than we were out of shape despite the regular walking and weight training we do. I think a good way to prepare you for the hike as far as conditing is concern is to do runing or hit the eliptical machine. Think about it. Hiking uphill for about 2 hours. How would you prepare for that. This is not to say that regular folks cannot do it. You just take more rest stops along the way. Bring water and snacks/lunch.We were glad we did Mariposa Grove first then the falls. If it was the opposite, we would hike all the way up to see the Grove museum.All and all, the trip was great. And the best part for me was we also get to spend a few days in Vegas afterward doing some R&R.","May 31, 2012",Long drive from Vegas to Yoseminte but worth it,38,"Honolulu, Hawaii",5

But the end was worth it - the very large waterfall. The park amazed us with how clean it is, we never saw one piece of paper or any type of trash anywhere.

Yosemite Valley,"I was surprised to see that Yosemite had so many water falls. The month of May is the best time to view these falls since the water flow slows down or ends after May. My favorite spot was Glacier Point. The road is full of curves and you have to be careful. However, the views of the park are spectacular and worth the drive. I have been to most of the National Parks in the West and I would have to rate Yosemite as one of the best. We did not take the Tioga Road since the distance was to great. I would suggest spending 2 or 3 days unless you want to do any hiking. The biggest draw back is the restroom facilities. They are pit toilets and were not very clean. Also there is a lot of driving involved since most rooms are located outside of the park. Still it is worth the time of visit this park. We were there the 8th of May and left the 11th of May.

Yosemite Valley,"Ansel Adams used his photography to describe the Yosemite Valley - a wise choice since words are totally inadequate. It is truly a magical place where the landscape is breathtaking and the light changes every minute of the day. Any photographer should plan to spend - at a minimum - one full day at the park, from sunrise to sunset to capture the essence of this place. Realistically, a visit of several days to a week is needed to do a complete portrait of Yosemite. The park has some of the best preserved alpine glacial features in the world and should be on the 'bucket list' of everyone interested in earth science. Unfortunately, since it is on the 'bucket list' of so many people, the crowds can be quite overwhelming at many of the most popular view points - so much so that it is difficult to get a good photograph without hordes of people in the foreground. Regardless, brave the crowds, it is definitely worth the trip.","May 19, 2012",A Photographer's Paradise,31,"Austin, Texas",5

Yosemite Valley,"After visiting Zion National Park, Bryce and Grand Canyons, Yosemite was the last on our tour. And we left the best until last. We had our 5 month old son with us and we were touring in an RV (large camper van).We had pre-booked our space in Yosemite (Upper Falls) so that even when we arrived a little later than expected after stopping at Tuolomne Meadows, Lake Tenaya and El Capitan and taking our time over lunch we still had no problem registering and parking. We came in from the Eastern side along the beautiful Tioga Pass and had the most fantastic views. We took most of the day doing this and we are glad we did.The area is well serviced with showers and loos (if you didn't want to use the ones in your van) and there are several restaurants and shops to stock-up. My wife felt very comfortable and safe within the park and, during September at least, the place wasn't rammed with tourists.We all enjoyed a 4-hour hike up Illouette waterfall (son in a rucksack) and there were more strenuous walks for me to do as well. I hiked up to between Upper and Lower Yosemite Falls and watched the sunrise. I was the only there and it felt like that was my own personal sunrise as the light was cast past Half-Dome and across the valley.We also made a small effort to drive up to Sentinel Dome to watch the sunset and that effort was more than rewarded with a fantastic view, amazing skies and nice people to enjoy it with. It did also mean that we caught another view, this time along the valley from where most of the photos are taken.All-in-all I couldn't rate this place any higher. From what we can tell, September was an ideal month to visit. All the kids are back to school yet the weather was warm enough to wear shorts and t-shirts.","May 11, 2012",September was superb in Yosemite,25,"London, United Kingdom",5

The guy in the station told us it was only 40 min. from there down to Curry Village. Two hours later we were in one of the major parking lots near Yosemite Village. Yes, if we'd not stopped to take pictures it may have only taken 40 min...maybe more like 60 due to all the curves and mountain driving at slower speed, but really how could we keep on driving and not pull over for photos? Two hours was more like it, since we were over come so many times with amazing views that we had to stop and click off a few not knowing just around the bend was an even more amazing view. Once in the valley we found a deli to eat at and had some good sandwiches and great sweet potato frys before checking out a couple of shops and mailing off some postcards.

Yosemite Valley,"In my quest to visit as many National Parks as I can, or at least the big ones, Yosemite has been on my list for a while. But I did not want to deal with a summer visit, as I've heard it is a zoo and you have to reserve so far in advance. So we went for spring break, which was a great introduction. We drove right in, no reservation, and booked a tent-cabin (there are hundreds of them!) in the Village. One campground was closed and the other was full, however, so we couldn't have camped if we wanted to. The waterfalls were stunning and we had beautiful weather. But the place was still busy even with a third of the typical summer season's visitors. Trams were full (bring your bikes! the rental prices are not encouraging) and we had plenty of company on the hiking trails. I can't imagine what it would be like in the summer, but now that we have been to the Valley, we will not need to go back. Next time we'll stay in a less-traveled area, like Tuolomne Meadows or Hetch-Hetchy, which were still closed for snow in the spring. The setting at Yosemite is breathtaking but with regards to amenities it is unlike any other park I've been to. Yosemite Village is a town in its own right, with housing and grocery and post office for year-round residents. We watched a little league game played by residents' kids! Curry Village, where visitors stay, is a lot like summer camp, with rows and rows of tent-cabins; if you go in spring, pay extra for the heated ones or bring your own 4-season sleeping bags! You'll need your earplugs - I could hear the guy snoring in the next tent. The on-site food was marginal at best, and got ""old"" after a couple days. Bring your cooler or your pocketbook so you can spring for a fancy meal at the Lodge (not in our budget). Definitely go out late dusk and stand on the boardwalk in the middle of the Valley. While others were lounging in the Wi-Fi cabin, I had the night to myself, surrounded by granite. Wow!","May 7, 2012",Yosemiteland,18,"Seattle, Washington",3

Sentinel Beach is bigger, so we found a secluded little spot and enjoyed our picnic. The first day we saw deers, coyotes and a bear! The bear was near Sentinel Bridge and people with kids were running up to it to take photos. We watched from a distance.","May 6, 2012","Beautiful, scenic and uncrowded!!",22,So. California,5

Then, I hope to wake up in the morning, eat a quick breakfast, then walk to the Vernal Falls trailhead. Hitting the trailhead early will help you avoid the crowds on this extremely popular hike. My daughter and I made it to the trailhead at 8:15am and there weren't that many hikers we encountered on the way to the top of Vernal Falls. We headed down from the top at about 10:00am and there was a steady stream of people all the way down. I was glad we hit the trailhead as early as we did, and even earlier would have been good.

When we visited in the winter it was snowing, big clumpy wet flakes, it made the valley a peaceful vista of white. The other great part about visiting in winter is the waterfalls - February is rainy season on the west coast so nearly every waterfall was flowing. And I was lucky last spring, it was a particularly wet year so even some waterfalls that are dry by late May were still flowing. Of course Half Dome and El Capitan are gorgeous too.

Most of the valley bike paths are flat and very ride-able. This more recent trip (March 2012) was wonderful!! We arrived at Yosemite the day after a huge snowfall and even though we had to buy tire chains to enter the park, it was worth it. Seeing these lovelly views in snow was amazing. Another perk - very few people around so it was a treat to see the park without the crowd. If you can go at an off season time i would recommend it. I would love to go in the fall one day.

Travel into and out of the park is via a 2-lane road, with lots of turn-offs for stopping / viewing / photo shots / hiking, and takes a full hour to get to the valley floor. Once on the floor, there are large parking lots (which fill up) with plenty of bus service to take you where you want to go. If you are not staying in the park, go early (no later than 9am) to the park entrance because the traffic can get bad. The traffic moves but many times there are no parking spots to stop and get out, especially later in the day so go early. Hiking trails are extensive and many can be completed in under 30 minutes. There are several trails that take a fully day (both going up and coming back down) so if this is your desire, plan accordingly and take lots of water / energy bars with you.A visit to the park can be completed in about two days if you visit all the park has to offer. Waterfalls, which come from the snow melt at higher elevations, can dry up in the late summer months so plant your trip accordingly. Overall, Yosemite is one of the most beautiful national parks we've seen and we'll go again if we ever find ourselves in this area.","December 24, 2011","Breathtaking vistas, waterfalls, rock formations.

Yosemite Valley,My husband and I stayed in San Francisco in August. We decided to do a day trip to Yosemite. All I knew about it was that I would see some Giant Redwoods. We did it with Extranomical tours. They picked us up from the hotel and our guide was very good. It took about 3 hours to get to Yosemite. We went to the Giant Sequoia Grove first then on to Yosemite Valley. I would recommend going during the week as it's not as busy as the weekend. When I first saw the view of the valley floor I was totally blown away. It is spectacular. From the viewpoint the valley floor stretches out ahead of you. El Capitan (the tallest mountain there) is one side with Half Dome in the distance. We got a chance to go to one of the hotels for food and then was allowed to have a wander. My husband and I decided to go to the river to dip our feet in. We were told to watch out for black bears but we didn't see any (although someone in the party did). The guide on the way there and did give us interesting information about places as we were passing through but it was a good mixture of being informative and letting us rest.

Well worth the drive time.At stop 6 or 7 is lower falls trail. The trail splits--take the left it is the best view of the Falls. I got this tip from Trip Advisor and it was so right.

Yosemite Valley,"We purposely traveled in October in order to miss all the crowds. The park was still busy but comfortablly so. I recommend starting to the park early. Unless you stay in the park, you'll have to drive into the park which could take 45 mins to an hour. Our family had two teenagers and 11 year old, so we planned short, but challenging hikes to Yosemite Falls, the BrideVeil Falls, and to Vernal Falls. Each hike took 2-3 hours. If it is a clear day, drive up to Glacier Point. Be sure to stop at the tunnel and take a photo as well. Up at Glacier Point, I highly recommend hiking up to Sentinnel Dome. At the south end of the park be sure to visit the Mariposa Grove. There is a 3 mile round trip hike up to a small museum where you'll pass lots of great photo opportunities. It will simply amaze you! My advice, plan your visit around the ability of your family. Stop in and see the great hotel down in the valley. Its expensive but beautiful!","November 19, 2011",Great Family Desitination,105,North Central Indiana,5

Then I drove out in my rental car and stopped to see things I had passed. The bus also went places I could not drive in a private car. What a beautiful place.

We took the trail along Northside Drive from Lower Yosemite Falls to El Capitan. The trail crosses the road and goes into the meadow in the middle of the valley. It then comes back to the road at the bridge. You are pretty near the road most of the way on this side. We stopped for an hour or so for lunch and swam in the freezing cold Merced River near the El Capitan Bridge. We then took the trail back along Southside Drive, the trail is pretty hidden from the road going this way. We came out at the trail head for the Four Mile Trail and crossed the street to the Swinging Bride where we jumped in the Merced River again to cool off! We then took the shuttle at Yosemite Lodge back to Curry Village.

Yosemite Valley,"In mid-summer, if you arrive at the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center by 8:30 to 9:00, you should score a parking spot. Also, arrive early to avoid the c-r-u-s-h of visitors that develops at sites by mid-day and in order to be able to snag a seat (most times) on the shuttle buses. Be prepared to have to wait for shuttles and/or to stand on them from late morning on. It would be nice if the NPS restricted vehicular traffic during high visitor periods, thus making the Yosemite experience more tranquil, quiet, and connected to nature. Restricting vehicular traffic from the roads would also allow bicyclists more free rein of them.

The ride is easy and I felt like I was in heaven. The bike paths are very well maintained. If you bring your bikes from home you can ride all the way down to Bridalveil or Tunnel View.

We have been to many places in the Rockies and Canadian Rockies that are much more impressive.Maybe this would have been much more impressive if the Parks Department had left it the way John Muir and the other early explorers saw it. But NO, the parks department decided to re-forest the majority of the valley that used to be meadows back in John Muir's day. The forest destroys many of the sight lines that use to exist.I can't help to wonder what Muir would think of what has become of his park?Go to Yosemite for the views from Glacier point, Tunnel View, and of course the Sequoia groves, and leave the valley alone.

Yosemite Valley,"I did the day trip from San Francisco with Extranomical Tours. Megan was outside our hotel bang on time at 6am, but it was another 3 pick up stops and lots of wasted time before she came across fellow travellers.Whilst these individuals had to find their own way to the final pick up, it really gets my hackles up when I lose time because of idiots - at the end of the day, we could have had half an hour more at another stop.Back to the tour, Yosemite is wonderful - the secenery reminded me of Norway and I'm sure in winter the similarities would have been enhanced.We did a very early supermarket stop for lunch - I found this frustrating - it was difficult to purchase anything simple like a sandwich or a filled roll - they were available but the queues were crazy as everything was made to order. Great for the supermarket, but by the time we purchased a buns and fillings it was a really expensive stop. I think Extranomical could do better for the clients.Things could only get better and they did. We stopped and had the choice to walk the 2 mile return trip to the Tuolumne Sequoia Grove - what mighty giants they were. We were told it was for average fitness, but in the heat my above fitness level really struggled on the return mile - it was extremely steap and I was thankful for any shady patches. I thought a little more emphasis should be placed on the uphill journey as we had some elderly folk really struggle.The scenery was lovely, but it was disappointing that because we were a ""bus"" (just a little one I might add) we were not allowed to stop at some of the best photo stops on the way down into the Valley.I valued our free time in the valley - we had several hours to go off and do our own thing which was great. The Yosemite Waterfall is a must visit, especially on a hot day - position yourself right and you'll find the spray very refreshing.Don't be fooled when touring ex San Francisco, you don't get far before there is a huge temperature change - if its spring/summer and your thinking jeans, I suggest, you put the shorts/dress in the day pack.Well worth the long day and thumbs up to Extranomical Tours.I","October 1, 2011",Yosemite National Park Day Trip,355,"Wellington, New Zealand",5
Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley would be an awesome place to visit out of season when it isn't packed with people. Although the park service does have shuttle buses that run every 10-15 minutes during peak summer hours, many times buses were full and so you might have to wait at a stop for a half an hour or more for a bus with an empty seat or space. Even though we were a little disappointed with the crowds, it still was worthwhile to stop at the main vistor's center, hike past Yosemite Falls, and see El Capitan from up close. You will need to spend an entire day here to make the Valley experience worthwhile.Due to the crowds, my favorite parts of the park were actually areas we vistied outside of the valley itself. Don't miss taking the time to visit Glacier Point...this give the best overall view (and pictures) of the entire valley. If you want to get a good look at Half Dome this is the spot.

Yosemite National Park is a special place and the Yosemite Valley really does justify 2 days minimum for visitors if you can spare it.

If, on the other hand, you get stuck in gridlock on a mid-summer day with too many clueless tourists, you will wish you had gone to a more remote place. Way too many people for this small valley.

Yosemite Valley,"My boyfriend and I had booked a trip to Yosemite. At the time of the booking we didn't have a dog, but we both work in foster and an urgent need happened so we ended up with a dog around our vacation time. We tried to cancel but were told we couldn't get our money back, so we booked a kennel and headed out. The kennel(if you want to call t thatit) was covered in feces. The dogs weren't being watched or taken care of. I arrived at eight in the morning to pick up my dog and she hadn't been walked or fed. I deceided not to bring her back.  I was told that dogs were not really welcome because of the mess and the noise.Well the last time I checked the bears didn't pick up their poop, and my dog was a lot more quiet than some of the ill mannered children running free all over the parkOne would think with California being so animal friendly, that the park would cut familes some slack.

Yosemite Valley,"Took a tour with Incredible Adventures from San Francisco and loved it. The driver and tour guide, Tim, was amazing, friendly and very knowledgeable.We stayed for a night in the Cedar Lodge which was ""ok"" and that was it. We are alittle spoiled and like our nice high thread count sheets etc. which way far from the case here. I was alttle grossed out by the 1970's bed spread and 200 thread count scratchy sheets and old carpeting but we survived. We booked one month before we went and were told all the higher end accomadations in the park are booked for the next 2 to 3 years!! Wow, too bad we just decided to go in May so we took what we could get. Yosemite is beautiful and a must see.. One word of caution, when the sign says NOT to go any further or do not stand on the rocks DON""T DO IT.

Yosemite Valley,"The beauty of this park was astounding. But the crowds of people really took away from the experience of being there. I would give this park an excellent rating, but for the crowds. It was crowded everywhere, Curry Village, shuttle buses, restaurants, bathroom, trails, lookouts, roads. We were caught in an hour traffic jam on Saturday afternoon on our way back to Curry Village from Glacier Point. We ended up leaving that afternoon. The crowds were horrible!","July 27, 2011",See this park - but not in July and definately not on the weekend!,27,"Groton, Massachusetts",4
Yosemite Valley,"I should have known better, but I was tempted by a pair of permits for the Half Dome cables. Yosemite is a stunning location, but the valley floor is ruined by too many people, and too many cars. The park service makes it worse by managing the traffic so poorly. I knew it would be bad, but we waited in line for 90 minutes to enter the park. While there were 2 booths at the El Portal entrance, only one was staffed. From there it took another hour to get to the first open parking spot, near Housekeeping Camp. We spent the afternoon walking around the valley floor, and finished up at the Ahwahnee for a light dinner. We though we'd try to take the shuttle back to our car, even though it wasn't very direct, and had 2 successive shuttles take us a few stops down the route go out of service and dump all the passengers unceremoniously. We spent an hour on the shuttle(s), and wound up 1/8 mile from where we started. We walked back to the car. Now the shuttles only run until 10 PM. It was high season, the park was awash with people, and it doesn't get dark until almost 8:30. Why take the shuttles off line at 7:00? They weren't changing drivers. The shuttle(s) were going out of service for the day.From getting to the car, it took another 75 minutes to get out of the park. It was jut insane.At one point, we had considered trying to go in and out of the park just using YARTS, or other shuttles, but those shuttles are (for the most part) mired in much of the same traffic, and are (apparently) wildly unpredictable.Yosemite needs to do something to reduce the number of cars on the valley floor. They could take a page out of the Zion National Park book. Only let people who are camping onto the valley floor. Everyone else parks outside, and takes a well managed shuttle service into the valley. That, or make the entrance fee $200.I hate to sound like Edward Abbey, but there are just to darn many people in Yosemite.","July 26, 2011",Never again - at least not between Memorial day and Labor day.,73,"Santa Cruz, Ca.",2
Yosemite Valley,"I have been to Yosemite many times. The scenery is still beautiful but do not expect a National Park experience. You are driving in traffic jams and the popular hikes are very crowded - you may as well be taking a walk in NYC. I was there during the week so I cannot imagine how crowded it is on the weekends. In my opinion the park service must restrict the number of people and cars in this park or it will be ruined forever. We hiked outside of the park off of Rte 120 in the Yosemite Wilderness area and it was wonderful - a few other hikers, a raging river next to us, and at the end a waterfall. In Yosemite now it is wait in a traffic jam, park your car if you can find a spot or take the shuttle, hike with hundreds of other people to various waterfalls and wait in line at the overlook points to see anything. If you like lots of other people around you - and traffic jams then this is the place to go. I think John Muir would be sick to see what his beloved park has become - and how ironic that the hikes in Hetch Hetchy are empty and relatively pristine because hardly anyone goes there due to the dam.","June 30, 2011",Beautiful but too crowded,11,New York,2

Yosemite Valley,"My cross-country road trip with my 20 year old daughter culminated in a trip to Yosemite. Neither of us had been there before and we were overwhelmed by the grandeur of the place. Although we took dozens of photographs, nothing can recreate the spectacle of those mountains and waterfalls up close. We hiked - there are all kinds of hiking opportunities even for novices- and made new friends (a father-son duo on a similar adventure) and reinforced our own connection to each other. One night, after dining in our new friend's RV, we all went over to Curry Village and sang and played guitar on the porch of the lounge area and my daughter drew a crowd with her own songs.The only thing about the Valley I can't recommend is the Housekeeping Camp. It was cold and damp and dank and the only thing between you and the bears is a vinyl shower curtain. We preferred the KOA campground at Mariposa West.

With the mountain peaks and El Capitan playing hide and seek in the clouds , we were plummeted with rain first, a sprinkle of spring snow next and bright sunlight a little later. We counted our blessings for having experienced it all in such a short time.The rest of our trip was mostly the waterfalls all of which were in full flow thanks to generous snow and rains. We saw horsetail, bridal veil, upper and lower Yosemite falls and just wandered around the place and the valley meadows drinking in the beauty. We saw some deer on the 2nd day too - they walked right by us. Evening views of the three brothers and Half dome were majestic, the wonders of sunlight on Granite are forever.Some parts of the park were not open, Tioga Pass, Glacier point and the upper meadows were not open. We avoided Vernal falls because we did not have time for the trek it involves. We'd' like to go back someday to drive through Tioga Pass and see all of Yosemite from the height of Glacier point.In short a memorable place, a beautiful journey and everlasting memories.","June 20, 2011",Nature in all her magnificence - will never forget the place,46,"Bengaluru, India",5

Yosemite Valley,"Late April appears to be a perfect time to visit Yosemite. All the crowds you hear about in all the tourbooks (and on Trip Advisor)? They aren't there at that time. Sure, some roads are closed, and there's still a bit of snow in places, but don't let that stop you.The falls are in full bloom at this time of year. And because of the extra snowpack this year, we got waterfalls at their extra-full bloom! Lower Yosemite falls is an easy walk, as is Bridalveil. The mist walk to the top of Vernal falls was definitely worth the effort (and mud), but not for anyone with health issues -- this was my kids' favorite waterfall hike.An easy but long (4-6 hr, depending on your speed and agility) hike to consider is the West Valley Loop (about 6 miles RT). Mostly flat, you get close up views of El Capitan, Half Dome, and other natural wonders. We had to walk along the road for about 1/2 the trip because the trail was flooded but we still enjoyed the scenery. For a more bucolic walk, consider Mirror Lake. Check out the Cairn City someone (some group?) set up here -- darned impressive and hopefully the kids won't knock them over.The free shuttles are frequent and not too crowded at this time of year. Park in one of the parking lots at the end of the valley you want to explore and let them do all the driving.Food in the park is expensive. Avoid the Curry Food Pavilion for dinner -- though I hear the breakfast buffet is good -- I wish we'd stuck with our first choice (Bar at the Ahwahnee). We packed our lunches daily and enjoyed them on our daily hikes.The kids are begging to go back, so that's a sure sign of a good trip!","April 29, 2011","Go in the Spring for the Waterfalls & other natural beauty, enjoy the lack of crowds",36,SF Bay Area,5

Yosemite Falls is majestic with its cascading Upper Falls crashing down then gathering and continuing down as the Lower Falls.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite is an incredibly beautiful landscape. Huge trees, huge waterfalls, huge mountains all around the valley. There are lots of different walks and hiking trails in the park. If you are in good physical condition the more serious hikes like the Mist Trail should be easily do-able for you. I went on a guided hike of Half-Dome with Southern Yosemite Mountain Guides and it was an amazing experience. This is one of the most serious hikes in the park and you need to be in good physical condition to realistically expect to make it to the summit. We spent a night in Curry Village, which was fun, and started up the Mist Trail early the next morning. The Mist Trail takes you past massive waterfalls - at one point you climb a slippery rocky staircase up the side of 2 waterfalls and get pelted by mist from 2 directions. We camped over night and then climbed half-dome on day 2. The climb to the summit included walking up and down what feels like a very dangerous mountain side without hand rails for a few hundred metres to reach the ""sub-dome"" and then hauling yourself up 45-60 degree angle rock for another hundred metres or more to the summit using metal chain hand rails. The view from the top was amazing. We had lunch up there, descended down and camped again. On the 3rd day was returned to Curry Village via the John Muir trail which gave us different views of the waterfalls.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is indeed spectacular but 90% of visitors reportedly go ONLY to attractions in the Valley, so there are often crowds of people. We discovered a couple of HIDDEN GEMS where the scenery was equally, or even more, spectacular.....and there were NO CROWDS. On the road to Glacier Point stop at TAFT POINT and SENTINAL DOME--about a 1 mile walk to either will deliver you to unbelievably spectacular vistas. Taft Point sits on a ledge 3000 feet above Yosemite Valley. Then take the walk from Taft Point to Sentinal Dome along the valley rim---called the Pohono Trail (NOT back through the parking lot)---more incredible views of the Valley, El Capitan, and Yosemite Falls--and almost no one on the trail!Sential Dome is one of the highest points in the park and affords a 360 degree view. Another gem is the MARAPOSA SEQUOIA GROVE in the south end of the park---go to the UPPER GROVE, NOT the Lower Grove. 90% of the people walk from the parking lot to the big ""Grizzly"" tree (the first big sequoia in the park) and turn back---you are missing some incredibly beautiful trees and walking if you stop there. Take the tram from the Maraposa Grove parking lot to the museum, which will take you by some of the best Lower Grove sights. Get off the tram and walk from the museum up to the Upper Grove--it goes to Wiwona Point past amazing groves of giant sequoias, beautiful forrest, wild life---AND you will have it almost all to yourself.

We were using a hire car, had very little experience driving in the USA and no experience driving in icy and snow conditions. We were concerned about late snow falls in April so decided to use the services of a private tour guide. Before I left home I made contact with Yosemite and Beyond tours and arranged a 1 day of the valley for our family. Thank goodness I did as on the morning of the tour (1 April) there was a big dump of snow. We liaised over the phone to re-arrange the pick up time from our hotel, the Pines Resort. They were very accommodating and happy to fit in with our tight schedule. Our guide picked us up at 11.30am and we had a wonderful day. His enthusiasm and knowledge of the park was invaluable. As you can imaging Yosemite with fresh snow is a magical place. Particularly for our family from Sydney, Australia.

First of all If you are touring yosemite its silly to think you will skip this vital part of the park. Comeing from the south gate will give you the valley view as your introduction (this would be best). In our case we came in from the north so we say bridalvail falls first. The best way to see the valley is arrive early !!!!!!!!!! You will have the best chance to see wildlife and be able to stop and take pictures at will. I would say be at the valley floor by 7.30 am and tour all the stops on the way to the day use parking area. Park you car and ride the free shuttle bus to the visitor center and see the buildings and shops nearby. after your tour you can find a wide range of food choices to have lunch. I would than leave the valley and go tour another part of the park. Return the next day early and continue touring by using the bus and exit at the points that interest you. There is no need to take the day tour of the valley you can do this easily by yourself. (and save some money) for hikeing you can get all the info you need at the visitor center,there is something for everyone here. just a note about how difficult trails are, i have found most of them even when listed as easy may not be the case for people like me. in my 40s and not in shape. They can be done but i find them harder than what they list them for.

Yosemite Valley,"This was supposed to be the highlight of a 6 week trip to the western USA. After visiting Yellowstone, Bryce, Zion, Canyon De Chelly and many more excellent National Parks I found Yosemite valley to have been buried under asphalt. There are 2, two lane highways running each side of the vally along with separate cycle lanes, pull ins, car parks, inapropriate and rather seedy camp sites, lodges etc. It is almost impossible to properly appreciate what was once a beautiful and spectacular valley.The valley floor is covered with meadows but the willife is effectively prohibited access because of the amount or traffic. To reach the meadow animals have to cross one of the two highways... no wonder many are killed by traffic each year.We walked the trail to mirror lake. There are two trails to the lake, running on each side of the valley. A road has also been provided to give the disabled vehicular access. The trails are now used by horse riding groups, so they are almost impossible to negotiate on foot. As a consequence everyone uses the road and has to avoid the many cycles, OH! and I forgot to mention that the lake does not really exist... It is said to be seasonal.I feel that the National Park Service nationally does a brillant job, putting the environment and wildlife first.

The (very young, teenager-ish) park ""rangers"" were rude and disrespectful when telling us we had to park and wait for a shuttle to take us up to the trees since there was no parking up there. We waited a half hour for the shuttle. When it arrived, it was full. Had to wait for another shuttle. This one was almost full but we piled on anyway and had to stand squished together with everyone else. Saw the trees and then had to wait another half hour for the shuttle to take us back to our car.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite National Park is a destination well worth visiting, even though lodging can be difficult to come by. The hotels in the park are not inexpensive and are booked up to a year in advance. Plan early. If that is not an option, try the Housekeeping Camp. Be advised that it's just slightly better than roughing it in a tent, but relatively inexpensive at @ $100.00/night. Bring a pkg of Wet Ones to wipe off your vinyl covered mattress. And if you want a lockable front door, find another place to stay. But if you are used to camping, it's not bad at all. You can rent clean bed cloths there. The bath house is clean and efficiently maintained. Clean towels are given to you at the door. Firewood is available but all fires have to be out by 10pm.In early July the nights were very cool. Sweat cloths and blankets were necessary to be comfortable during the night. Bring a can of insect repellant just in case. It's an understatement to say that the Valley is beautiful. Many of our pics are worthy of wall mounting. In July, the temperature was mild. One night is not enough to experience all that Yosemite has to offer. But. if that's all you have, I highly recommend the Valley Floor Tour. It's a great way to learn about the Valley and get lots of pics you would otherwise miss while just driving through.

Yosemite Valley,All I thought as we entered the eastern entrance to Yosemite National Park was how lucky we are to have this treasure. We were lucky to hike and stay at May Lake High Sierra Camp.

Bridelveil falls, Glacier Point-pictures late morning to sunset, Maraposa Grove(giant Sequoia trees) in southern part of park-pictures good most of day.

Why not repair 5 miles at a time. The delays added an hour to the journey and made me leave the park by the longer Highway 140 exit to avoid the roadworks again.Also there is very limited parking at the Mariposa Grove entrance, the road into the Grove was closed this morning and parking was at Wawona, over 4 miles away with a packed shuttle bus ride into the Grove.Please npc, think these through in future..........","July 21, 2010",Good but Terrible road works,12,"Moreton-in-Marsh, United Kingdom",4

There are many levels of ease and difficulty available, so you will find one that fits you and see something lovely wherever you roam. Drive slowly as there is wildlife inside and they do cross the roads at will. In fact if you can, take one of the buses from OUTSIDE the park and then there are buses inside the park that come around very often to get you all around. Parking is a premium inside the park.

Yosemite Valley,"If you are a visitor making a tour of northern CA, try hard to include this in your itinerary. There is no place like Yosemite. Some similar, some different in various ways, but this unique scenery will remain in your memory long after other places have faded. Much has changed since my first visit there in 1954, and we have visited several times during the years since. Its popularity is the reason so many rules had to change. The tourists were loving it to death. Yes, I believe it is still a premier spot for climbers to come to challenge its stark stone walls. I was a childless young bride and when we spotted some climbers on the face of El Capitan, it took my breath away. ""Where are their Mothers?"" I asked. Many years later, when my own son challenged that wall a couple times before he made it to the top, I knew where their mothers were. At home, holding their breath. He vowed he would accomplish that goal before he graduated from college. He did. Three times. No, we didn't go to watch. We still go over to Yosemite since we retired in the nearby foothills. It's scenic grandeur still impresses us. Some rock slides have occurred in recent years. I think one took out a tent area, but it was not a time of tourists, though some were there, but not in the tents. If it is accessible, drive up to see Glacier Point and gaze down at the valley below. Look at the stone ledge where a famous movie star once did a handstand and lived to tell about it. It might have been Douglas Fairbanks, but don't quote me on that. I am sure the visitor shops have pictures of the event with solid facts. A lovely luncheon at the Ahwahnee Hotel has always made our day special. It's been awhile since we have done that, but at one time it was considered ""the place"" to eat. Yes, it is expensive, but seems to be worth it, or it was to us. I think we are overdue for our one day outing, and I'll update my information when we do that. Soon.","May 24, 2010",Do Not Miss seeing this gorgeous park.,32,"Maple Valley, Washington",5

Great pizza at Curry Village for a night eating under the stars and takeaway sandwiches at Degnans perfect for packed lunches. The village has some handy shops and the museum is worth a look.

Yosemite Valley,"I know it's trite, but I still have to say it: every American should see Yosemite. We went to San Francisco and Yosemite for our honeymoon this May - I had never been to the west coast. May is THE time to go for waterfalls - they were absolutely gushing with snowmelt! While it's supposed to be chilly in May (60s), there was a crazy warm spell. The Valley was just starting to get packed with tourists on our third and last day--June and July are ridiculously busy. The mountains were astonishingly beautiful. We drove up to just-reopened-for-the-summer Glacier Point and hiked the Taft Point trail. I'm in relatively good shape, and it was still a little difficult for me (""breath-taking"" in a completely different manner!), but to climb up to what seems like the top of the world was amazing! And I walked in snow - for the first time! (I'm from Florida.) Glacier Point offers a spectacular view - it's worth the hordes of people who got bussed up. My words cannot do Yosemite justice. Just as I wasn't prepared, even with plenty of research beforehand, neither will my review prepare you for the awesome beauty.","October 23, 2009",The beauty of Yosemite is breath-taking; awesome in the truest sense,22,"Gainesville, Florida",5
Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite in the fall is quiet. Cold in the morning, low 30's first week in October but warmed to the 60's and 70's. The crowds were small. The biggest issue is that the spring is a better time for photography. Many waterfalls have dried up by the fall since the only source of water is snow melt. There are no flowers in the fall where the meadows in the spring are covered with flowers. All in all Yosemite is an awesome place to visit. We did not hike very much but still were able to spend 5 full days all over the park. Do not miss the Maraposa grove of Sequoias. These trees are awesome.

One staff member called and told us, no, it wasn't running but someone standing next to him said, yes, it was. She directed us to Camp 4, where a sign said (1) El Capitan shuttle runs only until Labor Day, and (2) it runs through October! c) we waited for it under the sign only to see it stopping across the street and take off before we could catch it. If there's a sign for it--however contradictory the info--why not indicate where it stops??

Yosemite Valley,I am a packrafter and there are many rivers you can raft or kayak but none more stunning than the Merced River when it meanders through the Yosemite Valley!It's an easy trip and many people do it in blow up inflatables or tubes though I was happy to be in my Alpacka Packraft for the warmth. Their really are only a couple of places that are a little ripply nothing that would tip you over at least in late July when the river is barely running.Yet it's not speed but the sights to see that you are there for. No where in the world can you see both half dome and both the upper and lower falls from the same place on the river. It's just breathtaking! I ran it 5 times total over 2 trips.It's so easy to put in near curry village and then take out and pay to take the school bus run by the float trip operator back to your car.Soooo fun!! If you go to Yosemite time it to when you can run the river because they have many rules and regulations on when it can be run. So this is mostly a June and July activity depending on how the river is running. Too early in the season and it's too cold or too fast to high to run and too late in the season not enough water.Like everything in life from love to rafting...it's all in the timing which will determine your experience.,"October 8, 2009","Rafting the Yosemite Valley, the glorious merced River!!",10,santa cruz,5

Yosemite Valley,"This was my first trip to Yosemite and can say I was in awe of it's beauty from the valley floor to it's highest peaks and giant trees. My husband and I stayed at Yosemite Lodge at the falls and it was a clean, comfortable accomodation which suited our needs just fine. This is NOT a luxury hotel but more for travelers wanting a clean bed and a decent room. It was a bit noisy, especially in the morning when travelers were hustling to meet their tour bus. The food court located near the main entrance of the hotel was fine for breakfast and lunch, although we did splurge one day and went to the Awahnee for lunch. We weren't impressed with the food. (It just cost a lot more.) We took a tram tour of the valley floor one day which lasted about 2 hours with a few stops for picture taking and stretching your legs. I enjoyed this very much and it's a great way to see the valley floor and learn a few things in the process. My husband and I walked to the falls which was full and cascading as we went at the end of May when. I suggest wearing a good pair of walking shoes, take a camera and some water along. There is a free shuttle bus that travels all along the valley floor and this is also a very convienient way to get around. We drove up to the Half Dome look out, and over to the Giant Sequoia grove which was an amazing sight. Although there are thousands of tourists in Yosemite yearly, it still strikes me as a wild, untouched place. There are endless things to do and I doubt anyone could ever call it boring! P.S. We did not see any bears, but were fully aware of there presence.","September 10, 2009",First time and want to go back!,3,"Santa Rosa, CA",5

The tents (with wood floors & screen doors) were of canvas and in good shape, really an adventure in itself. Yes, they're close together but after 10pm only noise we heard were from some ranger's in camp chasing out a small bear. Take shower shoes. Buffet at the lodge at curry village was good, hey, your there for the unbelievabe scenery. Good evening outdoor presentations in the village for free, other outdoor eatery's for Pizza & beer , good family spot if your not camping or want to pay +$500/night at the Alwahanie hotel, but had breakfast there for our last morning. Worth the $50 bucks total for the two of us for the atmosphere and buffet.The FIRST thing you should see is Glacier Point, maybe even catch the star gazing show they put on, or watch them by yourself. but start there first. Its a bit of a drive (30 miles from the valley up there..but well worth it) An AWESOME sight. Took the hike up to Nevada falls, not too bad (I'm 57, daughter is 24) You'll huff and puff but worth the hike for half the day, figure 5hrs round trip, there is a water station just below the first fall. Carry a water bottle or two, maybe a snack, enjoy the hike. Park your car and take the shuttles to visit the other falls and the welcome center. The 30 min show they have is worth the time to see, but not necessary right off the bat. We stayed two days and then drove across the upper park across Tiaoga Pass. Gorgeous scenery up in the high Sierras, but a bit of a drive for only a day trip. If your going on to Nevada, definitely go that way, or do a circular route back to LA..

Yosemite Valley,"Without question, Yosemite Valley is one of the most beautiful places in the world, in fact I would go so far as to say it is the most beautiful place in the world. It is a freak of nature that concentrates so much beauty into a compact area that it's almost like being in another world, that is better than this world. Beauty comes in many scales: large scale (giant granite walls and rocks, colossal waterfalls), medium (forests and the Merced River) and small scale (the tiny but beautiful Fern Spring, the wildlife, even the tiny wildflowers at your feet). Trees grow out of seemingly impossible locations high on rock walls. Clouds head for a colllision course with a massive granite rock, then suddenly morph and wrap themselves around the rock like a milky velvet glove. Deer graze nonchalantly in the late afternoon. We saw two bear cubs frolicking in the Happy Isles area. The constantly changing angle of the sun all day long keeps changing the appearance of everything, and the changing seasons throughout the year also change the look of the place dramatically. Yosemite Valley and Point Lobos State Reserve near Carmel are the two most beautiful places in California. It's not even necessary to ""do"" anything to enjoy Yosemite Valley. So many visitors are bent on ""doing something"" such as rafting or ice skating or a major hike like the grueling and dangerous Half Dome hike. But it's not necessary to ""do"" anything in Yosemite to enjoy it. The gestalt of the place, the feeling you get from being there, just taking in all the beauty and stunning sights, is the real experience. Yes, Yosemite Valley can get very crowded and that lowers the quality of the experience. The best time of year to visit Yosemite Valley, at least from the standpoint of the waterfalls, is May or early June at latest. Avoid Memorial Day weekend, but the week before Memorial Day weekend is a splendid time to visit Yosemite Valley. Everyone should come to this place at least once in their life. There is really nothing quite like it anywhere else in the world.","July 19, 2009",A masterpiece of nature,51,"Goldfield, Nevada",5
Yosemite Valley,"My husband and I visited Yosemite in early June, 2009. We arrived very early and were surprised that there were so few people around. We thought, ""Gee, all the hype about so many people must be exaggerated!"" We sauntered around for several hours, enjoying the views. Between 10 am and noon, however, thousands of people entered the park. All of a sudden, there were RVs, cars, busses and people everywhere. We had rented bikes, but after the crowds arrived, we couldn't ride our bikes on the paths for all of the people. It was just as we had been told--masses and masses of people. If you need to go to the bathroom--now that is an experience. The bathrooms were just horrible. You'd think that a big park like that would have some sort of solution to the bathroom problem. We could smell the bathrooms for hundreds of feet away. People told us that the food options were not good, but we thought they were OK. However, other than coffee and a muffin, we brought our own food and had a picnic at lunchtime, and we were glad that we did. My advice--go to Yosemite very very early to avoid the crowds.

I was only able to be there for a couple of days, but I could not believe how much I was able to see. I know there is so much more that I missed like the Tolumne Meadows, but the proximity of Half Dome to El Capitan and Bridal Veil Falls, Glacier Point, etc. is amazing!Glacier Point in June at sunset is amazing. It was a high snow year when I went so the peaks were still covered in about 4 feet of snow and when the sun set and the alpen glow shone bright pink, and dusk settled over the valley, it was beautiful. The rivers and the falls were raging when we were there. I can't recommend enough to go n the spring to ensure that the falls are vibrant. Friends of ours went in August and Bridal Veil falls was but a trickle. When they saw our photos, they could not believe it was the same place. Going to see the Sequoia's is a must. They are such beautiful, magnificent trees. To see the visitor's center nestled among them gives great perspective to their massiveness. The hotel near this part of the park (the name escapes me) is very charming and serves a great dinner with a comfortable, historic atmosphere. I also recommend at least checking out the Awahnee if you can't afford to stay there. The views from the hotel are spectacular and the architecture and styling of the hotel itself are beautiful and rustic, but chic.I look forward to returning to Yosemite to see all the park.

Yosemite Valley,"Whilst visiting San Francisco, we decided to get out and see some of the Californian countryside and so decided on a 1 day trip to Yosemite National Park and Yosemite Valley.Although all the tours are operated and booked with Greyline, we got a better price by looking through the various brochures on offer and selecting a different agent. The tour is a full day, so not recommended for families with young children or teenagers that get easily bored being on a bus for long periods of time.The tour starts in the Fishermans Wharf area around 8am. Hotel pickup and drop off is provided.There are ample stops for food, dink and restrooms and you have a good 3 hours to venture off on your own to wander around the Yosemite Valley floor. Great for a taste of Yosemite.The drive to Yosemite is lovely and gives you a view of some of the countryside, local farmland and windmill farms. We stopped at a fruitmarket on the way to taste some of the local produce and purchase fresh fruit and nuts.Yosemite, itself is spectacular and certainly nothing that we were expecting with its sheer cliffs and waterfalls. As we were there end summer, the waterfalls were not flowing but it was still magnificent.There is a dinner stop on the way home and we were dropped back at our San Francisco hotel around 9:30pm.

Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley was the most incredible place I have ever visited in my Lifetime. Despite The Fire That was burning nearby and was causing haze in the park, I LOVED IT. Let me tell you about the attractions nearby:First, there's Yosemite Falls. There is an Upper Yosemite Falls And A Lower Yosemite Falls. If you don't have kids, you might want to take a shot at a hike up to the Upper Falls, which is much bigger and more majestic than the lower falls. However, If you do have kids, DO NOT hike to the upper falls with them. It is a very steep and rugged climb. Take them on the flat and beautiful, yet short trail to the Lower Falls. The Lower Falls is still very beautiful and is worth seeing. However, if you want to get up close to the Lower Falls, you're gonna need to face a lot of rocks. But its not hard to get through them, even if you have kids. (Keep kids 5 and under away from the rocks). Then, There's El Capitan, A Beautiful Rock Formation That Overlooks Yosemite National Park. There is two beaches that are located next to a crystal-clear river at the foot of El Capitan. (In case you plan to swim in the water, its very clean, but ice cold, because the water is melted snow). Also, There's Mirror Lake. Its A Large And Very Scenic Lake That's worth visiting. However, it's quite a climb up to the lake, so, if your kids are tired, it's best you don't climb to the lake. Trust Me.There is great dining in the valley. Try the Mountain Room at Yosemite Lodge At The Falls. It's a beautiful restaurant that Overlooks the Yosemite Falls. The food is perfect, and the staff is VERY nice. I don't recommend the restaurant at The Ahwanne Lodge. The menu only has about 10 items on it. NOT the meal your kids will desire. If you're looking for something quick, Try the food court at Yosemite Lodge At The Falls. It has a large selection of food, with plenty of seating. The Village store is also good for a pick-up-and-go meal. The Village Store has everything you need for both your stay and your meals.There is a shuttle that goes around the valley with about 30 stops, including stops at Yosemite Falls, The Foot of the trail that leads to Mirror Lake, The Ahwanne Lodge, Campgrounds, Parking, And Yosemite Lodge At The Falls. There is also a special shuttle that makes stops at and around El Capian That leaves every half hour on the hour. The Shuttle For El Capitan Kicks Off From The Visitor Center Shuttle Stop, And Then Begins Its Route.","July 29, 2008",Amazing And Fun.

Yosemite Valley,"If you are looking for a long weekend trip from the San Francisco area (or are lucky enough to have more time), this is the place to go. We drove through Sacramento to hit Hwy 49 and took a detour to Sutter's Mill to see where gold was discovered. That's a different review - but a worthwhile stop.We entered the park via Hwy 140, past Coulterville, and loved every breathtaking view. There are many switch-backs, but there are also enough places to pull off the road if motion sickness is a concern. The speed limit is posted and most people seemed to adhere to it. Why you would want or need to drive faster is beyond me as there is so much to take in.The entrance from the east is supposed to be superior to the direction which we drove in, but Yosemite Valley is Yosemite Valley whichever way you get there. El Capitan, Yosemite Falls, the Valley - all of it! I just wish I would think of a word to have used when my jaw was not dropped open in awe, other than ""wow!"" Don't forget to hit the Mariposa Giant Sequoia Tree Park. There are short trails as well as a shuttle for those who prefer a lift. There's also a gift shop! (gotta have those)A long weekend trip that I will never forget. Don't miss Yosemite when you have the chance.","June 8, 2008",Blew My Mind!,41,"Nashville, Tennessee",5
Yosemite Valley,"I went camping for one week in the park in May 2008. Even though it rained for the first two days, and the weather was not so ideal, I still found it stunningly beautiful!This is the most beautiful place I have ever been to and I have been to many places. Yosemite National Park is definitely the number one place you have to visit before you die.","June 6, 2008",The most beautiful place I have visited.,52,NY,5
Yosemite Valley,"How can I not give Yosemite a 5-star experience? The natural wonders in this park are endless, and breathtaking. As far as the valley ""experience"", overall it's less than 5-star. If you come in summer, you will be shoulder to shoulder with people. There will be lines everywhere, for everything, including the restrooms. The dining areas are packed, the buses are crowded, cars and RV's are everywhere...good luck finding a place to park! I feel sorry for those who stay in the hotels...I can only imagine the sea of humanity! If you are going to visit in summer, I would sugget you camp, instead of staying at a hotel/lodge. You will always have a place to park, and if you get lucky to get a North Pines campsite (not sure why it's the lowest rated Pines campground in TripAdvisor...), you will feel you have room to move. This Pines campground is the most spread out, and has the least number of sites. It actually feels somewhat spacious for a campground in such prime territory. I would also deter anyone from staying at Camp Curry...in summer they should rename it Camp Sardines.Winter is really the best time to visit Yosemite Valley. It's FAR less crowded (I'd say 15% of summer), and you feel like you have the place to yourself. I love photography, and we were able to zip around back and forth near sunset to get some great shots of different sights from different locations. No hassles parking, and hardly anyone around to clutter up the pictures. If you can stand the cold, you'll really enjoy the experience.","February 1, 2008","Great in Winter, Crowded in Summer",122,"Walnut Creek, California",5
Yosemite Valley,"If you only do one national park - this is the one. If you can travel in from the South, although it's a longer route you will travel round a bend and all of a sudden be greeted with an awesome view that will force you to concentrate on your driving!! round the next bend through the tunnel and you are at a proper vista point. pull in and soak it up...Take time to sit around and watch for bears and deer on the valley floor.Make a trip up to Glacier Point for sunset on Half Dome - fingers crossed for a good one.The Awhanee hotel is worth a look and a dream as the nightly rate is beyond most folks!!!From the valley floor great view looking up at El Capitain - take binoculars and watch for climbers - they must be crazy...","October 8, 2007",Awesome national park,59,UK,5
Yosemite Valley,"We took a day tour of Yosemite from San Fransico. It was well worth the very early start. Our first stop was a viewpoint of Yosemite Valley. The day we visited there was a controlled burn taking place so there was some smoke in the valley. but the view was amazing. This sight just has to be seen.We also stopped at viewpoints of El Capitan, Half Dome and Bridleviel falls. The best part of the trip was the Giant Sequoias. Once you park take the 1 mile walk downhill to the largest trees on the planet. Nothing prepares you for their awesome size. I had seen photos of them but in the flesh they are just amazing. Further down the path from the living trees is a dead tree that has a large opening cut into its base which you can walk through. After you have visited this tree (best photographed from the downhill side looking back up) turn right and go behind some other trees and you will see one that has fallen on it's size. (Many people miss this.) This really gives you an idea of how large these trees really are. My 10 year old son literally walked through the this tree from root to tip ""on the inside"". This is how big these trees are.The only downside to our trip was that in July many of the waterfalls are only trickles and Yosemie Falls was almost dry. The best time to see these large waterfalls is in January to March. Also one day is so not long enough to see everything properly. Consider camping or staying in the Yosemite Lodge. We stopped at the lodge for lunch and it was really nice. The restaurant was large, had a good selection of food and was reasonable in price. There are also some really good gift shops.","August 17, 2007",Fantastic Scenery,200,"Largo, Florida",5
Yosemite Valley,The May visit to Yosemite was a great time to visit. The warm weather and cascading falls were a joy. Saw lots of bear sign but did not see any bears. Plenty of stores to visit in the valley. California Hwy 140 into the park is an outstanding road and has great views along the way. Well worth a visit.,"June 7, 2007",May in Yosemite,27,"Clayton, NC",4

Yosemite Valley,"This is a photographer and nature lover's paradise. Get out of the village crowds and walk along the flat beautiful trails or hike to Vernal Falls. Yosemite Falls is not to be missed! Renting a bike for a few hours is a wonderful way of exploring the valley. If you have time, watch the sun set from Glacier Point or go for a drive along Tioga Pass road. I JUST LOVE YOSEMITE!","November 3, 2006","Late May, early June is the best time to come",56,"San Diego, California",5
Yosemite Valley,"It is hard to put into words the grandeur and beauty of this place. See it before you die. Photographs can't capture it all, but Ansel Adams did a great job. I recommend staying in a hotel in the park even if it costs you a lot of money. Make reservations a year ahead of time. The more you pay for the room, the better you will like it. It is worth the splurge. If you can, stay a week or more. If you stay outside the park you will waste a lot of time commuting, a stressful drive at that. Stay south of the park if you must stay outside the park. The north side is pretty much the country, very beautiful but with few amentities. Stay in the Valley if at all possible. I do not recommend camping. It is very crowded and a bit noisy. Bears are a real probelm folks. They are very used to people and grizzely bears walk into campsites at night all the time. They climb into cars and pry doors open to get food. Honest truth.Food sold on site is OK. Again, you get what you pay for.Hiking is awesome, vistas incredible, rafting is fun, waterfalls spectacular. Parking is adequate. Rent a bicycle and raft. Park your car. Take the buses.Ansel Adams photos say it all. Mine don't compare.","September 14, 2006",Ansel Adams got it right.,29,"Bonn, Germany",5

Yosemite Valley,"What a beautiful place, really awe inspiring. We visited mid September and it really wasnt that busy. We swam in the river even though it was FREEZING, great fun. Be warned of two things. 1) It is massive - we thought we were there when we paid at the gate, and it took another two hours to get to our camp! 2) Dont arrive after dark, there is no street lighting so when it is dark it is REALLY dark.","September 20, 2004",Excellent place - and sooooo big!,31,"London, UK",5
Yosemite Valley,"Yosemite Valley is not a wilderness experience, especially not the eastern portion of the valley. The atmosphere is probably comparable to that of a popular ski resort. It's like visiting a small isolated city (albeit a city with jaw-dropping scenery). I spent a couple days there this spring and during that time I noticed a stretch limo, a UPS delivery van, a beer truck and a garbage truck (in the process of emptying a dumpster) among the regular auto traffic on the roads----and I wasn't particularly looking for signs of encroaching ubanization. Guidebook writers compare the place to a cathedral, but that's a description that's a little outdated, in my opinion. Having seen the place during the off-season, I'd never go there during the summer, when they say traffic is bumper-to-bumper. For me, even scenery as majestic as Yosemite's isn't worth putting up with the crush of summertime mass tourism.","September 12, 2004","Love Yosemite,Hate the Masses",557,san diego,5
