Shenandoah Valley,"Shenandoah National park is beautiful! Skyline drive is a wonderful way to enjoy the park , many places to stop and enjoy the splendor.","August 13, 2019",Magnificent views,1,"Dallas, Pennsylvania",5
Shenandoah Valley,"This will be a bit biased as I live in the valley, in the area that was the muse for the John Denver song ""Country Roads."" The valley runs north to south for miles and miles and miles. It features hiking and mountain bike trails, ski facilities, canoe and rafting opportunities, tubing for the less adventurous, horseback rikding, snowmobiling, rock climbing, fishing, hunting and most anything that can be done outdoors. I recommend drives along Skyline Drive and the Blue Ridege Parkway, particularly in the fall. If you're in the area stop by the bridge over the New River Gorge; maybe you could see the bridge on the day it is closed for base jumping. The Appalachain Trail runs through the valley, you could park at one of the many trail heads and walk a ways bragging a bit that you hiked the trail. Not an adventurer. The valley is loaded with history from early colonial days through the revolutionary war and the civil war. Historic markers and sites all around with many towns boasting a historic center. One of my favorites is Shepherdstown possibly the oldest town in West Virginia dating to before the revolutionary war when it was part of the Virginia Territory. It sits at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenanadoah Rivers, the Appalachain Trail runs through it, and the bottom of the town is a national park focused on the civil war and John Brown. Folks are friendly and the pace may be a bit slower than it is on the other side of the mountains.","August 8, 2019","""Take Me Home""",8,"Ranson, West Virginia",5
Shenandoah Valley,"For the three nights we stayed in this area the most used word out of our mouth was WOW, almost around every corner there was another fantastic view, or a wild animal to avoid, good job the speed limit is 35 mph, not that you want to go much faster, just chill and take it all in.","July 7, 2019",A must see,130,england,5
Shenandoah Valley,"Some friends from Florida came up to view the cherry tree blossoms in DC. While here, I was invited to stay with them at a nearby resort for a few days. We drove to the national park and explored the various hiking trails. We also visited the H. Byrd, Sr. Visitor Center. Be prepared to get a glimpse of the Shenandoah Valley origins. Interesting and informative. So much to see and hear. We also enjoyed a sack lunch and got a chance to people watch. Granted, much of the scenery had not burst out in spring greenery yet. But when it does change, wow!","May 15, 2019",Shenandoah National Park Day Trip,32,"Gainesville, Virginia, United States",4

Shenandoah Valley,"If you are a nature lover and want to see the nature colors, then the fall season is meant for you. Color splash of nature at it's best! You have to visit Shenandoah National Park in Virginia just few hours drive from Washington DC. I just pack my food, drinks and drove to Shenandoah with my group on a sunny day of fall. Drive was amazing as you can see the color splash of leaves on both the sides of highway!it was so wonderful to look on both the sides of highway. Perfect blend of all the colors green, yellow, purple, pink and orange. Basically, shenandoah is known for its long stretch of fall trees. People usually visit to see the colors and enjoy the long drive, there are camping grounds where you can do camping and at night can enjoy the star gazing experience. Perfect location for a weekend to enjoy with family and friends. Only a ticket is charged when you enter the national park. There's a nice shop there where you can take souvenirs and some packed food. Go and spend your day nicely in fall season and enjoy the color splash of nature. It's worth visiting! ","March 29, 2019",A Day in Virginia’s Shenandoah National Park!,6,"New Delhi, India",4

Shenandoah Valley,"The Shenandoah Valley is rich with activities for visitors. We have visited Shenandoah National Park many times (an abundance of hiking trails and beautiful vistas). It was especially crowded during our October 2018 visit....so that diminished our enjoyment of the park. But, there is so much more to do in the Valley (wineries, cider makers, farmers markets, Civil War sites, orchards just to name a few). You could easily spend a week exploring the Shenandoah. Step back in time and enjoy a quieter, peaceful, friendly way of life.","January 19, 2019",So Much To Do in the Shenandoah Valley,461,"Newport News, Virginia",5

Shenandoah Valley,"I think it’s important to rate camp grounds and Rv parks. We travel with a motorhome and find many places over rated and under rated. This campground was small but came with so many great amenities, I just needed to share. It is right next to US81 so great and close when arriving and leaving, they have nice big pull through sites, very important when towing ...gravel and grass on site. They have fire pits, but the best deal is the huge fire pit with hanging chairs in the centre of the park. This is awesome and make this park fun and social, even if it’s just an overnight stay. Club house has a little store of needs and souvenirs and owner and staff very friendly and helpful. Another exceptional thing about this is it’s within walking distance of the Shenandoah Caverns and Yellow Barn Museum...thus made out whole trip.....this stay....we will try and get back another year.","April 24, 2018",Shenandoah Valley Camping,58,"Prince Edward Island, Canada",4

Shenandoah Valley,What a beautiful part of the countryside with magnificent views and lovely walks. First doubtful at the 35mph speed limit it became apparent that this is plenty fast enough along the twisting roads.Lots of places to pull over most seemed to be on the right so travelling south may be the better option. Access to the Appalachian Trail can give the motorist the feeling of adventure without necessarily having to walk the length of it. A great day out. ,"September 26, 2017",Outstanding,169,"Northampton, United Kingdom",5
Shenandoah Valley,"I loved this easy, scenic drive and it is one that I highly recommend. If you are in the area and are in no hurry, TAKE IT! But, there is no need to stop at many of the many wayside lookouts. The views of the valleys below are green and lush but the same one turn after another. My wife and I being in our mid60s found those trails signified as easy to be just that, so get out and walk a bit but remember that you are atop a mountain so the easy hike down is a bit tougher on the way back and up.","August 11, 2017","Seen One Valley, You've Seem 'Em All",27,"Chicago, Illinois",4
Shenandoah Valley,"An intense two-day hike on the Hogsback Overview trail. My friend and I spotted 3 waterfalls, the last being the largest - placed in a panoramic overview. This was along the Overall Runs Trail. There was also a water hole with three or four little pools (it was extremely cold when we were there!), so bring a swim suit if you're on this trail. Didn't run into a bear but saw traces of one, still recommend a bear bag. This trail requires you to walk through... maybe 4 streams, so be prepared :) I wouldn't recommend taking the Beecher Ridge Trail returning back because it was pretty boring and all you're doing is hiking UPHILL. Almost the entire time. I would recommend to hike the Heiskell Hollow Trail on the loop back to Hogsback Overview Parking lot. The camp ranger also recommended this, but seeing as we were short on time we decided on the shorter trail (Beecher).To end the hiking trip, we drove to the highest summit along the Skyline Drive: Hawksbill Trail. This trail to the summit was about 20-30min but the overlook was gorgeous. Overall, this valley was spectacular and I have great memories here. Would definitely recommend taking your family along the Skyline Drive (if they're unable to hike) - you do have to pay a fee for access to the 100-mile drive. I could see myself going again!","July 15, 2017",Multi-level degree of difficulty hiking,20,"Brussels, Belgium",5

Everyone at the Meadow ranger station was as helpful as can be, sincerely wanting to help us have the best time possible. Driving was not difficult and we were able to have a nice leisurely meander from vista to vista. I am not a hiker and was disappointed that seeing waterfalls required a long walk. I contented myself with seeing them in the 12 minute video presentation at the ranger station, which also had a well stocked gift shop.","March 8, 2017",What a wonderful day we had through the park.,200,"Pensacola, Florida",5
Shenandoah Valley,"The Shenandoah Valley, or the Valley of Virginia, is as beautiful as it is historical. The first white explorers arrived in 1671. During the Civil War, it was known as the Breadbasket of the Confederacy. Stonewall Jackson desperately attempted to defend the Shenandoah from Federal troops who were determined to cut off the Confederacy's primary source of food. Today, it is a lush land of vineyards and rivers and waterfalls and mountains and historic towns and hiking and biking trails and breath-taking scenery. The Shenandoah is bounded to the east by the Blue Ridge Mountains to the west by the eastern front of the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians (excluding Massanutten Mountain, which splits the valley), to the north by the Potomac River and Harpers Ferry and to the south by the James River. It roughly follows the length of Interstate Highway 81 and the historic Valley Pike (U.S. Route 11) from Martinsburg, West Virginia, to Roanoke, Virginia, a distance of 200 miles. It includes such towns as Winchester, Harrisonburg, Lexington, Staunton and Covington. It features a number of geologically and historically significant limestone caves such as Skyline Caverns, Luray Caverns, Shenandoah Caverns and Grand Caverns. Many visitors choose to drive 105-mile Skyline Drive from Front Royal to Rockfish Gap. It is the main road through Shenandoah National Park with access to campgrounds and resorts and 75 overlooks that provide spectacular views of the valley. Other interesting attractions are Virginia Military Institute (VMI) and George C. Marshall Library and Robert E. Lee's Chapel in Lexington and the Museum of the Shenandoah Valley in Winchester and Natural Bridge in Natural Bridge and Frontier Culture Museum of Virginia and the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library in Staunton.","January 26, 2017",Recalling the Breadbasket of the Confederacy,4679,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Shenandoah Valley,We did a 1.5 mile hike down to view a beautiful waterfall and back up for a 3 mile total hike. We took an apple each for the trip and nothing else. Found a stick in the woods to help with hiking back up the trail. Fantastic view of nature. My 4 yo and 11yo loved it. We sat at the bottom of the waterfall for quite a while just talking to each other and strangers that were also blissfully pleased with the perfect Thanksgiving Day!$20 to enter national park. Only 4 designated entrances on Skyline Dr. Park rangers are very helpful. You don't have to hike. You can just drive the scenic route and pull over at designated sight-seeing parking spots!

Shenandoah Valley,"Part of our trip as we were heading home from South Carolina was to go to Shanadoah and through Skyline Drive. The views were breathtaking! We stopped at a few area where you can pullover and see the mountains. Unbelievable and the weather was beautiful which made the sights even more breathtaking. We hiked Frazier Mountain, on part of the hike we were on the Appalachian trail. Fresh clean air and the trees crossing over one another. The hike took about an hour, not bad for amatures.After our hike we went to the tourist shop/ restaurant and bought lunch. As we were eating we saw two deers just galloping across the road. They just stopped to graze awhile weren't even bothered by the forest rangers who were a hundred feet away. We so amazed at the views and how clean. We drove through most of it but now we know next time there are places to stay and there is more to see. The caverns and doing some horseback riding also some history about the civil war.Great for those of you who like to camp.Would definitely go back and also drive south onto the Blue Ridge Parkway.

Shenandoah Valley,"There are many ways to enjoy the grandeur of the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. You can travel Skyline Drive from Front Royal to Clifton Forge or you can drive the historic Valley Pike, old Route 11 which parallels I-81 from Winchester to Harrisonburg. Driving the Valley Pike is a trip to the past, to the Civil War, when the Shenandoah was the breadbasket of the Confederacy and the Union Army's primary target. Visit old battlefields in Winchester, Kernstown, Fisher's Hill, Tom's Brook, Cedar Creek and New Market, all the way to Cross Keys and Port Republic. And the old but well kept towns along the route...Winchester, Strasburg, Front Royal, Woodstock, Mount Jackson, Edinburg. Woodstock, the county seat, is alive and well and thriving. In Mount Jackson, visit the Confederate cemetery and the site of one of the Confederacy's largest hospitals and the old covered bridge on the South Fork of the Shenandoah River. New Market features one of the best museums of any battlefield in the South, an excellent film that tells the role of the Virginia Military Institute's cadets and a tour of the adjacent battlefield, the famed ""battle of the lost shoes,"" is even quicker than First Manassas. All the time, you can view the beauty and majesty of the Valley and mighty Massanutten Mountain, which splits the spectacular landscape in half, or view the popular Luray Caverns or the Natural Bridge of Virginia or one of the many vineyards. From North to South, it provides one of the grandest vistas in the country. If you are a nature lover or a history lover, you'll be glad you spent a few days in the Shenandoah Valley.","August 11, 2015","If you haven't been there, you've got to go",4679,"Chicago, Illinois",5

Set in the gently rolling Blue Ridge mts. of VA, Shenandoah has amazing vistas and verdant parkways. We traveled the length and breath of the park from Front Royal to Clifton Forge. The tiny pocket-size towns scattered along the way provided a picturesque scene within the valley.Along the Skyline Drive, as the route is termed, we admired a perfect day, bright sun and clear sky. At night, once the stars became visible, the sky put in a glowing show of meteoric display that was every bit as spectacular as the day had been.The Shenandoah circle valley encompasses what a national park was meant to be.","March 24, 2015",Shenandoah circle,75,"Los Angeles, California",5
Shenandoah Valley,"This is a beautiful place to drive through. The appalachian parkway comes right up to the doorstep of Shenandoah National Park, where it turns into Skyline Drive through the park. In contrast to the Smokies, Shenadoah is peaceful, restful, gentle beauty. It is green and rolling, with many varieties of birds. It is a quite paradise for nature lovers that prefer less crowded scenic byways. You can stay in the park. There are wonderful hikes, a couple of restaurants and even horseback riding! Plan ahead, though, since there is only that one place to stay in the park. You can also stay outside of the park. I really enjoyed staying in Luray for a few day, a small town off of highway 211 that allows easy access to the more northern sections of the park. There are also caverns there.

Shenandoah Valley,"I surprised my husband with a 2-day trip to the park in the fall. We've always been in the summer. It was beautiful!! I've never seen such amazing colors. The views were breathtaking. There is a lot of wildlife, mostly deer, everywhere. The speed limit is 35 and you should really stay at that because the deer are everywhere. Most people are ok with that. Every once and awhile you get someone in a hurry, but you can pull off at an overlook and let them race away while you enjoy the beauty of nature. Some of the trail are very difficult so make sure you read the signs at the beginning of each trail. If the sign warns that it is difficult, listen. They don't exaggerate. We stayed in Harrisonburg, about a half hour drive away. Very doable. There is a $15.00 entry fee but that is for a full week.

Shenandoah Valley,"Skyline Drive, starting at Front Royal, VA, is one of the most beautiful routes ! Running parallel to the Appalachian Trail, it snakes through 100 miles covered by mature forrest, rocky precipices, and is dotted with lodges, restaurants, gift shops, knowledgeable park service guides and many activities. I met a few hikers making the AT trek from Georgia to Maine and numerous day hikers on the trails that vary from easy to very hard! The surrounding area of Virginia is rich in history, vineyards and amazing restaurants. This area is worthy of many weekend trips to enjoy the numerous opportunities for adventure and relaxation it has to offer.","July 22, 2014","Shenandoah the beautiful: spectacular vistas, beautiful hikes, excellent visitors centers!",15,,5
Shenandoah Valley,"Drove the 103 mile Skyline Dr amidst very little traffic. The views are amazing and scenic overlooks abound. The Appalachian Trail runs through and alongside the road with short and long hikes available along the way. We did the Little Stony Man trail to an amazing vista which we had all to ourselves. We also did the Blackrock Summit trail to another gorgeous view. There is lots of wildlife to be seen...we even saw a black bear right along the road. We took about a day to drive, with an overnight at Skyland Resort in the park.

Shenandoah Valley,"We had never vacationed in the Shenandoah Valley and chose it for that reason. I also knew it was full of historical sites and other attractions to see. We spent an entire week in the valley and used a vacation rental in the Bryce Mountain Resort (Basye, VA) as our home base. We went sight seeing every day and saw some interesting historical places and other things of interest. We live in the mountains of NC, so we are accustomed to similar and more rugged terrain. The valley is so extensive, you could easily spend two weeks there and not see all there is to see. I would return again, but would choose to move along the route, and stay a couple of nights in different locations. This would cut down on the daily drive to various attractions, which were often long and tiring trips. I would also recommend staying in some of the medium to larger cities in the valley. Although there are many small towns which are historic and very pretty, the number of restaurants and things to do are very limited in those areas. All in all, a great vacation for couples or families with children of all ages.","June 18, 2014",Gorgeous Area,81,Western NC,4

Shenandoah Valley,"I went her to backpack and camp in the mountains for the 4th of July weekend. We literally had no experience or knowledge about this place before going. It is a beautiful area to go for friends, family, or even a couple. There is 100 miles of road in the top of the mountains that has wonderful views of the sunrise and sunset. Its about a 30 minute ride to the nearest town (mainly because of the slops of the mountains). There is plenty of trails to hike! Highly recommend stretching your calves and bringing lots of water!!! There is plenty of opportunity to get lost as well, so a map, compass and a friend is also recommended. I will definitely return to this place again!! Pros: beautiful sites, wonderful hiking experiences, get in touch with the outdoors. cons: bears, bears, and more bears! Which actually isnt that much of a con, because bears are pretty cool and they keep to themselves for the most part. A nice tip, its about 15-20 degrees lower in the tops of the mountains. The stars are incredible!! Bring extra food and have a full tank of gas if your driving. They have 2 stores located alone the 100 mile road, but they are spaced out, and the mountain driving will wear your gas quicker. Also, the stores charge a little bit more for items, since they have to have it delivered into the mountains, so i recommend stocking up on items, if your watching your budget.The fee to drive into the mountains was about $8 for a week pass.","December 10, 2013",Wonderful experience!!!,18,"Markham, Illinois",5

Shenandoah Valley,"We stayed in a 2 bedroom condo per our Government veterans reservation. We only stayed from Saturday thru Tues and checked out Weds instead of Saturday because we found out the Washington DC was over 2 hours drive from here and we wanted to see DC. Even tho we paid for a whole week and did not benefit from it we enjoyed the time in the condo. The condo was well appointed with all but there was a few things that bothered us but not a big deal. First if you wish to read in the front room you need to bring your own light bulbs. The lights thru out the condo are low wattage and not enough to read and relax with a glass of wine. Second, the toilet seats are the very cheap plastic kind, ( the ones that collapse when you sit on them) I know they could install wooden ones for a few dollars more.The water park is not included and I understand expensive. Most of their activities cost more money.Our check in was fast and even tho others claim they pressure you to buy a timeshare, this did not happen to us, when we said ""No"" at check in they accepted it. You will get phone calls asking but just say no. We visited President Jefferson, Monroe and Madison's home in the area (within an hour drive)and Luray Caverns which was awesome.","September 27, 2013","Woodstone at Massanutten, VA.

Shenandoah Valley,"If you love mountains and are driving east of the Mississippi river, then the Shenandoah valley is a sight to behold. The valley is actually subdivided for half its distance--bisected by the stunning Massanutten mountain which is a 2000+ foot mountain that stretches over 50 miles. Take I-81 and take Exit 264 at New Market, Virginia. Proceed on 211 East and go over the mountain. After you have cleared the mountain proceed on to the town of Luray. First, visit the famous Luray Caverns, which is one of the largest set of caverns in the United States. Then drive into the town of Luray. Stop your car. Look in front of you and look behind you. The mountain vistas are stunning. While it is not as dramatic as Colorado, the colors are incredible in mid-October as the leaves turn. You don't need a fee to see this beautiful site. Once you are done gawking continue up to 211 until you reach Shenandoah National Park at Thurston gap. (All national parks have an entrance fee). If you have time, proceed south towards Skyland and Big Meadows. This is where the most beautiful views in the park can be seen. The highest peak--Hawksbill mountain can be climbed fairly easily from the upper visitor parking lot. When you have completed your tour, exit either towards Luray or in the direction of Washington, D.C. via Warranton, VA. The feeling you will be left with is contentment and fulfillment--for natural beauty has is priceless.","September 16, 2013",Rare East Coast Mountain Beauty,41,"Falls Church, VA",5

Shenandoah Valley,We have been to a number of National Parks all over the USA and this was one I had always wanted to visit. Maybe I had too high expectations but driving in (this is August) you couldn't see more than 10 mtrs as it was so misty. The next day the mist hung lower over Luray and we had clear skies for a time and it was very pretty. We were at Skyland resort. The park is a ridgeway and you can see the towns below unlike places such as Yosemite or Bryce. There are some good trails but be careful as the mist can descend very quickly. The highlight was the butterflies they are the size of your hands and wonderfully coloured. Buy a book of the trails as they are accurate and don't try to do a walk that is over your ability - the books do not overestimate the difficulty of some of the trails. Bears are around too we didn't see any but peopel we spoke to had sighted some on a number of occasions.,"September 2, 2013",Good but not outstanding,62,,4
Shenandoah Valley,"Driving the 105-mile route of Skyline Drive was lovely. You can drive straight through in 3 hours or take many days. If you're not a hiker, there are 75 overlooks really worth seeing! We hiked a number of the shorter trails. We bought a book for $2.00 of the shorter trails and they were very good and accurate. We hiked with our dog and had a wonderfully exhausting time.","August 26, 2013",Wow! What a view!,38,"Amherst, NY",5
Shenandoah Valley,"We had a similar experience with a previous poster - someone decided to remove a decal from our car. Certainly not as bad as breaking in and taking a purse, but disappointing nonetheless. Seems that some of the locals think that they have a captive audience, when hikers park and hike for the day. The sometimes steep trail, however, rewarded us with great views at the top of the falls, in the Shenandoah National Park. The Mathews Arm campground (running water, but no showers) is just a couple of miles away, if you need water, or, conversely, you would like to hike to the falls while camping. We created a video of the hike, to share with those interested: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-ZQB6BoKRAThe next time, we will do the circuit, and hike down the other side of the falls, where there are reportedly pools for wading or swimming.The hike would have received five stars, but for the vandalism.","August 24, 2013",Thompson Falls Trail,46,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",4

Gorgeous setting with the orchestra playing in a protected pavilion and ample lawn seating is provided. Pack a picnic and bring your favorite wine to enjoy before and during the performance. One can experience beautiful views of the sun setting over the mountains while listening to classical pieces performed by the orchestra. A magical summer evening with cool temps.

Every trail we were on was appropriately rated and well-marked. Our very favorite hike was Old Rag Mountain. This was the only misinformation we had. Everything we read said it was 8 miles, but was really 10.5. Not that 2.5 miles mattered after this hike. It's every bit as difficult as advertised, but what a reward at the summit! Worth every step!

Shenandoah Valley,"We decided to take a July sanity/break, mini-vacation getaway. Seems we need more and more of these lately. Our travels took us to the beautiful Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. If you can take a couple of week days and tack it on to a weekend day, you’ll have a great mini-vacation. The week days were definitely better since there were definitely fewer visitor to the park. We headed down on Wednesday morning and arrived in Front Royal, which is really the Northern most part of Skyline drive. We hit Skyline caverns before starting our trip on Skyline Drive down to Luray. These caverns are interesting and we enjoyed the guided tour. The trip on Skyline Drive was outstanding. We pulled over at each overlook area to appreciate the awesome views. If you have a clear, sunny day you’ll be rewarded with incredible views of the Shenandoah Valley. Wow, this was the most beautiful stretch of road we have ever driven…..but, we haven’t made it out to the Rockies yet. There are plenty of overlooks and even if you stop for only a minute or two, hit them all. There ain’t a bad seat in the house folks. You’ll need a car pass to get into the park, but it was only $10 or $15….can’t remember. That gets you in and out of the park for a full week. The drive down to Luray is very scenic and it’s a nice little town. Be sure to see Luray Caverns which is really awe inspiring. This cavern definitely offers more spectacular formations compared to Skyline Caverns. Don’t miss it. You’ll also enjoy the car and history museum’s included in the ticket price. Our other trips into the park on Skyline drive took us to the big meadows and the visitor center which gives a good insight into the history of the park.","August 6, 2012",Shenandoah Valley - Skyline Drive - Luray,51,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",5
Shenandoah Valley,"We were given some advice from a local to hike the Thompson Hollow Trail in Bentonville, VA which is in Shenandoah National Park. Getting to the trail was tough in itself, it was not marked at all, no signs leading to it. We had to ask people along the way. When we finally got there there was a sign saying that a dirt road had access to the trail but it was difficult finding the trail because there were private roads all over saying ""no trespassing"" We finally found the trail and found the trails to be really pretty. HOWEVER, when we got back to the parking area 2 cars were broken into and one of them was ours. My wife's purse was stolen and we have spent the entire evening trying to cancel all the credit cards. What a disappointment. The lady from our hotel told us that Bentonville is a high crime area, wish we would have spoken to her earlier.
