Badlands National Park,"I had not been to the Black Hills area for several years and forgot how unique and beautiful the Badlands are. The colors on the fossil formations are beautiful AND you can drive right next to them, get out of your car, see them up close, and take memorable pictures. If you are in the area - it is a must visit and in my opinion underrated National Park.","October 17, 2019",Unique experience and underrated National Park,7,,5
Badlands National Park,"The entire time I was there I felt transported to another world. So often we overlook the beauty of our country and our planet and the US National Parks are some of the greatest scenic and history packed getaways on earth! I was especially excited to visit the Badlands and learn of how the prehistoric sea creatures once occupied this land to the days of fur traders and smugglers. Then to see it today...just in awe of the splendor, beauty and history that resides here. Can’t wait to return.","October 12, 2019",A Great Escape to the Moon,4,"Honolulu, Hawaii",5

Badlands National Park,"This was our second visit to the Badlands. The first was a rather quick drive thru however this time we were able to take our time and really soak in the scenery. If you have never been I would recommend allocating sufficient time to stop along the way, take photos and visit with the other travelers. If you just drive thru it doesn't take much time at all to go thru the loop however I suggest you take your time. We were very fortunate in that while we were there we we able to get a very close up view of a herd of Big Horned sheep crossing the loop road. Quite a sight. Highly recommend the Badlands for scenery and history.","September 29, 2019",Second visit,1,"Wichita Falls, Texas",5

Badlands National Park,"We spent only a few hours in the park while driving through South Dakota. We stopped at several viewpoints that had amazing views and unique formations. Most of the trails and boardwalks around the viewpoints were easy to navigate on foot and should be for a wheelchair as well, though there were some that may not be. There are longer trails in the park but we didn't hike any of them. Near the west entrance of the park we saw 2 bighorn sheep ewes and 3 bison. We saw hundreds of prairie dogs. We stopped for a late lunch at the Cedar Pass Lodge for a Sioux Indian Taco. The tacos were great, as big as the plate and very filling. If you're passing through this part of South Dakota and have a few hours to spare, I definitely recommend a stop.","September 21, 2019",Amazing Views and Unique Formations,215,"Kellyville, Oklahoma",4
Badlands National Park,"We arrived to the Badlands on August 25, 2019 and they were celebrating Founders Day so there was no fee to enter the park and the park was giving out cake and ice cream at the vistor center. The badland loop is 39 miles long and takes anywhere from 1 to 5 hours depending on how many stops you make. There are several trails that you can take but the 'watch out' for rattle snakes signs kept me from wandering to far from the road. The sunlight cast over the Badlands is incredible and changes from sunrise to sunset. Badlands are hot and dry so make sure you bring water for your trip. We saw birds, buffalo and bighorn sheep while on the Badlands loop","September 21, 2019",Badlands - Happy Founders Day,19,"Troy, Michigan",5
Badlands National Park,The national park provides a good display and explanation of the unusual landscape at the visitor's center. The Badlands Loop goes through the heart of the park and provides many places to pull off and soak in the scenery. There are also many hiking trails along the route with parking and rest rooms.

Badlands National Park,"My husband, a friend and I spent 4 hours at Badlands National park in late August. The park was beautiful and interesting. We saw bighorn sheep at the Door Trailhead and on a hill at the Yellow Mounts overlook. We saw deer at the northeast entrance fee booth. Prairie dogs were everywhere. We did not see any bison, pronghorn or snakes although they are in the park. We took several short trails. Our favorite was the Door Trail. It was an easy boardwalk about 0.75 of a mile long. The Window trail is shorter and an easy trail as well. I got a slight sunburn so wear sunscreen. The Ben Reifel Visitor Center had a small museum, gift shop, fossil area and nice restrooms. The visitor center could use more picnic tables. This park is certainly not to be missed.","September 18, 2019","Interesting, nice short trails, bighorn sheep, prairie dogs and deer",631,"Austin, Texas",5
Badlands National Park,"The visitors center was very nice with park related merchandise, a movie about the animals in the area in the past, and park rangers to give information. It was a nice drive on a paved road with many places to pull over and take photos. There are hiking trails for those who want to hike. There is a drive to go see the prairie dog town. We saw bison, but only off in the distance.","September 16, 2019",Great Views,71,"Downers Grove, Illinois",4
Badlands National Park,We spent a day here on our drive home. It’s so beautiful! We saw bison in the grassland area at the entrance roaming. In the park we saw big horn sheep.

If you are in the area it’s worth spending a few hours here.,"September 16, 2019",A must see!,136,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",5
Badlands National Park,"Wow! So much to see and what interesting natural beauty. 75 million years ago, the middle of America was under water. Today, we can see what it looked like under there. Incredible landscapes many looking like sand castles with brilliant pinks, greens, greys and sand colored rocks. A tour you should do on a sunny day. We attempted it on a rainy day and the fog settled in so we turned back. But on a glorious blue sky day, this is spectacular.","September 15, 2019",A view to the past,25,,5

Badlands National Park,"First of all, the rangers were friendly even though it was really busy, they answered all our questions and gave us more information as well. We “hiked” the Door Trail and the Cliff Shelf Trail before the Visitor’s Center and even with a 6 yo we loved it. My 6 yo had no problems with either trail, but if you have a runner, I would skip at least the Door trail or they may run right off a cliff. The Visitor’s Center was informative and interesting, but I felt like something was lacking(although I couldn’t tell you what). We drove the Loop and stopped several times to take pictures, but they don’t compare to the views my eyes are still viewing. I am in awe at the majestic, colorful formations that dot the landscape. We then took the Sage Creek Road all the way through and saw mountain goats, prairie dogs, birds, and a few far off ( which was fine with us) bison. If I had one place to go over and over again it would be this park! This is a smack yourself for not going here place! ","September 13, 2019",My eyes are still there-WOW,0,"Belleville, Illinois",5

Paying $25 to enter (we had purchased the annual pass)) We stopped off at the Indian Trading Post before entering the park proper along the loop road. There are many stopping places where you are able to get out of the car, stretch your legs and take photos. The journey took roughly a hour and a half. Would recommend.","September 9, 2019",Wilderness,295,"Farnborough, United Kingdom",4
Badlands National Park,"Two adults visited this park in mid-August and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Started at the Ben Reifel Visitor Center. Probably spent two plus hours there. Short film, paleontology fossil lab, and interesting exhibits. Attended the morning ranger talk at the Fossil Exhibit Trail head. She spoke for maybe 20 minutes. Very informative. Spent the rest of the day exploring the Badlands Loop Road and the Sage Creek Rim Road (unpaved). Saw maybe five or six bison, a small herd of pronghorn antelope, and lots of prairie dogs. Great day and a half.","September 9, 2019",Great park,99,,5
Badlands National Park,"This is an awesome place to visit and drive through. Our first trip through we stopped too many times to mention to take pictures and to just stand in awe of the beautiful rugged terrain. It is truly a work of art by Mother Nature. It is a must see trip if traveling anywhere near Wall, South Dakota. Our second trip through, we saw the prairie dogs, one even posed for me, and the big horn sheep just before and just after the entrance to the park. We went through the second time purely to enjoy the scenery without the hassle of picture taking. The park pass is good for a couple of days so it’s worth the second or even third trip. So much to see!","September 8, 2019",Awesome sights,16,"Ingleside, Illinois",5

Badlands National Park,Visited the Badlands as part of our Trafalgar Tour Western Frontiers. There are no words to describe what I would call this “mysterious” site. You must see & experience it. There is a pathway boardwalk to follow & you can walk on the sand/rocky ground; there are markers placed in the ground to prevent anyone getting lost. There does not seem to be any restrictions on how deep you can walk into the site. It is understandable why this area may eventually wear down due to the soft consistency of the rock. Incredible place to visit.,"September 3, 2019",Very Unusual Place,35,"Williamsburg, Virginia",5
Badlands National Park,"Badlands offer amazing rock formations, great (although mostly short) hiking trails, possibilities to explore wildland, watching praire dogs (which I could sit and do for hours) and even possibility to meet some bison. I recommend short trails (some broadwalks), specially the Notch Trail (a bit harder yet short). Also drive through the scenic loop. But reserve some time to just sit and watch. You will need it :)","September 2, 2019",What a great place to visit!,104,"Richmond, Virginia",5
Badlands National Park,The landscape is rolling hills and valleys of subtlely colored rock layers gently graded. Some goats and other animals can sometimes be spotted.

It’s beauty warrants a gem attraction rating in its own right.,"August 31, 2019",A rainbow of colors,2,,4
Badlands National Park,The scenery is magnificent. It is hard to turn a corner without seeing something even more grand than the last scene that you saw. The management by the NPS is excellent.

Badlands National Park,"Indescribable nature, better come see for yourself. The many viewpoints long the road are well worth a stop. We followed the easily accessible 240 road, but chose not to drive the Sage Creek Rim Rd because it is a gravel road. We saw a lot of wildlife including three large male buffalos and a big herd of bighorn sheep.

Badlands National Park,"We arrived at Badlands this afternoon and the landscapes were incredibly impressive. There are many lookouts to take exquisite photos and areas to walk around to get a variety of views. It took us about 2.5 hours to go through the Badlands loop and if we weren't time constrained could have easily spent more time. The visitors center provides a very compact but detailed set of displays about the geology, history and animal life. By far, Badlands National Park was the highlight of our South Dakota/Wyoming vacation.","August 22, 2019",Nature at its best,39,"Mahwah, New Jersey",5
Badlands National Park,"One day was barely enough to get a flavor of the park and only in the more popular north unit where the Ben Reifel Visitors Center is located. While at the visitors center take the time to explore the Fossil Room where you can see staff working on fossil preparation and get an overview of the geology and fossils found in the park. The rangers at the information desk can also suggest hikes and drives to meet specific interests. The short Fossil Trail coupled with a ranger presentation there, including samples of fossils found in the park, helped give an overview of how the landscape was formed. The Door Trail is easy, beginning on a boardwalk before continuing onto the rock formations where there's no defined path and the trail is marked by colored posts you make you way to by the most convenient way for you.The Notch Trail includes a rather steep climb up a log ladder with the trail continuing close to the edge of a canyon. It's not recommended for someone with a fear of heights, but the valley view at the end is spectacular.","August 22, 2019",Badlands National Park in one day,1,"Malvern, Pennsylvania",5
Badlands National Park,"I still can't get over the beauty of this park. The expansive views, the prairie dogs, the big horn sheep and the beautiful yellow mounds, I would go there again in a minute.

Badlands National Park,"We visited the Badlands National Park on a lifetime senior pass to the national parks. We came through the southeast entrance, visited the nearby trails, then hiked about 8 miles on the Castle trail. Breathtaking sights - dunes, hills, and grasslands. Highlight was seeing up close 3 big horn sheep. We returned the next afternoon via the loop scenic parkway, entering from near Wall SD. Again awesome sights, especially the Yellow Mounds. Hiked 4 miles from the west side of the Castle Trail. Returned a 3rd day , hiking to the end of the Door Trail, having great views of ravines.

Badlands National Park,We drove the highway 240 loop road from the Wall turn off to the exit back on to interstate 90 near Kadoka in the early morning hours! We was disappointed we did not see any wildlife but a scenic landscape that changed as we drove the good roads with limited traffic! The pull offs to take pictures was great but the pit-toilet bathrooms were awful! We returned to the Badlands after a visit to the nearby 1880 town and took a different route (highway 44) back to Rapid City in hopes of seeing more wildlife but we did not! There is another route of paved road we did not take and some gravel roads so maybe that is what you will need to take to view the wildlife . The different times of day and weather does make for an forever changing landscape!

There are many scenic stops along the way, which are well marked with interpretative exhibits and placards:- Fossil Exhibits Trail-White River Valley Overlook- Panorama Point- Yellow Mounts Overlookand many other stops along the loop.There are pinnacles, buttes, multi-color stratified mounds, and many fossil sites showing prehistoric and now extinct animals.

Called to change our site to electric and the gal assured me we were find and she'd leave a note to have the site reserved for us for our 3 night stay. When we arrived the site was given to someone else. No electric sites left....however the electric site behind us had a reserved sign on it and no one even showed up. So for 3 nights are RV had no electric when the site behind us went empty....mind you it was hot every day. Like I said great park and worth seeing and enjoying but campground management needs some work. ,"August 11, 2019",Awesome place to visit,6,,4
Badlands National Park,Badlands National Park is a must see when touring South Dakota. The geological formations are incredible. You will be startled by the views at every turn.

Badlands National Park,"We drove the ""loop"" and went 2 days. The first day starting at the ""bottom"" part of the loop and the following day we started at Wall. We stopped quite a few times to walk paths and take photos and video. If you go in the mornings the chances of seeing wild life is better than going during the middle of the day.

We got out to “play” a bit at the fossil trail which had many people there stretching their legs and off for a climb.

Badlands National Park,"Badlands national park as the name suggests is very dry and rough place but offers you many excellent views. Rock formed are very unique having different colourful patterns. It was cold in the day which we never expected so make sure to have jackets with you. There are many points in the drive to learn about the formations and take pictures. Generally it takes around 1 hour to complete the loop but we spent around 4-5 hours there. Hiking treks are there and toilet facilities are also good. You won’t find anything to eat nearby so make sure to have food and water with you. Visitor centre (Ben Reifel) is at a very good location, we spotted a pack of deers roaming around but they don’t have anything to eat or drink (coffee).we spotted prairie dogs, big horn sheep, bisons and wild sheep in group.

When we pulled in off of the road from Wall, we turned right onto the dirt road. There was a herd of big horn sheep out. We pulled over got out and took a bunch of pictures of them. We got back in and drove further and right in the road and beside the road was a herd of bison. We STAYED in the car and took a bunch of pics. We came back the next day and drove to the left of that road on the paved road and hiked some trails. We pulled over at a bunch of look outs and climbed on the rocks. We also went off the Fossile board trail and hiked the rocks to the right. We went back in a bowl type area and there were two rams back there. So amazing! Later, we saw the Prairie Dog Town (Other side of park on the dirt road).","July 31, 2019",Badlands is a must for families who love to climb and hike on rock formations,8,"Champaign, Illinois",5

We hiked two trails - the Notch Trail which has a log ladder you climb - shows strenuous, but it was not so hard and worth it, and the Cliff Shelf Nature Trail, which was shorter and easier. The prairie dogs are so cute and there is a stop where you can feed them with purchased food. Highly recommend visiting this incredible area!","July 30, 2019",Unbelievable!,15,"Houston, Texas",5

You can get the full effect by staying in your car or there are several places where you can get a fantastic overview and stand at the edge of a huge drop-off or you can hike as far as you dare into this surreal natural rock formation.

I would highly recommend getting a guide to truly understand just what you are seeing but it is not necessary for just admiring its beauty. We used GeoFun Trek tours, and I would highly recommend them. The beware of rattlesnakes sign is a little off putting but we didn’t encounter any.

It is well worth a few hours to explore a couple trails and drive the loop.","July 9, 2019",Beautiful Badlands,171,"Muskego, WI",5
Badlands National Park,"We had a great time in the Badlands. It’s a “hike where you like park” so you can really get right into it and experience the buttes and other geologic formations. As National parks go, there aren’t a ton of mid-range hiking trails, so you either need to do all of the shorter ones, or create your own. My family (dad, mom, 12 yo, and 9 yo) loved scrambling over the rocks/dirt and looking for fossils. We even found one small vertebra on our last hike. I would definitely recommend this park for families that like to get off the trail, but aren’t full blown backpackers.","July 8, 2019",Good time in the Badlands,4,,5

There are numerous places to pull off the road, get out of the car, hike, and take in all of the beauty in every direction. We started on the east and headed west. There were elevated rock formations of many colors. As we made our way west, the elevated formations gave way to canyons. Amazing.

Every once in a while you just stop and listen to the quiet. We noticed that there has been at least one change since we were here in 2004. There is now a helicopter ride that flies over the park giving tourists an aerial view. We found this annoying and it breaks the silence and seclusion you were feeling before the chopper flies overhead. I know there are helicopter tours over other National Parks. I wish the National Park Service would review that policy. The loud chopping noise of the helicopter ruins the experience for most of the Park visitors.

However, we took the Sage Creek Rim Road back to the Black Hills. While it's a dirt road, it's very well maintained with a lot more to see than I90, including bison, prairie dogs and even a cattle roundup in our case.

Badlands National Park,"If you’re traveling to South Dakota, the Badlands are a must see and do. Words of advice before you go, make sure you have a tank of gas. Depending on if you’re hiking or just driving through, the park is vast and there isn’t a gas station within the park although there are a couple on the road that leads in. There aren’t enough words to describe this seemingly alien landscape. You’ll enter the park at one of the toll areas and either pay the $25 entrance fee or use your America the Beautiful pass to get in. From there, the roads lead you on a journey of splendor and amazement. A good place to begin is at the Ben Reifel visitor center, where there are tons of exhibits about how the Badlands formed, restrooms, a theater, and a large gift shop. The desk is where you can get your NPS passport stamped. From there, it’s up to you on how you’d like to continue. Grab a map from one of the park rangers. The great thing about the Badlands is if you’re not into hiking you can drive the entirety of the park and stop at the overlooks to get great scenic views. If you’re the adventurous type, ask the park rangers which trails would best suite the amount of time you plan on spending and the physicality level of each. From the visitor center you’ll drive to either the overlooks or the beginning of the trail you’ve picked. Whatever you do pack plenty of water and snacks if you’re hiking. The environment is so vast it’s borderline scary and yet so peaceful to be sitting in the middle of nowhere among these geological formations. My advice if you don’t have an entire day to spend, hit the Notch Trail as it’s one of the shortest but gives you a great idea of what the terrain is like, then stop at the Pinnacles and Yellow Mounds overlooks which are so different than the hiking areas but so unique in their own beauty.

We drove the loop through the Park, which is fairly short but could easily take an entire day. We stopped at every vista. Each one was special in it's own way. There are several trails offered. Walk them.Before entering the park at Wall stop and watch the Prairie Dogs, there are scores of them on either side of the gate. This is also where we saw the buffalo. A great day trip.","May 6, 2019",Visit another world.,38,"Columbia, South Carolina",5

We saw a lot and it took maybe 3-4 hours. We took in 3 of the walking trails- all were lovely and featured different aspects of the park. We also stopped at 4 scenic lookouts. We skipped 2 or 3 trails because the trailhead description suggested they would be either longer or more strenuous than we were up to. There were places for kids to run and explore, and lots of animals on the roads! Just do it!","May 5, 2019",Just do it!,27,"Saskatoon, Canada",5

Please keep in mind that you shouldn't get close to wild animals...for example do NOT get out of your car to take a pic of a Bison. You can earn a Junior Ranger badge and if you want to hike check out a visitor center for trails, maps and advice. You can also see fossils in their lab, there is a restaurant and gift shop there as well. Plan for the day and bring lunch or check out the restaurant.","April 26, 2019","Amazing park, lots of hiking, climbing and beautiful sunsets.",20,,5
Badlands National Park,"This is a must see area if you have the opportunity. You can take an exit off the I-90 and do the Badlands Loop on highway 240. It’s about a 40 mile loop around but will take you some time if you want to stop at all the viewpoints along it to see the stunning scenery! The day cost to enter the park for a car is $25. If you are 62 and over and a US citizen, you will pay $20 for the day pass. The loop will bring you out again on the I-90 about 20 miles ahead of where you entered. The scenery was amazing! Be prepared for a sensory overload of beauty!! We also saw lots of Bighorn sheep along the way. Highly recommend!!","April 26, 2019",Awesome scenery!,34,Canada,5

Badlands National Park,"My mother wanted to see Badlands so we planned a road trip vacation around it with great anticipation. We visited on a Saturday in June after exploring the nearby Minuteman Missile Historic Site in the morning. Our route took us east to west on the scenic Loop Road through the North Unit of the park, from I-90 exit 131 to exit 110 at Wall (about 38 miles). This two-lane paved road curves up and down along the edge of the eroded cliff ""wall"" and should be passable for all vehicles. The park is open 24/7, and entrance fees or NPS passes are required ($25/car, $15/motorcycle, $12/hiker or bicycle, valid 7 days). We spent about 4 hours in the park, which included stopping at the scenic viewpoints for photos, taking 3-4 short walks, exploring the Ben Reifel Visitor Center, and eating lunch. The eroded rock formations are wondrous as advertised, whimsical carvings with horizontal bands of color from yellow to red streaked through. This unique landscape covers many miles and is easy to see from the road. We saw bison, bighorn sheep, and prairie dogs along the way. The day was bright and sunny but extremely windy - windy enough to blow us off balance - so that put a damper on the experience. The park was also fairly crowded, but not to the point that there were traffic jams or lack of parking. The main frustration that the crowd of tourists caused for me was the number people who were climbing about, all over the formations, trying to get the perfect selfie. I couldn't look anywhere and see the natural, pristine terrain without people in it, or the sad evidence of their passing. Those straying off the designated pathways with abandon have left social footpaths everywhere in the fragile ecosystem. I was appalled at the lack of respect shown for this protected natural area, and saddened by the obvious impact it's having. Several designated hiking trails are available that vary in length and difficulty so there's no excuse for this blatant desecration. There aren't a lot of services in the area, mainly at Cedar Pass Lodge (open summer only) next to the Ben Reifel Visitor Center, or at the town of Wall. You may want to consider a picnic; we ate lunch at the lodge and I don't recommend it (see separate review). There are 4 picnic areas, at the 2 visitor centers, at Big Foot Pass, and at Conata near Yellow Mounds. The Ben Reifel Visitor Center has educational exhibits, souvenirs and restrooms. Hours of operation vary with the seasons but it's always open at least 8:00am to 4:00pm except on the holidays of Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's. Additional restrooms are available throughout the park at several of the viewpoints. Wheelchair accessibility is good at the lodge and visitor centers, and there are level boardwalks at Door Trail, Window Trail, and the Fossil Exhibit Trail. These are only about .25 mile long and not difficult. There is very little shade in this park so be prepared with hat, sunglasses and sunscreen. Note that leashed pets are allowed in the park but only in developed areas (parking, campground, picnic site) NOT on hiking trails.","March 20, 2019",Scenic Drive Through Extraordinary Eroded Landscape,1781,"Tucson, Arizona",4

Let me just tell all of you that it was beautiful, the formations had a light dusting of snow on them and they were amazing . The loop we took started off slow with looking at and getting up close to the formations then the Super Wildlife Show started ! Being from the east we have White Tail Deer and Black Bears and the occasional Racoon, but once we rounded the first bend by the Visitors Center (very nice ranger by the way) we happened upon a large group of Mule Deer then Big Horn Sheep everywhere, close enough to enjoy and photograph ! We even saw a couple colonies of disease ridden prairie dogs (my daughters loved them the most I think ) .

Badlands National Park,"Badlands National Park is located east of Rapid City and just south of I-90 which provides excellent access near the small city of Wall and while it is not as spectacular as some of the other National Parks, it is nevertheless well worth a visit of at least four hours, but preferably six hours or more. We would recommend entering the park at its eastern entrance, near Big Badlands Overlook, and driving the 27 mile (43k), paved Loop road through the park to the western entrance, near the Pinnacles Overlook, as it appears that the Park Service laid out the location of the visitor center, stops and the interpretation to flow better in this direction.Allowing at least six hours to visit provides one with enough time to stop at most of the overlooks along the Loop road; hike at least one short trail such as the Door Trail (0.50 to 0.75 mile / 0.8 to 1.2k roundtrip) which allows one to truly experience the Badlands; to watch the park film and view the exhibits featuring the natural history of the Badlands and the fossils found in the rich fossil beds found here at the excellent visitor center; and possibly a side trip, on the maintained dirt road beyond the Pinnacles Overlook, to visit the Roberts prairie dog town.As the Loop road travels past the best part of the spectacular geological formation known as the Badlands Wall, by the 12 major pullouts offering differing views of the Badlands formations and the surrounding prairie, be sure to keep an eye out for wildlife as there is a surprising amount for a place that truly looks like “badland”.

Badlands National Park,"So why Badlands? Besides the Amazing views of course.As usual, my first stop was at the White River Visitor Center.The main reason as to why - the very friendly and hospitable ranger said I can make my own trails. You are allowed to park where you see nice views and just discover it. You are allowed to climb up the buttes, down the buttes, up a hill, round the hill, just watch your step. Endless Trails!So I will not review the trails offered by the Park, just offer my parking spots for Trekking.Made camp at Sage Campground. Will be reviewed separately.I think the first thing to do is just drive through the park, soak the amazing views and colors and there are so many of them.After that you can decide what area you would like to venture.To be honest, I'm not a winter kinda person and the forecast looked completely different to what I actually got.Temps were 45 at the highest, winds and the worst was rain.If you plan on trekking, be sure to catch dry days, cause the mud makes ur shoes into stilettos and it's almost impossible to walk there.Anyways, as I've written before, since you are the one deciding where to go, watch ur step... Weather it's Bison poop (loads of those) or uneven ground that is covered by vegetation.Roberts Prairie Dog Town is a great parking spot. After watching the Cute Prairie Dogs Show, Cross the road, find the butte the suits you best to descent and loop to the other side.Another great spot to park is Pinnacles Overlook.A great spot for a Picnic is Conata. You can have a snack, use the toilet and go on another beautiful trail.Wildlife is abandoned and beautiful. Keep watch, they tend to show at all hours.Although SD is pretty far for me, I'm for sure, coming back.Pics say it allEnjoy ","October 2, 2018",Speechless and Got a Lot to Say 😊,65,"Los Angeles, California",5
Badlands National Park,"Had this on my bucket list for the past few years and finally went in late September. It was beautiful; I kept saying ""amazing"" the whole time. We got the hike list from the people at the Gift Center/Cabin reservation area & it was very helpful as we didn't have set plans when we arrived. We did 2 of the shorter hikes and one which connected with the longer Castle hike; we did about a mile of Castle and it was great. Scenery exceeded any expectations we had. If you have good weather, I think you can easily do Badlands in less that a day & then see other area attractions if desired.","October 1, 2018",Amazing scenery,10,"New York City, New York",5
Badlands National Park,"There is an entrance fee to the park, like many national parks. But this is one of those areas that is a must-do in the area!! There are mountain formations and valleys like I have never seen! There were colors that I have never seen in rock (yellow!?) -- and the expanse of the land was enormous. All along the drive, there are paved parking areas. When you see one - stop and park. There are plenty of beautiful sites and even walkways for trails. There is even one where ancient fossils were found! There is a museum/gift shop that is not to be missed. They have a short film about the Badlands which help explain the beautiful lands. When you have a choice to drive out of the park or continue onto Sage road - take Sage.

Still saw many pretty views though! ,"September 20, 2018",Vast beauty,27,"Krum, Texas",5

We were able to observe wildlife, see some great landscape, and interesting foliage. The fossil lab at the Visitor Center was top notch! It was great for us to talk to the paleontologists as they worked in front of us! The movie was informative. The park rangers were friendly and helpful. I will say the visitor center promptly closes as advertised. We slid in with 10 minutes to spare, and they were turning out lights right at closing time! We managed to grab a junior ranger book and come back the next day at a more leisurely pace. The yellow mounds formations were especially interesting. The picnic areas were wonderful! They were shaded and guarded from the windy day. Loved this park!","September 19, 2018",Amazing views...underrated park!,11,"Port Orange, Florida",5

The formations are so interesting and the landscape of this park is unusual. We just took a quick trip through the viewing loop and a few photos, but it was great and I'd like very much to see it again in nicer weather. Two quick comments - when you get to the dirt road portion of the park I'd recommend skipping it. We went a little way and it was pretty rough (and we have a Land Rover). Also, be sure you EAT. There is one restaurant in the park and very little else in terms of food around on the way there. We were starving by the time we got there.","September 12, 2018",Pictures can't give you the idea of this place - really beautiful!,21,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Badlands National Park,"All I can say is that the pictures you see online do not quite do justice of the real experience of being at this park. The time of day and weather affects and morphs the beauty this park has to offer. If you’re short on time, take the 240 loop (scenic byway)-it takes about an hour to get a quick view of the park. Since you’re already here, you might as well spend all day at the park. It’s beautiful, scary and awe inspiring at the same time.","September 10, 2018",Wow,27,"Kansas City, Kansas",5

Badlands National Park,"My wife and I spent a full day at Badlands National Park last week as we toured the Dakotas. What a great place! The canyons and vistas are awe inspiring and we felt that we saw most of what we wanted to in our trip there. Being fairly remote, Badlands does not get the crowds one finds at Grand Canyon and Yellowstone. It is located about an hour's drive east of Rapid City.Wildlife abounds here and we say plenty of pronghorn sheep and prairie dogs as well as a few coyotes soon after we entered. The loop road which goes for about 30 miles winds its way around this massive park and has plenty of stops at the best overlooks like Panorama where one can gaze at the timeless semi-desert scenery. We hiked two trails, the Notch and Castle trails and also the fossil nature walk trail. It wasn't blazing hot, but in the mid 80's, so the hiking was not that strenuous and very rewarding. We also stopped at the visitor center in the middle of the park. It featured an introductory movie, helpful rangers, a small gift shop and there is a restaurant at a lodge next door.

What we found was a completely interactive park, where you can explore, scramble and climb, restricted only by your own physical limitations. Great views are accessible to all, however, no matter what your capability. We also saw some bison, antelope and prairie dogs and met a lot of friendly people. This park is a must-see.

Badlands National Park,"I did not know much about the Badlands before planning our trip to South Dakota. I love visiting National Parks so since we were going to visit Mount Rushmore anyway I decided to add Badlands to our itinerary. While the weather wasn't perfect when we went, I'm glad that we did. Here are a few notes about it:* The Badlands are about 1 hour east of Rapid City. Very easy to get there. Saw lots of deer and pronghorn on the drive over.*Admission is $15 or $20 (don't remember). It is worth it.*Definitely do the Scenic Highway through the park.*While there are multiple stops throughout the Badlands, DEFINITELY do the Pinnacles Overlook and the Big Badlands Overlook. The views are amazing. These were my 2 favorites.* The Visitor Center is pretty good but it was crowded.*The Window ""trail"" is REALLY short. I wish we had time to do the Door one as it looked...like more exploration and a challenge.*The Fossil Exhibit walk is ok too. It is a trail of fossil displays around a boardwalk loop. I thought it would be cooler than it actually was (as these displays could easily just be put in the visitor center instead, but it's ok).*Saw LOTS of wild goats/rams at the Pinnacles Overlook. Pretty cool. There were at least 10-15.*Past the Pinnacles Overlook there is a stretch of highway that goes toward the town of Wall and back to the main highway or you can continue west toward another section of the park. This western section of the park (that goes toward a prairie dog town) was closed when we were there in June. Maybe it is a seasonal offering (?) so plan ahead if visiting this area was in your plans.*I don't know how hot it gets here (it was an overcast day in June when we went so it was probably 60s-early 70s when we went), but there is VERY minimal trees and shade here. Maybe bring some protective covering if you are going during a hotter season?*There is the nearby Minuteman Missile Historic Site nearby that is also run by the NPS. It is a great, interesting stop. We were easily able to visit both places within the same day. If you are into history you may enjoy that place too.","August 27, 2018",Surreal Place,158,"Honolulu, Hawaii",5

Even more amazing is walking through the soft ground to the scenic overlooks for beautiful panoramic camera views. Because of the soft ground, you might want to wear sturdy shoes with good traction even for short walks. Countless prairie dogs and their dens are visible along a stretch of plateau on Rt. 240. We could hear them calling to one another in the distance. If you hustle along, you can see the entire park, including all overlooks, in a half-day. Lunch at the Cedar Pass Lodge (near the East terminus) was nothing special, but the food was good. (Visitors are captive clientele for Cedar Pass as there's nowhere else to eat for miles.)

Badlands National Park,"I wasn't sure what to expect at Badlands, but it was a pleasure around every turn. Amazing scenery, rock formations and wildlife abound. We pulled off the road in several locations to take photos and walk down a trail to see what was around the corner. It is amazing what different type of views you have all around the loop. The park is well maintained with good roads, ample turnoffs and interactive areas with park rangers. We spent about 2 1/2 hours and could have spent another 2. A really wonderful experience. Tip: If you want to climb up a rock formation or two you can certainly do so, but the soft surface easily breaks away so be careful not to lose your footing.","August 13, 2018",Amazing Vistas around Every Turn,159,"Bristol, WI",5
Badlands National Park,"Imagine that you're at the beach as a kid and you're building all kinds of sand castles. Now, imagine that you're a grownup and you're in South Dakota. You get off of I-90 and soon you see that your sand castles have gotten bigger as you have gotten bigger. You have entered Badlands National Park, and the sand castles run for miles and are a wonderful lesson in geology. It looks as if they will wash away in the next big thunderstorm. In fact, they do lose about one inch off the tops of the castles per year, which is unheard of in geology.The loop road runs for miles and the scenery constantly changes and is always beautiful. My wife and I never got tired of looking at it. There are several hikes, some very short and some much longer.There is lots of wildlife, but, of course, you can't always see it. We did see tons of prairie dogs, which are always a treat to see.If you go to Badlands NP, make sure you make a real tour of southwest South Dakota as this is rather a remote region to visit. Wind Cave National Park, Mt. Rushmore, Crazy Horse Memorial, and 1880 Town are other attractions. Also, make sure you stop at Wall Drug for a real treat.,","August 13, 2018",Big Sand Castles,32,"Naples, Florida",5
Badlands National Park,"We spent a little over 5 hours here and thoroughly enjoyed it. We did several short hikes, enjoyed the scenery, and stopped for a picnic lunch. The Saddle Pass trail was fun and scenic. The Window Trail and the Door Trail were fun, too, and not too difficult. We saw bighorn sheep crossing the road on our way out to the Northeast Exit. We found out that the bison are only in the area by the Sage Creek Road, which is a gravel road, not paved. We did not drive into this section. It was hot, so bring water and sunscreen.

Badlands National Park,"Wind, water, land and adequate time combine to create unimaginable landscape drama. The July afternoon we stopped in must have been among the hottest days on record. Still, the beauty overwhelms. If you have the luxury of planning an early morning visit, or at the time of evening sunset, or during snow, or fog, those times might be all the better. But it's hard not to be impressed--no matter the season or time of day. I'm sure a moonlit night must be amazing. And speak with a ranger or guide while there, as learning the story of how the Badlands came to be lends to an even greater appreciation of the beauty. One nice aspect is that you can hike right into it, not just a ""view from a distance"" feature.","August 8, 2018",The Wonders of Geology,22,"Hillsborough, North Carolina",5

Badlands National Park,"Went to South Dakota on 4th of July weekend to see five national parks/monuments in five days. Badlands was almost an after thought.... I wasn’t expecting it to be much, except for “bad.”I was surprised that it was just as interesting as all the other sandstone national parks that I visited in Utah.... such as Brice, Zion, Canyons, or Arches. It was a very interesting trip, especially since the ranger told us that it was ok to walk “anywhere” we wanted. Hiked around, climbed every place I felt like climbing and saw many interesting sights. There were some crazy places that I saw a few people climbing but I didn’t have any interest in doing that. Had an interesting ranger walk where he lectured us about all the people that they needed to evacuate by chopper after they fell off a rock... and then gave us an interesting tour of where they were processing fossil bones. Nice visitor center.I had low expectations but it turned out to be one of the highlites of the trip.","August 5, 2018",A huge surprise!,52,"San Jose, California",5

Our time in the Badlands consisted of the Ben Reifel Visitor Center (about 45 minutes), Window Trail (about 15 minutes), Door Trail (30 minutes), Notch Trail (1 hour), Cliff Shelf Trail (45 minutes), Big Badlands Overlook, the Fossil Exhbiit Trail (15 minutes), the Badlands Loop Road (2 hours, including the 10 overlooks, a couple of which included some short hikes), and a bit of the Sage Creek Rim Road (including Roberts Prairie Dog Town) (45 minutes); we ate dinner at the Cedar Pass Lodge and spent the night at the Badlands Budget Host motel so that we could arrive later in the day and get an early start the next morning, but our trip could also have been done as a daytrip.","August 2, 2018",Awesome visit to the Badlands,244,"Tampa, Florida",5

On the Northwest part of the loop are fields of bison (literally hundreds of them), prairie dogs, and mule deer! The drive on the southern and eastern portion are spectacular!

And as we drove through we just couldn't believe what we were seeing. There are many places to pull in and park and get out of the car and walk around and also places to just pull over and look.

Badlands National Park,"We stayed at Customer State Park for vacation and took one day to go to Badlands.. must see. So fascinating. First of all, we came from Nebraska on drive and wish we had stopped at Badlands on way into South Dakota.. but I digress. So coming from Custer State park, first stop was at Wall Drug first and had lunch. Wall Drug is maybe hour at most visit to say you did it, but really touristy. So on to Badlands.. get there early if hot as it is VERY hot. Stopped at the Prairie Dog park driving from Wall Drug.. out in middle of nowhere on rough road but very cool. It's really just a stop on side of road where hundreds of mounds of Prairie Dogs live. No idea why it is named as nothing there but the prairie dogs.. but cool. Then we visited the various Outshoots set up to see the Badlands. So fascinating. I made my kids read about it before hand to understand what created it. We had elderly person with us so limited what we could do, but I think hiking would have been cool.  We stopped at four stops (coming in from where the Prairie Dog town is)... and it was beautiful. Many goats and their babies there too. Great pics and just so hard to imagine seeing this out in the middle of South Dakota. I wish we could have visited the visitor center to read more.. but with 90 year old and a 3 year old, driving and getting out to look for 15-20 minutes was good. Lots of dust and again, pretty warm day we went... average crowds but not bad.  So important we value these natural wonders. Go on clear day if you can! I said 2-3 hours but you could spend the entire day if you visited visitor centers and hiked. We just had wrong ages to do that.","July 27, 2018",Must see,12,New Jersey,5

The Badlands National Park, these formations and walkouts were some of the most interesting water/erosion sites I have witnessed. Sad to think that in the future they will not exist because of the constant erosion. Upon entering the park about five miles in, there is an information center with maps and history of this master piece. Most important is not to miss the small area on the SD and WY borders of this national park called Devils Tower, most impressive and sacraed for all who love creation.","July 24, 2018",Exploring SD eassential 8 must see and experience,10,"Memphis, Tennessee",5

For the notch trail, be sure to wear sneakers with great, gripping tread or hiking boots, because you will be climbing on the rock at times. Also there’s a steep log ladder at one point to get up to another point of the hike. It brings you out to a big vista of the Badlands including prairie lands.After the three hikes, we did the 31 mile scenic drive.

Lots of fun, but the need to always be aware of your surroundings to stay safe.Lodging in the park includes campgrounds and cabins. There appeared to be only 26 cabins, so plan well in advance if you would like to stay there. We booked one year ahead. The cabin accommodations were excellent and included a refrigerator, air conditioning, and outside porch seating. They were spacious and comfortable.

We had a very windy night with a lightning storm that wouldn't quit. Fortunately, no rain! However, we hardly slept a wink. Excellent ranger talk with Ranger Ed at the amphitheater followed by a stargazing talk with a park volunteer. We ate dinner at the Lodge (open until 8:30), which was much appreciated because it was extremely hot, still, and buggy at dinnertime. We also got coffee to go at 7:00 a.m. from the same restaurant. Bathrooms at the campground were super buggy.The park itself is otherworldly and amazing. You are encouraged to explore any part of it and can climb on the rock formations, which surprised us when the ranger told us that. We drove in on tertiary roads from the south which were gravel and very tough on the mini van. We did this to save time, but it was tough going, and in hindsight, we wouldn't do that again.The good part of it was we got to visit the south visitor center and met a Native American jewelry maker who shared some cool information with us.

Badlands National Park,"We visited Badlands at the end of our Dakota's national parks road trip. We had reservations for a campsite at Cedar Pass Campgrounds. The bathrooms and showers are in the center of the grounds, so every site has easy access to the facilities. In the summer, you must have reservations; don't expect to show up and have sites available for the day like other parks.We enjoyed the scenic drive and saw lots of wildlife! Buffalo, big horn sheep, prairie dogs...and the views are best at sunset (and I would imagine sunrise but I was in the tent at that time!). We did the Notch Trail, Window Trail, Door Trail, Fossil Trail (I think that's what it was called) and part of the Castle Trail. The Notch Trail was a test in my fears because there is a tall wooden ladder you climb (and go back down when you're done) and there are some narrow ridges with drop offs. I have a fear of falling but was able to complete it successfully and would definitely go back! The view at the end is beautiful!","July 2, 2018","Great Views, Good Hiking, Excellent Exploring!",55,"Kansas City, Missouri",5

Badlands National Park,"I love all our national parks for all their unique features and the Badlands is no exception. With half a day, you can drive the scenic road and do a few short hikes (Door and Window Trails, perhaps). But I would encourage you to stay overnight to truly experience the magic of the Badlands. We were there for both sunset and sunrise. I think sunrise was my favorite. 5 AM, no one around, the rocks burning a bright orange color in the rising sun....magical! On a clear night, you can also get some amazing stargazing, though it was overcast the night we were there.Whatever you do, make sure to stop in at this park for as long as you can. If you want a longer hike, we did part of the Castle Trail which was very cool, too.","July 2, 2018",Beautiful park; stay overnight if you can,228,"Peoria, Illinois",5
Badlands National Park,"After nine hours of driving we were excited to see the place where we visited 20 years ago! Phenomenal! It was still as beautiful as it was before! It took us 3 1/2 hours to drive through. We stopped at different places for pictures and short walks. We were really surprised to see children of all ages climbing to the tops of hills with no supervision whatsoever! My husband climbed some tall hills and I did one, one slip or trip in some of these areas and you could be in some serious trouble! Some parents didn't seem to understand the danger and were not monitoring their kids at all! This happened at Iron Mountain Road also, very scary and worrisome!

Badlands National Park,"This was our second visit to Badlands National Park. It contains some incredible landscapes created by erosion. The land is arid, however, so make sure you take a bottle of water with you. And, you will unfortunately see some tourists ignoring the signs and climbing all over the delicate natural features in the park. They are dangerous as well as delicate. While we were there, we witnessed someone take a bad fall that required an ambulance evacuation. Beside that, I am not fond of rattlesnakes, and there are bunches in the Badlands.In addition to the unique landscapes, we saw both bison and bighorn sheep while wewere there.The Badlands are nowhere as spectacular as Bryce Canyon's hoo-doos, or the majesty of the Grand Canyon, but they are worth a stop if you're in the area.","July 1, 2018",Great Scenery,86,"New London, NC",4

Badlands National Park,"We have never been to the Badlands in South Dakota, although we have visited the smaller versions in Kansas. Beautiful and strange protrusions from the ground! We hiked the Notch trail early in the morning, before the heat came on. The view at the end of the trail is spectacular towards the south. From the top, we saw a mamma deer with two babies. A large wooden rung ladder is required on the trail, and some paths along the cliff are only 2' wide but our 10 & 13 year olds did just fine. I would not do this trail during or after a rain. We also visited Fossil Exhibit trail, which had ecological info signs along the wooden path. Saddle Pass trail starts with a pretty sharp climb, and we did not go far in the heat. The Cliff Shelf Nature trail was pleasant, in the shade of trees for our early picnic. We viewed deer and bunnies. We also drove to the Prairie Dog area, but found the area just north of the NE entrance more active to watch.","June 30, 2018",Strange and fascinating formations during hiking,66,"Wichita, Kansas",5
Badlands National Park,"This is a beautiful park with excellent hiking trails of varied length. There are several short hiking trails that provide awesome views. Several of the short trails are on boardwalks and are handicapped accessible. My favorite trail was ""Notch Trail"". It is a 1.5 mile loop that includes a steep ladder and walking along a ledge on the side of a ""canyon"". The ""notch"" that the trail is named after provides a panoramic view of the Cliff Shelf area to the south. The visitor center has interesting displays, a film, and fossils that have been found in the park. In addition to the main paved road through the park, there is also the gravel rim road where lots of pronghorn, prairie dogs, buffalo, and big horn sheep can be seen. Entrance fee is $20 for a 7 day pass. There is a campground near the visitor center and also one of the Rim Road that has free primitive sites. The main campground was full when we visited so we stayed at a nearby KOA campground.","June 30, 2018",Beautiful Scenery and Hiking,59,Pawnee,5

There are fossils lime stones sand stones plain green vallies and what not. Animals are seen in natural habitation. Prairie dogs deers bisons foxes big horn sheep are seen. It is a land of geological interest . It is called badlands as it is not suitable for living . places for hiking are available.

Badlands National Park,"This national park is fairly close to the interstate and with the loop road you can travel through the whole park and continue going the direction you were headed in. From the west and/Rapid City you can enter via the Wall, SD exit on the interstate and head east through the loop road. Coming from the east, I believe you take the Interior, SD exit at mile marker 131 and can head west through the park.This is a fee park, and they raised the entrance rates this coming year, currently it is $20, but I used an annual park pass. Fee stations are at both of the major entrances if no one is at the entrance station you are expected to pay at the visitor center according to one ranger. I'm not sure, but usually during the very early hours of the morning and later hours the stations might not be manned. However, during general operating hours, they are manned.Upon entering the park, you will be given a brochure with a basic map of certain locations and the park newspaper.Shortly after entering either entrance, you will come to the overlooks for the badlands. On the western side if you follow the main loop road you will reach the pinnacles overlook and on the eastern side, you will come to the Big Badlands Overlook. The loop road is about 40 miles with multiple overlooks where you can see the park.The visitor's center is closer to the eastern side of the park. Other facilities are located near there as well. Several gravel or dirt roads can provide access to other parts of the park, but they may not be opened.The badlands formations are located on both sides of the road. One of the interesting locations, in my opinion, is the ""Yellow Mounds Overlook."" When visiting here, you should be sure to go to the lower end of the parking lot and look on the opposite side of the road for some more interesting views.Various wildlife can be found in the park. On my first visit years ago only saw prairie dogs; this trip I saw the prairie dogs, but also saw 4 bighorn sheep coming down the side of the road after the second major overlook area, and saw some pronghorns. When I went back the next morning trying to see the rising sun's impact, the pronghorn were plentiful near the Pinnacles overlook, as well as several bison very close to the entrance station on the west side of the park.One area younger individuals might like is the fossil trail, a very easy and level boardwalk.Several things to be aware of include the fact that it can get quite hot in the badlands and that you can actually hike throughout the terrain. It is important that you keep track of where you are going so you can find your way back. Also, many people climb up the various rocks, but they may or not be really stable for climbing, so take precautions. As usual, one should be careful about the wildlife. Rattlesnakes are a potential hazard while hiking, Also, the pronghorn, bison, and bighorn sheep could be dangerous if you get too close. While driving, the road has a lot of curves and a few blind spots, so it is important to focus more on the driving than on the scenery.Overall, I enjoyed this park very much.","June 26, 2018",Interesting National Park,80,"Salisbury, North Carolina",5

We spent an entire day driving the loop road, taking a couple short hikes and stopping at overlooks for photos. Really enjoyed it. We spent the second day on the Pine Ridge Reservation. In the evenings we went to ranger talks and also did some stargazing.The ranger talks are excellent, not just informative but entertaining. Don't miss the evening shows at the amphitheater. Rangers go in-depth on different topics and answer any questions you might have. They also sometimes do an astronomy program after the regular evening presentation.Bring sturdy shoes, rain gear, sunscreen and a hat -- no matter what you are planning to do.

I pulled up and asked if they took cards and it was an abrupt answer that made me feel like I was inconveniencing her. I shouldnt be made to feel like a brother when I'm paying money to enter the park. I thought $20 per car entry fee was a bit steep, but as soon as we got into the park, the landscaping took my breath away. It really is just incredible! Photos and videos could never do it justice! My husband and I stopped by on our way back home from our trip to Rushmore. We wish we would have stopped on the way there when the weather was sunny and gorgeous. However, despite the rain and gloomy weather, we loved stopping at the viewpoints to take photos.What we thought would be a quick drive turned into a 2 hour excursion and we didn't even cover 1/4 of the loop since we were pressed for time. This place is an absolute must see! I've never seen anything like it. We are definitely going to return when the weather is more desirable one day. Different viewpoints had restrooms one location which was much appreciated. Because of the rain we didn't venture on to any of the trails, but I'm sure they would be exciting when the weather is right!Tip: Set aside a couple hours at minimum.

Badlands National Park,"I'd seen the Badlands what felt like about a million times in wanderlust Instagram posts, but it didn't fully prepare me for how it'd affect me in person. As we drove in the direction of the park, the landscape was all grasslands and it seemed that even though road signs said we were nearing it, we wouldn't. Then it sneaks up on you all of a sudden. It looks unreal, like something on an alien planet from Star Wars. I went to many national parks on that vacation and this was by far my favorite. There are ample opportunities to park and look out onto the vast landscape. Take advantage! I visited in July when it was close to 100 degrees, BUT it was manageable to walk around a bit (at least for an East Coaster who's used to stifling July humidity like me) because there was next to no humidity. During our stay we saw some mountain goats perched on top of lofty rock formations that seemed impossible to climb, even if ""mountain"" is part of your name. We also saw several prairie dogs, which was something we'd been hoping to see during our visit. Just park on the side of the ride near where you see signs for them and be a little patient.

We left at around 6 and felt like we’d had a good, full visit. We took the Sage Creek Rim Road to 44 to head back to Rapid City. It’s a gravel road but worth it for the vistas and the wildlife.

There are opportunities to see pronghorn, bighorn sheep, buffalo, prairie dogs and many species of birds. Interactive exhibits and trails allow you to learn more about the animals and plants that occupied that space long before we visited.

We stopped at the Ben Reifel Visitor Center which is very informative. Ask to see the movie and take the time to see the exhibits which are very well done. The park itself is just unreal. The beauty of it cannot be believed. There are many places to hike, short and long and the park rangers can give you the hiking guide. Many lookouts to pull into and take the time to stop at all of them. Different views at each one.

We saw lots of wild life - a herd of big horn sheep, lots of prairie dogs, buffalo, antelope, while tail deer, mule deer and an eagle. Make sure your dog is on a leash. We saw someone get a ticket from the ranger because his dog was running loose on the hiking trail. It was cloudy the first day there and the pictures are AMAZING!

Badlands National Park,The Bad Lands are one of the most fascinating creations of nature I have ever seen! This is a geological wonder that is a must see especially for children as they will marvel at the huge spires and gouged out canyons that spread for miles across the landscape. Careful though as the canyons are truly steep and dangerous. Anyone familiar with geologic formations carved by wind and rain will attest to the dynamic effects of nature on open rock. At every turn in the road new sights are seen that are simply breath taking. At one stop prairie dogs were seen actively popping up from their burrows. Really a fascinating place to visit.,"April 24, 2018",A True Natural Wonder!,30,"Walnut, Illinois",5

Let me tell you, something about watching a lightning storm come across the Badlands is something everyone should see. We enjoyed climbing and hiking around and watching the goats. Then the rain hit. And it hit hard. I have never been in a storm like that and was glad that we were safely in the car. It was very interesting driving through the park in the rain, but it was beautiful. One of the most unique places on earth, in my opinion. I hope to return someday.","April 9, 2018","Great time, such a unique place",67,Wisconsin,5

Sun was reflecting on high peaks glimmering from water's run-offs, I could not turn my head fast enough to take in all those awe inspiring sites. Don't miss it if you are around, don't miss it if you have time and like to travel. Late in evening and early in morning you can see wild animals roaming around in the fields or high on, what you would consider, impossible to reach peaks.

Badlands National Park,"This National Park, like America's other national parks, is a Wonderland of unique creation like no other. Pictures don't do it justice. You must visit it yourself to experience the grandeur of the landscape, the physical formations and the color of this park. We rolled in from the northeast entrance during a Thursday afternoon in August. Several of the parking lots by some of the popular trails (Door Trail and Window Trail) were busy with park goers, but there was always a parking space available. Incidentally, these 2 trails give you an introduction of what the park has to offer. If you want to break away from the crowd though, you need only to go down the road a little way and hike the Notch Trail. This is what we did. The trail immerses you into the Badlands and gives you that feeling of isolation from the rest of the world. Yet, you will run into other hikers along the trail. At the end of the trail is the ""notch"" that allows you to have a panoramic view of the valley below. The Ben Reifel Visitor Center is just loaded with all the information you need to set out on the trails and to navigate your visit through the park.Unfortunately for us, our travel plans allowed for a very limited amount of time in Badlands, but we enjoyed the park immensely during the 4 hours that we were there. And that was just the small section of the eastern end of the park. Someday we'll plan to spend much more time there so we can do the full Badlands Loop Road. Even if you just have a few hours to spend at the park, it is still well worth the effort to get there.There is a fee of $20.00 per vehicle for a 7 day pass, unless you have an interagency annual, senior, access or military pass or a Badlands Annual Pass, in which case the fee is waived.","October 25, 2017",Badlands...AWESOME!,117,"Fargo, North Dakota",5
Badlands National Park,The Badlands driving Loop is amazing. It is a total of 31 miles and takes about an hour with a few stops and short walks to get up close and personal. Lots of photo ops and amazing views. A little added perk to the drive is that you get to see lots of Prairie Dogs popping in and out of their holes. While we were watching the Prairie Dogs a wolf came stalking in looking for prey. We also saw some mountain sheep at the beginning of the drive.

Badlands National Park,"So, while you are there - visit the Visitor Center. You can find out about some history. Also, if you have interest in doing any of the hikes, they have a nice trail map for you. They can also answer questions you may have about the hike. I did the 10 mile hike (5 miles each way). It was 10 miles long but very very little elevation change (if any) so it's a very flat 10 miles. It was also very hot the day I did this but only 14% humidity so it truly was a dry heat. You will need to make sure to pack in plenty of water. I would highly stress the important of a wide brimmed hat since there is little/no shade available. Taking the hike was great to see another side of the park. A peaceful side to it. Saw some bison and rams while out and about. You can see a ton of features on the drive for sure but the hike just allows you get up close and enjoy the park.

Since we visited after the summer rush there was not much of a crowd. The park reminded us of Painted Dessert in Arizona. The drive through the park was very scenic with the added benefit of seeing a prairie dog town with quite a few residents. The restaurant at the gift shop was better than expected.

Badlands National Park,National Park visits are becoming pricey. You just have to consider how satisfying it will be to see something rare and hope that it is being preserved. Badlands is certainly different than what most people see at home. The subtlety of the color on the naturally carved stone changes with the light. A cloudy day will detract from the experience.

We used our National Park Pass again (you must purchase this Pass) as we entered the Park area. What amazes me is how the terrain can change in just a matter of miles/minutes from the flat area of I-90 to this incredible scenery of such unusual landscape. As everyone does, we drove the entire length of highway 240 south of I-90 which took us several hours of driving, pit stops at restaurants/souvenir shops, taking pictures from lookouts and getting out of the car to walk amongst the mountains where possible. There is so much to do and see in western South Dakota and you must check the box on this Bucket List item. I will mention we left heading west from Sioux Falls, SD at approximately 0900 and with the stop at the Minuteman Missile attraction plus the Badlands tour, we arrived in Rapid City at 6 o'clock PM.

I've been to loads of national parks and none have a Big horn Sheep population that can be seen here. Also, the landscapes are very interesting. Sure some of the other parks have more dramatic landscapes, but Badlands is still quite remarkable. Try to visit after it rains, so that you can see the best display of color in the formations. Several park rangers here told me that the best time to see the color here is in the spring after some rain. Apparently they get most of their rain in the Spring.

They do make you think you have landed on the moon or something. It's no wonder they served as such a barrier to the early settlers, I cannot imagine how difficult it was to take wagons apart, get them up the cliffs, and then reassemble them on the top. It is a very hot place to visit, so take a hat and plenty of water. The ride through the park offers plenty of places to get off the road and do a little hiking or just to get a better look at the surroundings.

Badlands National Park,"I spent 2 days in the park (yes, a little less, but I was pressed for time). Now, for the actual plan for the park, I kind of did a mix of driving and a little hiking. Enter the park from highway 240 (NorthEast Entrance)Sunrise: Start with Big Badlands Overlook point. You will not be disappointed. That area of the park gets the first rays of the sun, and you can see the colors totally changing in 15-20 minutes. Once you've enjoyed the sunrise, drive a little further up the road, you will see signs for Window/Door/Notch Trails. Notch does involve some climbing and slippery surfaces, but nothing too difficult. The landscapes are wonderful. Door trail is super easy and level and close to sun rise time you will get beautiful pictures. Notch - climb up to see the expanse of the prairies. I did the medicine root trail, but it is totally optional for you guys (I like hiking). You can then do the scenic route through the park once you stop at Ben Reiffel Visitor's Center. The overlook points are well marked and every stop has a great view. Drive slowly, take your time and enjoy. One thing to note though....During mid-day the colors will look washed from the harsh sunlight...So plan your day accordingly. Pinnacles Overlook is the place to enjoy sunset. And of course, stay till it gets totally dark, you will be able to see the milky way on a clear night !!!","September 25, 2017",Beautiful park,80,"Chicago, Illinois",5

Choose your entry point based on the position of the sun at the time of day you are going. The colors of the terrain are more distinctive early in the morning or late in the afternoon with the sun shining on them.

The entrance fee is now $20 for a private vehicle, but you can purchase the National Parks passes and there are reduce rates for seniors and those with permanent disabilities.

There are also visitor centers that are worth the stop that explain the history and geology of the region. (It used to be part of an ocean!) In the visitor center there is a small gift shop that has much information about the park, history of the area and souvenirs. There is also a museum with fossils and dioramas.Along with the majestic scenery we saw on the drive, we also saw thousands of prairie dogs in different colonies, a few bison and bighorn sheep grazing right along the roadway!

Badlands National Park,"We spent a day at Badlands, stopping at the Ben Reifel Visitor Center, driving the Loop Road, doing some short hikes at Window and Door, the Cliff Shelf, and the Fossil trail, and stopping for photo opportunites at several scenic overlooks - and while they were all very, very good, by far the most spectacular was Pinnacles. If you can, time your visit to early morning (I revisited the next morning for sunrise at Pinnacles, which was incredible) or sunset. We also returned for a stargazing program at the Cedar Pass Amphitheatre, which was great fun for everyone. We timed it to be there for the Perseid Meteor Shower, and seeing the Milky Way and several tremendous meteors was just icing on the cake.Wonderful park rangers (my daughter LOVED the junior ranger program), incredible scenery that feels like something from a different planet, and a great night program - this was really the greatest time we've had at any national park so far (and we've visited several).Be prepared: sunscreen, a hat, sunglasses, and plenty of water are ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS for visiting in the summertime. Although the temp reported was mid-80s when we visited, it felt closer to 100 when we were hiking among the rocks. Hiking boots are also STRONGLY recommended - we saw several people walking around in flip-flops or sandals, and I'm sure they regretted their footwear choice by the end of theday!","August 16, 2017",WOW!

It is not large but you can drive slow and stop and read all the highlights. Personally, I loved the animals to photograph. There were many wild bighorn sheep which were NOT wild.

The rocks here were deposited around 50-30ish million year ago in environments ranging from tropical forest and dry grass lands.

You will see how the terrain really varies if you take the time to do this, including walking out and looking back on some of the extended walk ways.

I saw families enjoying picnic lunches - a great idea.I missed maybe 2 or 3 viewpoints at the end of the road and going onto the reservation as I needed to continue my travels.Nature's beauty is amazing.

We were treated to the site of Big Horn Sheep and Buffalo as we traversed the Badlands, and the kids were enthralled with the Prairie Dogs.

We took the 20+ mile drive and stopped at the many scenic overlooks. We did see a prairie dog and 3 animals that looked like either goats with long horns or some kind of deer. I can't imagine being there, traveling west, 100 years ago and coming upon this place, where you didn't see many trees and wouldn't be able to farm the land. Guess that's where the name came from - bad land. Glad we were able to go.

We saw hundreds of wild buffalo and drove right through the herd. It was truly unforgettable. At every overlook we stopped and still continued to be amazed by the views. Aside from the buffalo, we loved the prairie dogs. We also saw an elk out in the field and a mountain goat sunning on a rock formation.

The kids and my husband (and, yes, I admit, myself) really enjoyed the views, the hikes, the climbing and playing, the prairie dogs, the mountain goats - never a dull moment.

Many overlooks to stop at and actually walk out to view the sights and see the wildlife. Some of the boardwalks seemed a bit slippery at times. Just don't run like a maniac and you'll be perfectly fine. Do watch your kids as the rocks crumble and are unstable at points near the edge.

In early July the park was not very busy and we were able to take our time on the road and lookouts. The scenery is fascinating with a wide variety of formations and colors. There is an interesting mix of open grasslands, wide vistas, canyons and the remarkable badlands. The colors of the hills seem to change with every turn of the road and the bighorn sheep were out in numbers for all to enjoy. The big skies of the Dakotas have a real impact. Often in other parks the view is obscured by high mountains or large trees, however, you can still see from horizon to horizon in this park. You truly get a sense of wide open spaces!

It took us about an 1.5 hours but we were there off season and not a lot of traffic. There are some buffalo but we didn't see a lot of them, just the scenery and topography was incredible.

The park is beautiful and the hills change color everywhere you look. Prairie Dogs are everywhere. All you have to do is look for their white sand mounds and listen for them barking. We also saw big horn sheep. This park is beautiful and not to be missed when in the area. It takes roughly two hours to see the park.

Badlands National Park,"While we were passing through the state of South Dakota, we stumbled upon the Badlands National Park. Although the sun was setting we entered into the park and found the very scary road to the campsite which was about 25 miles in the dark in our large Sunseeker RV. After finding a spot we settled in for the night and returned to the ranger station in the morning to pay our fees. The campsites were very basic but had electrical hook ups and were very flat. Most of the sites were a pull through off the side of the campground Road. Because we were there in April, we enjoyed that it wasn't the tourist season yet and the campsites were very empty. We took our Prius off of that EZE tow dolly and were able to set out to explore more of the park. There are many obvious hiking trails created by the park, however there are places to explore that could be quite dangerous off the trail. There are steep cliffs, erosion and mud caves created by the wind weather and rain. If you want to explore more of the mud caves you should take a knowledgeable guide. The wildlife was quite stunning as we saw bison, antelope, dear, snakes and prairie dogs. Of course, you should never approach wildlife and the prairie dogs in the Badlands National Park have plague, so as fun as it seems to get close, you should keep your distance. The visitor center is very educational and actually has a spot for you to leave a postcard or piece of mail. There are many exhibits and signs that explore the geology of this area. It is against the law to take any shells, rocks or vegetation with you. The flanking town of Wall is very small, however you must take a trip to Wall Drugs, trust me you'll see the signs. We were able to explore Wall Drugs for several hours but I wish we could have spent more time there. It's a wonderful example of a good old fashion Americana with STorrs, eateries and very authentic and local craft. You could easily explore and hike the Badlands for two or three days.","May 24, 2017",A Mysterious Adventure with our RV,1,,5

Badlands National Park,"This spectacular National Park provides a view of wild prairie grassland and incredible geology rock formations, pinnacles and eroded buttes. We visited late afternoon and early evening. At that time the sun was low in the sky and provided wonderful shadows highlighting the rock formations. I reckon that best times to visit are either early morning or late afternoon. When we were driving through the Badlands, there were hardly any other visitors. Wonderful and wild!Our tour took us on a loop from Rapid City taking state 44 through the the grasslands (viewing the Badlands pinnacles in the distance) to Interior, then through the Northern part of Badlands National Park along the state 240 loop road to Wall where we returned to Rapid City via the Interstate 90. A distance of about 175 miles.The loop road provides a good route to see the various formations, winding amongst the buttes and across the high prairie grassland. There are numerous stopping points along the route for photographic opportunities and to walk away from the road. Some of the stops also have overviews across the lower prairies and the White River valley.At one stop there is a ""fossil trail"" - a short boardwalk with information boards illustrating various fossils found in the formation and indicating whether the type of animal became extinct, moved on or adapted.The drive along the loop road takes at least an hour.

However, we saw more animals in half an hour driving through than we did in almost our entire 1600 mile road trip (winter/early spring). The views and the rock colours are pretty spectacular. The visitors center was one of the best we saw in 5 major parks, and I wish I had had time and money to browse the gift shop - way more books and other items that I hadn't seen in the other parks.You can really get a sense of how open, unprotected, and quiet it must have been for early settlers. I kept thinking of Little House on the Prairie!

Badlands National Park,"Badlands national park is filled with scenery like no other. We entered through the pinnacles entrance past the town of Wall and took the highway 240 loop through the entire park. There are tons of lookout areas to stop, take pictures, or explore. I recommend wearing hiking shoes and exploring some of the off beaten path past the lookouts. Big horn sheep are prevalent and will not hesitate to approach your parked vehicle. We arrived in the early afternoon and drove to most all of the lookouts, then caught a beautiful sunset. We came back that evening after it was completely dark to view the stars. It is absolutely incredible, and quite scary to be in pure darkness and silence and view thousands upon thousands of stars. The following day we returned and hiked the saddle pass, castle, and medicine root trail which was about 4 miles over all. To get the best experience at the badlands, catch a sunrise or sunset, and wear boots that you are able to get a little off course with. There is a $20 entrance fee to the park that is paid at the visitors center. Totally worth it!

Badlands National Park,"I have waited forever to see the Badlands and they did not disappoint. What an awesome experience! It truly was a ""Window to the West"". What an unforgettable view. We took the Badlands Loop Road - Highway 240. We came in from the Northeast Gateway Entrance at Catus Flat and took the 40 mile drive through the Badlands. Our first stop was the Big Badlands Overlook. Here we saw a herd of Bighorn Sheep down in one of the valleys. They just kept on eating. We were amazed that we even got to see some! The park is a maze of canyons, buttes,pinnacles and spires. Our stops included Yellow Mounds, Pinnacles, Door Trail, Cliff Shelf Trail, Window Trail, doors and Windows Parking area and Fossil Exhibit Trail. There is so much to see and do here. You will be driving down the road and they just sneak up on you! Our pictures will never do the Badlands justice. We were there late afternoon into early evening. Because we were there off season - the park visitor's center was already closed for the day so we didn't get to have our Park Passport Book Stamped. You can look for miles and miles! It is very scenic. This land is our land - this land is your land! My daughter said this is stuff she sees on Twitter and now here we are!!! Every turn is such an adventure. You can hike on the many trails and go right into the Badlands themselves. They have some paths but many wooden walkways because of the rattlesnakes and so you don't damage the park. As we were driving through, right along the road was a female (ewe) Bighorn just eating the grass. We watched her for several minutes - she just ignored us and kept right on eating. We were able to take many, many pictures of her. We also saw prairie dogs, cottontails, 2 dead bull snakes, mule deer and buffalo on the way through.The Buffalo Gap National Grasslands encompasses the Badlands National Park. We did get to stop at Cedar Pass Lodge Gift Shop for postcards and local souvenirs - This was another great day on our trip across the country and YES I would go back in a heartbeat.","March 17, 2017",Badlands National Park,54,"Johnstown, Pennsylvania",5

Badlands National Park,"The full-time traveler's life offers a rare joy. Time. There are few demands on how we use our time, at least few other than those self-inflicted. This week in Badlands National Park is a great example. We've been to the Badlands a few times during our lives. The most memorable, nearly 40 years ago, was a drive over the loop road at dawn. But those few visits have been short detours as we focused on our longer-term goal of driving from Point A to Point B. The past week has been our first immersive tenure in the Badlands. We took time to take short hikes, slowly cruise gravel roads, tour local attractions, visit with cordial strangers. We shot piles of photos at all times of the day, as the September sun drew the pencil sharp edges of spires and gullies, as long autumn shadows slowly rotated from west to east, as the intensity of pastel colors in rock strata waned and waxed. Late afternoon shine off of golden prairie grasses clearly demarcated the flat tables amidst the ruins of erosion. For six days, we simply watched the landscape evolve and revolve during its daily routine.We took time to watch a bison bull massage its massive aging flanks on well worn posts. We resisted the temptation to ignore the common prairie dog, and watched their hyperactive hijinks within their sprawling towns, darting in and out of their burrows in the blink of the eye. We caught a glimpse of a swift fox rocket out of a bluff above the White River. We watched tourists dart into overlooks, snap a few photos, dart back out, and disappear into the distance.

The visitor center has a great gift shop for some souvenirs. If you have time, drive out towards Sage Creek road ( I think that's what it was called) - it was a dirt road, but it paid off when we got to see a bunch of bison up close and personal.

Badlands National Park,We did not have the best weather when we visited. It was overcast and the visibility was not very good but it still was a wonderful experience. The landscape is amazing. The fossil displays are so very interesting. We thought that we would quickly drive the loop trail but found that we had to stop at every overlook and experience the unusual landscape. We have visited seven national parks on this trip and every one is so different.,"September 24, 2016",Another wonderful National Park,207,"Sarasota, Florida",5

Maybe 4 other people there. Felt almost eerie how desolate the landscape is. We saw bighorn sheep while driving in and stopped a few times for pictures and just to soak up the stark beauty.

Badlands National Park,"This should be added to most peoples bucket list. It took us a full day to roam and view the approximate 75 miles of the park. Every few miles there are new views, new colors, new formations, new animals to stop and watch and take a few pictures of. Just a few miles later there are new colors and shapes of melting mountains and rolling prairie and grasslands disappearing into the horizons. From here we went to do Yellowstone but I would have preferred to repeat our ride around the Badlands because we saw more varieties and even headcount of animals. There were crows, bald eagles, hawks, buzzards, coyotes, what appeared to be a pack of wolves on a hunt, mule deer, bison, prairie dogs, mountain goats, antelope scattered through out the park's constantly changing landscape.Pictures worth a million words.","September 14, 2016","Colorfull, awe-inspiring, natures eye candy",90,Dallas TX,5
Badlands National Park,"This national park should fit into your schedule - you can spend as little or as much time as you want and still really enjoy it. My son and i enjoyed some of the shorter trails because we had limited time, but there are much longer ones. However, you can skip all trails and drive through. The visitor center offered a free theatre style documentary and has a small museum. Toilets are great and can accommodate bus loads. Nice gift shop as well. It was cloudy and cool with a an occasional slight drizzle, but the weather did not take away from the majestic rock formations. Very well worth the entrance fee.","September 14, 2016",Stunning views - well maintained trails - Awesome,44,"Laclede, Missouri",5

It took us almost 3 hrs, stopping at every lookout to take in the beautiful views. The next day we did some hiking. Be sure to bring a lot of water as some of the longer trails are without shade in the afternoon. The notch trail was a bit strenuous with some ladder climbing but worth every minute of it.

Badlands National Park,"We loved our time in the Badlands! Although only 2 hours from the Black Hills, we stayed at a campground nearby and we were so happy to have a full day to explore the park. We started out early in the morning before the heat of the sun. We stopped by the Ben Reifel visitor's center and found out about a Ranger-led program at the Door Trail. What a treat! We discovered the history of the area as well as what was allowed in the park... you can hike and climb just about anywhere! We were happy to be traveling with our kids as teens - I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much having to chase little ones around - there are many places that are fun to explore, and many places to get hurt if you aren't careful. We spent about an hour exploring the Door Trail and then went to the Notch Trail which was a little more climbing to get to spectacular views. Be sure to wear comfortable hiking shoes! After our hiking we drove out along the Badlands Loop Road where we saw our first Bison and many prairie dogs. We finished our day going to the famous Wall Drug. We were back to our campground by 7pm - since the sun doesn't set until 10pm in July, we had plenty of time before dark. Although the night programs sounded fabulous, I couldn't keep my eyes open after 10pm to see the stars! ","September 12, 2016",Amazing geologic wonder,5,"Boston, Massachusetts",5

We drove through but many opportunities for more agile or adventuresome hikers. The visitor center was excellent. In our direction we saw last but may have appreciated park even more if saw first. Explanations of geology, wildlife and archeological demonstrations were fascinating. Restaurant next door was perfect for lunch, recommend the Indian Tacos. Geology, colors, views, serenity, remoteness of the park was captivating. Big Horn Sheep resting comfortably just off the road. Happened to rain during our drive but didn't bother us at all.

The loop that starts in Wall and ends by the Cold War national monument was just the ticket. The buffalo were elsewhere in the park, but we unexpectedly saw a big horn sheep full curl ram eating grass next to the road. It was just a delight. I'd never seen the park so early in the morning before--it was just so lovely.

There is a loop, Rt 240, but you can also take a side loop which you can see part of Indian reservations I was told. We stayed on the main loop. Many viewing spots with great scenery. Look for the Big Horned Sheep and take unsalted peanuts for the prairie dogs. There is a Prairie dog place before going in that we stopped at and bought nuts there.

We had US National Park passes so entry was free for our car of 4 people. The mountains are very hard to describe - each set is different than the one before. They look liked inverted caverns.

I didn't know much about it before we reached SD, but had I know I would have definitely put it on my bucket list!!! For those of you who have been to Sedona, I can kind of compare it to that.

The vistas from the overlooks were spectacular. We also took a couple of short hikes (bring water!) and stopped at the visitor center. Definitely drive thru at minimum, and if you have the time and inclination, get out for at least one short walk. Truly a special place in America.","August 7, 2016",Unique Terrain,46,Wisconsin,5

Badlands National Park,"The Badlands are definitely worth a trip while in South Dakota. There are a few ways to get to it - either via route 90 or route 44. We went the latter route. We went first to the Ben Reifel Visitor's Center, which is right after the entrance. They have a very informative video there about the park. There is a nice loop road through the park that takes you to many amazing sights. Make sure to go to the Door and Window trails, just north of the Visitor's Center. There is an amazing canyon there. It can get very hot there (well over 100 in mid-July) so make sure you have a lot of water. The views are just amazing. Especially all the colors you can see in the rocks. You may even see some prairie dogs, but just don't go near them. They have the plague.","July 31, 2016",Worth a trip,12,"Carlisle, Pennsylvania",5

Badlands National Park,"If you have taken in a few of the Canyons in the US, you will be used to the views, but what makes Badlands special is the colors available. Now the park has a lower part that you can come in from Hermosa and the one listed here in the interior. Both of these can be done in a 3-4 hour stretch. You can get off take a bunch of pics and get everything in. I would highly recommend this as a second day trip after knocking off Crazy Horse and Mount Rushmore.","July 28, 2016",Worth a look,67,"Altus, Oklahoma",5
Badlands National Park,"Should you visit Badlands National Park? Absolutely! But, let's begin by comparing Badlands NP to other major National Parks:- Badland's tallest features are a few hundred feet above the floor. Dozens of other parks have more impressive geography. Think Grand Canyon, Zion, and Yosemite.- Badland's claim to desolation doesn't really compare to Death Valley, Glacier, and other large NP's. I doubt any prepared explorer could get seriously lost in the Badlands, even in it's remote reaches.- Badlands does have significant fossil beds if that's of interest to you. - Wildlife is visible in the mornings and evenings. Prairie dogs are particularly abundant and active. You may also see Bighorn and Pronghorn sheep, an occasional rabbit or rattlesnake, but that's about all.- Badlands NP s near the Black Hills, Wind Cave, Mt. Rushmore, Deadwood, and many other points of interest, so it can (and should) be included in a tour of the region. Other parks can be quite remote.So, if you decided to go, here's a few suggestions:- The park is very accessible from the main road (like most National Parks). If you have just an hour or two, bypass the interstate and drive through stopping at the pullouts.- Most of the highlights are within a short hike of the main road. Some hikes are flat and some have elevation change. Plan ahead or stop at the visitor center for maps.- You can hike almost every trail in one (long) day. So a single day is sufficient to enjoy most of the Badlands. - The visitor centers have helpful rangers and simple museums.- Sunrise and Sunset are the most scenic time to visit. Keep in mind that sunrise is very early and sunset very late this far north. - Wildlife is most active early and late. But prairie dogs are active all day and can be found at several locations along the paved road through the park.- At the east entrance, check out the Minuteman Missile NHS and at the West Entrance, Wall Drug. - If you're really adventurous, drive the gravel roads further into the park and check out the remote White River Unit. Hike for days if that's your thing!- Camping at Cedar Pass Campground is inexpensive, convenient, spacious and inside the park boundaries. See separate reviews of the campground.","July 27, 2016",How to Enjoy Badlands National Park,472,"Lexington, Kentucky",4

Badlands National Park,"Stayed three nights in the park and used every bit of that time to explore. I love the mix of grasslands and rock formations. A lot of diversity in scenery and wildlife sightings. Saw bison, pronghorn, bighorn, prairie dogs, ground squirrels, etc. lots of different birds as well. I recommend doing the loop road and stopping at every overlook. Many of the ""hikes"" are very short short and some are on boardwalks. For the adventurous look into Notch Trail and do not forget to do the prairie trail. Kids were all over climbing the gentler formations near the roads. A giant natural playground. Nearby are three sites devoted to the minute man missiles. Go early to the visitor center if you want to score tickets to the guided tour of the underground launch control room. Love this park!","July 27, 2016",Beautiful,67,"Raleigh, North Carolina",5
Badlands National Park,"This is something you must experience - massive, amazing, unique. Door, Window, Fossil trails are easy and accessible to everyone - even in sweltering temperatures. The Notch Trail is tough - especially in the heat and with any fear of heights - but worth it even if you only get past the ladder! Wherever you go - look for fossils - they are everywhere! Take the time to drive the loop road at dusk - especially heading out towards Cedar Pass Campground - lots of wildlife (big horn sheep, bison, coyotes, prairie dogs, burrowing owls, etc) The Visitors Center is one of the most interesting and extensive in the NP system - the lab alone is worth an hour. We were not impressed by the Ranger Programs at this site (other NPs have had amazing Ranger Programs) but the rangers in the Visitor's Center were great.","July 27, 2016","Spectacular, like nothing else",37,philadelphia,5
Badlands National Park,"We took the scenic loop. Plan for at least 3-4 hours so you can get out and at the look outs and actually see the badlands. Of course the most fun was when we could get out and climb around on certain areas. The mistake we made was to go into the loop without eating. There is no where between Wall on the West end of the loop and the visitor center on the East of the loop to eat. Either plan to eat early or late, or bring food along. We rushed through the end of the loop because we were too hungry.","July 26, 2016",Amazing to see back in time millions of years,5,"Melbourne, Florida",5

I'm sure if you had more time and more adventurous people with you, some of the trails would be great. But, it's all in direct sunlight (and heat). I read that the best times to see the park are at sunrise and sunset. I can definitely see this, but with sunrise being so early and sunset so late in the summer (plus our drive to/from the hotel), this was not an option for us.

We were driving from Wisconsin and planning on stopping at Mount Rushmore that evening. After a pretty boring drive day (lots of windmills), we saw signs for the Badlands drive thru road. We stopped at a gift shop and found out that the road to through the Badlands would only add about 10 miles to our journey. I'm so glad we decided to do it. The hills and valleys were amazing. We had fun climbing on the rocks and taking lots of photos. I wish we had more time to do some hiking but it is worth driving through even if you don't have the time to hike. My advice is to make sure you stay on the trails. We didn't see any animals but we did hear a few rattlesnakes in the brush! The road through the park ended at Wall Drug.

It may look like just rock formations to some people, but considering how long they have been there and the fact that they actually change a little in appearance every time it rains is kind of high on the ""wow"" factor.Besides taking amazing pictures of the area, a must do is stopping at Prairie Dog Town to feed these super cute critters. Buy a bag of unsalted peanuts for a $1 and you will have furry friends scurrying up to you. The park is open 24 hours and when the store is closed where the prairie dogs are located, they have a bin that is filled with premade bags of peanuts. Do yourself a favor and part with a $1 or 2.

With 4 kids, there were only a couple of places we pulled over that I didn't have the fear that they'd plunge to their deaths! The mounds are somewhat ""soft"" and the ground shifts quite easily under your feet so it's easy to slip.

Badlands National Park,"After driving west for hours on I-90 and seeing the vast open range of land in SD, we were amazed at the stark contrast of the Badlands Loop. The land formations are so very unusual compared to the rest of South Dakota. While we very much enjoyed the Loop drive, we found it to be so repetitive with all the landscapes looking similar. It was well worth the time, glad we saw it, but would only do so if traveling through the area.","June 26, 2016",Stark contrast to the rest of South Dakota,221,"Cincinnati, Ohio",4
Badlands National Park,"In the middle of the South Dakota prairie, your first sight will look like white scallops and spires. Hot but not humid. For people with handicaps who cannot walk trails, there are turnouts where you can view from the vehicle. If you walk a trail, be sure and carry water. It will run off energy in kids for sure","June 23, 2016",Out of this world,11,,5
Badlands National Park,Not an all day attraction unless you plan to hike while there. It is lovely and the loop is easy to travel. We saw prairie dogs and a goat. ,"June 22, 2016",Nice place to see,24,"Eland, Wisconsin",4
Badlands National Park,"The $15 entry fee for this national park is worth every cent. The roads are well maintained and marked, with plenty of well-placed scenic overlooks for pictures and taking in the scope of the land formations and vistas. It was a hot day, but the visitor center gave a us a brief respite to cool down and refill our water bottles with cold, filtered water. It's fun, scenic and doable to get off the boardwalk at the Door Trail...the marker poles keep you on track. The ground is uneven and smooth, so wear good walking shoes...no place for flip-flops; would be hard if you had balance or mobility issues or needed to carry a child, but not strenuous. We also enjoyed the Cliff Shelf trail...you do need to climb a lot of stairs to do the whole thing, but get to walk through some shaded areas and the view and aroma of juniper makes it very worthwhile. The Fossil Exhibit trail was ok...short boardwalk with displays. Be sure to wear lots of sunscreen and keep drinking water! Seriously! The heat and sun can really sneak up on you here, with the low humidity and winds. Allow time for the curvy, hilly and crowded loop drive (including RVs). One highlight was watching a mama pronghorn and her baby emerge from a canyon and cross slowly to a prairie. ","June 22, 2016",Scenic vistas and walks,14,"La Crosse, Wisconsin",4
Badlands National Park,"I had a blast at Badlands National Park. We camped in a tent and heard coyotes at night. Showers were cheap and very long. There is a great restaurant by the visitor center for breakfast. Also, the gift shop is very nice. The hiking trails were amazing and easy to follow. We saw big horn sheep. The sunsets were amazing. Great for photos.","June 22, 2016",Great Park,130,Indiana,5

Badlands National Park,"We were so surprised at how incredibly gorgeous the Badlands are. We had seen pictures, but seeing it in person was really indescribable. We spent the entire day there and could have easily spent more time there. There were many trails and overlooks throughout the park and there were breathtaking vistas everywhere we turned. Just an amazing area! ","June 20, 2016",Would Give It 6 Stars If I Could!,53,"Columbus, Ohio",5
Badlands National Park,"After seeing the Rockies, the Continental Divide, Yellowstone, Shoshone, Custer State Park and the Needles Highway, I was somewhat prepared for the Badlands to be a let down. Wrong, wrong, wrong!! It was incredible! Absolutely beautiful scenery, lots of wildlife. Loved seeing the prairie dogs, popping their little heads out of their prarie dog holes, scampering about and tittering. We also saw a huge herd of bison, but not up close like in Yellowstone. It's hot, it's dusty..but it is beautiful.","June 20, 2016",Beautiful Scenery!,204,"New York City, New York",5
Badlands National Park,"It is called Badland, but should be called beautiful land.

Colors are even more pronounced after rain.","June 20, 2016",Only nature can create something so amazing.,125,"Chicago, Illinois",5

Badlands National Park,"The park is beautiful. Unless you plan extensive hiking, it is easily seen in one day. You can easily drive the scenic loop, take in the movie and exhibits at the visitor center, stop at all the scenic overlooks, and do several short hikes easily in a day. There are 9 pm ranger talks in summer at the campground. Rangers at the visitor center answered our questions and were very helpful. Signs at every trailhead warn that this beautiful area is also home to prairie rattlesnakes. We did not see any in our day and a half in the park. Several short boardwalks are positioned at some of the overlooks. Trails are marked with vertical posts, as you walk over the Badland formations. We saw mountain sheep at the Pinnacles overlook and on the first overlook on the gravel road to Robert's Prairie Dog Town. Bison were also near the prairie dog town. The yellow mounds were spectacular and the colors of the formations themselves change throughout the park and the time of day.","June 16, 2016",Unexpectedly Beautiful,112,Chesterfield,5
Badlands National Park,We did the loop and stopped several times at beautiful vistas. At the most northern vista which is the most beautiful we saw a dozen big horn sheep on the cliffs. and further down we saw some about 15 feet away. It is great to use our Senior Pass to get into all national parks free. We Went to Wall Drug and ate before the drive. We are looking forward to more federal parks tomorrow. We live in a beautiful country!!,"June 15, 2016",Awesome National Park,118,"Frisco, Texas",5

Badlands National Park,The Badlands is practically speaking almost a full day drive to take in all the sites.The rock formations and the geology that you see is unlike almost any other national park.I would suggest that if you are coming from Rapid City that you take RT 90 out to the visitor center near Wall.This stop will also give you information on the Grasslands park which is in proximity to the Badlands. There are limited services once you are out past Wall and in the parks. Make sure that you have ample fuel. We found it helpful to have some food and water in case we got hungry.,"June 7, 2016",Otherworldly landscape,35,"Mertztown, Pennsylvania",5
Badlands National Park,"I've reviewed the park already and it's perfect. Last night we went to the ranger talks. It was about birds, not my thing, but it was surprisingly very interesting. The ranger did a great job she was very knowledgable. Then was the star gazing...just wow! For some it's basic but for most it would be impressive! The guides were extremely patient and friendly. We were able to see Jupiter and Mars. We also were able to see the moon and several other neat things they pointed out. It was very dark and clear and you could see the Milky Way very good. My advice is to arrive early and watch the sunset and hang around for the programs. We found them to be worth it. Spend the night at the badlands inn, it's a mile away (book in advance).

Badlands National Park,"First, full-disclosure that I love to hike and am a huge geology nerd! All that aside, this place is a MUST STOP for everyone! The views are like nothing else that I have seen on Earth. Even if you just take the loop from I-90 to drive through, it is worth the entrance fee (I think is was $15). Lots of short trails to get out and stretch, see more than you can see from the car OR some longer trails if you want to make a day of it.","June 3, 2016",A Place Like No Other!,46,,5

We saw deer, big horn sheep and was told we just missed the buffalo. There is so much of America that I have not seen but I would put this on a must see list.","May 26, 2016",Wow!,25,"Elizabethtown, Kentucky",5
Badlands National Park,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the time to tour the Badlands or just head over to Yellowstone - I imagined it as just large canyons and I had already been to the Grand Canyon. I remembered my Mother loving it and she's not a nature person at all, so our family took the chance. We loved it! We entered the park at the Pinnacles entrance having come straight down from Wall. If you want to see the Prairie Dog Town, you need to backtrack at this point and we decided not to. Good decision as we saw another ""town"" closer to the Cedar Pass area. (look for the mounds). The landscape keeps changing as you drive around the park and it's all beautiful! We saw big horned sheep up close wandering the mountainsides. Entrance fee is $15 for a vehicle for the week.

Badlands National Park,"My two teenage daughters and I were passing through the area, and decided to take the 240 Scenic Loop. What a great idea.The scenery was amazing, with several pull-out spots to get a closer look or to take pictures. I live in the Pacific NW, so I sometimes take beautiful scenery for granted. This was very different, though, and fascinating to me. I loved the variety of rock formations among the hills.As far as wildlife goes, we saw a large herd of Big Horn Sheep when we first entered the park. There were several deer, a large variety of birds, and even a snake in the road. We saw fields of prairie dogs as we were leaving the park. Right outside the park gates, we saw two Buffalo (or Bison?) in a field just off the road.Our scenic drive, along with several stops for photos, took about 2 hours, and was definitely worth doing.","May 23, 2016",I Loved This!,28,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5
Badlands National Park,"This place is spectacular and unique. There isn't another place I've seen which is quite like it, and it is huge. There is a lot to see if you want to take it all in, You can spend a full day if you want, and more if you do some hikes. We spent only about an hour and a half because we were on tight schedule,and it wasn't on our original itinerary, but I'd like to return to make it a destination someday. It does have a hotel but you need to check on dates because it is closed at times of the year. There are far reaches to this place and two Visitor Centers to explore. There are many places to pull-off the road for a more detailed look at the rock formations, and you will want to for the color variations and the views. Morning and evening hours with low angle light makes for special photography. It was well worth our time even as short as it was.","May 23, 2016",Just take the time and see it,84,"Buena Vista, Colorado",5

Badlands National Park,This is my second trip to the Badlands and it's like I never really saw the wonder of it the first time around. It is an amazing place to visit. It's like being on another planet when you look around. It's beautiful and inspirational. They are having rattlesnake problems so there are signs all over to be watchful. It's a photographers paradise and there are lots of spots to pull off so you can get that perfect shot. There are a few boardwalks you can use to get further into the rock formations. I had never seen colored rocks until I came to the Badlands. The parks is right off interstate 90 west and you can plan on at least two or more hours to get through the loop depending how often you stop to take pictures and enjoy the views.

For those who can't walk a lot, there are short trails and they are boardwalks for ease. I saw many wild animals - bison, prairie dogs, deer, snakes (no rattlers but they are there !), pronghorn antelopes, big horn sheep, tons of birds, rabbits, chipmunks. The formations are so different from anywhere else, it's almost spooky.","May 7, 2016",Fantastic,94,"Monee, Illinois",5
