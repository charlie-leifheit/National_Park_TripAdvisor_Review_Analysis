Sequoia National Park,"Sequoia National Park was a humbling experience. The massive sequoia trees are breathtaking, but besides their physical beauty, they compel you to reflect on the brevity of life. The General Sherman was a seedling sometime between 700 BC - 300 BC. You’re literally walking around living things that were around when Ancient Greek philosophers and ancient Babylonian kings were alive. Our lives are nothing more than blinks compared to the lifespans of these giants.  ","October 17, 2019",An American Must-See,0,"Glendale, California",5
Sequoia National Park,We were absolutely wowed by this national park. Easy to navigate with safe roads. Staff were friendly helpful and informative. We followed one road that took us to most of the highlights. It wasn’t busy at all. We got to see a shy bear too! We did Yosemite the next day but enjoyed sequoia much more with Moro Rock being the highlight. The roads were much better and less busy although there are different things to see. ,"October 11, 2019",Enjoyed much more than Yosemite ,141,"Southampton, United Kingdom",5

Sequoia National Park,This place is stunning. Bigger than we’d imagined. Go see it for yourselves. You won’t be disappointed. The kids loved the trees & the waterfalls.

Sequoia National Park,"This forest is beautiful and cooler as you go up the mountains-literally with the temperature and the view too. The road is very curvy, and I was slightly car sick while we went through, but it was such a unique experience. The trees were huge and the views were amazing. Skip the Giant Tree Museum. The trees are giant, the museum is TINY and just explains why they changed the way they thought saving trees and using fire to help. The parking at the museum was hard to find. I would go to a different spot to park and then use the free shuttles to get around. ","August 26, 2019","Winding roads, pretty trees",6,,4

Sequoia National Park,Adjectives don’t do justice to this park! We went two days. The first night we were there to experience the night sky which was literally breathtaking and we came back the next morning and planned on sending 4 hours in the park but spent 6 because we wanted to see more and more. We should have allowed more time but we did this as a day trip while visiting family in Mission Viejo. We had a nice lunch from the grocery at Lodgepole. And we shopped in the visitors centers. The sequoias are awe inspiring. You know they are going to be towering but just to be there seeing them is fantastic!,"August 9, 2019",The best part of our vacation!,8,"Virginia Beach, Virginia",5

Sequoia National Park,"Firstly, to see the sequoias you have to go to the top of the mountain. I've been there in December and it was pretty cold at that time. Be also prepared to be dizzy and nauseous. There are many curves until the top of the mountain. Going up was not a problem, but when we return... hoo gosh, my mother and I were very sick. In the bottom of the mountain there is an AMAZING restaurant and hotel. I suggest to stop by there to order a cup of soup and a hot tea to recover from the trip. And enjoy the beautiful view from the restaurant!","August 6, 2019",Sequoia park,11,"Madison, Wisconsin",5
Sequoia National Park,The park is beautiful and serene. There is a sense of peace as you walk among these majestic trees. It was awe-inspiring!What I didn't enjoy about it was the trip into the park! I am terrified of heights and didn't realize we would be so high up. The road leading in and out was only two lanes and it was very narrow and curvy. ,"August 5, 2019",Beautiful and Majestic!!,9,,4
Sequoia National Park,Excellent trip to this park. Free shuttles to take you to the various sites but you can walk a lot of it so you get a real feel for the size of the trees and the beautiful scenery. Highlights were the Sherman tree and Moro rock. Make sure you aren’t scared of narrow paths and heights for the latter!Driving into the park from the south is also ‘fun’. Be prepared for a long drive. It is only 20 miles or so but takes 90 minutes as the road twists and turns and you can only go at about 15 mph!,"July 26, 2019",Must be seen to be believed!,5,East Grinstead,5
Sequoia National Park,"I took the V-Line ($10 one-way) and got the stop at Fresno state (in the little cul-de-sac) very early in the morning. I had a good wait before the Sequoia shuttle in Visalia ($20 roundtrip) was due to arrive. Most everything in the town was closed. But there is an Arby's within walking of the depot that is within walking distance that you can go to. The actual park was wonderful. The forest is magnificent. Much quieter than Yosemite (which would seem like Disney World in crowd size by comparison) and you are actually walking through the trees, rather than the cliff-hugging paths I did at Yosemite.I highly recommend you buy a trail map because there are no trail maps/you-are-here signs once in the wood. I got lost. Not stepping off the path, just one trail turning into another and not knowing how to get back, or even out of the park. Some kind folks with a map helped me.The view from Moro was wonderful. I'm glad I did that first, as those stairs are no joke, and I might not have had the energy after all the walking through the forest.But lovely spot, definitely recommend everyone have a go!","July 11, 2019",Wonderful (but easy to get lost),17,NYC,5

Sequoia National Park,"Visited the park on 5/30. We stayed in Visalia which was about 1.5 hrs away from where general Sherman was located. There is lodging in Three Rivers, but you’re still 1 hr away from general Sherman. It’s really preference as to where you want to stay, but we enjoyed staying in Visalia which had various restaurants and other places to visit. There is a fee to enter the sequoia national park. For a single standard vehicle it was $35 . You can pay at the gate or buy it online and just show the ranger your mobile device, which is what we did. There are plenty of places to stop and take pictures, so make sure your cameras are fully charged and ready to go. Because of the time of the year we went, there was no need for bug repellent and the temp was approximately 54F. Prior to getting to the top of the trail that leads to general Sherman, there is a handicap parking lot at the bottom of the trail so there is no need to walk the entire trail if someone in your party can not hike for long distance. Keep in mind the change in temperature that will occur as a result of traveling 6000+ feet up. In Visalia it was 89F and as mentioned above, it was close to 54F up there. Views are breathtaking. Highly recommend coming up here.","June 4, 2019",General Sherman ,4,"Rosamond, California",5

Sequoia National Park,"If you're not humbled and in awe of these trees, then you are not human. Much like the Grand Canyon, it is impossible to catch the feeling in a photo or put into words. You just have to see it.Moro Rock is a ""must-hike"" if you can stomach the vertigo (even if you think you can't - power through it, you can thank me later).Take the shuttle from the museum to Moro Rock and do that hike, then jump back on the shuttle and go over to Crescent Meadows and take the stroll around and get up close and personal with the trees. My advice that seemed to work well for us - start at the Three Rivers entrance AS EARLY AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN in the morning to ""get ahead"" of the crowds. Since the road is basically the only one going through the park, you will be at the front of the ""train"" of people arriving later. You'll be the first to the major attractions like Moro Rock, and will enjoy relative solitude on the way up. On your way down, you'll notice more people showing up to start their journey, but you'll be on to the next place where you'll again be in relative solitude. Rinse, repeat. Do the Kings' Canyon at the end of the day, since this is the less popular (but still beautiful) side of the parks.Don't expect to get clean shots at the big attraction: General Sherman. Too many people. But if you do get the rare chance to be the only one in the picture with the tree, snap your pic quickly and let the next people go. If everyone did this, everything would work smoothly. ","May 30, 2019",BIG TREES!!! BIG HIKES!!! BIG FUN!!!,45,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5
Sequoia National Park,"I think I'll add something different from the usual. No doubt the giant beautiful and majestic Sequoias, including General Grant and General Sherman, are worth the visit. But if you're fortunate enough to notice and appreciate the following, then that is a bonus. It occurred when we left the park early to avoid the traffic jam that would come when most visitors left before a 6 p.m. closure because of impending snow.Route 180 out of the park often has 10-mile-an-hour curves. Often as you round them, your car's engine is so quiet and there are no birds or wind that you are in utter tranquil silence. That is as enjoyable as the fantastic scenery.","May 26, 2019",Utterly majestic.,80,"peachtree city, ga",5
Sequoia National Park,"Wow, what a stunning place Sequoia National Park is! We are on road trip but this wasn’t on our trip list, however, due to unforeseen circumstances we had to take a detour to Bakersfield and so a stop at Sequoia worked out well, and I was bowled over. To get into the park you have to pay a fee of $35, but it’s a 7 day pass, although we only had the one day. We decided on the Forest of the giant trees and it was amazing. Whilst it had and was snowing it added to the Beaty of the park. If you are going to do any of the trails, wear comfortable shoes, trainers should be fine, and consider the weather conditions in advance. There are rest rooms and there was also a trailer for purchasing snacks, although it was closed. This Forest was enchanting, and if you are around for a few days then I would recommend a couple of visits. The absolute highlight was the General Sherman, the oldest living thing in the world, a must see and the photos do not do it justice.","May 25, 2019",Big is definitely beautiful!,2,"Chigwell, United Kingdom",5
Sequoia National Park,"Hoping to see the big trees, we entered the park but the ranger accurately told us that it was an hour drive to get to them. We hoped she was wrong, but she wasn't. We drove in the curvy roads for nearly 30 minutes but realized that we wouldn't get to the big trees until late, so we turned around, disappointed.","May 23, 2019",Nice greeting at entrance but distance to big trees was an hour.,155,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",4
Sequoia National Park,"We recently visited several national parks in California this past April including two days in Sequoia National Park. We found this to be a great park for easy and short hikes and we very enjoyed being able to see the giant sequoias with snow on the ground. During our time in Sequoia National Park we stayed at the Wuksachi Lodge just off the General's Highway. This is an excellently located property just a few miles from the Giant Forest and much sightseeing in this area of the national park. We had a poor dinner at their feature restaurant called The Peak. However, there is a Lodgepole Village store nearby where we found a casual grill and were able to pick up traditional supermarket foods which were consumed in our hotel. We very much enjoyed the hikes and being able to spend time amongst the hundreds of giant sequoias in the Giant Forest. We hiked the General Sherman, Congress and Big Tree Trail, all of which were enjoyable. We also had a good time hiking out to Moro Rock and the Tunnel Log along the Crescent Meadow Trail, which starts at the Giant Forest Museum. The museum was worth the 30 minutes spent here, learning about the giant sequoias, their life cycle and the grove in general. Note that during the winter months, while the Lodgepole Visitor Centre is closed, the Giant Museum serves as a backup visitor centre, a good place to talk to rangers and to find out information about trail and road conditions. Parking was not an issue first thing in the morning but as more and more vehicles poured into the park by midday we found it more challenging to find spots near the areas we wanted to hike. There is a large carpark just across from the museum as well as free Sequoia shuttle service although we didn't find need to make use of this service during our late April visit. In the end, we found 2 days to be a fair amount of time to see the highlights such as the General Sherman Tree and those mentioned above. However, it is not enough time to explore the national park more thoroughly. For that, we would have preferred a couple more days, especially for taking in longer hikes. This is a national park that we look forward to visiting again in the future.","May 22, 2019",Land of the giant sequoias,18552,"Hong Kong, China",5

Sequoia National Park,"I have uterrly fallen in love with this place. I was wanting to drive on the Generals Highway from Grant Grove to Three Rivers but due to the fact that it was March and the road was still closed at certain points, we decided to go straight to Three Rivers and go up to General Sherman from there. We had a rental so snow chains were out of the question so it was very much in the hands of the universe. Weather seemed decent the few days before so we were hopeful. It was super sunny in Three Rivers (shorts and t-shirt sunny) so we stopped for a quick break and to check what's happening up top. A nice fella from a shop told us that it snowed the night before so we definitely need chains from mid way cause the temperature changes fast and it's much colder but to go ask the rangers. We drove to the park entrance and to our luck, the snow chain restrictions were lifted 5 minutes before and we were okay to go up. The road is amazing! Beautiful to drive on! The views till about 1500m are your typical mountain views. Once you go past the cloud barrier it becomes quite cold and surprise, quite snowy! It was end of March so I wasn't expecting that much snow, but it was a happy surprise. I've never seen sequoias before and I was just stunned by the beauty - amazingly high trees with 2 meters of snow around! Parking was a bit of a pain but we waited patiently and we found a place. We then walked 1 minute to see General Sherman! Majestic, so so majestic! I loved it so much. Although super snowy, the temperature wasn't too bad, but still thick jacket and proper winter shoes were needed. I would love to come back in the summer and do the whole road but I'm so happy I got to see it in winter. So beautiful, I didn't want to leave. If you have the chance, go both seasons! Worth it, even the hassle of putting snow chains if needed. Wish we had more time to go do some hikes and take our time in the park. Definitely recommend!!!","May 16, 2019",Fell in love with this place,51,"Teddington, United Kingdom",5
Sequoia National Park,"Such a beautiful national park! It was for sure worth the drive up the winding roads. The Sequoia trees are stunning but there are still a lot else to enjoy, especially if it has recently snowed","April 29, 2019",Breath taking experience!,8,"Varde, Denmark",5
Sequoia National Park,"We entered the park about 10:30 am through the Ash Oak entrance just after Three Rivers (last place for chains is just before the enraince (Totem market and gifts) and took the main road North to the big trees. If you are prone to car sickness and/or have difficulty driving twisty roads and want to see the bigger trees, don't use this entrance. Going North on this road, the roads are so twisted, it looks like a toddler scribbled on the map, and they based the road on that. I don't suffer car sickness and got a bit dizzy on the drive. If you do get car sick, you should instead enter through the Big Stump entrance and drive South to the big trees. This wont work if you want to see the other parts of the park near the ""scribbled"" road, only if you're interested in JUST the larger trees and in the winter/spring, snow and snowplay. You can avoid the worst of the road driving from North to the South. Now, if you're prone to issues with heights? You'll want to drive the opposite way, South to North, that way you're driving up the worst of the roads and you can't see directly how steep it is were you to drive down. I absolutely believe everyone should drive through if possible instead of doubling back. We drove through, stopping wherever we saw something interesting. With the heavy rains this year, the rivers and waterfalls were full, the park has its own super bloom of wildflowers, and there was plenty of snow at the higher elevations. We greatly enjoyed the giant forest museum. If you park in the farthest parking lot, there's a staircase you'll need to walk down to get to the museum, with the snow I don't remember seeing a ramp, but there appeared to be closer handicapped parking if you have a placard. Right by these steps are some rocks that are the perfect place to stand to get a photo with the Sentinel tree, which sits just outside the museum. You'll be able to see the entire tree in your photo with your family at close range. I would recommend the museum to everyone first, it's quick and easy and has a little store and a kid's activity packet. From there I would do the big trees trail - ""a panel near the start of Big Trees Trail explains: In Giant Forest, sequoias grow bigger than anywhere else, and Round Meadow is one of the best sequoia habitats within the Giant Forest.""Hikespeak. Even in late April, there was so much snow that the trail was mostly covered. We're mostly sure we hiked the trail thanks to the markings in the trees. However, after 30 minutes we had to turn back as downed trees and deep snow prevented us from seeing where the trail continued. I'm told the path is paved and mostly flat, but could not verify this due to the 8-12 plus inches of snow, slush, and ice. We had the kids in snow and hiking boots, but my friend and I both wore tennis shoes that made walking in the snow very difficult. I would love to go back here and do the congress trail as well, based on what I saw, I'm thinking it would be less steep than to do the general Sherman trail with the 200+ foot elevation changes and many stairs. Take your time up here, the elevation makes things difficult. Make sure you hydrate well and don't refill bottles or wash food in bathroom sinks. I spent time explaining to a foreign tourist that she shouldn't wash her fruit in water marked not potable. There aren't a whole lot of bathrooms around here, bring clean water or use drinking fountains only, even to wash fruit. If you're someone who just wants to see the park and only do hikes of an hour or less, spend the day, you can take in some amazing vistas in a day. I do not recommend driving these roads at night. Bring an extra pair of shoes and socks, even waterproof hiking boots got soaked through in the snow. I recommend Wolverton for snow play, we found lots of people sledding there and just going there for the day to hang out and play.","April 29, 2019","This park is a must see, I enjoyed this almost more than Yosemite.

Sequoia National Park,"Yes - it predates Yosemite as a national park; kind of hard to fathom any ""terrible"" reviews. We spent a very short time there as we didn't have much time to begin with and drove down for the day from Modesto. Locking the keys in the rental car (who knew you can lock remote entry keys in a car? Mine you can't!) cost us more time as dealt with finding employees to let us use the phone, being on hold for a while, and waiting for the park-located AAA affiliated fellow to get there to unlock us (once Thrifty put us through to Chevrolet - which informed us that On Star wouldn't work ""in a National Park"" and that they were sending someone - which would have taken hours - the in-park guy cost us $70, but was there in a half hour). All that was forgotten, however, in the midst of the trees (and the snow, which, while temps in the foothills and valleys were near 90, was still over the roofs of the Lodgepole buildings). Everything here is big - the trees, the mountains, the granite peaks, the snowfall...no wondering why it was our second national park.We would have liked to go on to King's Canyon, but they don't sell gasoline in the parks and even though we certainly had enough, after the key incident I was a little paranoid about car issues (did I really know the gauge on this rental and how accurate it was at half a tank? How much farther could we really go???)Be prepared - dress accordingly (bring jackets in the spring even if it is 90 in Visalia), know your cell phone will be useless, stock up on snacks or whatever (although there is a small shop and snack bar at Lodgepole).Also, going in to the park through the small foothill towns of Lemon Cove (full of orange groves), Three Rivers, etc., is an experience in itself.","April 22, 2019","Our Second National Park, First in California",347,"new haven, ct",5

Sequoia National Park,"If you've never been here before, I hope the recent fires in the vicinity (and at other parks) have pushed you to visit Sequoia in case anything should ever happen to it.If you're coming from SoCal and Yosemite seems like too far a drive (or you can't get reservations) this is a great option to see exquisite nature closer to home. If you think large trees are boring, think again. You will be astonished at the monumental size of these giants and the easy walks that lead you through them. While turnouts and less popular trails are not as easy to find as they are in other parks, the main points of interest (General Sherman, Giants Walk) will give you enough for a two-day trip. Many campsites are available with varying amenities (sans crowds and feeling like you are at the Disneyland of national parks.) Quieter facilities with better privacy and shade EVERYWHERE makes this a perfect spot for a summer weekend, even in the heat as the shade areas do not heat up as much.Tip: Since it is more secluded, convenience stores are not as readily available as in other parks. Bring plenty of snacks and food from the grocery stores in Visalia and you'll avoid driving the winding roads for food you don't even like.Yes, there is shade, but never substitute that for sunscreen!","March 24, 2019","The Closer, Quieter National Park",56,"Los Angeles, California",4

Sequoia National Park,"We visited over the weekend when it was not snowing but there was lots of settled snow. A lot of trails were closed for vehicles. We did not do much of hiking but did lots of snow play. We did see General Sherman and it is majestic.Couple of tips:In case you are visiting during winter,1. Carry chains even if the weather is clear. The weather could change anytime2. If it has snowed, the road from Three rivers is the only way to reach the park.In case you are staying at Wuksachi and travelling from SFO area, sometimes maps directs you from the other highway from Kings canyon side. This road is mostly CLOSED if it has snowed. So during winter, make sure you check which road is open. 3. Weather changes constantly during winter, so make sure you follow the weather updates a couple of days in advance and enter the park accordingly. We realised that there were days they did not allow vehicles to enter after 5pm when it snowed heavy.This is an amazing park. It is not too crowded .

Also, because of the time of year, there was some snow which was cool, but there was a tremendous amount of fog so we couldn't fully appreciate the views but did find what we could see to be ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!

Sequoia National Park,"The park is magical. There is so much to see, there's no way to see everything in a single trip. From spotting wildlife to the awe-inspiring giant sequoias to the breathtaking mountain and river scenery, there's something amazing around every corner. The drive up starts out as beautiful high desert views with live oaks and wild flowers and the higher you go in altitude, the more lush and dense the forest becomes until you reach the giant sequoia trees. A great place for a day trip and nice picnic and short hike, or for the more adventurous, you can hike into the back country and experience nature virtually untouched by humans. The park can be very crowded during weekends and holidays - my advice is if you are going for the day to start up super early and either do the loop or what we typically do, which is start from Visalia and go up as high as Wuksachi and then back down, making different stops on the way up and down. There are several places to stop along the way to picnic or hike. Giant forest has a beautiful walk around Crescent Meadow and a really nice picnic area at Pinewood. Across from Hospital Rock picnic area, there is an awesome spot to see ancient Native American pictographs, which is yet another aspect to the park. As long as you start your trip very early (we try to leave by 6:30 a.m.), you can get up and do what you want without the traffic and crowds on weekends and holidays. As you make your way down to leave the park, you will see what I mean! The traffic can be bumper to bumper and all the spots super crowded. Week days are definitely better if you're able to swing it.All this sightseeing is going to make you hungry and there are not many places to stop to buy food, so be sure to come prepared! Lodgepole, which is quite a ways up from Visalia (about 1 hour 45 mins), does offer a grocery store and small restaurant with pre-packaged sandwiches and salads, but the groceries are super expensive so I strongly advise that you bring an ice chest and your own food! It can be a tough day for very young children because it's a lot of driving, and the drive is twisting and turning. Head's up if you are someone who gets car sick! Bottom line though, it's something everyone should see if you have any interest whatsoever in nature. People visit from all over the world, and with good reason!","November 13, 2018",Nothing Like it in the World - Pack your lunch!,7,"Visalia, California",5

Sequoia National Park,"We were only in California for a few days and my cousin lives in Visalia, CA so she decided to take us to Sequoia National Park. It's definitely a long drive but well worth it. Entrance fee is $35 per car and the lady had mentioned about a shuttle, but there was so many of us that I couldn't understand what the shuttle was for. The trip itself to get to the park was tedious and very long. Going up the mountain was an adventure of its own. With so many turns and winding roads, it felt nauseating to be the passenger. But with many spots to take pictures of the view, it was well worth it. You can't beat the view. The mountains and the trees was breathtakingly beautiful. When we finally got up to the park and walked to the biggest tree known as the General Sherman, it was well worth the trip. I've never seen anything like it. These sequoia trees are huge! It's so beautiful to look at, that I was lost for words because I've never seen anything like it. From what I gathered during our trip, there are many campgrounds and lodges throughout the park. I did see a Crystal Cave tour but it was closed for the season as well as a tour to Moro Rock but we missed the shuttle bus for that. For anyone who wants to visit this beautiful park, plan ahead and leave early. There's so much to do here that I feel like we didn't even touch the surface of this park. Definitely check out there website and plan ahead. This must be in everyone's to-do list.","November 7, 2018",Amazing,19,"Gurnee, Illinois",5

Sequoia National Park,"This park is huge! It can take you an hour to drive from one spot to another. Entrance fee is $35. You can pre pay online to make things faster. We went in through the 198 entrance. The visitors center was a mile in. Don’t pass it up. They can help you plan your day based on how much time you have. On our way to our first stop, we saw a bear with its cub. That was awesome. We saw plenty of wildlife. They kept to themselves. We just admired fromafar. We stared at the Moro rock. We made the mistake of taking the trail by the museum. It added 1.3 miles one way and the last 400 stairs were no joke. With it being over 6000 feet above sea level, the air does thin out. It was worth it for the beautiful view. We even snacked on our peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on the top. If you don’t want to go the extra miles, just drive up to the bottom of the rock. Other notable hikes and spots include the Sherman tree, the tunnel log, the museum and the congress trail. There are many more, but I would have needed more than one day to explore it allParking wasn’t bad for October, but I can see how it would be difficult in the summer. They had a sign saying tire chains were required sat over 7000 feet, but the ranger told us we didn’t need them that day. We didn’t have any on us, so I’m not sure what would have happened if we needed them. Bathrooms are available at almost every major stop. Just remember these are pale bathrooms. They are basic and pretty much just a faculty with doors and stalls. They do have an area near the Sherman tree that has a store that sells almost anything you forgot.

The sheer size and beauty of these trees are magnificent and the place has been maintained exceptionally well for the number of visitors it has coming through the place. It is a little sad how many unnatural paths and rails need to be put in to make it more accessible for people and it takes away from the beauty of the forest, but only minimally.

Sequoia National Park,"My boyfriend and I visited Sequoia National Parks on Sept. 22,2018. We stopped by the visitor center to get some recommendations for a visit and advice on a few of the sites we wanted to see. The Info Desk worker named Grant gave us his recommendations for the visit. Which were fine however, we asked about the ability to see everything on our lisr and to see the Crystal Cave. He responded, “I wouldn’t recommend doing the Cave besides you can visit a cave anywhere.” He also didn’t tell us the visitor center was one of a few places in the park where you could purchase tickets AND that you couldn’t purchase tickets at the cave. My boyfriend and I ignored his inappropriate comments about the cave and decided if we were able to see the other sites on our list in time we would stop by the cave. So we did just that but upon entrance into the Cave lot a signed was posted that indicated tickets had to be purchased at the Foothills Viaitor Center which was at least 30 minutes away. We were shocked and frankly upset. When we got to the Cave info booth they explained they could put us on a waiting list but it would be better to come back the next day. We weren’t able to get into the cave and the next day we were leaving so unable to come back to the cave.

Sequoia National Park,Lovely to see and learn about these amazing trees. Photos can’t do justice to their immense size and scale - they have to be experienced up close and personal. Sherman and Grant are the best places to aim for although they are divided by a long drive. It takes time to drive into this park and this is exacerbated by roadworks that can have you wait the best part of an hour to pass on a weekday ( 20 mins at the weekend). Be sure to check the details of when cars are allowed to pass so you don’t end up sitting needlessly on the side of the road in the blazing sun.

We saw all the park highlights on a slow pace and between driving and walking, two days will be what you need. Add time for extra day hikes. Like any National Park, food quality is limited and expensive. Bring your supplies to defray cost. Park staff are exceptional and take the time to stop at the visitor center and Sequoia museum to get an orientation.

Sequoia National Park,"I wanted to see the tallest tree while in the US but instead I went to the biggest tree, Sherman. To be honest I was very confused about what to do and where to go to see what. So I will comment on this aspect of my trip and hopefully help anyone in the same position. With limited time, I picked a green part of the map with the word Sequoia in it that we could reach from our destination. We traveled from Lompoc to the Foothills Visitor Centre via Visalia and 3 Rivers. 3 Rivers is the last place you can get petrol and water for a while so stock up if you are low. Entry is about $35 US.We stopped at the visitor centre and I would recommend doing this for helpful info from the rangers. At the time of our visit they were doing road works and their advice saved us around an hour of just sitting in the car. This brings me to my biggest realisation, you don’t do much walking/hiking here, you drive through the park. There is a fully paved road right through from the foothills to Kings Canyon Road, at which point you can choose east, Kings Canyon, or exit the park, which we did, towards Fresno. There are numerous car parks along the way to get out and see certain features, such as Hospital Rock or, the Sherman Tree. The drive is tight and winding, you don’t really go over 25 mph, (40 Kph) for the most part. As you drive there are turn out spaces for viewing and taking photos. The mountains are spectacular and I would love to have had a geologist with me to talk about the formations. About half way through you enter the Giant Grove and there are parking lots etc to get out and walk. We found this a bit confusing at first as we were not sure where to go to see Sherman but we kept driving and soon saw the signs. If you wanted to walk more this would be the better option, wait till you see the signs to Sherman and park there. It’s a 15 minute (or so) walk downhill to see the tree then a further downhill walk to see other feature trees. Then at the bottom, at the first car park, there is a free shuttle to take you back to the Sherman car park. We didn’t walk the whole lot as it was a very hot day and we were worried about the time. The walk to the tree is fully paved with some helpful signs. We visited in July and there were a lot of people there. We saw Sherman, which was impressive in its own way, you can’t go close to it because there is a fence to protect the root system, fair enough. We saw a deer and some. chipmunks, cute! But with so many people some of the joy was taken out, like lining up to take a stupid photo in front of the tree, and just to get close to anything. It wasn’t the nature experience I thought it would be. We drove out of the park, towards our destination in Fresno. I’m not sure exactly but the whole drive was probably 2 hours, maybe 3, including walking time. If we had more time I would have gone to Kings Canyon and I would suggest that staying at the foothills area, or a nearby town, one night, then driving through to a destination town for the next night is a good way to do it. It honestly felt like just another tourist attraction, not an amazing forest. I was a bit disappointed but also glad to have done it. It might be better in a cooler time of year and not US holiday period, but it may be busy all year.","July 30, 2018",Spectacular landscape,7,"Greater Bendigo, Australia",3
Sequoia National Park,"We moved here when I was 10 years old and i have been traveling to the giant Sequoia Forest as often as I can for over forty years. Though a little crowded at times with tourists, the Giants are truly a wonder to behold. Just be aware that it takes an early morning start, even though it may not that far in miles according to the road signs, you cannot drive fast on the winding mountain roads. And driving down in the dark is a challenge. The Park is also a great escape when the valley is hot. Enjoy!","July 29, 2018",Privileged to live so close,3,"Orlando, Florida",5
Sequoia National Park,"The tallest treCaliforniaes in the world only grow in central and northern , so if you’re visiting near here, I highly recommend trying to see them. They are truly magnificent! My wife and I visited Sequoia National Park for the first and last time 23 years ago, a few months after we were married. That time we camped in the park for two nights and really enjoyed it. This time we took our 18 and 12 year old daughters so that they could see the magnificent trees in the Giant Forest, even though we drove through the redwoods on Pacific Coast Highway two years ago. We didn’t camp this time, and instead stayed at the Lamp Liter Inn in Visalia (where there was no air conditioning in the 105°F heat), and drove to the park from there. The 2500 year old (give or take 200 years) General Sherman is the largest tree in the world in terms of volume of wood that it contains (over 52,000 cubic feet). It’s about half the age of the oldest known living tree, and at 275 feet tall, it’s about 105 feet shorter than the Hyperion redwood, but since the location of Hyperion is secret, this one is probably the most spactacular tree I’ll ever see! Five of the ten biggest trees on the planet are in the Giant Forest. Crystal Cave is very interesting also. We went on that tour the first time, but didn’t have time to do it on this trip. The entire park is really beautiful and is very much worth a visit of a day or several days if you’re going to be in the area.","July 29, 2018",Magnificent!,45,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5
Sequoia National Park,"We visited over 2 days while staying in Visalia. What an amazing place! Drive up to around the 7,000 ft area and there are multiple groves of Sequoia you can visit. These trees are MASSIVE! And many of them are over 3,000 years old. They look like alien trees amongst the ‘normal’ trees. You literally can’t see these monsters anywhere else. Over 20 years ago, I used to come to Visalia on business 3 or 4 times a year but never made it out to the park. Glad I decided to see it this time around.

Sequoia National Park,"We took the Sequoia shuttle from Visalia to the park and utilized the shuttles within the park once we arrived. We arrived on the earliest shuttle about 8:30 am. I asked one of the park shuttle drivers what she recommended we do first to avoid crowds and the heat of the day. She said moro rock. I'm glad we took her advice it was 345 steps to the top and worth every step. What an amazing view! I'm glad we started our day with that climb rather than waiting until later in the day. We may not have done it after walking the other trails. The driver also said that stair railing gets hot in the heat of the day. Afterward, we did the hike from Moro Rock to Crescent Meadow. About halfway we encountered a bear! Amazing and a bit scary. We made noise and it ran away from us (thankfully). Still, the best part of the day. We shuttled to General Sherman trail and the Congress Trail. Both hikes were great. There was a line for pictures at General Sherman. Amazing to be among these giants! We stopped at the Lodgepole market and bought some souvenirs and snacks. Lastly, we walked a meadow loop trail that was near the museum. The shuttle ride back to Visalia was way better than driving ourselves after a busy day in the park. ","July 19, 2018","Wow, those are some huge trees!I",17,"Moon Township, Pennsylvania",5

Sequoia National Park,"This is the premier location to see the giant Sequoia trees. Note that 90% of the tourists go no father than the General Sherman Tree, which is near the parking lots and is easily accessible. There is a fence around it and a waiting line to take a pic by the tree's sign! Just 1/2 mile away on the 2 mile Congress Trail there are trees just as impressive (ok, 2 inches smaller in diameter!) with no fence and only 1 or 2 other tourists, even on a busy summer weekend! So, if you want to hug a giant tree and get away from the crowd, just hike the Congress Trail!Arriving early morning is another way to beat the crowds. Note that there is road construction in the park at the time of writing and you may have to wait up to 1 hour to pass the 1 lane section! Also, while the park's website says that the park is open 24 hours, it is currently closing at 8 pm and opening at 6 am due to the road construction. Best to call and get up to date info if you are on a tight timeline.Parking was a pain. We arrived at 11 am and the main lots were already full. So we had to park a mile further up the road in the overflow lot and take a shuttle back to the General Sherman trail. The drive to the General Sherman Tree from the park entrance takes 50 min or more. Be prepared.The entrance fee is $35 per car! Good for 1 week at both Sequoia and Kings Canyon.We saw 1 baby Bear and 1 Mule Deer. Would return again, off season and earlier in the day.","July 11, 2018",Wonderful Trees! Notes Below,249,,4
Sequoia National Park,"We've been to many of the major parks in the past years and this one always fell of the list, since we had other things to see and do that seemed more important and not enough time. This summer, we finally decided to go, especially since my parents joined us for a road trip and the giant sequoia trees were on the very top of their list. The park is small and the facilities and things to do a bit more limited, but the trees itself were amazing! We loved the fresh air and multiple hiking trails around the park. The drive up is already an adventure, 1 hour of windy roads up and I think a bit longer going down using the south entrance. My hubby was glad we tackled the drive down when there was still some daylight left. We were also excited when we figured out that our minivan fit into the drive through tree log, sooo hilarious!

We should have used SR 180 for both entrance and exit as SR 198 has “hairpin” turns posted at 10 mph, and a portion of the roadway was washed out causing delays of up to a half an hour. The trail to the General Sherman Tree is fully paved. Bring lots of water for the hike due to the thin air at the 7,000+ foot elevation. The Lodgepole Visitor Center and Village is just signed Lodgepole, so we missed the village. We were able to check out the Wuksachi Lodge which has an elegant lobby and a convenient snack shop. We stopped by Stony Creek Village on our way out. This village is quite small with restrooms in a detached portable building.

Sequoia National Park,"We used the Sequoia Shuttle from our hotel in Visalia into the park. The road in was very steep and extremely curvy. I was happy to have a driver. Our plan was to see the highlights and take a few short hikes. We arrived at Giant Forest Museum early (8:15 am) and wanted to go to General Sherman first to beat the crowds. However, a inner-park shuttle didn’t arrive until 9:00. The museum was also closed until 9:00. There is a trail behind the museum that was an easy walk. We took the green shuttle to the General Sherman and were dropped off at the handicapped parking. This is the shortest walk to the tree. There were other large trees and some educational placards along the way. Afterward, we walked the Congress Trail to see the other named trees. The trail was fairly empty. The trees were stunning. Another shuttle was needed to get to Lodgepole. We walked through the visitor center and ate at the cafe. The food was tasty and not terribly expensive. By the time we left Lodgepole to return to Giant Forest Museum, the shuttles were ridiculously crowded. Far too many people were crammed on to each bus. We transferred to another shuttle to arrive at Moro Rock. The steps to Moro Rock are daunting, but the view is worth it. Overall, the shuttle system to get to major sights seemed better than navigating the traffic and lack of parking in some areas. But it will take some planning and patience to maximize the use of the shuttle system. ","July 3, 2018",A must see (with a dose of patience)! ,47,"Vonore, Tennessee",5
Sequoia National Park,"This and it’s neighbor park, kings canyon, are just beautiful. During hot days it can be nice in the mountains. The main reason to come is to see theMagnificent giant sequoia’s. Again just stunning. If sensitive to heights while driving. First you will experience mountain drives. You can limit significant amounts by driving from the north to south. During much of this (in particular the zig zag portion near the southern entrance) you will be on the inside lane (between center stripe and mountain). Some of the narrowest parts now have a two foot wall in the drop-off side. Be sure to stop by General Sherman at Giant Forest. If you are disabled they have parking adjacent to the trail. All others follow the signs and park up the mountain from the trail. It is downhill all the way but uphill all the way back. Bring some water. It is a beautiful trail. This is the highlight.

Sequoia National Park,Visited the park on a Monday. We stayed at the Comfort Inn in Three Rivers and for a small fee Road the shuttle into the park which took you to the giant forest Museum. From there they have a pretty good shuttle system that takes you to various points of interest throughout the park. We went in early in the morning and there were hardly any people there of course by noon time the place was pretty crowded but the shuttle system seemed to be keeping up with the crowds. The Lodgepole Visitor Center was pretty crowded but it's next to a camp ground so people are there for food showers and supplies. There's a small Grill at the Lodgepole Center for a quick bite to eat or you can buy groceries. We were there for a day visit but there is camping and lodging inside the park. There are plenty of trails to hike. We enjoyed the Big Trees trail which starts from forest Museum and goes down to the round Meadow. It's and easy hike and accessible with a nice paved path. We were lucky enough to see a black bear eating grass in the meadow while on the hike. If I had to do it over again I think I would leave early and drive into the park myself park at the forest Museum and use the shuttle system. That way you're not trapped waiting for your scheduled shuttle to take you back out of the park you can leave when you're ready.

General Sherman tree, the largest tree in the world and also the largest living organism in the world, is situated in this park and it is a classic cinnamon coloured Sequoia tree.There are innumerable trails winding through thick jungle mainly formed with Sequoia and Redwood trees,some with mild inclinations, some with very tough climb, all offering pleasing view of the jungle, valley and mountain peaks. The trail around Crescent Meadows is mostly on flat ground and offers a picturesque view of the green meadows from different points .Quarter mile\ 400 steps ride to Moro Rock, though tough, is worth taking to enjoy breathtaking valley and mountain views.For young and fit with ample time at disposal , there many camping and tracking opportunities.Sighting opportunities for wild animals is limited in the crowded visitor accessible areas near the roads.

We decided to do dispersed camping to try and save some money so we asked in the visitor centre where we could. The assistant on the desk was very helpful and gave us a map with all the dispersed camping sites on. There were plenty of trails for us to do so we decided on Mount Baldy, a 4.5 round trip hike. Weather was good and the view from the top was amazing. After our hike we went back and set up camp and then decided to go to the lake. The water was absolutely freezing but it was so refreshing and was nice to see families enjoying the water. We stayed for about an hour or so before getting out and going back to chill at the campsite. Our campsite was in the national forest so was a little while out.

There's a huge area of one way due to major road construction.If you visit on the weekends you will park at the Museum and take shuttle buses to all of the top sites. And it's a very well-run shuttle bus system. The buses drop you very close to the site. I hiked to the top of Moro Rock in zero visibility. There was absolutely no view, but the hike was still pretty fun.The museum and Visitor Center isn't all of that. It's a good place to use the restroom and get some quick information, but there are far better museums and information points that focus on Sequoias and redwoods.This park does not seem like a good drive, stop, and look Park. It might have just been the bad weather and traffic, but I did not feel inspired to stop at any of the turn out.My only real issue with this park is that it administered together with Kings Canyon National Park. This makes it very difficult for visitors to interpret information about the park. The website and driving maps are very confusing when it comes to where one part stops and the other one starts. The driving maps are way too cluttered with information. They should really issue to separate Maps and treat the park as two separate entities.

I always refer to this place as Yosemite's forgotten cousin because it gets far fewer crowds than neighboring YNP which makes it much less crowded and much more peaceful. There is nothing like standing next to these big trees and feeling like a little, tiny spec. General Sherman Tree is always a good one to make you feel this way. But really, all the trees are just giant and serene. To get away from the crowds head for the trails. The Zumwalt Meadow Trail is an easy one for the littles. We even saw a bear cub on this trail. At that point we paused in our walk and let him/her be on his/her merry way since we figured mama was not far behind. Crystal Cave is another little gem in this park. It is a good introduction to caving if you or your kids have never toured one. Just make reservations early as they book up. June is our favorite time of year to go. Weather is mild and the rivers are full.","April 18, 2018",One of our favorite national parks,25,"San Francisco, California",5

Wherever you go you get to see these giant trees which was cool.","April 12, 2018",Massive trees!,24,,5
Sequoia National Park,"Tired of dealing with the crowds in Yosemite? Then drive a little south to Sequoia and enjoy the majesty of these amazing trees with about 75% fewer tourists than you'll deal with in Yosemite. Stop at one of the Visitor Centers to get your bearings, take plenty of food, gas, and water (limited services in the Park), and enjoy the many trails in the park, and the amazing views of these majestic giants. The roads are narrow and winding, but there are plenty of places to stop to wander around and take pictures. The park limits the size of vehicles (no giant RVs on many of the roads), so I suspect that is why there are so many fewer tourists here. Plan at least a day to see these amazing giants of nature! Get your annual park pass for all of the national parks, and save big $$$ on the entrance fees at national parks nationwide...","April 11, 2018",Awesome,336,"Federal Way, Washington",5
Sequoia National Park,"In April, there was snow to see (in banks), but had dry roads. 1 or 2 side roads were closed still for the winter season. I have seen the redwoods in N. CA, those were more spectacular. I wouldn't fly across the country to see this park alone. But it is 4.5 hours from Death Valley so I made it a weekend to see both. That was perfect and I suggest that to anyone. The gift shops, visitors centers and employees all were welcoming. I had a a rental sedan, but much of this park has narrow roads and is not friendly if driving a rig over 22 ft. If you are towing or in a RV - research beforehand. ","April 11, 2018",Worth the trip!

As soon as we drove through you could start to see all the huge sequoia trees. Just the magnitude of their size is incredible. We then reached the point where the largest tree on earth stands.. the general sherman.

We literally ascending to the highest point before descent and then were told had to turn around and leave without a refund; let alone 4 and a half hours round trip.

These trees are thousands of years old and belong to the largest living organisms on Earth. Among them you will find the largest known living single stem tree in the world - the General Sherman. It is not easy to get there, but it is very difficult to leave. Forget about uber, bike or public transportation but when you finally reach your destination, unforgettable memories will stay with you for a lifetime. It's hard to describe it in words, but you know it when you see it. I could watch those trees all day. It is worth mentioning that the ranger standing nearby the General Sherman was very knowledgeable with a great sense of humor.

In my visit to this park I was not only thrilled and awed at the beauty of the natural surroundings, but reminded that there are things more important than 'stuff' or entertainment. To be in this setting - amongst gigantic trees, many of which are over 2,000 years old, is nothing short of breathtaking. The park is surprisingly well maintained and staffed by cheery, helpful stewards. This is a must for everyone. Perhaps if more people would visit this park, we would have a better world overall.","December 20, 2017",This is a place that every human being should visit,34,NYC,5

The road going through the park to the area of trees from the south is very windy and we were lucky that in the latter part of October there weren't RVs, but still plenty of cars. Walking around the trees was a wonderful experience--it seemed that each one or group of them was exceptional, including the largest one, the General Grant tree.","December 2, 2017","Wonderful Huge, Ancient Trees!",40,"Seattle, Washington",5

About 45 minuets from the parkStayed in the Comfort Suites near the Main Street area. Nice shopping, restaurants.As for SequoiaThe approach, the visit, the departure all breathtaking.I took my 12 year old city kid son, who in response to his question as to 'where' we were going I explained that we were going to visit the 'Oldest living organism on Earth. His response . . Why?Well, upon approaching the Sequoias, amidst the unbelievable grandeur . . .The look on his face accompanied by gaping mouth and the absolute absence of any adolescent cynicism or diminishing commentary or sound of any kind was beyond priceless! lol!We traveled to Yosemite the next day, yet this park remains my favorite.

Sequoia National Park,"It's a LONG winding drive from the park entrance to the visitors center but the views will take your mind off of it. You wouldn't think it would be so mountainous but it's really just stunning. And that's before you see your first Sequoia. All you can do is look at it with your mouth hanging open. They are so big it's just mind boggling. And to see a grove of them just renders you speechless. We hiked down a path to see the General Sherman. If you plan to take pix in front of him, don't be in a hurry. There was a line waiting to do it. If you aren't in the best shape, you can walk down the trail, see Gen Sherman and then walk a little to the handicap parking area and wait for the fittest of your group to make that climb back up to where you parked the car. There are benches and bathrooms right there so made it nice. After checking out the giants, we drove to Moro Rock. Holy Crap!!!! That thing is huge. It's supposedly only 300 steps but I think that's a flat out lie. My husband said we didn't have to go to the top but I told him it was idea so I wasn't bailing. There are bathrooms (porta potties) before you start the climb and some informational bulletin boards. luckily there are railings for most of the climb. I'd gone maybe 10 steps and had to stop and get my breath. I'm not a fitness nut but I do 5K's on the elliptical 4 days a week so didn't understand how I could be in such bad shape. Husband reminded me about the altitude so I'm, going with that as to the reason I had to take more than a couple of breaks. There are plenty of places where you can step aside to let people in better shape go ahead of you and for people coming down to get around you. By the time you get up there, it will be worth it though. You can see forever and the wind will def cool you off. There are railings around the perimeter at the top of the rock with signs to not climb over but of course there were idiots that did so that they could get cool pix. My heart just seized when I saw them but what can you do since we were all adults? We were actually above where eagles nest..I swear 1 came within inches of my husbands head.","October 11, 2017",Put a visit to this park on your bucket list,2,"Sylvester, Georgia",5

Sequoia National Park,"Visiting Sequoia is a once in a lifetime experience. These trees are so spectacular that words and pictures can't describe them. They must be seen. Don't miss the Giant Forest Museum and the walking trails around it. The General Sherman tree is a must see, but beware, the tree is located about 220 feet below the level of the parking lot. Going down is easy, but it's a tough climb up (7000ft elev.), so consider your age and physical condition. My wife couldn't make it, so I returned to the car and drove to the handicapped parking at the bottom of the hill to pick her up. If you use the south entrance expect delays for road construction. The road from the south is very steep and winding.Be careful.","October 5, 2017",Drive carefully and plan to do some walking,20,north carolina,5
Sequoia National Park,"This place was awesome! If you like nature then this is the place to be. We got up early and entered the park by 8am. We decided after looking at a map to start at the further point of interest for ourselves (General Sherman Tree) and work our way back looking at the big tree trail, tunnel log, and ending at Moro Rock for sunset. This plan was great. It took about 50 min to get to General Sherman Tree which put us around 9am. We ended up beating most everyone there and had plenty of parking to choose from. I also recommend going early because it adds to the peacefulness of the forest. We walked around and walked the Congress Trail before too many people started showing up. There was plenty of time in the day to do at least 3-5 trails and go see the sunset at Moro Rock. If you can, bring a cooler to leave in your car with sandwiches and snacks. We loved it!","October 3, 2017",Absolutely Beautiful!,7,"Cleveland, Ohio",5
Sequoia National Park,"You can hear about these trees and see pictures, but nothing equals standing among them. They are beautiful trees and just so darned big! We had a beautiful day when we went. Not real crowded. I didn't get to see the Sherman tree, which is supposed to be the largest in the world, because of the pathway to it. I have severe arthritis so I stayed at the trailhead where there were tihngs to read and benches to sit on while my husband and son walked down to it. About 95% of the people coming back up the trail were panting and said the walk back up is very difficult and my husband said I wouldn't have been able to do it. I did find out later that there's a shuttle that takes you to a parking lot near the Sherman tree. No one knew where to get this shuttle or if it was even running after Labor Day. - My husband said the tree wasn't that much bigger than all the others, it's just that it's the largest in the world. Anyway, everyone should see these trees at least once. It was very peaceful and the age and size of them puts life into perspective. Some of them are 3,000 years old!","October 1, 2017",Spectacular!,28,"Elburn, Illinois",5

The road is narrow and extremely winding up the sides of the mountains, but the views of the High Sierras, and the fantastic sequoia forest is worth it for sure.

The views were awesome and the mountains were beautiful. Finally when we reached the park and saw the Sequoias and the red woods.....they was awe inspiring ......hugs creations of nature soaring up into the sky....General Sherman, the Grant grove and General Grant had to be seen. we were hoping to see bears, but made do with the squirrels, and moose and smaller animals which scurried around in the forest.
