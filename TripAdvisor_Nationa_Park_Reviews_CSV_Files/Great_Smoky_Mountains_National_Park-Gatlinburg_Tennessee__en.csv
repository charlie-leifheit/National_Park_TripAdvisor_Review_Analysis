Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"Honesty can't understand why people rate it low and say it was too crowded. If a place is popular, it is going to be crowded. If you don't like crowds stay home. My visit list October of this year, but I live here. There is so much to see. If you want less crowded trails, go to Cosby campground. lots of good trails there. Or Greenbriar picnic area, has good trails","October 18, 2019",One of the best National Parks in the US.,18,"Cosby, Tennessee",5
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"We had so looked forward to driving the Cades Cove loop. Never had we seen it so crowded. We expected delay's but nothing like we ran into this trip.Normally we would expect the 11 miles to take about 2 hours. It was a 3+ hour trip & many things we didn't get to see. Like the old Mill. We circled several times & people parked in the bus/RV parking or on the grass. We finally gave up & left the mill.There were also people who ignored the signs of pulling off to look & would stop in the middle of the road for several minutes at a time.At one point, it took 45 minutes to go 3 miles b/c of one family.As much as I love this area, I'd have to rethink going back & the time of year to travel.","October 18, 2019","If you want to see things, don't travel in October!",69,"Muldrow, Oklahoma",2
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,You're certain to see a black bear when traveling to this national park. We saw 3 on this trip. Cade's Cove is almost a sure thing.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,Park staff could have alerted visitors when there was no where to park at Clingman’s Dome. Instead an hour was wasted heading up the long road only to discover an absolute parking nightmare. Otherwise the visit was fairly pleasant as the leaves were turning color. We also walked the Sugarlands Valley Nature Trail and that was fun and easy to do.,"October 16, 2019",Could Have Been Better,14,"Belvidere, Illinois",3
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"We were there just as the color was beginning. It was still lovely. We came by a number of scenic outlooks that were really worth using. Great views. At the dome there were so many tourists there was a LONG line waiting for a chance to park. The trail up to the dome was full too. I guess it's tremendous that so many like to go to their national parks. If you have a choice, take an all wheel drive car with an engine with some pep. The drive can be challenging for a small 4 cylinder (such as we had).","October 15, 2019",Spectacular views. Very busy. Be prepared to wait for a parking spot at key tourist spots.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"On our way to Pigeon Forge, TN we decided to take the scenic route thru Cherokee, NC and into the Great Smokey Mountain National Forrest. We had just entered the National Forrest when I spotted a young Elk Bull over in a field. We pulled over and got as close as we could for a picture. During this time several other mature bulls came out including a six by six with a cow and it's calf. The large bull chased off the younger bull which came within 6 feet of my wife and I. I was amazed as Elk had disappeared from the smokey mountains and the east coast in the mid 1800's. With the reintroduction of wild elk, the population is growing. Your best chance to see the elk is on the South Eastern part of the park. As we continued thru the park, we saw more wild elk, geese, and turkeys. My wife and I spent several hours enjoying the park and all its beauty. The creeks, streams, small waterfalls, changing leaves and an over abundance of natural beauty was overwhelming. I could only imagine how it would have looked before it was spoiled by mankind and so called ""progress"". This is a place of solitude where one can go and meditate in peace while walking trails or just spending time with God. We agreed that even though we spent a week in Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg, the Great Smokey Mountain National park was our favorite part of the whole trip. It is a must for nature lovers and for anyone who just enjoys the outdoors.","October 13, 2019",Nature the way God intended.,106,"Charleston, South Carolina",5

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"On our way home from South Carolina we changed routes from a planned stop to Graceland in Memphis after we kept seeing friends posting pix from the Smoky Mountains. We were all heading back from a boot camp graduation at Fort Jackson and the mountain pictures were so gorgeous! As we walked the half mile trail that was pretty steep we took a few breaks and then finally got to the cement spiral walkway to the round platform that put you over the treetops with miles of views into several states! It was all worth the huffing and puffing up the trail! As we walked down, we took big breaths and could smell the evergreens that were projecting up and alongside some of the walkway. It actually smelled like a Christmas tree lot! If we go back to Gatlinburg in the future, we will definitely spend most of our time exploring sites in the mountains!

For less congested options we hiked segments of the Applachian Trail, Kephart Prong Trail, Little River Trail, Cucumber Gap Trail and Jakes Creek Trail. The trails were scenic, with lots of streams to pause at. The hikes are listed as moderate, but be aware there are patches of the trail that are steep, rocky, and lots of tree roots in the pathway not to mention streams to cross via stepping stones--- still all worthwhile!","September 30, 2019",Disturbed and Undisturbed options,1,"Austin, Texas, United States",5

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"We have been to this park in the past, but never felt like the crowds were amusement park levels like they were sept. 21-24, 2019. We had to really work hard to find a hike that didn’t have hundreds of people on the trail. The finale of our trip included a hike to Mt. Leconte via the Alum Cave trail. Again, lots of people, but not as bad as other easier hikes. We stayed at the Mt. Leconte lodge and had a great experience. I recommend it if you can get a reservation (lottery system and an ounce of luck). I don’t mean to sound like we don’t love this park, I’m just suggesting that you plan a little like you would a Disney or Yellowstone trip (off season, weekdays) because this park has really seen a leap in attendance and their parking lots haven’t caught up with it. There is a lot of off road parking which leads to a lot of pedestrians without sidewalks on winding, hilly roads.","September 24, 2019","Beautiful hikes, just too many people",1,"Cleveland, Ohio",4

We did all this and never paid a dime like some parks. Free, fabulous and natural! Can't wait to go on more adventures there.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"The scenery is stunning, and there are endless options for trails to hike along to suit all abilities. The higher altitude trails are surprisingly cooler and lower in humidity, so can be a more comfortable in the Summer months, but all of the trails we did have good tree cover so you are hiking in shade. If you don't fancy hiking, even a drive through the park provides some stunning views and great photo opportunities - just don't expect to get anywhere quickly - there are little or no overtaking opportunities, and traffic drives slowly - but why would you want to do anything else - just soak up the scenery.Opinions vary about where to stay - we picked Gatlinburg but deliberately chose a hotel right at the park entrance which we thought gave us the best of both worlds - didn't have to deal with the crowds or traffic in town (not that they were bad anyway), had immediate access into the park, but still plenty to do in the evenings (the better restaurants are also at this end of town). We didn't venture to Pigeon Forge as it sounds much more kid centred & tacky from other reviews - we did look at Townsend and whilst it's lovely with good access to some of the park attractions, there wasn't really much to do in the evenings, so probably good for a mainly self catering family stay, but not what we were looking for.Overall, very glad we picked Gatlinburg.

We saw a different set of black bears every single day we were in the park. We’ve taken a cruise and rented a condo by the beach, but this is easily the best vacation we’ve ever taken, my son and wife agreed. Multiple times in the trip we’ve stayed that this the most beautiful thing we’ve ever personally seen, only to have it surpassed or equaled by something the next day. We swam in a mountain steam, hiked to an impressive waterfall and observed multiple mamma bears complete with sets of cubs.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"The Smokies are a must see for any travelers as they connect to the Appalachians for those to conquer one of the oldest mountain ranges. Great service in the sugarlands visitor center as park rangers help guide you through the areas of the smokies. The smokies actually have 3 more visitor centers due to its large size as a national park. Porters creek is an amazing hike of walking up a trail while seeing a river. Clingmans dome is a must-do as its the most traveled place in the smokies. (I also saw someone get married on Clingmans dome ). Porters creek also houses an old burial site along the trail. At the end of the trail you encounter barns, stables and houses made in the 1800's. If your staying in a log cabin your best bet of civilization near-by is Gatlinburg. Gatlinburg is actually at the tip of the park and houses many attractions. Nearby to is the Indian reservation of Cherokee home to the eastern band of Cherokee. The Alum Cave trail is one of the hardest in the smokies but worth the hike. Alum Cave trail leads to mount. Le Conte (about 1.2 miles). All at best i rate this national park 5 stars for good service and managed trails.","July 23, 2019",Only you can prevent fires,2,"Canton, Georgia",5

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"During our 3 day visit to the area and while in GSMNP we visited Cades Cove, Clingmans Dome, hiked the Lynn Camp Prong Cascades (on way from Cades Cove to Clingman's Dome) and drove the Roaring Fork Nature Trail (saw a momma black bear and cub at this location). The park can be busy but there were plenty of stops to park, hike, take pictures. I specifically mention Lynn Camp Prong Cascades as it is a shorter hike (say 1/2 miles but you can view the first cascade after .4 miles) and it was a very accessible hike on an old logging road (our 11 year old has mild cerebral palsy which impacts her right foot/leg/hand/arm and this can make longer, narrow, rocky hikes something she cannot participate in.) It was so nice to see her smile as she was able to climb around in the creek etc. We hope to return to the park some day, fall has to be amazing there! Some tips would be to pack a picnic lunch when visiting to maximize time in the park. Also a visitor might consider taking water shoes, wearing swimsuits under other clothes as playing in the creeks and streams was pretty common in the park.","July 22, 2019",Breathtaking Views!

Both were great, easy flat hikes (or maybe more nature walks) along water so there were places for the dogs to dip in the water and cool off.

With this approach, even in the summer, we had peace and quiet on several popular hikes, and were able to spend the afternoon back at our home relaxing. We also tried to stay within a relatively short drive to the Sugarland/Gatlinburg Park Entrance. Day 1: Alum Cave Trail: 2 miles of peaceful walk by the river, and then a steeper climb up to the rocky bluffs. Amazing views along the way.Day 2: Cucumber Loop: Beautiful walk by the river (we saw bears), and then a walk through Rhodendron forests culminating in a walk by old home sites.Day 3: Clingman's Dome: It was cool on top in the morning - bring a sweatshirt and a windbreaker. Following the 0.5 mile up/down from the top, we did the Andrew's Bald Hike from the parking lot. Lots of up and down over uneven terrain (not ideal for kids), but the view from the grassy meadow at the end was worth it.Day 4: No hiking. We were pretty soreDay 5: Cades Cove. We did the Abram's Falls Hike (we had not seen any major falls on our trip). Some ups and downs, but relaxing walk. 5 miles round trip. We got to Cades Cove around 8:00, and there was not much traffic around the loop. We saw Turkeys and deer, but no bears. All in all, a great visit. I think if we visited again, we would spend a few days on the South East corner of the park.","June 29, 2019",A wonderful and Unique National Park,181,"Laurel, Maryland",5

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"I allowed myself a couple days to explore Gatlinburg and the national park before a stint at the Arrowmont Arts and Crafts Center and glad I did. For 2 dollars, the most awesome bargain, you can take the trolley roundtrip to the national park. My tour guide Marge was so informative and since I was the only passenger, answered all my questions and narrated the history and geology and the flora and fauna of the park on a pleasant ride to the Sugarlands Visitor Center, the Laurel Falls trailhead and the Elkmont camping grounds. I got off at the Laurel Falls trailhead to hike to the falls and returned an hour and a half later to my pickup from Marge.","June 27, 2019",Trolley ride from Gatlinburg to the national park is an awesome deal,22,"San Mateo, California, United States",5

We got up to Cades Cove and then stopped on a trail on the way back. By the time we were exiting the park, it took us two hours to get through the line of traffic to get out. I HIGHLY recommend going early and leaving early afternoon. Also go during the week if you can...it is much better on a Wednesday. According to locals, for some reason, everyone leaves Gatlinburg on Tuesdays. Knoxville airport. UGHH... we left on a Tuesday.... AWFUL experience.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,What a fantastic trip! My recommendation would be to stop at the Sugarlands Visitor Center for a park map and any additional information you may desire. Tip: Nature breaks included. The drive to Cades Cove is a winding road with several pull-offs for taking pictures. The scenic 11-mile drive on CadesCove Loop Road affords the opportunity to see wildlife. There are also three churches and several cabins & structures utilized by the early pioneers. The 7-mile road off of Newfound Gap Road to Clingmans Dome is a beautiful stop particularly on a clear day. The half mile trek to the tower is a bit strenuous but well worth the effort. The GSMNP is a must see when visiting the Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg area.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"We spent nine days in the Pigeon Forge area. It is one my favorite places to come. A great place for family with so many things to do. While we might be so taken up with games, shows, attractions, we shouldn't forget the most Natural in the area. The Great Smoky Mountains just has that captive name. I would just love to spend a whole day with my camera at Clingmans Cove. The day we went was a little over cast but the sky was loaded with clouds. Just can't imagine a sunset at this location. We entered from Gatlinburg and it was just a short distance into our trip that the traffic was backed up. Well, we learned in Yellowstone that there were animals crossings that would back up the traffic for maybe miles. All depends how long it takes to cross. Well, here in the Smoky's was a black bear maybe 50 feet from the road that everyone had to stop and get their pictures. I remember the last time we were here the traffic was really heavy. Not so bad this time and it was before school let out. There is no charge to this park. Stop at the information center just out of Gatlinburg and check their gift shop at the same time. Your Park Rangers are your best source for information so I would maybe say, wait until you get there to get your information rather than from the internet. I would just caution people, these animals are wild and will attack under certain conditions. On this stop there was a couple that got out of their car and approached this bear at a distance. I could not see if maybe she had cubs or not.","June 19, 2019",Another of Our Great Treasures,190,"Fredericksburg, Virginia",5
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"This was our first visit and was blown away by the beauty of the area. The main purpose for the trip was to see bears which we did. I feel Cade's Cove is a little overrated, all we saw there were cars and people. We actually saw bears on the Grotto Falls drive, which I enjoyed much more than Cade's Cove. We did the hike to Grotto Falls and it was amazing! The research described the hike as an easy 1 mile hike, but their idea of easy and mine are not the same! It was actually 1.4 miles one way and it was a bit arduous. It took us about 2 hours to get to the falls and 45 min to go back down. Bring plenty of water and keep hydrated! The drive around this loop offered many other water falls with easy access, just pull over and jump in! We did this drive 2 other times, we enjoyed it that much. Take your time and enjoy the great outdoors! The weather was great!","June 18, 2019",Beautiful Escape,77,NE Texas,5

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"We spent a week camping in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park and barely scratched the surface!The Park can be crowded, and traffic backups are common, so plan extra time for your visit. A stop at one of the main visitor centers - Sugarlands Visitor Center on the Tennessee side or Oconaluftee Visitor Center on the North Carolina side, is great for getting your maps and brochures, Park merchandise, Junior Ranger booklet, and whatever else you need. Volunteers and rangers are also available to speak with if you looking for some help, and both have nice exhibits worth taking a look at.Visiting some of the popular destinations or hiking on the popular trails are often best done in the early morning before parking becomes a challenge, otherwise bring your patience!Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail and Cades Cove are two popular auto tours. Both offer an abundance of wildlife, historic buildings, hiking trails, and plenty of pullouts to stop and enjoy along the way. We drove both areas a few times and had wonderful visits each time.Clingmans Dome, Newfound Gap, the Mountain Farm Museum, Mingus Mill, and the Noah ""Bud"" Ogle Cabin are other popular destinations that we enjoyed during our visit. There's also several great picnic areas, the only ones we made it to were Chimneys Picnic Area and Cades Cove Picnic Area. Both were great.There are hundreds of miles of hiking trails within the Park ranging in difficulty. Plenty of them are easy enough for most families, just follow basic hiking principles and be bear aware.Most of the roads within the Park offer beautiful scenery and lots of pullouts, so don't just rush to your destination. This really is the place to slow down and connect with nature. Take your time and appreciate the beauty of the mountains, dip your toes into the one (or all!) of the numerous streams, creeks and rivers flowing through the Park. Hike to a waterfall or learn about some of the people that once lived here and how they lived. Look for salamander or stay up late and watch the stars.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"We always love visiting the Smokies. When we go there, the beauty, history and culture are inspiring and rewarding. There are several scenic overviews on the way to Newfound Gap and Cades Cove, with its old cabins and surrounding mountains are breathtaking. However, when we visit, there is always tourist who have stopped and holding up traffic for well over an hour on Cades Cove Road and last time up the highway to Newfound Gap, taking pictures of a bear. Last visit to Cades Cove, we were stopped for over an hour. Two baby cubs were up in a tree. Parents were taking their children out of cars and walking up the road to view these cubs. Another bear was in the field and it was a larger bear. As our car creeped its way up to where the bears were, there was a crowd gathered under the tree and people still hopping out of cars to walk up to see the bears. What an annoyance! I understand the awe in seeing wildlife, but to put children in danger of a mother bear and to be so inconsiderate to hold up traffic is incomprehensible! This is disturbing the wildlife and not respecting park rules. So be prepared to be in traffic at a standstill for long periods of time as people drag their children and leave their cars to run up and take pictures and disturb momma bears and their cubs. I’m surprised this goes on as much as it does. But the Smokies beauty is worth the aggravation of others being inconsiderate.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"This was our first trip to the park. The mountains are beautiful and, as of late May, green and lush. There was still mountain laurel blooming in the woods. Our area of focus was the part of the park that is near the Sugarlands visitor center. We were at the park three days, and did most of the top things to do. We did five of the hikes: Grotto Falls, Laurel Falls, Abrams Falls, Gatlinburg trail, and the little river trail by Elkmont. The first three were moderate hikes, and the last two were easy. For the first three, since we were on a holiday weekend, the park ranger recommended that we get to them by seven or 8 AM, in order to get parking spots and for the hikes to not be too crowded. There are lots of great views, including those from Clingmans Dome and Newfound Gap. My favorite part of the park was the drive from the Sugarlands visitor center to the Cades Cove loop, and the Cades Cove loop itself, with its beautiful scenery and historic buildings.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"There are not enough adjectives in the English language to describe the Smokies. This is the best National Park in the USA and has a little something for everyone. Just a stone's throw from the bustling metropolis (aka Redneck Vegas) of Gatlinburg is the main entrance to the Great Smoky Mountains. There are endless hiking trails, plenty of picnic tables, and non-stop views. You can travel along the main route through the mountains going from the bottom of the mountains to the top and back down again or you can take the meandering road to Cades Cove - the mecca for wildlife. There are other areas of the park that can be accessed from different routes and each offer their own unique vantage point of this vast ecosystem. A list of the Top 5 must dos for every visitor: 1) drive through Cades Cove at sunrise and catch all the wildlife (you're 95% guaranteed to see a black bear in the Spring/Fall) for a special treat go back through just before sunset (but leave plenty of time as it'll take you about 2hrs in the evening); 2) catch sunrise in the park to get those iconic purple mountains (most popular spot is Clingmans Dome); 3) walk around a grist mill or the Oconaluftee mountain farm and then venture into the Oconaluftee Indian Village (Reservation); 4) Roaring Fork Motor Trail (you'll be immersed in history and nature); and 5) take a hike (whether it be an all-day adventure or a quick walk to a waterfall) you'll be happy you did","May 15, 2019",Best National Park in the USA,6,"Frederick, Maryland",5

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is STUNNING. I visited in late March and we lucked out with a beautiful 70 degree day. As with most national parks, I recommend arriving as soon as you can before the crowds rush in. Because it was such a nice day, the park was busy which made parking a challenge. We arrived around 7:00am and enjoyed hiking the Chimney Tops trail without hardly seeing anyone else. It was a fun hike with a rewarding view. After we descended (maybe around 10am or so) the roads were very crowded and had trouble pulling off anywhere to hike or see the sites. We took the scenic loop towards Cades Cove and LOVED the views. That being said, traffic was bumper to bumper and everyone was going about 5 miles an hour. We obviously didn't expect that going into it, so next time I'd plan accordingly. I believe the park has a complimentary shuttle service but it was not available for our visit in March. For anyone visiting in the summer, I'd highly recommend looking into the shuttle service to get around more easily and without having to worry about parking. Plan to spend the entire day here. The sunrises and sunsets over the mountains are a must see.","May 8, 2019",Go Early and Enjoy the Sunrise,58,"Chicago, Illinois",5

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"The title says it all. I honestly am amazed that there are 2 ""Terrible"" reviews for the Great Smoky Mountains. One from a guy who is upset that his dogs are not allowed on trails, evidently not realizing that this rule is in place for the safety of his dog, and himself. The National Park has well over 1,000 bears living there, and having a barking dog is a recipe for disaster. And nobody loves their dogs more than we do, and we take them camping with us in Cades Cove every single year. It is true that dogs are not allowed on the hiking trails, but if his dog were to get away from him and get lost in the wilderness, there is simply not enough manpower to send out people to help find his dog. Its for everyone's own good that this policy is in place, and this is coming from someone who loves to hike, and wish I could take my dogs with me when I do.The Great Smoky Mountains National Park, is a place of natural beauty unlike any that can be found anywhere else in the Southeastern United States.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"Being from the area, I’m constantly asked about this majestic national park. In my opinion, there’s no better place on earth. Yes, the traffic is crazy getting here, but let me tell ya why it’s all worth it: Especially when ya learn about a few less crowded areas; and do some careful planning.  What to see? It’s simply unlimited: and everyone will tell you, that Cade’s Cove is a must see, and Clingman’s Dome as well. Or maybe they’ll suggest Newfound Gap; or on to Cherokee, to visit the NC side of things. And there’d be little to argue. But rather than add to those suggestions; I’ll mention just a few hidden gems, in no particular order.(They’re all so good).... 1)Roaring Fork Motor Trail. It starts at red light #8 in Gatlinburg: follow all the way up past The Hilton Park Vista, stay right and follow signs. You’ll pass many old cabins, 3 or 4 major hiking trails(including Rainbow Falls and Grotto Falls), tons of scenery, guaranteed wildlife, and a beautiful stream that follows the majority of your route. It’ll bring you back out on hwy 321, still in Gatlinburg. And it can be done in as little as 90 mins, or enjoyed thoroughly in less than a 1/2 day. Keep an eye out toward the end for a beautiful cascade of water falling on your left. There’s also a small store on your right as you leave the park, that sells fresh honey, and more. And yes, they provide that much needed public restroom.. And No, that old antique truck of theirs ain’t for sale.... lol 2)The Greenbrier Park Entrance... Follow 321 NE out of Gatlinburg toward Cosby for about 3-4 miles, you’ll see the Greenbrier Campground area on the left. But, turn Right when you see the national park sign across from a small bbq shack. (Yes the bbq is pretty tasty). Man, is there a ton of stuff to do in here.... The little pigeon river flows through here for swimming and kayaking. There’s also a nice quite picnic area for lunch. Now onto the good stuff. The trail to the left will take you to the beautiful Ramsey’s Cascades, which is arguably one of the best falls in the park(though it’ll take 5-8 hrs RT).. It’s one of my all time favorites in the summer, as the ice cold water will make it worth it. Or stay straight ahead to get on the The Porter Creek Trail. There’s a couple of old houses along the hike to a small waterfall: though a much smaller waterfalls, it’s still worth the hike. I’d do this one if time is short. Its only 2-4 hrs total. These parking lots get more crowded as the day goes. Note: the road into Greenbrier is mostly gravel, and gets narrow in places: So if you’re in your Porsche, or Bentley, you can stay in town; as you will get dusty. Lol... Or, since money wouldn’t be a problem, you can seriously rent a Jeep, scrambler, or other all terrain vehicle of your choice, offered at various Gatlinburg rental spots....  3) Alum Cave trail. Yes, this is one that’ll take you all the way up to LeConte Lodge. But, you can shorten this a ton by taking the trail just up to the overhang area at Alum Cave. There’s a pretty creek for the first 3/4 mile, then a natural hole to climb through a rock formation, and then on up the mountain. Take a min to try and spot the falcon’s nest off to the left at a rocky resting spot about 1.8 miles or so in. The overhang makes for a nice resting spot for lunch, before heading back down. This hike will only take about 2-4 hrs round trip. Now, If you’re in it to win it; the Lodge at the top is worth the full 11 mile trek. This will take a majority of your day(7-8 hrs). Note: They do offer a cold sack lunch, and drinks for day hikers at the top; All for a reasonable price. And, be sure to grab a T-shirt for your accomplishment; as they’re not available anywhere else on earth.  4) Cosby Campground. Take 321 into Cosby(25 mins), turn right on Hwy 32 about 2/3 mile to the park entrance on the Right. Follow a beautiful drive along the creek for 2 miles. There’s a picnic area, that’s never full; and also a looped campground(that serves best for tent campers). There’s a ton of hikes in this area, including one with a beautiful waterfall; especially after the rain. Grab a hikers map at any park outlet for in depth details of various day hikes. There’s too many to name here. Note: This is one of the least crowded areas, that is accessible by car. So, it’s worth checking out.  Now the cautions: If hiking, take plenty of water, snacks, a rain jacket, light source, decent shoes or hiking boots, multi tool, or anything else you think ya might need. Please Be prepared.... And please note: pets(dogs,cats, canaries, etc), are not allowed on any park trail unless specified in writing. This is for their safety, and yours. I’ve seen Rangers writing pricey tickets for this over the years. Remember, wildlife is plentiful: and that means a chance of bumping into one of the estimated 1600 Black Bears inside the park: Which also leads to the next tip. If picnicking, keep your food locked up and out of reach. Any and all food, or waste is dangerous if left out. Put everything away after eating, use the metal dumpsters; put out the fires completely, and clean up in full, before partaking in your recreation.  All n all, there’s just too much to try and mention here. There’s no bad place to visit in the park; but some can be more breathtaking than others. Sorry I rattled on, but when traveling, I like as many details as possible myself... One last tip-please Don’t sleep in! I know you’re on vacation, but there’s just too much to see; that you don’t wanna shorten your day. And, the earlier you get started, the less crowded it’ll be. Please come n visit these beautiful mountains, be responsible... and most of all, Have Fun!","April 8, 2019",“It’s only the Very Best....”,792,SEYMOUR,5

Not difficult but give yourself enough time. Second stop was at the 'Swift' where the river crosses under the road and displays wonderful falls and rapids. Many other places to stop along the way as road closely follows the river.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"I recently visited here again with friends and explored new areas of the national park I'd not seen before. If you need some good information about open/closed trails, I recommend stopping by the visitors center to inquire from the park rangers. We stopped by Sugarlands since it was closest to Gatlinburg. (FYI: The Nantahala Outdoor Center keeps an updated whiteboard by the entrance with daily info relative to the trails, including potential bear sightings, etc.)We visited Laurel Falls and Rainbow Falls. Both were beautiful, although the waterfalls are Laurel Falls were more spectacular in my opinion. The views are beautiful from both trails. We also took the dogs for a rountrip hike on the Gatlinburg trail near the park entrance. We hiked another trail up near Clingmans Dome and the views up here are always spectacular, specially around Newfound Gap. We also visited Cades Cove and enjoyed seeing the wild turkeys and deer roaming around. Unfortunately we didn't see any bears this time, although I suppose they were hibernating since it was winter. We spent various days exploring the park and didn't see everything there is to see since the park is huge. I recommend wearing appropriate clothes and bringing proper gear for trail hiking if that's your thing. There are public restrooms at the visitors centers. Be aware that there's really no cell phone service inside the national park, so plan accordingly. I highly recommend visiting the Great Smoky Mountains National Park if you love the outdoors and beautiful mountain scenery.

The only disappointing thing was the graffiti on some of the historic sites. Not cool. Anyhow, we did hike here and there, in particular Rainbow Falls. It's a little bit of an uphill trek getting to the falls if you're capable of moderate level hikes (walking stick/pole is advisable), but worth it. Homesteads were also very lovely, and the one mill we saw was interesting, too!

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"Wonderful, free National Park. Stop at the Sugarlands Visitor Center near Gatlinburg to get maps and learn everything you need to learn. This park has everything and trails are suited for every level as marked on the map. For scenic drives, I would forgo the overly crowded foothills parkway drive and instead opt for the Catalooche Valley drive which is less crowded or the Blue Ridge Parkway which has more scenic vistas than the Foothills Parkway. Cades Cove has become run down and I was disappointed at the lack of upkeep during my last drive through it. Definitely drive up to Newfound Gap and Clingman's Dome and take the walk to the top of Clingman's dome.

I study the hikes or places I want to visit long before I go. I know how hard it may be or how long it could take. The wildlife is everywhere.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"I find it sad that Americans would rate a distillery in Gatlinburg over the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, but there is a reason why it is so famous! I've been wanting to visit for years, but we had the opportunity to go for the first time in December 2018 over Christmas. While many of the hiking trails were closed due to ice and snow, the paved trail up to Laurel Falls was open. The 2.6 mile loop was rated ""moderately difficult"" and not recommended for strollers- however, we were able to push our jogging stroller (City mini GT by babyjogger) up to the waterfalls. Other parents however had to turn around with their stroller so if you do decide to push a stroller 1). make sure you have a good stroller with solid wheels and 2). that the parent pushing the stroller has good upper body strength and is in decent shape. Prior to our hike, we enjoyed the visitors center and museum. The park did not charge admission, but we made a donation and purchased a few items in the gift shop!

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"My family has visited the Great Smoky Mountains National Park many times over the years. We love it and never miss an opportunity to go there whenever we can. On Thanksgiving week we entered the Great Smokey Mountains National Park at the Oconoluftee visitor center in Cherokee NC and traveled the scenic Newfound Gap road (US 441), through the park ending at the Sugarlands visitor center just outside of Gatlinburg Tenn. The Great Smokey Mountains are a beautiful mountain range that reach towering heights of nearly seven-thousand feet, but gets it name from its magical, smoky haze. GSMNP is the most popular National Park in the country hosting ten-million plus annual visitors. It is the only National Park that is FREE. That’s right no admission fee. Located in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee it encompasses over five hundred twenty thousand acres and offers something for everyone; fishing, spectacular views, over 4,000 species of plants and mountain rivers. Enjoy a stress-free afternoon, hiking to a magnificent waterfall or how about the opportunity to see bear, elk and other wildlife in their natural habitat? I recommend you do what we did and spend a day touring Cades Cove or driving the Roaring Fork Motor Trail or the Little River Road (all are Must Do’s). If hiking is your thing, (my family including my four year old Granddaughter love it) there are more than 850 miles of hiking trails that traverse the Great Smoky Mountains. Choose a half hour walk or take a week-long backpacking trip (Backcountry camping requires a permit) by hooking up with the Appalachian Trail that runs for 70 miles along the park’s top ridge. Trails range from mostly flat and easy (Gatlinburg Trail) to very strenuous (Boulevard Trail from Newfound Gap to Mt. LeConte). If you choose to hike, consider spending a night or two at LeConte Lodge (reservations required). The Lodge is situated on an open glade just below the summit of Mt. LeConte (only accessible by hiking ). At an elevation of 6593 feet LeConte Lodge is the highest guest lodge in the eastern United States and offers unparalleled views of the Smokey Mountains (We have stayed there and there is nothing that compares to the experience).

Take every chance you have to explore...take walks! Visit the displays. It is worth it! They have a couple little booklets you can buy that are only $1 I think. They are numbered and tell about each site along the way and are definitely worth it! One bad thing.....is STUPID people!

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"Our visit to the Great Smoky Mountains took place during Thanksgiving break. After doing research on the best trails to venture with kids, we decided on the Laurel Falls Trail. During my research, I specifically looked for trails that were kid friendly, yet somewhat challenging, to make it fun but also adventurous for our group. We traveled with a range of ages, from 3-65 years old. For reference, all of the members in our party were of good health with minimal or no physical impairments. Our first stop was the Sugarland Visitors Center, where we got a chance to learn about the different hiking options and also visit their small but cute museum, which highlighted a lot of the wildlife that you may encounter. The center was helpful in serving as a central meeting spot for our group, speaking with a park ranger, and also giving everyone a chance to use the restrooms prior to starting our hike. It's very important to note that at this point, cell phone service is minimal, if any, and you should prearrange with members of your party meeting points and times as communication via cell phone will be very limited. Location: To reach the Laurel Falls hike starting point, you simply turn right once you exit from the visitors center, and drive about 3 miles out. You will then hit an area with a lot of parked cars along the side of the road. Park wherever you can find a space, but be mindful that some spots have dips where you car may get stuck in you don't have a high clearance vehicle or 4x4. We saw this happen to several sedans and compact cars. Once parked, simply walk towards the sign that starts the trail.Hike:The actual hike is a little over 2 miles round trip. At the end of the hike, you will encounter a huge waterfall that flows into a creek below. You can take many pictures along the waterfall and you can also climb down towards the bottom of the creek, if you are able to. Although it's listed as ""easy"", it's important to note that this trail is still on a constant uphill climb, and the path, although paved, is rough at many points. Some websites listed this trail as stroller friendly, but in our opinion, it's only ""jogging stroller friendly"", and even so, can still prove to be a bit of a challenge. The main problem is that the pathway is narrow, and adding a stroller minimizes the space for walking for hikers going up and back down. Add to it that this is a highly popular trail so the amount of walking traffic is heavy, and will make the hike with a stroller a bit challenging. Even worse, if you venture with an umbrella type or non- rough terrain stroller, you will find it hard to manuveur across the rough pathway. My suggestion would be to leave the stroller behind. If you are traveling with a toddler or very small infant, it's strongly suggested to bring a carrier, or prepare yourself to carry your child along this path. It's definitely doable, but be aware of this and you will be fine. All the kids in our party enjoyed the hike and our 3 year old was fine taking turns walking and being carried.Along the path, there are several small creeks and lots of great picture spots with the Smoky Mountains as your beautiful backdrop. Total hike time round trip for our party, which included several stops to take pictures, and water breaks, was about 2.5 hours. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed the hike and our kids were excited to see the waterfall at the end. Other Trails:Gatlinburg Trail: Another notable family friend hike was the Gatlinburg Trail, which is more stroller friendly and an easy hike. It isn't as popular as the other trails due to lack of inclines and waterfall but there's still lots of flora and creeks, so it's a nice and easy hike, right at the end of downtown Gatlinburg. Clingsman Dome:If you are more adventurous and don't have small kids in your party, you can opt for the trails at Clingsman Dome, which is steeper and more of a challenge. The view is also breathtaking.","November 26, 2018",Beautiful trails and interaction with nature but choose the trails wisely,228,"Miami, Florida",5

So much to do and see; week is not enough to see enjoy even a fraction from the Gatlinburg side. For first timers, a drive to Clingmans Dome and the short, albeit, moderate steep climb (for those not accustomed to hills) to observation tower is well worth it. The drive along the way is stunning with pull offs for picture taking at regular intervals. Also, make sure to go to Cades Cove as well. Both are great introductions to the Smokies.

We were a little disappointed as the most of the tress haven’t all change color yet because this year the temperature were warmer and it wasn’t cold enough.

At the entrance of the park is Gatlinburg. This town is like Estes Park on steroids. Every tourist trap restaurant, shop, and amusement is all within walking distance from your hotel/motel.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,We really liked our drive through here in October. How gorgeous! And each turn looked a bit different. It was easier to stop at the smaller parking areas without facilities than the other bigger places. We couldn't get into Newfound Gap. The line to get into the parking lot was ridiculous. And it was kind of hard to get out of the visitor's center. At first no one was directing traffic but then staff showed up and helped all the left turners to get out. We would have been there FOREVER otherwise. But nice and how cool that it's all free. Good hiking and river ops.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"We had high hopes for spectacular fall color and mountain landscapes. Mother Nature had other ideas and our 3 days in the park had clouds and rain. We thought we had the timing right per on line recommendations but found out per Park Rangers that the fall color change was about two weeks behind. Well you take what nature provides and appreciate it. We took some pics in the clouds at Clingman’s Dome and admired fall color where it was starting to break out. Two pieces of advice. First, if your main purpose is to enjoy the beauty, sights, and trails of the Smokies then beware of Gatlinburg. You may want to stay somewhere else. The traffic was terrible and the main drag reminds one of a carnival with barkers, cheap tourist junk and midway rides. The other advice is to carefully research your trip timing. It seems that this year and last year fall color arrived 2 weeks later than history would suggest. Our timing this year (2018) was for the last 2 weeks of October. It appears that the last week of October and the first week of November would have been the better choice. There are changes with altitude but that wasn’t much help either this year with our timing. Despite our visit timing the park was spectacular and well worth experiencing. ","October 27, 2018",Mountain Majesty Timing,159,"Bettendorf, Iowa",5

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"I rate this park a 5 star if it weren't so people polluted! We were here for fall colors which were good at elevation, but not so good down at the Gatlinburg elevation (Oct 23 and 24 in park). We stayed near stoplight #8 which is nearer to the park entrance. This was absolutely necessary. The first day we drove to Newfound Gap, Clingmans Dome, and over to Cherokee, NC. We left our hotel a bit before 9 am. The Sugarlands Visitor Center was more crowded that the foyer of a Broadway Show before the doors open! Don't plan to stop to get information other than to pick up available reading material. The place is packed. We enjoyed our drive and were able to stop at all of the overlooks we wanted to and park in the lots. But if we were an hour later, I'm sure parking would have been a problem. The fog layered in the valleys below was spectacular. The next day we traveled to Cades Cove. Knowing it is a crowded area, we left our hotel a little before 8 am. We had a gorgeous day again with fog hanging in places around the cove making for great pictures. We had no trouble stopping or parking where we wanted to stop. The traffic was not bad. It was great timing. Now we considered hiking on one of the popular trails on the way back. NO WAY! The parking areas were over-packed by 11 AM! Now the bad news. The Pigeon Forged bypass and the Gatlinburg Parkway merge to enter the Park. Both were backed up at least 2 miles at 11 AM! Getting into the Park starting late morning is not worth the effort. Only luck would give you a parking spot anywhere. Which means to me that the Park is only Great in the early morning! There was no way we would reenter the Park after Lunch in Gatlinburg! Indeed, if we packed a picknick lunch in our morning entries, we would have found plenty of picnic spots, but no hiking trailheads to park in. So plan your afternoon accordingly.

And the hike to Clingman’s Dome( .5 miles) while paved and mostly inclined felt more like a checkout line or shopping mall walk with all the people on it. The view was breathtaking but very very windy and much cooler then the trail. Bumper to bumper traffic made coming and going a lot longer and harder to see pull offs and trails. No bears this trip. Can’t blame them for hiding from all the traffic. Even the visitor centers were way more crowded then two years ago. And Cade’s cove was bumper to bumper 2 hour wait to get into. Did see some turkeys and deer this trip. ,"October 19, 2018",Beautiful park but,38,"Columbiana, Ohio",3
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"Allow 2 different days for to enjoy each of these. Clingman’s Dome is amazing but be ready for delays due to traffic and parking. The .5 mile walk is paved but uphill along with the high altitude. It can be more strenuous than you might expect. The views are amazing as you travel up and down but the views from the Dome is spectacular! Be prepared for wind and temperatures that may be as much as 10 to 15 degrees cooler than wherever you are staying. Cades Cove is an 11 mile paved path that you can enjoy by vehicle, bicycle or walking. We rented bicycles from the Cades Cove General Store. The bicycles were excellent and the staff was very helpful. There was a lot of walking, riding and coasting by myself and my wife, 65 and 66. It took about 2 1/2 hours including a stop for lunch along the way. Very tiring but glad we went. The cars at times got in the way but overall we are glad we experienced Cades Cove by bicycle!","October 18, 2018",Clingman’s Dome and Cades Cove,5,"Fishers, Indiana",5

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"Here's my take, we came to enjoy nature in all her glory, not for Gatlinburg or Pigeon Forge, in fact we didn't even know how over the top (cheesy) that part was. That being said, we booked a cabin in the mountains nearby, and everything came together just fine. We were near everything we wanted to be. After seeing the ""main"" entrance into the Park at Gatlinburg, back up into Pigeon Forge, we began to look at different entrances. Enter at either Wears Valley or Townsend on the North side if you're near there (we came from Ohio.) Also, if you're flexible at all, if there is anyway to coincide your Park visit after a big rain event, I highly recommend it! We drove through a multi day rain storm, white knuckled all the way, and we were rewarded with magnificent waterfalls and creeks brimming with rapids. It was spectacular beyond anything I ever expected, we felt like we were given a gift. It was gift from The United States to US all the people to enjoy, and enjoy we did. Find the trails to hike that not everyone else is hiking. We found The Middle Prong trail head at Tremont, after a rain storm...you will be amazed!","October 17, 2018",With careful planning you can avoid the crowds!,87,"Columbus, Ohio",5
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"The most visited national park in the US. Just keep this in mind when you plan a visit, try as hard as you can to avoid peak hours and major holidays, it can be real crowded.Main gateways to the park are Gatlinburg to the West, and Cherokee to the East, which lies within the Indian reservation.The park is beautiful in Autumn and in summer provides some relief from the heat. It’s rich with wildlife, although we did not see any bears and this probably lowered my overall judgement.The main reason for the three starts, actually, is that this park is mostly enjoyed by foot, driving through it can be boring and a nightmare in high season, or even in some wildlife is crossing the street. Low speed limits also make your drive painfully slow. Additionally, the best trails are long, and some hard for the untrained, so you’ll have to schedule some days in the park to enjoy the best views. Unfortunately, we only stayed overnight, so we had to limit to the shortest, least interesting trails.We visited Cades Cove and the Nature Trail that starts behind the campground. Cades Cove has some nice views of the meadows, but possibilities to stop and take pictures are limited by the intense traffic. This should be either biked or walked through, but, again, you’ll need more time if you want to do that. The trail also was nothing special, no views at all.Then we drove the Roaring Fork Motor trail, beautiful and just the perfect bear habitat, too bad we saw none. We hiked the short Ogle Place trail, also beautiful and interesting thanks to the mill and cabins.The following day we finally enjoyed the beautiful views of the park: Chimney Tops and Newfound Gap, and the Glingsman Dome, which is environmentally horrible but provides a wonderful, over-the-clouds view of the park. Then we wanted to do the Smokemont Trail, but could not find any parking as the only lot is quite far from the trailhead, also located within a campground. We had to make do with a partial walk of the Oconaluftee River Trail, which goes from the Visitor center to Cherokee and has some nice views of the river and meadows.To sum up my review, this is a beautiful park, but you need to have plenty of time to do the walking trail, otherwise it’s very boring.","October 16, 2018",Needs some days to be explored,430,"Parabiago, Italy",3
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"This trip, we set out to get to Clingman's Dome, which is actually a bit south of Gatlinburg on into North Carolina. It is the highest point in the Smokeys and is topped by a tower. The walk up the mountain consists of a half-mile trek along a paved path. There are benches along the way, but as I have ""complained"" about trails in Tennessee, there are no distance markers along the path to allow you to know your progress. This might discourage some from making the climb because it seems to go on and on and on...But, if you make it to the top, and then climb the spiral path to the top of the tower, you do get a spectacular view. The area at the top of the tower is partially covered and there are signs with information of what the viewer is seeing at different points around the rim of the tower. This viewing area is a bit tight though, so if lots of people survive the same trip you did, expect to be in contact with them. But, it was worth it in my mind.","October 16, 2018",A visit to a different area of the park,40,"Maysville, Kentucky",4

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"We drove through Cades Cove, hiked up to Abrams Falls. Drove Newfound Gap Road to Clingman's Dome. We were unable to see much from the Observatory at Clingman's Dome due to the fog that morning. It was a little foggy going up but extremely foggy at the higher altitude. It lifted as we drove down and hiked Chimney Tops trail, which was fun but strenuous. We also drove through Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail and hiked Rainbow Falls Trailhead and Waterfalls. There was also a lovely store at the end of the RFMNT called Ely Mills. The entire trip was exceptional with immense forests and beautiful and unique scenery. The National Park Service has preserved and maintained or rebuilt some of the original historic structures and farmsteads.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"I can’t imagine the Great Smoky Mountains not being the #1 thing to do in Gatlinburg. As others have said there are trails for a variety of ages/abilities. If your not up for a hike, then take a scenic drive thru the park from Gatlinburg to the opposite end near Cherokee. You can pull over in numerous places to enjoy the scenery or stop for a picnic. Fall is my (and many others) favorite season but if you leave early enough the road isn’t busy yet. You wouldn’t want to rush this drive anyhow! Typical speed limit ranges from 35-45 and less on curved roads. From town of Gatlinburg to other end (town of Cherokee) is approximately 1 hour if not stopping. You will typically see herds of elk at the visitor center near Cherokee. Worth noting, I’m personally not a big fan of the highly rated Clingmans Dome. It’s a pretty view from the higher elevation vicinity but I don’t see the appeal to hike to the top of the dome. It’s a difficult, steep hike to the top, and it’s a man made structure so feels unnatural/unattractive in the park. I see most beautiful views around other natural overlooks in the park. Every year I swear I’m not doing Clingmans Dome again! Alum Cave Trail is very interesting as well as other less traveled/busy trails. For me the town of Gatlinburg is touristy and worth about 1-2 hours of time. I guess it depends on what you enjoy! ","October 13, 2018",Should be #1 in Gatlinburg ,51,"Huntsville, Alabama",5
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"It was our first time in the mountains and it was nothing short of amazing. We went on the Cade’s Cove scenic drive and ended with a hike to Abrahm’s Falls. The hike wasn’t too difficult but it has a lot of long areas with jagged and slick rocks. We aren’t “hikers” by any means and didn’t really know what to expect but ended up lapping several groups of people that we saw leaving on our way in. The falls were gorgeous and we were fortunate enough to enjoy them by ourselves for about 15 minutes before anyone else arrived. After we made it out we wanted to try to make it to Clingman’s Dome by sunset. We didn’t make it, but we’re instead were met with the most INTENSE and TERRIFYING fog I’ve ever endured!!! A lot of other drivers were parked at the top and we got out to look. We saw the haunting and dark mountains, vast and mysterious...wish we would’ve caught the sunset but it was still wild! Beautiful to say the least.","October 13, 2018",Hauntingly beautiful,3,,5

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"We have been to many National Parks and this is one of our favorites. There is so much to see and do. Many trails for hiking and biking plus miles of roads to drive. Make sure to stop at the tourists centers, they can provide a lot of information plus answer all your questions and their restrooms are always clean. Some of the hiking trails are easy and some are difficult. The views and scenery are magnificent. If it is a clear day head to Clingmans Dome, the 360 degree views are incredible. The hike is only 1/2 mile but you also hike a rise of 300'. That may not sound like much but it is. There are plenty of benches to rest along the way. When you finally reach the top there is an observation deck you need to walk up to see this view. All in all it is worth it. ","October 11, 2018",Truly Beautiful,26,"Pitman, New Jersey",5
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"We took this drive from Gatlinburg to Cherokee on Saturday for a day of it, stopping at overlooks as we went. Views were beautiful and the tops of the mountains did already have some fall color. On our way back toward Gatlinburg that afternoon, traffic suddenly stopped near the Oconaluftee Visitor Center. When we got closer we found the reason. The entire grassy field by the center was FULL of Elk. It was beautiful and to hear their call to awesome and an unexpected treat. We pulled in a parked just to watch them and stayed so late they began to lay down in the field for the evening. Absolutely beautiful as is the views from this area. Do the drive. I was thankful we chose this instead of the shops on this day.","October 11, 2018",Love this drive from Gatlinburg over to Cherokee,34,Statesville,5
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"We did some extensive hiking through the Smokies for the first time. A lot of great hikes for all levels of hikers. The National Parks Dept. does a great job of keeping the trails in good shape. It does tend to get crowded and many drivers on the limited roads through the park, tend to want to stop for any sighting of a bear or nice view. The park has many signs & pull offs encouraging people to pull over to let others by, but this is not always the case, which makes for traffic jams at various times. My suggestion to serious hikers is to get to the park before 8 am, so as to assure yourself a parking spot and less traffic on the roads & trails, especially the more popular hikes.","October 11, 2018",A special place,66,"Hartford, Connecticut",5

We always visit the park to get away from the hustle and bustle of crowed Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. We usually drive through the park and find some kind of hiking trail to hike on. Driving the park is very relaxing. The cool mountain air is refreshing on hot summer days. Whether it is driving to Cades Cove or Clingman's Dome or driving to Cherokee it just plain wonderful. You can pull over many places for a quiet walk in the woods. Many walks are marked with signs. Several pull overs to enjoy the wonderful scenery.

This year we chose some of the less intense trails that are not as frequented by visitors and again the things you see and the people you meet while hiking the trails are always inspiring. We hiked Porters Creek, Kephart Prong, and part of Cove Mountain, starting at Sugarlands. All three had something to offer if you know what to look for while hiking these trails.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"You understand why Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the MOST VISITED National Park when you it's great diversity. From Cade's Cove on the western end to Roaring Fork Motor Trail right outside of Downtown Gatlinburg - there is so much to see and do in one park.To me, the NC side offers a bit more to see and hike than the TN side; but I guess that too depends on what you're wanting to see and do. Cade's Cove is a MUST SEE and DO on the TN side; while Clingman's Done, Newfoundland Gap, and the Elk of the Cherokee Visitor Center on the NC side offer much to see and do.If you want to see a good flowing river (both sides - Pigeon on TN side and Oconaluftee on NC side) or waterfalls - you have to come right after some good rains. Otherwise, they all flow fairly low and not quite as dramatic as when after a good rain.We encountered rain and lots of clouds ( smoke as it;s known in the Smoky's) at Clingman's Dome, but not much elsewhere. You could not even see out over the range of mountains from the parking lot at CD - it was that socked in. Back towards 411, it was clear. Weather is always changing in the Smoky's; so it provides some great photo ops as well.Roaring Fork Motor Trail seems to be a hidden gem just on the outskirts of Gatlinburg, but actually part of the park. The one lane ""trail"" is pretty narrow and sometimes a bit sketchy if not paying full attention by the driver as you go along. Lots of streams and woods. Several hiking trails, yet some are closed due to work during the week, but not on weekends to the couple of falls known off of it. It's approx 10 miles at about 10 miles an hour, so make sure you plan your time and you have to make plenty of stops for photo's or just look at all that is around you.My highlight of the RFMT was seeing a small black bear crossing a creek. I had stopped to just shoot some creek / small waterfall photo's and happened to look downstream past the bridge over the creek and saw the bear crossing. Got one photo before he scampered up into the brush. Jumped in my car and headed down the trail to about where he had crossed into and saw him / her in the bushes - but no clear photo shot. As I approached he / she heard the car and turned around and went back the way it came. With the trail as narrow and curvy as it is - no way to really back up to the bridge crossing to try and see it again. There are also some old log buildings in different areas that you can walk around in, as well as one that has a waterwheel on it. Right as you exit is Ely's Mill, which would be totally interesting for kids and adults to stop and look at all the old building and items (trucks and such) outside.","September 2, 2018",Why come to Gatlinburg and not see the Park,62,"Franklin, North Carolina",5

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"Several things surprised me about our visit - 1- there was no charge to visit this National Park - 2- the AT goes right through it - we walked the 7.9 mile trail to the top of Clingman's Dome and it was challenging - but there was nothing of note along the way- no cool rocks or anything - just steep trails. The Alum Cave trail was unknown to us - we used the word ""WOW"" when we got to the cave area. We didn't know to keep going to the top of Mt LaConte - and we had already planned to do the AT the same day. Some bathrooms are good, some are gross. We received a tip from a local at Rip Roaring raft adventures to make sure to visit Cataloochee - which requires a treacherous drive on a very narrow road along side the mountains with steep drop offs - the reward was to see a herd of elk along with hearing the musical below of the bull elk. We did see a bear on the road leading to Clingman's Dome and were further surprised by how many wild turkeys we saw all over the park.

Seems longer than 1.2 miles but so worth it once you see the falls and touch the water. We also saw a bear along the trail. there are rangers too to check on things and walk along the trail I believe. The path is mainly paved. Take water and pace yourself, We went to clingmans dome but it was cloudy rainey and dreary--so we did not make it there all the way up. I would say just from those we spoke with you have to pace yourself and take your time and sit when needed, If the weather were better we would have tried to go all the way.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"We love the Smoky Mountains and have hiked may of the trails over the years. If you have young children, pick a destination trail...one that ends in a waterfall. You need to understand that one mile on a trail is much more challenging than a mile on a sidewalk. Dress appropriately, pack plenty of water; and also pack an easy, light lunch or snack...something that has both protein and carb...we like peanut butter on mini bagels. We avoid the trails that everyone else does...they're too crowded. One of our favorite is Baskins Creek Falls...on this trip, we had the waterfall all to ourselves...just amazing. Don't give in to the temptation to carry your children...keep at their pace and let them feel a sense of accomplishment and pride from having actually done the whole trek themselves! When our son was just five, he fell and injured his knee and it would have been easy to just pick him up and carry him, but we didn't...though he tried to get us to carry him, we didn't give in.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"So a few weeks ago we got married in Getlinburg on top ofA mountain, then for our mini moon we did a few weekend hikes that I have to say where pretty challenging! We love hard hikes and we are from NC and wanted to see what y’all have here in the smokies! The top 2 hikes (for those who Crave uphill) were the Chimneys and the next day (you will need the entire day about 8 hours plus) we did the Trillium Gap trail (get there early we had to park almost exactly 2 miles away from the trail head on top of our 15 miles). This leads you to grotto falls (aka people soup in the day time) then right after you are home free ... no your only free of all the crowds .... from there you can actually enjoy one of the most beautiful hikes and challenging hikes we’ve done (we may have been a little sore from the chimney tops and the other hikes but we are super active and thought it was a great challenge!) and you can go all the way up to Mount Le Conte and see the primitive lodging (bring $ if you do t bring enough food and water the food smells delicious and you will be hungry) but don’t stop there go up to the cliffs and get the 3rd highest and unbelievably beautiful views!

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"Cades Cove is one of the most popular spots and a great place to see wildlife, especially in the evening, but also very crowded. It is an 11-mile one-way loop, traffic is bumper to bumper and despite frequent signs ""be courteous, don't stop"" no one is being courteous and everyone is stopping. It took me about 1 hour to get to Cable Mill Visitor Center which is half way around the loop and worth a stop, you get to see some historic buildings including a water mill. Appropriate shoes or boots required on a rainy day, it gets very muddy.Taking the Newfound Gap Road from Sugarlands to Oconaluftee Visitor Center and then the Blue Ridge Parkway to Soco Gap is a great way to see the park and take in some scenic views without leaving the car. If you have more time and better weather conditions, there are also plenty of hiking opportunities along the road. I had been planning on hiking a section of the Appalachian trail to Charlies Bunion but ended up not doing it because of the rain. Soco Falls are right next to the road and worth a stop, parking is limited but that was no problem, not sure how it would have been on a sunny day though.Sugarlands Visitor Center is showing an interesting 20 min movie about the park and at Oconaluftee there is a museum featuring historic farm buildings, admission is free.

While I enjoyed the hiking and the views, there were way too many people trying to hike some of the trails. For one of the waterfall hikes, we had to park well beyond the trail head. I can say I have been here but I won't go back. Way to touristy for me.","July 25, 2018",Beautiful,31,"Houston, Texas",4

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"I'm a National Park aficionado and had my senior park pass packed and ready. Much to my surprise and delight, there are no entrance fees into the park! That alone makes it a perfect destination for families. We lucked out with great weather, lots of wildlife and fantastic views--I can only imagine what it looks like in the fall with autumn colors. The park itself is gorgeous but crowded in the afternoons. I advise hitting the popular spots early (Clingman's Dome, Cades Cove) before the afternoon crowds descend. Roads throughout the park are limited so be prepared for stop-and-go traffic in some areas. I hadn't realized that the Appalachian Trail bisects the park and portions can be easily hiked (with bragging rights). We did hike to Grotto Falls, which was steep with lots of trees roots, and not suitable for young children. We also drove through the Fork Motor Nature Trail after savoring a picnic lunch near Sugarlands Visitor Center. I would have enjoyed spending another day or so hiking to more waterfalls but two days gave us an excellent introduction to this beautiful park.","July 25, 2018",No entrance fee!,9,,5
Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"This park was amazing and easy for both normal active people and people with mobility issues alike to see and appreciate the many vistas, wildlife, and hiking. We went in July a very busy month. The key to this is get up early and venture out! Early means when the sun comes up. If you wait until 7 or 8AM to leave your cabin or campsite you will struggle to find adequate parking unless you have an SUV or all-terrain vehicle during the busy season. Other than that, the park is beautiful and there are plenty of pull off areas to capture those epic camera shots.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"I mean seriously … isn't this why you come to this wonderful area. A beautiful National Park that is free to explore, enjoy, and be totally thrilled with. We visited the Sugarlands Visitors Center (take the time to watch the video) and explored the Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail one day. We hiked to the Grotto Falls. This is a 'moderate' hike, but it was all uphill (yes I know I am on a mountain), and a ton of tree roots on the paths. This is very cool, but can make things a bit more slow going. I wish I could say the hike to the falls was worth it, and they are really pretty, BUT the screaming children in the water hole at the bottom of the falls really kind-of ruined the mood. But, it was good exercise, and a nice walk. We also went on the Cades Cove Loop. We stopped at a few of the houses, buildings, and churches. I especially enjoyed walking thru the cemeteries to see the old headstones. We did not tour all the way to end, but took Rich Mountain Road out of the park, It is a non-paved road that winds up and down the mountain and comes out in Townsend. We were able to see two open views which were nice, but the best view --- we saw five bear in total. We came upon a Mama Bear and three cubs and they were near the road, peeking around the tree at us. She let us snap a few pictures and ooh and aah and then she moved them further into the woods.

We did hike a bit of the Appalachian Trail once we reached the top.We did drive through Cade's Cove hoping to see wildlife. We only saw one deer. On the drive back to Gatlinburg, we did get to see 3 baby bears cross the road. I enjoyed the history at Cade's Cove. We walked through the old houses, churches and graveyards. There were some beautiful views from the Cove as well.

We probably would have still hiked the 1/2 mile up hill to see the viewing station, but it was disappointing. The hike to Alum Cave Bluffs was a moderate hike - just don't be fooled, there is no cave there. Very beautiful waterfalls along the way - the bluffs are interesting, but not quite as exciting as the NP staff member made them sound - the hike itself was worth it though.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"My wife and I went with another couple and rented a cabin facing the mountains. The view was awesome from our cabin porch and windows. Often we would just go outside and watch the mountain interact with the clouds. The cabin was far enough away from the crowds and close enough to go to town and meet the crowds. We went during the 4th of July week when it was very hot( high 80's to low 90's). It was great to go into the mountains at this time because the higher you go the less humid and hot you felt. A hot/humid 90 degree day might feel like a breezy/no humidity 75 degree day in the mountains. If you take the road up to Newfoundland Gap there are some great views and a bit of history you can read. You can even pretend to be hiking the Appalachian Trail since it runs right through the site. We also visited Klingerman's Dome which is the highest point of the Smoky Mountains. If you want to hike up to the observatory it has awesome 360 degree views. WARNING! The half mile hike is not for the weak. It does have an asphalt path but it is pretty much a HARD upward climb. You cannot send a wheelchair up this ramp...the path is way too steep. Even with that warning...many older and less fit hikers do go up, but take many stops at the large stones or benches that are found along the way. Many hikers coming back down tend to encourage those going up to take breaks but that the view would be worth it. They were right. I might also encourage you to take the trip up the mountain early in the morning. We went up around 10 am and it was not too crowded. By the time we left the dome there were NO parking spots to be found and more cars kept coming up. The best part of the Smoky Mountains is that it is 100% FREE!

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"If you are unsure of what to do and where to go head to on of the SM Visitor Centers and ask for some direction for your day. (They were extremely helpful)Went to Clingmans Dome for the first part of our trip. Definitely a must. From Sugarlands Visitor Center we drove roughly 13 miles up the mountains to get to CMan's Dome. The walk up to the tower at Cman's Dome is steep but only a half mile. I'm sure the 360 degree from the top of the observation tower is breathtaking but be ready for the possibility to not see anything because of the clouds. We arrived at CMan's Dome around 10am and it was a little crowded but there were still parking spots, but by hte time we got down at around 11am cars were parked .5-1 mile down from the designated parking lot. So get there early. On the way down we stopped at the Newfoundland Gap Overlook. Great spot to take a break eat lunch with your family, but it was kind of a revolving door of people as there wasn't much other than they stunning views of course.The last place we went to was Alum Cave Trail. Quite the long hike for a family, but if kids are adventurous and love nature then go for it. It's roughly a 4.5 round trip trail with a gorgeous river and some absolutely wonderful views of the surrounding mountains. The end of the trail (Alum Cave) is a great picnic spot/rest for a while before either continuing up the trail higher (2.7m) or heading back down. There were some people on the trail at times but not a ton of people so it was a nice quiet hike to hang out with my wife.You can wear running shoes in my opinion, but I would get hiking boots so as to not rough up the soles of your running shoes as the trail is filled with small jagged rocks.","July 10, 2018",best activity we did on our entire trip,5,"Pooler, Georgia",5

The scenery is breathtaking, there are plenty of Cabins/lodges/hotels to choose from depending on your style of travel and trip plans. The strip in Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge has plenty to do for kids and adults alike, although I would label pigeon forge the far more touristy part for family activities and the strip in Gatlinburg more laid back with plenty of restaurants, activities, and shopping. You can hike, see shows, find waterfalls, ice-skate in ober Gatlinburg, and do everything from go carts to scenic rest stops. Its all up to your taste, but one thing is for sure.

Much of the beauty can be seen from the car while driving through the park. This is particularly beneficial for seniors. We did climb to the top of Clingman's Dome - an uphill half mile walk.

The river running next to the road in certain places was pure heaven. We stopped and just ""took in"" the beauty; the sound of the water babbling across rocks and branches is so therapeutic. My teenage grandson climbed out to a boulder and sat there just listening to nature at its best. Rare moment to not have a screen of some sort in his face : ).

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"Went here for the first time in June and had a great time. The scenery was great and there was also plenty of wildlife to see. We definitely recommend visiting the Cades Cove area as we saw several black bears and the history of the region was interesting to learn about. Be sure to stop at the Mill in Cades Cove and check out how they used to make corn meal back in the day. Clingman's dome is also a must if you would like to get a great view of the park. The trail to the top is steep, but take your time and the end result is worth the relatively short hike.","July 1, 2018",Beautiful park to visit.,171,"Littleton, Colorado",5

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"The Great Smoky Mountains NP is very popular and it is very crowded much of the time. We drove through the Park to Cherokee, NC and wanted to stop at Clingmans Dome to climb the Observation Tower. It didn't happen. The Parking lot is way too small to accommodate vehicles and many visitors were parking at what I would guess was at least a half a mile down the road on the side of the road and walking up to the parking lot. From there it is a very steep walk to the Observation Tower. It was good that I have already made this trip to the Tower, otherwise I would have been completely frustrated because I don't think I would have the stamina to hike a half mile uphill to the parking lot, then another half mile uphill to the Tower. Also the Tower would have been totally packed with people. The NPS desperately needs to enlarge the parking area at Clingmans Dome. We did visit the Sugarlands and Oconoluftee Visitors Centers and both were very nice with attractive and informative displays.. There is a very nice, typical Appalachian farm recreation on the NC side that is free to tour, and I recommend that.","July 1, 2018",Pleasant visit,35,"Nashville, Tennessee",4

We camped a few nights inside the park at Elkmont, visited the main drives like Cades Cove and Roaring Fork, also Cataloochee, Newfound Gap and Clingmans Dome. Played in the rivers and had a picnic lunch at the Chimneys picnic area. Saw bear, deer, elk, wild turkeys and woodchucks. It was my granddaughters first time and she was just amazed! We cant wait to return. I have 2 complaints and one is they have started allowing tour buses into the park and mainly Cades Cove. Hate to see those big things and getting stuck behind one is awful. The other issue is getting traffic to move over in bear jams, and they need more pull offs. There should be signs stating they have to pull over. An emergency vehicle tried to get thru and there was a mile of cars blocking its path. I would hate to be waiting for that vehicle to come save my life! All in all its a slice of heaven.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,A drive through this park is highly recommended and one that you will not forget quickly. There is one important piece of advice/warning. This is THE most popular National Park with 11 million visitors a year. I was here 40 years ago in August and swore I would never come back because of the bumper to bumper traffic and resultant smog. This time we came in June and while the traffic was much better it was still VERY slow going. One car on a single lane road that is going very slow will cause traffic to back up quickly. I would highly recommend that you avoid this park in July and August when traffic increases greatly and the trailers and RVs cause traffic congestion unless of course you like bumper to bumper traffic in hot weather. That being said if you do want a challenge of July and August visits make sure your gas tank is full and your radiator is in good shape. It is very common to see vehicles with blown or overheated rads at the side of the road or cars that have run out of gas. One last tip. While bears and elks are often featured in the literature you probably won't see any in July and August---they are smarter than us and choose to avoid the droves of tourists!!!,"June 9, 2018",God's Beauty at its best!!!,17,"Mississauga, Canada",5

Plenty of pulloffs so you can let traffic by if you want to cruise around at a slower speed than the prevailing 35 mph speed limit.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"We stayed in Gatlinburg and spent 5 days hiking in the park. Absolutely beautiful! We debated staying on the NC side of the park but we determined that all of the most popular trails were on the TN side, and those were the ones we wanted to do. So, I have no idea what the situation is on the NC side of the park. The trails are extremely well maintained. You are never unsure of which way to head - there is really only one way once you are on a trail. We went the week of May 19th and while it was not crowded, it was well populated. Park rangers commented that during the summer months, it can take HOURS to drive down certain roads in the park, and I totally believe it. There is limited parking at trail heads and I have heard/read stories of people not being able to access trails easily, etc. I guess since this is the most visited park it is just overwhelmed during the summer months both with people who are there to hike, and those that really have Gatlinburg as their main vacation destination and are just driving through the park. Depending on where you are driving to in the park, roads can be a bit narrow and winding. Some areas are one way only. All are well paved and well maintained. Stunning views and the black bears are definitely out there! We saw a total of 6! So, in sum, this place is a gem. Beautiful nature and very enjoyable trails but do yourself a favor go during off-season to make sure that you get to enjoy it to its fullest without the huge crowds which will definitely impact time!","June 2, 2018",Absolutely beautiful...but make sure you go during off-season!,8,"Chalfont, Pennsylvania",5

The loop is closed to automobile traffic some mornings, so that would be the best time to bike. We saw 2 bears as we biked the loop.

We could see why the park was called the Smoky Mountains. When we drove into Gatlinburg, the gateway to the national park, we had stopped at the Visitor's Center before Gatlinburg. Talking to the volunteers, we were told which hikes were conducive for us. We purchased a trail map and a bird watching guide, each for $1. The park itself is beautiful!

I got to see 2 turkeys driving to Cherokee then on the way back to Gatlinburg I saw a mama bear and 2 cubs...that was thrilling!!I had hoped to see elk but no.On this route, there are 2 Visitor Centers.

But we did enjoy our drive from the Gatlinburg entrance point to Cades Cove and back. That is a beautiful drive, with lots of stunning venues for photos. One of the things I found unusual about the Park is the lack on an official entrance, with fees to get into the Park. You just drive in and out like any other area. We were not able to catch sight of any bears or elk, just deer and wild turkeys, but some of the clouds over the mountains made for some pretty photos, so I settled for that.","April 27, 2018",Beautiful - need a few days to appreciate everything,255,"Evanston, Illinois",5

There is something there to be seen in any season. There are trails that are broad and nearly flat as well as those that are more strenuous. Information and guidebooks are available at the visitor's center near Gatlinburg. If you plan on camping, you must have a reservation.

We could not begin to find enough words or photos to give adequate praise to this beautiful Park! Beginning with the genuine kindness and helpfulness of Park rangers and staff, the Park welcomes an astonishing number of 10 million visitors a year! We are always glad to be 2 of that number! We love nature and the Smokies are a literal paradise of natural beauty. Mountain vistas, amazing wildlife, magnificent trees, flowers, rock formations and waterfalls provide endless beauty. Visits to the historic structures of Cade's Cove and throughout the Park are another sources of great enjoyment.

The weather was good and we would have considered this drive a perfect antidote for the crowds, but we should have gone first thing in the morning, just beware!

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"1. If you visit the Cades Cove end of the park, plan on leaving early afternoon. The road near Sugarlands Visitor Center can back up for a long way later in the afternoon. 2. Chimney Tops trail is open, but it is blocked 1/4 mile from the actual Chimney Top. There is a new observation spot with a good view of the peak.3. Chimney Tops parking can get very full. If you are coming from Sugarlands, watch for a small pullout parking area immediately after you exit the tunnel. A lot of people pass this by, and its a short walk to the trailhead. 4. Alum Cave Trail parking is one of the busiest in the park. Plan on arriving early. The walk from your car can be as long as the trail on a busy day.5. Clingmans Dome is another very busy destination in the early afternoon. Traffic can back up a long way as cars stop and block traffic waiting for someone to leave. It's not worth walking a mile only to find you then have to climb a very steep hill. 6. The park doesn't stop at Clingmans Dome Road. There are some great overlooks ""on the other side,"" and Collins Creek Picnic Area was nearly empty when Chimney Tops Picnic area was crowded. 7. Mingo Falls is the best waterfall. You have to climb 159 steps, but then the walk is very short. Parking is limited, but it doesn't get too crowded since many tourists don't venture to the far side from Gatlinburg. During wet periods, the fall is spectacular.","April 2, 2018",A Tips to Save Time,152,"West Chester, OH",5

We like to stop and see the cabins, churches and Grave yards. It’s interesting to see how old some of the graves are and that there are also recent burials. One recommendation, and I do not work for the park. We are all very lucky this park is free to get into as many National Parks charge you to get into them. At the end of the Cades Cove loop there is a donation box, I would recommend you donate to the park, even if you can only donate a little.

It can get a little dangerous though, so watch kids closely. We just saw a little girl almost fall off a little cliff and dad caught her by her hand just in time, although she probably injured her back. It's worth the hike though but the area around the waterfalls got crowded. Probably best to go there off season.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"We fell in love with the Smokey Mountains 8 years ago, and have returned annually since. The Great Smokey Mountains National Park offers a wide variety of opportunities to experience the awesomeness of nature for everyone - from people who prefer to look at nature from their vehicles, to beginners who like to hike, but with handrails, to intermediate hikers who like to dive into nature, to the experienced trailblazer who wants a new adventure. A stop at Sugarlands Visitor Center is recommended, where one can find trail maps, historical information, and ""nature 101"" lessons. The hiking trails are well-maintained with wooden walking bridges spanning streams and creeks, under a canopy of lush vegetation, trees, and wildflowers. Our favorite trail is ""Chimney Tops"", a 5 mile nature hike crossing streams, winding around boulders, by waterfalls, and an abundance of wildlife. Past the Chimney Tops trail head, the paved roads take you to Newfound Gap, an Appalachian Trail access point and the state line between Tennessee and North Carolina. 9 miles past Newfound Gap is Clingman's Dome, highest point in Tennessee, and highest point on the Appalachian Trail, where on clear days you can see as far as 100 miles! the road to Clingman's Dome is paved, as well as the trail leading up to the observation tower.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"We were here a few years ago prior to the fires in Gatlinburg and we were curious to see whether things were ""bouncing back"" from the devastation. We were pleasantly surprised that most of our favorite spots were untouched and many of the areas that burned seemed to be on the mend with lots of undergrowth. We didn't get to see any wildlife on this trip, which was a bit of a disappointment, although we were only here for an afternoon and then had to go to daughter's volleyball tournament. I highly recommend visiting the park when you have lots of time to enjoy it. Get up early, bring a thermos and a picnic lunch and just drive through all of the little coves and up to the peaks. Make sure the car has lots of gas and good brakes though, they'll be hot when you come off the mountain!","February 4, 2018",Natural Beauty Surrounds You Everywhere,30,"Greensburg, Pennsylvania",5

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"I've been told Great Smoky Mountains is America's most popular national park. It's easy to see why. But the best time to visit is away from the tourist seasons. We visited on Dec. 13 and there were few fellow tourists, which made for easier driving and better photography. The park's main road is a typical two-lane winding road but there are many stopping points -- most about a quarter-mile apart -- for driving breaks and good photos. Do pack water before visiting. And be sure to see Cades Cove, 20 miles inside the park on the Gatlinburg side, which has original pioneer homes, cabins and other buildings that have been preserved. Some have been brought to Cades from other areas in the park; others are originals; all are pretty interesting. Only a couple Cades homes require a short walk from the parking area; others are close to parking.","December 20, 2017",Beautiful views 5 minutes from town,51,"Antioch, Tennessee",5

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"The top places we visited were Clingman's Dome and Cade's Cove. The view of the mountains and the sunset from Clingman's Dome is amazing and will leave you in awe of the wonders of nature. It's chilly at the top so bring a sweater. There's a small gift shop at Clingman's Dome and a parking lot near the trail-head. Cade's Cove is where we saw lots of deer wandering the fields in the valley. The leaves of the trees were very colorful and beautiful as we happened to be here at the right time to observe the fall foliage change. There's also a small gift shop and restrooms at the Cade's Cove parking lot. Traffic is a little slow in this area as people are taking their time to view the scenery while driving on single lane roads, so be prepared accordingly. We also crossed the park from Gatlinburg, TN to Cherokee, NC. They closed the main road that night due to inclement weather in the mountains so we had to detour the long way to get back to our hotel in Gatlinburg. Keep this in mind if you decide to cross the mountains as they can close certain roads at the last minute and you have to have alternate plans to get around. The Sugarlands visitor center had good displays and exhibits about the park and friendly rangers to answer questions. There's also a free 20 minute video about the park. I really enjoyed the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and hope to return here again one day. If you really want to explore the park further and go deeper into the park via the trails, don't bring a pet with you since they're not allowed on the central trails. They're only allowed on the Gatlinburg trail near the Sugarlands visitor center and on the Oconaluftee trail near the Cherokee entrance.","December 4, 2017",Gorgeous american national park with great nature views,126,"Jacksonville, Florida",5

We love visiting the scenic overlooks, always stopping at Newfound Gap for a few minutes. We enjoy seeing the tunnels on the way up and back down the mountain. We like to visit the Oconaluftee Visitor Center and farm over on the North Carolina side. We also swing by Mingus Mill and take a walk up by the mill race. Cades Cove is a must-see for us, and we often go over several times if we stay three or more days. We have been fortunate to see black bears there at times, as well as deer, turkeys and other wildlife. We enjoy visiting the old log cabins scattered about the cove. We sometimes take a picnic lunch of sandwiches, chips and drinks, and will pull over beside the road to eat and take in the views. We also like to stop by the visitor center to visit Cable Mill and the farm buildings there. I like going by The Sinks to take photos of the water thundering over the rocks. If you like to like there are many hiking trails. If you like to drive through the woods, take a drive on the Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail. There are a couple of cabins and farms there that you can stop to see, as well as some beautiful streams to stop and see. The Smokies have a lot to do and see if you love the outdoors. There is something for everyone. If you have young children, you might like to stop by the Chimneys Picnic Area.

If you are staying in Gatlinburg you can take the trolley route through part of the mountains. The Tan route will take you up into the smpkey mountains to Sugarland visitor center and to the parking lot at Laurel Falls. The trip lasts about 1.5 hours and it only costs $2.

Give yourself time to visit Cades Cove and learn a little about life in the mountains in the1800's. Don't get mad when traffic stops on the 2 lane roads, usually means there are bears ahead and some good photo opportunities from the safety of your car. Don't wander near or feed the bears because they live from the land and need to remain sufficient and Mama bear could be near and she is not as sweet as the cubs.","November 9, 2017",The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is a treasure.,57,"Moab, Utah",5

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"Our national parks are a credit to our country & I absolutely love them. GSMP is a gem.Touring tips:the park can be packed so start very early in the AM- especially during summer & fall leaf season.Go to Cades Cove when it opens to avoid the maddening slow drive if you arrive after 10am. If you go early, you have a better chance of seeing animals.When hiking, bring water & have on hiking boots- no sandals please- that's how you twist an ankle.Get a hiking stick- especially if you are a senior- it helps a lot.Go to the visitors center & ask the rangers questions- they are a wealth of knowledge. For example, it was foggy so we asked them if Clingmans dome was fogged it. They told us it was & anything over 4,000 feet elevation was that day so we made another plan.Laurel Falls is the most popular walk in the park on the only paved trail. It's about 300 feet elevation & all uphill- it took us almost an hour to hike up it as we walked slow taking lots of pictures & looking at the beautiful scenery. If it has rained the rocks near the falls are slippery so caution is needed.Bring a picnic lunch - no food other than snacks are sold in the park.No gas stations inside the park so make sure you have at least a half tank of gas.Don't forget your camera!We spent a week in the park as there is lots to see & do. That was the right amount of time as we did not have to rush.If you like my review, please give me a helpful vote as it encourages me to keep doing reviews.","November 7, 2017",touring advice,1194,"Falls Church, Virginia",5

I have been told on average 2 motorcycle riders are killed on this road each year. Had to pull over more than once to let faster vehicles by.Our Google maps then took us on many back roads through the mountains and eventually to Townsend and then to Gatlinburg.Yes we missed going over the mountains and seeing Clingman's Dome and all the great colors on the trees, but we have taken that ride many times and always love the trip.If you ever get the chance to see the Great Smoky Mountains Go see them, you will never regret the trip no matter what season it is.","November 2, 2017",441 closed,123,"Kenosha, Wisconsin",5

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"Foliage was disappointing for the third week in October, but mother nature controls that. Park entry is currently free and may beautiful scenes just driving through the part from Cherokee to Gatlinburg. We have been several times and ran into two issues that were new to us.First Clingman's Dome tower was closed, but there was no notice until you sat in traffic for over two hours and walked up to the area. After such a long wait the restrooms were popular--pit toilets. At least they had hand sanitizer available, but four stalls were not enough for the dozens of people in each line. Parking is inadequate as well. Traffic stopped as people were waiting for spots and the narrow road did not allow for passing them. There was no place to U turn and retreat! People parked all over the place including blocking walkways and side walks. There was no security to move them along!!! Cars parked on the side of the narrow road for at least mile from the area probably longer. It was absolutely awful! Unless it is a clear day you can't see well anyway. We will never go to that area again.Cade's Cove was another trouble area. The one lane road had traffic stopped several times for long periods of time as 3 rumors of bear sightings were learned. Rangers were very slow in reaching the areas, on foot!!! Seems horse back or motor cycles would save precious time and daily hours of walking for miles! If they had arrived sooner, the problems would have been much less. Cars were literally parked in the road way of the narrow one way road. Normally the time is 2-3 hours for the trip and sight seeing stops on the way. Four hours tops. It took us more than 5 hours and we only stopped for short periods of time twice.

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"Past experiences in Great Smoky Mountains were impacted by rain all day. This time we experienced the rain differently. The clouds flowing over peaks and ridges gave the landscape a mysterious effect, muted the October colors and created hundreds of roadside waterfalls. On a sunny day these fountains of rain cascading from the rocky outcrops and sheer cliffs and walls. A glorious show provided by the storm.Next day was bright sunshine and cooler weather so it was off to the Cataloochee Valley. Our hope was to encounter part of the newly introduced elk herd and visit some of the homesteads remaining from the Park Service buyout of the residents of the valley in the 1940's, ( most residents were allowed to sell and remain in their homes until they were unable to care for themselves or died). As fascinating as the history of the remaining buildings is the highlight of our day was seeing a bull with 20 or so cows in his harem and his defense of them when a younger bull tried to challenge him. Hiking the trails in the valley gave us access to the remains of remote homesteads. Of concern to us and the park is the great number of names, initials and dates etched or written onto the walls of these buildings by ignorant,uncaring visitors purposefully defacing these park attractions.","October 25, 2017",Finally a sunny day,78,"Charlottesville, Virginia",5

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"The Great Smoky Mountain National Park is a beautiful refuge and escape into nature. In my opinion, it's a park that should definitely be visited if you're on the East Coast. But, other national parks like Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon are more awe-inspiring.Be sure to visit Cades Cove if you want to spot bears. Though traffic can be pretty heavy during the busy seasons.To spot elk, check out the field adjacent to the Oconaluftee Visitor Center. Cataloochee also has elk, but is fairly remote.Clingmans Dome has wonderful views from the top. The elevated Observatory is currently closed. The view from the parking lot alone is definitely worth the short drive. Traffic going to the peak can be pretty heavy during the busy seasons.For me, the most enjoyable drive was on the Foothills Parkway. Even during peak season in October there were hardly any people on this road and the views were amazing.Roaring Fork Motorway is a very easy outing from Gatlinburg and rewards you with beautiful river views and some historic properties.","October 21, 2017",Review & Tips,31,"Tampa, Florida",5

Fall is my favorite time to cross the national park and see the beautiful fall colors. In the winter the snow capped mountains are spectacular. In the early morning and late evening there are often wildlife. The kids favorite part is stopping and wading in the streams. You need to allow a minimum of 1 1/2 hours one way.

There are also numerous nature trails and I've never been disappointed with the various hiking paths. Narrow roads and some hairpin turns are part of the adventure as well. Unless you have a fear of heights, I would also recommend stopping at Clingmans Dome, the highest point of the Smoky's. This will require additional, up hill walking to a viewing tower structure.Just drive carefully and enjoy the ever-changing landscape that seriously can change within minutes due to the moving clouds!

Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"The park has all the seasons, spring you can see the azaleas and mountain laurel bloom. Summer you get the green trees. Fall you get the colored leaf change. Winter the road through the park is closed due to hazardous conditions. Plenty of rivers to stop and wade in as well as some swimming holes and some water falls. If your lucky you could se a bear, just keep your distance these are not trained ears. Elk and turkey can be seen also. Several old home steads to see how people lived in bygone years. Traffic can be terrible around Cades Cove, especially if wildlife is around as people will stop in the middle of the road to gawk at them. Traffic will come to a stop on any road if there are wildlife around. Plenty of places to have a picnic if this is what you want to do just make sure you bring your food and trash back out with you as you don’t want the wildlife to get use to humans feeding them. Hiking is also there in the park and if my memory serves me I think only one person has been killed by a bear in past years, did I state these animals aren’t domesticated. If the wildlife is a concern to you you can buy some bear spray and keep it with you as this is legal, as is CCW in the park if you have your license and reciprocity applies to you home state.
