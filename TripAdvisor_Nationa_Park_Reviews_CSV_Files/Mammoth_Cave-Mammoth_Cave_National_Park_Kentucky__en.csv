Mammoth Cave,"Compared to caves like Carlsbad Caverns and Natural Bridge Caverns, Mammoth Cave was a huge disappointment. We chose the Extended Historic tour hoping to learn about the history of the cave. The best part of the tour was the “extended” part, which was still disappointing. The guide rushed us by two buildings that held consumption patients in the 1840s. She barely flipped the light on for us to see the buildings as we were hurried by in a single file line. The tour was rushed, crowded, and the guide was completely uninformative. Save your money and read the history in less than 5 minutes online.

Mammoth Cave,"You have to definitely check the times for all the tours so you can make the one you want and actually go into the caves. We picked the 2 hour cave tour that went miles below the surface. Our guides Alesha / Gillespie knew there way around and all the history filled with the tour. Multiple people asked many questions and they were ready with plenty of information! I especially liked all the different caves and spaces we went through. We want to come back for 6 hour crawling tour so we can experience how they did it back in time. They have camping, a hotel, a post office and multiple hotels. We stayed at the Holiday Inn express in cave city KY it was perfect! You can literally make a right out of the hotel and have a very pleasant drive to Mammoth cave on the backroads using your GPS. Great place anytime of the year! Thank you to all the employees of Mammoth Cave!","October 16, 2019",Our guides Alesha / Gillespie were excellent! We did the 2 hour hour it was very informative!

Mammoth Cave,"We took the 2-hour historic tour. The time flew by. We were in some gigantic cave rooms and some very tight squeezes. We learned some history and geology. Our tour guide, Jim, was fabulous. The 2-mile walk is well paced so even the youngest in our group (6) had no trouble. We wish we had time for more tours or had made plans to stay in the lodge or cottages on site.","October 16, 2019",Enjoyable and informative ,10,St. Paul MN,5
Mammoth Cave,"Did not know what to expect. There was a nice visitor center , with information about Mammoth cave. We took a 2 1/2 hour tour lead by a park ranger. It is a national park.

Mammoth Cave,"We did Great Onyx Cave with Chris the tour guide. It was a wonderful cave tour and the perfect length. You enter down about 40 steps carved in Stone with handrails and walls on each side. I am afraid of heights and have trouble on metal open-grate stairs where you can see a far ways down, like on other cave tours, so this was a good choice for me. It didn’t feel exposed on the stairs. Also, inside the cave, it mostly feels like walking on flat ground. There are no narrow walkways with steep drop offs on either side, like I have experienced in other caves.I am also a bit claustrophobic. I was fine on this tour. You go from room to room with wide halls in between. A few spots had low ceilings (I am very tall and had to watch my head; my 5’4” son was fine). There was nothing that felt too tight or confining. It is still a cave so I had a moderate amount of claustrophobic discomfort but it was manageable and I didn’t feel panicked. We spent around 90 minutes total in the cave. The tour itself was excellent. My kids, 9 and 11, enjoyed it. Chris the ranger/tour guide held their attention with stories of geology and cave history. The 11-yr old said his favorite thing was the suspense that the ranger built through his stories and the “reveal” at the end of the cave tour. The 9-yr old liked the ranger’s jokes and liked the cave formations we saw, especially the Nativity formation. The lanterns were cool too. We had one lantern per 3-4 people so our family of four had one lantern. It was a neat way to see the cave.

Mammoth Cave,"After doing the Gothic Avenues Tour we wanted to do another tour of Mammoth Cave. We asked the helpful rangers at visitors center what they recommend. They told us about Dripstones so we did that one. Had to take a 20 minute bus ride to get to the entrance of this cave. It was quite different from Gothic. Very narrow stairs leading down to the cave. Stairs were moist and handrails were wet as well. This tour IS NOT for the claustrophobic person not for the, to be politically correct, nor the big bone person as well. I am 180 pounds and barely slipped by some of the rock formations. Our group was wQuite large with about 100 people. Also 2 screaming toddlers which drove 98 people crazy. Hint- if you see this happening before the tour starts, reposition yourself as far away as possible from those people. We were treated to beautiful stalagmites and stalactites. Many many beautiful rock formations on this tour. It was 2 hours in length. Tour guide was exceptional. Dry detailed information. Great tour barring the crying kids.

Mammoth Cave,"There are so many reviews of the cave & the tours so I'm going to try to respond to the things I was wondering about before going- we did the Domes & Dripstones tour with 2 ten year olds, one who is often up for anything and the other who is more skittish. They both did great on this tour--- unless you're near the guide (I wasn't so I don't really know), there is not much stopping and listening to a lot of information (two or maybe three times for a just a few minutes each) which might be disappointing for some people if they really want the guided tour experience, but it is a TON of people (?75-100?) so you have to keep moving- this was an advantage being on the tour with kids who probably wouldve gotten antsy listening too much & not moving. The less enthusiastic child didn't complain at all the whole time which was an achievement! Also it is not 2 hours of walking, the 2 hours includes the bus rides each way as well as a little orientation at the entrance and waiting to get into the cave entrance so I'd say total walking time is maybe 1 hr 35 min. I was nervous about the claustrophobia warnings as well- I will say the first 10-15 minutes is tight and my husband opted to be at the back of the line in order to have a little more space between all the people, as you are pretty much descending in single file one on top of the other until you get to the bottom which does take 10-15 min. In many spots the space between the rocks is 2-3 ft in width and you also have railings on at least one if not both sides of you which can be as narrow as about 2 ft wide in some spots. There are some spots where you have to stoop or bend but not that many and not excessively where you'd end up with a sore back or something (unless you have back issues already perhaps). It's pretty dark but the walkway is lit and the walls are periodically too, my daughter was not at all scared in that regard. Once down in the cave, the narrow parts are much fewer though there are some steep areas where it is steeply sloping rock and one staircase that is pretty narrow & steep. For people with heights fears, I never felt uneasy at all but I think you could also avoid that by intentionally not looking over railings- you really do have to kind of lean over and look down to see the height. We really enjoyed the tour, I'm glad we did it because it was a little bit adventurous feeling but not difficult and still fun for the kids, and long enough to feel like we really saw a decent amount of different types of cave/rock formations.","October 14, 2019",Domes & Dripstones with kids,27,North Carolina,4

Mammoth Cave,"We spent 2 days visiting Mammoth Cave and it was well worth it! This is the WORLD’S LONGEST CAVE SYSTEM so exploring it was amazing. We got a tip from a ranger who now works at another national park and she recommended 2 tours, so with the variety of tours available, we felt like we had a head start for our visit. We first did the Frozen Niagara Tour. This is the tour that gives you what most people expect in a cave - stalactites and stalagmites. The formations are beautiful. The second day we did the Historic Tour which was fascinating. We saw relics from mining operations used during the War of 1812! We saw old graffiti on the ceilings using candle smoke from the early 1800’s. We saw amazingly cavernous rooms. All-in-all, a great tour.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave National Park, set deep in the Kentucky woods, is in a beautiful, remote location. The Visitor Center was clean with a well thought out floor plan that made for easy access to tickets, information, gift shops, and restrooms. The center was designed with plenty of windows for a lot of natural light and views that gave us a terrific look at the Kentucky woods in the fall. The walk down the hollow to the cave, lined with towering trees along the rocky hillside, was very scenic.The cave itself was impressive. The sheer size of the main tunnel was much larger than I expected. This was to caves as the interstate is to roads! And, much like the interstate moves a massive amount of cars, the NPS moved a lot of people on our 2 hour historic tour through Mammoth Cave. We spent much of the time either walking or waiting with very little time to enjoy the natural wonder. The guides were great and shared a lot of information about the site.

Mammoth Cave,"We came here on a weekend getaway trip. We hiked on the trails. I believe it was the styx and echo trail? Anyway, it was about a 2.75 mile walk. We did it in about an hour. The way going down was zig-zag. The way going up was 1/2 mile uphill. It wasn't too bad. We aren't athletes, but we do walk about 6 miles/week. A lot of that are hills.Next, we took the historic cave tour. It costed $38 for the two of us. It was about 2 miles down and then 155 continuous stairs up. It included the fat man misery and the tall man misery. I am 5'2"" and had absolutely no problems. I only ducked about 3 times. My husband is 6'3"" and ducked a lot. He had to walk a good amount hunched over. It wasn't bad at all. People very tall and very overweight may want to consider a different cave tour if this will be a problem. The spaces can be as narrow around the knees as barely fitting one leg next to the other. It is 54 degrees in there, also, so be sure to bring a jacket if you get cold easily. It is a paved tour, so that's good. However, due to the length of the tour (2 hours), I would recommend comfortable walking shoes. I would love to go again. It was beautiful and a lot of options to be active. ","October 6, 2019",Very beautiful ,57,"Bowling Green, Kentucky",5

We heard from one of the rangers that they allowed 70 some people. Usually that would not be a big deal. We heard one of the rangers talking to someone else that we had to skip some things because we had too many slow people. Certainly not fair for the rest of us to get cheated out of part of it so they could stay on schedule. They DID NOT give us a discount for missing some of it. I'm sorry we heard that. It kind of leaves you with a bad taste. It was a good tour, but I'll always know we missed some.","October 1, 2019",Grand Avenue Tour,1,"Plymouth, Minnesota",3

The first time I went there I went on a tour and it really fun and interesting. The cave system turns out to be very cold inside. the second time I went there I went camping with some friends. The camping site is in a forest near the Mammoth Cave entrance. Finally the third time I went there I went on a tour thats called ""Fat Man's Missery"" this was the a branch of the cave system that is very small hence the name.

Every National Park has it's own charms and the cave is obviously the main attraction, but I enjoyed the hiking, wildlife and photography. I went in the off-season, during the week, so the crowd level was about a 2 out of 10, which was great. The only negative is that it got dark just before 7 PM, so evening activities were a minimum.

Mammoth Cave,"Beautiful park! We took 2 tours, accessible & Frozen Niagara. The accessible tour is accessible in that you drive your own car to the elevator entrance which takes you down to the cave so no bus or van and there is a fairly level, concrete path for wheelchairs & scooters. However, the path is not lit well enough and many of the folks using scooters couldn’t see. The rangers with flashlights were either at the front or back and didn’t seem to even notice that there were long gaps in the crowd whenever a scooter was involved. Luckily, I brought my own flashlight. The rangers don’t like for you to have your own flashlight but it is a safety necessity for anyone with any type of visual, hearing or mobility issue. Also, there was only one bench the entire length of the tour! It was much longer walk time wise than we anticipated so if you need a seat, bring one of those folding cane chairs. This tour would be good for anyone who’s never been in a cave before as it was kind of boring compared to other caves because it doesn’t have lots of different types of formations. The other tour that we took, the Frozen Niagara tour was very cool, although not accessible for wheelchairs or scooters because of overhangs and tight spots. Lots of very interesting formations in this section. Definitely, if you are able, go take a look at the historic opening. Be warned, it is a very steep walk up & down a long paved road but lots of benches along the way. Bring a jacket!","September 23, 2019",Very cool!,2,,4

Mammoth Cave,"All the stairs in most of the tours scared me (85YO), so I signed up for the Frozen Niagara tour. (6 stairs). Had to take a bus to the cave entrance. While there are only 6 steps,(the website said something about elevators) a 6 degree ramp with some extremely low ceilings was the decent method. There were not too many formations (as explained in t he beginning of the tour), but we were whisked by those that did exist. A quick 10 minute to the end of the tour with a couple of quick stops was the entire tour. At the end, a few geological and other facts about the caves in general and then a non-stop return to the bus and a return to the VC. The rangers were in some kind of rush. I would have preferred to go slower and look at the formations that were there. Overall very disappointing. The VC was interesting, but I recommend the Crystal Onyx tour. Much more to see and MUCH SLOWER.","September 22, 2019",Very poor guide,17,"Pekin NY, United States",2

We had interesting, knowledgeable guides who gave a great background to the history of the cave system and stories of the people who had been involved in the past. We were expecting it to be a lot more strenuous but didn't find it bad at all. However, we both do a lot of cycling, hiking and hillwalking so we are probably at the upper end of the general fitness range.

We took the tour that went to the underground cafeteria. Challenges came after this; Tall Man’s Agony & a similar torture for those who weren’t thin. I had a harness on my toddler; still many parts were terrifying because of drop offs, etc. Those children are adults with children of their own. I would like to go back, but due to a brain tumor, I would have to have a tour that required limited mobility. I recall a lake & boats. That seems more realistic for me now.

Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I did the domes and Dripstones tour yesterday . The tour was immediately made not enjoyable by our tour guide “ Charlie “. He was rude almost from the beginning. At one point our entire group was chastised because there was a gap as we were walking through the cave . First off , there were numerous children in our group which were in awe of their surroundings . The gap was made mostly because when we entered the cave we were broke up into 2 groups of 12-14 people . The 2 Nd group ( our group) was instructed not to enter the 2 Nd door until we were told so by the guide in the rear . We stood at the 2 Nd entrance waiting for instructions from our guide in the rear . This created the gap between us and the 1 st group . Charlie was absolutely out of line for his comments to us . We were all adults and he was our paid guide . He should remember that he has a job BECAUSE of us . Today , my husband and myself did the Styx river tour . What an in incredible time we had with our 2 outstanding guides ... Bryce and Shannon. We thoroughly enjoyed every second . Our guides were full of facts and information ( unlike our guide yesterday). They were just incredibly wonderful people overall . They were respectful and professional yet very personable.

Mammoth Cave,We opted for the Domes & Dripstones tour- 40 people total. There are 500 extremely narrow steps which are slightly damp and the rails are cold and moist (it’s underground and definitely cold!) The first 20 minutes of the tour was winding down 200 feet into the cave on narrow winding open grated stairs! (Beautiful but rather impossible to stop to enjoy the scenery because you have to pay attention to where you’re stepping). I loved every minute of it! Once past the “domes” (the narrow passages) we entered into a large open area! (Beware- they turn out the lights for a minute or two to let you experience the darkness). We then traversed back up steps toward the Dripstones (stalactites and stalagmites) through the frozen Niagara and the drapery Room. Absolutely LOVED the caves and the grounds and will be back to explore another tour!! Don’t forget to walk down to the entrance of the historic cave (it’s free and only about 200 yards down a paved path). It’s a beautiful entrance! ,"September 6, 2019",Domes & Dripstones Tour is fantastic!! Take a sweater shirt or jacket!! ,21,,5
Mammoth Cave,"This was our favorite stop on our vacation through Kentucky & Tennessee. It is very much worth experiencing. Our choice was the Drips & Domes tour. We took our 12 year old adventurous daughter and she was blown away by how cool it was to be in a real cave, especially one of such size and with great history. There are so many amazing formations to see, all without feeling claustrophobic. There are tight spots, where you need to scoot against the wall to let other groups pass and rock to watch for if you are tall (like my husband), but if you are patient and keep your eyes ahead, you will totally enjoy the experience. The last section will take your breath away, (take the stairs, they are not hard. I have bad knees)...don't miss out!

Mammoth Cave,"As a plus size woman, I was a little bit worried about participating in the Historic tour of Mammoth Cave. The ranger did explain all of the parts of the tour well in advance. There is a section called ""Fat Man's Misery"" that is only 18 inches wide. He said most adults need to turn sideways to go through that section of the rock. The next section is called ""Tall Man's Misery"" as you need to bend down to go through a low area of rock. At the end of the tour, there are 100 steps to climb. Everyone on our tour (including me) made it through the entire tour just fine. Here are some tips: wear sturdy shoes (tennis shoes or hiking boots), stay close to the ranger at the front as the pace is slower, wear a light sweater or jacket, take a bottle of water (or chew gum), and wear gardening gloves (makes it easier to position yourself going through the rocks especially when you have to bend over for balance).

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave boasts that it is the largest cave structure in the world. It may very well be. But that is the main reason that this cave has become so famous. There are far prettier show caves. There are more interesting caves elsewhere. But this cave is the biggest.There are several different tours highlighting different parts of the cave. You really have to choose one unless you want to fill a day with different and sometimes overlapping tours. The tours sell out quickly so MAKE A RESERVATION weeks in advance or you'll be disappointed.Because the cave is so large, you have to choose a section. I went on the Domes and Dripstones Tour. The guide was very dry. The group exceedingly large. We moved slowly and deliberately. The tour should have take half the time. The most interesting part of the tour was the walk down the stairs in a narrow shaft. Not necessarily for the faint of heart. The dripstone formation at the end of the slow walk was beautiful but not enough of a payoff for a distressingly slow visit. The food options at the cave are adequate at best. The gift stores are a bit overpriced.Go because you want to say you've been there. Don't expect a magnificent cave.","September 2, 2019",Largest Cave Is Its Claim to Fame,520,"Palm Beach Gardens, Florida",4
Mammoth Cave,"We went on the Domes and Dripstones tour and it was challenging, mostly due to the pace set by the front. Another guest and I talked about how great it would be if an “Over-60” tour were offered for those tours deemed moderate. Maybe charge a little more for the added time it would take. I know a lot of Seniors would appreciate the opportunity to see more than the easy tour. It was interesting, but the rush made it less enjoyable.","September 1, 2019",I have a great recommendation,7,"Grandview, Tennessee",4
Mammoth Cave,"There is literally a tour for everyone even a wheelchair accessible one. As everyone else suggested reserve your tours before they sell out but not only that pick up your tickets the day before if your schedule allows that way you don’t have to stand in line or get there a half hour early. The accessible tour is great and you are able to see a lot for such a short tour. We had Jacob, Nat, Autumn, Jacob, Steven, and Shannon for guides and they were all friendly and informative. If all else fails and you can only do the self guided it will give you a very good idea of how big the cave is and you get to go in the natural entrance.","August 31, 2019",A tour for everyone,9,"Bucyrus, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"Great!!! Must see cave formations, decent 2 hour tour. Kind-of too much for a 5 year old in a mad mood, but great and not quite enough for an interested 8 year old in a good mood. Physically slightly more demanding than anticipated based on the ‘moderately demanding’ label. Ground is uneven and wet, slippery in some places. The stops for historical instruction by the guides were a bit too long and dry for the kids but perfect for me. ","August 31, 2019",Domes and dripstones tour,5,"Taft, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,We only had a half day there and arrived around noon. We were able to buy tickets for the 2 hour Historic Tour of the cave (walking about 2 miles) which was really fabulous. I wish the tour guides would have provided more narration about the areas we went through . The visitor center has some nice exhibits that provide good information on the cave's history.

Some parts of the cave tour are very tight so if that bothers you I'd consider not going. Only downside was the tour didn't allow for enough time to take photos. No flash photography is allowed, but night shot is able to capture some great photos.

We did not reserve a tour ahead and that was a mistake. When we arrived at 2pm all tours were booked for the next 3 hours. They advertised a ""Self-Guided Tour"" which we learned upon arrival was not available on the day of our visit. Would like to go back and explore again.

About 15 of us in the rear actually looked at the beautiful cave & took pictures unlike the front 65 who ran through. I was highly disappointed. I could have walked through the cave myself for all i got from the ranger. ","August 29, 2019",cave is amazing history tour was not ,55,dc metro area,3
Mammoth Cave,I would recommend and suggest reading ahead of time about the different cave tours that you can take. As soon as you walk in there will be an informational desk where they should be able to answer your additional questions. Then you can proceed to purchase your cave tour tickets. Our mistake was not reviewing the information ahead of time and then being told to review the tours and come back to purchase which tour we wanted. We decided to take the Frozen Niagara Cave Tour. It was a nice tour and our guide was very informative. The only thing that was unexpected that I wished We were told ahead of time was that the guide turned off the lights at the end to see if we could hear the crickets. This scared both of my children (as one is afraid of the dark and the other one is afraid of bugs). ,"August 29, 2019",1st time to Mammoth Cave,5,,4
Mammoth Cave,"You really have to want to get here to stamp your National Park Service passport. It’s that remote, but totally worth the side trip through Kentucky. Mammoth Cave boasts 84+ miles of spelunking. We opted for the Extended Historical tour, which had half as many tourists, for a two-mile hike through the Rotunda, Fat Man’s Misery, a TB “hospital,” and stairway exit up through the Dome. Our tour took 2.5 hours. We did not get to see the Niagara formation. At 5’4” even I had to crouch through the narrower passages. I observed that “Slim” (no body shaming) ahead of me made it thru with little/no misery. My cave comedian did not get to deliver his signature line distinguishing stalagmites and stalactites. Mammoth is a mostly-dry limestone cave with no floor-to-ceiling drip formations. No Mammoths, either, it’s just named as a superlative for biggest. The accommodations at the park lodge were nice and clean, Mid century modern. No cell service, no GPS, limited WiFi in the Visitors Center, TV received one station, only CBS. Nice trails. Lots of deer, squirrels and stars. The Green River dining room had good food and nice service (thank you, Debbie and Patty). Surprised to discover that the park concessionaire served Uppercut and Dreaming Tree wines, two faves. Overall, we enjoyed a pleasant overnight stay and NPS experience at Mammoth Cave.

Mammoth Cave,"This was my first trip here and I really struggled finding useful information to help. So I will try to give info that would have been nice before going. First: Don’t follow Electronic maps. It SAYS that in ALL the sites! The Ferry Rd is closed and that is the one electric maps want you to follow. Second: Most of the tours don’t have bathrooms. If you have an issue with holding it for at least 2 hrs, do your research and pick a shorter tour. Third: Get tickets early if you are going at peak season. Fourth: Difficulty level is not that bad. However, I counted 513 steps on the Domes tour. The first 250 were down a very steep and narrow passage. If you are very claustrophobic, this is NOT the trip for you! Once you get to the bottom, it’s really not bad. The longest stretch of up-stair climbing was 49 steps. This was optional. Fifth: This tour is a GOVERNMENT own property and they DO NOT have all the bells, whistles and pretty lights of commercial and private tours. It was the MOST informative tour about caves I have ever been in ( I have seen at least 6 other caves in the north east)! That being said, you might not find it very exciting if you are expecting colorful lighting and a big special at the end. It isn’t a great tour for people who need to be entertained and pampered. Six: And Lastly! Please don’t be that person! Our guide tour is a very scheduled event and they make it clear that we will be walking at a brisk pace. Don’t stop in the middle of the walk way to take pictures and trip up the whole group!!!","August 21, 2019",Mammoth Caves: First Timers!,10,,5

Mammoth Cave,"We did the Domes and Dripstones tour last weekend. We booked our tickets online the day before after reading that the tours may be sold out if you wait until you arrive at the park. We went to the will call desk and got our tickets with no issues. We enjoyed the museum while waiting for our tour time. Before you get on the bus to do this tour, the park ranger goes through some information regarding the many stairs and narrow areas that you will go through. They aren’t trying to scare you, just preparing you. If you can’t do lots and lots of stairs, are slightly claustrophobic, or don’t like heights, this may not be the tour for you. It is geared more for people who are into geology and rocks. It was very informative and we saw some very cool formations. We enjoyed our time in the cave and wish we would have had time to take one of the tours from the historic entrance.","August 18, 2019",Domes and Dripstones Tour,5,"Detroit, Michigan",4
Mammoth Cave,"Family trip and we did 2 different tours. The first was the historic tour which was about 2 hours, long and is a bit physically challenging so might be a bit difficult for elderly or young children. It had a lot of interesting terrain, and wide open spaces. If you like history, this tour has a lot of it spoken by the ranger guides. The dome and dripstones tour was easier, shorter and ended with great cave formations.","August 18, 2019",2 different tours,12,"Miami, Florida",4
Mammoth Cave,"Called the park service to buy a tour of the park the day before arrival. Told them my wife had MS and was somewhat disabled. They suggested a tour that had only 126 steps. My wife said she could do that, so no prob. Arrived at the park for the tour. Rode the bus to the cave entrance and began the walk down into the cave. You go down a ""never-ending"" spiral starway over 300 steps to the cave bottom. About half way down my wife began having trouble. There is NO returning to the top as you are with 120 other people. At the bottom she became totally unable to take one step further. Four park rangers and a TN state police officer graciously came down to carry her out on a stretcher-chair. They were wonderful. But for the rest of our vacation she was in a wheelchair unable to walk. I blame the person in the park service office that did not represent the difficulty of the tour to us. I got my credit card company to refund us the expense of the tour but the remainder our vacation was made much more difficult due to that person's misguidance. Plus Mammoth Cave is so very plain without interesting formations. Just a large deep cave you walk through wondering when the interesting parts will come. Not. Go to Carlsbad if you want to see a real cave. Plus, it has a elevator for emergencies.","August 18, 2019",I have visited most of the US national Parks and this was a downer,34,"North Las Vegas, Nevada",1
Mammoth Cave,"An excellent tour facilitated by a knowledgeable ranger who had the ability to make everything seem a new experience for her and for the rest of the group. The tour took about four hours, but probably could be done in about half that time. Whilst there were a couple of reasonably slippy slopes none of the hills or distance are onerous. That there is such emphasis on the need for physical fitness perhaps is an indication of the poor health of many of those seeking to undertake this tour.While it was a four hour tour there were two restroom stops during this tour which made the experience much more comfortable! Many of the sites and tunnels were fascinating, we brought a flashlight which enabled us to see a lot of the additional graffiti and darker areas, that said this drew a couple of complaints.Highly recommended, but book ahead as all tours were full on the 2 days we were at the park","August 18, 2019",Grand Avenue Tour ,10,"Warminster, United Kingdom",5

I would definitely rate this moderate. There are a lot of stairs but you can go at your own pace. My husband has a fear of heights but this was no problem. It's nothing like doing a rim hike. Maybe different people's fear of heights manifest differently but really this wasn't at all a problem. A friend who did it said the same thing. We only had time for one tour, and we were happy with this experience. It's fun and interesting.","August 17, 2019",Dripstones,0,,4

It was very narrow and sometimes a little tight, or had to walk bent over. Not a great tour for people not in shape. It was quick moving so it was difficult to take many pictures on the tour. The guides were good and gave a lot of information about the history of Mammoth Caves. The part that we all liked the most was the Niagra portion of the tour. This is where there was stalagmites and stalactites and a lot more interesting cave formations. The rest of the tour was walking through rock with a few interesting spots. It was good but I prefer seeing the other formations more. Good tour but we will do another tour if/when we return.","August 16, 2019",Make reservations early.,10,"Clarkston, Michigan",4

Mammoth Cave,"My wife and I toured Mammoth Cave on the ""Extended Historic"" and ""Domes and Dripstones"" tours. HERE'S THE BIGGEST TIP WE CAN GIVE: BUY YOUR TOUR TICKETS BEFORE GETTING TO MAMMOTH CAVE. It's a busy place and if you want to see what you want to see; tickets purchased ahead will make your visit fabulous as you won't have to wait for a tour, or not be able to get in to a guided trip. As we were welcomed by Jim & Dave (who were fabulous) everyone on the tour was informed that if you have claustrophobic tendencies, this might not be the trip for you. I have had some issues with tight spaces since a childhood event involving my older brother, his friends and a small wood box in which I found myself, while they were sitting on top. Enough nostalgia, thanks to my tremendous wife informing me that kids were on our tour, and people are doing this every day, we went in to the caves. After an uncomfortable 3-4 minutes to start (with a lot of prayers and quiet hymn singing), we were continually astounded by the beauty and history shared by our wonderful guides. It is fascinating to walk in unique places where folks have been walking and exploring for thousands of years. We toured about 4-5 caves in our time at Mammoth but, the National Park was truly memorable. Now, I also don't seem to mind small spaces as much, unless I'm travelling with my brother.","August 14, 2019",Claustrophobi-WoW!,15,"Matthews, North Carolina",5
Mammoth Cave,We had a great time at Mammoth Cave National Park. We walked the short path while killing time for the 2 hr Historic tour. There is an exhibit inside as well to go through to learn more about Mammoth Caves. The Historic tour is great! It does require a fair bit of walking and ducking in places. I am 6 ft 1 and 180 lbs. Fat Man's Misery was no problem at all. All the end there are a fair number of stairs to climb up to get out. But there are places to stop and rest if needed.

Mammoth Cave,"I have lived in Northern Kentucky/Greater Cincinnati my whole life and it took me 32 years to finally check out Mammoth Cave. This is an awesome place for all ages, with cave tours ranging from simple 1/2 hour tours to hardcore all day spelunking tours. Just be sure to book in advance online, as tours sell out pretty quick. The one we really wanted was already sold out 3 weeks before we went, but the two tours we took were both excellent. Stay in nearby Cave City if you don't want to camp in the park. It is a quiet town with good restaurants and that quaint Central Kentucky charm. Overall, this is a fun and exciting place and an excellent National Park.

Mammoth Cave,"I'm glad I read reviews and made reservations. When I booked them 2 days in advance in mid Aug. (on a weekday), there were 10 spots left on the 4 hr Grand Avenue Tour (and many of the shorter and less strenuous tours were already sold out). I was dismayed by the number of people who were loaded into the buses at the start of our tour (at least 80), and I was dreading not being able to hear the ranger. No fear. The entire group gathers several times during the tour for a short talk on what to expect ahead, and/or a bathroom break. I was very happy to see that the ranger would answer questions until everyone was seated or standing, and then begin their presentation in a volume that everyone could hear. You are encouraged to keep in sight of the person in front of you, but at times, the pace was quite brisk, and it was hard to appreciate the scope and beauty of your surroundings. At other times, we'd all catch up to each other at bottlenecks like staircases or steep downslopes. My favorite areas were the ""slot canyons"".I can understand the need to keep everybody moving, to accommodate the other tours coming through later, but overall, it felt rushed. I'm glad we toured Mammoth Cave, and used the 4 mile hike as our exercise for the day, but we probably won't be back. Now Carlsbad Caverns? We'd definitely go there again, as you can walk through on your own, go at your own pace, and the formations are jaw dropping, and never ending!","August 12, 2019",Make reservations if you want to do ANY tour!,224,"Mount Juliet, Tennessee",4

Mammoth Cave,"Visited recently with my husband, 6 year old son and mother. We took almost all of the cave tours they offer, stayed for a full week in the area. I could not have left with a better opinion of this park. Touring these caves has been one of my favorite vacations so far.*When they say that you probably should not take this tour if you are claustrophobic, they mean it! I don't have the issue but many people on these tours panicked in certain spots.*Similarly, there are many tours that would be very difficult If you do not like heights. The stairs are totally worth it, but you can see ALL the way down in most cases.*I am a larger sized person and even though some areas were tight, I did not encounter anywhere that I did not 'fit'.*The only thing you can bring into the caves is water. Do not bring food or anything else.*BOOK AHEAD. Ill say that again.. BOOK AHEAD. They are very good about cancellations/changes so book ahead. Else you will see the daily tours sell out. They did days in advance, even on the weekdays, while we were there. *If the tours sell out, the self guided is usually offered. Especially for the price, its completely worth it to still take this one.*The park itself, outside of the caves has so much to do. *The gifts shops in the visitor center and attached hotel have so much to offer, they are almost worth a trip themselves.","August 12, 2019",Absolute Must See!!

There were 2 places to stop and use the restroom, also there were an additional 2 spots the guide stopped to talk to us about the history, etc. it really did go faster than you would think. Also, you finish at the frozen Niagara area, which is definitely the highlight of it! Know you limitations, as some places were slippery and difficult to navigate. However there was a couple, she was 90% blind and he was limited physically as they were in their 80’s. They were slower than the group and had some difficulty in areas, but they did the whole tour! If they can do it, you can! Note, there are some areas that are about 2 ft wide or less. An obese person would have difficulty in certain spaces. There were about 80 ppl in the tour but it wasn’t overcrowded, surprisingly. It’s around mid 50’s in the be, so bring a sweatshirt and have good sneakers or hiking boots that grip.","August 9, 2019",Amazing experience,5,,5
Mammoth Cave,I did the domes and dripstones tour. (Actual time in cave = about an hour and 15 minutes) There were lots of warnings about how strenuous it would be and yes there are lots of stairs down at the beginning but it didn’t feel like there were that many coming out the other end. The rangers were friendly but I felt we could have been given more information at the stops. The end part is the best and most beautiful and I highly recommend doing the “optional” 45 steps down and back again to visit the “drapery room” below the Frozen Niagara part. Overall worth doing but not as amazing as I had expected.

Mammoth Cave,"I was a wee bit disappointed with the tours we took. While we got to see a lot, we just walked RIGHT through it, hardly stopping at all. There was no time to take photos or just drink in the sights! We did the Historical Extended at 9 AM (I highly recommend to go first thing in the morning before it gets more crowded--we had less children too) and also the Domes & Dripstones. I was sad that I went through most of it watching my feet in the semi-darkness rather than looking up. HIGHLY RECOMMEND the DISCOVERY TOUR, as this is self-guided. This means you can stroll and look to your heart's content. If we had time, we would have added this tour after the others--covers a small part of what we had already seen, but we would have been able to look around more. (this one can't be reserved; tickets have to be bought on the day. But the other tours we did reserve 2 weeks ahead of time). Also: the park does a good job scaring the liver out of you that you won't be able to take the level of difficulty, but it was definitely hyped up a bit. I almost didn't do the Domes & Dripstones after reading the description, but it was fine.BTW, this whole area has many privately owned caves too. I would love to spend a few more days there and go into every cave available! I suspect the crowds would be much smaller, and it might be more personal too.","August 8, 2019","Very Nice, But Quick-Moving",26,western PA,4

The park itself offers camping with trails throughout. Upon arriving at the very nice visitor center we noticed that there were a lot of people visiting the cave. It was a Saturday and all of the tours for the day were sold out except for the self guided tour. We decided to do that tour which cost $6.00 per person. On the self guided tour you get to pretty much tour on your own. However, you do not get to see any of the domes, dripstones and varous formations. Pretty much on the self guided tour you see the massive size of the cave and some rock formations. If you get cold easily you may want to bring a jacket. It took us about 40 minutes to do the self guided tour. If you wish to take the guided tours conducted by Park Rangers you can book in advance. Suggest to to that especially during the busy summer months.","July 31, 2019",Big Crowded Cave,6,,3
Mammoth Cave,"We walked the Grand Avenue Tour which was amazing because of how big that cave truly is but, although our tour guide was very knowledgeable, she talked way too much. We were at the end of the group and by the time we reached the Frozen Niagara which was the high point of the whole trip, Ranger Ryan pushed us through saying the buses were leaving we had to hurry....disappointing not to be able to get photos when you spend so much for tickets.","July 31, 2019",Rushed through the best part,1,,3
Mammoth Cave,"We met up with friends here who had been doing a National park RV trip. Luckily I bought our tickets for a Monday Domes and Dripstones tour a few days before as many tours sold out. We got in on Sunday to meet up with our friends. They did the four hour tour, and they said it was a little long so they were excited for our two hour tour. The junior range booklets were out for them, so that was a disappointment as they had been collecting with their kids. I could not believe how busy it was nor how many tours were sold out for that day or the next. I would highly recommend getting your tickets in advance or if you have a few days here, scope out what you want and purchase for later in your trip. We came back on Monday when the park opened at 8 a.m. It was once again a frantic sight with many people saying they couldn't get the tour they wanted. We did many of the trails and enjoyed our time before the tour. Our tour guides was David and Shelia. We rode the bus (we needed three for the large group) had a brief orientation and then headed down the stairs. My main disappointment was not the cave itself, but our proximity to a tour guide to ask questions. We made one stop and we did not have many questions there. I also couldn't believe how many people were not following the rules--using flash photography, touching the walls, and one guy even tried to wander off on his own. Due to the groups large size, if you are in the back, you will fill rushed. We did see David and Shelia after our return and got to talk to them. They were very knowledgeable. I think smaller tour groups would be better. It is hard with it being a poplar destination. I would be aware and if you can, try to take a tour that has groups smaller than one hundred. We did get to do the junior ranger program and that had many great pieces of information. ","July 31, 2019","Crowded, but interesting",78,"Charlotte, North Carolina",3
Mammoth Cave,"We took 2 different tours with our 6 year old granddaughter. The first day we did the Domes and Dripstone tour which is 2 hours. The ranger giving the tour was knowledgeable but spent a lot of time telling us about how he had been in the navy and taught high school. We heard this at least 5 times. Too much time spent chatting that we were rushed at the end which was the prettiest part of the tour. The next day we did the historic tour which was much better but again rushed at the end. This tour made you appreciate the massive size of the cave. Impressed with size but as far as beauty, Blanchard Springs Cavern in Arkansas has this beat.","July 29, 2019",Rushed through at the end,35,"Mountain Home, Arkansas",3
Mammoth Cave,"We booked the 4 hour tour which was amazing to see. It was approximately 4 miles of walking and not all flat, there are some really steep hills you have to walk up. Some people in our group struggled with it even after being told in the beginning about it. The guide is very knowledgeable and you do stop to hear about the cave but at points are walking 30 minutes to your next destination in the cave. There were two bathroom breaks which was great. Bring long sleeve as it is cool in the cave. My kids are are 6 and 10 and did the whole tour with no issues or complaining. ","July 28, 2019",Awesome ,19,"Blandon, Pennsylvania",5
Mammoth Cave,For improving this national park I have a suggestion:Some gates must be at the entrance of the parking lot and visitors must be allowed to use their annual national park passes. There will be no long lines. In this way all ticket Officers will be laid off and save money from federal budget.Charging with additional fees shows that they want to make more money from this place.Currently cannot be used national annual pass - so frustrated!,"July 28, 2019",Annual National Park Pass does not work,74,Texas,1

Mammoth Cave,A word of caution - BRING A FLASHLIGHT. The caves are VERY poorly lit. This becomes dangerously apparent when walking on wet slippery rocks and climbing steps that you can not see. LED rope lights (at floor level) are a must to be installed along the paths. Once you get past that - these are some very fascinating caves to visit. The two best tours are the Historic Tour and the Drips and Domes tour. These are the only tours that do not overlap.,"July 27, 2019",So much to see,200,,5
Mammoth Cave,"Don’t waste your money. It’s a dull walk about 1/2 mile into the cave with no formations just to come to a dead end. I cannot vouch for the other tours..... they were all sold out.

Mammoth Cave,"This place is great. I took the Historic tour and The Domes and Dripstones. If you can only take one I would recommend the Domes and Dripstones. Their both great tours but I thought there was a little more formations to see and a few less stairs with the Domes and Dripstones. They will tell you from the beginning that the Historic tour has allot of stairs at the end and a narrow passage called the Fat Man's Misery. It is a little tight but accessible. I spent the whole day there with my wife from 9 am until 4:30 pm. We took a break between tours and had a bite to eat in the restaurant. Not cheap but a good distraction between tours. There's plenty of green space if you bring a cooler. If you know your going book your tours online. We arrived for the first tour of the day at 10 am and almost all the tours with the exception of a 2:45 Dripstone and the self guided tours were already sold out. If you have time at the end take a ride down by the Green River Ferry. An old time ferry across the river that can handle 3 cars at a time.

Mammoth Cave,Loved it. This was my kids' favorite part of a four-day road trip and for good reason. The 2-hour tour was long enough to not bore them and give them a basic understanding of the tour while entertaining them with some steeper sections and tight spaces. Would I recommend it for the completely out of shape? No. If you shop at Big & Tall (or even just Tall or just Big)? No. Those spaces were tight and the flights of stairs were long. I wouldn't even recommend it for people who are afraid of germs. One mother kept reminding her kids (roughly 10 -12 years old) to NOT hold the guard rail because of the germs. The steps were slippery from dripping water and they were steep. Telling children to not hold onto them was nuts. I told my kids to wash their hands afterwards.,"July 23, 2019",Historic tour was so fun,314,philadelphia area,5
Mammoth Cave,"The portion of the cave this tour takes place in is a great sight and there is lots of varied formations and areas to see. The tour itself? Not so much. I think they overbook it by about 3x. It's a two-hour tour which includes 10 minutes bus rides to and from the cave. With less people, I feel we could have covered more ground and learned a bit more about the cave. A lot of the time was spent waiting. How it's operated is with two rangers, one in front and one in back with about 120 people in the middle all going at their own pace. It's a lot of steps but didn't feel like the 300 they said it was going to be. I'm a little larger than average and had little trouble maneuvering through some tight spots. Some of the sights were awesome, but without being allowed flash photography it was hard to take pictures until the end. You might think to wear extra layers, but the cave is usually the same temperature year round and very humid so you'll probably work up a sweat.","July 23, 2019",Domes and Dripstones Tour,43,,3
Mammoth Cave,"After being encouraged to stop and see Mammoth Cave, our family was was amazed that something so unique and beautiful existed right here in the U.S. The largest cave system in the world, it is a nominal fee to choose one of a variety of tours to explore the caves.Self-guided Discovery Tours for $6 are usually available any time, but the specialty tours sell out...book early!

Mammoth Cave,"Knowing that we could not get tickets for other tours, (summertime crowds), we bought the Discovery Self Guided Tour ($6). We started our tour about 2pm. The visitor center is nice, the usual gift shops and interactive displays. We thought the staff member at ticket booth was not very customer service oriented. Her directions as to where to go and not giving us a map to the park was not appreciated. The self guided tour was a pretty easy hike, but we did see many people huffing and puffing due to the heat and inclines (walkway and 160 stairs). Once in the cavern, the air was cool and damp. We enjoyed going at our own pace and that time of the day wasn’t super crowded (Thursday 2-3pm). We have been to many caves in the past and this one was just ok. But I would guess that some of the other many tours offered were good. Just make sure to reserve way ahead of your trip!","July 19, 2019",Discovery Self Guided Tour,431,"Rockledge, Florida",3

Mammoth Cave,"We took the Historic Cave Tour and the Domes and Dripstones Tour. Both were fantastic as the Mammoth Cave is truly massive and awe inspiring. They weren't overly strenuous and had just enough slightly tight areas to make it interesting. The only complaint I have is the speed at which we were expected to go through. I barely had enough time to look around. I guess with 100+ people in the tour group, you have to keep folks moving. The ranger for the Domes and Dripstones tour was friendly and cheery. (sadly, I can't remember his name) The ranger for the Historic Tour was snide and sarcastic. Ranger Jim, your sarcasm was meant to be funny but it came across as mean spirited. Instead of imagining yourself as a bat on the wall of history, imagine yourself as a tourist on vacation seeing the cave for the first time. That may change your attitude a bit. Anyway, we loved the cave and the area so we heartily advise people to come experience it for yourself!!","July 18, 2019",Cave Tour,6,"Edenton, North Carolina, United States",5
Mammoth Cave,"We visited Mammoth Cave National Park with our three grandsons, ages 11, 9, and 6. What a great experience we had, enjoying the visitor center with exhibits and participating in two different cave tours. We chose the Gothic Avenue (two hours) and Frozen Niagara (75 minutes) tours, with 45 minutes in between to allow for a bathroom break and a snack. The tours were very different and both were extremely informative and interesting to the three boys and us grandparents. Some suggestions for a good visit:Plan ahead! Tours can be booked ahead on line and we did so a month before. Don’t overestimate your group’s ability or attention span.Although it was extremely hot when we visited, we did need sweatshirts for the cave tours.The video in the visitor center was very interesting- don’t miss it!We didn’t have time for hikes, but would have enjoyed them in cooler weather.Next time we’ll choose a few different tours!!","July 16, 2019",Amazing visit with grandsons,49,"Superior, Wisconsin",5
Mammoth Cave,"We came here to do an adventurous and educational trip with our two young children: 4 & 6. And to escape the heat! The cool temps of the cave were much welcome in the Kentucky July heat. It was reviews first and knew we had to book our tours in advance, and got the Domes and Dripstones as well as the Extended Historic Tour. Both were fabulous and very different. Domes and Dripstones (which enters from the new entrance) was a more difficult tour, physically speaking, but our guide did a fantastic job of pacing and making sure we were close to the front. Most of this tour was single file and even though there were a TON of people, it was just fine. There were many stairs and most were slippery from the dripping water, but the slow pace helped and my kids loved to count the “cave kisses” (water drips) and cave crickets. There are crickets and spiders on this part of the cave!The Extended Historic Tour goes in the original entrance and we could not believe how big the cave and passageways were!! Lots of stairs on this one but very informative and interesting. We felt like the ranger did really well at explaining the artifacts and history of the cave, and although our six year old got a little wiggly toward the end of the talks, we were moving soon enough. The only thing about this tour is that even though the ranger asked for those who would go at a slower pace should make their way to the front, we could never stay in the front due to other people on the tour pushing through or passing us. We actually enjoyed it even more staying in the back and chatting with the others and the ranger at the back. The Visitor’s Center was way better than I expected, with two stores, a full museum (free), and large and clean bathrooms. There is an ice cream place and a restaurant in the building behind the visitor’s center as well. I am so glad we did two different tours and got to see the cave in such different ways!

Both tours are fantastic and completely independent of the weather. Tour guides were friendly and knowledgeable. Wear pants and perhaps long sleeves, as the temperature is constantly in the 50s in the cave. The only drawback is that there is little else in the area to see or do, and you are kind of in the middle of nowhere, KY. Also keep in mind, especially coming from the east, Mammoth Cave is in Central Time Zone.","July 16, 2019",Very Unique Place,25,"Athens, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"We had not originally planned to visit Mammoth Cave, but had some extra time on our hands while driving back home and decided to stop and see if we could take one of the tours. Unlike some National Parks, there is no admission fee to get into the park, but there are charges to take the various cave tours. Most of the early tours were already booked up (we should have made reservations), but there was a self-guided tour that started about 45 minutes from the time we arrived, so we passed that time by touring the gift shops and walking through the exhibits located in the Visitor Center, which were interesting and informative. When we went through the line to get our tickets for the self-guided tour, we were surprised to learn that my Senior Pass, which we have used in the past for free admission to other National Parks for a carload of people, could only be used for a discount on MY ticket and not my wife's. The tour itself was enjoyable, although a fair bit of walking and climbing steps was necessary, so comfortable shoes are a must and the caves are considerably cooler that one might expect. This is our second trip here, but both have been short visits, so we need to come back when we can really spend some quality time exploring this unusual National Park.","July 16, 2019",Short visit,89,"Tuscaloosa, Alabama",4

My boyfriend and I took the Historic Tour of the cave. It was nice, but didn't meet the level of ""wow"" others had built up about it. Our guide was funny and engaging, and the information he provided was interesting. There were A LOT of people though, so it kind of took some of the magic out of the experience (which we understand because it is such a popular destination, and tours sell out super fast).

We had some very good commentary from Ranger Jonathan, but most of the time was just walking through paved semi-darkness. I don’t blame the Park Service.

It sits alongside the Green River which you can view from several trails, but there is no swimming in the park or anywhere near it. We did the Violet City Lantern Cave Tour which we suggest to families with older kids that can do a three mile walk. We had an incredible guide, Ranger Jerry, whose family has served the park in many ways since the 1800s. He was knowledgeable, kind and a great story teller. He made the history of the cave come alive! The museum inside the Visitor Center is interactive and well thought out. It engages kids and adults alike! There’s a short video to watch as well. Also, there is a water bottle fill station next to the water fountain (just outside of indoor restrooms). Rangers are on hand and available to answer any questions. All were friendly! There are two well stocked gift shops. The VC is just across the walkway from The Lodge at Mammoth Cave which we recommend because it’s in the park and just a walk away from the Visitor Center, Historic Cave entrance and many trails. We stayed two nights and it was the perfect amount of time for us. One day we walked the trails and the other day we did the cave tour. Visit this park - you’ll be glad you did!

Mammoth Cave,"We've been driving by this exit for years on our road trips and finally decided to stop and check it out. The park was very lush and green, we saw a turkey on the drive in, and this National Park doesn't have an entrance fee. We did the self guided tour and that was fine for us. Since this is a dry cave there are not a lot of water features like stalagmites, but the entrance waterfall is quite beautiful. The walk down the hill and stairs might be tough for those with knee issues.The history of the cave and its mining and mushroom past was interesting. If you've been to other caves, you will most likely not be overly impressed with this one, but it's still worth a visit to immerse yourself in nature. Had we more time, we would have hiked the grounds. Make sure you try and shop the first gift shop to the right of the entrance as that is the one where all profits go back to the national parks. That gift shop is also where the passport stamp station is. Well run, friendly staff, would go back again to hike if in the area.","July 13, 2019",Great respite from the heat,32,Texas,4

On the 4th, we managed to get into a tour that was added at the last minute due to high demand, an abbreviated version of the historic tour. We are anxious to visit again, having booked every tour in advance. They say there are over 400 miles of mapped cave and I hope new tours into new areas are developed. We also hiked a few of the trails in the park and they are well-kept and beautiful. My favorite was hiking down the hill and past the historic entrance.

There are 2 restaurants on site. One is a grab and go and ice cream stand. The other is a sit down grill which looks nice. Great gift shop (the main one in the lobby) that supports the park services.

Mammoth Cave,"This was another park that we weren’t sure what we were going to get with it. We had bought tickets for the Gothic Ave your first thing in the morning(if you are going to visit, go to the website and purchase your tickets for tours before you go, if you wait, chances are they will be sold out). Once we arrived at the visitor center we went to the will call and picked up our tickets for the tour. We had a time to meet the ranger at a shelter, they explain things and then off to the cave you go. The cave was really awesome. The ranger did a great job during the entire tour. This made me want to comeback for other cave tours at Mammoth. Above ground there are numerous hiking trails that can be done as well. Really wonderful place.

I called ahead and the lady said get in my car and drive as long as I could make it by 3 we would be fine. I thought sold out it would be crowded but to my surprise we were nearly alone in the cave. It was chilly so bring a light jacket if u are cold blooded. I thought it felt great. I will definitely be going back to go on a more adventurous trip. Worth 6 dollars.,"July 3, 2019",Worth the trip,7,,5
Mammoth Cave,"We did not get to the cave until mid-afternoon. By then, all the tours were already done. We bought the self-guided tour which was relatively cheap. Unfortunately, you only get to go into one basic cave that probably isn't close to the best one. If you want to make a quick stop and go inside a cave, then you will be happy. if you truly want to go inside a MAMMOTH cave, then get there in the morning.","July 3, 2019",Go early,49,Tennessee,3

Mammoth Cave,"Working on our bucket list and hitting another National Park. The area is beautiful. We drove through some rain to get there and, quite frankly, the area has been slammed with rain and that made for such a lush and green landscape as you arrived at the park. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon and there were a fair amount of people here however, I have seen mobs of people at other parks and virtually no parking. Parking lots were crowded but parking was available. Obviously, you will want to go on one of the cave tours. These tours should be booked prior to your arrival. People come and go all day at this park and you may or may not be able to get tickets to a tour that works with your time constraints. We chatted with a few folks who were driving through and only had a couple of hours to spend at the NP. Unfortunately, they could not get the tickets they wanted to a cave tour. There is a self guided tour which is available from 9 - 3. This is a good way to get an idea of the massiveness of this cave. But this too should be reserved prior to your arrival. We were fortunate to get tickets for this the day prior to our visit. Just got lucky. We had purchased tickets, on-line, for a different tour about 6 weeks prior to our visit. For us two tours were enough. If you are afraid of the dark, or tight spaces or being underground, you may want to limit your time doing those things. I personnally have issues with all three and felt that the two tours we took gave us a good enough understanding of the caves. But you can take a 4 hour tour and I commend all of you that do that. Above ground there are trails that take you through beautiful trees and scenic views. Mosquitos can be annoying so be prepared. Water should be with you at all times. It can be very hot and you don't want to risk dehydration. This NP is a great place. It is another one of the wonders of the United States that our predecessors had the sense to earmark as a National Park and preserve for future generations.","July 1, 2019",A Natural Wonder,90,,5

Mammoth Cave,"You must plan ahead if you want to tour the caves. Tours sell out quickly. We wanted an easier tour Frozen Niagara but they were all sold out so Domes and Dripstones it was.... We had people in our group with knee problems , claustrophobia issues and other health issues and we did just fine. Walking sticks for those who need help can be a good idea though there are parts of the tour you would not be able to use them because of the tight spaces. The Rangers/guides were extremely nice and encouraging once we arrived at the cave entrance and some of the people were having issues going down in the cave. There were 100 people in our group which seems like a lot but it worked fine. If you are claustrophobic get in the front or the back of the group. There are two breaks in the tour were you sit and listen to the Ranger talk about the caves. This gives those that need time to catch their breath a nice 10/15 minute break if you are at the front of the group. We enjoyed the tour and were glad we did it. The grounds are nice around the park and would have liked to have explored all that was there....maybe next time.

As for kids, my 7 year old went and was fine, but I would figure anything younger than 5 or 6 would be bad, especially if they want to be carried after standing or walking for long distances.

Mammoth Cave,"As soon as my husband and I knew we were going to visit the Mammoth Cave National Park we checked out their website. We were able to obtain much needed information about the many tours they offer. After much consideration we decided we’d do the Domes and Dripstones tour which is a two hour, ¾ mile tour with many steps but we felt, even as seniors, we were up for the challenge! The two hour tour isn’t exactly two hours inside the cave; there is a short bus ride included to get you to the entrance of this particular tour. The descent into the cave is where the majority of the steps are and it is a bit narrow but not impossible to navigate. Once you get past this point the rest of the steps throughout the tour are much more manageable. Our tour guide (leader) and his assistant who brought up the rear were great. Although our leader had idle chit chat with the folks that got down ahead of the slower paced individuals, he was very courteous to patiently wait for all members to catch up to one another before beginning his main talk. My husband and I have been on many cave tours but we think this tour had many more people on it than we had ever encountered anywhere before. Perhaps that is because the caves are so massive. Personally we did not feel there were any problems but can understand how other reviewers may think otherwise. The sights inside the cave on our tour were impressive but we’re sure that there are many others that are even more spectacular. We also know first hand that there are many other cave systems that pale in comparison. Enjoy it for the sheer creative amazement for what it’s worth. Lastly, I’d like to mention that we did make reservations for this tour in advance since we were going during the summer. The place does get crowded and can get sold out of many tours. We didn’t want to travel all that distance to be disappointed.","June 15, 2019",We thoroughly enjoyed!,44,"East Windsor, New Jersey",5

The huge tall ceilings & the shapes within are amazing. Lots of history & shapes in the Rotunda room & beyond on the Extended Historic Tour. The massive shapes on the Dome/Dripstones Tour were awesome. There are a lot of stairs involved with both. Lots of up & down. Definitely a work out at times. Small low areas to fit through as well. Great tour guides on both tours. Jackie & Eric on Ex-Historic tour & Stephen & Elizabeth on the D/D’s tour. Well worth the time. We’ve done many caves across the US and I believe these are my favorites & the most different. These 2 tours covered a wide range of what there is to see. Mammoth Park itself is large & we took some lovely rides through it. The lodge & campgrounds looked nice from a distance.

Sons and i fished a bit by the ferry crossing. Shoreline opportunities were few. Next time we will rent canoes (off site venders) and drift it.

Mammoth Cave,"Bottom line: tours allow too many people for the guides to control, especially when many different groups (of all ages) want to be problematic. This made it very difficult to enjoy the cave and the tour. Do yourself and others a favor, if you or your friends/children are not REALLY interested, don't go on a 2-4 hour cave tour. It was evident a large number of people could not be less interested in being there.Side notes: it's 54 degrees inside. Dress accordingly. Many were unhappily cold for several hours wearing shorts and/or tank tops. Also, plan ahead as some tours sell out a week+ in advance.We booked 2 tours online; Grand Adventure and Historic. Grand Tour: 4 hours is a long time to be trapped underground with a variety of very unpleasant people. It was miserable solely due to about 30 of the 80 guests being rude, disrespectful, and ignoring rules (shining cell phone flashlights in other people's eyes, touching special features in the cave, climbing on rocks off the trail, getting off trail). The guide had to reprimand several different people at every stop. He was great, but couldn't police everyone while we were walking. And it's 3+ hours of just walking. Several were shoving, pushing (think Black Friday meets road rage - and the cave is slippery in many places). Others were carrying on loud conversations while the tour guide was talking. Way too many people were being disruptive, being uncooperative, complaining and whining loudly about how miserable or cold they were, and the list goes on. Re Cave: The best parts were the slot canyon and Niagra. Historic Tour: had 110 people on tour. The guide was great/funny. But it was way too crowded. Felt like queue line at a theme park. Re Cave: The best parts were Rotunda (large room) and the Dome. If you can figure out how to do a tour with fewer people - the cave would be a great experience. However, it may prove hard. For example the day before our tours, both only had about 30 people each. The day of, the both sold out.","June 4, 2019","Tours too crowded 80-110 people = hard to control.

Mammoth Cave,"We took the historic tour. It was just ok. Most of it was walking along in wide cavernous rooms with not much to see - dry, not wet - so none of the typical cave formations. Then it switches to narrow passages with lots of ducking. There is a snake like passage called “fat mans misery” that is tedious to manage even if you’re in good shape. There is a neat water feature near the end. I enjoyed the ranger guide and learned some interesting history of the mining that occurred in the cave. If I ever go back I’d do a specialty tour instead of this one; But this was a good introduction to the caves. We didn’t have time to explore any of the outdoor hiking trails but from what we could see the forest in this area was lush and full so the trails are probably nice.","June 1, 2019",Historic tour,0,"Fishersville, United States",3
Mammoth Cave,"We loved our trip! We bought our tickets on Sunday for Thursday and Friday, and one tour was nearly already sold out. We booked 3 tours. We did the Grand Avenue Tour first. It is 4 miles of speed-walking, climbing, side-stepping, slipping, sliding terrain. It was great, but we wondered sometimes how much more there was. There were restroom and water breaks on this tour though! We did the Extended Historic the next day. It was great. You will do climbing, but nothing to the magnitude or terrain of the Grand Avenue. And there are many interesting sights to see. The inside of this cave is massive, but there are tights spots you will have to lean over or bend for. We did the Violet Lantern tour last. It is 3-miles, but it was by far, the most relaxed. We loved our trip!! We could have done the self-guided Tour, but you can only sign up for it that day for $6/person; and we saw most/some of it on the Extended Historic. We stayed in Cave City which is an easy 15-minute drive. We are so glad we did this.

Mammoth Cave,"Overall, this was very disappointing tour. It is labeled as being 2 hours, but that includes the bus ride to the entrance and then back to the visitor center. This is a pretty rigorous hike too--lots of steps (many of them as you first walk in--those are steep and all going down through very narrow areas) and also many steep inclines. It is pretty dark most of the time--about movie theater lighting. Not much to see until the end where there are interesting formations. If you are wanting to take pictures, good luck--there is no stopping on this tour except in 2 rooms which really have nothing to take pictures of. Also no flash pictures allowed. We only had about 40 people on our tour (it accomodates over 100) but still the guide started talking about things before everyone caught up to him. So basically only the people in front got the full information. The rangers were nice, but honestly, the only thing exciting about this cave is that it's big. Also--most cave tours we've gone on before tell you to bring a jacket because the temperature tends to be in the 50's. There were people wearing shorts and t-shirts on this tour. It really isn't cold--especially by the time you get down all the steps at the beginning!","May 29, 2019",Domes & Dripstones tour,17,"Mansfield, Ohio",2
Mammoth Cave,"We drove about 3 hours to see the park. We were able to get into the Domes & Dripstones and Historic Tours for Sunday. We did buy these online about a week ahead of time. Both of the tours we took were sold out, which meant about 120 people in the group. It was too many for us. They said this is more common on weekends and especially holiday weekends. The tours were good. We stayed towards the front. Tegan for Domes and Dripstones was excellent. There is a bus ride to get there. There is a one-person-wide staircase down a long way. Parts of it are very narrow or you have to duck to get through. There are some neat dripstone areas in the stairwell portion. There are 3 stops in cave like rooms, mostly rocks. The last part has Niagara Falls which is a large dripstone and very pretty. Walk down to the drapery room at the end if you can. I'm generally very cold natured. I took a long sleeve T-shirt and was fine. The historic tour was good. The group was so large it was largely just walking along. This trail has pavement (or stairs) nearly the whole way. There is some neat smoke writing on the ceilings from long ago. Fat Man's misery is neat but tight even for an average girl. This tour mostly takes you trough a rock, dry cave. It is large and impressive but not necessarily beautiful. I enjoyed learning about the history. We did a little hiking around the visitors center. We also went for a mile onto the Great Onyx Cave road but saw nothing & turned around. We drove down to were Floyd Collins was buried at the Mammoth Cave Baptist church graveyard. We were able to see the cave where he died (entrance), not near the church. There were more places to hike in the park but the ferry is closed AND it was a hot weekend so we didn't hike as much as we'd liked. We did one of the back porch 3:00 ranger talks. It was interesting and about 10 min long. The visitor center is nice. There is another building across the bridge with food and stores too. Beware that there is only one National Park Store in the Visitors Center if you like to get genuine NPS gear. There is a post office near the visitor center and a camp store.

Important to note that you still have to check in and get actual tickets, even with reservations. We did the Extended Historic Tour and the Domes and DripstonesTour. Our tour rangers were great, very knowledgeable. The groups were large but I don't feel like we missed anything. The two tours were very different so that was nice! We hiked most of the trails around the visitor center and took the Green River ferry over the river. I was scared at first but I would highly recommend that experience! Clean, well managed park. Great experience!","May 9, 2019",Beautiful National Park,60,"Des Moines, Iowa",5
Mammoth Cave,"We booked a 2 hour tour online to avoid disapointment. You will have to arrive 30 mins before to Pick up tickets. On some tours you have bus transfer to the caves.

Mammoth Cave,"Our daughter and her husband gave this to my husband for a birthday present. They rented 2 cabins, and scheduled 3 tours through the cave. The first day we did the 4 mile Grand View hike. It had some difficult areas but we loved the tour. The second day we took a morning 2 mile historical hike. In the afternoon we did the 3 mile lantern hike. All the tours were awesome and our tour guides we all very knowledgeable and helpful. It was our first time being in a dry cave and was impressive in size. They told us they have discovered 412 miles of cave and of that amount 12 miles are available to the public. We hike 9 of the 12 miles. The lodge offers two areas to purchase things and there are two restaurants available on site. We ate there several times and enjoyed the selection. The cabins were 1 bedroom with a bathroom. They had a refrigerator and a coffee maker but no microwave. The rooms were comfortable enough but they definitely need an upgrade. In our bathroom the floor around the water pipe was open to the elements underneath so we had a snail and a couple of crickets that came into our room. The curtains on the windows were ridiculous and were missing several hooks. They were very hard to open and close them across the window. The outside of the cabin needs painting. Our daughters cabin was worse than ours. For the $99 a night to rent they need to be updated. I will say the location of our cabins was lovely and convenient to the caves.

Mammoth Cave,"We stayed for two days in cabins through the INN. It was private, spacious, and very a surprisingly clean. Typically with a cabin you expect dirt or mold but it was very clean and comfortable. The cave tours were amazing. Time passed by extremely fast. We took the longer tours and somehow we found ourselves wishing we could have gone a slower walking pace, not due to being able to keep up with the Rangers but more to be able to take everything in. Its an unbelievable cave system but you seem to just walk on past alot.","May 7, 2019",Definitely recommend the trip!,0,,5
Mammoth Cave,"We took the historic tour which takes about 2hrs. Fortunately I read other reviews and we got near the tour lead. He gave interesting talks at each of the stops but those who were not close by missed all the interesting details while walking between stops. The ones at the end of the group missed out on information while the group gathered at stops as well. Our group was about 100 people, 25 would be a better maximum size. If you take the tour make a reservation and get near the front for maximum enjoyment. I would rate 5 stars if the group was smaller. ","May 7, 2019",Tour Group too large,6,"Tucson, Arizona",4
Mammoth Cave,"We took a side trip here while we were visiting Nashville (it’s only a 1 1/2 hour drive). So happy we did! There were four adults in our group and we did the Domes and Dripstones Tour. This is a two hour tour that involves over 400stairs and a walk that I believe is 3/4 of a mile. They warn you plenty prior to the tour that if you are afraid of tight spaces or have difficulty with stairs this may not be the best tour for you. Please follow these advisories! One woman on our tour had difficulty seeing due to macular degeneration and had knee problems which really limited her mobility. We were all honestly shocked she made it through the tour. I would definitely not recommend a tour for someone with those types of physical limitations. Our guide told us recent rescue for a visitor with knee problems took 8 1/2 hours! While I’m claustrophobic I did not have any issues with the tour although it is very snug in places. I would have to duck down and fit into some parts of the path sideways. I know my limits and knew the spelunking tour would be too much for me with my claustrophobic tendencies. Although we enjoyed the entirety of the tour, the end is by far the highlight. Lots of formations at the end. This is a dry cave so there are fewer formations than some of the others we have visited such as Jewel Cave National Monument. But Niagara Falls is spectacular! After our tour we visited the historic tour entrance for some photos and picnicked at a pond. I wish we had had more time to explore the rest of the park because there seemed to be some nice trails and interesting history. The visitor center is also very well done with many displays park information.","May 6, 2019",So Awesome!,25,"San Francisco, California",5
Mammoth Cave,"We did the Grand Avenue hike. It was 4 hours long and somewhat strenuous, mainly a lot of stair steps and uphill stepping, but not really hard - no climbing or crawling required.","May 6, 2019",Well Worth The Visit,21,"Lake Orion, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"Huge caves- the ""Mammoth"" says it all! We took the Frozen Niagara trip with the National Park Rangers. We were taken by bus from the Mammoth Cave Visitor's Center to the (artificial) entrance to the Frozen Niagara entrance. The Rangers were a treasure of information and the trip was quite painless even for the young kids in our party. A good visit. Now I will admit to bias as a Virginia who has been to Luray Caverns multiple times. If cave formations and draperies are your thing, Luray has Mammoth Caves beaten hands down. Even Frozen Niagara, the ""prettiest"" part of Mammoth Caves, can't compare to Luray. But Luray is small compared to the sheer size of Mammoth Caves!","May 6, 2019","The ""Mammoth"" in the name says a lot!",107,"Vienna, Virginia",4
Mammoth Cave,"The cave was beautiful in it's own way, but doesn't have many of the more scenic formations that many cave visitors might expect. This cave is very impressive in it's scale! We took 2 tours, and although they were worth taking, both felt rushed. Visitors were specifically told these were NOT photographic tours and that they should not stop to take photos. The grand avenue tour is very strenuous and has numerous difficult hills. If you have any physical difficulties, DO NOT take this tour. Some of the hills have 30% or steeper grades. Although the historic tour was less physically demanding, it was a very large tour with many small children, which made it often difficult to hear the rangers narration. Overall, we enjoyed the tours but would have appreciated a less rushed experience.","April 29, 2019",We took the historic and grand avenue tours,16,,4
Mammoth Cave,"We are a 65 year old couple who stopped here during a road trip. We carefully considered whether to embark on this 2 hour, 2.5 mile trek underground, especially after hearing the warnings from the ranger at the beginning. But we gave it a shot and were glad we did. Some of the passages were challenging physically, but no one was rushed, and there were two rest stops along the way. We were tired, but fine.

Mammoth Cave,"This review is only for the Frozen Niagara Tour. It is great for older people who have limitations and people with smaller kids. We reserved our time online and thought the tour would be over an hour long. That was not the case. We spent more time on a bus and listening to the rangers than the actual tour. We maybe spent 20-30 minutes actually in the cave. We wished we had done a different tour, but didn’t have time for another. We will have to come back.

Mammoth Cave,"My first trip to Mammoth Cave was about a year ago. I did the Grand Avenue tour, which was excellent. It is a 4 mile hike. The first 2 miles were pretty easy. The last 1-2 miles get a little more hilly and steep. I enjoyed it so much I had to come back again...this time with my mom. We did the Violet City Lantern Tour. It was a different experience from Grand Avenue not only in that it goes through a different part of the cave, but the entire hike is only by lantern light. There is no electricity in that part of the cave, unlike Grand Avenue which is lit. Our guide on the Grand Avenue tour talked more about the formation of the cave. Violet City had more to do with the history. Both were fascinating. I would recommend either. There are some steep hills on the Violet City tour and they don't have hand rails, so wear shoes with good tread.","April 26, 2019",Cave Tours,12,"Atlanta, Georgia",5
Mammoth Cave,"If you like extreme sports and activities the Wild Tour is the one for you. We crawled, climbed, shimmied our way through spots that the majority of the tourist will never see. Plan on getting dusty and wet and having a blast. There are rests and walking between ""obstacles"" so you are not in a strenuous trek the entire time. Chris, Jackie and Tim were wonderful guides and I would go back with them in a heartbeat. IF you are not sure if extreme caving is for you, please do not sign up. Your hesitation on ""obstacles"" or desire to stay dry will impact the entire group and what can be accomplished.

Mammoth Cave,"Your tour guide can make or break this experience, I believe, while some of the cave tours are much more interesting than others. Over two days last week we did three different tours: Onyx Cave Lantern tour (excellent); the Historic Cave tour (good); and Domes and Dripstones (forgettable; I'd pass on this one).Onyx Cave only happens one month a year--it's part of the Mammoth experience but the cave is not yet physically connected to the main cave system. You ride a bus quite a distance to get there--the opening is a bit claustrophobic, but by lantern-light (there is no lighting system in the cave), it's fun. Lots of stalagmites and -tites to see, winding passages and canyons. Our guide, Shannon, was wonderful--right blend of facts and folklore. We only had about 20 people on this tour--fantastic.The Historic Tour had many more people, about 100(?), and again, Ranger Eric was fun--good at what he does, lots of information about the history of Mammoth Cave.For the third adventure, we rode three buses full of people to another entrance and this time, Guide S....n, could not control the crowd, couldn't be heard over the noise, CONSTANTLY struggled over words and sentences--just simply awful. The crowd was dominated by Asian visitors, who talked constantly in loud voice, touched the stalagtites and stalagmites numerous times, were constantly off the designated paths and ruined the experience for most of us. The group was so huge that we constantly waited for several minutes at stops for the rest of the group to catch up. The tour itself is uninteresting until you get to Frozen Niagara, near the end of the tour. If we had gone on this one first, I doubt we would have done the others.Do not miss the video in the Visitor's Center. It's on a continuous loop and last several minutes--very interesting!I did the walk to Dixon Cave and although you can't go in it, the trail around the mountain is interesting and pretty.","April 16, 2019",Tours of Mammoth Cave: A Mixed Bag,520,"Williamsburg, Virginia",4

Mammoth Cave,We only were able to do one tour and decided on the history tour. This tour is cool because it highlights the most historical and well known sections of the cave. Fat man's misery I think was probably the highlight of the tour.There are very few stalagmites and stalagtites in this section of the cave and the tour was set up so that we would stop and listen to the guide for very long periods of time then move on to the next session. When we were moving we were going pretty fast and I feel like we missed a lot and when we stopped the guide talked for a long time and this was difficult for my young son because we weren't moving.Overall I am very happy we got to see the most infamous section of the cave but I am also kind of wishing we did domes and dripstones instead.,"April 13, 2019",Features during history tour were great.

Mammoth Cave,"We went to the cave with reservations fortunately and took the morning historic tour. Our grandsons are 7 and 9 and had never been in a cave. The beginning of the tour was very good as the ranger went over a number of things we needed to know. Once we entered the cave however, the group was very large and it was difficult to keep up with the ranger. If you didn't push and shove to get to the front as some did, the rest of us couldn't hear anything the ranger said until we got to a stopping point and he was already talking. The group was too large. It needs to be cut in half or change the way the tour is done. I could have done this tour myself as self guided.

Mammoth Cave,"The caves are amazing, and worth the hassle. Just don't expect a friendly tour. (See my review of Crystal Onyx for a more family friendly adventure.) We went on a few tours over 2 days, but the rangers were all extremely dissatisfied with life, and apparently hate happiness. And small children.  I noticed right away that none of the staff was smiling. They all seemed very inconvenienced by the mere presence of guests on the property - And it wasn't that busy!  Our tour guide was very short with people who asked questions, and mocked a child who asked about a formation. The child was suggesting how a formation was made (it was cute) and the guide made SURE to let he kid know that HE was there EVERY DAY and KNEW how all the forms were made. (Good to know this turd of a guide apparently bore witness to the past millennia on a daily basis and clearly made accurate documented accounts of every drip. *eye roll*) They ask you not to touch the cave walls, which is logical... But our guides LOVED shouting at people who got too close to the walls.  The guides had a bit of a ""Cool Guy"" complex. They clearly know that the people they bring into the caves are at their mercy, and capitalize on this to make themselves feel like The Boss.  Best advice is to book tours WAY in advance, and if possible, go pick up your tickets a day ahead of time. Enjoy the amazing caverns, and don't let yourself be bothered by the rudeness of the staff.","April 5, 2019","Unfriendly Staff, Views are Worth it!",6,"Zeeland, Michigan",2

Mammoth Cave,"We finally visited this National Park after talking about it for years. We went on the Domes and Dripstones tour with Ranger Ted. They warn you about it being strenuous but it really isn’t. It is, however, pretty tight in some spots. Lots of winding stairs and some slippery spots. This portion of the cave is very interesting and the last part features a large number of stalagtites and stalagmites. It’s about 2 hours long which was just right. Ranger Ted did a great job with a lot of information with a little bit of humor. The busses that take you to the entrance were almost brand new and the whole park is immaculate. Well stocked gift shops and ample parking. Some have said it’s hard to find the visitors center and gps will take you to the wrong place. We didn’t find that at all.

The park offers several tours- you should take a guided tour to get history and information about the caves. The tours book up, so buy tickets in advance. There are also several nice areas to walk around the ground level of the park :) The only reason that I didn't give this park an excellent rating was due to the accommodations available. The ""lodge"" looks like an old elementary school and the rooms available are either motel-like rooms or cabins. In comparison to other national parks, I was disappointed in the accommodations.

Mammoth Cave,"It is an engineering feat to get the 250+ stairs put in place so well that they easily carry down 100 people down into the cave. Unfortunately that was the best part of our tour. There are 2 points that the whole group stops to listen to the ranger talk for a few minutes. They expect to move you through the tour in 2 hours which means that you are either catching up or waiting on the rest of the group. I felt rushed between those 2 points, the terrain is rough enough that you need to pay attention where you are walking so difficult to walk and gawk at the same time. Our group had some rowdy children and teenagers that made it hard to hear. And our ranger was young and seemed to be new to the tour. It is a wonder to see; just set your expectations appropriately.

It kept his interest the entire hour. He seemed very excited having never been in a cave before. He walked all the way down the steps to the foot of the Frozen Niagara formation.

We really enjoyed the tour and the guide was very good. He provided us with interesting history and it was nice that he waited until everyone caught up with each other before he started giving his presentation. I would have given this tour a 5 other than we didn't like that the group was so large (I think it was 110 people).

We arrived, found a free parking space, free as in available and no cost, and set out on a short 2.5 mile trail that goes down past the cave entrance and then down by the river before returning back to the picnic area. It was a nice hike and the dog enjoyed it as much as anyone.All in all, without going inside the cave, we spent about 2 hours wandering around and hiking. Take some water with you and wear comfortable shoes that fit well. I would not recommend flip flops or sandals that don't fit securely.

Mammoth Cave,"First let me say this trip was for my husband and I and our four children (10,7,5,1). We are from Florida. The weather was a little chilly but felt amazing in the cave. We did three different tours which I will review below:First tour on day 1 was the Historic tour: this is a two hour tour, with more ducking and weaving between rocks. This tour was a great way to get to know the park. Our tour guide Larry was a wealth of knowledge. Many places to stop along the tour and gain knowledge about different parts of the cave and the history of how it came to be apart of our national history. This tour includes a part called Fat Mans Misery, and let me say I am a larger woman (size 2X for reference) and I was carrying a baby in a front carrier and I didn’t have a to difficult time getting threw, just once I felt like I needed to crawl. This was my favorite tour of them all. Second tour of day one was Domes and Dripstone: This tour was done about 45 minutes after finishing the first one. This tour offered more visual excitement than the others. Also this is more physically demanding because there are over 500 steps, with 280 being the first thing you do to enter the cave. Our tour guide Katie was a delight. The Frozen Niagara part and where you learn about the stalactites and stalagmites were so amazing. All my children kept up well. Third tour on day two was Cleveland Avenue. We were slightly sore (remember we are from Florida). This tour was physically easiest we thought, after the 180 steps into the cave. You take an elevator back to the top. This is another two hour. We had Chris as our tour guide (he does many of the tours there including the Wild Cave tours and Trog tours). He has a great sense of humor and we enjoyed listening to him lead the tour. It showed us gypsum formations. This was my least favorite of the three but I still enjoyed being In The cave and gaining more knowledge of the system. If you are concerned physically about a cave tour this one was the easiest for us, but there uneven paths. Also they have a wonderful Jr. Ranger program here, if this will be a two day event, I suggest that you take the books home to work on over night!Again we loved this place a great for our Spring Break vacation!!If you have any questions please feel free to ask!!","March 22, 2019",Mammoth did not disappoint!!,30,"Palm Bay, Florida",5

Mammoth Cave,"We decided at the last minute to check out Mammoth Cave, my husband and I have lived our entire lives just outside of Nashville and had never been to Mammoth Cave, so we packed up our girls (10&12) and headed that way. The park and tours were all sold out by the time we got there the first day, but thankfully I had packed for one overnight stay ""just in case."" The park ranger told us to get back to the park early (8:30) the next morning so we could be sure to get a tour booked. We spent a couple hours doing some short hikes around the visitor center and exploring the inside exhibits that day until they closed. The next day we were at the park by 9:00 and most of the tours that we had originally wanted to do were sold out. Thankfully a super helpful park ranger suggested the Historic Tour, and it did not disappoint! A two hour walk through the magestic cave that our entire family enjoyed.

Also, we stayed in the campground which was well maintained....saw lots of deer throughout the area, as well as squirrels and many varieties of birds that came near our campsite. We were able to build a campfire in the designated ring near our trailer, the first of the season for us. Daffodils blooming enmass on hillsides in Park!

Several highlights include the cool rock formations throughout, such as massive pillars of limestone deposit, The Crystal Cafe, Booth's Amphitheater, the Frozen Niagra formation, and rich history of the area ant those who have explored parts of the miles of underground cave through history. There are several other cool cavern-related activities and awesome sights to see right there in the park.

Mammoth Cave,"This is unquestionably a mammoth site (412 miles and counting of underground caves). I took the Historic Tour which included the ""fat man's misery"" and other developments (Booth's Amphitheater). But there is no decoration on this tour. There may be stalagmites and stalactites in other parts of the caves, but not on this tour. I'm not sure what the ""Frozen Niagara"" includes but perhaps that has more decoration. To me it all seemed like a big catacombs like you would find in Europe. There are mummies of ancient people who had been discovered that are still buried somewhere in the caves.

Mammoth Cave,"My teenage daughter and I did the Domes and Dripstones tour. The cave, itself, is AMAZING and I just really can't fathom how big this cave system is. On the tour we took there were just under 300 steps down and through some crazy dripstone formations. The whole way down we heard a ton of water running/dripping down the walls, into the cave. It was really neat. Then you make it to the bottom and you are in a dead quiet sandstone room, completely opposite of what you experienced on the way down. AGAIN...Really neat. From here the Ranger teaches you about the cave system in what's like an underground auditorium with seating. I believe you are somewhere in the realm of 600 ft below the surface. After the brief lesson on the cave's history etc the tour starts. It's not very well lit, but I think that's part of what is special (and kind of creepy at the same time) about it. The formations are not nearly as pretty as some I have seen in ""Show Caves"" around the country. But I think it is all about how BIG or MAMMOTH the cave is and not about beauty. Our Ranger was very informative and pleasant, so no complaints there.","January 17, 2019",Cave System is impressive but lacks in lighting,79,"West Grove, Pennsylvania",4
Mammoth Cave,"My mom and I went on the Frozen Niagara tour. My mom is 73 years old and almost fell twice due to bad lighting. I can understand wanting to keep a ""gloomy"" ambiance, but it shouldn't come at the cost of safety. At least they could put in better lightening in the areas that are particularly darker. And then there are the Rangers. They do great spouting their memorized dialogue, but when we're all traveling between point A and B, they are impatient, rude, know-it-alls. They don't give people who are of slower-pace, like my mom and other elderly people in our group, a chance to gather around before the Ranger starts talking about the next place on the tour. I live in the area and have been on various Mammoth Cave tours. My experience with the Rangers have always been the same. My advice: Bring a high-beam flashlight to use, walk quickly to keep up with the Rangers and don't ask them about anything.","January 15, 2019",Better lighting and the Rangers need to be more empathetic...,5,,1

This was our 8th National Park this month (We were on a roadtrip) and this one was definitely the most disappointing. The website is VERY confusing to figure out, I could never find the tours that would be running at what times. I did see all the prices listed multiple times. We arrive in the morning around 10am and they only had 3 tours listed. None for the time we arrived and had to wait around for 2 hours until the next tour. When we asked about tours, everyone was very short with us and acted like we were wasting their time. Also, the prices in the gift shops were double compared to everywhere else!!

There are even tours for those with accessibility needs, with reservations recommended.","December 12, 2018",A Natural Wonder,43,Saskatoon,5
Mammoth Cave,"I was a bit worried before entering the cave, after the security speech of our guide, but it was not worrying. Some rooms are huge, you'll feel very small, and some path are tighter and you may touch the ceiling. It is a great experience, impressive when you think it is all naturally carved, definitely a thing to do in Kentucky !","December 9, 2018",Impressive experience,10,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"We took the historic cave tour to learn more about the cave's history. You enter through the historic cave entrance and walk about 2 miles on this tour. It is listed as moderate, which is probably about right since you have to climb a lot of stairs going down and back up at the end. There are also a few tight places to maneuver through.Being off season, we were on a tour with only about 40 people on a Saturday. Our ranger guide, John, was very informative. I can see if the tour is at capacity with 110 people, it might affect hearing everything that is said if you are at the back of the group. It is highly recommended to buy tickets ahead of time online. We tried to do that the night before, but it indicated only walk up tickets were available for the next day. Evidently, you can't buy online tickets same day and once the visitor center closes for the day, the next day must be considered same day. Not a problem off season, but could be during the summer.Having toured other large caves, this was a different experience. Since this cave was privately owned for many years, there are things that you don't normally see in a National Park...like graffiti on the cave walls and a former mining operation. It adds to the historical context and was interesting to see. Also a different cave experience since you don't see stalactites or stalagmites due to the type of rock in this cave.It is pretty amazing to think of over 400 miles of caves beneath your feet when you at on the surface. This is well worth the time if you are in the area.","December 8, 2018",Historic Cave Tour,311,"Grapeview, Washington",5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Caves is certainly a cool National Park. I wouldn't say it's one of the top, but if you're in southern KY you should stop by and explore. Unlike other NP's there's no fee to enter the park. That said,for any real exploration of the caves you absolutely need to book a tour. You can only get access to the largest, main cavern without a guide. I've done the Violet City Lantern tour, which was a lantern guided tour and was truly amazing. On this tour you get to see a lot of the ground covered by other, less expensive, tours. You walk through the caverns guided only by your flame lantern. I wouldn't recommend for small children, but great for anyone over the age of 12. I really think this is one of the best, if not THE best, tour they have to offer.I've also done the Domes & Dripstones Tour, which is great for families. It doesn't take you to very confined spaces, and offers a lot to see, overall, but it is heavy with stairs. Noting, it is a popular tour with families and the kids are often very loud and inquisitive, so if that's not your style of tour maybe opt for another tour offering.","December 5, 2018",Unique National Park.

Mammoth Cave,"We live in TN and not too far away from this cave. We took the Domes and Dripstones tour as two couples. The tour begins with a short bus ride and then you descent down 250 feet below ground. We had larger people in our group, but everyone was able to fit down the stairway with minimal effort. One larger person in our party was also a bit claustrophobic and she enjoyed the tour! There are times when you need to bend forward to walk through a tunnel, but the sides are open. The steps can get narrow, but you can turn sideways without issue. I am a typical sized person and I didn't have to turn sideways at all. The trip down the steps was most in our party's favorite part. At the end, I know you may be tired but definitely walk down the extra few steps to see the frozen niagra--this was the BEST part of the tour and worth a few steps back up. We reserved our tour online and we went on a very rainy day, so there were only 57 people in our tour group. Rainy days are great days for the cave!

Mammoth Cave,"We took the Domes and Dripstones Tour and the ranger (Ted) almost ruined it for us. First, Mammoth Cave NP is impressive in its scope. You have to be part of a ranger-guided tour to see the cave so we bought tickets for the Domes and Dripstones Tour. Even though the website, the park information and the box office said the tour was moderate, the ranger (after we already purchased tickets) talked about how they were all wrong and it was strenuous. It wasn’t. You do descend more than 200 steps (and climb back up gradually) but he was an alarmist. We get that you have a list of things we can’t do in the cave but he was so negative about everything I felt the collective energy of the group go down. And he was pretty young so have such a jaded attitude. We were frustrated that this tour had more than 100 people on it. It was a two-hour tour that could have taken 45 minutes if we didn’t have to wait for everyone to catch up. The fact that so many were allowed on this tour took away from our learning about the cave structure, its history and potential threats to caves. It was more about moving through a large group of people with no real interest or ability to educate. That part was disappointing. The stairs going down, however, were an engineering marvel and quite impressive. ","November 30, 2018",Almost a Ranger Ruined Tour,852,"Bolingbrook, Illinois",4
Mammoth Cave,"First, buy your tickets ONLINE. This really isn't a suggestion. I am so lucky to volunteer at the cave once a month, and I'm always sorry for the people who just show up without tickets and have the expectation of getting on the next tour. I'm sorry, because I want everyone to see this cave on a guided tour, and it disappoints me when people just don't prepare. Never, ever, ever drive a long distance without researching your destination. Get online and/or call as far in advance as possible to do some research. This is a popular park, so tickets have sold out for every tour every time I've worked. One reviewer stated that the employees at the ticket counter could care less about people picking up tickets. I'm wondering if they went to a different park. The desk when you walk in is NOT a ticket counter. Everyone working up there is quick to direct people to the actual ticket counter where tickets can be picked up and purchased. The ticket workers are sitting there all the time to provide tickets. The visitor desk is where you should stop if you don't know what tour you want to take and need information, or if you need trail maps, etc. Every person I've met that works there is dedicated to people having a good experience. They love the parks or they wouldn't be there. The rangers are amazing sources of information on all sorts of topics and other parks, so if you're interested in a particular subject, chances are there's a ranger who can intelligently speak on it. I love talking to the rangers, because I plan yearly trips to National Parks, and I've gotten a lot of insider info about Yellowstone, Tetons, Yosemite, Mesa Verde, just to name a few. A lot of the rangers have worked at other parks. Just like any business, there are always going to be newcomers, so before you judge a guide too harshly, you may want to think about how well you would do the job on your first few attempts. It is very challenging to learn everything you need to know about the largest cave system in the world. I'm quite sure it is a bit intimidating when a ranger first starts guiding tours. I could go there every weekend and do the tours multiple times. I don't think I could ever get tired of it. If I don't get all the information I feel that I wanted to get when I visit a park, I visit the library or the web. Learning is never finished.

We were not able to see the caves, take a tour nor a self guided tour at all that day and we were not able to stay until the next day. We had been on line and nothing was said about reservations required. Nor did it say anything about it being a day for school children only!

We were worried about getting to the caves and being bored hanging around waiting for the tour to start but there was an exhibit on the history of the cave that was very interesting. Plan to get to the caves at least an hour early. Make sure you buy your ticket online to ensure you get a spot on the tour you want as the group was pretty full.The other thing to note is that we went in November on a chilly day. However, the caves typically maintain an average temperature around 54 degrees which was very comfortable.Tip: The tour details discussed many times the number of stairs you would need to go up and down. Majority of the stairs were down.

Mammoth Cave,"We love our National Parks! And Mammoth Cave is another beauty. Wow. We were visiting family so not on our own for a vehicle otherwise we probably would have gone for at least a second day and trip below the surface. However the one tour we did take was spectacular. Our park ranger was most knowledgeable and very entertaining too. Lots of local lore shared by our guide. Stalactites, stalagmites and columns galore! Giant cave crickets did not disappoint the 10 year old with us! I do think it is worth arriving early and going through the museum and exhibits before going into the caves. There is a park ranger in the front of the pack and one at the end with a bus load of people in between the two rangers which is not conducive to asking questions in the moment. So having some background knowledge fresh in mind is helpful. What I didn’t realize soon enough was traversing the stairs down into the cave IS PART of your experience so don’t rush. You know the expression “it isn’t he destination: it’s the journey”? This epitomizes that! I felt rushed because as stated before it is an entire busload single file down a one way narrow set of stairs in dimly lit conditions with adrenaline flowing too. For what it is worth I consider myself relatively claustrophobic and initially it was a bit of a challenge to navigate the smaller passageways but once in the great rooms and witnessing this natural wonder in all its glory I relaxed and was fine. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. I wish I knew more about photography to know what setting my camera should have been set to....no flash allowed.

After a short bus ride, the guides fired up the lanterns and led our small group on an amazing journey. There was a hiccup checking in (a glitch with their computer system) that led to missing the earlier tour, but other than that it was a fantastic experience. I would highly recommend visiting Mammoth Cave in October rather then during the summer, when I'm told the crowds can really spoil your fun.

Mammoth Cave,"We wanted a nice overview of the cave and had the time for the four hour tour. We were concerned about how strenuous it would be and if we could stay warm. Our guide met us wearing a short sleeve shirt and gave a warning before we boarded the bus for the ride to the entrance. “If you can’t remember the last time you walked four miles, this is not the tour for you!” We were also warned that an evacuation from the cave could take hours. The tour can accommodate more than seventy people; ours had less than twenty. No one backed out.I was glad I wore stiffer soled hiking shoes, my companion wore athletic shoes and found the hard packed dirt path rough. I carried water, but didn’t really need to, as there were drinking fountains at both restroom stops. A backpack was handy to hold our jackets as we got too warm while walking. I brought a flashlight, but didn’t need it. Another person on the tour used a flashlight, waving it around on the cave walls and I found it distracting.Mammoth is, for the most part, a dry limestone cave. On this tour we only saw flowstone formations near the end. You won’t have to remember the difference between stalagmites and stalactites. There were some amazing and delicate flower like formations. The most impressive thing about Mammoth is the size of the “rooms” and the length of the cave system. Four hours and four miles and we saw about 1% of the known cave.If you are reasonably fit and can climb several flights of stairs without being winded or having to rest, you should be able to handle this tour.","November 2, 2018",The 4 Hour Tour,118,"Madison, Wisconsin",5
Mammoth Cave,"My wife and I enjoyed the Mammoth Cave National Park. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and very witty, which made for an interesting and enjoyable tour.

It is definitely a must-see Park. ","November 2, 2018",Very interesting ,112,"Sharon, Massachusetts",4

The views were amazing. I loved hearing the history of area and learning about the characteristics of there different parts of the caves. There were a few stopping points along the tour that allowed us to sit and hear stories. They shut the lights off and one point so we could experience what the people discovering the caves were up against. So cool!,"October 29, 2018",Domes and Dripstones,1,United States,5

Super friendly staff and some great exercise I found myself hundreds of feet below ground snapping pictures constantly. The history of the area is very educational and now that I have seen it would recommend it as the primary reason for a planned trip.

Mammoth Cave,"My wife and I took a long weekend to visit Mammoth Cave NP. We took the Historic Tour one morning and the Domes and Dripstones tour the next morning. Both were led by outstanding young rangers who were patient, knowledgeable and informative. The historic tour was not difficult, but people with bad knees or backs should heed the warnings about certain areas of this hike. There are a lot of steps and the Fat Man's Misery and Tall Man's Agony sections are not easy to traverse if you have these ailments. Whoever was disappointed because there were no stalagtites and stalagmites obviously did not take the Domes and Dripstones tour as the whole second portion of this tour is that type of architecture. There is a long, tight stairwell descent for the first part of the tour but after that it is not very difficult. All in all, we enjoyed all aspects of the tours and the clean, well-kept grounds. All personnel were very friendly and helpful.","October 28, 2018",Enjoyable tours and sites,24,"Columbus, Mississippi",5
Mammoth Cave,"It is the longest but it is not very pretty. No stalactites or stalagmites. Went on the Handicapped tour which had to be reserved months in advance. You follow the rangers in their vehicle to another place where there is an elevator to transport group. There were etchings in the rocks where early cave explorers left information. There can be bats but we saw none. After being underground, we all had to have our shoe soles sprayed with some cleaner. Anyone with an ADA device had all their wheels sprayed.","October 27, 2018",Mammoth Caves is world’s longest cave,7,,3
Mammoth Cave,"This is a fantastic, moderately easy tour in Mammoth Cave National Park. The tour is conducted entirely by Propane lantern light, as there is NO electricity in the cave. There is a short bus ride to the entrance (a steel door), during which the park ranger provides history and stories. Once you enter the cave and descend a narrow staircase, it opens up to larger rooms, some with beautiful stalagmites and stalactite formations. It is a “round trip” tour, entering and exiting at the same location. Once down the stairs, the walking is mostly on an uneven dirt path. Given the limited light, footing can be uneven, wet, and slippery, so wear sturdy shoes. There are NOT handrails throughout, and walking sticks and canes are prohibited on this tour. IF YOU ARE CLAUSTROPHOBIC DO NOT TAKE THIS TOUR. The entrance consists of about 140 stairs down a very narrow, winding passage, with cave walls extending up both sides and low cave ceilings in some areas.","October 27, 2018",Fantastic formations by lantern-light,94,"Jackson, Michigan",5

Mammoth Cave,"Who new that Cave Crickets exist? Every time we visit MCNP we learn about a new creature, flower, a historical event, etc. Went this past weekend to try out the ""RV experience"" (we rented one) at Singing Hills RV park just outside of the National Park. We bought tickets online prior to leaving for our trip about 4 days prior. We had been there in the Spring and the weekend cave tours had sold out. We took both the Historical and the Domes & Dripstones tour. The Historical tour was relatively easy but there are some places you need to duck to get through and there were stairs at the end. Pace was good. The Domes tour was more intense but doable for most. The beginning had 150+ steps in a narrow stairwell to climb down. About 7yrs ago we attend with young children, 5 yr old climbed all the stairs, 3 yr old fell asleep while husband carried child down the stairs and throughout the tour (without a bjorn). The visitor center has a nice exhibit to view and 2 gift shops. Don't forget to ask about the Junior Park Ranger program. It is a must for kids of any ages and has different requirements based on ages. Kids can work together to complete their ""workbook"" and learn about the National Parks. We actually did this without going on a cave tour back in the spring but did require about 2 hours of researching info in the exhibit, around the park and to attend at least one ranger led activity. (Some ranger led activities are outside of the cave tours.) Kids get an official MCNP Junior Ranger Badge. They are worth collecting at each park!Across the bridge from the visitor center is a hotel with an ice cream/coffee shop and a restaurant along with another gift shop. We chose to picnic in the area. We all were hoping to see such beautiful trees changing color but it is a late, late fall. Just means we will have to return.","October 24, 2018",Learn something every time we come to Mammoth Cave NP,10,"Dublin, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave was amazing! People I've talked to said that they went as children. Well I'm saying go back as an adult! So interesting! Go into the museum they have in the visitor's center. It is great! Very informative. Really tells you how the caves were formed, and videos of how they were discovered. Truly taught me so much about this cave system, very, very interesting!The Cave itself....WOW! I wasn't expecting the magnitude of it's size - no wonder they named it Mammoth! The Domes and Drips stones tour really showed off it's beauty, but the Historical Tour was very interesting. The massive size of these tunnels had my jaw hanging open for most of the tour!We stayed in the historical cottages that were built in the 1920's. Wonderful little cottages, and the deer come strolling out of the woods to graze in the grassy area right in front of the cottage. We say on our stoop and enjoyed the friendly wildlife. What a show.","October 22, 2018","Wow, I never knew! Must see!",39,"McHenry, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"I am in my 40s and have never been to Mammoth Cave. It was worth the wait. I am sure it would not have looked as big if I had gone in my 20s. The idea of visiting a cave may sound boring, but you can't help be in awe of the magnitude of what has been created. The history of the place is incredible. We took the two hour Historical Tour and the four hour Grand Avenue Tour. Both featured different parts of the cave system. There is so much information to hear from the rangers and to learn in the visitor's center. There is also much to do on the surface and in the area. It is a great short vacation.","October 19, 2018",Mammoth Good Time,12,,5
Mammoth Cave,"Such a great tour with beautiful formations and huge rooms! We went to Mammoth Cave for our honeymoon because we are avid spelunkers in West Virginia! We were so excited to see the Worlds Longest Cave and take pictures of the things we saw. We hung out toward the back of the group as instructed because we are faster walkers. Everything was fine until we reached the Drapery Room, we were amongst the last 5 people in the group trying to enjoy the formations when RANGER BRICE decided to be a JERK (I tried to use a more appropriate word but profanity isn’t allowed in these reviews) and inform us we didn’t have time to take any pictures because everyone else before us took to long in the room. After being there for only about 10 seconds, he all but pushed us up the stairs to the next part of the tour. He really didn’t sound like he knew much about the cave or geology either. He kept stumbling over his words and correcting himself halfway through his sentences. We paid good money and drove all the way to Kentucky for the sole purpose of seeing this cave and all it has to offer. He single handedly ruined my honeymoon and Mammoth Cave for my husband and I. Other than a TERRIBLE tour guide though, I would highly recommend this National Park to anyone.","October 17, 2018",Domes & Dripstones Tour (pray you don’t end up with Ranger Brice as your guide),3,,3

The self guided tour was honestly a little lackluster and was just walking around in a large cave. (All of the tunnels are blocked off for the other tours so we couldn’t go down any of those) We had visited onyx cave the day before which had some beautiful formations and colors and we did not see any of this in mammoth cave.The trails around the park were nice and well kept up, we just weren’t super impressed with the cave itself.

Mammoth Cave,"We enjoyed the Historic tour and the Dripstone tours on separate days. I had hurt my back the day before and was a little nervous about it on day 1 for the Historic tour after listening to the warnings. The historic tour was easy until you get to the stairs. If you have shortness of breath on a flight of stairs, don’t do any of the moderate tours. The Dripstone tour was my favorite because you could really appreciate the authenticity of the surroundings and how exciting it would be to discover these underground masterpieces. The ground was slick and uneven in places and I was so glad to not have young children with me. We had a 12 year old with us and it was perfect. If your kids are the whiny type, I would skip this until they are older. I felt sorry for a couple families with young kids on the Dripstone and also for the parents carrying babies on the Historic. Also, spiders on the Dripstone. Lots of impressive spiders. Don’t think you are going to get a verbally guided tour. You must listen to the tour guide at stopping points because there is no way you will hear them unless you are the first person in line. Guides were great though. Maintaining order and answering questions. Another bonus was it has rained for days! It is dry in the cave except for the bonus waterfalls on the Dripstone tour. They are not usually that impressive when it is dry out. So glad we came. ","October 15, 2018",Fun trip with older kids,6,"Eagle Creek, Indiana",5

The area is really beautiful and our tour was very informative - Ranger Ryan answered all of our questions and then some. I wish we could have seen more of the cave (the tour stops several times to give details about history, formation, etc.), but I guess that just gives us a reason to go back!

Mammoth Cave,"This is a very nice cave trip but it did have some issues. We took the Historical route, which is a guided tour. These are the negatives. The group was way to large for the number of guides. There must have been a hundred of us. The lead guide was informative IF you could get close enough to hear what she had to say. The pace was pretty quick and the group got strung out. The guide was more concerned with finishing on time then providing information. There was very little time to take pictures or to just observe the different formations and historical features. There are several areas with low ceilings and tight confines, banged my head a couple of times but close environments don't bother me. I, unfortunately, saw Carlsbad first so I am comparing the two. Which is unfair. This is a suitable trip for children as long as they can walk a distance. Older folks should evaluate their capacity due to some slippery areas, multiple steps, and inclines. Also, the pace that the guide may set. Overall the historical aspects of the cave are very interesting and other areas of the cave may have some more interesting rock features. I would go back and check out some of the other areas but I would not go out of my way to make a special trip there.","October 14, 2018",This is a very nice cave trip,16,"Fruitland Park, Florida",4

Each tour was unique from each other and really saw totally different aspects of the Cave.Both rangers were organized, full of information, paid attention to the group in total. Since these tours are large, they stop at different intervals, take time to answer questions, give you lots of info and history. I don't recommend the self guided tour, you don't get the full experience as a guided tour.A few tips: You need to be able to handle steps on both tours, the first tour is 2 miles so you have to be semi-fit. Make sure if you purchase your tickets on line you get the hard copy tickets before going to the meeting area for the tour. We were able to go the afternoon before and pick up tickets. At that time, we did all the activities in the Visitor's Center. Before the tours begin the lines can be long.

That was a bit disappointing as the other areas of the caves are not available to go into unless you book a tour. The park was beautiful and the facilities are very well kept.

I did not feel as though I was in an enclosed area as I did on the Wind Cave tour in North Dakota.

There are many tight places and areas where you must duck. We felt as if we were rushing through the tour and not able to even glance at our surroundings.

We did the Niagara tour with our 4 year old and she enjoyed it, but if she were any younger, it probably wouldn't have been a good idea. The Historic Tour was just us adults and it was great. At times it felt like it was going a little too fast to really take it in, and I think there were too many people in the group cause at times the Ranger was so far ahead of us we couldn't hear him. We really enjoyed our time here and will be coming back when our kid is older. It's a wonderful National Park.My advice, stay at the lodge and not at the hotels by the freeway.

Mammoth Cave,"We were passing through while on vacation and we not sure what time we would actually get to the park on that day. Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico has self guided tours every day. Mammoth Cave NP only has self guided tours only during the summer. So even on a very busy day a week after Labor Day, there were no self guided tours. Most of the guided tours are early in the morning, so if you arrive late in the afternoon, there is very little to choose from in terms of guided tours. There really is no reason why you can not do a self guided tour any time of the year. The caves are outstanding, just wish they would let folks do their own thing.","September 19, 2018",Need Self Guided Tours Year Round,140,"Churchville, Maryland",5
Mammoth Cave,"Our family of 5 (kids 13 and 17) took the historic tour-it was well worth the money. The caves were nothing short of breathtaking, the guide was up beat, friendly and kept everyone engaged. The pace was easy. Plenty of stairs and walking so be prepared. Tennis shoes recommended. Bring a bottle of water and a light jacket as it is in the 50's all year within the caves. Very relaxing way to spend a few hours and get out of the Kentucky heat while having an adventure.","September 19, 2018",Historic Tour,40,Clinton Township,5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave was a destination for me personally for some years. This year we finally got a chance to go and it certainly exceeded my expectations. There are multiple tours you can choose from, make sure to book ahead of time to get the one you want and show up early. We were pleasantly surprised that there was an excellent visitors center complete with gift stores and a free museum that you can waste time at if you are super early (like we were). The cave tour was perfect, the tour guides seem enthusiastic and knowledgeable. We were surprised that the tour was a lot of walking but very much enjoyed the scenery. I feel like the tour could have been more exciting at times but it was nice to be left alone to look on your own pace too. It was not scary or hard or physically taxing as the descriptions lead us to believe. We were in the cave around 2 hours or so, definitely worth the money. We wished that we booked one more tour but they were pretty much sold out by the day we were actually there visiting. The cave was chilly but not enough for me to need to hoodie I was told I would need. It was extremely hot and muggy outside so it felt good to enjoy some ""free air-conditioning"".The tours are over for the season now so make sure to book a trip at the right time. After our tour we were excited to hike one of the trails near the cave. We expected to see more wildlife or natural wonders, it was pretty bland. We took the trail straight down to the river sticks, but I immediately regretted walking nearly a mile down the hill for what we saw at the bottom of the mountain. I think we were just tired but it was still worth it. The surrounding cities were accommodating but we could tell the cave was the main attraction. There was a couple fun things to do if you were willing to drive around. Mainly we enjoyed big mike's rocks and gift shop near the cave. It was worth a stop. To sum up the trip, its worth going to see. You will learn some things but mostly enjoy the ride. xoxo","September 19, 2018",One of a kind experience!,3,"Cleveland, Ohio",5

The differences in each cave were distinct & amazing! All caves stay around 55degrees so take a light jacket if you tend to be cold. Also, highly recommend a flashlight or headlamp to use periodically throughout tour so you can spotlight certain areas& helps for pictures as no flash photography is allowed but the lights are as you do not shine them in people’s faces(common sense).

Our guide was excellent, and the cave was interesting and beautiful. We definitely plan to come back for some of the other tours. I got a tiny bit claustrophobic at the very beginning of the tour, but I was in the very back of the group, and the ranger at the back was very patient and talked to me until I got myself ready to go (I was over it within the first 5 minutes, but I loved how the ranger was equipped to handle a situation like that very calmly and sweetly.)","September 16, 2018",So much fun!,21,"Gallatin, Tennessee",5
Mammoth Cave,"Being from flat land, no rock formations Florida, we cannot get enough of the beautiful rock formations. Every step of the Scenic tour was interesting and beautiful. I am sure we will always remember Kelli (volunteer). There is no doubt that she loves what she does: evident in her smile, in her mannerisms and in conveyance of the Mammoth Cave history/information. Description of Kelli: warm, enthusiastic and passionate about what she does. Mammoth Cave should hire her! Oh that we could have taken more time going through. Often, we were last in the group. Ranger John followed the group and answered our many questions. If our yearly travels take us within 3 hours of Mammoth Cave, we will go again.During this vacation, we also went to Meramec Caverns (nice, but too expensive) and Jewel Cave (which we will visit again). If you want to see awesome stalagmites and stalactites, go to Jewel Cave (Mammoth Cave is a mostly dry cave, so does not have any).Negatives:I don’t think information area (in lobby) did a good job explaining the challenges. It isn’t the crouching required that is a problem; rather, in the required crouching area, it is the extremely narrow passage and dimly lit barely wide enough path to place both feet. I suppose a very fat person would not want to take a 2 mile walk, which is good because they would not be able to get through the narrow passage. The cleaning mat that must be walked over was not properly described. There is so much water on/under the mats that the top of my husband’s sneakers got wet, and my feet got wet. I objected because I did not want to get my feet wet and I did not want the top of my walking sandals to get wet.

And an elevator ride back to the top. The Lantern tour was reminiscent of caving in the 1950's. The lanterns are bright enough to see where you are stepping; at least as well lit as the electric lights on the Cleveland Avenue tour. Toughest part was selecting tours to go on. The govt. site is not well organized. I wanted to compare #steps, level of difficulty and length of tour, and percentage of overlap - not all in one place. But once we got there, the tours were fun.

Mammoth Cave,Our family loves going to national parks so we were very excited about visiting Mammoth Cave National Park. The park website warns you not to exclusively rely on gps as it can take you to the wrong section of the park and possibly cause you to miss your tour time. Our map app was going to lead us to the middle of the park instead of the visitor center. We traveled north on I-65 and exited at Cave City which was then a straight shot into the park. There are plenty of signs and we had no problems getting there.We decided to do the Domes and Dripstones tour because although it lasts 2 hours it only travels .75 miles and we though that would be doable for everyone in our party. I would definitely recommend buying your tickets ahead of time to get the particular tour and time that will work best. We went on a Friday in the summer and many of the tours were sold out when we arrived at the visitor center. Buying them online is very easy and there are no fees.We boarded a bus to take us to the entrance of the cave. The trip over was very short. After a quick talk by the ranger we descended many stairs down into the cave. I thought the tour was very well done and went into great detail about the cave and it’s history. We had over 100 people in our group but Ranger Gillespie made it work. Although it is certainly cooler in the cave the tour keeps you moving so I never needed a jacket. It’s not a bad idea to take one though. When we were done the bus took us back and dropped us off in front of the lodge to disinfect our shoes.Our kids love doing Junior Ranger programs and were able to complete enough activities on the bus to and from the cave. We ate at Spelunkers Cafe inside the lodge which was very convenient. Afterwards we walked down a nearby trail to see the historical entrance to the cave. We didn’t have enough time to even do the self guided tour but it was fun to see the opening.

Select your tour carefully, select one that suits your endurance and health capabilities. It can be cool in the cave so take a light jacket. Photos dont turn out very good as the lighting in the caves is amber so all your photos have a amber/red haze.

Mammoth Cave,"We traveled down to Kentucky to tour Mammoth caves. I'm not an experienced hiker but my travel companion is. We opted for the Grand Avenue tour. 4 hours, 4 miles which sounded like we would be walking very slow but we both did well with it. She wasn't bored and I didn't have difficulty keeping up. This tour shows part of the Domes and Dripstones, Frozen Niagara, Historic tour and I think one other. It's pretty much the catch all of the tours. The experience was great and while the beginning was definitely easy walking, there was some climbing up Mt. McKinley as they call it and also lots of steps. There were people of all ages (young children to an older couple) that were able to do this tour. Our ranger, tour guide, Chris was great. Very informative, answered all of our questions including how long he has been caving, what his favorite tour is, etc. After the tour we wanted to hike around the trails outside. We started with the River Styx trail but did have to cut our hike short due to a thunderstorm that rolled in.

Mammoth Cave,"Staying at Mammoth Park Lodge, right in the heart of things. Lots to do without having to go far. Just about everything requires moderate walking and exertion (steep stairs, narrow/low passageways in caves).You can only go in the caves with a park tour. Ok, but the Guided tours are a little expensive. However, be prepared for at least some level of amazement. Unless you have physical limitations, the Domes/dripstone walking tour is a don’t miss and for some may be a bucket list thing. Rangers are good communicators and accessible.Accommodations range from rustic (no AC or TV) cabins to modern motel style lodging. Food options are ok, nothing special, but the focus here isn’t on cuisine.Ambiance is dictated by unique combination of lots of oldsters and lots of youngsters.A few tips ... you will appreciate footwear with good treads as the cave floors are slippery wet in many places. Carry a light sweater or jacket no matter how hot as the temperature plunges suddenly to mid-fifties when entering caves. Finally, don’t expect good internet/phone connections outside of main buildings.","September 6, 2018",Caveman Paradise,46,"Gambier, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"My wife and I did the 9:45am Historic tour on Tuesday, August 28th. I took the Historic tour around 4yrs ago and enjoyed it then. Our tour started on time, at the shelter just outside the back door to the visitors center. Our lead guide was Alicia. She was great! Very personable and gave us plenty of information during the tour. I believe our group was about half of the maximum amount of people per tour. So we had a very manageable group and they seemed to stick together fairly well. We did stay pretty close to Alicia for the duration of the tour, as it made it much easier for us to hear her as we were moving along. I enjoyed the tour even more than I did 4yrs ago.

Mammoth Cave,"Our road trip through Tennessee ended in Nashville and my husband suggested we stop at Mammoth Cave, Kentucky on our way home to New Jersey. We took the Historic Tour and the Domes and Dripstones Tour, both two hours long. Our tour guides gave us a thorough briefing before the tours began. The cave is cold when you first enter (I believe mid 50 degrees), but I warmed up quickly with all the climbing, walking, twisting, turning and ducking. I left my sweater behind for the second tour. The cave is slippery in places and shoes with good traction are advisable. I saw several people wearing flip-flops and surprised that they did all right. The tours were interesting and informative and I took many photos because it's difficult to find the right camera setting in that environment. No flash photography is allowed. The tour guides, Jason and Zack for both tours, were courteous and eager to answer our questions. I had a thoroughly enjoyable time and would love to go back for some of the other tours that are offered. They don't require reservations, but they are recommended.

Mammoth Cave,"We stayed at the Woodland Cottages for Labor Day 2018. The weather was HOT. The cabins are adequate, but extremely rustic. This is a step above camping. The beds were not good, but to be expected. There is no AC. Between 10 at night and 7 in the morning the temp in the cabins is pleasant, even on 95 degree days. It was a wonderful experience for our 6 year old. We took the little green ferry across the green river at night. Highly recommend as this is one of the few old ferry boats remaining that operates this way. The stars were amazing! I agree with the other commenters - the park after dark is magical. Deer were everywhere! We did the dromes and dripstones tour into the cave. I would not be worried about your size or build for the adventure, but I would extremely recommend you are in shape and your legs are accustomed to this kind of work out. I'm somewhat active (or so I thought) and this tour kicked my tail. There are 500 plus stairs both up and down as well as very uneven surfaces and steep slopes. I found it challenging to look around and felt rushed. The park rangers warn you before you board the buses. Take them seriously. If you are not accustomed to steps and are regularly extremely active, do not take this tour. My legs are more sore than a week of boot camp. Opt for the frozen Niagara instead. The Sunday before Labor day the tours were all showing sold out, but the morning of our tour there were others open first thing on site, including Frozen Niagara. The tour was wonderful, but my body was not prepared for it. The breakfast buffet at the lodge was adequate.

Mammoth Cave,"Not since birth have I been inside such a vast cave. My wife and I went on the 2 hour historic tour. I was a bit hesitant since the ranger mentioned fat mans misery, tall mans agony, and if ya have issues with heights ya might not want to do this tour, or if you have issues with confined spaces, this might not be the tour for you. I'm just thinking ""omg, this sounds like a fricken house of horrors! I have issues with all those things!!!"" Fortunately the description was worse than the reality, though if you are short with a big butt, you may want to reconsider. I'm 6'2"" so my ample hindquarters were able to make it through ok.I loved the fact that the majority of the path is concrete, sure it takes away from the experience a bit, but the convenience totally outweighs that minor criticism. The cave was quite beautiful and impressive. By the time we made it through fat man's misery to our stop where we sat and asked our guide questions, we didn't realize we were almost done with the tour. It really seemed to go a lot faster than 2 hours. The 5 story tower climb was a bit of a workout, but well worth it.My wife is already talking about wanting to come back and explore more of the cave. I don't know when that will happen, but I'd like to tour the corvettes assembly plant and go to LS fest, so I'm sure we will make our way back to the area and go back to Mammoth cave. I would say if you're in the Bowling Green area, you must go to Mammoth Cave.

Even with hip replacement, I was able to handle all the walking and the stairs. Gregg and Julie were the two tour guides and they set a nice pace. They told such interesting facts about the various parts of the cave. I would recommend that the Park not allow extremely small children (under age 4) to go on these tours. Our tour had several children under age 3 and infants and their crying made it hard to hear the tour guides. Also, it caused quite a lag in the group.","September 2, 2018",Learn and see something new,4,"Orlando, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"We chose to do the Frozen Niagra tour because we have small children (3, 6 and 8 years old). The tour itself was well done, we had experienced rangers who were very knowledgable about the cave and had great stories to tell. The Frozen Niagra tour is one of their shortest and while the tour lasts 1 hour and 15 minutes, you are probably in the cave for only about half that time. You take a bus to the cave entrance and then the rangers give a safety talk before entering the cave. Even though the tour is short, there is still lots of cave formations to see. We went down to the Drapery Room, which entailed hiking down 25 stairs and up again. This part was completely optional, and gives you a view from behind Frozen Niagra where it looks like drapes of stones. Our kids did great on the tour, but every kid is different. The 6 year old was a little scared heading into the cave since it is kind of dark and illuminated with orange lights, but she got over that fairly quickly. The 3 year old did fine as well, she walked most of the time and only got antsy/wanted to be carried when we stopped in parts of the cave for the rangers to explain things. It was also late in the day with no nap, so that was a part of it too. It was cold in the cave, so you should remember to bring a jacket. Overall a great experience. Looking forward to coming back when the kids are older and doing a longer tour.We also hiked some of the hikes from the Visitor Center. The Sunset Area on the Heritage Trail gives a nice view of the park. We took the Mammoth Cave Sink Trail to the River Styx Trail. It was a nice hour long hike.

We ended up taking the Cleveland Ave tour and were not disappointed. The whole place is very well run and in good condition. Easy to navigate. Our guides were very good and really added to the experience. It was 2-3 hours and that was the perfect amount of time for us. I enjoyed when they turned out all the lights for a minute.

Mammoth Cave,"The Historic Tour will give you a general idea of the size of this cave and some interesting tidbits about the history. Nothing we viewed on the tour indicated that the cave was still active - if you're looking to be dazzled by stalactites and stalagmites this isn't that cave. You will be impressed by the enormity though. Also, if you want a less crowded tour I would recommend that you go private. There were way too many folks on our tour and you couldn't hear what the guide was saying towards the back. However, I'm not sure how much of the tour you are allowed to see if you choose private. I recommend going to the national park website and booking any tours in advance. There are bathrooms about half-way through.","August 31, 2018",Amazingly huge!,42,"Houston, Texas",5

Mammoth Cave,"This is one of the most amazing places I have every visited in my life. Roads to the park, visitor center, and park attractions are all well signed. The park itself is well cared for, clean, and well maintained.The visitor center was clean, well maintained, and was kept at a comfortable temperature. The restrooms were very clean. Most of the rangers and staff members I interacted with were very friendly, helpful, and full of useful information. There was one staff member that seemed to have a chip on her shoulder and messed up the ticket for one of my tours, but another staff member was very apologetic and fixed my ticket. I took four of the tours over two days, the Domes and Drip-stones, Historic, Violet City Lantern and Great Onyx Lantern. All the rangers on the tours were amazing! They were friendly, informative, and had a good sense of humor. The Violet City tour was very physically demanding, but was worth it. You get to see parts of the cave that no other visitors get to see, including the two largest caverns in the cave system. The Great Onyx Cave tour was the prettiest in my opinion. If you are planning a trip, read the tour descriptions in detail and talk to people before booking tours as some of them overlap portions of the cave. Also, take the warnings about how physically demanding the tours are seriously and do not go on a tour your are physically incapable of completing.It is very difficult to take good pictures in the cave. I strongly suggest putting down the camera and just living in the moment for a few hours so you can take it all in.There are plenty of things to do and places to visit in the park beyond the caves, although I was mainly interested in the caves.","August 30, 2018",Experience of a Lifetime,22,"London, Ontario",5

We arrived at the excellent visitor centre early and the electronic boards listed the cave tours for the day along with a brief description, plenty of rangers around to help decide which is best for you. We decided to do two to get the most out of our visit and they were both excellent. The rangers guiding were superb, knowledgable of course, friendly, humorous and willing to answer all questions posed to them. The tours varied in price but I thought they were very good value, ours were $10 and $12 each.

Mammoth Cave,"Visited mid-day on a Monday. Nice presentation at the visitor's center of area history and geology. Friendly visitor's center staff. Different tours start on a regular schedule. I took the shorter ""Historic Tour,"" which highlights the history of the cave from discovery through mining and early tourist days to the present day. Comfortable, sturdy shoes are recommended. The cave is quite cool at the early elevations, where many needed jackets, but gets quite warm at deeper elevations - most ended up carrying their jackets. Due to the rigorous walking and climbing I wouldn't recommend this tour for small children if you're not sure they're physically prepared. Through many stretches of the cave, carrying children is not an option. Climbing on structures off of the paved path is prohibited, and falls over curbing or uneven walking surfaces are possible. The Park Ranger guides were amazing! Amusing and informative! There is a LOT of walking - down a long flight of outdoor steps to the cave entrance, up and down well-maintained, paved pathways within the cave, up and down a limited number of very narrow, steep steps inside the cave and up (and up, and up, and up, and up!) two metal staircases near the end of the tour. Total decent inside the cave was 400-feet, which means ascending that same distance at some point. Near the end of the tour is a 125-step straight metal staircase with no landings. Then, a short time later, there's a 175-step metal staircase with several landings as it winds its way up. That's a big chunk of vertical distance to climb almost all at once! Inside the cave, there's a stretch called ""Fat Man's Misery."" I'm over 6-feet and near 300-pounds and fit through comfortably, though polishing the walls with my coat along the way and hunched over due to low headroom. Those with issues in confined spaces, however, should beware. Limited handicapped access to the cave is available via a lift near the cave entrance. Overall, an awesome experience.

If you are visiting Louisville / Lexington, this is worth the trip. Book your tour in advance because they do fill up. We booked a tour with a maximum of 30 people. Some of the tours have 100 people maximums which is a lot if you are trying to hear the guide and are at the back of the 100 person pack. We did the Frozen Niagara tour and it was absolutely amazing.

When we got there we saw that the tour was fully booked all day, so be sure to book online in advance. Way cool. Lots of stairs so be sure to wear comfortable shoes and some spots are slippery so have good soles. Saw only 1 bat and the guide said that was one more than usual. Didn't see any snakes or spiders or such.After the tour we loved it so much we wanted to book another but the tours were all booked up by then.

Unless it was a scheduled stop along the route, the rear guide kept telling us, ""don't stop to take pictures."" Now if I pay $ to take pics, I should be allowed to. We were told at beginning it was ok, just no flash. If I wanted to do a 2-mile walk, could of stayed home and saved $.

Mammoth Cave,"We did the 2 hour Domes and Dripstones tour, and bought our tickets weeks ahead of time. We were advised to do so, and that's good advice. These tours sell out fast! We got there early because we drove into Central Time and gained an hour, so we spent that time in their small museum. It was very interesting and we were glad we had the time for it. The tour itself was amazing. This cave is huge in the distance it covers, but not as you're going through it. We went down many, many steps, through some very narrow areas where you had to turn sideways, some dark sections, and some low overheads. If you're claustrophobic, this is not for you. It's also cool in the cave, so best to wear a jacket or sweatshirt, although it's also damp so you'll still get a cold sweat. We stopped 3 times at places where we could sit and listen to the tour guide talk about the cave. Try to be up front where it's easier to hear. She did the best she could, but I would think it'd be hard to hear in the back. The crowds tend to be large, at least in season. After the tour we had lunch in one of several cafes where I was pleased to see they had a variety of vegetarian choices. The food was good and inexpensive. It's exactly what we wanted after all of our trekking.","August 21, 2018",Fascinating!,10,"Walworth, New York",5
Mammoth Cave,We chose the two hour tour and enjoyed seeing the in Normandy of the cave. There were very few stalactites and stalagmites on this specific tour even though the guide said other tours have more. It was fun meandering through some of the tight squeeze areas.The tour guide was a disappointment. We were a group of 120 tourists and he mainly only spoke to the first 20 people in the group. He only stopped for the majority of the group 3 times. I’m not sure he is completely to blame because it was the peak season and they were trying to rush the groups through. I would suggest going at an off peak season if possible. Also make sure your group is ready for a two hour vigorous walk. Some of our group we’re having lots of difficulty because of being overweight or not in shape for a two hour walk.,"August 21, 2018",Exploring,0,"Pompano Beach, Florida",4
Mammoth Cave,FYI.....book your hiking trip in advance because they sell out early. If you wait until you get to the park you will be disappointed. There are several different types of tours you can choose from but we chose the 4hr tour which is rated very strenuous but I didn't think it was strenuous at all. The Rangers were very informative and made the tour more enjoyable. I was constantly looking for bats within the cave system but I didn't see a single bat.The 4hr tour sounds like a long time but the time flew and before we knew it we were coming to the end of the tour. The whole family enjoyed this cave tour and would do it again.,"August 20, 2018",Very cool family trip!!,14,,5
Mammoth Cave,"The caves are beautiful and this was a fun trip for our kids (11 and 9). We did learn a few lessons, though.First, sturdy footwear is a good idea. We wore sneakers and hiking boots and wouldn’t have wanted less.Second, dress in layers as it is no kidding 55 degrees underground. This probably feels great in winter, but we were happy to have our sweatshirts with us even though it was hot outside.Third, tour groups are large, and the guides are very knowledgeable. Stick to the front of the pack if it all possible so that you can really hear them. They give good presentations at the stops, but the real gems are as you go.If you’re at all claustrophobic, please seriously think about taking the tours. Read the descriptions available online and do your research to make sure you choose the right tour for everyone in your group. Books tour reservations in advance - the best tours and times fill very quickly and several things were already sold out when we arrived early in the morning. We were glad we had secured our tickets ahead of time.","August 20, 2018",Fun but tour groups are large,11,"Baltimore, Maryland",4

We've toured through caverns before, and none was like Mammoth Cave. Don't expect shiny crystals or stalagmites and stalactites.This is a water-carved cave that awes you with its sheer size... Over 400 miles of cave, and the tours barely cover 2 miles! It's almost unfathomable, and that's the allure of this cave tour.","August 19, 2018",An educational workout,11,Sewell,5
Mammoth Cave,"Decided to take my three children (6,10, and 13 y/o) on this 4 hour tour through Mammoth Cave so that they could experience the same feelings of awe and wonder that I did when my father brought be there over 30 years ago. This tour is described as, ""very strenuous,"" and for me it was. For just about EVERYONE else on the tour, young and old, it was not. It is chilly inside the cave. Long pants and a hoodie are sufficient. It is nice inside compared to a hot summer day outside. At times, the tour sped through some of the best places where it would have been nice to go a bit slower. I was disappointed when we got to the Snowball Room and realized that we could not stop to eat our packed lunch. I remembered a small cafeteria and a lunch stop there as a child, and for some reason this was one of my most treasured memories. Bummer. The first half of the tour was easy. It wasn't until we got about half way in that I realized it was going to be more difficult, and by that point there really was no turning back. The guides do warn you of this, but for sure, until you are in it, it is hard to know. The same warnings were given when we took the Historic Tour, but we had no problems with that one. I'm a wimp, so most healthy people would probably be just fine on this tour. Believe it or not, it was easiest for my 6 year old. There are bathroom stops, which I recommend you fully utilizing if you have children (even if they tell you they don't have to go). There are also water fountains at one point. The tour itself isn't as scenic as some wet cave tours we have done in other locations, but it is still beautiful and still among the best cave tours I have ever been on. In fact, the only possibly better tour for us was the Mammoth Cave Historic Tour. Shorter, more scenic tours at other caves are great but sometimes forgettable. This 4 hour commitment is definitely NOT something your kids will forget. The real attraction for us to this cave and this tour in particular was the amount of time you get to trek through the cave. That is an experience you really can't have anywhere else. You go in, you commit, and you feel like you have accomplished something when you leave. At one point in the tour the guide turned the lights out. It was absolutely dark and completely quiet. There are stairs and inclines that are a little challenging. There are also areas with a somewhat steep decline where you need to hold on to the handrails. My kids were a little scared of that at first, but it was easy for them to manage. There are some drop offs, but the paths have handrails in the most dangerous areas. I won't take my kids anywhere I worry too much about them falling and am super overprotective. I felt okay with them on this tour though, as their father was there to help. The next day I woke up with some very sore and stiff legs. The kids were a little sore too! We were all still able to do another shorter tour the next day. I highly recommend this tour. It is worth the time and expense. You will create memories for your children that will stay with them forever. It might make such an impression on them, that they will return decades later, as I did, with children of their own.","August 18, 2018",Grand Avenue Tour,17,"Greer, South Carolina",5
Mammoth Cave,"We are active seniors: I'm 68 and claustrophobic husband Bob is 82. We chose the self-paced Discovery Tour in the morning- easy walk down 140 feet below with 2 guides along the way to explain the saltpeter mining and the Rotunda area. This is an easy introduction to the Cave system. After delicious Lunch at the Green River Grill right there, we went on the Frozen Niagra Tour 160 feet down- single file, hold the railings, duck down a few times to see wonderful drip-stone formations ( stalactites and stalagmites) within the inner part of this cave . Do go down the optional 50 steps to see the ""Curtain Room""= spectacular ceiling of swirling stone! The 2 guides are very interactive-asking us questions to identify what we see and explaining how the cave system works. This is a good tour for families and seniors- respected our abilities to walk and time to take photos on the way back out. It's a pleasant temperature down there- Fall jacket and jeans with solid tennis shoes do fine.The 3 gift shops are very nice- T-shirt and earrings for me, mug for Bob.","August 17, 2018",Fascinating world underneath your feet! -MUST DO!!,37,"Northfield, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"We came here and spent a lot of time between the indoor museum and the walking tour through the cave. The cave tour is a little tough.....very narrow and lots and lots of stairs to climb so beware. If you don't want to bother with that you can do a self guided tour that takes you into part of the cave which is a very dark short walk. I liked it though and then went back to hang while my boys did the 2 hour guided tour. They have a food area in the back (indoors). Also, buy your tours online. They were completely booked when we got there and plenty of people were being turned away.

Mammoth Cave,"We purchased tickets for the 10am Domes & Dripstones tour a few weeks in advance. We were coming from northeast to the cave and didn't realize the caves are located in central time zone...so instead of being there an hour early (we were told to be at least 30 min before start time to checkin) we ended up being 2 hours early. Our tour time was the only one sold out at that time so I asked the front desk if we could switch to an earlier time and thus they could resell our tickets to someone else....she said their reservations are different system/service and thus they'd have to charge us $3 per ticket for the refund...I didn't want to pay extra so we just looked around and did some shopping while we waited, we considered doing the historical cave tour because lot of people said that was good but decided to just do the one we had booked so we didn't feel rushed. wifi/recepiton throughout park is awful so have a map and plan ahead in advance. You can bring water on tour but no other food/drinks. Our tour was very full (3 buses) and I felt like we were rushed through and didn't really have a chance to look/examine any areas. There were people trying to take photos constantly and that slowed things for people behind them and then we were told to hurry up because the buses needed to get the next group, etc. 70% of the tour was just tunnels with varied sized rocks/boulders on each side of the trail and it wasn't really that cool until we got to the niagara area at the end. We were in that area for about 10 minutes and then the tour was over. We did not see any bats - only a couple spiders and crickets. Overall we really enjoyed the tour but it would have been nice to switch times and not be in such a large group where were were forced to move quickly. We also did the hike to the sink hole and were a bit disappointed with the end result. The park also have cabins, campsites, lots of other trails and a ferry - so lots of other things to do if you are willing to spend more time.","August 17, 2018",nice cave - make sure to plan ahead,112,"Bishopville, Maryland",4
Mammoth Cave,"I was here today with my 72 year old mom and boys (13 & 9). We chose the Historic tour and loved it! It was 2 miles and 2 hours long. I wouldn’t recommend it for any kids under 6, however. You do need to duck down in a few spots and there are quite a few stairs at the end. The temp in the caves is almost always 55 degrees, so be sure to pack a jacket. No food allowed, but you can bring water. I was very pleasantly surprised that they even had a bathroom in the cave about halfway through. It was spectacular! Although, it’s a dry cave, so you won’t see the stalactites and stalagmites that you will on the Frozen Niagara. ","August 16, 2018",Loved it!,1,,5
Mammoth Cave,"It was our first trip down to Mammoth Cave and we had no idea what to expect. Before our trip down we looked at the tour options and liked the Grand Avenue tour - because it basically included two or three other tours in it or covered the same area as other individual tours. The four hours / four miles scared us a little, but all four of us could handle it - two teenagers and two adults - basically they do stop or go at a pace that is good for the entire group. And when we went down, they did offer an 11 oclock tour in addition to the 9 am or 9:15 one, so we purchased our tickets ahead of time on line for the 11 am tour. But it is worth the trip and time and you maybe pleasantly surprised. Especially if you have never been before (like us) and have no idea what to expect on the tour or the Cave itself. And the rangers (tour guides) are really knowledgeable and make the tour awesome and interesting. (If I did not say it clearly - yes, purchase your tickets ahead of time (online if possible) because some of the tours do sell out) - thank you. hopefully this review is somewhat helpful - have a good / safe trip, if you go.","August 16, 2018",Grand Avenue Tour - Mammoth Cave National Park a good place to visit,9,"Clinton Township, Michigan",4
Mammoth Cave,"While I appreciated the sheer size and beauty of Mammoth Cave the tour itself was rather disappointing. I knew that the tour would be physically demanding but I did not anticipate having to speed walk through and not have many opportunities to stop along the route to take pictures. My son was also discouraged from continuing because he is a slower walker which was upsetting to say the least. We are grateful that Ranger Chelsea took him and my husband on their own private tour heading back. She shared a lot of great information and showed them areas not tour designated, it turned a disappointing situation into a positive so we are grateful for that! Both rangers were very accommodating overall with the situation but it felt rushed and not as intimate or informational as smaller caves in the area.","August 15, 2018",Grand Avenue Tour,0,,3

We felt the cooling from inside the cave, but did not venture down the steps into the cave. The park rangers were very friendly and helpful, and eager to accomodate us to the best of their ability...

I took a sweat shirt that I did not need. The cool cave felt good. It was hot and humid outside the cave. I am 61 and did not find it all that strenuous. My 30 and 14 year old did not find it strenuous. By the time I was done with the second tour at the end of the day I could tell I was on my feet all day and somewhat tired. Both tours were good but the Historic Tour in the afternoon had a lot of interesting features. We had an excellent tour guide for the Grand Avenue Tour named Jonathan. Spoke clearly, enthused and was knowledgeable. Our tour guide was good for the Historic Tour as well. Book your tours in advance. They were mostly sold out when we went to pick up our tickets.

Lady on phone today said 30 mins then turns around and says 15 mins not sure what it is. She then tells me they sold the tickets if you do not arrive 30 mins before tour starts then that is what I call double dipping. I did purchase tickets and the tour guide was nice and wanted me to tell a story of my experience. The front desk is the worst customer experience that I have ever encountered. The tour was 75 feet outside forming but they sold my tickets so I could not go! The cave is a joke just a dry hole very few stalagmites and stalactites no bats.

Mammoth Cave,"Before I get into this review the first thing you should know and do is to get your tickets for any of these tours online in advance. This is especially true in the summer because they can sell out way in advance. The park itself is beautiful, we noticed it had what looked like a beautiful and peaceful campground. There is also a hotel, restaurant, shops and a ice cream shop.  As for the frozen Niagara tour. You will meet at a pavilion outside the visitors center then board a bus for a short ride to the mouth of the cave. This is a short and very easy tour. There are a few places that you have to bend over and walk even for short people! You well see a few formations but if you have ever been in a cave it's nothing you haven't seen before. If you have never been in a cave or if you think you may have trouble doing stairs I would recommend this tour, or if you have young kids. Otherwise I would recommend taking the historic tour through the original mouth of the cave that is at the visitors center.","August 13, 2018",Frozen Niagara tour,146,"Locust Grove, Virginia",4
Mammoth Cave,"We did the self-guided (most of Historic) and Domes & Dripstones tours. The self-guided was wonderful, very few people and plenty of time to wonder at the marvel of the caves. The Dome & Dripstones tour downside was too many people, parents trying to amuse their babies or uninterested small children and those who struggled getting through narrow areas. I would suggest the NP put an age restriction and recommend closed toed shoes. The lead Ranger was very good, but you could see his frustration at being interrupted and having some people not follow basic safety recommendations (including avoiding touching the cave walls to prevent damage). If you are in good shape and interested in the caves, I suggest sticking close to the front with the ranger, unless you could be stuck behind people struggling to make their way. The Frozen Niagara at the end was a treat, very impressive.","August 13, 2018",Tour Options,88,"Raleigh, NC",4
Mammoth Cave,"We visited on Aug 10- Aug 12th, 2018. We camped in the Mammoth Cave Campground. We stayed in the nonelectric tent sites. The sites are well kept and have plenty of room so you don't feel crowded into other campers' sites. There is also ample parking for 2 cars at each site. Showers are at the front of the campground and were clean and water was hot, they cost $1.50 for 4 minutes. The bathrooms throughout the campground were also clean. We went on 2 cave tours- the Frozen Niagara and the Self Guided tour. Both were great and showed 2 different entrances into the cave and contained different information. They were both appropriate level for our family with a 5 and 7 year old. We also did one of the hikes that was about a 2 mile loop and takes you down by Green River. Both of the kids did Jr Ranger booklets which were informative. We ate lunch and got ice cream at the park. It was fairly reasonable and good. We did the quick lunch lines and skipped the sit down meal. At night we attended a ranger talk about bats which was interesting and informative. All of the rangers we encountered in the park were pleasant and informative. Be sure to book a tour before you arrive as the frequently will sell out.

You only walk a quarter mile or so, and there are not any extraordinary cave features. However, the ranger talks about a lot of the history of the cave.The best part was that there only were 9 people in our group.

Mammoth Cave,"This is my second Wild Cave Tour. The first was in 2009, and I returned as my daughter is now old enough to go (min age 16). Our guides were Ashley and Alisha and they were confidence inspiring, encouraging, and knowledgeable about the Cave and full of interesting historical tales about the previous visitors.You are now provided with coveralls, gloves, helmets, and knee pads and they were reasonably comfortable. Since they provide the gear, dress lightly (T-shirt and shorts), but bring sturdy over the ankle boots. Also a good idea to bring a pair of sandals. You are required to scrub down your boots after you exit the cave and it is nice to have another pair of shoes to wear while you do the cleaning.The tour itself is awesome. Apart from the Fallopian Tubes and the Birth Canal, this was a totally different tour than last time. The guides said there is a visitor who has come over a hundred times and he still sees something new each time. You do need a fair bit of upper body strength and you need to be willing to get a bit wet and dirty for this to really be fun. If you have any qualms about being claustrophobic, I recommend crawling under your bed at home a few times and seeing how you feel. Some of the passages are pretty tight and if you get uncomfortable in close quarters, this may not be for you. It is cool (58 F) in the cave, but you WILL SWEAT during this tour. It is strenuous with a fair bit of climbing up loose rockfalls, crawling on all fours and on your stomach, and walking hunched over through low passages, but overall, A REAL THRILL!! And you will feel a great sense of accomplishment when you finish. ","August 11, 2018",Wild Cave Tour,2,,5
Mammoth Cave,We took 3 cave tours in 2 days. Well worth the money. One of the tours did have a lot of people on it so it wasn't as informative and had to wait for stragglers. Make sure you can walk the 2 1/2 miles as it can be tiresome.,"August 11, 2018",Worth the price,6,"Scottsdale, Arizona",5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave was on our bucket list, so we were looking forward to the visit. Following the great advice here, we booked in advance (You MUST do this, as tours fill up - we arrived at 8:15 for our 9:00 tour and the day was already almost fully sold out, and our tour, the 4 hour Grand Avenue, was sold out.The cave system and history there was amazing to learn about as we toured the cave. The downside was when we realized there were 80 people or so on our tour (based on multiple busses to get us to the entrance). This kept us moving slow and really made it difficult to learn much from the Ranger other than the formal stops to bring the group together. The tour was like driving for four hours in stop and go traffic. Best bet, as others said was to stay near the front (after each stop, there was a mad scramble of folks trying to get towards the front)It was an incredibly dry cave, and having been to other caves and caverns, the sheer length and size is what makes Mammoth special. There are plenty of things to do, so plan on multiple hikes and time in the Visitor's center as well.We stopped by the Lodge at the end of the tour, and they had multiple food options that were reasonably priced, too. Tips:- Reserve in advance- Water only during the cave tours- Walk near the front of the group if possible- You need to be 16 YO to do the true caving/spelunking type tour, no little kids on that one (kind of a dissapointment for my 6' 15 1/2 YO who's caved before)- Arrive early in the morning and plan on the day- Hiking boots aren't necessary, but they are helpful. There are some spots that are slippery in the cave. Close toed shoes are required or they won't let you through the door of the bus to start the tour- It is cool in the cave, but we were fine in shorts and short sleeve shirt. Bring a light jacket or sweatshirt if you ""run cold"".","August 9, 2018","Magnificent, but overcrowded tours",18,"Fairfax County, Virginia",4

Mammoth Cave,"Extensive opportunities for a variety of tours at different levels of difficulty, but reserve ahead of time online. The easiest tour seems to sell out the fastest. The Dripstones tour is considered a moderate tour lasting about 2 hours. The guide was entertaining and informative, but does open the our providing an extensive warning about the perils of the excursion as a friendly warning to not take on more than you think you can handle. Mostly hundreds of stairs in cramped quarters with views of beautiful drops and potentially spotting a bat. Not to be alarmed, the stairs are study with secure railings and the pace is slow to moderate. I don't consider myself terribly athletic and found that I could keep up well. There were several young children on the tour that also navigated the route beautifully, but unfortunately the guide's warnings triggered anxiety in my teenage daughter which prompted her to wait behind at the visitor center. Had she come along, she would have experienced amazing views and stone structures. I recommend wearing comfortable, secure, close toed shoes. Especially because there is a shoe bath at the end that in a somewhat smelling swill which is quite necessary to prevent the transport of fungus out of the cave that may affect bats elsewhere.","August 8, 2018",Magnificent Mammoth,5,New Jersey,5
Mammoth Cave,"Important: If you wish to tour Mammoth Cave during the summer, Make a Reservation! Fortunately, we did. We arrived around noon Friday for our tour, and the information board stated that all tours for all times were sold out for both Friday and Saturday. No tours were available until Sunday. There were several families with no reservations that were not happy.The visitors center was extremely crowded. We had to circle around the lot a few times before we found a spot to park (and we were not looking for a spot close to the entrance). The rangers were all nice, and the prices in the gift shop were extremely reasonable.Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the tour. We took the two hour ""Domes and Dripstones"" tour. The formations at the end of the tour were beautiful. However, the first 1 1/2 hours of the tour was spent walking in single file, not seeing anything very pretty. Twice during the tour we arrived at open areas with benches for the 110 people on the tour. We would sit down while the ranger spoke about the cave for a short time. We then got up and walked in single file again not seeing much. Maybe I expected too much.Glad I went, as it is something I think everyone should see at least once, but will never go back (once was enough).Finally, we each wore a sweatshirt or jacket expecting it to be cold in the cave. However, we all agreed that we would have been fine in a t-shirt.","August 7, 2018",Make Reservations,42,"Charlotte, North Carolina",3

Mammoth Cave,"We stayed in room 318 of Sunset Terrace. It was a great location because it was far away from the crowds of the main lodge/visitor center and it was right next to several trails. Lots of deer and turkey wandered nearby our room in the evening. The room was nice and clean. TV only got a few channels but we never spent any time watching it. The cave tours are fantastic. We have done several over the years and this trip we only did the self-guided Discovery Tour because we had a baby and several people with varying abilities with us. This tour is a great intro to the cave for only 6 bucks. Make sure to get reservations for all other tours, they were sold out both days that we were there. The ice cream at the café was really good, but other than that the food was average and slightly pricey for what it was. We go to Mammoth Cave pretty regularly but this was our first non-camping experience, we will definitely do it again.","August 6, 2018",Sunset Terrace,2,"Lexington, KY",4

Mammoth Cave,"We had an incredible time at Mammoth! We did a fair amount of online research beforehand and selected two tours that covered completely different sections of the cave. The Historic Tour was a great introduction to the cave, and the Grand Avenue tour was AMAZING. Ranger Gregg was a wonderful guide, and the sheer variety in the different parts of the cave you go through is really astounding.I had been on a lot of tours of wet caves in the past, and I can definitely say that Mammoth is like nothing I have ever seen before. The size and scope of the cave is continually impressive and it is amazing to be able to go on a moderately strenuous hike entirely underground. And on top of that, the Frozen Niagara section of the cave is as breathtaking as any other wet cave I've been to!I can't stress enough how important it is to get tickets beforehand. They really do book up days in advance and you'll probably want to squeeze in a variety of tours.I also wish I had thought to bring a flashlight, which are allowed on the tours, particularly for Grand Avenue. The rangers both have lights, but a lot of the tour is following at your own pace and having your own light to check out the gypsum formations along the walls definitely enhances the experience.","August 6, 2018",A very different cave experience,0,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"I attended the Domes and Dripstones tour. The guided tour is about two hours long, including shuttles from the visitor center to the cave entrance and back. The best part of the tour, by far, was the entrance into the cave. For about 10 minutes, you wind down ~300 tiny steps, through extremely narrow passageways, around protruding rocks, through dark tunnels, and near dripping water, finally ending up at the bottom of the cave. The tour itself was just okay. You only see stalagmites and stalactites at the end of the tour for the last few minutes, but they are pretty remarkable. The rest of the tour you spend sitting on benches waiting for all the slow people in the back.There were over 100 people on the tour, which I felt was unmanageable for the guides and made the experience less enjoyable for me. Stay near the front of the group so you can actually hear all the history of the cave. The guides are really knowledgeable, but they will not wait for the whole group before starting to speak about a room, because they are on a tight schedule.Prior to the tour, the guides talk a lot about safety and physical ability, but I felt like they left out a few important items. I would not go on this tour if I were claustrophobic, very wide, or extremely tall. If any of those applies to you, you will likely find this particular tour to be quite uncomfortable, especially the steps down into the cave. Also, you should wear proper footwear with decent tread, as some parts are slippery, and carry long-sleeved clothing with you because the temperature drop from the surface is about 30 degrees (F) in the warmer months.Make sure to make reservations if you want to go on a guided tour. We went on a Sunday, and everything was sold out except the late afternoon tours. We bought our tickets online about a week in advance.Overall, the tour itself was a bit disappointing, but I'm glad I got to see the cave.","August 6, 2018",A crowded but memorable experience,9,"Baltimore, Maryland",4

Mammoth Cave,"This is a wonderful national park. The above-ground scenery is wonderful. We only took two short hikes, but they were very enjoyable. The cave tours were the most memorable. I recommend starting with an evening Star Chamber tour (with lanterns) to get a feel for how people visited the caves many years ago. We then followed the next morning with the Historic Tour which covered some of the same areas with more lighting. The Domes and Dripstones Tour was the most spectacular as far as cave formations.","August 5, 2018",Awe inspiring national park visit,15,"Decatur, Georgia",5
Mammoth Cave,"First of all, I agree with other posters that you really should get tickets ahead of time if possible, as almost all the tours were booked and full when we arrived (so I was thankful I already had ours). I also agree that it seems strange to wait in line to get your physical tickets (if you book online). I guess I don't understand why they don't have a separate line or kiosk available for people to get their tickets. Sp, as others have said, be prepared to wait at least 10-15 minutes in line. Also, they suggest arriving at the shuttle stop 10 minutes before your tour, and there is a visitor center with information to read. We arrived about 1 hr early for our tour and that allowed us time for the center as well as the ticket line and bus stop waiting. We went on the domes and dripstone tour. As we were warned, there were plenty of stairs (most of them going down rather than up) and there were also some tight squeezes. However they don't really tell you that you're going straight down stairs, so if you're afraid of heights, you might be a little concerned about the steep stairs. But, as long as you focus on the person in front of you, you should be fine. There weren't as many stalactites or stalagmites as I was hoping to see, but it was still impressive learning about the cave and seeing some of the rooms. However, they do pack a lot of people in the tour, so the pace depends upon them sometimes. I'm glad we had the opportunity to see this cave and have the experience.","August 4, 2018",Impressive!,115,New Hampshire,4

Mammoth Cave,"My wife and three kids visited the park over 2 days. The first day we spent hiking in the morning, having a picnic lunch, and then taking the Historic cave tour. The second day we floated the Green River in the park in the morning, had another picnic lunch and then took the Domes and Dripstones cave tour. It was all just awesome!We have a 9 and a 5 year old and while there are plenty of long, long hikes within the park, we stayed on the trails near the visitors enter so if the kids started melting down, there was always an intersection on the trail that headed back to the visitors center. We still ended up on about a 3 mile hike though. Floating the Green River was a lot of fun, several canoe/kayak companies serve the park. We used Cave Country Canoes and they were excellent. The cave tours really were amazing. The Historic tour takes you on a loop in and out of the historic entrance. One section on the cave known as “Fat Man’s Misery” is a winding path of tight cave space. It was fun that went right up to the point of being claustrophobic, but not crossing over. The Domes and Dripstones tour was more impressive. The start of the tour takes you down a winding path of staircases and then the tour ends with the Frozen Niagara formation that is simply amazing. All in all it was an excellent time at Mammoth Cave. ","August 2, 2018",Just Awesome!!,6,"Creve Coeur, Missouri",5
Mammoth Cave,"We had lots of fun at mammoth cave. lt was also very beautiful. Im very glad we went. Had a very nice time. Will go again. It involves alot of physical exercise so just make sure you can handle the tour you pick. Its well worth going. Double the benefit if it helps get you back in shape again. We were in back of a family with 3energetic young boys. After the cave tour 1 boy shouted they should race to the top where the stores were + he shouted- ready, set, go! None of the boys took off running. Lol. After the tour you will be tired. But dont let that stop you. Get yourself in shape better if youre out of shape + go enjoy yourself. We sure did.

Mammoth Cave,"I bought my tickets ahead of time to ensure we were on a tour. Despite this, we still had to wait on the line to pick up the tickets - poor setup there - arrive early. They should have a separate line for pickup only, this way everyone is not queuing together. We took the historic tour. There was a large number of people on our tour, making it impossible to hear anything the guide is saying if you are in back. In addition, throughout the tour, the guide barely stopped, which left little time to take any pictures. I understand they have a lot of visitors and need to pack in the people and rush through, but this did not make for a nice tour. However, given the large number of people, the walk up the stairs was very slow, so nobody felt they were holding anyone up if they stopped. The historic tour is definitely not too strenuous, despite the large number of stairs.Definitely visit the museum area in the visitor's center after (or before) the tour. It was quite interesting.","August 1, 2018",Beautiful Cave - Tour could be better,48,"Wappingers Falls, NY",4
Mammoth Cave,"First time at Mammoth Cave, and their website strongly suggested reserving tickets. Glad we did, because they were sold out of most tours for the day when we got there. We did Domes and Dripstones and Historic tour. The historic tour was basically: here's some really long underground tunnels discovered. Turn off your light- yep, its dark here. Used to be a mine, been used for tours ever since. The website hinted there were more historic points than were ever mentioned in the tour. Since theres not much to look at, the tour guide really makes the tour for the historic one. Ranger Rachel loves theatrics, so she was really good. For the Domes and Dripstones, there's more to see. Recommend for sure, with the last bit being the main reason to go. In the tours, the guides say stick to the front so the slower people can set the pace. The entire time I was trying to stay close to the guide, but everybody still walked so fast, you spend most of the time trying to play catch up. That definitely took away from the experience. No idea why people are in such a hurry to pile up and wait. But the pace for all the tours was very unpleasant. I had to say, screw it, I'm gonna walk extra slow so I can actually enjoy the experience, so then I was alone in the cave, away from the guide and whole group. Overall, glad I went, but it's definitely a one time visit for me.","August 1, 2018",Reserve tickets,4,"Cleveland, Ohio",4

Mammoth Cave,We visited the park in June. I had done some online research and booked our tours about a month ahead of time. When looking the tours probably didn't get close to full until about a week before and by the time we got to the park for our 10am tour they were all sold out. So buy ahead of time! We did the Historic Tour in the morning and enjoyed it with our 12 year olds. We wanted them to have the historical background of the caves and area. It was a perfect tour for that. It is not the tour if you are looking for the stalagmite and stalactite formations. We saw more of those on our second tour. In the afternoon we took the Domes and Dripstones tour. This was the tour where we saw more of the cave formations at least at the end. The beginning was a lot of stairs and some kind of tight spaces. Not the tour for people with limited mobility or fear of tight spaces. Our family loved it! The end was where you got to see the beautiful cave formations. Definitely worth the extra stairs at the end so be sure to go down. We had a nice and affordable lunch in the restaurant there and enjoyed an ice cream cone in the afternoon. We were glad we made this stop part of our vacation.,"July 31, 2018",Great National Park Experience,14,"Saginaw, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"First time back to Mammoth Cave since I was young and boy did it not disappoint. We checked out the NPS website to read about the options then checked Trip Advisor for reviews and most information was close to accurate. I want to include a very detailed listing for those who are considering opting out for physical limitations, or level of fitness, or even because of children. The main self guided tour which is available is a great way to ease in. (Make sure to purchase all cave tour tickets in advance as they do sell out every day and buying once you arrive is slim to 0 chance you will get any of the other tours outside the self guided option) The self guided tour takes you around back of the visitors center and down a pretty significant incline. (Yes you do have to come back up and there is a shorter but more rigorous stairs option to the lodge we took.). You descend into the cave down a few hundred stairs, you have to also climb back up, and once you get into the cave itself it's pretty amazing. Don't miss this opportunity. If you can climb a few flights of stairs, you can do this tour. Just take it slow. No need to hurry back up. It is worth it. Not a lot of formations in this ""Dry Cave"" as I've been told it's called. The next tour we did was the Domes and Dripstones option. You wait at the shelter with purchased ticket then board buses with about 100 others. You drive a short 5 or so minutes to the entrance ( a door in the side of the hill) and then start the descent. I will say if you are claustrophobic, or you have severe health or heart issues, DO NOT ATTEMPT. This is a very enclosed space with tight areas (I am not thin by any means, and larger or hippy people can fit sideways, so don't let this deter you) and you will go down approximately 250 feet by the time you finish the stairs. You go slow as a group and we never felt rushed. They move the slowest people to the front to set the pace and we ended up in the middle somewhere, but it was perfect. There are approximately 3 stops on the tour where the guide informs you of the geology and history and our guide was fantastic. Actually all the park staff and bus drivers were amazing. The ticket sales people not so much, but hey if that's the only part of the experience that was just eh, we can deal with it. After the first main stop, you then start ascending, and I was a little nervous, but they made some switchbacks and going up isn't nearly as bad as we thought it would be. It's very slow ascending and you get the option at the end to go down another 100 steps or so to see the dramatic stalagmites and stalactites. DO THIS PART of the tour. This is what really impressed us most. The amazing features in this part of the cave were so impressive and neat. Since Mammoth is known as a dry cave, these formations are hard to come by. So all in all, it's an intense tour, but so very much worth it. I saw children ages 5 and up do this. I may have even seen a smaller child being carried the whole way (kuddos to that dad) but we also saw some small children turn back, so consider this tour before taking your children some 250 feet below the surface. Also, they say over and over again that health issues or emergencies in the cave could take up to 4 hours transportation time from extracting you to getting you medical attention. You are in a very remote part of the state, with no close by medical facilities....make sure you consider this before booking. Bonus tips - Parking is good but limited by visitors center. The lodge is directly before the visitors center and you can park in that lot and take a short walk to the visitors center - it is seriously a short walk. Also, the lodge here didn't look as nice as some other places we've stayed in the past, national park wise and it's super busy all the time, so consider this before booking.","July 31, 2018",Domes and Dripstones Tour Was AMAZING!,12,"Bloomington, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"Did two tours in a day, both the “historic” tour and the “domes and drip stones” tour. Both were quite enjoyable, though I’ll admit I enjoyed the guide for the historic tour more. The other tour guide rambled a bit and some of his information didn’t make much sense if you know anything about geology and science. I will say, though, that both tours are moderately rugged. You need to be comfortable walking quite a lot on uneven surfaces that may also be wet, both tours have LOTS of stairs AND slopes, and frankly, in some spots, if you are really tall and/or really wide, you may struggle. I’m very tall at 6’4” (196cm) but not super wide, and there were a few spots that were a squeeze. And I spent fair amounts of both tours hunched over. Plenty of other tour options may be available, some easier, some more rugged. Also seems to be a fair bit of above ground stuff to do, like hiking and biking trails. There’s a small lodge onsite, camping, a couple of restaurants and plenty of gift shops. Picnic areas are also available.Overall, I had a great day here!

Mammoth Cave,"My family has toured a whole lot of caves! About the best thing Mammoth has going for it is 'it's big'. There were probably 100 people on our Historic Tour. You can imagine how difficult it is to keep 100 people together. The ranger was good when we could hear her. Too many people talking at the same time. Also, at points in the tour some of us lagged behind the front of the group due to slower people in front of us. By the time we reached the next stopping point, the ranger was finished with the talk and we heard NONE of it..... It's so dark that you can't enjoy the cave because you are having to watch where you are stepping or rushing to catch up. Some of the areas are tight and low head room. But, we were warned ahead of time. So no surprises there. Maybe we picked the wrong tour. There was nothing really interesting about it. I wouldn't recommend it........ We have been to so many better caves! Go to Carlsbad. It was great!","July 30, 2018",NOT in my top 10,2,"Cedar Park, Texas",2
Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I decided to do the historic tour as neither of us had ever been here and we had heard it was a good tour for first timers. We also had our children with us (ages 4 and 6) and they thoroughly enjoyed it. I would not recommend this tour for any child under 4. There are lots of steep, narrow, sometimes slippery steps to traverse. The tour in general was nice and somewhat informative. The cave itself is very plain and there’s not a ton to see so if you’re expecting something like Carlsbad caverns you’ll probably be disappointed. The sheer size of the passageways, the history and the fact that it’s the longest cave system in the world is what makes this cave so interesting. Now onto the bad... I felt the tour was very rushed. Which meant when there finally was something to look at we felt we couldn’t slow down much to look for fear of slowing down the group. We were in a group of about 100 and it was split 30/70. With the people practically power walking through (30%) to keep up with the ranger in the front and the people walking a bit slower in the back (70%) with a huge gap in between. Since we had younger children with us naturally we were towards the back. The only times we would be able to catch up to the front group is when they would stop for the ranger to give a history lesson. But by the time we arrived she was already well into her talk which meant we missed portions of 2/3 of the stories. I have a hard time believing it was a time issue as we finished our tour a full 20 minutes early. At the end of the tour both my husband and I felt more than a little disappointed. The park is beautiful but we wish we would’ve been able to enjoy the cave more and not felt like we were just herded through as fast as possible.I do think that if they cut down the tour sizes it would help to alleviate the rushing issue and no one would feel like they missed out on anything as we did.","July 30, 2018","Beautiful National Park, Dissapointing Cave Tour",1,"Evansville, Indiana",3

Mammoth Cave,"Got our tickets for the 12:45 Saturday tour one week before and it said there were still 65 left. Thank goodness we did. We got to the park at 10:00 am and ALL the tours for that day were sold out!Don’t let the “moderate” rating scare you from this tour. I’m in my 50’s and out of shape, but had no trouble on this trip. You descend fairly quickly, and with some amazing views. The ascent is broken up with a few stops and low incline paths so it was never that strenuous. Some of our group did feel a bit claustrophobic but got over it quickly. There is an optional 49 step descent at the end of the tour which is absolutely worth taking. It’s where you’ll see some of the best drips. The 49 steps back up we’re not tough at all. Most of us were in t-shirts and shorts and we were fine, so if you forgot your light jacket you’ll be okay.

Mammoth Cave,All I can say is book early!!! We booked about 5 days ahead of our visit. Many tours were sold out at that time. When we arrived all tours were sold out Tour has a lot of walking. There are 2 places that are a bit scary but doable. It’s a tight squeeze and you have to squat down for about 50 feet or a little more. There are about 180 stairs that you have to climb back up.,"July 28, 2018",Historical tour,16,"Miami, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"Buy your tickets well in advance!!! I had a group of 5 to purchase for and I waited until a week before the tour date...I thought that was plenty of time. Nope! We took the Historical Tour because it was one of the only ones that was a reasonable length that I could get 5 tickets for. That being said, it was a good tour. There are almost no cave formations on this tour, which was a bummer for my kids, but it was still a fun tour. My kids especially enjoyed Fat man's Misery. The group was HUGE, which made it difficult at times to hear the guide from the back. I wouldn't recommend this tour for very small children, it is 2 hours long and compared to other cave tours, is relatively boring as there isn't much in terms of ""cool"" formations. As an adult, I appreciated the historical information and the sheer size of the cave. I very much enjoyed this tour. I would DEFINITELY go back, I would just make sure to book my tickets WAY in advance to be sure I can take a tour that's more appropriate for my kids. (ages 9, 7,7) They have 2 gift shops with different items, so make sure to check them both out! We didn't have time to do any trails, but we did do the junior ranger program, which my kids really enjoyed.","July 28, 2018",Book your tickets in ADVANCE!!!!,27,"Eau Claire, Wisconsin",4
Mammoth Cave,"This place truly is amazing, but be warned: it is BUSY. Do your research and book the tour you want several days in advance. We did Domes and Dripstones and saw some AMAZING sights. Do not take this particular tour if you are not in decent shape because there are a lot of stairs and tight low spots, particularly right at the beginning. It pushed my claustrophobic nature for a bit. Do not take children who are easily frightened (there is a period of total darkness—don’t worry, it’s safe) or who are too young (a toddler cried literally the whole time on our tour when the guide stopped at the specified intervals to share information.) Be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes with good grip. The tour says 2 hours, but that is inclusive of the ride there and back. Get ready to get some exercise and be amazed!","July 28, 2018",Domes and Dripstones,50,"Atlanta, Georgia",4
Mammoth Cave,At the bottom of the website it says reservations are strongly recommended. I ignored that and it was a mistake as all tours were booked for the next 2 days . However they have a self guided tour of the historic entrance which took us about 30 minutes to complete and then we did a short hike. It was not enough but it was still really amazing. ,"July 28, 2018",Awesome visit ,7,"Sylvania, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"We are a family of 4 (2 adults, kids 4&5). I did a lot of research and chose not the easiest cave tour, but obviously nothing too hard. We did Domes & Dripstones, bought our tickets online ahead of time. We were there a Wednesday in summer and the place was wayyyy busier than I expected. The line to get tickets was long at 8:45/9am. We hiked a loop to the Spring, then up Green River Trail, then back Dixon Cave. It was nice, but nothing spectacular that you'd be sad you missed. The ""river"" was very dry and trees overgrown so not much of a ""view"". Picnic tables are not by the visitors center, but in a separate area, so we opted for a picnic under a shady tree by visitor center to avoid driving to a different area. Buses for our tour met right by the visitors center and there was announcements for the tours and nice pavilions you gathered at before departing. The tons of stairs at the start of Domes&Dripstones was the best part of the whole cave to me, so don't let that part scare you away from this tour. You can go somewhat at your own pace, we preferred the back of the group. You have the ""caboose"" ranger to talk to and you're not rushed. The group only stops together about 3 times through out the tour for a talk, the rest is walking&exploring. At the end of the 2hours my kids were hungry and pretty done, but still I'd recommend for preschoolers! JR Ranger program offered here. Overall a good day trip park. I don't think more than 1 day is needed unless you're older and can/want to do multiple tours of different parts of the cave.","July 27, 2018",Tour Better than Expected,22,"Toledo, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,Did the historic cave tour which was fantastic. A casual pace tour that didn't make it seem that the difficulty level was moderate. We booked our tour online which is highly recommended.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth CaveI took my 10 yrd old niece to mammoth Cave on a Monday. We arrived about 15 minutes before the visitor center opened. We were not in any rush since we had reservations for the Domes & Dripstones and the Historic tours. Once they unlocked the doors, we went in and looked around the 2 small gift shops and retrieved our tickets from the ticket desk. One quick observation: The ticket desk is quite busy. People should really have an idea of what tickets they want to buy before getting to the front. We got stuck behind a couple who did not have reservations. They insisted on asking the ticket lady questions about the tours. She told them they need to go to the information desk. He guy did not really like that answer so they just bought one of the available tours. I mean seriously, this is 2018. Can’t you do a bit of research before just showing up?Our first tour was the Domes and Dripstones tour. We were to meet at shelter B at 8:40. We arrived early and got a nice shady spot to wait. The ranger shows up and gives a small briefing about the tour. They explain the number of steps and how if you are injured or can’t finish the tour it will take hours to get you help. They loaded everyone up (about 80 people) into 4 buses and off we go to the New Entrance to the cave. It was a short trip and once we arrive we all walk down a short path. Here the ranger is standing in front of a metal door just sticking out of the side of a hill. He goes over the rules of the cave tour and in we go. It is a very steep and narrow staircase down to the bottom. My niece was scared at first but was fine once we arrived at the bottom. It was on an odd descent as you had to duck under rocks sticking out over the staircase. Being inside the cave was quite spectacular. It was a cool 54 degrees, dimly lit, and very dry inside. We walked to a large room where they had benches. Here the ranger explained why the cave is dry vs wet and how it was formed. It was very informative. We left this area and walked on some more to the next stop. Really these stops just allow the large groups to stay together. It is amazing how the group gets spread out so fast. The last stop was the best formations the cave system had to offer. Here was saw Frozen Niagara and the Drapery Room. I was able to get some great pictures with my small point and shoot camera on low light mode. In all this tour lasted about 2 hours with about 1:45 actually in the cave. Upon returning to the visitor center, you are dropped off at the lodge where you must walk across some cleaning pads to control the White Nose Fungus problem affecting bats. We had a quick bite to eat then off to our second tour.Our second tour was a much larger group filled to the capacity of 110 people. We met at 11:25 at shelter A. Same deal, the rangers go over the expectations and off we got on a hike down the hill to the original main cave entrance. We decent stair into a large opening in the size of the hill. Upon entering you understand why it is called Mammoth Cave. These chambers are massive. We walk along a dimly lit trail of pavers and make a couple stops along the way. Eventually you make your way through Fat Man’s Misery and Tall man’s Agony. Here you weave your way through very narrow and low hanging passages. It was quite an adventure. Eventually you reach a gathering area 310 feet below the surface. Again this allows the group to come back together as one. Finally we walk to the exit which is a 150 foot fire tower inside the cave. There were some great views of the cave as we ascended the tower. Once at the top it was a short walk to exit the cave. In all this was a great day trip from Louisville. I had not been to Mammoth Cave since I was my niece’s age. The rangers do an excellent job telling the story of Mammoth Cave. The tours, food, and gift shops were all surprising affordable. Everyone should make this a stop at some point of their life, especially if you live within a couple hour’s drive.","July 24, 2018",Quick Day trip From Louisville,121,"Louisville, Kentucky",5
Mammoth Cave,"After having seen some of the bigger, more famous caves and caverns around the country, Mammoth Cave, at least the portion accessible to the self-guided tour, is not very grand in size. It does, however, possess its own beauty and is well worth the time and effort necessary to see it. Well worth the drive from the interstate to get there.","July 23, 2018",Mammoth Cave,57,"Hinesville, Georgia",4

You are free to drive and hike as you see fit without expense.We booked our cabin reservations months in advance and loved the experience of being in the park.W booked two tours.....WAY IN ADVANCE....like the website recommends. The Historic Tour and the Domes and Dripstones were fantastic along with the rangers that guided us. The groups are large...I recommend being up front so you can ask questions.We took in three evening programs as well. These are near the lodge and were very educational.The hiking was good as well.

Mammoth Cave,"Lots of reviews here, so all I can say is WOW, don't miss this place if your into outdoor activities or even a history buff. I took the self guided tour as well as the Domes and Dripstones tour, both excellent, HOWEVER I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the Star Chamber Tour, its an evening tour with lanterns only, and gives an EXCELLENT overview of the history of the cave and some of the more interesting features (lots of them!). We stayed at Nolin Lake State Park in our Rv and drove to Mammoth in our rental car-great place about 30 min away by Ferry-about an hour if you have to drive around to the main entrance of Mammoth. Nolin had electrical and water hookups and a boat ramp for those that want it. Also good fishing at the dam just a few miles from the park.

Mammoth Cave,"Let me start out by saying, the cave is very nice and well maintained. We did the historic tour, which had three stops to discuss the history. Would try another tour if in the area. Now, the bad. The main tour guy was rude. He fussed at us because we was late to the first stop because the guy taking our tickets was slow! Waaaaay too many people on each tour (120 people to 2 guides is too much). We literally had to RUN at some points to catch up to the group all in the name of keeping on time. How dare we stop and LOOK at something on a tour. And our tour finished TWENTY MINUTES EARLY! So, if you like running thru caves and not getting to really look at anything, this is for you!

Mammoth Cave,"We loved the park and felt it was rewarding and worthwhile.I generally think the tours were ""too much talking and then running to keep up"". The guides are friendly and well-educated, but each tour was about 50% talking and waiting for the group to catch up. In Domes and Dripstones, I resented that we spent 30 minutes talking about limestone and carbonic acid (and whether it is like Coke) and then were told ""keep the line moving... hurry we are late"" when we finally got to the dripstones... we were yelled at if we stopped for 10 seconds to take a picture. This could have been the best tour, and ended up just being frustrating. Boredom followed by disappointment.""Historic Tour"" is the most bang for your buck. It has some physically demanding parts, but it is no tougher than mowing the lawn with a push mower in those parts. And it was terrific. It had the best balance of talking versus scenery, and fat man's misery felt like the wildest ride in the park.. it was a real adventure.Star Chamber tour was not worth it. The novelty of carrying hand lanterns wore off, and these were some of the most boring parts of the cave... basically just walking through a big hallway.The gift shops and restaurants were all great. I'll review the restaurants separately. The staff were well trained, friendly, and welcoming. If I lived nearby I would return to take one of the river tours later in the year.All in all, it was well worth the trip. I do wish they would change the tour formats to reduce the talking and increase the time to see the best parts, but I feel I got my money's worth, some real education about geology and history, and some adventure unlike what I get in other National Parks. This is worth doing. We spent 2 days in the park and that felt just about right.","July 22, 2018","Well worth doing, but with some concerns",57,"Atlanta, Georgia",4

I tried to book the longest tour a few months earlier, and it was already sold out. So instead I booked 2 shorter tours, one in the morning, one in the afternoon, but it worked out great for us. I think I would do the same next time.","July 21, 2018",Incredibly beautiful!,79,"Cleveland, Ohio",5

When we got there tours were sold out until Sunday and we had not read anywhere that you needed to book ahead of time until we got there and read it on a map (that you would only recieve upon arrival). The staff at the visitor center was not helpful or friendly and had no sympathy to the fact that many people seemed as let down as we were to have driven all that way and not be able to receive a tour. They were still selling the self guided tour which is only 3/4 of a mile. The park itself was nice and there is good hiking, but when the goal was to see caves we were definitely not pleased with the outcome.

Mammoth Cave,"I thought I would write this for anyone who has limitations or like me, was afraid of the description of Fat Man’s Misery on the historic tour. I’m a big girl and I’m married to a big guy. I’m not the most out of shape I’ve ever been, but enough that I was worried about the steps and squeezing through the tight spaces of the guided tours. Side note- I later spoke with a Ranger that said she’s never seen anyone get stuck on a tour. We were also on a tight schedule so we opted for the Discovery Tour. It was awesome! For $6 each, we were able to enter the cave at our own pace and view several areas close to the entrance of the cave. There were Rangers stationed there to answer questions and drop some cave knowledge on us.The walk down to the cave entrance is downhill, paved and shady. There are several steps that lead into the cave entrance. Once in the cave, the walkways are partially paved and partially bumpy rock/dirt. It is pretty easy to negotiate the walkways. No steep climbs, but not completely flat either. It is a low light environment, so someone who has very little vision (like my grandmother) would have some difficulty. There are some spots where you have to watch your head. I’m 5’7” and didn’t have to duck, but someone much taller just needs to pay attention. The temperature was about 55 degrees and it hangs around there most of the time, so people who are sensitive to cool temps, should dress accordingly. There are a few primitive exhibits to view, however it doesn’t take long to get through the whole thing. I believe it took us about 45 minutes to look at everything. I really enjoyed it. I also really appreciate the time Ranger Elaine took to answer my questions! Remember when I said that the walk to the cave entrance was downhill? Prepare yourself to walk all the way back up! The good news is that there are benches if you need to catch your breath like I did. It’s really not that bad of a walk.Overall, we really enjoyed the experience and recommend it.

Mammoth Cave,This was a fascinating 3-hour 3-mile tour by kerosene lanterns into non-electrically illuminated areas of the cave. I would recommend walking shoes - people on the tour with smooth soled sneakers had trouble on inclines. Not every adult gets a lantern so try to get a lantern or walk close to someone who has one.

Mammoth Cave,"Having knees that can be tweaked, fear of heights & slightly claustrophobic- I tightened my gut (took a Rolaid) and went on this tour. Actually thought of backing out when the Ranger went over all the warnings about physical abilities a couple of times. Well worth it and not as bad as many of the descriptions. The short bus ride brings you to the entrance....stairs that turn every few steps and go straight down. There are 2 railings which was great (I took no pictures - as I was always holding on). It was very interesting, lots of questions can be asked and answered - there are 2 spots where we all sat down on benches for this - that was great. The cave starts out narrow, then widens, then narrows again at the end. There are spotlights throughout the tour. If I am ever back in the area again I don't think I'd hesitate to do another of the tours. The one we took was 2 hours (probably 1 1/2 hours in the cave itself).

Mammoth Cave,"Awesome place to go and see, indescribable natural caves in the middle of nowhere in a huge beautiful national park. The area is not build up around the park and no restaurants to go to, the restaurant at the cave didn't look like much. We took The historic tour with 100 people with mostly younger families with children, we are 67 and were the oldest in the group. We are in shape, but I wouldn't go into the caves unless you are. Slippery places dimly lit, some very small passages where you have to bend down and almost turn sideways. You can't watch your steps close enough because you are mainly rushed through and then stopped for long periods of time to hear the tour guide talk. The tour was 2 hours but could have easily gotten through in an hour, too many stops and not enough ability to see enough of the cave along the way. Will go back to go on more tours, it was a spiritual experience. The entrance to the historic cave was a Mammoth cool wind coming at you that was refreshing 55 or 60 degrees as it was a hot July day. The cave temperature was the same throughout and damp. You need proper shoes and a light sweater if preferred. I wouldn't go into the cave without a hat on as water from the ceiling drips down and my husband had something fly and hit his head, maybe it was a bat but they are rare in the cave.","July 16, 2018",AWESOME,13,"Summerfield, Florida",4

Mammoth Cave,"Went on two tours - Historic and ""Domes and Dripstones"" and stayed in campground.Tours were excellent but somewhat strenuous, the latter a bit bit more than the former, IMO. Rangers were helpful, friendly, entertaining, and knowledgeable both in visitor's center and on actual tours. I recommend making reservations in advance, as several of the time slots were filled. Be prompt as they run a tight schedule. Comfortable clothing, good shoes and a jacket or sweatshirt is needed. Children can participate in Jr. Ranger activities. Senior pass good for discounts on tours and camping. Lots of parking for vehicles and RVs. There are some restaurants on site. Also have a hotel and cabins that I cannot comment on.Campground is clean and within walking distance of cave tours (outside camping is at least 5 miles away). But there is no electricity hookup at almost all sites and just a few water stations here and there. Dump station and more potable water on the way in or out. Small camp store with mostly souvenirs. Nearest store appears to be Dollar General in Cave City, about 7 miles away. Restrooms clean (and air conditioned!) About equal number of sites pull-through loops and back-ins. All sites asphalt paved. Lots of tenting, so use Google maps satellite view (or equivalent) to select a site with some level grassy spots if this is you. Most sites heavily wooded, but the trees don't really get in the way. The check-in closes at 5 pm and self-check-in following that, look for reserved sites on their number posts. Not very full, even in high-season when we were there. The only thing I wished they had was electric, but it tended to make it darker and quieter, that is OK.

These tours hold a large group, so she did a wonderful job with all the kids, families and adults in the group and I felt like it was something everyone enjoyed.

There was also one section where if you are a little thick in the hips then you had to turn side ways to pass. This tour does have many steps and you do go down approximately 325 feet below the the surface. There are no stalagmites or stalactites on this tour.

Mammoth Cave,"Definitely make reservations in advance of your visit. It is a very busy park. We went on the Historic Tour. The guide was very well informed and worked at engaging the group. This is not a tour for beautiful rock formations, it is an historic tour. Great for history buffs. Not too strenuous, only a couple of slippery spots. Otherwise, pretty easy. They tell you they are no bathrooms on the tour, that is not true. About 2/3 of the way through the tour we came to a gathering area with benches and there were bathrooms. Probably not a good tour for young children. There were some on our tour and they were restless as there were no outstanding rock formations to look at.","July 9, 2018",Historic Tour,43,Kalkaska,5

Mammoth Cave,"A stunning display of stalactites and stalagmites, columns and draperies BUT the tour is far too short on time. It's easy for the young and old with only 6 steps and a slight ramp. I wish they gave you more time in the cave. Short bus ride from the visitor center. Book your tickets before you arrive in the park - weeks in advance to get a good time slot.","July 9, 2018",Frozen Niagara Cave Tour,1,"Baltimore, Maryland",3
Mammoth Cave,"Really liked the Grand Avenue Tour. Hiked the Buffalo Creek/Sal Hollow trails and spent a night backpacking. Friendly people and helpful park rangers. Definitely worth a visit.We had a miserable experience on the Historical Tour of Mammoth Cave. The underlying problem is that the tour caps at 110 visitors with 2 rangers. Though there are a plethora of warnings about the distance and obstacles encountered, the group was constantly separated because of visitors' inability to navigate stairs or lack of awareness that cave floors might be uneven and dimly lit. Tour includes typical cave experiences - Fat Man's Misery, Tall Man's Agony, complete darkness and silence (except for the people who turned on their cell phones and wouldn't stop talking). This tour is 2 hours and 2 miles long and had only 3 stops that were no more informative about the history of the cave than the signs at the park. Would recommend the Self-Guided tour +/- a longer or more intense cave tour.","July 9, 2018",Really hit or miss experience,22,"Louisville, Kentucky",4
Mammoth Cave,"I always wanted to visit this cave from the time I was a child...I choose the short and easy tour..because I was on the road. Very interesting..to see the diamonds and the drips...Warning keep up with the tour guide,,, listen to what they tell you to do, and walk carefully...It is dark in some spaces...but very safe cave. They have a room to watch a movie about the caves and a bookstore. Not recommended for very small children or adults with walking problems to go inside cave...but the other things are great for them.","July 8, 2018",Nice place for History Bluffs...Wear your good walking shoes,11,,4
Mammoth Cave,"We made reservations two days prior to our visit - ALL tours were completely sold out the day we arrived so it's a good thing we made reservations. We were in a truck and 5th wheel camper and although there were lots of RV parking spots - they were entirely filled with regular cars. We ended up in the overflow parking and were allowed to park along the curb with a few other RVs. It was 100+ degrees so we didn't try any of the many wooded trails. There is a cafe, shops, and bathrooms inside the visitor center area. There are a few displays to check out inside but don't set aside more than 30 minutes for it. Our Historical Tour met on time with two rangers and over 100 other people. You are given info about the difficulty of the tour (must be able to squat down and walk like a duck for about 15 yards at a time). There are over 500 stairs throughout the tour but not all at once. I thought the hardest part was walking back up the hill once we came out of the cave. We saw a few people really struggling getting up the hill. The cave is very cool but we were fine in shorts and T-shirts. I'd wear good walking shoes and ones with some grip would be helpful. It's clean inside the trails so you shouldn't get dirty. You stop throughout the tour to hear information about the cave. The ranger did a great job and was very passionate (her name began with a K and she's been working there for almost 20 years). Some areas in the cave are huge open rooms and others are tiny walkways that you have to turn sideways and squat down. There's no elevator or hidden escape route. We highly recommend this tour for anyone who can physically handle it. It was awesome hearing the Echo River rushing behind us over 300 feet underground. If we are ever back in this area, I'd go back and try a lantern tour.","July 8, 2018",A Must-Do,61,Cranberry,5

Mammoth Cave,"We have traveled through many caves, but this is in the top five! Positive notes: Great tours and great park rangers - these guys love their jobs and love this cave and it shows! We had two rangers on each tour and they were all great! We saw large rooms, small, tight canyon paths, stalactites and stalagmites (very large display), dry cave and wet cave areas. Nice grounds, counter service and table service restaurants on scene and an ice cream bar. We wanted to picnic, but didn't see any tables close to the park visitor center, but that was fine, just needed to rest nearby between tours. Areas for improvement: None to mention! Loved it! Important things to know:Book your tours before you go - almost all of the tours filled up within an hour of our early morning arrival - we booked before we wentTake note of tour recommendations - when they say you will need shoes with treads that means real treads - so make sure you sneakers have themWe took the Grand Avenue Tour - this was 4 hours long and 4 miles. We walked at a pretty steady pace, making stops after strenuous parts - there are many steps and several steep inclines and declines that required use of a rail (even my teens worked hard). We saw every aspect of caves - dry cave, wet cave, large rooms, small canyon trails, everything - great tour, but note the time and distance because you will be tired afterwardWe then ate lunch on the grounds, got ice cream and rested and then did the Violet City Lantern Tour after lunch. - This tour is completely by oil lantern light - we LOVED it! every 4-5th person carries a lantern and you travel completely by this light. We saw a lot of large rooms, primitive people artifacts and learned a lot of history of the cave. We went 3 miles and it took 3 hours. You travel at a good pace and the last portion has areas of incline and decline, also irregular steps made out of rock. At the beginning, you walk on concrete pavers, but then you are on packed cave dirt the rest of the way. It was so neat to see the group of lanterns in the darkness. Some younger children were a little hestitant (maybe around 7 years old, but they did ok) some parts can be scary as it is dark and there are ruins of buildings and tales of ancient inhabitants. We did both tours in one day - 7 miles total, but many steps and inclines / declines. We are in our 40's and our kids are teens - we all did ok, but we all got winded after some parts. * wear good -tread shoes - we all wore sneakers* carry a couple of bottles of water in a back back* plan to walk quite a ways at a stead pace*book tours before going * caves are around 54 degrees year round - you may need long sleeves/light jacket - but have around 80% humidity (although the cool air makes it unnoticeable)","July 6, 2018",Wonderful cave offering many views! - Great rangers and staff!,46,"Houston, Texas",5
Mammoth Cave,"We enjoyed Mammoth Cave National Park several years ago, so this time we came with our adult children and our grandchildren. We took the Domes and Dripstones tour and the Historic Tour. Both tours were great with knowledgeable rangers. The caves are cool, so be prepared with a sweatshirt or sweater if you get chilled easily. Also, good walking shoes would be advisable. I would strongly recommend making cave tour reservations before coming and also following the directions to the park on the website. (The website cautions against using just GPS directions.)","July 5, 2018",Return visit,24,"Jenison, Michigan",5

Nice gift shops good water filing stations and plenty of restrooms. We did the domes and drip stones tour meet ranger go over rules short bus ride maybe 10 mins to cave entrance. The first part is 240 steps down really cool single file and really neat! The ranger will stop 3 different times to share history and info. St one point they turn out all light really cool!

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave Historic Tour was awesome but so was the hiking around the cave area. The cave is massive. There are not the same stalagmites and stalactites as in many caves but it is still beautiful and amazing. Be sure to take a light jacket and wear good walking shoes. They said this tour could be strenuous but we found it pretty easy to get in and out of the various tighter and lower spots. It is slick in some places, especially some of the steps so use the handrails.","July 5, 2018",Wonderful park,1,,5
Mammoth Cave,"We visited the amazing Mammoth Cave National Park in July 2018. We did the Grand Avenue tour. We had two adults and two teenagers. Highly recommend this particular tour as it gives you a good value for your money and time and experience. We only had half a day to spend here. This is not for anyone who can't climb, gets winded easily, need assistance, or children who don't like walking or the dark. Our cave ranger was great and informative and it is obvious he loves what he does. I only used my jacket for a short time and was actually sweating a bit at the end. The cave stays at 54 degrees.I would recommend wearing comfortable pants, short sleeve shirt , shoes with good tread ( a must), and some water.

Mammoth Cave,"Ok so my 13 yr old son and husband wanted to see this on our way to FL. I am 55 and not the most athletic. Plus I do have a tendency to be claustrophobic. So when we actually made reservations (which I highly recommend) I was a bit nervous. I ended up absolutely LOVING it! The Domes and Dripstones tour was awesome! If you tend to be claustrophobic, stay to the front of the pack. It helps because you don't get as bunched up and things tend to seem like they are more open. You do go down 280 stairs to begin with but they're going down so its no big deal if you just focus on what you are doing. The entry way isn't really spacious but you end up having certain spots that open up so you're not that closed in. The majority of the tour is pretty wide open spaces and beautiful. There are a couple of really close entry ways to get to the next stop but you are not in them from very long. Its like you are just going through a very narrow doorway and then open to another big room. Because you are in the front you kind of set the pace and you end up in these resting areas where you wait for the others to catch up, which is nice if you seem to be winded. I know that they say there are 500 steps in the place but it didn't seem that to me really and remember I am NOT athletic. :) At the end of the tour is the Frozen Niagra, absolutelly beautiful! It is worth going the additional steps (49 to be exact) to get to the bottom of the wonder and look up! Gorgeous! I got some spectacular pictures! and worth the trip back up the stairs. :) I really didn't see any cave crickets until the very end and unless someone pointed them out to you or you looked closely at the walls you probably wouldn't have seen them. The whole tour was 2 hours just like they said from start to finish.I have done the Historic Tour before, so my husband told me. I really don't remember alot of it the only thing I do remember is that I was disappointed because I didn't see stalagtites and stalagmites. I will remember the Domes and Dripstones tour forever! My son was so excited he wants to go back and do more the next time we have a vacation. Oh and it tends to be cool down there so bring a sweater if you tend to be the chilly type. :) Hope this helps!","July 2, 2018",Domes and Dripstones are well worth it!!!,8,"Novi, Michigan",5

Mammoth Cave,"The most unique thing about Mammoth Caves is the opportunity to visit some extraordinary underground structures. From stalagmites to stalactites, from long narrow passages to cavernous rooms, it’s all there. Of course only a small portion of the 400+ miles of caves are open to the general public. If you’re coming between mid-May and late August, reservations are a must. Reservations may be made online months in advance. Easily the most popular tour is the Frozen Niagara Tour. In about 90 minutes one sees the most spectacular structures without much effort. Needless to say, it sells out first. This tour runs regularly from 8:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. in the summer. We took the Grand Avenue Tour. It incorporates the entire Frozen Niagara Tour and much more. However, it is four hours long and strenuous. Yet, one sees far more variety of structures. I have written a separate review for this tour. The cost is $30.00 per adult. There is a 9:00 a.m. year round and an 11:00 a.m in the summer.What else is there to do? Miles of hiking/biking trails rim the park. Animal watching abounds. We saw the following animals: deer, snake, turtle, wood peckers, turkeys, lightning bugs and raccoons. There are also above ground tours, along with traditional, ranger-led programs. Accommodations include camping (tent and RV). There is also the Lodge at Mammoth Caves. Be careful, the regular hotel rooms don’t have air conditioning; you could boil. We stayed in the historic cottages, which do have AC. The Sunset Terrace rooms also have AC. Cottages are $93 a night, while the Terrace is $136 a night. Warning ....the Woodland Cottages don’t have AC either.Food options are limited in the park. The Green River Grill is a traditional restaurant. Most dinners are under $20. All dinners are served with unlimited fresh biscuits and jam (really good). The food was better than most park fare. There is an ice cream shop, also good. Next to the ice cream shop hamburgers, hot dogs, and assorted sandwiches are sold. Caution, other than the main restaurant, the food shops close promptly at 5:00 p.m.The employees and rangers are incredibly helpful and positive. Additionally, the park was filled with interesting and civil people. A great place for young and old. Mammoth Caves is more limited recreationally than places like Yosemite and Yellowstone, hence the 4 out of 5 rating. This isn’t a one week trip; it’s more like a two or three day trip.","June 29, 2018",Much to See and Do,35,"Los Angeles, California",4

Mammoth Cave,"I had a hard time deciding which tour to do, especially when they start talking about all the stairs. For us, the stairs were really not a problem. We did the Historical Tour which lasted 2 hours. We had Ranger Grace who did an excellent job of explaining what we were seeing and adding a bit of humor. You do move at a steady pace, but it is not difficult. Most of the stairs on this tour were at the very end. I believe it was 15 flights of stairs at one time. Fat Man’s Misery was not bad. I hit my knee, but I was trying to take a picture so it was my own fault. I am about 5’6” and I did have to duck down in some sections. If you have back problems you might be uncomfortable. On almost all the cave you are on a path, not going over rocky ground. Make sure you book your tour before arriving. I did notice our tour was sold out with the exception of the very last tour at 3:30. If you have children, they will enjoy doing the Junior Ranger program. They just need to pick up a book from the Rangers. On completion they can earn a badge.

Mammoth Cave,"You need to purchase your tickets in advance for this tour. I waited until one week before our trip and was not able to get in to the 9:00 weekday tour so we went on the 11:00. There are only two Grand tours per weekday. We were there early and checked to see if there were any cancellations or no shows for the 9:00 but even if someone no shows they cannot sell you or trade you in to their spot. There were about 80 people on this tour from probably ages 9 ish up to 65 ish. There were a lot of stairs and a few of the hills certainly get your heart rate up. I read some reviews that said the tour was fast paced but ours was intermittently so but enough that at times I definitely had to take my jacket off. The males in our group did fine with shorts and a t-shirt. This is a dry cave and so it does not have the formations that somewhere like Carlsbad does. It just has miles and miles of pathway and is really pretty neat but not a lot to look at. I barely took any pictures. You do go through different formations of rock such as tubes and canyons etc. There are two bathroom, water fountain breaks and no food is allowed in the cave. You are allowed to carry in water. Note that the timing of the tours, 9 & 11 will mean you need to eat well, before you go in. The lighting is dim but that kind of adds to the atmosphere while also making some steps be steps of faith. In some places the dirt is so hard packed that it is slick and on one portion of pathway you really will need the handrail on the steep slick walkway. We were ready to be done by the end. As someone that likes to hike I would have enjoyed it better with a much much smaller group and much quicker paced. Overall, I do recommend this tour, though. One point about the parking is that it is not extremely big rig friendly. We were a 42 foot unit pulling a 20 foot trailer. If you don’t get there early and have the whole parking lot to work with you will have to make some short tight turns to get in to the RV section of the lot.

You must adhere to what is written on the website or you will be very lost.****I took my 2 children, aged 9.5, and 4.5 in the historic tour. I would not recommend taking a child younger than 4 on this tour. 1 mile of hiking down in to the cave and another mile hiking back up. My 4.5 year old did great until right at the very end, and then she really wanted to be carried. There are over 500 stairs, and lots of tight, low places. I was a bit surprised how many times I was crouched over at the height of my 4 year old through this tour. Someone had brought a 2 year old. This child did nothing but bother the rest of us the whole time. He cried and whined and yelled, making it difficult to hear the ranger. Don’t bring your young children on this tour! They won’t be happy. I also recommend being as close to the ranger as possible, even though we were moving at quite a fast pace, we were able to hear what he was saying.

The rangers are friendly, funny and delightful. Full of information. The cave is huge, hence the name and there is something for everyone. Tours fill up quickly so I suggest calling and reserving THE DAY BEFORE to ensure you get the one(s) you want. They say all tours are every day but that is not necessarily the case and they do fill up quickly. There is a souvenir shop, restaurant, and really cute 50's style ice cream shop.

Mammoth Cave,My husband and I did the Historic Tour on June 18th. We are in early fifties. We enjoyed it. The tour was moderate. It did have about 500 steps. The climb at the end of the tour was the hardest part of the tour. Straight up fire tower stairs ! Like five stories ! It was a task! Well worth it ! The cave is amazing!

Mammoth Cave,"I didn't realize how many tours were offered at Mammoth Cave and had trouble deciding so I called for a recommendation. I was only planning a day trip but with the recommendation I received, I ended up staying at the Lodge for two days (wishing I planned to stay the week). I took the Grand Avenue tour which is the longest and most extensive guided group tour they offer. This tour is 4 miles and 4 hours long and intersects with a few of the other tours. I also took the Historical tour, 2 miles and 2 hours long. The Park Rangers provide a very informative overview of the caves and are very knowledgeable. I thoroughly enjoyed the extensive knowledge and passion of the Rangers. And Just a taste of these tours left me wanting more, I wished I planned to stay the week instead! The food at the Lodge was amazing too, I highly recommend eating there on your visit! Check out their website, it's very informative on the activities offered and getting advance reservations for tours is a great idea, there is limits on tour participants.","June 21, 2018",Mammoth Experience that makes you want more,11,Ohio,5
Mammoth Cave,"I came here when I was a child, and a few years back I decided to take my two children on a day trip to take a tour and it was one of the highlights of their summer. We have been visiting annually for the past 2 years and have done several tours including the historic and domes and dripstones. Our favorite was the violet city lantern tour, though the others we have taken were very educational and interesting as well. We plan on taking all the tours they offer over the next few years. It is wonderful to have a national park so close to home. ","June 21, 2018",Love Mammoth Cave,65,"Georgetown, Kentucky, United States",5

Great guide and beautiful sights. Two hours total. I recommend this tour over the "" historic tour"" which is less scenic. Historic tour shows huge rooms a and huge pathways but the drips and domes shows you the beauty inside the cave. I disagree with others about the food in the green river cafe. It is decent food for the price and very convenient. We ate there twice and found the service good and prices very reasonable for a park.","June 20, 2018",Domes and drips,0,"Madison, Wisconsin",4

We took the first Frozen Niagra tour of the morning and arrived 25 - 30 mins early. The line was slow even with reservations, we just made our tour time. The tour we took was appropriate for smaller children, we had a toddler with us. The Froz n Niagra tour was just the right for the amount for the time we had and our group. Very informative guide.

Mammoth Cave,"We visited Mammoth Cave in early June and went on 2 different tours- Domes and Dripstones and the Historic Tour. First of all, as others have said, purchase your tickets online in advance. Tours sell out! Most tours were already sold out when we arrived at the park, so I am glad I followed the advice of reviews I had read. The 2 tours we did were both really good. We had great Park Ranger tour guides. I can't remember the woman's name, but she has been at Mammoth for many, many years. She was very knowledgeable and gave a great tour. Our main guide for the Historic Tour was Ranger Jim. He was awesome! He was knowledgeable with a great sense of humor. It was a snarky, quiet humor and he was hysterical! I highly recommend going on a tour with him! Plan plenty of time to arrive at the park. It is off the beaten path from the highway and the tours will leave without you if you are not at the appointed place at the right time. We were staying in Louisville and had allowed plenty of time to travel, stop and get sandwiches for lunch to put in the cooler we took, and also took into consideration the time difference. Louisville is on Eastern time; Mammoth Cave on Central. It took so long to get the sandwiches at the Subway we stopped at in a truck stop that we were almost late to the first tour! It was very stressful, but we made it, but with only a few minutes to spare! So, if you think you have allowed enough time, add 30 more minutes to it to be safe! Mammoth Cave is a tremendous national treasure and everyone who is able, should go see it.","June 19, 2018",National Parks rock!,9,,5

The 1st was Frozen Niagara. This part of the cave is still active and the limestone is still forming. The 2nd tour was the Historic. This tour begins by entering the main entrance. Most of the rooms are dry and already formed. The guided were excellent and extremely knowledgeable. There is lots to do at the Park.","June 15, 2018",A National Park must see,17,"woodstock,ga",5
Mammoth Cave,"We reserved tickets for the 10 am Historic Tour and were glad we did because when we arrived, it was sold out. We took this tour to show our 7 year old grandson what a real cave looks like - and he was not disappointed. We had so much fun, even in a group of over 100 people. It was a 2 hour tour covering about 2 miles of the longest cave system in the world - very impressive. There were some narrow staircases, and some tight places, but mostly we walked on pathways covered in paving stones - so it was not too difficult, although there were times when part of our party lagged behind and took a bit to catch up. The ranger stops at intervals to talk about the history of the cave and its many features. He also answers questions. This tour goes through a dry part of the cave so you will not see any dripstone - that is on a different tour. It is very chilly in the cave, so be sure to bring a sweater or jacket.","June 14, 2018",54 degrees and 690 stairs - Well Worth It,25,"Sauk Village, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"With about a week to go until traveling to Kentucky, we found that there was very limited availability for cave tours. I had read all of the tour descriptions and needing a tour with limited steps, we opted for the Frozen Niagara and the Accessible Tour. We started the Accessible Tour at 12:45 - only 14 people are allowed for this trip which makes the group size nice. We caravanned to an elevator and went into the cave. The pathway was paved and easy to navigate. This is advertised as a 2 hour tour but with limited questions, we finished about a half hour short. This is a dry cave - no frills, but the tour was nice and comfortably cool. The walk was short wth many breaks - only about 1/4 mile. After the Accessible tour we ate lunch at the grille and walked about the visitor center, which is very nice and clean. Even if you cannot get a tour, the information and the walk to the historic cave entrance is well worth it. The Frozen Niagara Tour started at 4:15 with only 35 people capacity. They bus you to the entrance across the park and you enter down a ramp unto the cave. There is only abut 12 steps on this tour which is easy, then you have an optional 98 steps if you choose to see under and behind frozen niagara. There are some tight spaces and about a 50 foot stretch to bend over and walk through. All was pretty easy, and worth it. On this tour, you see much more formations than just the accessible tour. This tour lasted a little over an hour. The Rangers are very knowledgable and friendly. Keep in mind that you really research tours before you go, as they almost always sell out and some tours overlap areas within the cave.","June 14, 2018",Frozen Niagara and Accessible Cave Tour.,30,West Virginia,5

Mammoth Cave,"We spent 3 days in the Cave City touring the Mammoth Cave along with Diamond Caverns and Crystal Onyx Cave.Before I arrived, I booked single tour at Mammoth Cave for each day. Since I did it few days before our arrival, I spent couple hours on trip advisor.Per reviews, we booked Violet City Lantern Tour, Domes and Dripstones, Star Chamber Lantern tour.Since I ordered tours at home, all I had to do is to pick up my tickets at the visitor center, and it was a breeze. Great service, and not that crowded.. even on weekend.Overall, the visitor center is great, clean, has free informational tour, 2 small gift shops.We bought Christmas tree ornament to remind us of trips taken with the kids.Day 1- Violet City lantern tour was 3 miles long, interesting, but my kids were not thrilled about ""dry"" cave. They wanted to see formations. Great educational tourDay 2- Domes and Dripstones tour was really good, but with alot of people... I mean alot. Many formations to see in the Draper room. Tour guide Jeff was fun, and everyone enjoyed it. Definitely recommended.Day 3-Star Chamber lantern tour... this is where our family started to wonder... why are we doing the same path twice??Let me explain..Violet City tour goes through full path of 3 miles entering main cave at visitor center...Star Chamber goes through half the path entering main cave at visitor center... , then turns around, and makes a pit stop on a Gothic avenue. Was it worth it??hell yeah.. we were actually more satisfied with the relics and history of the cave on the Star Chamber tour, over the Violet City tour. The guide, Elizabeth, did a great job, our teenage kids were really into this tour... even though it was pretty much same path as day one, but the Gothic avenue is full of things to see..So this brings me to the reason why Mammoth Cave gets 4 stars..Why can't I see the map of the cave trails before I order tickets?I have 3 days.. I should have done Star Chamber, Grand Avenue and Domes and Dripstones.. maybe historic.. this would cover majority of the paths available to see.For the adventurous, like us, we would book Wild Cave - 6hr tour way in advance.. Lesson learned.We will most likely visit the cave again, but we know the map, and what we want to do.. bucket list of Grand Avenue tour, and Wild Cave.I am attaching picture of the cave trails I took at the information desk.. I hope it helps you understand which path you are most likely to take... not the best quality, but it might help when calling your next reservation. Good luck","June 12, 2018","MAP!

Mammoth Cave,"K- so I'm going to say this with honesty. Please don't complain about walking on a walking tour you paid for. This excursion is extremely strenuous- It was sad being surround by people that had a hard time walking. I get that America is out of shape- but it's not hard to walk... This is a MUST DO for any out of town'er that's ready to get in it and explore! We did the 4 hour one and wanted to try the 9 hour hike but we ran out of time. Also, don't be afraid to bend down to fake tie your shoe to snag a rock for your memory box! DOGS- Dogs are not allowed in the Cave- BUT they have an on site kennel that cost us $7.00 for a 4 hour stay!!!! You go to the lodge section and check them in the front desk- it's that easy!","June 11, 2018",Great walking tour! DOGS OKAY! Read details below.,13,Texas,5
Mammoth Cave,"We did the Historic Tour. The size of the cave was impressive but for the most part you just walk around inside a big hole in the ground. I have been in other smaller caves with more impressive rock features, e.g., Tuckaleechee in Tennessee. The Mammoth Dome at the end of the tour was the most impressive feature.The downside: The large, noisy, often obnoxious, tour crowd and uncontrolled children. They sell up to 110 tickets for each show. That's a large crowd. At the beginning of each tour they give an overview of cave rules. One was no flash photography. If you want to see how much that rule is ignored simply look at the photos posted on this page. An elderly fellow in front of us was carrying a large bright flashlight. He asked if it was okay to use that light and the ranger said no, only in an emergency. Despite that, the jerk flashed it all over the place until I made him stop. At one point in the tour, the ranger turns off all lights to demonstrate total darkness. Cool except for all the idiots clicking on their cell phones for light. Ruined the moment.And the uncontrolled children! It was awful. One youngster kept yelling ""ECHO!"" over and over every time we entered another room. His parents thought it was cute and funny. The dozens of teenagers in the crowd yakked loudly and nonstop for about 2 hours about anything but the cave: school, boyfriends, girlfriends, cars, whatever. It was often difficult to hear the ranger speak about features in the cave.I think it would be a better experience with smaller tour groups. Maybe the other tours have smaller groups. Also, would be nice to have a 21-and over tour but I can see how that would not be feasible. There is also the choice of a self-guided tour which, in hindsight, we may have taken rather than the over-crowded and noisy guided tour.The exhibit in the Visitors Center is well-done and very educational. I would highly recommend going through the exhibit before going into the cave. You will have a much better understanding of how the cave was formed and its commercial development.Finally, make advance reservations for any tours. We had no clue about the large crowds that visit the Park and almost missed out on any tour. There was only one time slot left when we arrived and had to wait for two hours.","June 10, 2018","Loved the cave, hated the large tour group and noisy, rowdy kids",48,Tennessee,3
Mammoth Cave,"Took the drips & domes tour. Most of the tour was ordinary cave walking, including a steep descent on narrow, wet, stainless steel stairs w/a number of low ceilings.

It lasts about 30 minutes. The cave is about 54 degrees. It felt great on a 90 degree day. There was a small cafe and ice cream shop on site. Both terribly overpriced.

Mammoth Cave,"We spent 4 days staying at Mammoth Cave NP on vacation and really enjoyed our stay! It seems like it is a somewhat overlooked National Park which is beautiful, and has interesting geology and history. There is a very nice museum at the visitors center. We did several tours - Domes and Dripstones, Historical, and Star Night Lantern tours. Each tour took us to different parts of the cave system, had different history and we saw different features. Each tour has a guide and all of our guides were very good, informative and entertaining. The Domes and Dripstones tour ends in a part of the cave with stalagtites and stalagmites. It was beautiful! The historical tour starts at the historic entrance to the cave and you really get to see the size of cave and where the name comes from. The lantern tour was in the evening and we carried lanterns into the cave instead of using the electric lighting. Our guide was excellent and we really were able to get a sense of what it was like for early settlers exploring the caves. Tips: Purchase your tour tickets early as the tours do sell out. Read the tour information as it will tell you how many steps are on the tour and which part of the cave you will see. You get to see Frozen Niagra on the Domes and Dripstones tour. The rangers will tell guests as part of the safety talk to consider any physical limitations. There are over 500 steps in total, up and down, on the Domes and Dripstones tour. When existing the cave be prepared to walk over what they call bio-mats, which are just foam mats with Woolite and water. Guests have to do this to prevent the spread of white nose fungus which is killing the bat population in the cave. You will want to wear closed-toed shoes.Be prepared they do not allow flash photography in the cave.","June 6, 2018",Longest cave system in the world!,14,"Jacksonville, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"We have toured a lot of caves and enjoyed seeing Mammoth Cave but the tours could be better. Unlike many cave systems Mammoth Cave has few formations (stalagtites, etc.) to see. It is very big and you can go for long underground walks through big rooms and tight ""hallways"" and down narrow winding stairs. We took two tours - The Historic tour and the Domes and Dripstones tours. If your goal is to see formations take the Domes and Dripstones tour. The good - the guides were very friendly and entertaining. The not so good - the tours were very large and most of the people couldn't hear the guides except at specific stopping points. Also the guides missed a lot of opportunity to teach - On the Historic tour the guide couldn't answer any questions about geology or basic cave info and didn't point out the only active formation. On Domes and Dripstones the guide didn't explain about the formations. She listed a few types of formations that we would see but didn't explain what they were or where to find them and since you aren't with the guide most people missed the smaller types of foramtions. So you may want to learn about the different types of formations before you head out on the tour.","June 5, 2018","Big Cave, Big Crowds, Little Education",4,"Dallas, Texas",4

Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I visited Mammoth Cave the last week of May. We took the Domes and Dripstones tour with Abigail and Corey. We arrived around 11am on Thursday morning and bought our tickets just 10 minutes before the start time of 11:30 am. I don't think we would have been as lucky if we arrived later in the day. The tour lasts about 2 hours with a ten minute drive to and from the entrance. You walk 3/4 mile. The temp is in the low 50s and damp. I was OK wearing shorts and a tee. This may not be the tour for you if you're claustrophobic. I'm sort of claustrophobic and wasn't sure what to expect. Abigail, the park ranger, briefed me before I bought the tickets, and said I could stay up front with her if I was uncomfortable. I didn't because I felt better in the middle of the group (over 50 people on our tour). There was also a ranger, Corey, at the rear of the group. You go down over 200 hundred narrow stairs to start the tour with some narrow passageways along the tour but it does open up in spots as well. Abigail stopped twice at open seating areas to talk about the cave. I ended up being OK. Abigail even asked how I was doing during and at the end of the tour. Overall we loved the tour. Abigail was informative, engaging and personable. Corey didn't lead the tour but he was knowledgeable as well when asked questions. It was incredible to see one of nature's creation up close especially the stalactites and stalagmites at the end. I'm glad I overcame my fear and went on the tour. I definitely recommend going.","June 3, 2018",A must see when visiting KY,14,,5
Mammoth Cave,"The most important bit of information I can share with anyone planning a trip to Mammoth Caves is to buy your tickets in advance. I waited until a week before our trip, and almost everything was sold out. The Lantern Tour was on the top of my list, but because I procrastinated, we were unable to do that tour. Guess that means we'll have to go back!! :) Second, read the descriptions carefully and heed their warnings about health. We did Domes and Dripstones and not only did it have an abundance of stairs (mostly down), they were also quite tight in some spots. The kids and I loved that part of the tour, but that sort of thing isn't for everyone.Wear comfortable shoes and bring a light jacket.Also, the Mammoth Caves website warns about GPS directing people in the wrong direction. Pay attention to that too!! I printed out the park's directions from their website. Our GPS was fine until we took the exit, and then it tried to send us in the opposite direction that the park said to go. Thankfully, we followed the park's website directions, and we arrived on time with no problems.I highly recommend visiting Mammoth Caves and spending at least a full day there. 2-3 days would be better as each part of the cave we toured looked drastically different from each other.","June 2, 2018",Buy Tickets Ahead of Your Trip,12,"Sulphur, Louisiana",5

Mammoth Cave,"This cave is huge! You have to see it to fully grasp how huge this cave is. Certainly worth a 2 - 3 day trip to visit. This is a very unique park and most activities are centered around the cave however there are some really pretty hiking trails on the topside. As all other reviewers have stated, book tours ahead of time otherwise you may not get the time or tour you want. Once you get to the visitor center you will still need to stand in line to pick up your tickets (the line seemed the longest between 11 - 2pm). The tours are very organized and start and finish right on time. Also the cave stays around 55 degrees so bring a long a light jacket. It's such a great place to visit during the summer b/c you can escape the hot and humid weather. It also doesn't matter if it's raining since you are underground.We took 3 tours; lantern tour, self-guided and domes and drip stones.Lantern tour - highly recommend this tour especially if the park is crowded b/c they limit it to 38 people. You cover about 3 miles and there are some neat surprises along the way. The rangers do a fantastic job leading the tour. This was about the maximum time we would want to be in the cave with younger kids (there a no restrooms)Self-guided - this is so easy and quick i recommend it so you can spend the amt of time you want at each spot. Domes & Drip stones - totally different than the other tours, this is a wetter section of the cave so it looks very different. The entrance and first section is pretty tight and you are with a group of 120 or so people so if tight spaces bother you the first section might be tough. Once you get thru the drip stones it opens up (about 1/2 way). I am not fond of a bunch of ppl crammed into a small area so we just waited and were some of the last ones in the cave and i did fine. It's worth it, a great tour. We stayed at the Woodland Cottages. They are very, very basic. I recommend a small fan and cooler. It was nice being so close to visitor center.","May 30, 2018",Fun Family National Park Trip,22,"Charlotte, North Carolina",4

Do take heed of claustrophobia and warnings about strenuous walking during some of the tours. You will be disappointed if you don’t get to go any further than the self-guided tour.

If you can only do one, the Historic Tour (I think is it called) is the way to go . It is pretty easy and covers most of the things that are cool to see. If you cannot do the Wild Cave tour (best option but lots of crawling, Reservations required) then I would suggest the Historic Tour, Domes and Dripstones and the violet lantern tour. However watch the times and buy tickets in advance. Also try to go at a non-crowded time.

If you want to see the cave, this would be at least a two day stay. The cave is very, very, very large and groups are kept small so people can see what is happening in the cave.","May 27, 2018",wonderful park,91,oklahoma,5
Mammoth Cave,"The longest cave system in the world, but not on par visually with many others across the country. This is a diverse cave system, and there is enough variety of things to see depending on what tour you chose (there is a lot here that is monotonous and underwhelming). Unlike many National Park cave locations, this one has multiple openings to gain access.We chose the “Frozen Niagara” and the “Cleaveland Ave” Tours, and they offered us an excellent overview of some of the various things to see at Mammoth. On these walks we got to see many of the varieties of cave offerings here. We found the Rangers to be knowledgeable, and personable. Both tours required a bus ride there and back from the Visitors Center.The Visitors Center is as nice as any you will find anywhere , and the grounds are well maintained. This is a nice facility. The various gift shops are well stocked with the usual tee shirts and hats, but also quite a bit of local craft items. Note: this is the first place I have seen boxed (not plastic) bottled water - a nice touch.","May 22, 2018","Yes, It Is The Longest",294,"The Villages, FL",4
Mammoth Cave,"Came to the Park on a hot day in May - the tour was fantastic! We took the tour for ""Fat Man's Misery"" - I'm a 6ft tall BMI of 29 and I had no problem getting through. The tour was very interesting but mostly on your own - the guide only spoke 4-5 times during the whole 2hr/2mile trip. MAKE SURE you go to the bathroom before the tour starts.

Mammoth Cave,"I love mammoth cave....we are a 4 hour drive away so not terribly far. This is my third time. We did the domes and dripstones tour which was excellent. Our ranger was hilarious and had so much knowledge of the cave. The tour itself was fantastic...I had never been to this particular entrance to the cave, so it was neat to go in through a bunker door instead of the walk in historic entrance. There were quite a few stairs and a few smaller spaces, but it was just a lovely tour. I brought my 12 and 10 year old children to mammoth for the first time and they had an absolute blast. Afterwards we cooled down with some ice cream from the ice cream shop that was delicious and went hiking. As each time we have been before, we saw all sorts of wildlife...pretty butterflies, fun chipmunks, different birds and squirrels, but most magical was the herd of deer that came out of the woods just a few feet from us, and were not scared of us at all! We could have literally reached out to touch them! That made our day. We also took a drive down to the green river ferry and rode that because I think no trip to mammoth is complete without a ride on the ferry :) Mammoth is magical...and I can't wait to go back!","May 21, 2018",Domes and Dripstones,14,"Lafayette, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"Of the gems in the US National Park system, this is also a UN World Heritage site. This a worthy visit for a full day. It is easy to find one's way around and it is well organized.Cave tours are graded on difficulty before one must make a choice for any particular tour. Domes and Dripstones is a good two hours and about 500 steps of stairs going down at the entry. Worthy of note, it is recommended to reserve a tour days in advance if it is during a busier time of the year.I enjoy looking at the churches that remain of the displaced residents from the formation of the park in 1941. Historical information is related and the sites are well maintained by the National Park Service.Stay on marked trails. Seriously.

Mammoth Cave,"We spent two nights in the Woodland Cottages located inside Mammoth Cave National Park. We went on 3 different cave tours. One tour entered through the Historic Entrance. One tour focused on Frozen Niagara - a short tour that features all the stalactites, stalagmites and unusual formations not found anywhere else in the cave. We also took an Accessible Tour because one of our family members has difficulty with mobility. We recommend any of the tours offered. If you can take a couple of tours - like one “standard” tour, plus the Frozen Niagara tour, that would be ideal because you would get to see two totally different looks at the cave. The hotel next to the visitor’s center has a wonderful cafe and restaurant, an ice cream parlor and a couple of great gift shops.

Mammoth Cave,"My wife and I took the Domes and Dripstones tour which lasted two hours including a 5-10 minute bus ride both ways. It covers a number of the areas included in shorter tours. The walk was about 3/4 mile and included roughly 500 steps of which 325 are down (my estimate).The temperature is a constant 53 degrees F. I was comfortable in a short sleeve shirt, others had jackets. There are two seated stops in the tour where our guide explained the geology of the cave. He was very interesting to listen to. Between the temperature and the planned stops, I see no reason why a reasonably healthy person cannot complete the tour.The last part of the tour was magnificent with astounding stalactites and stalagmites everywhere to be seen.

Mammoth Cave,"We drove to Mammoth Cave from Chicago in 6 hours and spent 3 days taking tours in the caves. The caves are so massive that the Park offers tours of many different segments of the cave system. Each one offers something a little different. All of the rangers leading the tours mixed humor with hard information about the geology and history of the caves. You can see massive underground rooms, navigate through narrow passages, and view magnificent stalactites and stalagmites. it all depends on which tours you take.","May 14, 2018",Great National Park Right Here in the Midwest,16,"Wilmette, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"Not being much of a geology person, it is difficult to understand how huge cave systems like Mammoth get formed. According to the internet, most of the cave is made of limestone. Limestone is a very soft rock with a hardness of 3 on a scale from 1 to 10 (10 being diamond.) Nature's process follows: - as sediments of fish fossils float to the bottom of a body of water, layers are formed. - through pressure and temperature, the outcome is limestone. - finally, the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere mixes with rainwater. - it is this carbonic acid that dissolves the limestone to create caves.","May 14, 2018",Nature's creation of caves?,129,"Fredericksburg, Virginia",5

It was incredible and I’m so glad we did it!! This park was a unique and totally different experience from other national parks that we have visited. I feel especially fortunate to have had Ranger Jerry as our guide because he is a direct descendant of one of the original explorers/guides. His knowledge and love of the cave were obvious, and we felt honored to share 4 miles over 4 hours with him and hear all about the history of the cave and his family!

Mammoth Cave,"Superb adventure! The longest cave system in the world, over 405 mapped and surveyed passages. We will need to go back since our Domes & Dripstones Tour only covered .75 of a mile! But it was 2 hours long and it was simply Amazing! This tour was indeed ornate as the tour description suggests with amazing stalactites and stalagmites, and the fact that you basically walk down square spiral stair case in a open column in the earth is just WOW! The only cave life we experienced were the cave crickets hanging out on the rocks. I didn’t quite know what to expect and I was impressed and intrigued all at the same time. The steps that allow you to take this tour are incredible. Incredible that they allow you to walk this tour, incredible that they built these steps in this environment and incredible that they used the passages that existed and didn’t really cut into the rock to make it work, they made it work. So with that said you have to duck and move your body around and aside of cave rock on either side of you. If you are claustrophobic probably not the tour for you but there are many others. At one point I felt like I was walking in the canyon of the crescent moon (Indiana Jones fan here) and on a Goonies (favorite flic ever) adventure all at the same time. At one stop along the tour lights out and I was amazed that I could not see my hand in front of my face. To experience the absence of light is pretty darn cool. To experience the silence was so calming, although we only experienced the silence for a moment when to Tour Guide asked everyone to be quiet. The only thing that was a bit annoying was that half of our tour group of about 100 was a group of school kids, they were noisy and obnoxious and never shut up. I know I know it is a public event, but it might be nice if they gave those groups that large their own tour times. There is a lot to experience here inside the earth, 250 feet down, the quiet, the serenity of a space like this, not quite fully experienced with noisy school kids in your group. I loved this Tour and want to go back and explore more of the passages and the Park itself.

Our ranger/guide Jim was awesome. He was very knowledgeable, had a lot of interesting information and was also funny. He was even extremely patient with the disrespectful people on our tour who kept taking flash photography (asking in English AND Chinese, mind you...to the Chinese group), even though he very kindly asked them to refrain no less than 10 times.

Mammoth Cave,"First off I would not recommend the Mammoth Cave Passage tour to anyone with physical disabilities or for small children. The little boy on our tour had to be taken out of cave because he was terrified of the dark. Great for older children and teenagers. If you have trouble walking or have night blindness do not take this tour. It's a 1/4 walk down a ramp (which you have to walk back up), then 88 steps down (and of course 88 steps back out). Going inside the cave you have a 1 mile round trip with some areas of hard packed earth and some with pavers. Hand rails in some areas but not all. There is dim electrical lighting in cave but it takes awhile to get your night vision going. I clung to my husband's hand most of the tour. I would suggest bringing a small flashlight for some areas. The cave is awesome and the Park Rangers, who act as guides are super. Highly recommend seeing this cave for yourself if you have no physical limitations.

Mammoth Cave,"This was our third visit in recent years to Mammoth Cave National Park. There are several different tours, and while some overlap, each is unique and highlights a different area of the cave. Mammoth Cave is so large that many sections are still unexplored, and new sections continue to be mapped each year. This year we did the Historic Tour and the Grand Avenue tour, on different days. The Historic Tour has changed a little since the first time we took it - the impressive rotunda and some of the historic information about the cave entrance area are now skipped, since there's a self-guided tour option that covers these topics (if you go on the Historic Tour, you may wish to do the self-guided tour also, for a more complete experience). It's still an excellent cave tour, and a relatively easy walk. There are a few tight/narrow spaces along the way, such as Fat Man's Misery, as well as high steel staircases with see-through mesh floors near the end, where you ascend back to the first level. The Grand Avenue tour is fast-paced and considerably more strenuous. We're middle-aged and made it through with flying colors, but we certainly felt the soreness in our legs the next day, and even some of the 20-somethings on our tour were winded during rest stops. That said, it's a wonderful tour, and you'll see many different parts of the cave. The majesty and size of this place is mind-boggling. We've experienced several different tours over the years, and have never been disappointed. We recommend purchasing tickets online ahead of time, as the tours sell out quickly. Also, be sure to pace yourself over two or three days. You won't be able to see and do everything on a single visit. Regardless of your age or physical ability, you are sure to find one or more tours that suit you. The rangers are helpful and can answer any questions or concerns you may have. Different rangers may present different information on tours, so even if you take the same tour on a subsequent visit, you may see new things or learn new information. The only drawback is that the quality of your tour will depend somewhat on the people in your tour group. Most of our fellow tour mates, children and adults alike, were considerate and respectful, but on any tour you are liable to run across a few noisy, obnoxious people of any age. The rangers can't police everyone, so your best bet is to move to the front of the group and/or away from the offending parties, if you can. Also, remember that the national park offers additional activities above ground, so there's more than just cave tours. Finally, don't miss Spelunker's ice cream parlor...the ice cream is locally made and delicious, and it's the perfect treat after a long day of cave tours or other outdoor activities!","April 30, 2018","Very impressive, and so much to do and see",10,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"Conditions within the cave are very consistent year-round. There is only one day that Mammoth Cave is closed and that is Christmas. As much as they are open you need to order your tickets in advance especially for weekends. Very easy to do on a national parks site. We did two tours on Saturday. The domes at 10 a.m. The historic tour at 3:30. We are in relatively good health. But if you are not you're not used to walking up stairs this may be a challenge. Also I would suggest to parents they may really want to think about bringing kids under the age of six. 2 hours is a lot of time for kids to be moving. Most of the groups are about a hundred people. We had some several small children in both tours that when the ranger was talking the little kids didn't keep quiet. Once you start those tours, you're going to have to finish it. Take that into consideration. I thought the historic tour was very interesting. There are times that you are going to have to really duck to make avoid getting whacked in the head with stone. Make sure you wear appropriate shoes. There was a bathroom on the historic tour towards the end of the tour. You will not be able to use it until you get to that part of the tour. On the domes tour there is no bathroom. Take that into consideration. Also it can be a little wonky in some of the areas of Tours. We are so glad we did it. Park staff was pretty nice. Lots of gift shops. Most tours are already sold out the day of. Friends of ours tried to get their tickets Friday night on April 27th. 10 minutes before office close the park Personnel would not allow them to buy tickets and told them to come back. That would be my criticism. Each tour showed a different part of the cave. That was pretty interesting. Ethan the Ranger did a fantastic job on the historical and the domes tour.","April 30, 2018",One of 23 UNESCO Sites in the US,113,"Miamisburg, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"We loved our Historic Tour. The rangers did a great job keeping us informed and entertained. The views are astounding.The part which annoyed us mildly on the trip were the adults with their kids who continued to mumble to each other while the ranger was giving us safety or historical information, so we let others pass to get away from them. If you have to explain or repeat things to your kids, please let the rangers explain first, then discuss, as there are multiple times and open areas where you walk for a while without the rangers speaking.Most annoying was when we were next to a very loud boy whose parents thought everything he said was hilarious, and allowed him to touch the ancient rocks (and participated) even though the rangers asked us all to respect and preserve. The tour accepts 100 with only a ranger in front and back, so it is impossible for the rangers to repeat requests for respect if you are in the middle of the group. There are a few tight passages where you can't help but touch rocks which are obviously smooth. Other than that, please tell your kids to respect, and not contribute to touching as the boy's parents did.They mention before the tour that there are a couple of challenging pathways. I, as well as all in our group, (of all ages,shapes and sizes) seemed to have no trouble with the narrow or low, short passages. However, there is a section of steep steps downward in a narrow area where I was slightly nervous, but took it slow. If you have any reservations about the terrain at all, make sure to be at the very beginning or very end of the group to be near a ranger.Overall, the trip was excitedly impressive, and we look forward to returning to do additional tours with exceptional rangers.","April 30, 2018","Fun, Educational, but Parents Should Set a Good Example",82,Ohio,5
Mammoth Cave,"This is one large, beautiful and busy place. Make sure you pre-book tickets way in advance of your visit to the cave tours you want to take part in. We did the senior friendly tours which required very little stair climbing - entrance to mammoth cave and frozen Niagara - both very different experiences and worth the time. If you are claustrophobic you may want to skip the frozen Niagara - my father suffered through but was glad he did. If you have any issues with insects you may not want to go at all - lots of cave crickets hanging above your head at close proximity. No bats though that we saw.

We also took the Domes and Dripstones Cave tour, which was also amazing. The two were completely different tours. Loved them equally. So much history-great learning experience. Be prepared for short episodes of moderate strenuous activity on both tours, per my opinion. We also took a mile long trail walk, visited the gift shops, and stopped at the cafe for a light nibble.

Mammoth Cave,"We did the Historic Entrance tour during our visit to Mammoth Cave. It was excellent. The tour was true to it's advertising, so read the online material to note the duration, route, stairs to climb, etc. before you book it.We booked the tour online, and then picked up the actual tickets from the Visitor's Center. Tour groups queue up at brick gazebo structures (they tell you which one) outside the Visitor Center about 10 minutes before go time. The lead ranger for your group will give a short orientation, and also some important warnings about health expectations (like don't come if you have health or nerve issues), and then off you go. I'd guess that there were about 70 folks (mix of all ages) in our group, and a second ranger acts as the caboose ensuring no one gets left behind.The lead ranger stops and gives informative talks about 5 times during the tour. There is no amplification, so you need to bunch together to hear (which was fine).The passageways, big rooms, lighting, and trail conditions were all excellent. It is amazing how well maintained it all is.Most of the stair climbing occurs at the end, and then one must also trek back up a significant hill back to the Visitor Center area. We noticed a number of folks had to stop and catch their breath. Traction was no problem on steps or the paths.There are some very narrow and height-restricted passageways on this route, but unless one is a literal giant. it is all very doable and fun.We were very, very pleased with this tour.

Per the description there are a lot of steps on tour. The beginning of the tour is basically a down ward descent on 280 narrow and wet stairs. If you are out of shape or claustrophobic this is not the tour for you. Don't let the distance of 3/4 a mile fool you. My legs were sore the next day after this adventure.

Very basic stuff but still beautiful and rewarding to be able to walk down that historical entrance. Wish there would have been a bit more in terms of information along the walk. On the way out, my 2 boys and I took a trail to Dixon Cave. This walk was also pretty easy and the boys had fun venturing off the beaten path to climb some small rock formations. Once at Dixon Cave the stairs were a fun aspect and the information on the hibernating Indiana Bats was a neat highlight.

Mammoth Cave,"Just LOVE all of our national parks - true gems in the U.S. We didn't have an opportunity to spend a lot of time here, but loved what we did. Unfortunately, when we arrived on a Friday, ALL of the cave tours were booked, and the next available ones to book were the following Wednesday, and we were leaving that day. So - if you are going, and want to do a cave tour -- BOOK AHEAD if you are able to. We did do the self-guided tour, which at least gave us the opportunity to go in one of the caves. We had our (9-year old) granddaughter with us, and she enjoyed this as well. It's not strenuous at all - the only stairs are going in/out - none in the cave itself. There are employees inside to answer any questions. Cave tours are not the only experience here - there are LOTS of well-marked trails to hike as well. All of the park employees were very helpful. There is no fee to get in the park itself, so if you can't take a cave tour, at least go in and check out whatever you have time for. You won't be disappointed.","April 11, 2018",Another awesome national park!,102,Wadsworth,5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave is a national treasure. It's the longest cave in the world and offers several different levels of cave tours. We took the Domes and Dripstones tour. You descend 300 steps through narrow passages to the beginning of the tour. Then there are more stairs and inclines so it isn't for the faint of heart, but it's worth every step. Once the tour starts you see one wonder after another. Our tour guide was funny, informative and exceptional. The gift shops were very up-to-date and fun. We thoroughly enjoyed Mammoth!","April 10, 2018",A National Treasure,18,"Springfield, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"We were in 6 people traveling back home and decided to stop to see the cave. As we have no much time to spend we did the self-guided tour. It opens at 9:30am and costs 5 bucks per head. It took about 40min to walk around and take some pictures (no flashes). There were some rangers inside the cave explaining things about the cave and its history. If you have time, they have guided tours, but I recommend to buy tickets online before going...","April 9, 2018",Longest cave system in the world,11,"Davison, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"The nice thing about this park is all of the ""extras"" that you can find in the area. The cave itself is somewhat anticlimactic compared to others in this region. The park center is one of the nicest that I have seen. Again, there are so many different things to do in this area that it is worth planning an extra day just to look around! Book your cave tour (a couple of hours) and then spend the rest of your time seeing the sites! ","April 9, 2018",It's not Carlsbad!,7,"Hagerstown, Maryland",4
Mammoth Cave,"We tried to see it in two days and our feet paid the price. We hike the top and did two cave tours.

Mammoth Cave,"We stopped in for another tour during spring break on our way to Florida. We have been here before and did the Historic tour so we did the domes and drip stones tour this time. I booked our tour the night before. The day we arrived all tours were sold out. I am glad we did this as we would have made a 2 hour detour for nothing.The tour included a bus ride. We loaded on the buses and arrived at the entrance we would be taking. We listened to a short speech about what you can and cannot do. We were told to keep up with the person in front of us. We waited and put ourselves near the back of the tour group. The beginning of the tour was very interesting while we were descending into the cave. It was a very pretty and a wet environment. BUT, in order to keep up with the person in front of you there was no time for pictures or really time to look around. It felt like we were being rushed through the cave. We then stopped in a large room and heard some information and had other visitors ask questions, which if they would have looked in the museum they would known the answers to their questions.Then we walked, again feeling like it was a rush through the cave. We came to another stop where the same people asked basic questions. Then we began the last leg of the journey where you had an option to take an extra 50 steps down to really see the frozen Niagara. I'm glad that we went down it was neat but again it felt rushed. The tour was neat but I wish they would either extend the amount of time you are on the tour or stop the ranger talking sessions. We spent $65 on our family tour which isn't terrible. I just wish we had more time to look and enjoy the tour.","April 8, 2018","Good, but with issues Domes and Drip stones tour",167,Wisconsin,3
Mammoth Cave,"Took the domes and dripstones tour. The initial descent was a bit claustrophobic and one girl in front of us became literally hysterical when she saw a cave cricket. The descent was almost the coolest part of the tour as you squeeze through passages and climb down stairs. Most of the cave system however, is featureless. They tell you about how the caves were formed and the entrances created but until the final room (frozen niagra) there are NO formations. The frozen niagara room is impressive but you climb down 50 steps and then have a few seconds to take a picture and you have to climb right back up again as the landing is very small. Disappointing. We had tickets for the historical tour but after listening to the description of ""Fat Mans Misery"" we chose not to go, as we are not huge but didn't feel the need to squeeze through a very narrow low ceiling passage for 100 yards. We did the self guided tour and that was actually very cool. Cave rooms are huge. No formations again, but a few bats and interesting historical signs. We live near a lot of Virginia caves and find we prefer these, due to the number and variety of the formations throughout. Mammoth caves, by comparison, seems somewhat dull, unfortunately.

Mammoth Cave,"We booked a few months in advance to ensure we got the tours we wanted; at a minimum you'll want to book a couple weeks out. Our family of 5 (kids are 18, 16, 12) thoroughly enjoyed both tours - we did the Historic Tour and the Grand Avenue Tour. If we had to do just one, we would pick Grand Avenue, but are glad we did both.If you're used to visiting national parks at your own pace, you may be a bit disappointed. Given the way they stagger tours through the caves, the tours keep a very precise timeline - and with 75-100 people on each tour, you'll find yourself surrounded by other visitors who are either jockeying for position in line or holding up the line to take pictures. But that's a very minor complaint - overall, the tours move well, and you see a lot.The caves are absolutely incredible - well worth the time to visit and learn. Grand Avenue moves at a very brisk pace - at times we were surprised how quickly we were moving through the cave. We're all fit and never felt like it was too much - but there were some folks (especially seniors & young kids) who were struggling at times to keep up. You cover 4 full miles in 4 hours - the tour does have a few built-in rest stops (including bathroom breaks) that makes it more manageable.Would recommend bringing water bottles (there are refilling stations in the visitor center) to stay hydrated on the hike. There are two options for food in the park - the Green River Grill (sit-down service w/a decent menu of pub/cafe fare) and the Spelunker's Cafe (counter service / fast-food, ice cream). We ate at the Front Porch Diner in Cave City; other than that, your only nearby options are fast-food in Cave City.","April 8, 2018","Book ahead, well worth it!",28,"San Ramon, CA",5

Mammoth Cave,Our family visited the park over spring break. It was a busy time at the park and it was difficult to get tour reservations a week in advance. Luckily we were able to get last minute reservations for the Historic tour. This was a moderate two hour tour. We enjoyed the history and stories of the cave I would not recommend this tour for very young children or those with mobility issues. The spaces are restricted at points and could be difficult carrying young children. The size of the caves are amazing.

Mammoth Cave,"Our group of 6 (age 6-69) thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Call ahead of you want a guided tour. We went on a Thursday and luckily got in on a guided tour last minute. No others were available for 3 days. We did the self-guided Discovery Tour that went through the main rotunda. Although self-guided, there were several rangers available for questions. The tour was easy physically and suitable for those with confined space issues. We also did the guided Dripstone Tour. The rangers did an excellent job - very informative and safety-conscious. The tour is 2 hours long and moderately strenuous. Some people abandoned the tour very quickly as there are many very tight spaces and crevices. The tour was too tight for those with back-infant carriers. A few managed with front-infant carriers. The frozen Niagara towards the end of the tour was stunning!If you are a fan of National Parks, consider stopping at the bookstore and buying a National Parks Passport. A cool thing for kids - get an official stamp at every National Park you visit. ","April 7, 2018",Excellent Family Activity!!,10,"Wabash, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"My teenage son and I did the Wild Cave tour - super fun and a highlight of the trip! Our guides, Chris and Mary did a great job keeping everyone safe but also letting it be a real adventure. Just make sure you book early, read the requirements for dress (hiking boots over the ankles and light clothes to wear under the coveralls they provide), are in decently good shape, are under 42"" around (or you won't make it through the tight passages), don't mind dirt, heights, or confined spaces, and remember to bring a water bottle and some lunch! We also took the whole family on the Domes and Dripstone Tour, which we also enjoyed. If you have less time and/or don't want to worry about the extra requirements of the Wild Cave, this was a fun way to learn some history and see some beautiful parts of the cave. My husband and younger son also did the Historic Tour and said it was also great. Be sure to check which parts of the cave the various tours cover, so that you can see different parts on multiple tours. We went during Spring Break and there were not any longer tours left for those who just showed up, so decide a few months in advance and book what you want! We also did some above-ground hiking in the park and that was beautiful and worth while as well.","April 7, 2018",Beautiful cave with fun options for tours,7,Midland,5

Also, the above ground hiking is really good too. My family and I were able to walk down to Echo River, where the underground river bubbles up as springs on the surface.

Little did we know that when they say they recommend reservations that you actually must have reservations or you do not get to see the caves. We rearranged our trip and had to leave a day early so that we could get tickets for a cave tour. We did the domes and dripstones tour. It was beautiful but the tour size was 114 people plus 2 guides. There was not any time for questions and most of the information was lost due to not being able to hear the guide at all. They hurried us in and out and did not want us to take many pictures. Glad we visited but next time we will make reservations online well in advance.

Mammoth Cave,"We took the Historic Tour of the cave and it was moderately strenuous. I say that mostly because of the large amount of steps at the end of the tour to exit the cave. Our guide was excellent and so very informative. Some of his stories were of huge interest to even the little kids. If you are expecting beautiful formations and columns, this is not the tour for you. The cave is well lit and paved and easy to navigate. There were adequate railings and walkways. When he stopped and turned out the lights to give everyone an idea of the silence and the degree of darkness in the early days, it was truly amazing! The kids enjoyed the old cave graffiti. We did see one bat, and some cave crickets but the cave is relatively just that - a huge hole in the ground filled with stories and adventure. The kids did the Junior Ranger program here too, and really enjoyed it.","April 2, 2018",Beautiful and informative!,52,"Fairview, Tennessee",5
Mammoth Cave,Spectacular views and trails both under or on top of ground. We took 2 eight-year old kids and was a little disappointed when we could not get one of the guided tours of the cave (Book ahead! Especially on the weekend!). We had to take the self-guided Disocvery tour which turned out to be great for their short attention span. Guides were in the cave to answer questions. It had enough impressive views to entertain the kids. It allows you to tour the Historic Entrance in one of the biggest areas of the cave. Above ground trails were perfect too which were located all around the cave tour entrance. We had a great lunch at the grill; superb ice cream (at the Parlor which has food too) and even satisfied my retail therapy need at the gift shop (Authentic handmade jewelry from Native American Indians). Would love to stay the night sometime.

Mammoth Cave,We went on two cave tours during our visit. The historic tour shows you just how “mammoth” Mammoth Cave is...we also did the domes and dripstones tours. Many of the caves at Mammoth Cave are dry caves meaning you won’t see many stalactites or stalagmites but there are some one the domes and dripstone tours. We also did some “above ground” hiking before our tours. Overall a good experience but the tours a quite large so it is difficult ask many questions of the guide/rangers.

I could've listened to her all day. A few thoughts: order your tickets in advance online, because tours sell out. The caves aren't cold, a sweatshirt was fine for us.

Our guide was very informative, and knowledgeable. She gave speeches and took questions. Some of the passages were very narrow and some of the ceilings were very low. I have back problems but was okay on this trip. Halfway through there was a location to sit and relax for about ten minutes. None of my kids had any problems keeping up. My son (5 years old) had a blast and wanted to do more. They have longer tours which I will be wanting to check out. Some of the facilities, such as the cafe, seem a bit dated, but the prices are lower than you would expect, and it's clean.  This place is only an hour and a half drive from Louisville, and makes a great day trip.

Mammoth Cave,"I was able to get in on the afternoon Domes & Dripstones Tour. We rode a bus out to the entrance, just a few miles. This is a guided tour. First we descended approximately 260+ steep steps into the caves. Looking over the rails was like looking into a bottomless pit. It was awesome! We met others in the caves too. There were a part of a volunteer group picking up litter and things left behind from other tours. They were working only by the light of their helmets. Our trail had lights that were turned on as we entered different sections. We saw different formations including stalactites and stalagmites. Just before our ascent to the top, we saw the Frozen Niagara. It was beautiful! The ascent to the top was nothing like the descent. There were a few stairs here & there and some inclines going out. I'm a 53 year old female, over weight and out of shape, but I didn't have a problem. Then, we loaded up on a bus and headed back to the visitor's center. The Visitor's Center is nice. It has a small gift shop and information everywhere. Across the way is the hotel and restaurant. Walking around the area, you can view the walk down to the Historic Tour entrance.

Mammoth Cave,"Overall, you get what they describe. This is a dry cave that is mostly limestone with some gypsum. It's not much to see for children or for people that aren't at least slightly interested in geology. If you are not, then this will just be the same thing for about 3.5 of the four hours. At the end you see interesting formations and some stalactites/stalagmites. Don't expect more than they are offering- but what they are offering is great!Although you get what they describe in the tour description, I felt like things could have been better. Our tour guide was not extremely personable- she was fine, but not overly chatty and didn't seem like she was willing to answer tons of questions like I would have expected. The guides don't actually give that much information on this tour. Maybe if people ask questions, then you get more information, but my tour did not. The tour guide mentioned things that I feel were like ""stock phrases"" that she didn't know much more about- but, of course, I don't know that for sure. This was extremely fast paced. I am 21 and in average shape and I could definitely keep up with the pace (although a few times I was winded) but that really wasn't the issue; I wanted more time to just take in the cave and look at the rocks. I glanced at a few fossils but you cannot stop to look as you will slow the rest of the tour down and they won't allow you to linger at all. I understand keeping the group moving, but the reason that you are in the cave is to look and even use it as an educational experience. I felt like the price was fair because you are in the cave for a LONG TIME. That being said, wear comfortable walking shoes (boots if you have them) that have tread and solid soles. The floors are rocky and uneven, so you feel each bump if your soles are soft. I wore a vest and long sleeves and was very happy with my choice. It is constantly 54F in the cave and, when you are hiking, you warm up quickly. They say no snacks, but people bring them anyway. However, you hold railings in the cave and, since there are bats, I wouldn't want to eat finger foods after touching a railing that potentially had bat droppings on it. The buildings include gift stores and informative posts and they are very well upkept; it may be one of the nicest national parks I have been to. The hotel seemed nice too, although we didn't stay there and were not happy with the restaurant's quality.","March 22, 2018",Grand Avenue Tour,11,,4

Not complaining about kids but there are some things that young children should not be allowed to do until they are older. Maneuvering can get difficult when you have to keep a very close eye on them and yourself. Recommend at least 8 years old. Do your research before you come.

Mammoth Cave,"The park is huge. The caves are extensive, with over 400 (yes, 400!) miles mapped so far. To make it all reasonable, they provide 10 options for you to choose from to explores nature's wonders. We took the 2-hour ""Domes and Dripstones Tour"". You enter through a sink hole, almost straight down via a spiraling 280 step stairway. The up part is a little more gradual. There is one tour labeled Accessible (wheelchairs are usable). There are some tours that are real ""spelunking"" in nature, where you do some real climbing and crawling! The prices are rather reasonable, particularly in comparison to typical tourist sites.

Very affordable and the tour is simply amazing. Eric was our guide and he was perfect. So much history is packed into that cave and he passed all of the information onto us. Be advised this tour is not for those with fear of the dark or tight places. The path is lit but the walk can get very tight at times. At no point are you crawling, you stand/duck the whole time. There are 500 some stairs I believe on this tour but after the descent down it’s a cake walk. Towards the end of the tour there is an option to go down 50 more stairs. You will kick yourself if you don’t go down, it is beyond beautiful down there and the stairs aren’t even bad. Amazing trip, definitely would go back and will recommend this to everyone.

There are lots of steps and narrow passage ways on this tour, but also nicely spaced sit down breaks. If your hips and knees can take steps and you are in moderate shape you will be fine on this tour. However if steps are a struggle stay away from this one, because there are about 500. There were 4 of us, ages 6-68, and everyone loved it!! The trails are beautiful, and luckily we were there following a wet, heavy snow, creating crystal, snow covered trees!! It was a winter wonderland before we went into the cave, but it was all gone when we came out 2 hours later. Had so much fun and will definitely be back!! PS.

Mammoth Cave,"Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of our national parks. I suppose I just prefer big mountains so this really wasn't my thing. Having said that, there really was nothing wrong with Mammoth Cave. I did four separate tours through the cave ... each was different so the best thing I can do is give my opinion of the cave and tours.1. Historic Tour - by far the most interesting and probably the best ""overall"" cave experience. If you only do one tour, this is probably the one.2. Gothic Avenue - ugh! But this is a matter of opinion. The big thing about this tour is the ""history"" of 19th century tours through the cave and the many names burnt into the ceiling of the cave. On one hand, some people might appreciate the ""history"" here. For me, this was just graffiti defacing the cave and a great example of what people would do to ruin our national parks in the name of money. As I said, just my opinion.3. Domes and Dripstones - in my opinion, falsely named as basically there are very few of either. Far and away, the best part of this tour is the very end at the Frozen Niagra section. Might as well just take the Frozen Niagra tour and save some time. This tour also starts with a seriously narrow 250 step set of stairs down. You would think that going down would be easy, but this staircase murdered my knees. Know your limits. 4. Cleaveland Avenue - this was actually quite interesting, but a lot of the same thing. Still, this was pleasant and the elevator ride OUT of the cave is a blessing.Don't expect a lot of formations (stalagtites and stalagmites). This is a DRY cave .... think subway tunnel without the tracks (except for Frozen Niagra which was quite beautiful)On the other hand, the guides for all four tours were quite knowledgeable and very entertaining. Absolutely no complaints. A note on photography .... no tripods allowed and VERY dim lighting. Don't expect great pictures. Even with a very high ISO ... pictures are pretty poor. Even with a 3200 ISO, my Canon usually needed near a 1 second exposure ... impossible without a tripod. Cleaveland Avenue had the best lighting, but don't expect to get the pics you see on the website. Above ground .... still winter (March) so no leaves on the trees. The park would probably be much prettier in the summer. Still, the trails are nice and in many ways, I enjoyed ""above ground"" more than the cave. The campground looked nice (I'm not a camper, so really no expertise here) Great bike trail ... overall I couldn't help but think that this was probably a great place to camp even if you never went into the cave. To each his own ... and that goes for the national parks.","March 14, 2018",Not bad ... just not really my thing!,79,"Hattiesburg, Mississippi",4
Mammoth Cave,"This cave is insane! I can't believe the size of it! Before heading to the park, I was a little overwhelmed with which tour to choose. We ended up picking a couple, and I was happy with both. The first tour we did was the Historic tour. This tour was great! It gave us a good overview of the cave, and we learned a lot of the history on how how humans have used this cave for hundreds and hundreds of years. The tour includes popular spots such as the historic entrance, fat man's misery, tall man's agony, the bottomless pit, Giant's coffin, mammoth dome, etc. Although the tour group was large, it thinned out quickly, and made for a nice pace to explore everything in the cave. When the rangers had stuff to say, we all collected in large rooms, so no one missed any of the history. A definite thumbs up from me!The second tour we did was the Domes and Dripstones tour. This tour requires a short 10 minute bus ride to the new entrance. This tour was also great. The highlight was obviously Frozen Niagara. It was stunning! Much like the previous tour, when the rangers wanted to explain something, or take questions, the entire group would collect in large areas, so everyone could hear what needed to be said. The visitors centre was awesome. Remember that mammoth cave is in the central time zone! Lexington and Louisville are in eastern time (if you're coming from either of those cities). We messed up with our timing, so we ended up being extremely early for our tour. Fortunately there's a lot to keep you busy at the visitor's centre/ hotel. In total, there were 4 stores, a cafe, a restaurant, a museum/ interpretative centre and numerous outside trails. Make sure to allow for a little time here (especially if you're better with time changes, compared to us. lol). Overall, it was a great national park, and I highly recommend it. Make sure to reserve your cave tours early! We booked a few weeks in advance, but on the day, we noticed a lot were sold out. ","March 14, 2018",Had a blast!,48,"Brantford, Canada",5

Mammoth Cave,We enjoyed our visit to Mammoth Cave NP very much. We participated in two tours - Domes & Dripstones and the Gothic Avenue Tour.

My best advice though ( since we did not know this) get there early to get tickets for the tour and time you want....so much was sold out when we arrived so we did nit get the tour we really wanted to do.

Mammoth Cave,"The Mammoth Caves are awesome to see, there is no doubt about it. I just really wished we took a different tour. We did the Frozen Niagara because it was mine and my husband’s first cave experience. Well the tour is like 80% listing to a ranger ramble on about stuff none of us understood and/or cared about. They say this tour is the easiest one but they don’t say you still have to duck your head in many spots and the floors are pretty hard to walk on. There was another tour coming out when we were going in, and instead of waiting like 2-3 minutes, they made us all squeeze by each other! Talk about claustrophobia and just plain dangerous!Also, I kept reading reviews on how cold it is down there, so I brought a jacket, and I was burning up! Also, unless you enjoy hearing kids scream and cry and whine for over an hour, this tour is probably not the best for you.Oh and I can’t forget the worst part. At the very end, the ranger talks about the wildlife in the cave. I really, really wished he would have left that part out. There are these nasty cave crickets that look like deadly spiders that are EVERYWHERE. So he shines a light above your head so you can see how close you are to them and then you have to walk out of the cave thinking about all those creepy crawlers falling on you. Not really necessary in my opinion.","March 10, 2018",Frozen Niagara tour sucked,51,"Fowlerville, Michigan",3

Mammoth Cave,"I have toured caves in various parts of the world and usually enjoyed them thoroughly, so I was really looking forward to finally visiting Mammoth Cave National Park. But I have to admit to being disappointed. It is the longest cave system in the world, which does make it unique and impressive from a size perspective; but at least on the tour I was on (Domes and Dripstones) there is actually not a lot to see. You spend the bulk of the 2 hour tour going down and up stairs with almost no stopping (being hustled along by the guide because they're ""on a schedule""); and there's really no reason to stop anyways since it's just rock walls around you most of the way - not a lot of the unique geological formations that make caves interesting. At two spots along the way they have benches set up where you sit to have the guide talk to you - but those two spots really have nothing to make them interesting. The only really interesting cave formations are in the very final section of the tour and even there it's much less than I've seen in many other caves; and it turns out you can see that whole last section on the Frozen Niagara Tour while eliminating almost all of the stairs. So if you're really into climbing up and down staircases through very narrow wet rock passages, then you might want to try this tour; otherwise I'd recommend sticking to the Frozen Niagara Tour - save time, money and effort and see just as much. Or if you REALLY want to see an interesting cave, go to Nevada instead and see the Lehman Caves in Great Basin National Park.","March 3, 2018",Disappointing cave tour,17,"Fremont, California",2
Mammoth Cave,"This was not a part of our itinerary whilst passing through Kentucky, but it was sure worth it. As we were going by, we thought we’d check it out. When we got inside, we had just missed a tour, so we decided to do the short one that was available to do on your own. It was an especially hot day, so with the sweat on your skin, entering the cave was FREEZING. At 55* temp year round, it was welcoming, but you had to get use to the temp change.

The cave system is very large and each one is different with unusual sites to see. So more than one option would make the trip more informative. Great gift shop and contrary to popular website listings we got to get tickets to the cave the same day we were there. SO check before you rule it out for not having purchased online in advance.

I finally planned it into a road trip last summer. My 5 kids and I (ages 8-16) stayed in Cave City and did the Historic Tour. I think it was just right. Not too hard but still got to see a generous amount of cave features. The descriptions warning of having to stoop for Tall Man's Misery really had me apprehensive, but it really was no big deal. I would definitely recommend visiting if you enjoy natural wonders.","February 27, 2018",Finally got to see Mammoth Cave!,21,,4

Mammoth Cave,"Everyone should go here sometime during their life. We went in winter to avoid the crowds and only 4 tours were available (we took them all)- that is a shame and the rangers admit the cost of offering the 4 hour tour or the wild cave tour in winter just isn't cost effective. Get reservations though- a few of our tours were still sold out. Our ranger guides were terrific and we got to spend hours in magnificent astounding formations. Ask as many questions as you want- the tour only gets better. Hikes marked and available above ground when not underneath- from 30 minutes to several hours. Love the Green River Ferry- free and open 6am - 9:30pm. Get you into the back country. Cave tours do require some fitness- the caves are left as natural as possible so they are cold, dark and rocky. Some small places, tight places, high places, very little moisture.","February 23, 2018",Bucket list destination,74,,5

Stay close to the front, because you won't here the ranger otherwise. Also, pay attention to tour schedules and get a reservation as soon as possible.

Mammoth Cave,"We did the Mammoth Passage tour, and it was, well, a bit underwhelming. The tour group was large, so it was not interactive. It was just a guide talking, frequently asking rhetorical questions and then quickly answering them herself. It felt a bit odd. The cave is cool - obviously huge with super high ceilings. We were disappointed at the lack of stalagmites and stalactites, but if we had studied about the cave at all before we went in we would have known not to expect those. :) (Our bad.) The park itself is cool - lots of green areas to explore on a sunny day. We saw a deer by the little cabins that you can rent. Gift shop is cute. Overall, it was a cave. Luray Caverns in Virginia were much more interesting to walk through. But hey, if you are in Kentucky and not Virginia, by all means go to Mammoth Cave!

Both tours cancelled, wound up on the Niagara tour, which is a nice taste.Re-set for one big tour the next day, but that got cancelled later in the day, too.Plus: Park staff were friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, and doing the best they could to re-schedule and re-arrange for the 40-odd folks who all rolled in at their 11am opening. The internet booking system worked, and refunded my money when the tours were cancelled, without me doing anything. The visitors center has an excellent museum well worth an hour before you go into the cave. The cave itself seems very interesting and I'd like to go back & try again.Minus: well, not much you can do when it snows half a foot on top of a layer of ice.

That being said, it was neat to see the the immensity of the cave system, along with the interesting history presented by the ranger. An hour probably does not do justice to this park, so we would come back at a warmer time, although better weather means bigger crowds and tough reservations.

Mammoth Cave,"We visited here with my grown son and wife. It was our first visit to the caves. I booked the historical tour in advance since I read they sell out. This was the case on our visit. We arrived about noon for our 1:00 tour and nothing was available for those without a reservation. I have some claustrophobia so I was a bit on edge since I did not know what to expect. On this tour, the guide takes about 75-100 people into the case through a large stairwell part way down the hill from the visitor center. The cave is huge inside so there was not issue with feeling closed in. It is lit fairly well so footing is not an issue and you don’t have to talk on loose stones. The guide took us through the cave and told us the historical discoveries made in its past. That coupled with the beauty of the cave made it very interesting and impressive. There are some stairs to climb up so if this is an issue, you should not take this tour. After we finished with visited the exhibits in the main building and walked about the grounds. My son wished we had booked additional tours to see other parts of the cave. We all liked the experience and will return in the future.

What was disappointing was our guide, who pointed out that he did not usually conduct this tour, so I allowed some leeway in that regard.

Mammoth Cave,"We have been to several caves (Carlsbad Caverns, Jewel Cave, Bridal Cave, and a few others). Mammoth Cave is the largest cave system in the world, so what it does not offer in the way of stalactites, stalagmites, and other visually captivating details, it makes up for with its sheer size. The rangers did a great job of telling the story of how the caves were formed (and are still being formed). We took two of the longer tours, the ""Historic"" Tour in the morning and the ""Domes and Dripstones"" tour in the afternoon. It made for an active and memorable day for our family. Domes and Dripstones took us in through a sink hole with a narrow, twisting descent, and eventually through the ""Frozen Niagara"" which is the one spot that has the formations you are used to in other caves. These two tours are only for folks who are healthy. There are some demanding spots where you have to walk hunched over, and the tour moves at a brisk pace so that they can get large groups through all day long. My only criticism is that we had to move faster than I would have liked in some spots, but I understand because it is the largest cave system in the world and a HUGE tourist attraction.

Yes, stalactites are cool and other caves are full of them. So, enjoy those too. However, Mammoth is completely awesome for other reasons, and you should experience those. It sheer size is incredible -- you feel like you are entering into another world that goes on foreover. The geologic, mining, human and science experiment histories are all very interesting, and the variety of physical space --- from huge open rooms to tight tubes and stair cases -- make the trek (we took the Historic Tour) an adventure with a perfect level of physical activity for the reaonably fit. We were very lucky in booking a tour: we went a couple days after Christmas on a very cold day, and were able to get on the Historic Tour leaving in <2 hours. We used that time to visit the mini-museum and grab some lunch. And, compared to summertime reviewers, we had found the cave wam (my daughter pointedly took off her winter coat!). Yes, do Wind Cave and Caverns of the Ozarks, etc., for other cave features (afterall, it's not an either-or situation!) but definitely do Mammoth to see parts of a massive underworld labyrinth that is still under exploration.

It was spectacular to see what was there but I came away wishing I had known to book something in advance as it would have been fun to explore more of the cave system. Nevertheless, it was a wonderful opportunity to see a UNESCO World Heritage site.","December 13, 2017",The worlds largest cave system,45,"Calgary, Canada",5

Mammoth Cave,There is SO much to do at this park! Make sure to give yourself 2 or 3 days here. The park offers several different Cave tours so it will take days to do them all. Also there are many miles of hiking trails above ground and ranger activities you can go to. It is so peaceful here and lots of wildlife.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave National Park is the home to Mammoth Cave, which is the world's largest known cave system. Mammoth Cave contains over 400 miles of explored chambers and passageways. An early guide, Stephen Bishop, described the cave as a ""grand, gloomy and peculiar place.""The parking lot at Mammoth Cave National Park was quite busy the day after Thanksgiving. We were glad we had pre-purchased our tickets for a cave tour as the next available reservation wasn't for another two days. I had read that advanced reservations were strongly recommended as the spots filled up quickly.The Historic Cave Tour started right on time. We had pre-selected the Historic Cave Tour with a two hour duration that was 2 miles long. The tour contained 440 steps, 155 of which were at Mammoth Dome. It was $14 per person (but, toddlers were still free, YIPPEE!!). I carried our toddler in a carrier to ensure he stayed safe and nearby. Our toddler was far from interested in staying in the carrier. He wanted to run on his own two legs and find trouble. He was fine while we were moving but became restless when the park ranger guide, Chris, stopped to share fascinating information with us.The other park ranger, also named Chris, was a saint at keeping our toddler entertained when it was time to stop. He took off his hat, put a flashlight underneath it, and then put the light on every time our toddler patted the top of the hat. Our  toddler thought it was hysterical. We were very blessed Park Ranger Chris had such a kind heart and was great little kids. We very much appreciate everything Chris did for our family that day to help make the tour enjoyable for all.It was really incredible to walk through 2 miles of a cave. The 2 mile pathway through the cave was paved and very easy to walk on. Most of the path was at least five feet wide. There were some areas that were very narrow. One section was called ""Fat Man's Misery"" because of how narrow it was. My toddler and I were able to get through connected to each other with no problem but we definitely rubbed against the walls of the cave in some parts. We had to duck through other parts because the ceiling was too low to stand. While we were deep in the cave, they turned the interior lights off. It was blacker than any other blackness. Your eyes will never adjust to the blackness inside a cave. It'll always be pitch black.It was an incredible experience and highly recommend to all. Hopefully we will be able to bring our son back when he is old enough to walk through it himself.","December 4, 2017",Huge! Massive!

Mammoth Cave,"We thoroughly enjoyed taking the ""domes and dripstones"" 90-minute tour here. The tour starts from the visitor center, with a 10-min bus ride from there to the cave entrance. The cave tour itself was moderately strenuous (stairs, narrow spaces) and we were inside the cave for probably less than an hour. The cave system is not too far underground but does extend for over 400 miles!! A guided tour is a nice way to see some of it. The tours do get fully booked so make your reservations in advance.","November 30, 2017",Must do,16,"Barrington, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"Our family took the Domes and Dripstones Tour. Quick bus ride to the opening of the cave and then the tour began with a 280 step staircase. There were a few people on our tour with toddlers who had a hard time walking down the tight staircase. I would not recommend taking small children on this tour. the stairs are very close together, it is damp, and and there are spots that you have to watch not to hit your head. It would be difficult to carry a toddler down those stairs. There is not a bathroom, so make sure your kids go before getting on the bus. The tour was very fascinating. The Frozen Niagara formation was amazing!","November 20, 2017",very cool,40,"Ringgold, Georgia",5
Mammoth Cave,"This park ranger needs to go back for training. He ruined our whole visit and we would never return. He was a condescending retired teacher. He caused my husband to have a panic attack and never wants to go into another cave although we have been in numerous caves without issues. the ranger went overboard in trying to weed out any person with issues. You had to be there to believe it. He criticized people for not being able to keep up when the steps were wet and the area was very dark. this was not us. We were in the front . No stalactites of stalagmites to be seen. We saw two huge rooms with no formations. When we got to some formations at the very end of the tour he would not let us stop or photograph them. When I saw a bacon formation I asked him about it and he sarcastically let me know there was no such thing, just limestone. It cost us a joint $30.00 to have a miserable time. FYI, there were some trails in the park which were nice for us to unwind after that ordeal. We should have taken it up with his supervisor, but you know, we were on our vacation. So sad!","November 20, 2017",Worst tour guide ever,67,"Hot Springs Village, Arkansas",1
Mammoth Cave,"This is an amazing public resource an hour and a half south of Louisville, a perfect place to spend a day on a road trip from there, with the General Patton Museum at Fort Knox, the Kentucky Railway Museum, Hidden River Cave and American Cave Museum, and Diamond Cave all on the way and the National Corvette and the Historic Railpark and Train Museums just a half hour south.Mammoth Cave isn't populated with a lot of stalagmites and stalactites, the dramatic things most associate with caves, but rather the experience is more about the size of the caverns, and it does not fail to impress there.I took three Cave tours in one day in the late fall, starting with a two hour, 10:00 am Domes and Dripstones tour. This tour covers spots in Mammoth Cave that does have the stalactites and stalagmites people expect on cave tours. With a seven minute bus ride from the Visitors' Center to a manmade entrance located in a vegetated sinkhole, the tour starts with a descent of about fifteen minutes / 250 feet / some 200 to 300 steps. You go through a few rooms, see Crystal Lake and end the tour where the stalactites and stalagmites are (Frozen Niagara), down an optional forty-nine steps and back up. While it's optional, this is really the main point of this tour. The bus brings you back to the hotel, which has a quick service cafe, a full service restaurant, and a gift shop open to the public.Next I took the 12:30 Mammoth Passage Tour. I had enough time to buy tickets at the Visitors' Center, go to the restroom and grab a quick bite at the hotel. This tour is a short, visiting three caverns starting at the Historic Entrance to the cave. A number of wooden and tamped earth stairs lead to the place where the tour officially starts, and a number of concrete stairs lead into the mouth of the cave. The tour path is wide with paving stones leading to the first room, the Rotunda, then it proceeds to a room with some historic artifacts. From there, the tour goes onto a well maintained packed earth path into the last room before heading back. In terms of exertion, from the mouth of the cave up to the hotel is probably the most strenuous.I had just enough time to get to the two-hour 2 pm Historic Tour. This was a great counterpart to the Domes and Dripstones tour. The tour starts like Mammoth Passage but takes a different path after the Rotunda, making a loop and ending in the room with historic artifacts of the Mammoth Passage tour before heading back. This tour has many highlights including Giant's Coffin, the bottomless pit, Fat Man's Misery, which is a tight squeeze that some may find claustrophobic, and the impressive Mammoth Dome. Historic context and graffiti from the 1800s are also part of this tour.Things to note: -Mammoth Cave is on Central Time, an hour back from the Eastern Time Zone that Louisville is in. This is important to note when you are booking your tickets, otherwise you may be an hour early. Reserving tickets is almost essential as they sell out.-The caves are pretty much about 55° F year round. Depending on the tour and the amount of exertion it requires as well as the physical shape you are in, a jacket may prove too warm. -All the tours I took were paced at a very leisurely stroll, particularly if you stay in the front of the group.-The pathways I took were all very well maintained. Much of the tour packed earth paths were created after WWI, and have become like cement paths. Other paths were less than a year old, wide with very even paving stones. Stairs in the cave are almost all steel grate, and though they can be steep and narrow, no one in our party (including the elderly and had minor mobility issues) had any real issue navigating them. Heavy set, thin, old and young, no one had issues.-There are parts of the tours where you may be plunged into complete darkness while in the cave, for less than a minute or so-Photography is allowed without flash, but almost everyone found that using a cell phone was far better than using a fancier DSLR type camera. There is dim lighting throughout the cave tours.-Tours are somewhat dependent on the tour guide, in that they are all given particular highlights to mention, but the rest if their spiel is research from the Parks archive to fill out the stories. Hope for a good storyteller, and don't be shy about asking plenty of questions.","November 15, 2017","Awesome Public Resource, Worth Spending A Day",56,"Staten Island, New York",5
Mammoth Cave,"I have longed to visit Mammoth Cave... after reading about it to my students years ago... as the largest caves in the US- I did not know it has the most extensive pathways (412 miles) in the world.Ok... even though they warn you of all sorts of steps and want to make sure people don’t need rescuing... it was not very taxing physically. There were all sorts of people at all different fitness levels. As long as you pay attention where you walk, it isn’t arduous at all. In fact the group size can be as big as 120 people.... so patience is required.My friend and I stayed near the front so we could ask questions and hear answers to others’ questions. Also, the pace up front was steady.We chose 2 *2-hour tours: Historic & Dripstones. The two tours were very different and didn’t overlap in locations. In fact, Dripstones required a bus ride to a different area of the park. We had the same guides on both tours- they were knowledgeable and enthusiastic.Unfortunately, 85% of the bats have died out due to white-nose fungus. They caution you not to wear any clothes from previous caving explorations, and they have you clean your shoes on a wet treated carpet when exiting the caves. Fortunately, because of the decimated bat population... there is not the horrible bat guano odor in the cave. Actually, the caves seem “clean”: they are for the most part dry, few cobwebs, and crickets are the most prevalent “wildlife”.Overall, the experience was wonderful. If I return with my family I would like to check out the spelunking adventures.Enjoy!","November 14, 2017",Cave Adventure ,6,,5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave is worth seeking out -- but the most important thing to know if PLAN AHEAD!! I went online about a week before my visit (right before the solar eclipse of August 2017, which it was very close to) and thought I would casually book our tours. Not much was available. We did get on a great 2-hour walking tour inside the cave (don't remember which one) but would have done more. There are so many options. The place is great. The tour guide was just as you would expect, a straight arrow with some corny jokes. It was not strenuous, though I imagine anyone with a fear of tight spaces should stay away. Take a sweater--even on a hot day--it's cold in there! Some really nice walking trails around the visitor center as well.","November 13, 2017",Love Mammoth Cave,12,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"We really enjoyed the 2 cave tours, Drips & Domes and Historic. We felt like the tour was appropriately paced. Walking towards the front-middle allows you to stop and take pics and take it in a little bit, before moving on.Outside the caves is where the park kind of falls apart. The trails aren't well maintained, or marked. The trails also aren't that interesting. The whole place feels like a tourist attraction, instead of National Park. If the rest of the park was as good as the cave tours, it would be 5-stars.","November 12, 2017","Amazing place, but doesn't ""feel"" like a Ntl Park",18,"Dayton, Ohio",4
Mammoth Cave,"Took the two hour Historic Tour and it was well worth the two hours. The cave is massive with very high ceilings. There were a few areas that were a little low and tight, but mostly wide open spaces. Can’t remember our tour guides name but he was very knowledgeable about the cave and its history, and had lots of interesting tidbits to tell us about.We lucked out when arriving on a Friday and were able to buy 2 tickets for the tour for Saturday morning. The Historic Tour was the only tour available as the rest were sold out. We plan on going back next February but will purchase tickets weeks in advance. Definitely need to purchase tickets ahead of time so you can choose which tour(s) you’d like to do, as there are many.

We did the Historical tour and found it very informative. Our tour guide was knowledgeable and had great enthusiasm which kept the tour engaging the whole time. The tour didn't have the most interesting sights, there are minimal formations, but it was still interesting and gave a great history of the cave. We also did a bit of hiking around the cave, which was very pretty around the river. While all the hiking paths are dog friendly, the caves aren't. The hotel does rent out kennels to anyone visiting by the hour, but there are only 3, so while it wasn't an issue for us in late September, l could see them filling up fast in peak season.","November 10, 2017",Caves on caves on caves,30,,4
Mammoth Cave,"I first went to Mammoth Cave more than 35 years ago. Much has changed in the National Park. The cave has more mapped miles now. There is a spectacular new visitor's center. The whole operation is marvelous. Bu the cave truly is still a national treasure. Each tour is new and enlightening even if you have been on it before. My wife and I went on 3 different tours while we were staying in Cave City. The Domes and Drip Stones is spectacular. There are a lot of stairs. Both of us are in our late 60's, in pretty good shape and we had no difficulty on this tour. It was actually nice to get out and move. The next day we took the Historic Tour. I think it's more difficult than the first one we took. It was just as enjoyable if not more. That afternoon we took the Gothic Tour. All were very enjoyable and got us moving. I didn't hear any complaints on any of our tours or while we were spending time in the visitor's center. The visitor's center is another tour that should not be missed. There are ""negative"" reviews of this national treasure. I'm not sure why. Just from a geologic standpoint the cave is a wonder. Open your mind to possibilities. Expand your horizons. Leave your close mindedness at the door and see the wonder before you. Enjoy the new experience even though it may be different than your expectations. The cave is spectacular in its size, its length, and especially in that which lies yet undiscovered. Sorry about the soapbox. It is spectacular beyond and verbal explanation. You must experience the cave to begin to understand the wonder.","November 9, 2017",Truly a natural wonder!,78,"Anchorage, Alaska",5

Mammoth Cave,"I read a bunch of reviews before going and decided on the grand avenue tour. It is the longest (4 miles/4 hours) and the most strenuous but after reading reviews it seemed like it wouldn't be too difficult. I have asthma that is worsened by exercise and damp air/mold. It is damp in the caves and along the tour we only stopped maybe 5 times and only twice to sit. The rest was a brisk walk. Lots of uphill and downhill action. That would've been worth it if the tour was awesome. But it didn't have anything too Interesting that i would call a ""couldn't miss sight"".

So I carefully reviewed in advance the physical requirements for the historic tour at Mammoth Cave, and fretted quite a lot over the many warnings provided to cave visitors. I was easily the eldest participant in our tour group. But I made it easily and I’m glad I went. I would say that if you are able walk around the block with ease and up a flight of stairs, then you will do fine on this tour. It is indeed somewhat strenuous, especially the flights of stairs at the end of the tour and the steep inclined path back to the parking lot. I wore my step tracker during the tour, and it tells me that I walked 3 miles, 7500 steps, and the equivalent of 19 flights of stairs.","October 29, 2017",Historic Tour- Too strenuous for you?,50,"Pensacola, Florida",4

Mammoth Cave,"We scheduled two tours, the Historic tour and the Domes and Dripstones. Of the two, the Historic was better! Domes and Dripstones was okay, but I felt there was more talking than looking - I might have gone straight to see the Frozen Niagra in a shorter tour, because it felt they stretched that tour and the main point of interest was at the end. This is not a cave with lots of ""pretty"" features, so if you want that, you're better off with a smaller cave elsewhere in the area. But the sheer size and scope, as well as the history, are amazing. And the ""Fat Man's Misery,"" along with Tall Man's Agony, was fun during the Historic tour. However, the whole Cave system is super cool and if it had been warmer we have stayed on the grounds and done even more hiking and a kayak trip.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave is as its name suggests. However, that is its prime feature. If you're expecting stalactites or stalagmites, go to a different cave. Mammoth Cave is not beautiful in that sense - and because it is large, it will get large tours (80 persons!!) which tends to spoil the mood for me. That, and the tour is on a lighted path that has pavers for 90% of the walk. I did the Historic Tour, 2 hours and 2 miles, rated ""moderate"" in difficulty. So all of that is why it gets ""average."" However, being in a cave that in many places is 40-50 ft wide and equally tall, is impressive! Our ranger guide was informative - the wood posts I was seeing, dated back to the War of 1812! The cave environment being very preserving. Note: Book tours in advance by searching ""Mammoth Cave tours"". I made reservations 5 days in advance, but when I walked into the Visitor Center, it was sold out...so don't expect to get your tour of choice on the day you arrive - book in advance.

All of the tour guide tours for the entire day were already sold out. The Welcome Center attendants told us they all sell out online before the day you arrive. So I’d advise anyone going to arrange your tours days in advance. We still enjoyed the self guided tour of the main Cavern. Took about 45 minutes to explore inside and 15 minutes to explore the Welcome Center gift shop area. Parking was almost full by 10:30am so I’d advise getting there when it opens at 9am for better parking. ,"October 17, 2017",Mammoth Cave- Impressive Huge Cavern worth seeing,19,"Roswell, Georgia",5
Mammoth Cave,"At least once a year the family and I travel to Mammoth Cave for a time of fun and relaxation. For the outdoor lover this is a great place to visit. The Cave has quite a history and there is plenty to do in the surrounding area.The National Park Service offers several cave tours to visitors. Several are easy to walk and other can be more challenging. Information on the different Cave tours can be gathered at the visitor’s center. Some notable features of the cave, such as Grand Avenue, Frozen Niagara, and Fat Man's Misery, can be seen on lighted tours ranging from one to six hours in length. Two tours, lit only by visitor-carried paraffin lamps, are popular alternatives to the electric-lit routes. Several ""wild"" tours venture away from the developed parts of the cave into muddy crawls and dusty tunnels.The Echo River Tour, one of the cave's most famous attractions, used to take visitors on a boat ride along an underground river. The tour was discontinued for logistic and environmental reasons in the early 1990s. Mammoth Cave headquarters and visitor's center is located on Mammoth Cave Parkway. The parkway connects with Kentucky Route 70 from the north and Kentucky Route 255 from the south within the park. Bring comfortable walking shoes and plan to do an overnight at the Lodge (new). In the park area you can also zipline, horseback ride, bike, hike and much more.EnjoyDr. Marc, PS 63:7","October 16, 2017",Creating a Lifetime Memory: Mammoth is an understatement.,301,"Franklin, Kentucky",5
Mammoth Cave,"Booked this tour well in advance of our visit (using the park website) hoping this would give a great history and overview of this National Park. We felt we made a good choice although it was not the easiest hike, it did provide a nice variety of cave spaces. The rangers emphasize the number of stairs on this hike - yes there are a LOT - but for us the uphill climbs in the caves were the most trying. I would characterize this as easy to moderate - there is a pace to be maintained to keep up with the rangers as well. There are 3 stops along the way to rest and hear more about the history and geology of the cave. The last part of the hike which takes you through the more conventional stalagmite/stalactite areas was very impressive and made the journey worthwhile.","October 15, 2017",Domes and Dripstones Tour - Great Overview,184,"Lake Jackson, Texas",4
Mammoth Cave,"I traveled to Kentucky because I've always wanted to see mammoth cave. I took the historic tour, it's about 2 hours long. I loved it, but FYI, there are a lot of stairs! There are tight spots, and places you have to duck your head. Listening to people grumble is no fun, so be sure you are up to it. They do offer easier tours.

Mammoth Cave,"I have been on several cave tours in the past and thought I knew what to expect. I was wrong. This is a spectacular representation of what can be seen below the surface. We may have been lucky but I will say that the tour guide , an intern, was excellent. Witty and very knowledgeable, he brought the tour to life. This is not a tour for those who are claustrophobic or afraid of the dark but if you like adventure and quite a bit of challenging walking, you will certainly enjoy this. Lots of children on the tour. Great value and make certain to take your National Park pass to get the discount. I am a senior in reasonable shape and am very glad I took this tour.","October 15, 2017",The Cave experience,6,,5

Mammoth Cave,"Visited in October with kids (17, 16, 10, 9). Reservation / pre-order tickets required, through national park service website. Although 85 deg F outside, the cave was cooler (they said 54 deg F, but shorts and T shirt were adequate, never needed the sweatshirt). I was worried about taking a tour too long and strenuous with the kids, so we decided on Domes and Dripstones (2.5 hours). I also worried about descending 500 stairs. The stairs turned out to be easy to navigate and displayed some of the most beautiful rock formations of the tour, as shown in photo. The stairs were wet in some places, so be careful, but make sure you look all around you to enjoy the caves too. ","October 14, 2017",Domes and Dripstones Tour - Easy and Awesome,9,,5

Mammoth Cave,"We really enjoyed the tour and history. The historic tour is about 2 hours, walking about 2 miles, and it's a big group of people. This is a dry cave, so no stalagmites/tites. But you'll see high cathedral ceilings and deep and caverns. The ranger explains the physical exertion needed. If you can easily walk a mile, climb stairs and walk while bent over you'll be fine. There are approximately 500 steps on the tour. One section is quite narrow, one has low a ceiling and another section you need to step up while bending over.Plan ahead and make reservations.

Mammoth Cave,"This review is strictly directed towards the elderly ranger on the Gothic Avenue tour on Saturday, October 7, 2017. My husband and I drove 5 hours early Saturday morning to make sure we arrived at Mammoth Cave by 8am. We got our tickets and waited in Shelter A for the rangers. Upon walking down the hill, they ushered belongings in the lockers if need be. I had my purse and decided to utilize a locker. We caught back up with the group in time to hear the entire tour prep. At the end of the lecture they asked for tickets, which were in my purse, in the locker. My husband (6'4"") started running up the hill. I told the elderly ranger my husband went to get them and he rudely told me he couldn't wait. We were there for the tour because our 6 year old decided to come to the caves instead of having a birthday party, so he immediately started crying. The ranger rolled his eyes and told me I could come with the kids and to leave my husband. I went to the top of stairs where I saw my husband running back down the hill, so I yelled down the stairs he was coming, only to be locked out already. With 2 crying kids and 2 upset parents trying to console them, we were able to do the discovery tour, which they loved, but I was not refunded my money for what I paid to see the Gothic Tour. The real kicker in all of this, is that the ranger said he couldn't wait 1 (yes, ONE) minute for my husband because they have times to meet, yet we saw our group up at the front way before the 2 hours would have been up. Hince, they could have waited. It wasn't even a wait, we would have been in the back of the line. So to the elderly ranger, I pray for you. May God warm your heart.

Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I went on their 2 most popular tours, the Historic and Domes & Dripstones (DD). The Historic tour had about 100 people while the DD tour had about 150 people (70 people came from one particular company, I’m assuming who had paid for their employees to take the tour). The park has many tours, but by reading the descriptions, many of the tours are derived from one of these two tours. For example, there is a Frozen Niagara tour which you can also see on the DD tour. There is also an accessible tour for people with mobility concerns and a 6-hour crawling tour where you have the opportunity to be one with the soil and squeeze through the many cracks and crevices in the cave. Unlike Luray Caverns, this is a dry cave, so you will not see any stalagmites/stalactites. To-date Mammoth Cave has over 400 miles of passages and more passageways are constantly being discovered. Each of these tours has 500 steps to either ascend or descend. The park rangers stops periodically along the way to share some history and stories. It is cool in the cave, and although you will be walking, you may want to bring a light jacket with you, which will help especially during the times when you are standing still during the ranger talks. We booked these tours in early October and the DD tour was sold out, so be sure to book your tours well in advance. If you have the senior pass, you get a discount off of the tours, so be sure to take advantage of your park pass. Entry to the park is free. There are also many free ranger walks and talks. We went on one that described the life of Floyd Collins, who is also buried in one of the nearby cemeteries. We met a ranger at a particular spot and she took us on a short walk on a boardwalk while describing his passion for exploring caves. Then we got into your respective vehicles as she lead us to his cabin, then we got back into our vehicles to go to his gravesite. While we were there, some bikers were taking a break while paying their respects to Floyd. She concluded her tour by playing an old song on her iPad that described his life. It was a very detailed and fun way to spend an hour and a half. You don’t need to sign up for these free tours, except for one, The Discovery Tour. Once you sign up, you get a ticket for a self-guided tour. Some parts of the tour are the same as the Historic Tour while the remaining parts are totally new. Rangers are stationed throughout the path in the cave to answer any questions that you may have. Be sure to save some to time to browse through The Visitor’s Center’s museum which has posters and a video to orient yourself to the cave. On the Historic tour, you will descend the external steps (~280 steps) before entering the cave, and after a short walk, you get to the Rotunda, a tall, very wide, circular space that seemed like it was formed from a whirlpool back in the day. It’s not a challenging walk, but there are sections where you will need to duck down, especially if you are tall. And one section you will need to step up while ducking down, again this is more challenging if you are tall and the people in front of you stop to take pictures. Surprisingly, they have flush toilets that brings the waste back up to the surface (TMI, I know).The DD tour starts out by taking a 4 mile trip in converted school buses, then descending a metal staircase built into between the rock formations. There have been hundreds of thousands of people touching the railings of this staircase over the years. While I’m not a germ-a-phobe, and this is the start of cold/flu season, I was careful not to touch my eyes, nose or mouth on this tour. Bring hand sanitizer with you, you will thank me later. The same set of stairs that you used to descend into the caves on the Historic Tour you will now use to ascend from the cave. It’s equivalent to climbing 3 flights of stairs, and on a large tour such as ours, the rate of ascent was slow and steady.","October 10, 2017","Unique, a Must Attraction!",100,New Jersey,5
Mammoth Cave,"We read through a number of the one-star reviews and completely disagree. Planning ahead and making reservations will cure any of the ills they had walking up to get tickets at a popular and controlled national park.These caves were amazing in their immensity and length. Don't expect this to be a stalagmite-style cave but instead a labyrinth of tunnels cut through the earth. We chose the historic tour that took 2 hours with a distance of 2 miles walking. The ranger oversold the physical exertion needed, almost trying to scare people off the tour because of approximately 500 steps on the tour (really about 250 down and 250 up). I have bad knees and was hardly phased by the stairs.","October 9, 2017",Beware one-star reviews,36,"Atlanta, Georgia",4

When I got to Mammoth Cave, all tours were sold out except for the self-guided tour, which I did. Then I bought ticket for the next morning, & even for a solo traveler, only the Domes & Dripstones tour was available. Now I kinda know why. This tour includes the Frozen Niagara sights as well, which was probably what I should have purchased. The 0930 group I was in had 120 people, half of them were kids! We went through tight spots, descending a long flight of steps to the first room, dubbed Grand Central Station. After a lengthy Q&A session, we gathered at another cave room, & had another Q&A session. By the time we got to the main attraction at the end of the tour, the awesome rock formations & columns, we were 15 minutes over & were rushed by the guide to hurry up to the bus. I was snapping pictures on the run, & couldn't stop to even admire many of the wonderful formations at the end.

Mammoth Cave,"Don't want to sound like a cave snob, but have been through many of them, and our 2 hour historical tour was only average. Tour group sizes here are huge - 100+ people - and often include a school group or two. So, expect to be hustled quickly through the cave in a large, noisy line. Maybe I just picked the wrong tour, but there isn't much to see on the historical tour - it snakes through a part of the cave that has been heavily vandalized over the last several hundred years and it was shocking to see how bad it was scratched up. You'll pass over a couple of pits and through a narrow area, but nothing very impressive compared to many other caves. And lastly, the tour guide's (I want to say Jim, but unsure) attitude was crass and snarky. He started off the tour by telling everyone to get close together and that maybe we could all visit each other at our campsites later tonight and ""share some tubesteak."" Yes, he said that. You could see the eyebrows go up all through the group. Instead of talking about cave history, he made a point to discuss his military PTSD, have all the veterans raise their hands, and then we had to clap for the veterans. I get it, veterans are an valuable part of our country, but... we're in the cave on a cave tour. Can we talk about the cave? Overall, meh.","October 7, 2017",Just OK,45,"MIlwaukee, WI",3

Mammoth Cave,"We drove an hour and 15 minutes to get to the park. Took a 2 1/2 hour guided tour down into the caves. A Park bus drives you to and from the cave entry point. The brouchure, guide and other staff frequently warned of distance, number of stairs, etc. to weed out persons with medical issues from taking the tour. We had no problems, the descent into the cave was smooth and there were rest stops along the way. I think we did about 500 stair steps. However, there were a few couples that appeared to struggle a bit and brought up the rear of the group. If you have any medical issues you don't want something to happen in the cave. The tour was interesting, photography is very difficult, no flash allowed and most time exposures blurred a bit. It is dimly lit, enough to see your way, but that's about it. The Park guide was pleasant and knowledgeable.

They offer several tours, each with differing levels of difficulty and time length. I would recommend the Historic Tour because they not only show you around part of the cave, but they also give you a history lesson about the early explorers to the cave. The Historic Tour lasted about 2 hours. There were bathrooms in the cave about 70 minutes into the tour.If I were to go back, I would probably choose one of the other longer, more extensive tours.I know there was a lot to do above ground too.

In the cave, BE CAREFUL, as there are wet floors that are slippery when ascending or descending sloped pathways, hold onto handbars where available, be comfortable walking four miles or standing about for the ranger-talks over the four hours. There is only one pit stop or bathroom break in the cave.

I was really looking forward to seeing some of the caverns, but traveling across country it was unaffordable. The staff at the information counter was not very friendly either. Check out the Onyx Caves and the folks at the Diamond caverns, super nice, inexpensive and over all a far better experience.

Mammoth Cave,"Growing up on the east coast, I had been to Luray Caverns a bunch as a kid. I figured all caves were the same. WRONG. This one is a dry cave, meaning none of those stalactites and mites but it has features that I had never seen before, was deep and wide and never ending. The Historical Tour was about 2 miles of walking. It wasn't fast and there were a lot of stops to listen about interesting facts and history, so not strenuous at all. The only thing I would warn about is someone with knee issues might not enjoy the steps. However, there is a tour for that issue (accessibility tour). I'm a shutter bug and would have loved to have more time to take those slow shutter photos, but we would have been there another hour! I got enough. Because I kept lagging, I was in the back which had a follow up Ranger to make sure no one was left behind. I feel like we got a private tour of additional information for just being last!

There is a four mile bus ride to and from the tour site. The ranger did a pretty good job giving us history and factoids about the cave. It’s about 280 steps down almost immediately with lots of tight spaces - it’s also dark in areas and occasionally a little slippery. Physically, it’s difficult at moments but not throughout. It lasted about two hours though so plan for plenty of time. It’s worth it. Beautiful - though if you’ve been to Luray in Virginia, not quite as breathtaking.

Mammoth Cave,"There are several tours scheduled each and every day. They range from handicap accessible to a six-hours worth of belly crawls and squeezes. There are also different tours offered each season. Most tours seemed to be around the two hour mark, though they seem to go by much quicker. The rangers are friendly and knowledgeable. They regale you with stories and historical information. The sights are enjoyable, especially if you admire nature and think of what it is you are actually walking through. I definitely advise booking your tours in advance, as some sell out very quickly. If you go to the NP website, you will get detailed information on the size, length, difficulty, and focus of each tour. In addition to the tours, there are multiple trails (walking, bike, and horse), ranger walks, and nighttime presentations. As with the cave tours, they range in difficulties and length. If you walk on the Heritage Trail (handicap accessible), make sure to go later in the day so that you can enjoy the view at Sunset Point. The sunset also makes for very unique pictures of the Old Guide's Cemetery, if you catch it at the right time. In the three days we camped at the NP, we did three cave tours, multiple trails, and two nighttime talks.

Mammoth Cave,"Which Tour to take? I took two tours, the first was the Historic Tour. I liked this one the best. It's advertised as 2-hours but part of that was the introduction and walk to the cave entrance. Its mostly a nice casual walk, and to my surprise included a bathroom stop. Not as beautiful as other caves, but the rooms are huge and jaw dropping in some sections. Yes, the group is large, but you can still hear the guide fine. This was was 2 hours and 2 miles.The other tour was the Domes and Dripstones Tour. This tour is less than half the length of the Historic Tour but is more strenuous. But there are numerous stops as you ascend up the passageways. Some people complain about the stairs at the end, but if you can walk up a hotel staircase to the third floor with no problem you will be fine. A few tight places, but many times its only up to your waist. No big deal. Its advertised as 2 hours, but that also includes the 7-minute each way bus to the cave entrance and ranger introduction. Underground, maybe 1:30 minutes tops!If you can only do one, I would pick the Historic Tour, but try to do more than one if you can. No need to over dress, you will be walking a lot, so wear something light, I got hot and took off my jacket, long pants and long sleeve shirt was fine for me.The Visitor Center is worth spending time in, so make sure you do that too. Gift shops and eating options means make sure you spend more than just a few hours doing a tour.I stayed overnight, glad I did. I choose the Historic Cottages, they are heated and have AC. They look a little rough around the edges outside, but inside they are very nice, but remember, this is National Park accommodations, many were built in the 1950's. Saw Whitetail Deer and Wild Turkeys right outside my front door. Cave City is only a short drive away with places to stay and eat too, but I always prefer to stay in the park if I can. Hiking trails and a night sky filled with countless stars made staying over night as much fun as the underground tours.Photos are outside, most of my pictures inside came out dark, review professional photos online to get a better idea what the cave looks like underground.Me, male, 55","September 29, 2017",Which Tour to Take?

Mammoth Cave,"The first time we went by Mammoth Cave, years ago, their tour schedules didn't work with our schedule so we didn't stop. This time we stopped and have decided that 'Mammoth Cave is COOL!' We were too late to get Frozen Niagra tour tickets but did the Discovery Self guided tour. This was a nice one to do, especially with kids, because we could take our time and stop to look at things. Rangers were in the cave to answer any and all questions. All the rangers were super nice. There is even a place at the Mammoth Cave Hotel where your dogs can stay while you explore the cave. It wasn't very costly either.","September 27, 2017",The cave is COOL!!,130,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5
Mammoth Cave,"My wife and I love this place. She has family in Kentucky, and anytime we visit them, we have to take a trip to the cave. We have been on pretty much every tour of any length we can and have never been disappointed. The history is amazing. I've seen several reviews of people getting rushed through the tours. I have never felt rushed and have always had fun Rangers. Great place.","September 27, 2017",Favorite,9,"Benbrook, Texas",5
Mammoth Cave,"We took the historic tour, and it was very interesting and informative. There aren't stalactites and stalagmites on this tour, and it takes about 2 hours. Climbing the tower of stairs was somewhat strenuous, if climbing is an issue. The Park ranger who led us through was very jovial and entertaining. My children enjoyed the tour very much. I get a wee bit bored with area after area of rock, but I enjoyed the history. Everything we heard spurred discussion with my children later on in the day, and that was great.","September 26, 2017",Lovely Tour,232,"Marietta, Georgia",4
Mammoth Cave,"Came here with son and grandson to celebrate his 10th birthday weekend. Over the years, I have been coming here as a child, as a teenager, as a young married and finally to treat my son and his cousin to an adventuresome weekend years ago. Now it was the grandson's turn. And it was a truly rewarding and enjoyable experience. We made lots of memories. The cave tours have changed a little over the years. I can remember when I was young taking the Echo River tour in the flat bottom boats. And eating in the snowball dining room after a long tour - best veggie soup there ever was. But no longer do they exist. We took both the historic tour and the domes and dripstones tour. Both are as advertised with some strenuous walking and lots and lots of stairs. And both are well worth the money. A very big suggestion and one that I'm very glad I did - make advance reservations for any tour. When we arrived on Saturday, most of the tours were sold out early. And that would've been bad with a very disappointed youngster. Place has a lot of outside walking areas also. Appears to be doing some remodeling to the hotel and bridgework around it. It's a fun place to visit with friends or family.","September 26, 2017",This Place Has Some Great Memories,120,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5

We went on the Frozen Niagara Tour, which was nice as it showed both active and inactive cave sections and was a relatively short tour. There is also a nice, small museum at the visitor's center. There are also various trails on the topside that can be enjoyed.","September 25, 2017",Frozen Niagara Tour,53,"Batesville, Indiana",4
Mammoth Cave,"We did the Grand Avenue tour which is described as strenuous - and strenuous it is. We were able to walk at a fast pace through much of the cave. However, it was so fast that we did not have time to view the cave because of having to watch our footing. And we were absolutely unable to take photographs as we were instructed to stay together and keep moving. There were a few stops on the tour where we were able to take photos. Our guide did not permit many questions. Also on our stops he told jokes rather than much history or description of the cave. We were able to go down the steps to see the Niagra Falls. However, our guide said go down, take your photo, and go back up! No time to look around!I would suggest taking the shorter tours where you have time to actually view the cave!We also took the Mammoth Passage Tour which was at a slower pace where we were able to look around. Our guide for that tour was very informative and was happy to answer any questions. ","September 25, 2017",Disappointing Tour,84,"Georgetown, Ohio",4

Mammoth Cave,Visited Mammouth Cave for three days in mid September. Nice National Park with no entrance fee which is unusual. First thing - If you want to do any of the Cave Tours get your tickets on-line in advance. Most of them sold out while we were there. Cave temperature is in the mid 50s all the time. It was 85 when we were there so a lot on people went on the tours in shorts and short sleeves. They regretted it! It was very cool in the cave. Pay close attention to the tour descriptions. They do a good job of describing how physically challenging they are. The ones with 700 steps are an effort. I am 66 years old and in good shape but the tours wore me out. The tours are interesting and well led by the rangers. The rest of the park is basically wooded with some nice hiking trails. Shop around for lodging outside the park and you can get some good rates. Park rates were to high. A lot of things in the area for families to do after seeing the cave. The trip to Bowling Green for the Corvette Museum is well worth the effort. On site hotel restaurant was ok but over priced for the quality of the food. When we were there was also some construction going on around the visitor center. The projected completion date is not until some time in 2018.,"September 24, 2017",Interesting Place Different Style National Park,14,"Bunker Hill, United States",4

Mammoth Cave,"Definitely an incredible place to visit. We took two cave tours and both were interesting but where comfortable shoes, it is a lot of walking. The trails and hiking around the park are also worth exploring. It rained our entire visit thanks to Irma but at least she couldn't interfere with the cave tours! And we made the best of the rest of our visit in the rain as well.","September 19, 2017",A Natural Wonder,88,"La Crosse, Wisconsin, United States",5
Mammoth Cave,"The historic tour was good to provide information about the tour. However I wish I knew a couple things before I went. First, the guide stops and waits for everyone to join him before sharing stories so no need to run to the front of the tour. Second, it's 54 degrees inside the cave all year round. Dress for it.Third, there are very cramped areas that you have to wiggle thru. Be prepared to to walk for a good 200 feet while hunched over, unless your 5 feet tall or shorter, you can walk thru it.They tell you to dress for cold weather and be prepared for a hike but that didn't cover it for me. I really felt I should have gotten a little more detail then that.Oh and do not be fooled they say everyone is very friendly at the park. I didn't talk to a single employee who was happy to be there and I wouldn't call them friendly either. They just seemed to want to get done with their shift and go home. I don't feel I should know that about them as a one time visitor.","September 19, 2017",Historic Tour,3,,4
Mammoth Cave,"There are several tours to select from. We selected the Historical Tour. Be advised...even during the off season one will need to purchase tickets in advance. They ran 6 tours the day we were there and all sold out with 112 people on each tour. The caves are magical to see. There are some very tight, narrow, and short spots that one much venture through. These make the trip more interesting but can be a challenge for some. My only recommendation would be to add a little more history to the tour and less people per tour. It appeared the guide talked most of the way through the tour but with such a large group only the ones right behind him could hear. We only stopped about 3-4 times for the whole groups to hear.

Mammoth Cave,"This Park is a little different then most National Parks we have been to. The first thing we noticed was there is no admission fee. There was however fees to take any of the several cave tours offered. Our Access Card which usually gives us half off attractions was only good for the individual card holder, not our immediate family like at other Parks. We choose the Historical Tour for the amount of information offered and the ease of walking. It was a nice walk but not worth half what we paid. Our guide was very informative but the cave itself was unimpressive. Sure it's big but it lacks color and formations found in other caves in the Park System. Ongoing research within the cave system is ongoing and provides student caverns experience. The Park also offers a very nice Visitor Center, lodging, camping, hiking and small store. Overall it was a nice Park just don't let your expectations of the cave be to high. ","September 18, 2017",A Little Different ,105,"Lake Havasu City, Arizona",4

We were driven to a spot about a mile from the cave entrance and taken by elevator down into the cave where there used to be a restaurant. The trail is a quarter mile each way and is wheel chair friendly. Our guides were knowledgeable and answered all questions. When we left we were informed about white nose syndrome which is killing the bats who live in the cave and had our shoes sprayed to help prevent the spread of the disease. I found this a definite ecological plus.","September 17, 2017",Friendly and helpful staff,79,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5
Mammoth Cave,"This national park is all about the underworld: the largest cave system in the world, with hunderds of miles of caves. It is not possible to explore the caves on your own, you have to book a tour at the visitor's center or online. The ranger guided tours are excellent, I took the 4 hour Grand Avenue Tour ($26). Don't expect many stalagmites and stalagtites. They are scarce, the only bigger one is the Frozen Niagara, part of the Grand Avenue Tour. The cave are large corridors below the ground, sometime wide, sometimes curving and very narrow. The upperworld is also nice, with nice trails through the woods close to the Green River. Part of the river goes onderground forming new caves (Styx). There are many birds and mammals. There is no entrance fee, you only have to pay for the tours.

Did not have a good grip on time of arrival so I did not purchase advance tickets, and even though I arrived before 11am, the special tours were all sold out so I just did the historic cave entrance. That alone was pretty darn cool in my book! Still hard to believe I was in the start of a 400 mile system of caves. Buy those tickets ahead if you want to see the really stellar parts of the cave system. The Visitors Center has a great displays that tell more about the whole park.

There are a lot of steps in both direction so being in an average shape is required. A lot of maintenance of pathways has been completed that helps with the walk. Good solid hand rails and cement stairs makes most of the walk relatively easy. This was not the tour to see stalagmites and stalactites. That is a different tour.

The caves have been made more walkable with flooring, but it does not feel that you are at a national park, but an amusement park. The crowds I am sure is what forced the national park to increase safety as well as get more people through. Book your tour days in advance or you may not get to take one on the day you want.

Some good stories about the cave at two different stops with seats and one stop that was standing. Good workout, 280 steps straight down. Probably the same coming up, but not all at once. Amazed at the number of tourists who don't listen to the instructions - Do not touch the stone and don't shine your flashlight at the bats. Or maybe they listen and think it doesn't apply to them.

Mammoth Cave,"Did not expect the cave to be so wide open. We did the historic tour which was about 2 miles of walking. Some parts were easy walking and other parts (fat man's misery etc.) were a little difficult. Actually slipped a couple times in that section and it was hard to manuever and I'm not even a fat man, just a tall one. Many sections had to be hunched over through. They warn you in advance, but still bumped my head a few times. Also, a lot of stairs to climb back up after having gone down. It is what it is, just warning you. Some places were really neat and pretty amazing to see. We also did the domes and dripstones tour which was 3/4 of a mile, but that 3/4 of a mile seemed to wear us out more than the 2 mile Historic tour. Not sure why. Just more cramped experience I think and more frequent stairs and careful movement required to get around. Beware the cave crickets at the end!!! Mammoth Cave is not really a show cave so not much in the way of stalagmites and stalagtites etc. It was still very neat to see and if you're in the area, I recommend spending 1/2 a day to a whole day checking it out.

Make sure and get at least a couple tours, one in the dry part and one in the wet part. The historic entrance is cool, literally:-D When you get close you can feel the blast of cold air coming out. You won't find stalactites and stalagmites in this part of the cave though. It's the dry part. You need to go in another entrance to see those. The hiking trails are beautiful. Kentucky is so green.

We had a crew of maybe 100-150 on the tour with two National Park guides. The cave tour was absolutely amazing, well informed and just spectacular. These are the largest caves in the world.

Mammoth Cave,"Took the ranger led Domes and Dripstones tour with over 100 others. This is the world's longest cave system, an underground labrynth comprising over 400 miles of interlocking caves used as far back as 4,000 years ago. 500 steps in and out, 280 to get 250' down, some rock carved, some metal, mostly narrow at a cost of $ 3,000 per step! Really. We bussed to the roughly hewn entrance. Initially the cave is dry with few formations, but as we got lower, it became wetter, with more formations like stalactites and mites. There are a few domes and a pit at 250' where the tour stopped to learn about the history of the place. Water flows below. Temperature is pretty constant and earthquakes don't affect the place. The Drapery Room looks like pleated drapes, the Snowball Room looks like hundreds of shimmering snowballs in the light and Frozen Niagara looks like a smaller frozen version of its namesake. I saw some small black bats, long legged spiders and a pale centipede like insect. There are cave drawings etched on some walls. Since my visit, I learnt that slaves helped build the place and are buried near the entrance including the first guide, Stephen Bishop. Many died within from TB and the work. The caves are considered one of the largest human haunts in the world. Mummified remains have been found dating back centuries. There's an old Saltpeter mine site used to create gunpowder in the war in 1812.

I was too busy trying to keep up with the group of 118 people! The cave paths and steps are often narrow so we had to proceed in single file so it's not like the guide could point out any of these interesting items to us.

The park overall is very pretty and definitely worth seeing.","August 24, 2017","Good to see, pack well though",19,"Asheville, North Carolina",4
Mammoth Cave,"This was a truly beautiful park with a well-maintained, well-staffed visitors center. Above ground, the park's trail system is extensive and includes paths for hiking and biking. The hiking trail we explored was well-marked and also well-maintained. The small museum was informative and seamlessly tied geology and history together. Below ground, the caves were magnificent, especially within the rotunda. It is worth purchasing a $5 self-guided tour ticket to see the caves if you would prefer to avoid taking an extended tour with a guide. With the self-guided tour, you may take your time and explore the caves as much as you'd like. However, you are not permitted to go far. I probably would have rated the park higher if I had seen more of it. Looking forward to a return visit!","August 24, 2017",Looking Forward to a Return Visit,40,"Winchester, Virginia",4
Mammoth Cave,"I'm not sure how this compares with other caves, but it was quite impressive. We took the $5 self-guided tour and spent about 45 minutes in them, though you could stay longer if you wanted to. There are guided tours in the exact same place as the self-guided tours, so if you want the 1.5 hour history lesson, that is a good option, but with young kid (5 years old), the self-guided option was better for us so we could go at our own pace. There are other guided tours you can pay for that take you into other areas which are restricted from the self-guided tour, and if we had more time or planned in advance (as they were all sold out when we went), it surely would have been interesting to see too.","August 23, 2017",Have to see to believe!,1,,4
Mammoth Cave,"As a middle school earth science teacher, I highly recommend the cave tours to anyone and everyone. It was a very informative and fun tour.

Mammoth Cave,"I enjoyed this tour (Domes & Dripstones) but if I had it to do over again, I would position myself in the middle of the rather large (100-ish) group rather than right behind the ranger, who had indicated that that would be the ""slow and steady"" position. Although he was walking at a relatively slow pace with his hands in his pockets, clearly not the least bit stressed out, we found that keeping up with him was fairly challenging and that it was so necessary to watch where we were putting our feet that we had no time to look around us and admire the caves. I caught onto this towards the end, picked a spot farther back, and had much more opportunity to look around me.The rangers stated that it was an individual decision to take a tour and that they were not permitted to tell anyone that they couldn't participate. Fair enough. Well-needed warnings were then given to the group waiting to get on the bus to go to the entrance. I say ""well-needed"" because our group included an elderly, overweight woman wearing flip-flops, and a woman carrying a tiny infant in a sling across her chest. How either of these people thought that this tour would be appropriate for them boggles my mind. I lost track of the people at the very back of the large group, but I'm hoping both those women thought better of it and went back to the visitor center on the bus.Also, be aware that if you don't have a reservation for a guided tour, you might either not get the tour you'd like to take, or there might be a wait until the next one goes out. There are several different tours for different interests and abilities.I'm glad I took the time to do this on my way through the area. It was a bit more challenging than I'd thought it would be (mostly speed-wise, not the actual moving through the caves and up and down the stairs) but I enjoyed my visit.","August 23, 2017","Interesting, but needs a few pointers before signing up",40,"Concord, New Hampshire",4
Mammoth Cave,"We were able to get five last minute tickets for the Mammoth Cave Historical Tour on the same day as the Eclipse for the 3:15 tour. Tickets for the weekend seemed to be sold out that morning so we hadn't expected to make it work. We were pleasantly surprised, though it did take my husband going back up to the ticket desk several times over the hour to see if anything had changed. His perseverance won out. Though they said the tour was full, the Tour Guide and Ranger was surprised at one point in the tour where we all sat on benches that so many people were missing from the 120 person tour. Perhaps they changed their minds considering traffic out of the area would be insane the longer they waited? Their loss, our gain. Please, be advised when they say that this is a somewhat strenuous walk, you should believe them. We are a fairly healthy active family with young adult children and it was not a problem in the least, but some areas are very narrow, you have to almost crawl through a few tight spots, and it is a long tour underground...not for the heftier sized tourists or people with claustrophobia. I would actually not recommend this tour for young children either, since it is about 2 hours, without restrooms, in the dark, and is a quiet tour. There were a few families with very young children, and though they were well behaved, it was a huge distraction trying to hear descriptions from the Guide while their children played and talked to each other. Just my opinion of course. The air temperature drops to around the 50's so take layers and wear sturdy shoes. The paths are dark despite some lighting and you could easily trip or stub a toe. You may take pictures but flash photography is not allowed. Also do not stray from the path, they will make sure you follow all rules. No graffiti is allowed obviously. When you exit the cave you will walk through a sanitizing solution to prevent the fecal matter from bats to leave with you due to a bacterial infection that has wiped out a massive number of bats in the USA, and is present in Mammoth Caves. We did not see any bats but they are there and you will be warned how to handle any interactions should they occur. The historical descriptions were entertaining and informative. We really learned a lot on this tour. You will not see the beautiful Stalactites or Stalagmites you see at Luray Caverns. The really draw is how extensive these caves are. The adventurer in you will wish to explore more than you will get to see in your two mile walk. At the visitor center there is a small museum area that was very informative. I would recommend checking it out before your tour if you can. They also offer camping, lodging, and a dining area and gift shops. THis is a must see if you can get tickets when in the area.","August 23, 2017",The Historic Tour is the way to go!,127,Maryland,4
Mammoth Cave,"Our family was venturing to Clarksville, TN from Northern Indiana for the total solar eclipse. We decided to stop at Mammoth Cave on Sunday, August 20th and are so glad that we did! It was a balmy 95 degrees when we entered the park and it was packed with people who had the same idea we did. Regardless of the influx of people, our self guided tour of the cave, via the Historic Entrance, was a perfect retreat from the extreme heat! As a family who holds education near and dear, we really enjoyed the Rangers passion for their work and their willingness to answer a bombardment of questions. We will definitely be back for an extended weekend! ","August 22, 2017",Excellent Stop!,2,,5
Mammoth Cave,"Ok I was going to give this 4 stars, because there is less of the wow factor, but then I thought about it. Of th entire world we have the largest cave system in the world and you get the opportunity to see it!! You should be so lucky!!! I went to Carlsbad caverns and it was all about the water formations. Here the caves have a ""Roof"" which keeps it from leaking all the cool formations. There is only one area that has these formations so pls go visit it so you can see it. The majority of the caves are created from a river thousands of years ago, and you have no drip formations. The website threatens that you need reservations but I went the day of and got exactly what I wanted. I wish their park video focused on the natural phenomena instead of the boring story of people we kicked out to create the park. You have the largest cave system in the world!

Turns out one was almost too much for my mother and we should have heeded the warnings. They would have been happy to reschedule her on another tour. They were kind to refund her fee four the second tour. Kids did the junior ranger program and were forced to prove what they learned to earn a badge.

Mammoth Cave,"We are so blessed to live only 30 minutes or so away from this fabulous national park. The cave tours are top notch and with so many choices, there is a tour for just about every preference. Just be sure to book early as the tours fill up fast on busier days and weekends.Even though the cave is the star of the show, there are a number of other activities here. We return again and again with our grandson to see the interactive display at the visitor center. It's fun and interesting for folks of all ages. The hiking here is really nice as well. Our favorite short hike is Green River Bluff trail that starts not far from the visitor center. In the summer, it's cool and shaded, with lovely glimpses of the Green River and the terrain is suitable for most hikers. And the bluff views in the winter are spectacular. This trail connects with several others near the visitor center giving you enough mileage for a substantial afternoon hike. Deer are frequently seen on the trail and else where in the park, and we love visit the Green River ferry landing when we hike in this area.The Green River is wonderful for kayaking and canoeing and local outfitters can set you up for a trip of a few hours or even over nights. Lots of folks bring their own equipment and enjoy a day on the river, and with a back country permit you can plan your own overnight adventure. Most of the time the river is easy going and family friendly river, but if you get weather upstream, water levels can rise very quickly. Lots of folks fish along the way, and you do not need a license to fish within the park boundaries.More hiking is available in the back country, reached by crossing the Green River on the free ferry. This area also has a nice parking area for horse trailers and a fair amount of riding. We also enjoy the mountain biking trails in the back country. Our hybrids handle the trails just fine and the hardwood forest is beautiful here.One of our favorite activities at the park is biking or jogging on the Mammoth Cave Railroad Bike and Hiking Trail. It's 9 miles one way and includes two challenging hills at either end that make for a good workout. The trail surface is well maintained and can be accessed at several points in the park. We like to start at the camp store for easy access to the restrooms, water, and a nice cold soda. A worthwhile stop along the way is at Sloan's Pond where you will find a boardwalk surrounding a wetland area with lots of frogs, turtles, and occasionally other wild life. Several tables are available here and it's a great, shady spot for a picnic. This trail is shaded for much of the way and is a nice gravel surface that is workable for most bikes.Mammoth Cave National Park is our number one outdoor go-to spot and one of those places we always bring visitors. The visitor center is a great place to peolple watch and we meet people from all over the world here. We are very grateful to be so close to this national treasure!","August 21, 2017",A National Treasure,23,,5

Mammoth Cave,"I am moderately claustrophobic was a little apprehensive about taking the Historic Tour of Mammoth Cave after reading the reviews here. I was a little more apprehensive after listening to the ranger describe the ""Fat Man's Misery"" and ""Tall Man's Dilemma"" sections of the cave during the pre-tour, and I almost bailed. I saw some people who appeared to be in their 70s and some who appeared to be walking with a little difficulty talk to a ranger about whether they should take the tour, and after he cleared their participation, I decided to take a chance. I am glad I did. Most of the tour was in areas with high ceilings, and there were just a handful of areas where I had to duck my head or bend my knees for a minute or so (I am 5'6""). The narrow ""Fat Man's Misery"" section, which is about 2/3 of the way into the tour, is not as bad as it sounds. The narrow part is mostly below waist level, and sometimes you have to turn a little sideways to get through, but you never have to squeeze through a narrow passage at chest or head height. Some reviewers have said that you can get through this passage in a few seconds, but that might be a little optimistic. It depends on where you are in the group. You may have up to 120 people on your tour, and each one needs to go through single file. Realizing this, my family made sure that we were at the head of the line so we could keep moving through the section before any bottle necks occurred. It took me maybe two minutes to get through the section, but people at the end of the line were stopped in the section waiting for those in front of them to progress, and probably spent at least twice as long there. There were some other narrow areas, but none where I had to turn to the side. Also, don't let the fact that you have to climb up seven flights of stairs at the end scare you off -- if you make sure you are at the back of the line for this part of the tour, the people ahead of you will go slowly and you'll be pausing and resting very frequently on the steps. The tour itself? Very informative. I learned a lot, and the stories were interesting. There are few ""wow"" moments visually, but still very much worth the trip. I considered going back and doing a self-guided tour of the same area we had just done because I had spent so much time trying to get through the cave (because of my apprehension) that I felt I had missed some of the experience. Unfortunately, our schedule wouldn't allow it. But I will go back one day and do it again!When I go back, I might wear jeans -- I wore capris and a hoodie and was comfortable, but I get cold easily so jeans might be better. I wore running shoes, which were helpful because there are a few slippery spots and a lot of walking. Some people wore hiking boots, but those seemed unnecessary. I will also bring water in a cooler and leave it in the car, because we had to wander around a few minutes after the tour to find water. So, don't let claustrophobia hold you back! Enjoy!","August 21, 2017",Fine for moderate claustrophobic,98,"Ellicott City, MD",4
Mammoth Cave,"My son and I took the Domes and Dripstones tour at Mammoth Cave. We booked online a few weeks in advanced and glad we did as all tours were sold out during our weekend at the park. $15/ person on this 2 hour tour and it's well worth it. Beautiful chambers, tight passageways, hundreds of stairs, stories from the guides, and the cool quiet dampness all make this tour a great experience. You can look at all the pictures you want but being in the cave is how you should truly experience it. This specific tour is fine for young children as many families were in our group.

Mammoth Cave,"Way different national park in that everything is underground. Need to be prepared to hike down into caves about 500 feet. Although there are recently finished paths there are areas which require sure footing, bending into smaller areas, low ceilings (watch your head), some areas are wet so footing can be an issue and it's low light or complete darkness. Hiking shoes recommended. I would rate the physical activity as moderate. If you're claustrophobic consider not going some of the paths are narrow. The ranger guides very informative. Remember your down in the ground about 500 feet so you have to climb back up 500 feet. Luckly you can use a staircase. All in all a great adventure.

For those with acrophobia, the stairway is doable but not necessarily easy :)One last point: since the caves are well below the surface, they are a little cool in temps (even when it's 90 degrees outside).

Mammoth Cave,"A visit to Mammoth Cave National Park is more than a one-day adventure. Stay at the Mammoth Cave Hotel, arrange for one of the National Park Service's several cave tours and also enjoy in other recreational activities available to visitors, including surface hikes, canoeing on the Green River, horseback riding, picnicking, bicycling and camping. But Mammoth Cave is what attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors annually. Established in 1941, Mammoth Cave National Park covers 52,830 acres, primarily in Edmonson County and centered on the Green River. With a total of 405 miles of surveyed passageways, the cave is by far the world's longest known cave system, nearly twice as long as the second-longest system, Mexico's Sac Actun underwater cave. According to legend, the first European to discover Mammoth Cave was either John Houchin or his brother Francis Houchin in 1797. While hunting, they pursued a wounded bear to the cave's large entrance near the Green River. Some of the notable features are Grand Avenue, Frozen Niagara and Fat Man's Misery. To access Mammoth Cave from the north, take I-65 to exit 53, turn right onto Kentucky 70 and follow it as it becomes Mammoth Cave Parkway into the park to the visitor's center. It's a good starting point for a day or two of breath-taking exploration.

Mammoth Cave,"Tucked away in the pretty hills and forests of Kentucky is this welcoming national park. It was fairly quiet when we were there in August (think many schools had already started) yet the cave tours were busy and many were sold out. I took advice from here to purchase tickets in advance. Recreation.gov is an easy to use site that allows you to book tours in advance. Just bring the confirmation number you receive to get your tickets at the visitor center when you arrive. You can also find a good explanation of all the tours there or on the national park site.We did the violet city lantern tour as it covers many of the shorter tours in the 3 miles/3hour tour. Also, I thought it would be more interesting using the lanterns. We were told at the park that this tour always sells out along with the Grand Avenue tour (if you put these 2 together you'll cover the majority of the tour route, FYI). It was surprising how easy it was to navigate using the lanterns. The harder part was actually at the beginning where there is some artificial light before proceeding into the unlit area. We definitely enjoyed our tour. It didn't feel like 3 hours and despite the warnings about how strenuous it was, it wasn't really that bad. The hardest part is at the end where there is a steep ascent including both hard packed ground and stairs to get to the Violet City exit. There was one person on our tour that had trouble with that and really needed to stop to catch her breath. Otherwise, you might get a little winded but it's a very small portion of the tour. We strolled most of the way with stops. Our tour guide (ugh hate to say it - she was very nice) wasn't the best. She just failed to convey her stories with convinicng emotion to capture our attention and too often she just didn't know answers to questions.It is chilly - even my warm blooded husband and daughter got chilly after a while (sweatshirt was enough). I am always easily chilled - I wore pants, sweatshirt and light jacket. I wish I had some little gloves because my hands got chilly. Heard others in our tour with shorts and t-shirts saying they were chilly but not one was really suffering. Lanterns area actually easy to carry. Only about 1 in 4 carry a lantern.We found that tour to be enough for us but we did consider domes and dripstones (i think that's the name).On the flip side, there are several surface activities that can round out a visit to the park. There is a nice crushed gravel bike trail running from the visitor center to Park City. For fun, if you can take it to Park City and be picked up there, you'll have an easy ride. Coming back from Park City can be a little hilly. Lots of shade on much of the trail to stay a little cool and some stops to look at historical spots. Also, there are many trails to explore. Some right around the visitor center which are popular but we did a few further out and they were empty. So pretty in these woods and some easy little hikes, too. We just always had to have our bravest out front with a stick to break slider webs which were abundant on the lesser used trails. We also enjoy picnicking at the picnic area while there. Despite the large number of cars in the parking lot, few used the picnic grounds. They are so nice, with nice bathroom facilities and just a comfortable setting to relax for a while. We enjoyed the visitor center, too, with lots of info on the cave and history. The area is pretty. We camped at Nolin Lake State Park which is about 45 minutes away by car. Other closer options include the park itself - campground, hotel, some little cabin things. Or Cave City had options.","August 14, 2017",Another great national park,350,"Saint Paul, Minnesota",5

If you are not steady on your feet, have a hard time climbing up or down stairs, can not walk while bent over or are severely claustrophobic, neither of these tours are for you! Both were a blast to see and climb through. I was a little concerned about the claustrophobic aspect but there were only a few spots that you went through that were pretty close together and they didn't last for longer than a few seconds at a time.

Mammoth Cave,"I love National Parks. Have been to several, but never made it down to Mammoth which is odd considering its rather close location to my home and my affinity for NP's in general.I am so glad we made the trip, such a great park on all fronts. The park itself is, as with most National Parks, beautiful and well maintained. There are camping spots as well as hiking and biking trails that all trend toward the easy side. The visitor center (the park only has one that is centrally located to the main cave entrances) is quite nice. There is a smallish but well-informed museum inside as well as multiple gift shops (4 in total, 1 that is run by the park service) and a place to eat and refill water bottles. The visitor center is also the main hub and the reason everyone goes to mammoth - the cave tours. There are screens that will give you updated info on tour times and tour specifics (sites, length and difficulty) as well as a manned ranger station. Everything is quite easy to navigate. Let's talk tours... know this though, most tours sell out in advance. The two most popular tours (the Frozen Niagara and Domes and Dripstones) seem to always do so. I've done 4 tours there and have enjoyed all of them. Which do I recco? If you can only do one tour go with either the Domes and Dripstones or the Historic. Both offer a 2 hour experience and contain smaller tours within their plotted routes (for example the popular Frozen Niagara is seen in its entirety on the Domes and Dripstones tour) Each of these tours will run you around $12-$15 for an adult.Domes and Dripstones offers a very cool (54 degrees year round) descent into a newer area of the cave. After catching a 8 minute bus ride to the entrance, you enter through a sinkhole that was blasted out. Then traverse down along a narrow path of stairs and tunnels. It's quite awesome, granted if you don't mind the occasional height and tight space... it is a cave after all. But even most young children can do this with no problem. There are a few stops that the ranger will gather the group and speak about things, and give you a rest before going further within the cave. You end up finishing with the Frozen Niagara and Drapery Room areas which are both considered Mammoth highlights. Highly recommended. The Historic tour, like its name implies, gives you more history of the cave and also takes around 2 hours to do. You enter through the main ""historic"" entrance which is a short walk from the visitor center. Most of this tour shows off the cave's size with huge passage ways and grand-scaled junctions throughout. There are some tight spaces, namely the infamous section called fat-man's misery, but it was quite easy to get through and my kids (3 under the age of 10) all loved it. They even loved crossing the ""bottomless"" pit before hitting another Mammoth highlight, The Mammoth Dome. From there the most strenuous part of the tour is a 3/4 story tower of stairs you climb to exit this part of the cave. I'm no fitness guru, but I didn't find any of this hard to do. The Historic tour is another popular one and I can see why. My family and I really enjoyed our visit. We will be back.Highly Recommended.","August 11, 2017",A Great National Park to Add to Your List.,8,Ohio,5

Mammoth Cave,"I first visited Mammoth Cave NP in 2004. It was a little less developed than it is today. I camped the first time around and the Camper Store is still there. They've added an excellent visitor's center since the last time I visited. This time I dragged my brother and his family along. We bought tickets a week ahead of our visit on-line for three cave tours: Grand Avenue, Violet City Lantern, and Intro to Caving. The first two hikes are the longest and most strenuous of the hikes offered at Mammoth Cave NP (except for the Wild Caving tour at 6 miles). Many if not most of the longer tours are sold out ahead of time. We enjoyed all of our tours. Rangers Jeff and Chris led the Grand Avenue tour on a pretty quick pace (4 miles in 4 hours), but they were very professional and entertaining. We were fortunate enough to get Ranger Jerry Bransford (great-great grandson of Materson Bransford: one of the first African-American cave guides) for our Violet City Lantern tour. He brought the history of Mammoth Cave alive like no one else could. Finally, we had Rangers Rachel and Luke for our Intro to Caving tour. They were both excellent, enthusiastic, and professional. We had a great time crawling, climbing, and squeezing through areas that the average visitor to the park never gets to see. Oh yes, the dining facilities are quite good. The Spelunker's Cafe and Ice Cream Parlor serves pre-made sandwiches, hot dogs, hamburgers, pulled pork sandwiches, and ice cream (all very good, and the ice cream is locally made). The prices were reasonable. The Green River Grill is a sit-down restaurant with separate breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus. We came for lunch and had to try their Kentucky Hot Brown, shrimp and grits, and warm bourbon pecan pie. Again, the prices were reasonable. All in all, a fantastic two day visit.","August 9, 2017",Still Fun the Second Time Around,101,"Cumberland, Rhode Island",5

Mammoth Cave,"My three brothers and I did the Grand Avenue Tour. This was my first time in a cave like this and it was an incredible experience. If you want to see a good chunk of the cave system at a reasonably fast pace, I recommend this tour.According to the National Park site, the tour that we went on was of 'strenuous' difficulty. If you are in reasonably good shape, this tour should be no problem. My brothers and I range in age from 19 to 25. I do advise comfortable walking shoes; I just went with my ASICs running shoes and I did not slip or anything. The are several staircases. Make sure you book well in advance. Due to the pace, photography is difficult on this tour. Camera tripods were also not allowed. Overall, I highly recommend going on the tour.

Mammoth Cave,"This is a review of the hardest tour of many that are offered, the Wild Cave Tour.My God, this is pretty hardcore. One of our group of 14 was happy not to even set off, having been briefed on what to expect.This is about immersing yourselves in caving, far less about looking at the views, history, environment etc. That said, plenty of information is imparted throughout the experience and the guides were always happy to chat when not instructing. Another decided to bail at the half way point.You'll be crawling through holes you didn't think were possible to get through. And there's a bit of climbing, scrambling and edging over crevices too. The guides were excellent, we never felt in any danger. It was exhilarating stuff and where necessary, they tutored on technique. You actually can't go ig you are larger than a 42 inch chest I think! You get the picture?You don't have to be athletes but you do have to be reasonably fit, and not be at all fazed by enclosed spaces or heights. It's one for people who like a challenge, and to stretch themselves.An absolute must for thrill seekers and experience junkies. Well worth travelling up from Nashville (as we did) for. It's an easy drive, that necessitates an early start. We made it in time for breakfast - the cafe opens at 8. This could also be good for a rainy day!You'll really feel a sense of achievement once you complete this ""tour""!","August 8, 2017",Wild Cave Day Tour - a Hardcore Experience,14,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",5
Mammoth Cave,"I was expecting a lot of stories about the cave's usage and possibly some geological information. We got the safety talk on the walkway, a brief talk at the steps; then the Ranger and faster walkers left a group of about 15 in their dust. The Ranger assigned to make sure nobody got lost would answer a direct question, but didn't offer any chatting. We finally met up with the group just before tall man's agony and didn't hear anything else until near the end - where he talked about his relatives being forced to work in the cave . Either the groups are just too large, or we got a poor guide. The 500 stairs to get back to the main floor were a surprise, too. The cave walk was worth the ticket price - but it could have been a much better experience.","August 7, 2017",The Historic tour should be called a strenuous walk in the cave.,15,"Farmington Hills, Michigan",3

Mammoth Cave,"So...today we did the domes and dripstones tour $15 (each) which is excellent value for the tour and guide info you get.We were booked on a later tour but got there super early....we factored in an hours time change coming from Nashville...but the time doesn't change until a little further North (oops). It's about a 90 minute drive from Nashville. When we got there we asked if we could get on an earlier tour, which we could we just had to pay $3 (each) booking fee but that cut our wait time from a little over 2 hours to about 15 minutes.You start the tour with a 10 minute ride out to the cave entrance and then you have a quick briefing from the ranger. A short walk leads to the start of the tour...a lot of steps down, some quite narrow, although not incredibly steep I can imagine some may feel a little discomfort in negotiating them, if you can though do it...after the first dissent the rest are easy.The tour takes you through a casually paced look at the amazing cave...and is a comfortable 55-58 degrees so it really is a comfortable stroll. Towards the end there is an optional 49 steps to the drapery room...that is well worth seeing and there is plenty of time as it's at the end of the tour...and the only thing waiting is the bus back.There were a lot of people on our tour, we were at the front...but I can imagine it would be hard for you hear if your at the back...so get toward the front if you can.If your a little older, perhaps infirm or if you have small children maybe google the route first, not strenuous...but if you think you'll struggle there's not an easy way out.Well worth a visit though.","August 7, 2017",Domes and drip stones...worth every second,60,"Staffordshire, United Kingdom",5

Mammoth Cave,"We did the domes and dripstones tour. It is 2 hours, but that includes bus rides to and from the cave entrance and the visitors center. We were only underground for just over an hour. The ranger really built up how strenuous it was going to be. I was a little nervous because although I am in good shape, I do have asthma. However, I was easily able to manage this tour. Most of the stairs are going down at the beginning of the tour, and you go out a different way with fewer stairs. There are also several places where the entire groups stops to rest while the ranger talks. The one thing I didn't expect was how narrow some of the passages and staircases are. I am 5'5"" and average sized. I had to duck and walk through some of the passages sideways so I wouldn't get stuck! I would definitely recommend booking your tour in advance.

It was an o.k. tour but pretty repetitive in the formations. The best part was seeing the Frozen Niagara formation at the end of the tour. We all agreed we liked Jewel Cave in South Dakota for color and formations throughout a tour. My husband and I first went in the 1990s and there weren't as many tour options so that is a good thing.

The first day (Monday) we arrived around 10:30 and all the tours except the 3:45 were sold out. We had heard that we may have to buy tickets in advance so we bought tickets for two cave tours for the next day. We took the Historic Tour at 11:30 and the Domes and Dripstones Tour at 3:45. We brought a picnic lunch and ate lunch and just relaxed in between the tours. The Historic Tour was 2 miles long and the Domes and Dripstones Tour was 3/4 mile. They each took 2 hours. They both involved a lot of stairs into and out of the cave. We are in reasonable shape and were able to do both tours without any problems but were definitely tired at the end of the day.

During the stops along the way, you can definitely hear what is said. A few areas were low and tight but if you're able to duck or bend and maneuver walking sideways, you'll be fine.

Mammoth Cave,"The rangers do a great job telling visitors the history of the cave. They took the time to answer questions before moving on. We took the Domes and Dripstones Tour. It's not for everyone especially with physical limitations There are about 500 stairs and uphill inclines and some tight squeezes and places to bump your head. Wear proper footwear, closed toe would be the best. The cave is a constant 54 degrees, so we wore a long sleeve tee shirt and pants and were comfortable. Reservations are a must and can not be made the day of your visit! Heads up, THERE ARE NO RESTROOMS so it's best to plan ahead.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave National Park offers many different tours. Most, if not all, sell out. This came as a sad surprise for my spontaneous family. Went on a Tuesday, nearly all tours were sold out for the entire week. I've been on a lot of cave tours, this one has the oohs and ahhs of most well managed cave tours. Even though it is described as a ""moderate exertion"" tour, there were quite a few people who probably shouldn't of gone on this tour. There are a lot of stairs, mainly down, and some tight passes. I thought I'd have to perform CPR on a few of the participants who clearly don't walk much past the couch to the fridge. This is about a 2 hour tour, 3/4 mile. The cave is inactive in formation, well maintained by the park service, and the guide was informative. These are very crowded tours, 115 people were in our group.

Mammoth Cave,"This was my second trip to Cave City but first time in Mammoth Cave NP. I had previously visited Horse Cave several years ago. My wife and I brought five kids who were ready for adventure and this was the first national park we were going to visit on this years road trip that would include six other NP's. We purchased tickets for the Domes & Dripstones Tour and also Trog Tour for the kids. We got the tickets the day before and picking them up at the Visitor Center only took a few minutes standing in line. The Visitor Center has a nice museum with some interesting information and displays. There is also a small gift shop. As with most NP's the rangers were exceptional and gave us some great ideas. The kids even stayed and watched the ranger chat on animal scat which was oddly interesting. The Domes & Dripstones tour was phenomenal. I'm 6'3"" and was able to get through with some ducking here and there. Our tour probably had about fifty people and we were near the front. Somewhere behind us a woman got stuck on the stairs and had to be assisted out of the cave. Most of the group was held up for a long time because it was difficult to get around her where they were. One of the rangers stayed with her and assisted with the rescue. The section of cave we were in was beautiful and deep, although we weren't even close to the bottom. We loved the tour and would go back. There are some huge caverns and some really interesting formations on the latter half of the tour. That afternoon we had set up the Trog tour for the kids. Our five and five others were all that were allowed. The Trog tour is kids only and goes into sections of the cave that no other visitors will ever see. This was the highlight of our roadtrip on Day 2 for the kids. They talked about it the entire roadtrip. While the kids were doing their tour which lasted a few hours my wife and I got a chance to hike around the park. We hiked our first trail down to the Green River and a sinkhole and waterfall. We hiked the Cedar Sink trail as well. We picked the kids up at the Historic Entrance and got some good pictures. All in all we had a great time and would definitely come back. This was our second cave tour in a national park. We visited Wind Cave NP two years earlier.

Mammoth Cave,Was in town for work and decided to see this famous cave while I was so close. While it is really cool to go inside the longest cave system in the world it's definitely not the most beautiful. It's large and open but pretty devoid of interesting formations. The knowledgeable park rangers do great tours through it though and you can tell they are deeply passionate about the cave's history. I went on the Gothic Avenue tour and the violet city lantern tour. I probably enjoyed the lantern tour more as it was a neat experience to see the cave as they did 100 years ago. I was worried about how heavy the lantern would get on a 2hr+ trek through the cave but they are very light.

For goodness sake stay left we made a mistake and went left and a really rude ranger asked me ""what tour we were on"" we said ""discovery"" he said... Again very rudely that I needed to ""get back over there"". I said ok sorry ... There weren't any signs...to which he replied ""sir go back to the other trail or you can leave now"". Then this other ranger just shows up and says I was standing there giving directions... We had six adult people in our group and no one heard anyone saying anything. I feel that there were several opportunities in this scenario, 1, paint different colored lines on floor that reference each tour type...2) more signage, either of these would solve the issue... But rangers basically yelling at people is NOT a good choice. At least not in my opinion. The caverns are amazing but the personnel kinda put a dark cloud over the experience. I'm glad we saw it.

There are some low and tight places but there were not a problem. Our tour guide ""John"" was wonderful, wonderful. He took questions and didn't rush at all but did keep up on time. He did explain at the pre-tour meeting that this was the ""no whining"" tour and I have to say everyone including many children were real troopers. The cave doesn't compare to Carlsbad Cavern but I am very glad we did it. The ""easy"" trips book up a month in advance which is the tour we should have taken for our ability.","July 23, 2017",Beautiful Park with many things to do,13,"Garland, Texas, United States",5

Mammoth Cave,"My boyfriend and I visited this park on a day trip, but could have easily spent a week in this area. The park alone offers so much. We made the mistake of not making reservations so all the tours were booked by the time we arrived at 9:30am on a Saturday. Luckily, there had been 2 cancellations for the Historic Tour at 11:30! The historic tour was 2 hours long and took us through the Rotunda, past smoke signatures from the 1800s, through Fat Man's Misery, Tall Man's Misery, and many more points of interest within the cave. Our guide, Ranger Ginger was informative and entertaining, and you could tell she had a passion for her job. We will definitely be making a return trip to take full advantage of this park and the surrounding area. A few things I wish I had known before this trip:-Make your reservations early! The tours fill up quickly. -Bring a jacket if you're going during warmer months. The temperature inside the cave sits at around 53 degrees year-round. -There is zero cell service once you begin approaching the park. Make adjustments. -There are no restrooms within the cave. If you're going on a longer tour, do your business before hand. -There were several children on our tour, but the smaller ones seemed to get fidgety towards the end. I would choose a shorter tour for 6 and under. -Know your physical limitations. The terrain inside the cave is slick and uneven in several spots, and there were over 500 stairs on our tour.-Be respectful of your tour guide. People pay to go on these tours and learn. If you're planning on talking the entire time, please consider the self-guided tour. ","July 23, 2017",Mammoth Adventure ,7,"San Diego, California",5
Mammoth Cave,"So we drove around the park for an hour or so in the blistering heat taking in a couple of the surface trails and visiting the welcome center and Hotel for lunch while we were waiting for our first cave tour. We were wondering and evening saying aloud...what type of pork fat got this place to be a National Park...and then as we approached the historic entrance to the cave on the discovery tour we began to realize. This park is ALL underground. And until you go underground you just can't understand. The more you go, the better you understand.","July 23, 2017",Seriously you have to go underground to understand why this is a NP,22,"Atlanta, Georgia",5
Mammoth Cave,"I found the Star Chamber experience very interesting and fun with the lanterns. Going through the historic entrance, walking through the cave by only lantern light, is pretty neat. The guide tells a lot of stories, you stop a bunch, but it is awfully dark and you cannot really see much. It is a fun tour, but ONLY if you have been in the cave before with the lights on. I have been to Mammoth Cave many times,, and I had seen the huge rooms of the cave and was very familiar with the cave, so the dimly lit conditions with the lanterns were not causing me to miss anything. The Star Chamber tour did take me to a part of the cave I had never seen before, surprising because I have been here so many times. Pleasant surprise! The Grand Avenue Tour is incredible BUT VERY STRENUOUS for older people and a bit much for younger kids. I would always pair just about any other tour with the Historic Tour because you really need to go into the cave through that BIG HOLE in the ground at least once on your visit! Just to get full impact. I would allow two whole days for cave tours ... do the Historic Tour one day, then one of the other tours the next. I've done two in a day before, but I was a lot younger then.On the Grand Avenue Tour, you will see Frozen Niagara, and you will see the Snowball Room (where they used to serve food, but do not at this time). You are going to walk up some pretty steep ramps and walk down some pretty steep ramps, the floor is a little wet and slick, there are tons of stairs, the guide moves at a pretty fast clip, so not much time to catch your breath. And I thought they moved us through there a little fast for actually stopping to look at anything. There are restroom stops along the way, but you are not allowed to bring food into the cave, so eat a good breakfast before the tour.It's four hours long and the cave is chilly, but because you are walking so fast and exerting yourself, no more than a light jacket or just long sleeves are advisable. I love Mammoth Cave!! The surrounding area is more than a little junky, but the park itself is just fantastic.","July 22, 2017",Star Chamber & Grand Avenue Tours vs. Historic Tour,30,"Dearborn, Michigan",4
Mammoth Cave,"We did the Domes and Dripstones tour and it was perfect for our and our 9yo daughter. It is about a 90 minute underground hike with multiple stops to learn about the cave and its history. We had a fantastic guide (Rick). We also went back and did the self guided tour, which takes you through the large, open, almost cathedral-like areas of the cave. That section is pretty accessible once you get down a long staircase.","July 22, 2017",Perfect!,24,"Columbus, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"We took the Violet City Lantern tour. It was dark, but the guides used flashlights at times to point out specific features. It was a unique way to see the cave. We chose not to carry one of the lanterns, although it might be better to carry one since I was often blinded by the lantern of the person in front of me while I was watching the path. It was a 3-mile, 3-hour tour, with stops for stories and looking at things. The path was generally good, although there were a couple of ""roller coaster"" sections that went up steeply and then back down. Some stairs at the end, not nearly as many as I was expecting. We followed the advice we read and heard and booked about 2 months in advance. All the specialty tours were full, and this was on a Monday! We also recommend the restaurant in the resort. The bourbon pecan pie was excellent!","July 21, 2017",A Different Way to see the Cave,63,"Ellensburg, Washington",5
Mammoth Cave,"While on a road trip with my parents, we decided to check out Mammoth Cave National Park. I'm so glad we did! We did the Discover Tour and the Domes and Dripstone Tour. I'd highly recommend both. Unfortunately, people don't respect the rules that are explicitly stated by the Park and its rangers, like not taking flash photos during the tours (to avoid provoking seizures for those with epilepsy) or touching the rocks. That's not a reflection on the park, just the ignorance of people who don't respect others. The highlight was meeting Jerry Bransford who shared his family's connection to Mammoth Cave, which goes back 5 generations. If you go to the park, find Jerry to learn some of the lesser known facts about Mammoth Cave's history and its story from slavery until today.","July 21, 2017",Best way to cool off on a hot summer day,2,"Maputo, Mozambique",4
Mammoth Cave,"Another great place to stop for a nature walk. A few hours into Kentucky. Another free place to go and also pet friendly place to visit. But unless your dog are service dog or emotional support dog they are not allowed in the cave. Luckily my pups are emotional support dogs, so we were able to visit the cave with them. Had alot of stairs to start off with on your way into the cave.so they recommend that you pick your dog up if possible to start because so many people visiting the cave. Once in to the cave it's all kind of flat land so your dog can get down and walk with you. It's not light in the cave and your not allowed to use your flash on your camera to take pictures. Thier was a part of the cave that had fallen in so you could walk that but the rest of it was informational. Once back out of the cave your have many trail to walk.

Mammoth Cave,We took a two mile historical tour. Buy your tickets on line since the tours sell out fast. After you get your tickets then you go to a central meeting place to begin the tour. A long sleeve shirt will keep you warm. It was physically challenging for older people so older people should stick to the tours classified as easy. Unfortunately our tour guide was a college intern with a high voice. The louder she tried to speak the higher her voice so we couldn't actually hear her. These interns need to more closely vetted for voice projection. The history just hit the highlights. The cave itself is fascinating.

He answered questions, told very enthusiastic entertaining stories, and provided a great deal of knowledge about the cave's history. My only complaint is that the tour groups are very large. We were at the back of the group and while we were able to catch up to hear everything the guide had to say, we were unable to get any time near him during the tour to ask questions. We often times walked up to the group and he would be answering questions while they were waiting on the remaining people, and we would have enjoyed having that opportunity.

Mammoth Cave,"I have traveled to about thirty of the national parks so when I was in Louisville for a group trip we took a car load of guys to check out Mammoth Cave. I suppose if you've never been in a cave before that this would be enthralling. But it's no Luray Caverns or Carlsbad Caverns. There are several tour options which you would be well advised to make an advanced reservation for online. The tours vary in length and difficulty. You are transported to the cave by bus, receive a briefing and then begin your descent in to the cave. The footing can be slick and be sure to bring a jacket. If you are claustrophobic, this isn't for you. The tour was interesting but not overwhelming. I'm not sure that this is a park worth driving out of your way for. We did a short hike to a natural spring and down to the river as well. These are fairly easy short hikes. All in all, I'd rate the park as average and a must only if you are trying to see every park.

Mammoth Cave,"This national park is located not far off I-65 in Kentucky so it was a reasonable drive for us to take our two grandsons as a quick trip. Also we were excited to learn that the Lincoln birthplace and his childhood farm weren't too far off the interstate a little north of the park. Made for a great two night trip from western Illinois.We arrived around 5 and had an easy check in to stay on site. We went into Cave City for find food for the one vegetarian in the group and returned in time to hear the ranger talk at 7:30 pm.Spent the night and ate breakfast at the Grill. A little pricey for youngsters who only ate cereal and yogurt. We forgot to pack milk with our cereal so we ate on site.We did the 11:30 Frozen Niagara Tour which was short and very easy. Although there is some lightning and they have a solid path, there were parts where it was harder to see the ground and it was wet. In one section the floor was very uneven and I slipped and fell into a fence that protected the stalactites. I was careful on the way back. Hubby is 6'3"" and he hit his head several times. He wished he would have worn his hat. Even though they encourage you to wear a jacket, we didn't think it was that cold in this area. You have the choice to walk down the 50 steps to see the frozen Niagara grouping or you can stay at the top and wait for the group. There is good railing to hold on to to pull yourself up.It went by fast and our guide was very good with information about the cave. I keep swearing I won't go through another cave but we still find one more to see. I hope this is the last one I have to go through!The cost of the tour is very reasonable and I'm glad I went.

Mammoth Cave,"My husband & I spent two days at the park. We both found it to be well worth the trip and enjoyed the Historical and the Domes & Dripstones tours. The more visually stunning and just plain fun tour was the Domes & Dripstones, but if you're claustrophobic this one has many tight areas in the first 20-25 minutes of the tour which includes a descent of 280 steps that twists and curves through the cave shaft.Some tips:- You must order tickets in advance, if you don't you'll most likely end up with the self guided (which may be what you are looking for)- Read up on the length of tours and physical requirements. The tours we took lasted moe than two hours and each had ~500 steps. We split then up over two days.- Determine what tour is best for your kids. Especially consider if your toddler is up for a 2+ hour hike underground. Many little kids on our tour weren't and got quite crabby or bored about an hour in. For the two tours we took, I'd say kids 8 & up would be fine. It really depends on how adventurous they are.- It's 54 degrees in the cave, but I was fine without a jacket. Parts of the tour/hike are fairly strenuous and you can break a sweat.- The parking lot in front of the Visitors Center was a nightmare when we arrived around noon on a Wednesday. Super crowded and people jockeying for spots. It sucked. Save yourself the hassle and park in the overflow parking by the Lodge (turn right before the Visitor Center). Walk through the Lodge and there is a bridge that takes you right into the Center.- I had absolutely no cell phone coverage there (AT&T).I encourage you to go and be amazed, but do yourself a favor and get your tickets in advance and avoid the front parking lot.","July 17, 2017","Great experience, but plan ahead",47,St. Louis,4

Mammoth Cave,"I've been on two tours at the Mammoth Caves in the past two months. The first was a quick 1 hour tour giving an introduction to the caves and history. The second was Violet City lantern tour. A 3 hour tour immersed in total darkness except for your lanterns. Tip to those wanting to check out these tours, reservations are HIGHLY recommended. Do not expect to show up and just purchase tickets. Most of the tours are sold out in advance. My only complaint is the lack of adults only tours. Hear me out.The first tour, while short, included 4 kids and an infant. There was a diaper change and no trash to dispose of the diaper. As you can imagine walking behind a dirty diaper while taking a tour in close quarters was a bit uncomfortable. Also the constant banter children talking over the guides was distracting and we missed some key points of interest due to this.The second tour Violet City taken a month later included 7 boy scouts. I'd venture to say 2 of them had genuine interest in the caves and history. The rest were busy giggling, talking about fidget spinners, bumping into guest who were carrying hot lanterns, complaining about how long the tour was taking ( 3 hours ) and being nuisance to those who wanted to hear the guides. It was frustrating and I felt like I had wasted my money and time driving to this tour.Please consider doing a separate tour for adults only or at least an age restriction at 16+. I would gladly​ pay extra to be able to enjoy the tour without smelly diapers and children who are bored. ","July 17, 2017",Great tours. Beautiful caves. ,3,"Nashville, TN",4
Mammoth Cave,"We wanted to tour the caves but did not realize that you had to have tickets well in advance. We were able to take the discovery tour which was a self guided tour. It worked out fine as we had 2 toddlers and a 4,and 6 year old. There are guides as you enter the orginial cave to explain how the cave was used in the early 19th century, but had been discovered kong before that. the kids were able to walk down to the cave . The day was extremely hot and walking down the steps into the cave was truly refreshing as it was a constant 55 degrees in the cave. My suggestion is to get there early as the cave opens at 9:15 There were a few of us at that time and could do a leisurely walk. As we left the cave the number of people entering into it were constant. It is definitely worth it, but be aware the main cave tours are pricey.

We simply took a chance but luckily were able to buy tickets for the Historic Tour from the tour counter at the park. It was a wonderful guided tour (with ranger Chris and Chris), very informative, adventurous and just about enough time for young kids to endure. Some narrow portions may be challenging for tall and big individuals to pass, but most manage. It's called a ""fat man's misery"" while being a ""children's delight"". The cave was well-lit, but still quite wet and dark in some places to create the original effect. For us it was a great respite from the summer heat outside. After our tour, we had just about enough time to visit the museum at the Visitor Center before heading back on the road. Hopefully, we will visit again someday to see the other caves. Another additional / bonus adventure was crossing a small creek/river on the Green River ferry that carried us in our car on the way to the Mammoth caves.

Wasn't strenuous for us and was super fun. NPS checks your shoes - so be sure you have your ankle high hiking boots with good tread. Must wear shorts and a t shirt so that you can put the NPS provided Coveralls. Helmet, bandana, gloves, head lamp are all provided. This tour is not for everyone. We did a quite a bit of army crawling and there are some pretty tight squeezes. Our guide was awesome - spoke French and Mandarin! The tour group was small and intimate.

We did not make reservations so we took the self guided tour which was the only one available when we arrived. But, it was fun going down the long stairs to the cave. There are park rangers inside the caves waiting to tell you a bit of the history of the caves, so you do get some info along the way. Wear comfortable shoe that can take a little dirt. It's a hike to get to the cave entry. On the way out, they ask you to walk on a mat with soapy water to get the germs off your feet before going back to the outside.

Mammoth Cave,"Spent a week here with the family camping in tents. We went on the Historical Tour and the Frozen Niagara Tour. We visited several other caves as well - this was the coldest at 54F - which coupled with the long 2 hour tour we signed up for made for a long day with our 5 and 6 year olds. Dress accordingly and don't expect any of the gift shops to have warm clothes for young children (they really could make a killing on that...). The tour also felt like a foot race. Despite staying at the front of the group where we were told to be if we wanted to walk slow, we did not. Over two hours the tour stopped, perhaps, 4 times, only letting you casually glace around between stops as you tried to keep up with the group. Also, this cave prohibits flash photography - so don't bother with a camera of any sort.By the time we got there and realized I had signed up for the 2 hour Historic tour and not the self-guided Discovery Tour, as I had expected, everything else was sold out. Toward the end of the week a Frozen Niagara tour opened up, which shows you the only part of the cave with any formations. The rest is massive with tunnels you could drive semi-trucks through, but no formations to look at or learn about. However, know that 30 minutes of your tour time will be taken up with a bus ride to the entrance for the tour.And, whatever you do, do NOT eat at the restaurant. My wife had a simple request to leave 1 item OFF of a burger and they would NOT make any ""modifications"". It was a fried egg on a burger - which then came with runny yolk all over her burger - exactly what she was trying to avoid.Their excuse was that it is a national park and their volume just could not let them take special requests. The restaurant wasn't even half full. National chain restaurants can handle full special orders during peak hours - the only reason they cannot take special requests is because of incompetent management - period.Further, my open-faced sandwich (and included fries), which the waitress promoted and I selected, was served ice cold, despite clearly having been warm, at least, at some time due to partially melted cheese.When they sat us we were told that a potato soup was their soup for the day, which we ordered two servings of. Then 10 minutes later we were told they had switched over to a broccoli cheddar. Apparently they can make a modification when it fits their needs, but not their customers.So, eat elsewhere - call in advance because the website does NOT list all of the tour options - and be prepared for long fast tours.","July 14, 2017",Skip the website - call ahead first,2,"Toomsuba, Mississippi",4

Mammoth Cave,"My wife and I decided to visit Mammoth Cave on our way to Cincinnati. We booked the Accessible Tour as my wife's knees are giving her some grief on stairs. This tour featured no stairs and an elevator ride to the cave itself versus going down stairs. So far, so good. You follow a park vehicle to the elevator location (it's locked up tight and kind of hidden away) and then descend in 2 groups down to the cave. You find yourself in a large cavern and then go to the Snowball Room (even larger area that used to be a lunch area with picnic tables, no less) and learn about the history of the cave and the cave guides. Then you walk down the dry cave area and look at gypsum deposits on the ceiling for about a 1/4 mile. Next, you stop at a pile of rocks to hear how caves are formed. Then you stop and they light an old oil lantern and turn off all the other lights so that you can see what it looked like in the old tour days. The funny part of this tour is, with it being the Accessible tour for the folks that aren't in the best shape - there are no benches along the path to stop and rest. There were people having a really hard time standing while the rangers were talking for 10 minutes at these stops. (Carlsbad Caverns has benches all along their paths for just such folks). Next, you turn around and go back to the Snowball room and they talk about the cave some more. And then it's time to go. Up the elevator and out. 90 minutes. TADA!This tour featured no stalactites or stalagmites or any other interesting formations other than the ceiling in the Snowball room and 100+ year old graffiti. It's just a cave with lights. So, while it is accessible and it is cool down there, it's not very interesting. Better to take the self tour or find one of the easy tours and go a few steps. Or just look at pictures.

There was a terrible electrical storm the night prior & it knocked out all electricity in the section of cave for our afternoon tour. I would have liked a text telling us our choices or what to do. There was an announcement that our tour was converted to a different one but employees said differently & when I asked another ranger, he knew nothing. Our only 2 options were another tour that we had taken already that morning or a refund. I wish there had been more tour options so we got a refund.Would I go back or recommend Mammoth Cabe National Park to a friend? Yes!

Mammoth Cave,"Highly recommend getting your tickets at least a week ahead of time, there were plenty of options when we bought ours, but all tours were sold out while we were there. We did the historic tour with our kids, found it to be a great introduction the history and significance of the cave. The historic tour takes 2 hours, but was not a challenge for our kids (10 and up), the roughest part for me was actually the combo of Fat Man's Misery and Tall Man's Agony, as I am a former football lineman, but never felt claustrophobic or uncomfortable.","July 11, 2017",Great experience for the family.,1,,5

VERY disappointed, Guess with it being a government department can't expect people to do their jobs and keeps things updated. Spent $5.00 and did the self tour. I would call and make sure your tour you want to go on still exists before traveling to the park. The $5.00 tour was ok.

Mammoth Cave,Beautiful park. Very informative area inside plus the tours are inexpensive compared to other caves. We did the discovery tour for $5 a person and walked through a portion of the cave ourselves. Couldn't beat it! We saw the Historic entrance and then walked around some trails near the Green river afterwards. The paths are nicely maintained. We will be back with our kids when they're a little older and able to walk around more without getting tired. ,"July 11, 2017",Great park for hiking/walking/ learning ,5,,4

Try some of the hiking trails (remember bug spray!!!) to see some of the Green River and different springs from the cave rivers. The cave itself is cold so plan accordingly for your own comfort (about 55 degrees year round). There are lots of stairs, low ceilings, dark places and echoing rooms - please, please, please be honest with yourself about your personal limitations. A few of our tours were almost ruined because of obnoxious people talking too much or with too many physical limitations for the tours they were on. Read tour descriptions carefully. The museum in the visitor's center was very interesting and informative. There was a lot to take in and see.

Mammoth Cave,We went on a Saturday and it was ridiculously busy. Even with tickets purchased online (which you have to do to guarantee a tour) you have to wait in a super long line for printed tickets. The power abs phones were out in the cave section we were to tour so we were rebooked to the historical tour. We ended up not being able to complete our tour because of an issue with our baby ten minutes into the cave. The guide was very accommodating and walked us out. ,"July 9, 2017",Busy busy!!,94,"Athens, Ohio",3
Mammoth Cave,"We ordered the Domes and Dripstones tour the night before per other viewers' recommendations. You definitely need to order in the morning of the day before... because by the time I looked in the evening, tickets were almost sold out. Only a few tickets were left. The day we toured, lighting for the D&D were not working. They moved us to the History Tour 15 minutes later The History tour was nice... The caves were magnificent. Our tour guide was very good. She kept a large group of at least 120 people organized and orderly. We did not have problems hearing her.... although our group was in the front most of the time. Lots of steps up and down the caves. Not everyone is fit to take this tour. Also, there are some tight spaces, not everyone can fit through. It was worth the money. Everyone in our group enjoyed it. I would give it a 5 star. But since the waiting around due to the lighting problems, I took one star off as it seemed a little disorganized there. By the way, show up at least 45 mins early to get your tics (even if you ordered online.) There's a long line of everyone picking up their tics. This process should be improved. NOW - the strangest thing happened when we were in front of the giant COFFIN rock! My phone died!!! I was able to take a couple of pictures before that happend.. then the phone died on it's own.

So, we chose the Domes & Dripstones for which the staff member convinced me it was moderately physical. This tour should be emphasized that it is for physically fit people who can climb & maneuver in tight spots. It was very hard on me since I am not fit.

Mammoth Cave,We visited Mammoth Cave Memorial Day weekend. We participated in the Domes and Dripstones Tour. I think the tour would have been more enjoyable if they cut the tour numbers in half. There were at least 60 people on the tour. The park ranger kept telling people to make sure there were no gaps and for the slow people to go in front. I kind of felt like I was being yelled at. When you have a group of 60 people and numerous stairs and things to look at you will have gaps. During the 2 hour tour we only stopped and talked about the cave twice. This tour was not enjoyable at all. This whole tour was a disappointment. I was a tour guide in a cave for 7 years and this was the worst tour I had ever been on. I will not be in a hurry to return here.,"July 8, 2017",Cave Tour,5,"Dayton, Ohio",2
Mammoth Cave,"We ended up needing to visit Mammoth Cave on two different days because our original tour choice, Domes and Dripstones was completely sold out by the time we got there. In fact, all guided tours were sold out. The first day, we did the self-guided tour, entitled ""The Discovery Tour."" It was so so. I mean, you do get to enter a cave and it was interesting in its own way; however, it displayed none of the cool features you would expect of such a renown cave.Our second day (unplanned previously), we showed up for our pre-booked Domes and Dripstone tour. It was more of what we expected to see of Mammoth Cave. We took a short, 10-min bus ride to the entrance of our tour. It was beautiful! This tour also includes the Frozen Niagara viewing. Of course, this is a must see. Not only is it located in a beautiful state park but it is also listed as one of Discovery's North America's Top 10 Natural Wonders and is the largest cave system known in the world (over 400 miles long explored so far!!).","July 8, 2017",Book your tours online ahead of time!!,33,"Montgomery, Alabama",4
Mammoth Cave,"We wanted to do the Grand Avenue tour, but this was sold out so instead we booked three tours which we did on the same day: The Historic Tour, Gothic Avenue, and Frozen Niagara. All are 2 hours each. We had Ethan as our tour guide for the Niagara and Gothic tours, and he was brilliant. Very funny and informative. We had another guide for the Historic tour who was not so good, but by no means bad. The Historic tour went through the most interesting part of the cave, going through the 'Fat Man's Misery', up many stairs, and through places you have to squeeze through and duck under. The Gothic Avenue was not as challenging but still very interesting, and the Frozen Niagara tour allowed us to go to the other side of the cave and see a different, man-made entrance. The natural entrance (used for Historic and Gothic tours) is beautiful, but also quite cold - I recommend you bring a sweater or light jacket. I loved all three tours.All the rangers in the visitor's center were extremely friendly and helpful.","July 8, 2017",Amazing! Did 3 tours in one day,8,"London, United Kingdom",5
Mammoth Cave,"We booked the Historic Tour since it was the only one left for the day and time we could go (book well in advance, especially in the summer), and we weren't all that impressed. The cave itself was awesome (though only some ""rock flow"" and ""draperies"" as opposed to, say, stalactites and stalagmites), but the tour wasn't as cool as we were hoping it would be. First off, there were around 100 people in our group. This may be fine for some tours, but not a cave tour, where there are only a few places large enough for everyone to gather around and listen to the ranger--which brings me to my second complaint: I was expecting to hear more history (about anything, really: the cave itself, the area surrounding the cave, anything, I just like learning things), but either we were too far in the back of the group (see preceding note about the number of people in our group), or the ranger just didn't stop more than twice to tell the group anything. My third complaint: I understand this should be open to kids, and I'm fine with that, but when they're misbehaving during the mini-lecture before the group even enters the cave--the lecture the ranger gives specifically emphasizing things like ""children should stay with their parents at all times and not misbehave""--it's not a good sign. I suppose the park can't deny entry to paying guests, but perhaps the rangers can enforce the rules a little more once the group is in the cave. Kids running amok and being obnoxious isn't good for the people who are trying to listen and learn from the ranger. I really didn't want to give such a low rating to such an awesome piece of nature, but I had to because of the way it's set up (that you have to go on tours if you want to actually see a lot of the cave, and that at least the Historic Tour had an insane number of people). I've been to other caves in the States--and in other countries--and sadly, this one sort of disappointed me. If they can make the tour groups smaller, I think that would help tremendously.","July 7, 2017","Awesome cave, so-so tour",487,"Los Angeles, California",3
Mammoth Cave,"What an amazing way to spend part of your summer vacation at Mammoth Cave. This National Park is one that is not visited as much as those out west. To think that you can get to this phenomenal national park via Interstate 65 within 3 to 5 hours from many large cities is a must. What you decide to do in the park should be decided way before you arrive because if you have not visited the cave tour site you might just be seeing the treetops instead of the below sites. Many tours are sold out even before you arrive. This is a MUST DO several days before you start your drive to the park. Mammoth Cave does not charge an entry fee upon driving into the park. Fees are only charged via the cave tour you select. The National Parks deserve to be praised for what they do for those who love nature. Several suggestions to take into consideration. I'd recommend taking two tours while visiting Mammoth Cave. The first one should be Domes and Dripstones. On this tour you will see many cave formations inside the cave especially the last hour you are inside. This hike is only 3/4 of a mile and time passes by quickly. Stay up with the lead ranger because he explains many things to you as you walk along. If you are a slow walker you miss out on all the tales about the caves past. Be prepared to see many stalagmites, stalactites, popcorn, and column growths. They save these for the past hour so hang in there because the entire tour itself is wonderful.The historic tour is also one not to miss. You are told many facts about the cave from the 1820's and current exploration happenings. Once agin don't linger in the back because you will miss out on what the ranger says while you walk. Eventually when you get to the sitting areas then everyone hears what his normal speech is about.The ranger allows time for questions which in most groups you will have various questions asked. They are on a two hour time limit so there is not much down time. On this tour you will walk two miles from the start of the visitors center to the cave entrance and then return the same way. If it should be raining and lightening after you tour you will not be let out of the cave until it is safe.Remember to bring a WARM JACKET OR SWEATSHIRT to wear inside the cave, The cave temperature is 54 degrees. If you are one to be cold then wear long pants. You will not get dirty on either of these hikes. Nor will you see any bats. Lastly, DO NOT FORGET TO BRING A small FLASHLIGHT. The cave trails are lit but, there were times you questioned where you should step next. If you have children who are 12 and under make sure they particiapate in the Junior Ranger Program. The activities that the kids get to do and the booklet that they work on keep them busy way after your visit to the park.If you are fortunate to meet Jerry Bransford, one of the senior park rangers while visiting, consider yourself lucky. Jerry is a fith generation tour guide at Mammoth Cave. His great-great grandfather is one of the tour guides who worked back in the 1850's. Materson Bransford's full size image can be seen as you enter the Visitors Center along with many of the other earlier tour gides back in the late 1800's. We met Jerry while participating in a kid's program at 4pm in the Visitor's Center. Jerry was the one taking us along on a scavenger hunt outside looking for certain nature things above ground. We purchased a book that was written about his family's history who lived in this area way back when for $4.95. Plus Jerry also autographed the book for us for our keepsake.

Mammoth Cave,"Recently visited Mammoth Caves with my brother, his teen daughter, and my teen son. We stopped while traveling further south, so we arrived later in the day. We made the mistake of not reserving a tour so the only tour that was not sold out when we arrived was the self-guided discovery tour. As I had previously visited Mammoth Caves as a teenager, I was a little underwhelmed by this tour. However, when I had visited before, we had done either the Dripstones tour or the Historic tour (I don't remember which). There is a nice museum inside the visitor center. One of the rangers we spoke with in the visitor's center was a little prickly when asked to recommend a tour (before they all sold out in the blink of an eye), but every other ranger we spoke with was very friendly and knowledgeable. I highly recommend this park and I highly recommend reserving spots on one of the more involved tours before your visit.","July 7, 2017",Nice Park for All Ages,23,"Youngstown, Ohio",4
Mammoth Cave,"Let me start by saying---you need to make reservations early because if you don't, you won't be able to reserve a tour. We didn't book a tour ahead of time, and the only tour we could do is the Discovery Tour. For my boys, who don't really like tours , it was perfect. It's basically a self-guided tour that takes about 40 minutes to complete. It's an introductory tour as stated on the website, but it gives a good overview of the caves. Later on in the evening, we went back to the caves for a short trail walk. No crowds, and you basically have the entire place to yourself. We walked back to the cave entrance, and they have some trails right by the caves. The temperature difference between the entrance to the caves and the normal daytime temp is quite surprising. There is this blast of cool air that surrounds the cave. My 8 year old was pretty tired, so we didn't go very far, but it would have been a great experience, I'm sure!

My wife and I did the Historic cave tour and domes /drips tour. Both unique. Cave tours appear to be very well organized. While on a tour, I recommend positioning yourself up front, near the tour guide, as you will hear so much more of their presentation. I can easily see families with young kids wanting to take on some of the more difficult and challenging cave tours. We love to hike and took in several hikes; most are short (under 2 miles) and easy, but we enjoyed them.

It is a very easy walk and good for families with children or older persons. If you plan to visit, book a tour ahead if you really want to see the cave.

Mammoth Cave,"We really enjoyed our visit to Mammoth. My husband and I took our girls, 11 and 14, for a one-day visit. We pre-booked two hikes, the historic tour and Domes tour. While we thoroughly enjoyed them, I have to say we were pretty tuckered out by the end, especially my husband and I. We're not totally out of shape, but these hikes had my legs ready to give by the end. There are a LOT of stairs in both hikes. In most cases, the stairs weren't broken up into little chunks here and there. There were a few times you had to climb up steep and narrow cases the wound straight up a chute with several hundred steps. There were the occasional landings where someone could step to the side to catch their breath though. Neither of these hikes may be good for anyone who has a fear of heights. There are a few spots where you can see well below you and when you're climbing the stairs (though then it's mostly dark beyond the steps so you can't see beyond it too much so it may not be too bad. It is moist most everywhere, so it can be a little slippery. Be sure to wear sneakers or hiking sandals with good tread. If you bring a back pack, i don't recommend filling it too much as there are some very tight squeezes. It is pretty chilly, so a light sweater might be a good idea. The historic tour had one restroom half way through (though they don't really wait for you so you'll have to catch up). The domes tour does not have a restroom. If you want water, bring it with you.Tours are definitely fun though. Don't come expecting the kinds of caves with lots of stalactites/stalagmites, etc. You get a little here and there on some of the tours, but the caves are mostly limestone erosion. Still very impressive to see though and to hear the history of how the caves were used/explored.I HIGHLY recommend going through the visitor center's museum before cave tours. It is very informative and quite extensive with a great video. I'd say give yourself at LEAST 30 minutes to go through it.Outside of cave tours, we didn't do too much more in the park. We did take one drive along a road (can't remember the name) that headed back toward a ferry. It was a very peaceful and beautiful drive. We saw some deer and owls. There is a picnic area at the end with one port a potty. The river was pretty here, very shady and cool. Gift shops were very nice. If you go to the hotel, there's a nice restaurant with very reasonable prices...we had lunch there. There's also a little ""cafe"" that's even cheaper with sandwiches and hot dogs, ice cream, etc. I liked the restaurant better though. The hotel also has a nice gift shop.Oh! Be aware that while you can take cameras into the caves and take pictures, you can NOT use flash.","July 3, 2017","Great family trip, but LOTS of walking and climbing!!",71,Las Vegas,5

A lot of the tours seem to be a long distance, and a lot of stairs, but don't let that discourage you. The group moves really slowly so it isn't as bad as it looks. Small kids may get bored on some of the longer tours. As for which tours to do, check the descriptions carefully but I think they are all good. It was nice to do two different ones. We did Domes and Dripstones and the Historic tour which showed us two different sides of the cave. If you are afraid of heights or close quarters pick the shorter tours. The historic tour had a section that was about 5 x 2 feet that you had to crawl through for 15 minutes (which is really fun actually). Two pieces of advice, make reservations, and wear shoes with traction.I only gave it a 4 out of 5 because there wasn't much else to do outside of the caves.

We actually staid on site in one of the little cabins which was low cost and a great way to experience the park.

For a first visit, it was a great introduction and I enjoyed descending over 300 feet below the surface with my boyfriend. A relatively easy 2 hour walk but they do warn about the flights of ascending stairs and tight spaces for larger people. It's an ambient 54 degrees so glad I dressed in pants and had a light jacket. Yet even those in t shirts and shorts seemed comfortable. Wasn't interested in a second tour, but would book ahead next time for Rosen Niagara.

Mammoth Cave,We have a goal of visiting all the NP's in the country and Mammoth was next on the list. We pre-purchased tickets for 2 cave tours. We booked the tours that we felt were doable with a slight touch of claustrophobia - The Historic Tour and The Frozen Niagara Tour. The tour guid for the Historic Tour talked 3 of the 4 of us out of entering. We switched our tickets to the Self Guided Discovery Tour - with a penalty of $3/ticket. Our 4th traveler did the tour and assured us that the tour guide had WAY OVER STATED the tight quarters. When we questioned him - his response was that he was glad he had discouraged us because he gets tired of people not being able to complete the tour. We suggested an improvement might be to have a simulated section to show travelers the height and width of the Fat Mans Misery and The Tall Mans Misery....his only response was to complain about budget cuts. We enjoyed the Discovery Tour and the Frozen Niagara Tour but were disappointed we missed out on the Historic Tour. For dedicated NP travelers - this was the first time ever that we have been upset by a park ranger. Perhaps it is because these park rangers appear to all be retired teachers from the local area....not really dedicated NP employees.,"June 25, 2017",Be wary of false descriptions from the tour guides,28,"Sunset, SC",3
Mammoth Cave,"We planned our trip to Kentucky just to visit this cave. We spent two nights in the area, and we did two separate cave tours (Star Chamber Lantern, and Grand Ave) both were great. I do think the area could have justified one more night so we could explore the river and hikes further.This is very much worth a visit, even if you can just do one of the basic tours I think it would be great. We stayed at the hotel on site in one of the woodland cottages which was also a very convenient location.","June 24, 2017",Worth seeing,317,Washington DC,5
Mammoth Cave,The tours of the caves are many . They run from high adventure to walking above the ground on your own. During busy times of the year the tours do sell out so make your plans ahead online. My kids loved squeezing through narrow passage ways underground .

Mammoth Cave,"We had about a half of a day to spend at Mammoth Cave National Park. We planned our tours and made our reservations from home before leaving on our trip which is the best way to get desired tour times. Even though we had reservations, we still had to get in a fairly long line at the Visitor Center to get our actual tickets. The Visitor Center was nice and the restrooms were decent. Our 10:00 tour was the Historic tour. A park ranger told me that the Visitor Center was actually located over the cave that we would enter. The tour was a bit more challenging than I had envisioned because of the narrow area (Fat Man's Misery) which required some bending and twisting. The tour lasted for 2 hours. Our second tour was the Domes and Dripstones tour at 12:45. We had to ride a shuttle through the park to get to the cave entrance. On the way we saw wildlife such as deer and turkeys.This tour also lasted 2 hours but was actually more picturesque than the Historic tour. I found it to be easier despite the many (over 900) steps. I will admit that my legs did hurt the next day from all of the steps. A ranger told us that these 2 tours are probably the best two tours in which to experience the caves.","June 23, 2017",Caves!,148,Pittsburgh,5
Mammoth Cave,"We were driving by Mammoth to Louisville and could not get reservations for a tour, they were all sold out. We thought we would just stop in and check it out. We were glad we did. While ALL the tours were completely sold out, we were able to do the Self-Guided Tour. Only $20 for our family of 4. It was through the historic entrance and was about a half-mile long. We got to see some of the cave although not the best parts..Oh well, we know we want to go back now.","June 23, 2017",Awesome Experience even thought it was only a few minutes long,23,"Birmingham, Alabama, United States",5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth cave was unlike any cave I've seen. It's a dry cave so there are not many formations, but the size and scope of the rooms are amazing. Well worth the visit. Took the ""Domes and Dripstones"" and ""Historic"" Tours. Glad we took the tours in that order because the ""Historic"" tour was far more interesting and diverse. We would have been disappointed with the ""Domes and Dripstones"" if we took it second. To get a good overview of the cave, I'd recommend the ""Frozen Niagara (best part of ""Domes and Dripstones"") followed by the ""Historic."" Be sure to do the 49 optional steps up and down to see Frozen Niagara. Most tours are labeled moderately difficult and they are. Tours have lots and lots of stairs and many tight places. Tall people do need to watch out for low ceilings! ","June 23, 2017",A Mammoth Cave,6,"Elmhurst, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"We only had one day to visit but had a great time. Every part of this park was beautiful! We saw deer and turkey and one turkey had babies with her. We saw creepy crawly bugs and frogs. This was our first cave visit and we had ranger Jim Jarvis was great. He really impressed me when before going into the cave he asked if there were any service men or woman with our group and had us honor them before going in. He had a great sense of humor and told us to feel free to ask questions at any time. He took time with everyone's questions and let the parents know that brought young children that he was happy to have them on the tour making memories and that children are a blessing. He's a great guide! We went on the frozen Niagara tour and that was just enough for me. As much as I'd love to be adventurous, I'm a chicken lol so this tour was just enough adventure. We also hiked down one of the trails and wasn't thinking, we didn't bring water and it was hot! It was also a downhill hike to the green river so on the way back was rough but still a great time.

Mammoth Cave,"While staying at this beautiful park we did two of the cave tours offered, the Historic and the Domes and Drip Stones. The Historic tour really gives a sense of the scale of the cave with most of the tour being in large rooms and passageways. If you are looking for what is most different about mammoth cave this is the tour for you. There is one area where you have to stoop over to get through but it is only for a second, although the maneuver may be tricky for those with bad backs or necks. Also the majority of the tour is no worries for ppl with a fear of heights but there is a tower of stairs at similarly to a fire tower at the end to get back out. Many people with agoraphobia as opposed to true acrophobia have no problem with the stairs as they are in a dark place with lots of handrails (no way to fall and no sense of a large open space). This tour features very little in the way of flowstone and traditional cave decoration, but it does go in the natural entrance.Domes and Dripstones goes through a man made entrance and (a different) man made exit. These existed from an old commercial cave tour taken over by the park and were not made by the park (important for cave conservationists that may frown on blasting into a cave). This tour descends a lot of stairs through narrow domes in the cave an interesting way to see how vertical a cave system can be. There is immediately more evidence of cave decoration (natural, like stalagmites and stalactites). The tour winds through a shorter section of cave than the historic and there aren't large grand rooms, but the domes and pits and large cave decoration at the end make this a worthwhile tour. I think people with a fear of heights may fare worse on this tour but still no place are you faced with an abyss of open space, just walking on bridges over large pits and down stairs. Which is better? What interests you about mammoth? Scale or cave decorations? Both are good and doing both is the best option. I found Domes to be less of a physical challenge (neither are bad but there was definitely more ""going up"" on historic).It is sad that white nose (a disease that affects bats, not humans) is here. Please don't bring anything in the cave that you will want to use again in another cave. They are using some preventive measures to keep it from spreading but best just to isolate the clothing and packs you take to not accidentally bring it to another cave.

Mammoth Cave,"This particular tour at Mammoth Cave is about 2 miles in length and takes about 2 hours to complete. Although one can reserve spots, you could take a chance to see if any available spots are available on the tour. This tour at this time costs $14.00 for adults. Starting at the natural entrance of the cave, the tour proceeds through a number of sections, most easily accessible for most individuals with decent mobility and is accessible for children; although, it is best for children capable of walking at least two miles. During the tour, one must be able to ascend or descend a number of steps, the most difficult being towards the end of the tour when a 150 step staircase must be ascended to bring you up to the main level of the cave. Two slightly challenging areas are the “fat man’s misery” and the “tall man’s misery” the first a section of the cave where the lower portion of the trail where your legs are is about 15 inches or so wide while the top portion is much wider. For most people it is required to go through sideways. Almost immediately after this section, one must essentially walk while lowering one’s body several inches to walk through a short span that is not very tall.In some ways, this tour provides a good overview of various groups that used the cave, including Native Americans, Slaves, and others. It also goes through the section where saltpeter was mined to provide an ingredient for gunpowder production. If you are interested in cave features such as stalagmites or stalactites, etc. - this is not a good tour to go on. As one would be hard pressed to see any type of cave formations. This section of the cave is primarily dry, although it is quite large. Furthermore, since most tours in Mammoth Cave do not permit the use of flash photography, this particular tour does not provide a lot of light for taking photos; although one can always try.Although it was an interesting tour through part of the 400 plus miles of caves, I actually preferred the Frozen Niagara tour that I took on a previous trip, since at least some variety of cave forms can be found on that tour. If interested in just going through Mammoth Cave, this tour provides an opportunity to do that; although it will require about 2 hours to complete.Park Rangers serve as guides for the tour, ours was Ranger Luke who presented the material and one other ranger who’s name I can’t recollect, also was available during the tour. He was at the back of the group to ensure that everyone stayed together on the tour. The Rangers were more than willing to answer questions about the cave.","June 20, 2017",A different type of cave,80,"Salisbury, North Carolina",3
Mammoth Cave,This is our families second time at the caves we love them ... I tried to book online to reserve a tour ( which do sell out fast) I found it very hard to find descriptions of the different caves tours so Im going to post a picture of what they had at the ranger station I suggest reading each one before deciding also suggest making a 1st and 2 nd choice the park dosent run all tours at one time. Also look at the rating on the caves as far as easy moderate and difficult..... caves are very cool and its a big system so there are several different tours also there are. Primitive cabins close to Caves and there are camping spots suggest booking ahead they are always full. Also on site is a small hotel nothing fancy but if your passing through it will do has a small restaurant and snack& grill place ...

Mammoth Cave,"We completed 4 Mammoth Cave tours!1. 3 hour, 3 mile Violet City Lantern Tour – It was OK…problem was that you really couldn’t see much of the cave because of the lantern lighting. You spent most of your time looking down at the uneven pathway to make sure of your footing. You did, however, get the perspective the early cave explorers experienced, which was the whole point of this tour.2. 2 hour, 1.5 mile Gothic Avenue Tour – Along these cave passages, hundreds of candle-smoked signatures from the 1800s could be seen. Early guides earned extra “tip” money by writing visitors’ names on the cave ceiling and walls.3. 4 hour, 4 mile Grand Avenue Tour – This tour has the potential to be a fantastic tour, but unfortunately, the tour guides are on such a tight agenda, we were rushed through the cave passageways to stay on schedule. We would have loved to wander and look at leisure, but that was not to be. The majority of Mammoth Cave is a “dry” cave, but near the end of the passages on this particular tour, the limestone cap has worn away in this area, so water is able to seep through the next layer (sandstone) to form stalactites and stalagmites within the cave. 4. 2 hour, 2 mile Historic Tour – This was the one we enjoyed the most, as it seemed to be at a more leisurely pace. We were able to ascend and descend to 4 different levels of Mammoth Cave, a 300-foot change in elevation. We squeezed through the narrowest of passages (Fat Man’s Misery) and climbed up the Mammoth Dome Tower.Having finished these four tours, we have seen all the visitor accessible areas of Mammoth Cave, as these tours include all of the shorter tours.

Our guide for our first tour wasn't that great (stumbled over her words and wasn't able to answer a lot of questions), but it didn't really matter because the cave was so awesome. The Historical tour definitely has some very tight squeezes toward the end, so if you are a bit claustrophobic you might not want to do that one. The Domes and Dripstones tour was a nice balance because it showed us an entirely different part of the cave with lots of cool limestone formations. Both tours involve plenty of walking and stairs. It can also get pretty cold down there, so I'd recommend bringing a sweater or jacket with you. I'd say this was one of the coolest things I've ever done, and I would definitely do it again!","June 16, 2017",Awesome natural wonder!,2,"Syracuse, New York",4

All in all a nice ride. We then took the 4 hour grand tour. This was fairly strenuous and a few in our group were unable to make the entire journey. The sites that we saw were really amazing.

At the hotel the night before, the online reservation was showing that all tours were sold out. Disappointed, but we decided to get there early morning and see if anything was available. It turned out all tours were still available. I had taken a long tour years ago, one that went through the ""Avenue"" I think, and remembered that there were few formations, so we decided on Frozen Niagara tour. After the tour, we drove around the park some, rode the Green River Ferry, and had a quick lunch at the cafe in the hotel.

In one afternoon, he was able to do both the Domes and Dripstones Tour (2 hours) and the Cleaveland Avenue Tour (2.5 hours). We camped overnight in the park's campground which was very peaceful. Nice sized campsites. While he toured, I took a nap at our site in an almost empty campground. The next morning, while I slept in, Jeff walked back to the Visitors' Center and got tickets for the Great Onyx Lantern Tour. He viewed the exhibits in the museum which he said were excellent. Near the Visitors' Center, there is a hotel (pretty much '60s style, nothing fancy) with a comfortable lobby, big souvenir shop, and a basic restaurant.

The cave is fascinating. Much variety of cave formations on this tour. Mammoth does not have lots of stalactites and stalagmites, but still lots of interest. You walk at a pretty fast pace. Several stops where the ranger gives a talk. The biggest drawback of the tour is that it is too many people -- 78 on a full tour and ours was full. So unless you stay right at the front of the crowd, you cannot hear the ranger as he walks -- you only hear his presentations at the stops.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave, the world’s longest cave system (405 miles of interconnected caves stacked up like a pile of spaghetti), is a unique geological feature that’s well worth a visit.For most people, however, it’s not worth spending much time seeing. Except for a few sections, it’s a dry cave, with none of the stalactites, stalagmites, and other beautiful and awesome features of wet caves; the few wet sections are not nearly as spectacular as almost any of the wet caves that dot the country. Walking through is like seeing vehicular or subway tunnels after they’ve been blasted out but before they’ve been tiled and festooned with technological paraphernalia—lots and lots of bare, uniformly dull rock and rubble. I’m sure people strongly interested in caves can appreciate the subtle differences as they walk through, but most casual tourists cannot.So by all means visit, but unless you’re a cave enthusiast (or like hiking, as explained below), sign up for just one short tour. I accompanied my wife on the Accessible Tour , a one-mile easy walk primarily for people who have trouble walking. As it turned out, that was the only tour I needed.The longest tour available—the four-mile, four-hour Grand Avenue Tour—is for both enthusiasts and serious walkers who want the experience of hiking underground. It’s hard to believe there could be long, steep hills—some with switchback trails—and high staircases in a cave, but there are climbs aplenty on this tour. If you’re young, even pre-adolescent, and healthy, or an older adult in good shape with hiking experience, this is fun. But if you’re elderly or otherwise physically compromised, consider the challenges carefully.I’m 77 years old, so as much as I hate to admit it, I’m elderly. However, I’m in good shape because I walk, swim, and exercise in a gym almost every day and watch my weight. Another “however:” I have two artificial knees and an artificial hip; I take a beta blocker for high blood pressure; and I’m 6’3” in walking shoes. All these factors worked against me on this tour. I got through it without disrupting or slowing down the tour group, but didn’t enjoy it, and knowing what I know now, realize I shouldn’t have done it.I didn’t know how treacherous the footing is for someone whose sense of balance is poor. Age and artificial joints have compromised my sense of balance to the extent that I often wobble and stumble even on level ground, although I’ve never fallen. The floor of the cave is uneven, with frequent tilts up or down or side to side, sudden rises and falls, slippery spots, and occasional depressions and rocks. I had to watch my step carefully—but this was difficult because of the dim, uneven lighting that made it hard to see the path or my feet, compounded by old eyes no longer able to see well in low light. And the brisk pace, which meant the hazards kept popping up quickly with little time to react. I often stumbled, once windmilling my arms and almost going down.The Park Service warns that this hike is strenuous, but I thought they were exaggerating to scare off unfit people. They weren’t. The hike doesn’t require athletic ability, but it is demanding for compromised people. My beta blocker wouldn’t let my heart rate keep up with the taxing hills, so I became exhausted before reaching the tops. I only had to stop once, but I slowed down and fell back some. (I found a good strategy was to stay near the front of the large group—78 people—on the flat, so although I lost ground on the hills, I didn’t fall behind.)Like the floor, the ceiling is also uneven and hard to see, which became a problem in low passages where I had to duck. My height became a liability, and I bumped my head several times. Only about 100 yards from the cave exit, I didn’t realize the ceiling dipped slightly toward the end of a low passage. I scraped my scalp badly, causing a torrent of blood, although it turned out to be a superficial wound.if you’re physically able, go for it—I would. If in doubt, think long and hard.","June 7, 2017",What I Wish I Had Known,117,"Midlothian, Virginia",4
Mammoth Cave,"I visited this site two times this past weekend. I had been to a Highland Games in Glasgow KY and needed to see some sites in the area other than men running around in kilts. My first visit to the cave included the ""historic"" tour, one of several offered visitors. The tour was quite good and the guide (a 5th generation guide of the cave) was entertaining and although we had a large group was easily heard as we made stops along the passage. The focus of the history apparently was more related to slavery and the contribution of African Americans to the cave than anything else, so I was a bit disappointed from a historian's standpoint, but the tour is definitely worth the price of admission. The second tour I took was the ""Domes and Dripstones' tour. This tour was along some winding and narrow passages of the cave and entry was via an almost vertical shaft of a sinkhole and is the park's newest entry into the cave system. It should be noted that if you have problems with your legs, are afraid of heights and slick footing you will probably NOT want to take this tour. As you enter the cave you take a series of flights of stairs to the lower portion of the passage some 200 feet down. For me this stair system was nothing short of an engineering and construction marvel given it snakes down through the natural structure of the cave. The guides were good and friendly, but were a bit shaky on their knowledge of cave structure. Training was needed here and that will come as the season progresses. Ate lunch at the hotel restaurant and service was okay and food was okay as well. The buildings (visitor center and hotel) are very nice and well maintained. The clerks at the tour purchase counter were helpful and friendly in spite of a rather large crowd the days I was there. Food in the campground store was so high it was a joke. A loaf of bread, a small package of sandwich meat and American cheese slices was a little over $13.00. Typical tourist trap and a surprise since this is one of America's prime parks.","June 5, 2017","Wonderful cave and beautiful woods surrounding it, but.",99,Tennessee,3

Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I just got back from a perfect weekend camping at Mammoth Cave National Park. We were fortunate enough to have good weather, and had a great time. We took the Discovery Tour (only $7!) and primitive camped at the Mammoth Cave Campground (only $20!). Everybody that we encountered was extremely friendly - staff and visitors. And the entire park (even the campground bathrooms) were really well maintained. This was a perfect getaway for us, as it's only an hour and a half drive from Nashville.

Tours sell out quickly--purchase before you travel to make sure you can get a tour. We took an easy 1 hour tour without a lot of steps. Our guide was funny & informative. We took a bus to another entrance, had the tour & then took the bus back. We later explored the original entrance on our own. Bring a sweater, inside the cave is chilly. There's plenty of camping & hiking opportunities.","June 4, 2017",World's Longest Cave,57,"Summit, New Jersey",4
Mammoth Cave,"We hiked the park a bit to see the ""Green"" River, which was actually brown (lots of rain in preceding days). We saw the historic cave entrance on our way to the river (it's in the TripAdvisor picture above). If you are hot, this is the place to cool off. It's like nature's air conditioning down there! Now on to the Mammoth Cave tour. We did the Grand Avenue tour, which encompasses several tours into one. That being said this was an EXTREMELY STRENUOUS tour that involves 4 miles and 4 hours up and down stairs, through narrow passages, and up and down hilly areas where you need to use the railings to pull yourself along. If you are not in decent shape, don't do this tour. There were stops along the way where the tour guides spoke to us and told us stories and educated us on the cave. There were also 2 bathroom stops along the way and water fountains. Don't take a big bag or lug stuff with you on this tour. You will regret it. Take water, your camera and yourself. Wonderful guides who truly love what they do and are clearly champions of the national park system. Thank you!","June 3, 2017","Beautiful park, enormous cave system",91,"Aurora, Colorado",5
Mammoth Cave,"We visit as many National Parks as we can when we're traveling. This park area is full of opportunities for hiking, camping, biking, canoeing or kayaking, etc., but of course the main attraction is the tours of the cave itself. When we approached the ticketing area, a Ranger suggested we take the next scheduled tour, of which he would be the leader. Sure! We did not really explore the tour options, to my eventual dismay. The ""Historic Tour"" lasts two hours (includes a short bus ride to and from the start/end point). We started down a series of wet metal steps, more steps, and more steps, punctuated at times with rock pathways, also wet, and all in dim light. The tour has 440 stairs and an elevation (downward) of 300'. I admit I'm far from a sportsy person, and I also run out of breath on exertion. I had to stop several times to catch my breath and also felt disoriented and shaky from the dim conditions and feeling unsteady on the wet stone ground surfaces, not to mention bowing your head to get through low passageways and squeezing through narrow ones. All I could concentrate on was the next step in front of me, and I took a grand total of ONE photo during the whole time, where usually over that time period, I would take 100's. One young gentleman in front of us did in fact faint. I was just glad (and surprised) it wasn't me. Overall, BE CAREFUL and consider your limitations when you select a tour. Looks like there are 3 ""easy"" ones, 3 ""moderate"" ones (ours), and one ""very strenuous"" (spelunking). What wound up annoying me most was toward the end, when we got to the most lauded area of this tour, Mammoth Dome, it wasn't even all that wonderful, PLUS a couple minutes walk on from there was a DOOR to get out. I would have been very happy to have taken that door IN, seen the Mammoth Dome, and then just walked out again. I ached for days afterward. I realize my fault was in not having studied the different tour types, but the invitation of the Ranger at the beginning just seemed ""nice"", and we didn't have to wait for a later tour, so we went...","June 2, 2017",Too much for me,3,"Elkridge, Maryland",2

There still was plenty of tourist activity even then, so I imagine that this is a place that would be too crowded for me in high season. But I want to share with readers that even if you are claustrophobic, as I am, you will find plenty to enjoy about this beautiful national park. My husband did the cave tour. I stayed above-ground and hiked for two hours on the gorgeous forest trails. Various trails go down to the Green River, up hillsides dotted with slate ledges and hardwood groves, past a beautiful historic cemetery. The interpretive exhibits in the Visitor's Center are also very interesting.

Mammoth Cave,Mammoth Caves is a National Park established in 1941.. but the history and use of these caves literal goes back several thousand years. There is evidence that explorers of years gone by explored and used these caves for shelter and resources. So far they have documented/explored over 400 miles of known caves and passages. It is even a World Heritage site and is breathtaking (literally from beauty to the walking required) inside. There are multiple tours available to book depending on what you want to see in relations to the cave system. It is a primarily very dry cave but we did encounter water a few times in the forms of drips and such at least twice. Words cannot describe the large room or rotunda as they call it when you first enter. This should be a must do on your bucket list of things to do.,"June 1, 2017",A Must Experience,65,"Memphis, Tennessee",5

Mammoth Cave,"We spent Memorial day weekend exploring the park with our teenage kids. The caves and particularly the history was interesting. While the tours were large, like everything else in life there are tradeoffs. If you want to see the world's largest cave system; then there will likely be a few hundred of your closest friends there on any given holiday weekend to accompany you into the cave. We did several tours. My favorite was Domes and Dripstones which starts with skinny skinny stairs wedged into vertical chutes where you descend by zigging and zagging hundred+ steps into the lower cavern. This serpentine sharp descent in the wet narrow limestone cathedral of Mammoth Cave system was just way cool.Can't say enough how friendly, informative and helpful the entire park staff was.

Mammoth Cave,"We live in Illinois, and Mammoth Cave NP has been on our 'do this some day' list just about forever. We happened to be going to visit the east coast over Memorial Day and our route took us right by the park, so we added a stop. I'm so glad we did. The place is amazing - and I don't use that word lightly. The above ground park and trails are super. The hills of central Kentucky are picturesque. This whole area has been wiped clear of human habitation and replanted about 80 years ago, so it is pristine. A person could hike for a week and not exhaust the possibilities.We, however, came for the caves. We took two ranger lead cave hikes. The Domes and Dripstones tour takes you up and down 500 steps in the 'new' section of the caves. It is clammy, wet, beautiful, and completely worth it. It's not for the faint of heart of out of shape. The Historical Tour had me wondering at the easy ability of just two rangers to herd 150 people through caves where I was shocked they let anyone go. This tour was 500 steps and two miles (mostly dry, though) and in places it took some serious doing to get through the spaces. I bumped down steps on my rear under a 40 inch ceiling,, and skooched through spaced a foot wide and 15 feet long. They tell you at the beginning of each tour what you are in for - take them seriously. There were people on our tour that regretted going well past the point of returning.

I wore Tevas, everybody else wore closed tennis shoes, but nobody stopped me, and I was happy as it was hot. Didn't take a jacket in either, as we're from Utah so 54 degrees inside is not cold for us at all. Wear a backpack to have hands open when going down stairs! We did the Domes & Dripstones tours on recommendation of several people, but I was disappointed. It's too crowded and people are too slow.... we had to wait on the group to take pics the whole time, very very frustrating (can't imagine pics in the dark caves come out nice anyway!) I would much rather go on a shorter tour next time, e.g. the Frozen Niagra - and spend more time hiking around the gorgeous area. This tour took 2 hours, and then we had to get back to Nashville again.

Mammoth Cave,"If you are looking for fantastic stalagtites, stalagmites, and other such formations, Mammoth Cave should NOT be your destination. Frozen Niagara section has such features, but is a very small area. Most of the cave is composed of long featureless tunnels carved by water. There are a number of different cave tours that are led by Park Rangers but groups can get fairly large, and ability to hear the Ranger is often limited due to chatter among adults and especially small children. Tours are rather pricey for what you get. If you want to see a real fantastic cavern, make plans to visit Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico. You can explore most of the cavern alone and at your own pace with hand held radio receivers that describe the FANTASTIC cave formations. I would give Carlsbad TEN STARS, and you can also watch the bats fly out of the cave in the evening.

It is pretty cool because it take you to the snowball room where the writings on the walls go back to the 1830's. The Frozen Niagara Tour is a pretty easy Tour. My wife had knee replacement six months ago and did not have any problems. The formations are spectacular and are a must. I took the Domes and Dripstones Tour and for a senior a little challenging. Going into the cave, the is a great number of stairs going down. The stairway is narrow with handrails and limited headroom. I am six feet tall and hit my head a number on times. Some of the passages are narrow. I would advise against a back pack. There are downhill slopes and my knees took a little bit of a beating. Make sure you have some Advil with you for after the tour.

Serendipitous to this point of self reflection, I found myself a short distance from Mammoth Cave at the conclusion of a business trip and enroute home.Having taken the Historic Tour a few years ago, I was eager to revisit this vastly amazing microcosm again. Upon arrival yesterday, I was just in time to take the Domes & Dripstones Tour. This tour is physically more rigorous than the Historic Tour, as it involves an immediate descent via narrow stairway. However, for those who are able bodied to do so, I highly recommend doing so! The domes are spectacular! And the vast chambers appreciable via the Historic Tour are also present but still mesmerizing. Especially remarkable is the Frozen Niagara portion of the tour, where the formations will make you seem as if your are frozen in your tracks as your jaw drops and you scratch your mind's eye trying to figure out how this amazing underworld has existed for millennia even when we don't stop in our everyday busy-ness to appreciate it. Dear Pachamama, you have so much wisdom to impart to humankind and we are so blessed to have organizations like the National Park System to help us have these experiences of communing with nature's wonders so readily!!A honorable mention goes out to the Park Rangers who so gracefully handle the diverse array of innumerable visitors, every day!Though I have children and love bringing them with me for these types of experiences, I also enjoy solo time in nature. The current set up for this tour accommodates 100+ guests per tour, as well as families of all ages. A possible improvement to the tours is to offer some of these tours sans small children and at a pace that allows a little more time for thoughtful reflection inside the cave.

Just make sure to ask questions about the difficulty of the tour before you get your tickets. Even some of the ones labeled moderate are pretty difficult. Otherwise it's a great place to visit and explore the caves. There are also a few great hikes around the park.,"May 12, 2017",Love this place!,14,"Hollywood, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"A beautiful national park that's an easy 1.5 hour drive from Nashville and Louisville. Be sure to follow the park website's driving instructions from IH65, as GPS doesn't get it right.We enjoyed quick meals from the snack bar rather than the more pricey restaurant, and spent an hour or so learning so much from the extensive museum-like displays in the Visitor Center. A cave's critter life alone is enough to engage the curious--bats, eyeless fish, salamanders, & cave crickets, to name only a few! Above ground, there's plenty of hiking trails, but an easy one near the Visitor Center is the trail to Rocky Styx Spring, with blooming tulip poplar trees, plentiful butterflies, and the very cool-air historic entrance to Mammoth Cave.Touring the Great Onyx Cave (only lantern lit) with a well-informed & entertaining Ranger Elizabeth on Saturday afternoon was a highlight. She wove the American legend of Kentucky cave explorer Floyd Collins throughout her presentation, which added a most engaging human element. If you get really interested in Floyd Collins, you can hike to his family's Crystal Cave or to the infamous Sand Cave entrance. The Sand Cave trail is on Rt 255 between Park Ridge Rd & Wayfarer Inn. You'll pass it as you're driving 15 minutes from the Visitor Center to Cave City for a tasty dinner.","May 11, 2017",Easily access this gem of a national park,78,"New Braunfels, Texas",5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth is of course famous for being huge. I went on the Domes and Dripstones tour and I found it interesting but maybe not as pretty as some caves I have visited. The tour guide was an interesting character and brought the cave to life. Be aware that many of the tours sell out well in advance; you can go online to make reservations and I recommend doing so, particularly if you are coming from a distance. There are a number of pleasant hikes and walks on the surface, too.","May 9, 2017",A must-see if you like caves,44,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",4
Mammoth Cave,"Go to Calsbad Caverns in New Mexico to see the real thing, Mammoth Cave was a huge disappointment. What you see on their website of brochures is gratuitous photography that when you get on site you feel almost cheated. We took the Domes and Dripstones tour and their was little of either. The one stalactite bragged about was a very small landing at the bottom of a stairway that you looked up into for a second and got pushed back up the stairway. The tour started out bad as in addition to 15 or so tourists, they packed in 85 fourth graders on school outings. Just the expected noise in a cave made any hearing of the guide difficult, but the time it took to get a hundred people and kids down single persons width stairs to the stopping points delayed the tour enough so that one complete stop was canceled. The tourist sat and waited doing nothing for all this to occur. No explanation as to why the class outing did not have their own tour or why so many people at one time is acceptable. One guide was rude when questioned why such a large group of young kids would be attached to an adult group. He said ""they had as much right to buy a ticket as you do"" in a condescending manor which was not appreciated. If you do go, take exit 53 rather than the well signed and googled exit 58. Exit 53 takes you over the ridge on a beautiful drive over a narrow road and deposits you right at the caves. If you want the tourist trap stores return via the well used road which is well signed as I assume they want you to go past the commercial tourist interests. Recommend that you book in advance as many tours were full.","May 8, 2017",Not worth the 1 1/2 drive from Louisville,113,"Marco Island, Florida",1

Mammoth Cave,"We started our visit w/ a leisurely stroll around Sloan's pond taking in the local wildlife led by a ranger, great for kids!! The next day we embarked on the adult adventure of the Wild Cave Tour. Mountain hiking has never been a real challenge for DW and me while crawling required ""mammoth"" exertion and used different muscles. And though DW had no issues w/ past spelunking, this was intense, like you really were exploring. We bailed after lunch--DW was both physically & mentally exhausted by the first part. Two overweight (33"" waist) forty-somethings couldn't keep up the pace--maybe we should've taken the Intro. to Caving Tour, but it was the natural highlight of our roadtrip.

Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I took two tours at Mammoth Caves. There are several to choose from. The first one we went on was Cleaveland Avenue. We really liked this one because our ranger, Greg, took time for us to admire the rocks and caves and let us take many pictures. Also, our group was small so it made the movement of the tour flow easier. The second one was Domes and Dripstones. First off, the group was very large, over 100 individuals. And the tour was a little fast paced and didn't allow for us to stop and take pictures of the beautiful dripstones. There was lots of climbing of stairs, which, in itself wasn't bad, but with a large group it was just hard to enjoy and take in the beauty. Still, it was awesome to see the natural caves.

A tip if you want to know more about something in specific ask one of the park staff and if they don't know they will direct you to the right person. Also a great tip is to go during the week or over Christmas break because they will take a tour if they sell even 1 ticket and you could get a private tour during the winter.,"May 1, 2017",breathtaking adn great staff!,9,"Cave City, Kentucky",5
Mammoth Cave,Was a nice cave tour. We did the frozen niagra tour which took about 1 hour. Not too much walking and only some stairs. The tour guide was very nice and shared lots of interesting facts along the journey. Would love to go back and take a different tour. There are several different tours to do. ,"May 1, 2017",Enjoyed the cave tour,2,"Coldwater, Mississippi",5
Mammoth Cave,"First, I've been to some marvelous caves in Iceland, Mexico, Australia, California & Puerto Rico. Mammoth can certainly hold its own & is the largest system in the world (something I didn't know). Took two tours & received a mild discount for booking two separate tours, but they book up fast so I'd get to the Visitor's Centre/buy online as early as possible (they're in Central Time PS). Unfortunately, the website gives two sentence descriptions of each tour.The historic tour, which was closed for ~1 year? has recently reopened with new flooring. I thought it would be drab but it was FANTASTIC! Really showed the scale of the cave with some features I hadn't seen at any of the earlier mentioned countries! Aside from Cacahuamilpas in central Mexico, this was so large! Deemed ""Moderate"" if you are a healthy weight you will be fine. I rock climb but it's impossible not to pant while ascending. There are plenty of resting breaks.Domes & Dripstones tour was cool too, but I've seen much better decorations in Western Australia and even California. Mostly columns/stalags/stalacs and some curtains. Smaller than the area shown in the Historic Tour. Again, deemed ""Moderate"" you'll be fine but this had tighter areas. Luckily, there is no final ascent with this one.For both, the rangers really made the experience. With both, they'll turn the lights off so you get a feel but the content wasn't repeated/redundant to other tours. There's some so-so hiking near the Visitor's Centre. The sink hole dome was INCREDIBLY underwhelming as was Dixon's cave since you cannot go inside. However, the Green River Bluff trail had an excellent, beautiful lookout. Anyway, for the $ this is worth doing.","May 1, 2017",Historic tour now open!,147,United States,5
Mammoth Cave,"The tour had about 500 steps but the first 280 were down, we enjoyed the tour but expected more formations which finally came at the end of the two hour tourPassageway can be very narrow and with low overheads at times. Open toe shoes should be avoided as one woman on our tour found out","April 28, 2017",Domes & Dripstones Tour,163,Minnesota,4
Mammoth Cave,"The Caves are wonderful- deep limestone arches holding the mountain over your head, tight cracks to slip though, deep deep darkness when the ranger turns off the lights. And the flow stones and stalactites and other features are marvels. The inside of the cave is National Park quality- stairs and walks of stainless steel.But the National Park above ground was worn out and deeply in need of repair, rebuilding and maintenance. The short sighted budget cutting US Congress has failed to allocate sufficient funds to keep the park facilities in good repair. There is nothing modern in the visitor center, hotel or other facilities. The cabins look like they have been painted over for 100 years. The guardrails lining the park drives are rotted and wouldn't stop a bicycle. Roads themselves were long overdue for pavement.This is not what America is supposed to be like. It was like a National Park in some 3rd World country. This condition seems to be common in many of our National Parks. Sad day for America.","April 26, 2017",Another National Park starved for funds,31,"Circleville, New York",4
Mammoth Cave,"Yes, with 405 known miles of passages this is by far the largest in the world. Granted I only saw 2 miles on a 2-hour tour with the Frozen Niagara as the icing on the cake. Our ranger was young, funny and informative with a Georgia accent. Be forewarned, this time of year there are school field trips. We had a large group of 5th and 6th graders on our tour. The non school adults were driven in a separate bus and placed in front of the kids during are tour. Thank you, Rangers. With that said,, the kids were well behaved and asked really good questions. And our ranger was very good with this group of youngsters. Now there are a number of steps on the Dome and Dripstone Tour plus a number of tight spaces. Fear not. If you are in average condition it shouldn't be a problem. Do bring a jacket as the temperature is a constant 54 degrees year round. Wear sensible shoes- no flip flops or sandals. Also remember that tours can sell out quickly during the summer and spring break. You can always go online to secure a tour but not the day of. If you try the day of you will have to call them instead of going online. Don't be like a number of folks who drive to Mammoth Cave to find it sold out for the day. One other thing, if you are 62 or older buy a lifetime senior pass for $10. This will get you a big discount plus will get you in other natural parks for free if there is a charge. Sweet deal.

Mammoth Cave,"So the races got rained out so we headed home early and decided to stop here for a tour. We did the Domes and Dripstones tour, which was 2 hours and that being mostly because our group was about 100 people, we stopped at 3 different locations to listen to yhe geologist, but we had to wait at least 10 minutes each time for the entire group to get to the meeting point. It would have been much nicer to have smaller groups so the geologist could talk about things we were walking past. So basically you go down a bunch of steps, into a large opening of the cave to sit and ask questions and listen to a geologist, then get up and rush to the next spot to stop and sit to ask questions and listen, and repeat.....I would not recommend this tour, although I have been on several others that I feel have been much better.

Mammoth Cave,My wife and I have been on a number of different cave tours and thought this one would be similar. We were wrong and left impressed. We took the Grand Avenue Cave Tour which is a four mile underground walk over a four hour period. The ranger was awesome and told lots of interesting stories. You do need to be in pretty good shape to do the hike. Recommend that you wear good walking shoes. We also hiked the Green River Bluff Trail and the River Styx Spring Trail.

Spectacular entrance down 250 steps, most of the rest is a bit 'ho hum'; I've certainly seen lots better stalagmites and stalactites.

Lots of steps and staircases over dark and seemingly bottomless pits and some paths with no guardrails, which meant I was envisioning my kids tripping and falling to their deaths the entire time.

Steps are steep and narrow, and hand rails are provided but at times can be wet. You can take a camera but can not use flash, but the lighting is well enough to get good photos. Be sure to get there early enough because the tours sell out very quickly. Going into the cave you go down about 270 steps and going back out you climb a small incline until you get out.

Since it was Spring Break time, and Easter weekend, all of the tours sold out except ""Domes and Dripstones"" (we heard it is usually not hard to choose from a variety of tours). My husband and I are in our 60s and were a little afraid this tour would be too difficult with all the steps. We were pleasantly surprised; it wasn't too difficult at all (even with the tight spaces), and we moved at a comfortable pace. The guides were very interesting and pleasant.

Mammoth Cave,"Great spot for camping at the park's campground near the visitor center. Really clean bathrooms and plenty of grass at each site. Showers are for a fee at the campstore. The rangers were helpful on tour information at the VC and the guide on the Dome and Dripstones tour was funny. The tour itself was pretty cool. Don't expect to take many photos, it's too dark. There are a lot of stairs over 2 hours, often passing through small spaces. The big downside was the size of the tour group - about 80 people. The tour moves single file through the cave to a few different stopping points where the group gathers. If you're not in the front half, the ranger starts talking to the group due to timing and you will miss some information or stories. Please do not take babies on the tour. It was very hard to hear the guide sometimes with a crying baby at one point. The self-guided discovery in the large room is not informative - there are maybe 2 info plaques. The space is quite astounding and might be worth the $5 admission.","April 20, 2017","Great camping, good tour and guide but too large of a tour group",7,"Arvada, Colorado",3
Mammoth Cave,"My boyfriend and I did the Frozen Niagara tour...we were in the cave for about 45 minutes. I really wish I could've done a longer tour, but I don't always do well in tight spaces, so I opted for this tour. Overall, we spent about 4 hours in the park. We looked around the visitor center and went through the museum. The museum was very informative and every staff member we encountered was pleasant and helpful. Our tour was well organized and and I loved being able to walk under the Frozen Niagara formation. When we were there it was a fee free week (or something like that), so we opted to take advantage of that and went on the self guided cave tour. this part of the cave did not have any formations in it, but it is massive and was once used as a mine.

We were in a group with a ton of other people, it seemed like almost too many. I would've preferred fewer in a group. On the way down, there were lots of stairs and they were very small in width. If you are claustrophobic, I do not recommend this tour. My boyfriend is claustrophobic and almost had a panic attack on the way down. There's a bit of ducking to do and the stairs were a bit slippery from the dripping water. The tour lasted about 2 hours, and we learned alot thanks to the rangers that came with us! The rangers were funny, friendly, and answered everyone's questions. It was very cool to see the inside of a cave and learn about it at the same time. There isn't very much uphill/upstairs walking to do in case it could tire you out. I do not recommend taking children on this tour, as they could easily fall or touch things they aren't supposed to touch.

Mammoth Cave,"This is a great park; not quite what we expected but still a great time. The park is about 20 miles off the interstate. The drive from highway 255 - Cave City is really pretty. Make important note that you have to book one of the cave tours in order to see the caves. If you just show up, it's quite possible that all the cave tours will be booked! We went in early November and a large # of the tours were sold out when we arrived. From what I read, the summer and holidays can get extremely busy. We were lucky that they had some tours available when we got there. We did the Frozen Niagra tour. We would have loved to do more but it was the only tour we could get in. Our tour guide was probably the best thing about the tour. He was informative and really funny. The park rangers really take a lot of pride in the park and it shows. The main area of the cave was not really mammoth but I would say more about the size of a medium size gymnasium. The ""mammoth"" comes from the sheer size of the entire cave system. Still it's impressive. The gift shop was really nice and my wife bought a bunch of souvenirs. We had a picnic over at the picnic area and after that we hiked the Green River Bluff trail. It was a short 1.3 moderately strenuous trail. Will go back if we are in the area again.

We just did the 1.25 hour Frozen Niagara tour which was a perfect way to see some of the cave and still get us back on the road at an early hour. We had 88 year old Papa with us and he was able to do the tour too! We just had to have one of us in front of him and the other one behind him to help him see so he didn't bump his head when you had to duck down on occasion.

I think I can cross this one off my bucket list...I'm not in the shape I was 20 years ago so... Word of warning my thighs were killing me afterward so listen to the Rangers about how strenuous the tour is and consider it.

Mammoth Cave,"We took the Domes and Dripstones tour while in Kentucky this week. Overall, the tour is really neat. Although it takes two hours, there are stops where you sit and rest in order to hear some history of the cave. There are some pretty tight spaces you have to squeeze around. My 250 pound husband had to do some creative maneuvering, but managed to make it through. Our only complaint was a child who was allowed to wear a miner's helmet with a light that was on more than a few occasions pointed at people's eyes. Are these even allowed? Neither of the rangers said anything, yet people were complaining to each other left and right. If flash photography isn't allowed, these shouldn't be either.

The tour was about 4 miles long and took about 4 hours with the stops.

Mammoth Cave,"We signed up two days in advance for the two-hour Domes and Dripstones Tour on a Monday in April. There were 100-150 people in our tour, and the two rangers did a good job of keeping us moving, explaining what we were seeing, and answering questions from young and old. Some stairs and tunnels are narrow and tight, other spaces are huge rooms, with benches for the full group to rest before moving on. Be sure to wear sturdy footwear, and long sleeves. There was a problem with a few lights (!!!) and the rangers had propane lanterns in one section, which added to the excitement. The final section named Niagara Falls is the most beautiful and picturesque. It's just a short walk up a few stairs from there to the exit. We were really glad we took the guided tour and not a self-guided tour. Our only disappointment was that the gift shops don't have the 2016 National Park anniversary vintage-style T-shirt designs.

Going on a Cave tour may seem intimidating at first, but this one is not. It does have a lot of stairs that go down, and it also has a few tight spaces, but it's not a difficult trek. For those who are scared of tight places or dark, it honestly doesn't feel confined, and it's very well lit. Be sure that you read ahead regarding backpacks, bringing young children, and wearing shoes that have been in another cave. Also, as you have read, book early! My family will return to Mammoth Cave again soon and will be trying out the Woodland Cottages. We hope to have another great experience at Mammoth Cave.

Mammoth Cave,"Sonja And I took the Self Guided Discovery Tour before we went on the Domes and Dripstones Tour. The Discovery Tour cannot be made by reservation and it's recommended that you call the day of your visit for availability. The Discovery Tour starts with a fairly steep trail through the hillside to and from the cave entrance. The Tour gives insight on how caves are formed, a history of early cave dwellers and explorers as well as some of the commercial uses of the caves. There are Rangers on hand to offer information on various points of the Tour. This tour drops 160 feet in elevation, includes a total of 160 stairs and includes all of the Mammoth Passage Tour and part of the Historic Tour and takes about a 1/2 hour to complete. A good pair of hiking shoes or sneakers with ankle support is recommended. We recommend this Tour if you don't have much time to spend in the Park.","April 10, 2017",Mammoth Cave Discovery Tour visit April 2017,11,"West Babylon, New York",5

My knees are not the best so I stayed in the front with the guide and she matched my pace. She was knowledgeable, patient, and confident. We had about 120 people on our tour as it was spring break. I was glad I was up front or I would have felt a little closed in with all those people. Some of the spaces were a little tight to get through--it might be tough if you were extremely overweight or unusually tall but we were ok. It was fantastic! And we especially liked when they turned out all lights and we experienced being in a completely dark cave...wow! Wear a jacket and good gripping shoes (I wore my running shoes which were fine).

Mammoth Cave,"This was our 25th National Park and we were not disappointed. We only had one day here which was not enough time to do it justice. We began in the morning with the film in the Visitor Center and then a ranger lead tour which was very informative. We then took a hike down to a spring along the Green River and enjoyed the spring weather and wildflowers. We took the Domes and Drips tour in the cave. It lasted 2 hours and was very impressive. This tour is moderately difficult as it begins with a set of 280 stairs leading down into the cave. There were 120 people on the tour walking single file through narrow passages. There were three stops on the tour that were conducted in large cave rooms. The ranger shared information during these stops. We loved this tour. Personally, I would not recommend it for young children, although there were several ""little troopers"" who did really well. Don't miss the ice cream shop after the tour!

Mammoth Cave,"We spent the weekend in Cave City. We spent some time exploring Mammoth Cave National Park and visited three area caves - Mammoth, Diamond and Onyx.  As others have emphasized - when planning Mammoth Cave tours, be sure to book ahead. We booked our tour about 2 weeks in advance. I met some people who'd tried to book about 10 days out and every single tour was sold out.  Our schedule worked out that the Mammoth Cave ""Domes and Dripstones"" tour was our 3rd, and final cave visit. In comparison with Diamond and Onyx caves, it was disappointing.  Most of the tour takes place in ""dry"" cave. You're essentially walking through a big, rock tunnel with debris piled on each side. Except for the very end, there aren't any really impressive formations. The big climax, a waterfall and 5 story formation, isn't as pretty as anything you'll see at Diamond.  The size of the cave is stunning. The chambers are huge - but there are a lot of places that would benefit from better lighting to highlight the depth of crevices or the length of side tunnels. Flash photography is NOT allowed so picture taking is difficult.  The group size, 112 people, is another hindrance. The main ranger leads the group. A second ranger brings up the rear. The gentleman who trailed our group was pleasant and answered questions, when asked, but his function was clearly simply to turn off the lights and ensure that nobody was left behind. He didn't narrate at all.  Before we entered the cave, the lead guide asked that slowest people come to the front, and that those who move fast fall to the rear. We are two fit adults without kids, so we did as she asked and fell to the very rear. As a consequence, we often either stood for 2-3 minutes at a time waiting for the roughly 100 people in front of us to navigate the stairs or ramp, etc we were climbing, or we had to walk rapidly through empty chambers to reach wherever the group had collected again.  The latter was incredibly frustrating. There are three gathering points throughout the tour, with bench seating. At each of these, the guide would give more history and details about the cave. At least, I assume that's what she did. Inevitably, as those of us in the far rear of the group caught up, she'd say ""and everyone is here now, so we're going to finish here and move on now."" We missed probably 90% of the ""guided"" part of the tour, which was pretty annoying.  The sheer size of Mammoth Cave makes in interesting and the surrounding park is lovely. You could spend days exploring the park and never visit the cave itself at all. Every single ranger and staff member with whom we interacted was delightful and friendly. I would absolutely go back to Mammoth Cave National Park. I'd even return to the cave - either on a different tour, or this tour - just at the front of the group.","April 2, 2017","Beautiful Park - Cave Tour was ""eh.""",66,"Indianapolis, Indiana",4
Mammoth Cave,"I was so looking forward to this site:) Left kind of unimpressed:( HERE is one ""key"" you better DO! Get your tickets in advance if your going to do anything more than the Discovery Cave self guided tour. When we arrived, parking was almost non-existent:( We had a hard time parking and others starting parking on the curb:( Once in:) We quickly found out all tour times were sold out:( We arrived around 12:45pm. ALSO, my advice is to check tour costs, can be expensive if taking the whole family. ( Have always said-People pay so much in taxes today, hammering them also through THEIR national parks seems a little unfair to me) So we had to settle on the self guided $5.00 Discovery Cave tour. Yet, it is a easy walk inside. I personally though they needed a little more walking path light for people. Still, there wasn't really anything to see:( It's just a cave, charging people $5.00 for this is really sad:( There are park guides in the cave to answer questions:) Yet, with the many people in the cave due to coming and NOT being able to do any other tours made it somewhat crowded:( No information explaining anything about the cave:( And WHO could find a guide within the darkness and crowd? Howabout give them glow lights or something to stick out amongst the crowd.You will notice signage boards outside the cave before entering explaining many things:) Still, some of the signs are worn out and make them hard to read:( Detail is everything:) when it seems your getting charged for everything:( Liked the gift shop, could not buy a shirt due to no medium sizes:( I have visited 63 national parks for far:) This one was probably the most disappointing:(","April 2, 2017",Detail And Explaining.

We did the ""domes and dripstones"" tour and I can't recommend it enough. It was the longest ""mass market"" tour at 2 hours and around 100 people in the group. The description can sound intimidating but its really not. The tour is designed for large numbers of people to shuffle through efficiently. Also as long as you have kids that are up to walking .75 miles its great for them as well. Our 4 and 6 year olds did it with no problems at all. The tour has two ranger guides and they were extremely friendly and did a fantastic job explaining everything you could want to know about the site. Don't be scared off by all the warnings they give...if you are able to walk a mile at a slow place this tour will be no problem for you....also even though it is two hours long the time flys by....part of it is spent on a short bus ride two and from the site and there are two other sections where you sit for about 15 minutes each in giant caverns listening to presentations.","March 29, 2017",Be sure to book cave tours before arriving!,26,Chicago,5
Mammoth Cave,"We took 2 different tours while visiting Mammoth Cave National Park.The Great Onyx tour was a shorter tour, only about 1 mile. It was interesting because we had to carry our own lanterns (about 10 for the entire group of 35). There weren't a lot of formations, but it was an interesting cave with good stories. The guide knew a lot of the history of the cave and had some personal connections to it and those that worked there in the past. Overall, it was a good tour. Not too strenuous at all.The Grand Avenue tour was much longer and my favorite part of our trip. It is a 4 mile, 4 hour tour. The first 3 miles aren't too bad. It's mostly flat and a fairly easy walk with a little bit of up and down. The last mile is where it starts to get hard. There are some pretty big inclines and declines. Nothing is dangerous, but it is steep. There are handrails everywhere to hold on to. In any event, the tour of the cave is magnificent. There aren't a whole lot of formations to see because the cave is mostly dry (until the end when you get to Frozen Niagra). However, walking through the large openings is pretty cool. There were a lot of places I wanted to stop and look or take pictures, but you have to keep moving in order to get to the end in time. There were not many tight places to fit through. Only a few in the Daniel Boone chamber, but they weren't bad for me (and I'm somewhat claustrophobic). The guides were both great and very informative. I'd highly recommend this tour if you're able to walk 4-5 miles with some steep inclines.

We went on the domes and dripstones tour. Areas are tight in the cave and even at 5'0"" I had to duck down time to time. It was wet and slippery in the cave as well and although it is lit, lighting is dim. There were families with young children but keep in mind there are a lot of stairs and tight staircases, so it's not an easy trek.

It's worth stopping by the historic entrance for the small waterfall into the cave opening, The visitor center exhibits are basic but good, mostly focused on the science of the area and some history.

We stayed in the sunset rooms of the hotel. The room was a typical NP ""older"" room but we love national parks and this is part of the charm for me. The room was spacious for my family of four. Cell service and Wi-Fi was spotty but, again, part of the charm. We weren't there to play on our phones.

We got to see some spectacular formations and an underground lake. The tour includes no more than twelve steps, but additional 46 are optional at the end of the tour near the Frozen Niagara formation for those who want to see it up close from a different angle.

We're SO glad we did!!We investigated the tour availability and choices online and made our reservations on line which was really nice. Upon arrival at the Visitor Center we got in line, picked up our tickets and then went through the education area to learn about the cave and its history. All was very well done.We took the Domes and Dripstones Tour which was lead by Ranger Randy and assisted by Ranger Corey. Both were great guys and the information provided by Ranger Randy was SO interesting. His family has a very long history with the cave and he was kind enough to share it with our group. Not only was he interesting, but he was very entertaining and made learning so very enjoyable especially with his keen sense of humor. We could not have asked for better rangers to guide us on this tour.The tour lasted about 2 hours and people should be aware that this tour is not for those who are afraid of heights or close spaces since you climb down 253 feet on stairs that at times are no more than 1.5 feet wide. There are times when you need to duck and move into unusual positions to get your body through some of the passageways. You may get some dirt or water on your clothing, so dress appropriately for an environment that is 54 degrees.

Mammoth Cave,"We arrived actually early to Mammoth Cave because we did not think about it, but it is Central Time over there so be sure you know. Worked out great though. The tour schedule unfortunately in the winter is super limited, which was yes, disappointing, but it was still fine and good. We did the drips and domes tour which was the longer of the two available and was only $15 each. They bussed us up to the entrance and it took about two hours. There were two times during the tour where we gathered and the ranger spoke for a while.. I didn't realize that was going to happen, but it was informative. Lots of stairs in a tight area. I'm somewhat not cool with tight areas, but I was fine. It's not like that the whole way though and opens up to pretty big spaces. All the super cool stuff is at the end, where of course everyone wants pictures. Our ranger got noticeably cranky at the end (I guess because they want more tours to come in), but really they must know people want to enjoy it a little. They could make the tour 15 minutes longer or cut out some of the talking in the middle or just be patient with the people on the tour. They definitely try to rush you through. Overall, was still pretty great to see everything. I would love to do a longer/harder tour in the future.","March 5, 2017",Cave Tour Drips,5,"Islip, New York",4
Mammoth Cave,"We visited Mammoth Caves Nat Park in July 2016. We camped in our pop-up camper. We were able to make online reservations ahead of time on the Nat Parks website. I noticed that only a few sites were reserveable and the rest were first come, first served. When we arrived the park was not full, so I guess we would have been okay. But I don't like to chance things like that. Our site was nice and large and near the bathhouse. We didn't have electric, I know most NP don't, but some do. For the shower we had to go to the camp store and purchase tokens. The tokens were good for 10 minutes. The showers were inside the mens and womens bathrooms, as opposed to being central showers. This meant we needed even more tokens and couldn't just shuffle all the kids through one shower. The shower my daughter put her token in was busted, but she was already undressed. There was a trickle down the wall. Were were able to get a replacement token from a maintenance guy and then a refund from the store. It was annoying at the time, but she remembers it now semi-fondly as one of the worst camp showers she's had. LOL. We also went on the Historical Cave Tour. It was fun and i'd highly recommend it!

Recommended for those with good to great physical stamina as you will encounter a lot of steps and tight places. Chelsea our guide did an excellent job of providing sufficient information to keep you safe. She also provided a substantial amount of cave and park history to keep us interested and answered several questions in detail. Sufficient lighting is there to allow one to see the highlights the cave has to offer. Flash photography is verboten plus tripods/monopods are not allowed so don't expect sensational photos.

Mammoth Cave,Take the car ferry over the Green River just for fun! It is a very small three car ferry that runs over the green river. Takes about one minute to get across it is really fun to ride. Check it out! We took the dorms in drip stones tour led by ranger Luke. He did a great job of preparing us for what we would encounter once we got underground.. there were a lot of steps leading down to the first big room. There we learned a bit about the history of the cave and the geology. Then we walked through other caves learn more about it and finally ended up at the frozen Niagara formation. We really liked that part. It was a good tour. We also ate at the mammoth cave hotel and had a good lunch! It was January so there weren't many people around.

Mammoth Cave,"It is interesting to see so may unenthusiastic reviews for this amazing place. I went with a buddy in January 2017 and had a great time!. We took the Domes & Dripstones Tour for 15 bucks. There was quite a lot of people on our tour. 95+ which was considered a ""smaller"" group. The tour is oriented in a single file line, so we opted to stay near the front of the pack right behind the Park Ranger/Tour Guide. This was definitely the way to go and we were able to ask any questions and receive additional info during the tour. I can see how the tour might seem uninformative if you stay in the middle of the pack where there isn't a guide.If you take the Domes & Dripstones Tour, please understand that this tour is a bit more physical than the average tour. If you don't enjoy nature walks you will not enjoy this tour at all, as climbing down 500 steps is mandatory to even begin the tour. If you are massively out of shape, ill, or handicapped, don't even consider the Domes & Dripstones Tour. If you can manage a nice walk/hike, check it out! its awesomeAs for the ""poor lighting"".....IT'S A CAVE!!!! I find it humorous that people are bothered by this. bring a flashlight if you must, but it is rather harmful to the cave to have a bunch of lights on inside the cave. it introduces algae wich is invasive inside the cave and causes an imbalance in the food chain, so the park plays their part in turning the lights on as you enter and turning them back off upon leaving.This tour is great for friends and family who enjoy a good hike, nature trail, or like watching national geographic documentaries.

Mammoth Cave,"We were here during a weekend Cub Scout trip. Unfortunately, the schedule for the trip was pretty packed so we were only here for one tour, Domes & Dripstones. We got there early enough to check out the museum in the visitor's center and it had lots of very good information about how the caves came to be and the shear size of the cave system.The tour was very good. Getting in through the ""new"" entrance involved going down a lot of steps and a few tight spots. I'm a big guy so I can't say the idea of getting stuck somewhere didn't cross my mind, but I was able to make it through without a problem. Once you get to the ""old"" part of the cave, there's a large cavern with rows of benches set up. The guide gave a good history of the cave and the portion of the cave we had just come through. From this area on, the going was a lot more open and was a lot more incline/decline walking as opposed to steps. There's another stop a little further down with benches and more good info and ""surprises"". Towards the end is an optional trail behind/under Frozen Niagara. They make sure to warn you that you're getting an extra 48 steps down and then back up to do it, but it is well worth it.It's been over 10 years since I'd been here, but we'll definitely be back when we can spend more time.","January 18, 2017",Trip Was Too Short,22,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5

If you are taller than 6', wear a hat or better a helmet or you will leave a part of yourself in the cave. The first half is a walk after descending a long vertical shoot is a meander along a dry river bed. The second half is all about dripstones around the Frozen Niagara.

Take a hike out the gravel road on Flint Ridge to the former Floyd Collins home or hike the gravel road to Great Onyx Cave (gated now), the former site of a hotel and visitor center when the site was privately owned. Might see wild turkey, deer, bobcats, fox, coyotes, possums and more! There is a small convenience store and restaurant at the park, but has limited hours in the off-season.

Mammoth Cave,"Before you visit Mammoth you should understand there is a major difference in caves. Some caves are very wet and have a vast amount of drip-stone formations like stalagmites and stalactites, other caves are dry and have few formations.Due to the geology and size of Mammoth, it has both, but mostly Mammoth is a dry cave. If you wish to see drip-stone formations, I would suggest that the Domes and Dripstones tour is your best bet. If you are seeking a ""wet cave"" experience with large and impressive formations, be aware that there are other caves in the general area that feature more extensive formations and a quick search on TripAdvisor will reveal these.I would suggest that after experiencing Carlsbad Caverns earlier in my life, I was mildly disappointed with Mammoth Cave, however, I am still pleased that I toured the cave and learned about the unique geology that formed the longest cave system in the world.","January 1, 2017","Caves Wet, Caves Dry ............................................................................

Some interest as a place where saltpeter was mined for gunpowder but without a good guide who could entertain a very boring hole in the ground. Our guide did a wonderful job with just enough humor and knowledge to make this interesting and fun. No formations to be wow but explaining how it was formed and why bat guano is good was entertaining. Restaurant food a 2 to 3. Waitress was great but food selection very basic and mostly without much tAste or originality. No alcohol for drinks. Come on Kentucky get your act together. Is Sprite better for you than a Chardonnay. Don't think so. There are not enough guides or the groups need to be larger so the demand for these tours can be met.

I am all about keeping the caves protected but perhaps a brochure and 15 mins would have been ok as the whole tour was 2hrs, so 1/4 of the time on long winded speeches about slipping and. It touching the rocks seems too long. Secondly, this is a group of 3 busloads of people which is way too many, it felt like a line a Disney land for the 1.5hrs we were down there. Also, it's some tricky stairs and walking and people brought toddlers, they absolutely need to restrict that as it was inappropriate and slowed the group down even more. Lastly, our ranger guide spoke to us like we were all 4 years old and had some terrible cough that kept her hacking the whole time.

Take the easy tour if you have small children or difficulty climbing steps...The Drips and Drones tour was excellent for my 16 year old daughter. We enjoyed the tour especially the ranger commentary. Very large group so get close to the guide to ask questions along the way. It is a long line through the cave of about 120 people.

The trip down into the cave is 250 ft of steps, very narrow at times (not good if you're claustrophobic), after that there are a lot of narrow passages to make it through, and you will go down another 100 feet. Of course, you then have to come back up that 350 feet.

Mammoth Cave,"We did the domes and dripstones tour. The guide was amazing, very knowledgable and helpful. The passages and stairs are a little narrow but as long as you are reasonably mobile you should not have an issue. The visitors centre was nice but be aware there is no where that sells drinks so make sure you take one with you.","December 18, 2016",Amazing tour,30,"Derby, United Kingdom",4
Mammoth Cave,"We took two of the cave tours during our time at Mammoth Cave National Park : Domes & Dripstones and the Mammoth Tour. Each tour was unique and had an interesting approach to the cave system. The first tour (Domes & Dripstones) was rather intense in the amount of stairs and my 6 year old was apprehensive to go down the tight, steep winding staircases. With a little distraction and motivation from the spectacular Ranger Jim, we were able to make it work! He talked to her pretty much the entire time we traveled down the staircases, talking about horses, school, etc. and even gave her the duty of turning on the lights in each section of the cave. (Lights are turned on and off as the group enters and leaves portions of the cave to help preserve the cave). This was great tour but I would recommend not trying the stairs with little ones. The passageways are tight in some spots and you have to duck a bit in places. The second tour was through the Historic entrance and it was a huge cave access point compared to the other cave tour. This tour was full of high domed ceilings and pleasant walkways - would be a great intro for someone who wants to explore the caves but has a bit of claustrophobia. The rangers we interacted with were superb professionals. Our groups were small due to the season and the exhibits in the visitor's center were engaging and interesting for everyone in our group. If you have children don't forget to have them get the Junior Ranger certificate! We plan to return to try some hiking and other activities in the warmer months. Definitely worth a repeat visit.","December 12, 2016",Family underground adventure,56,"Nashville, Tennessee",5
Mammoth Cave,"The first visit to Mammoth Cave was in 1954 (I was 5 yo) Went with my family. I was amazed as how Mother Nature could do the ""stalagmites"" and ""stalactites"". Walking around and when the ranger turned the lights off and you think how to get out when 5. I took my wife and 2 daughters back when in 1995 (when I was 60 yo) rocks not grown any, lights still go off. But not worried. Left bread crumbs. Kids were amazed and took boat tour of river too. It is a sight that should be seen and enjoyed by families","December 9, 2016",My first visit in 1954,5,"Jonesville, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"We went on the Domes and dripstones tour. The cave is a dry cave, so you will not see stalactites and stalagmites until you reach the Frozen Niagra at the end of the tour. Be sure to bring good walking shoes; there are lots of steps and will also be some fairly steep inclines. Very interesting place to see God's handy work underneath the surface of the ground. We stayed at the national park campground. The campground does not have electricity or water. The bathrooms of the campground were clean, but had no showers. Large sites, worth staying at.","December 6, 2016",Domes and Dripstones tour,37,"River Falls, Wisconsin",4

Mammoth Cave,"There were a total of 406 steps up and 5 down to get to the Drapery Room (my husband decided to count them!). To go inside the Drapery Room, it was 49 steps each way. Then there were five more steps down and quite a few ramps up to the exit where a bus was waiting to take us back to the entrance. We did the Dome and Dripstones tour. 250 feet down below. It wasn’t quite like I expected. It was better than the history tour we did last time though. We walked down to see the Frozen Niagara which was pretty and had some nice formations. You had to walk down 49 steps and of course back up. You could decline this part of the tour if you wanted to (I'd recommend it if you are able). There were some stalagmites and stalactites, but again, not what I was expecting. You have to take about a ten minute bus ride to the start of the cave.","December 3, 2016",Dome and Dripstones,104,"Groton, Connecticut",4
Mammoth Cave,"First: make reservations through the national park website. I forgot and was almost out if luck. Thankfully I should up before they opened to be the first one there looking for first come/first serve tickets. They had added two more tours! My kids and I were thrilled. Second: we went on the Domes and Drips tones tour with Ranger Jamie. There are many stairs at the beginning, but if you are in decent health, I think you'd be fine. My kids (5-9) handled them all just fine. This tour was great, really informative and cool to see. This time of year, there are only three tours available and this one incorporates the easier Frozen Niagara tour route.  Third: the Jr. Ranger program was fun for the kids to complete and learn all about the geology, animals, and history of the cave.  Fourth, if you have the time for more than one tour, I think you'd want to do more. I certainly wanted more. Not because I thought the tour wasn't enough for the time and money spent, but because this site is just so impressive and peaks one's curiosity and sense of adventure!","December 3, 2016",Wonderful!!

I would recommend the tour- but make sure that you were tennis shoes as parts of the cave were slippery. The visitors center was very nice, I liked the movie that was playing (about how the cave was formed, etc), and all the park rangers I interacted with were nice and helpful. Overall, I think we spent 3 hours there (including the tour)","November 22, 2016",Good cave visit,50,"Atlanta, Georgia",4

The tour was very good -- if you are in decent shape and not tremendously overweight, the small passages and many stairs down should not be a problem. The tour was informative. We also took the short walk to the old entrance which was interesting; also, we did the loop around the main area -- which includes overlooks of the river and one of the areas where the water flows from the cave to the river.

Mammoth Cave,"We had been on the Domes & Dripstones and one of the others of interest was sold out so we hit the basic tour that starts with a walk down the hill to the first natural entrance. It is a great fairly short tour and as usual the guides were fantastic. After, go hiking to the right as you come out of the cave, if you want some challenges they have them there. Some trails are easier, some have lots of uphill steps and ledges. Stop at the crest and take in the beauty of the landscape and the river. There are also surface tours that tell you the history of Mammoth Cave. It is quite fascinating and October was a perfect time to visit the onsite grave yard. This park has tons of trails all around and you can stop and park at many different stops to walk trails. Be careful of those that allow horses, you have to watch for those land mines. Different trail lengths for different people and abilities. They have added handicap ones too!

Mammoth Cave,"I came here with family and we did the Domes and Dripstones tour. The park itself is free but any tours were an added cost. I had been to a couple caves before but my husband had not. We were early getting there thinking it was in the eastern time zone--it's not, and we must not be the only people who get confused as once we were there we saw signs all over the park indicating it was central time zone--so we had the opportunity to check out the museum in the visitor's center. Super informative and neat to see and the tour was good as well, I think it is worth the price. I would recommend a tour as I believe that is the only way you can really get down into the caves; I could be mistaken but several of the areas the rangers had controls for the lights and locked entryways. Afterward we hiked around the the area immediately surrounding the visitor's center, about 5 miles in total if you did all the little offshoots like we did. Easy hiking and quiet so nice to get away and enjoy the outdoors.","November 15, 2016",Lots of tours but they sell out quickly,18,Chicago,4

We took one tour and there were only about 15 people so you could hear everything the guide said. It was fun and interesting. Try to take a few tours so you can see everything.

Mammoth Cave,"I'm not sure Mammoth is the 2nd worst but it was a bit disappointing compared to 40+ other parks I've been in. The tours are so packed with people in a tight space. We did the Domes and Dripstones tour and had three bus loads of folks. Ok, maybe another tour would be better but I'm comparing this experience not only to other parks but other caves such as Luray Caverns and Carlsbad Caverns. Mammoth is big but I just did not see a lot of cave wonder. You know what was a wonder was how they built such cool stairs in such a wacky place. I just felt like I was walking in a metro. Guide kept telling us about the bugs but, no lights would expose them and he discouraged us from using our phone or flashlight or flash. I get it I don't want to mess up vision of everyone but, that is one dark cave.Sure a lot of folks say it is ""spectacular, incredible or amazing"" (maybe they could get out more) I'm happy they enjoyed it so much. Sure the guides are fine.Real hint: if you want any chance to sit and rest you best be close to the front of a group. It seemed to us that the group would walk along and reach a room with seats. The first to show up would sit and rest, wait for the rest of the group to show up. Once the last person would show up a short talk would happen and then the walking would start thus the last people would get little sit time.I'm sure it is a good idea to keep a NP funded in that part of the country. It is a valuable resource and a lot of people don't get a chance to explore natural sites like it or go out see the larger parks of the country. But when you see other sites, this one left me at a new low. I would not pick this as a big vacation place Vs. most other NPS sites. If you've seen The Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone, Zion, Tetons, Bryce, Glacier, Great Smoky, Haleakala, Olympic .....sure go to Mammoth, why not if it is close or just love caves I guess to each his own.

You take a short bus trip to and from the entrance to the cave. You should know ahead of time that this tour it can be somewhat claustrophobic. So I would suggest that you check out the NPS website for the information on the tours. They have tours that range from 1 hour to 6+ hours. You can choose according to you time and stamina.

We took the Great Onyx tour by lantern, which was a special treat. The hike itself was not too difficult, and it was neat to tour by lantern light. In the afternoon we did the Domes and Dripstones tour. This was a much more demanding tour. Be forewarned that there are a LOT of stairs and the passageway through the rock down the 280 stairs you descend into the cave is VERY narrow. That said, it was an amazing tour with incredible formations, domes, and sinks. We wished we had more time to go on some of the surface hikes and other ranger guided events - maybe next time.

Also cell service was very sketchy, which was also ok. Our first day we crossed the Green River via the ferry and hiked 7 miles on the north side of the park. There is tons of hiking all over the park. One night after a campfire talk at the amphitheater we asked the ranger if we could sit around the fire. He was just going to put it out. His name was Ranger Jim and he sat and talked with us for over an hour! He was so personable and interesting to talk to! We really enjoyed sitting around the fire with him!

Mammoth Cave,"Tips: Be sure to reserve tickets ahead of time. Tickets sell out well in advance (weeks for some) and for sure at least 2 days before. Luckily the good starter tours seem to run fairly frequently with openings. We did the Domes and Dripstones tour, one of the good starter tours. When they say they recommend getting there 30 minutes before your reserved time, this seems about right. We actually got there with maybe 5 minutes before tour started but had a hard time finding parking (we found one spot easy but not a second). By the time we got into the visitor center, they were already calling for ""last calls"" for our tour. We made it, but it was stressful. The tour guide (we never caught his name but he was awesome, a retired teacher who was perfect for the tour, perfect mix of knowledge, humor, and charisma) was already giving an intro the tour and things to look out for. The tour itself starts with a bus ride to the start, I'd say a 5 minute ride or so. The entryway feels like you're entering an entirely different world. I told my fiance it felt like we were entering the Jurassic Park in the sense it was isolated and wild with railings down to underground access doors. You immediately get into the caves and it's a ton of fun. Narrow passages, multiple segments of different caverns that look quite different (due to how they were formed) that are broken up with 3 large rooms with benches that were well-designed to allow for people to take a break and sit, while hearing the guides tell us about what we saw and what we will see.Definitely my favorite portion was the Frozen Niagara and it fit well with the sequence of the tour. It's a nice contrast to the types of passages and rooms that were formed just a little way away from that room. You end up walking a decent distance underground, as you can appreciate from the drive back (you pass the entrance).A great 2 hour tour. We spent the rest of the day hiking over-ground which shouldn't be overlooked. A ton of nice overlooks and springs. We hiked for another 2-3 hours which was very enjoyable. Saw a few deer just 10-15 feet away. Definitely something worth seeing at least once and maybe a few times, with all the different caves.","October 29, 2016",Amazing place with some great tour guides,19,"Seattle, Washington",5

The path in does go into some tight areas, but there's really no problem getting through. Most of the path has railings bordering it.The park staff recount the history of the cave during the tour, and answer questions. There are a couple of rest stops, and the tour moves at a slow pace.

Parking was not a problem as there are ample spaces available. The center itself is very nice. Rangers are available to answer questions. There are exhibits and gift shops. Tickets for tours can be bought there (or online). We selected the Domes and Dripstones tour. This starts with a short bus ride to the cave entrance. Upon entering, you descend down roughly 280 stairs and through a few tight places (FYI... We had a couple people on the tour drop out due to the confined space.) After descending, you walk through white limestone tunnels and past some nice rock formations, stopping at points along the way for talks and demonstrations from our tour guides. The cave is somewhat ""primitive"" with minimal lighting and natural walkways, so, it does help to wear shoes with good tread on them. Upon exiting, the tour ends with a short bus trip back to the Visitors Center. The tour lasts about 2 hours, and in total, we spent about 4 hours in the park.

Mammoth Cave,"This cave is massive beyond imagination. It is so large, that it has numerous tours covering various sections and varying in length from a short introductory tour to a four hour wild cave tour. Of special interest is the Trog Tour, which is a wild cave tour for younger children, no adults (except for the guide) allowed. Four of my grandchildren (3 boys and 1 girl) did the tour and loved crawling through dark reaches of the cavern with only a headlamp. All of the tours are great. I have done all but the adult wild cave tour. If you are a first time visitor, the shorter tours are a good start, though I would not recommend the very short intro tour unless that is all you can do, only because you only get a brief history lesson and get to see one large room. There is so much of this cave to see. There are very dry parts to very wet parts. You can book in advance online and should since most of the tours are small and sell out quickly. All tours involve negotiating step and inclines, though all have nice paths except for the wild cave tours. Some tours involve a lot of stairs so check closely the tour you are booking. If you wait to book when you get there, you will be very limited. The Grand Avenue tour is long, but by far my favorite. Tickets are half price for annual pass and senior citizens with a pass. The grounds in the park have lots of trails, a nice river and a campground with no hookups. There is a general store, a nice hotel and two eating options. A very nice restaurant and a snack stand are in the hotel.

We stayed at a nearby motel, and due to our long drive ahead of us the next morning, we only had time for the one hour Frozen Niagara tour. We did arrive early enough in the morning to get tickets without having a reservation, which is usually a good idea. But we went on a Monday, so I am sure it is why we got tickets so easily. We had 40 minutes to wander through the lovely gift shop and nature displays. Very well done. The tour to Frozen Niagara area in the cave is reached by a short bus ride. It is a very easy walk inside the cave area. So sad to see the human results in the way of broken stalagtites and graffiti.

Mammoth Cave,"My girls and I traveled to Mammoth Cave last week, and found that the park was great with the hiking and such....However, in my humble opinion the cave itself is being desecrated by all the human traffic and movement in the nearby areas. They have paved a walking area in the Historic Entrance which just seemed so unnatural and almost sad to me. I wanted it to be more authentic. I wanted to see less of the effects that we humans have had and more of mother nature. In the surrounding woods, there are beautiful trails on which we spent hours! The old Cut Off area was the neatest and most natural place I found. I loved that there were bats living inside and I loved that people were not allowed anywhere near the entrance and it was posted not to move anything or change the environment in any way at that location.I want to add that we were scheduled for a tour of the Niagara Room and another area but cancelled and ate a $3/ticket nonrefundable fee which did not bother me one bit. I was glad to get a partial refund and not leave feeling like my footprints were left inside something that should be so beautiful and untouched but is not that at all. Do not eat at the cafe inside the back building of info area, the food was disgusting and there were two flies flying around while we were eating and no we did not bring them in with us! haha. It was just subpar food and service. Not discouraging anyone from visiting Mammoth, just be aware the cave itself is much changed due to the stamp from human traffic.","October 25, 2016","Great hiking, too much commercialization and traffic in caves though!",3,"Avon, Indiana",1
Mammoth Cave,"My husband surprised me with a trip to Mammoth Caves this past weekend. On the drive there, i was researching tour options and we decided on domes and dripstones. We bought our tickets while we were driving, which was the day before our tour, and it's a good thing we did. They were sold out when we arrived the next morning. Unless you're visiting in the dead of winter, buy your tix in advance! The visitors center is beautiful. There's a very nice museum inside. Lots of info and an interesting 3D display of the cave system! The domes and dripstones tour lasts about 2 hours, but only an hour or so is spent in the cave. There are some low ceilings and narrow openings. If you're claustrophobic, this is not the trip for you! We saw Frozen Niagara at the end. Very impressive! The guides were excellent. They answered my questions and Kevin had a great sense of humor. It's crazy to think that tour only covers 3/4 mi of the 405 mi of cave down there!! Kevin has been thru 100 mi of it! Only 12 mi are open to the public. We also did the self guided tour of the historic entrance. The caves in here really display the ""mammoth"" size of some of the caves. My husband actually enjoyed seeing this the most. I would love to go back some day and try other tours!","October 24, 2016",Amazing caves!,282,"Massillon, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"I've only been to MCNP twice. Just got back from my second trip there today actually. If you're not camping in the area, then the only reason to really go to the park is for the tours. Something I seriously suggest doing. Prices for tours are stupid cheap.There aren't a whole lot of trails to be hiked. I frequent Gatlinburg and the GSMNP a LOT! There are still hikes I have yet to take there. Here, there really aren't too many more for me to take. This isn't a criticism on the park. I'm simply saying, outside of the cave tours, there isn't a whole lot to do (unless, again, you're camping there.)The park is beautiful. Especially in the fall. Trees were still green, however the reds, oranges, yellows and browns were beginning to crop up, which contrasted beautiful with one another. And the clear blue sky above? It's gorgeous to see. The real reason anybody goes is for the cave tours. My wife had never been on one. Heck, this was her first time there. We booked for the Self Discovery Tour (a short walk through the Historical Entrance and down to the Rotunda,) then followed it with the more serious and educational tour, The Domes and Dripstones Tour. I have done the Historical Tour, so my expectations were high. I was worried that this part might not be in this tour, or that part won't be in this tour. Well, they weren't, and it made it even better. Why have two different tours covering the same thing? Traverse down 280 stairs to descend 250 feet below the surface. Very tight passages and low hanging ceilings require you to be alert the whole time. I busted ky head several times (much to my wife's enjoyment) because I was focused on my camera. Our tour guide, Ranger Larry was very professional and fun. We all laughed at nearly all of his jokes. Very informative and educated. Granted, I can imagine these guides go through a strenuous training course which includes learning everything, ultimately having to learn from a script. If there is a script, Ranger Larry did not need it. He presented the tour in his way, and in his style.The tour itself was beautiful and it ends at the Frozen Niagara. So if you plan on doing that tour, switch it for the Domes and Dripstones tour instead. It would make for a much better experience.No flashes of any kind, so be sure to adjust your camera's setting to be in night time mode, or to at least auto detect it.It's fun for everyone, however, read the warnings on their website. Back problems, heart problems, any sort of physical condition which may make walking up and down stairs (500 in total) almost impossible, you'd may want to sit this one out. Keep kids close to you. There are railings which, when over looked, reveal a very deep black hole. At least a 90 ft drop. It's fun for the kids, but make sure they aren't having TOO much fun please.Our trip to the park has possibly started a new tradition for my vacationing family for when we head down to Gatlinburg: book a night in Cave City, do a cave tour, then hit the road again. It's a national park that should be experienced. Don't miss it!","October 23, 2016","A beautiful, inexpensive national park rich in history",24,"Cincinnati, Ohio, United States",5
Mammoth Cave,"There are so many different hiking trails and cave tours at this park that you will easily find one that suits you or your family. We had young children so we opted to just take the self guided tour option. It was perfect for us. We definitely would've done a longer tour with older kids and feel like we probably missed out but it wasn't an option for us.

Mammoth Cave,"We took the Mammoth tour because a 90-year-old was a member of our group and the other tours recommended for her physical capabilities had already sold out. I was a bit disappointed. There was some construction underground (refurbishing the walking paths) and, unfortunately, the tour we chose didn't show as much of the cave as we had hoped. I would like to return to take advantage of the self-guided walks & other tours that show more/different parts of the cave. The visitor center was well staffed and the several gift-shop areas had a nice selections of souvenir items. I thoroughly enjoyed the displays about the history of the people and the physical geography of the cave system itself.

The only part we could see was the self-guided tour (about 30-45 minutes). Everything else was sold out for that day as well as the following one!

Mammoth Cave,"We took this tour with our 10 & 12 year old. We all enjoyed the 2 1/2 hour tour. It does have 504 stairs, there are tight spaces, you will encounter spiders and crickets on the walls, but it is so great! If you are claustrophobic, can't handle stairs, or can't navigate tight spaces then this tour might not be for you. There were some younger kids on our tour who were crying by the end, so keep this in might as well. The views and information by the rangers are phenomenal. I would take the same tour again, because there's too much to see and not enough time. This tour exceeded my expectations.We ate lunch at the hotel and then decided to go on the self guided tour just so we could see the old entrance to Mammoth and a big cavern. Be sure that if you want to go on something other than the self guided, you will need reservations ahead of time. We went on a Friday morning in October and it started filling up quickly the day before. By the time we arrived in the morning, all tours had been sold out for the day.","October 18, 2016",Domes and Dripstones!,84,"Plainfield, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"We arrived right as a tour was getting ready to leave so we didn't have the time to read over the different types of tours available, as there are multiple tours. The tour leaving was the Domes & Dripstones Tour, so that's the one we took. From the Visitor Center we boarded a bus which brings you to the entrance of the cave. It was a great tour, we had a very personable and knowledgeable tour guide (I believe his name was Bob) but I was disappointed that we did not enter in through the ""Historic Entrance"" as I am a huge fan of caverns and entering the cavern is part of the cave experience. I do believe they have a tour that enters through the historic entrance but at the time it was under construction. We instead entered through a single door entrance with tight twisty stairs descending immediately. Be aware that the stairs are wet, narrow in a lot of spots and the rocks jut out in various spots so watch your head, wear comfortable shoes suitable for the activity. A majority of the cave is unadorned limestone with only the very end of the tour featuring stalagmites and stalactites, but our tour guide was informative and entertaining and the tour was great from start to finish. You can take pictures but WITH OUT flash so prep your camera ahead of time as it is difficult to do so in the dark and walking down steep steps fussing with a camera is not a great idea and you will miss out on the cave experience. We did not explore the park any further as we were on our way to Louisville, KY but what we did see was very beautiful, would love to return and hike some of the available trails. There are 2 gift shops! One gift shop is at the hotel adjacent to the Visitors Center and a gift shop also available at the Visitors Center. You can get a Squished Penny near the Hotel gift shop and you can get your Passport Book stamped at the Visitors Center gift shop.

Glad we went the evening before to book our tickets for the following day's tour as they were selling out quick. There were three buses of people on the tour we did. So, not much individual storytelling going on during the tour. So, in that sense we liked the NP cave tours in SD better. But, don't get me wrong, the caves are fabulous. There was a lot of walking and stairs up and down(500) on the tour-Domes & Dripstones we did.

Make sure you plan ahead and have your tour reservation well ahead of time (they book quickly---even during the week---and sell out quite often). Don't be discouraged if you get locked out of one of the guided tours, there are self guided tours that can be done. When booking tours, make sure you clearly understand what physical degree each tour is!

We were disappointed that we couldn't get the tour we really wanted and surprised that almost all the tours for the next day were sold out. The tour was nice but they are conducting construction in the cave and the construction equipment and noise took away from the experience. We couldn't hear the guide and missed most of what he was saying during the tour. The cave is really impressive in size, but just as a note, lots if stairs to climb down and then back up again so not handicap or elderly friendly. And we were rather disappointed in the friendliness of the staff, not very welcoming. But the cave is worth seeing, if you take your earplugs for the jackhammers!

Mammoth Cave,"We had a great weekend visit to Mammoth Cave National Park. Totally worth our 4.5 hour drive to explore nature and the Kentucky countryside. Two important tips: book tours in advance to reserve a spot (nearly every tour on Saturday and Sunday was booked upon arrival. So I was glad we booked in advance) and remember the park is in the Central Time Zone. All tours leave from the Visitor Center, which is full of friendly and helpful rangers. The Visitor Center also has a small educational center and a souvenir store. Next to the visitor center is The Mammoth Cave Hotel. The hotel and nearby cottages are very underwhelming, but the hotel does have one restaurant where you can have a sit-down meal or order food to go. There are several hotels off of interstate 65 near the tourist attractions on the way to the park. We opted to rent a house at Nolin Lake (about 25 minutes away) because that suited our group of six the best. There are not many good food options in this rural area so adjust your expectations. We did a total of four tours: the Frozen Niagara tour, the Domes and Dripstones tour, the self guided Discovery tour and the handicap accessible tour. We learned that the second half of the Domes and Drip stones tour is identical to the Frozen Niagara tour. Each of the other tours showcased different geology of the caves. Do not skip the self guided tour as it was one of the best. We also visited the National Corvette Museum and the childhood home of Abe Lincoln. Plenty to do within a short drive.

Mammoth Cave,"I really enjoyed our visit. We took two tours - the Domes and Dripstone tour and the Great Onyx Cave tour. Domes and Dripstone gives you a nice overview of the park and you can really grasp how big the cave system is (405 miles and counting). Great Onyx is only offered in September and October, but it is fantastic. Great Onyx is largely unspoiled, which is really sweet. It includes some gorgeous formations. Great Onyx doesn't have electric lights, so the visitors carry Coleman lanterns. Word to the wise, make sure you are carrying a lantern or know someone who is. Lanterns go to every fourth person or so. I nearly fell in the dark because the woman who was carrying our lantern decided to run ahead and leave us in the dark. We also ate at the Hotel, and the food was really good - not institutional at all - and served by really nice people. If you are going on a cave tour, make sure to make your reservations online, or you may be out of luck. The tours fill up really quickly.","October 16, 2016",Really Great Park,85,"Hillsborough, North Carolina",5
Mammoth Cave,"Even if you are not interested in (or can't get a reservation for) a cave tour, this park has plenty to offer above ground. There are lots of beautiful hiking trails for every fitness level. They have a large picnic area with grills and fire rings. We were the only visitors using a fire ring on an October 70 degree Saturday night. As others have mentioned, it is best to make tour reservations in advance as they often sell out. We did the 2.5 hour Cleaveland Avenue tour. It was a little long for our interest level. You move very slowly through the cave and everything kind of starts to look the same. It could have been half as long.","October 16, 2016",Great park,82,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5

Mammoth Cave,"We went on a Wednesday afternoon & found the tours sold out for the day. After consulting a Ranger, we bought tickets ($15pp) for the 9:30AM ""Domes & Dripstones"" tour on Thursday October 13, 2016. The description tells you what you'll see, how long the tour is (2 hours), the distance (.75 miles) & how many stairs there are (500). The difficulty is 'moderate'. Thursday we met at the designated spot. Ranger John (a former teacher) led the tour. He is a fantastic guide! He is tremendously knowledgeable, knows how to handle a large tour group (114 at a time) & funny. It's obvious he likes his job.Our complaint is that when Ranger John started the tour before we got on the 3 buses that took us to the cave entrance, he gave us a bunch of warnings:*There are spiders & such in the cave & they may fall on you (he went on to tell a personal story about something going down his shirt....).*You need to be on good health (it's only .75 miles but it can be strenuous).*Beware if you are claustrophobic because there'll be spots that are tight.*There'll be spots where we're up high, so if you're afraid of heights, watch out.Perhaps these disclaimers should be made BEFORE ticket purchase! What if you can't walk a mile or are afraid of bugs or heights?! Would they refund your money? (These didn't apply to us, but they may to some folks!)The tour was okay. Because of the large number of people in the group & the time schedule that needs to be kept, we felt like cattle, walking single file with no time to stop & take pictures or look around.It wasn't a particularly pretty excursion - we've seen much prettier. The ""Frozen Niagara"" part was nice but not spectacular.The tour itself was 'average', but because of Ranger John, we rated it as 'very good'.","October 15, 2016",What made this VERY GOOD was Ranger John ,27,"Carver, Massachusetts",4

The visitors center was informative and had a lot of information about the park But we found out that you needed to either book in advance or register for tours on the internet.

Now that we have returned to Mammoth Cave, the immense size of the rooms and sheer length of the passageways is in better perspective. Mammoth Cave is just that - Mammoth. You have so many options to tour an incredible variety of cave types and formations. Plus, the above ground areas are intimately connected with the underground areas through sinkholes, rivers, and natural cave openings. If you go (and you should!):- Book cave tours ahead of time to avoid sold-out tours- Take several different cave tours to see a variety of passageways, chambers, and formations.- The tours can be large with 100+ people. You will be rushed through the tour to stay on schedule, but the tours are still excellent.- Some tours require short bus rides from the visitor center to the cave openings.- Some tours have 100's of steps. Make sure you can do the tour before committing.- Do some hiking above ground- The campground is nice, but is first-come-first-served and has no connections.- There is a historic hotel near the visitor center.- There is no flash photography inside Mammoth Cave. Take a camera capable of low-light exposure if you want any memories. Or just buy the post cards.- Try some of the smaller regional, private caves outside the park where you can take flash photos.

So I definitely recommend booking as soon as you know your plans.I did managed to get a spot on the Grand Ave Tour. It is 4 hrs and covers 4 miles. The description lists it as very strenuous and I think the description of the number of steps, steep hills with uneven footing are reflective of the true condition. What they do not mention that I think is important in deciding if one if fit for this tour is the low light level. There were areas of hills and steps where I really could not see my feet in the darkness and w as gauging my next step on how the person I front of me bed.My guide, Ranger Rose, was excellent.

We only stayed one night, along with the preceding afternoon and following morning. I wish we had left more time to explore!The Visitor Center has a small (but dense) museum that gives a lot of history about the cave. There are plenty of tours to choose from, but they sell out quickly, even in the ""off-season"", so book ahead. We did the Domes and Dripstones tour, which was very different from other tours we've done. The tour group is almost 120 people, which we were afraid would be too large. This meant that we'd walk through a section of cave, then only stop when we got to a large room with benches so that the guide could talk to everyone at once. We would've much preferred a smaller tour with the flexibility to stop and talk about things along the route, but it was still an enjoyable experience thanks to a great guide.We were only able to explore one trail near the hotel due to our limited time, but I wish we would've built in at least one extra day so that we could do the other trails in the area - they look amazing, and they're one of the reasons I'll want to come back in the future.","October 11, 2016",Wish we had more time!,74,"Fenton, Missouri",4

The cave offers the thrill of adventure in its extensive avenues where you can see colorful stalactite and stalagmite formations, large cavern rooms, and spectacular pits and domes.You can experience the fascination of seeing, the beautiful gypsum-covered Snowball Room 260 feet underground. Rich in history, geology and natural beauty, Mammoth Cave is one of America’s most famous attractions. The cave may be visited every day of the year, except Christmas Day, and is equally enjoyable in winter and summer since the cave temperature (approximately 54 degrees) fluctuates very little with the seasons.Remember to explore the top of mammoth Cave too. With 80 square miles of forested hills and bluffs, 30 miles of scenic river, and 70 miles of trails, you will find countless opportunities for walking, hiking, canoeing and boating.1814 marked the beginning of the hotel services at Mammoth Cave near the historic entrance where Mammoth Cave Hotel now stands. Bring your camera, good walking shoes, imagination and excitement and prepare for an adventure of a lifetime.Dr. Marc PS 63:7","October 10, 2016","For the Want-To-Be Explorer, Now’s Your Chance",301,"Franklin, Kentucky",5
Mammoth Cave,"We had a great time at Mammoth Cave. We stayed at one of the Woodland cottages in the park. They are very basic, but nice. I wish I had thought to bring a small electric space heater since it was cold when we woke.up.in the mornings, but I would stay again.We did the self-guided tour and the Great Onyx lantern tour. We enjoyed both and would recommend both to families with small children. Our kids are 4 and 10. Neither had any problem keeping up on the tours.","October 10, 2016",Amazing caves,2,,5
Mammoth Cave,"I am a huge National Park fan but I am not sure I agree with this park as qualifying for the NP in front of it. I would agree with National Monument.I decided to go on a whim the night before. I booked the Domes and Dripstones tour at 9:30 am for $15 and 2 hours in length. I traveled north through the beautiful state of Kentucky (no I am not from here). My GPS did not give me a problem. It was mentioned on the national park service website that some GPS sent people all around the bend and missed their tour as a result. Some even ended up on a ferry! You may want to review what they have to say before you go. I got off exit 48, turned left and traveled for about 3 miles. Came to a tee, turned left and traveled for another 5 miles. This dead ends right into the visitor center and Mammoth Hotel along with some yellow cabins.Right before the visitor center is a camp store with a minor but sufficient selection. The post office, laundry and showers were in back and looked clean and inviting. I visited the post office to get my cards stamped 'Mammoth Cave' and bought beef jerky and milk from the camp store. I thought the prices to be the same as Walmart for this purchase, but I thought the jerky was not very good. I think as most people know, there is NO GAS inside national parks or monuments so fill up before you get off the exit. We had two rangers and 50 people on our tour. We left promptly on two buses to the entrance. The first ranger gave a talk and then led us in. It was now 9:51 am. We had descended some stairs before the entrance but now we would go WAY DOWN on stairs that were about 18 inches wide. I am 5'9 and only had to duck a few times. I wore a fanny pack and that got stuck once or twice as I had to maneuver through rocks that sometimes appeared to be holding each other up. I never felt any danger - just to be clear. The hand railings were dripping wet. It was a steep decent and I held on with both hands and thought I should have brought rubber gloves to grip the railing better.I was the last of three people straggling behind but I never had an issue with knees or being out of breath as it was all the way down with maybe 8 steps up before we came to a large seating area. By this time (10:08 am), the ranger was already talking and I did feel a little miffed that he could not have waited. After all, the tour holds something like 110 plus people. Do they just wait till the first 40 some people get there and then leave the rest out every time? Anyway, he talked for a while. I think we left around 10:13 am. It was going up but not bad. There were several places with no stairs just a rolling up or down walkway. Shortly we arrived at yet another seating area - like 10:25 am. The first ranger was already talking again when we arrived and I think that was another 8-10 minutes. We finally got to the end of the tour which is also the FROZEN NIAGRA tour portion. I took the optional 49 steps down and 49 not optional back up. That was worth the trip down. On my way out, the second ranger was having show and tell about the beetles and crickets on the ceiling which I think the one of three beetles can only be found in this cave. It also has no eyes.One lady from NY said what I was thinking about half way through - ""I am kinda disappointed"" she said to the ranger in back. The domes and dripstones are at the end of this tour and are nice but I have seen better at national monuments like the Oregon Caves. This cave is called Mammoth due to the length of the cave - 450 miles if I remember right and it is the longest and most studied in the world. Don't get me wrong, it was a good tour but I just cannot rate it a 5 star. They have a lot of tours which are given different times of the year. I wanted to take one big tour - Cleaveland tour which is 4 hours long - but it was not available on September 1 but came available either during or right after Labor Day. Kids of all ages would love any portion of Mammoth because it is a CAVE and I do not feel it would be dangerous for them.The buses were waiting, but they do not leave at the same time. They leave when one fills up. We went to the hotel where we were dropped off for a foot bath of spongy Woolite to remove debris and helps with white nose syndrome... not sure why we did not do this before as well. They say on the website that the cave is around 60 degrees Fahrenheit in summer but I was sweating and so were a lot of other people. I did wear a jacket which I took off many times. Other people wore shorts and long sleeves and they were fine. This is not like other caves where my jacket was needed. The winter may be different.I took indoor photos and my best were simply using night portrait instead of the ISO 1600 which I could not keep still because mono-pods and tripods are not allowed in the cave. Also, as you guessed, no FLASH allowed. Of course, I had to utilize the light provided in the cave, but again, not too shabby pics. I have posted a few.If I had it to do over again, I would email Mammoth Nat'l Park on the NPS website and ask them which tour would offer really huge caverns. I bought a post card which had a monstrous cavern but forgot to look on the back which tour it was on. If I only wanted to do the National Park, I would do that tour and the Frozen Niagra which is 1 hour and 15 minutes and super easy....BUTOn the way out (on the same 5 mile stretch and inside park boundary) is Diamond Caverns. It is $17 per adult for a one hour tour totaling a 1/2 mile. I read where this was real gem of a cave. I visited the website (diamondcaverns.com) and after I saw what they had to offer from the gallery, I would have taken this tour instead of domes and dripstones. I still would have supported Mammoth National Park by doing the Historic Tour which was one offered during the time I went which I know I could have physically done. Of course, if you are a real spelunker, you are in luck as there are caves abound outside the park as well.So, if you had say 4-5 hours and wanted to do only caves, go to Diamond Caverns for beauty and do a tour at Mammoth where you could see HUGE caverns.SHOPPING: two gift shops in the hotel and two in the visitor center. Fine crafts were in the hotel. They also had vending machines in the hotel: $1 for soda, $2 for water. I think snacks were $1. Check out the new National Park games: Yahtzee, Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit. Yahtzee and Trivial Pursuit are compact and make great travel games. Diamond Caverns had a wonderful gift shop filled with beautiful rocks and overall great unique souvenirs. In the fall, there are plenty of trees and trails which I am sure would light up any trip. You can't go wrong with at least a FULL day at Mammoth National Park. Since it rained on my trip, I went back down to Bowling Green (30 miles away) and visited the Corvette Museum. A great place to end the day for me.","October 9, 2016",Domes and Dripstones,471,"Gatlinburg, Tennessee",3
Mammoth Cave,"I've been to commercial caves and found the NPS experience very interesting. I liked learning about the geology and conservation efforts, cave wars, bats, and the history of the caves. It was nice not to have to deal with all of the gimmicks some of the commercial caves. I would recommend getting tickets in advance for the tours. We had done that but saw many people turned away because the tours were sold out the entire weekend we were there.","October 9, 2016",Great place to see and learn about caves in a natural setting,18,"Pleasant Valley, New York, United States",5

Mammoth Cave,"Be ready to travel underground... you are not coming to Mammoth Caves to NOT get into the earth. So, if you are afraid of the dark, tight spaces, critters, or have just watched too many scifi movies, be prepared. And dress accordingly - no flipflops, bring a jacket!For those that are ready, prepare to see some of the most expansive, extensive caves you will ever see. These things are huge. And sure, they might not be the most beautiful caves you have ever seen... but if you start to grumble, remind yourself, you are underground in a cave system so large that some rooms can fit the Statue of Liberty. I have no idea what a summer tour is like here - I made the decision to travel in the early fall and it was perfect. The crowds were lessened and you got the option of longer hikes the the caves. Me? I took the Grand Avenue tour to see just about everything the park offered... The park warn you before the tour that its extremely difficult, but if you can hike 4 miles - you are fine.","October 4, 2016",They Don't Call This Place Mammoth For Nothing!,101,"Arlington, Virginia",5
Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I visited for a few days in September and went on two tours. The first was Grand Avenue Tour which includes the entire Frozen Niagara Tour route and all of the Domes and Dripstones Tour. The NPS web site depicts the difficulty as ""very strenuous"" but I'd say it's closer to moderate (and I'm not in the best shape). It was 4 miles long and we finished in 4 hours, but don't let that scare you! However, if you have balance issues, you may want to pass on it; we had a couple of people on our tour who kept losing their balance...which can be dangerous in a cavern.The second tour we took was the Great Onyx Lantern Tour which was 2 miles through caverns that are not connected to Mammoth Caves (but the tours are run by the NPS). This tour was fascinating! The Great Onyx Cave was privately owned until the 1960s and the owners took great pride in keeping it pristine. The only real improvement was the path through the cave. There are no lights (hence the Coleman lanterns) so you get a real sense of what the people who found it experienced.We had a great time and will probably return one day to see more of this unique park.","October 3, 2016",Incredible Caverns,60,"Punta Gorda, Florida",4

Mammoth Cave,"The park service is doing a nice job of educating visitors via letting them see the cave firsthand. They oversold our group so the 40 swelled to 50 and the passenger bus used for travel to the cave was insufficient. They were quick to cover the error with another bus and at the cave another Ranger just finishing his shift volunteered to stay on with our Ranger to assist the larger group.Our Ranger's voice was good and loud but it did not carry well enough to reach past 50 people, many not near her and some of which were chatting.They did a nice job of informing people what they could expect inside the cave and in most cases gave options. BUT if you don't hear well, stay close to the guide.","October 1, 2016",Going underground but not incognito.,11,John Day,4
Mammoth Cave,"If there is one National Park that has to be on your list, this is the one. Easily accessible from Interstate 65, the park is very well maintained and offer lots of different activities above and underground. We did not do much of the hiking trails but for what we saw there is trails for everyone. As for the underground well you could explore for hours and hours. We started withthe historic entrance self guided tour, very impressive byt the size of the rooms, the ceilling look like ballrooms ceilling it is very beautiful. Easy of access this will give you a good idea of what is next. We took the Domes and Dripstones (Separate review) I think this is one of the best one give you a 2 hurs tours from the new entrance to the frozen niagara. I have to say this was one of the greatest experience i had to walk deep into the caverns for miles was breathtaking. The beauty of the formations, the history simply amazing. On the practical side wear a good pair of walking shoes or hiking boots, a light jacket is recommended but mor importantly take the time to immerse in a new world.","October 1, 2016",Amazing undergroud exploration,113,"Franklin, Tennessee",5
Mammoth Cave,"Its BIG.....very BIG....and very crowded. Well at least it was when I was there. I went on a friday and half the tours were already booked. Over 100 or so folks in the tour. (three bus loads) The tour I went on was domes and dripstones. Its about 2 hours with a bus ride to and from the cave entrance. Even though it was a fascinating site of such vastness, long tunnels and walkways I felt like I was running through the tour to keep up. It was hard to stop and really look at what we were walking through. We had 3 stops where we sat for like 5 mins to hear history. But much of the time we sat waiting for all the group to get into the room for the talk. The guides were awesome and I felt for them having to deal with folks that don't pay attention, listen or don't follow the rules. Of course he was very tactful in stepping on others toes. He asked for folks to not touch the rocks inside and well guess what folks were touching. Parents were not watching their kids in fact one kid turned the lights out in the cave (people were screaming) and the parents thought it was cute. Duh. This tour didn't have any great formations just some big wide open 'rooms' which was limestone but the vastness of it was mind boggling. It did take us through the frozen niagara area which had lots of formations. If you like crowds be prepared. Maybe going during the week might be less folks.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave is certainly one of the icons of National Parks. We have visited previously although not is several years. The park is greatly improved. More tours have been added so there are plenty of options to consider. I would very highly recommend reviewing the parks web site for tour options, times and prices. The tours often are sold out and it is suggested that you plan in advance and if possible book in advance to avoid a possible disappointment. We did 2 of the tours and I was at the entry door 0715 for the 0800 opening. The lantern tour we desired, it is only done 2 months of the year, had only 16 spaces remaining and those would be sold on a first come basis when the park opened the next day. Yes I got our 2 tickets and the wait was worth the extra effort. There is plenty of free parking, including RV, bus and large truck accommodation, but get there early.

Mammoth Cave,"Good for elderly. Somewhat biting otherwise. Definitely easy to walk,have to duck down in a couple of places. A good bit of the tour time is taken by the Ranger talking and the ""short bus ride"". Don't bother taking a real camera, it is to crowded to try to hold a camera steady enough. A phone camera works best. You don't get to walk much more than 100 yards into the cave and the best sights ate by taking the optional 49 steps. Even at the bottom of those there isn't much room and your time at the bottom is rushed by the Ranger. Overall I was underwhelmed with this tour. The photos I included are pretty much the tour.

The cave is one the most natural and preserved caves, that is toured by the public. The tour guilds were great and very knowledgeable.  This is one National Park you must vist and see. There are several different tours you can do.  The tour has lots of walking and some steep stairs. The ground is slippery and wet; in several sections. The cave is cool around 54 degrees. You should be free of major health issues and have good legs.  Also there are no bathrooms at the cave site. Bring a bottle of water. You will love this trip and remember it for years to come.

We were fortunate to be in a small grouping about 20. The guide, Ranger Charlie, was interesting, knowledgeable & pretty funny, but serious that this was a somewhat strenous 2 hour event. We were bussed to the entrance of this section. There are amazingly deep holes in the cave, some huge caverns (the domes) & some wonderful examples of formations in this cave. From beginning to end, it was just two hours. It is chilly & damp....wear or bring a light jacket & wear shoes or boots. No flash photography is allowed but ki got some decent pictures w my phone.

Mammoth Cave,"I recently visited Mammoth Cave and took the Domes and Dripstones Tour with my friends and their 5 year old son.The tour was well organized and the guide Bobby was very informative and entertaining. I really enjoyed the history and geology about the cave system.The tour was also the perfect length for a five year old. There are quite a few stairs going down, but not as many going up because you leave the cave in a different location than you enter which is at a lower elevation. I will definitely return and do another tour,Perhaps one of the longer tours. Also we went on a Monday and there were about 30 people on our tour. Our guide said the same tour had over 120 people on Saturday. So I would suggest visiting during the week instead of the weekend if possible. ","September 27, 2016",Great Cave tour,13,"Moab, Utah",5

The cost is very low, for a senior with a US Parks Senior Pass, It was less than I paid for a hot dog the next day. This section of Kentucky is beautiful with rolling hills, mountains and man made lakes. The Caves offer 3 tours and should be scheduled in advance - they are limited and sell out fast. If you are in poor health, have difficulty walking 3 to 4 miles or are afraid of dark confined spaces - limit your visit to the above ground Park.

Mammoth Cave,We were in Western Kentucky to attend one of the college football games and decided to take a few of our 4th grade football players including my son to see the Mammoth Cave. Now I will say that you are going there and do not know exactly how to get there to print off directions or have your phone in offline mode. Because as you get up into the park the trees blocks off the Wi-Fi. When we got there it was 530 online it states that the park closes at 6. The disappointment for us was that it did not state that tours would stop a half an hour before closing. For this to be such a huge part I believe that this such things should be open earlier in 12 and close later than 7 at least till 8 expecially for those who travel far like we did to see such an amazing place. So we didn't get to go down to the cave which was so cold but amazing. Then we took the trail around and came to a bit of a waterfall but I'm going to guess because of the lack of rain the water was not following but really LOL. The scenery was amazing the work for us out of shape parents was crucial but the children loved it and wore them out. There are so many different sites to see around this amazing thing I hope that we get to plan another trip in the future and take advantage of it all.,"September 26, 2016",What a hike,0,,4
Mammoth Cave,*Please note that the park is in the Central Time Zone. We noticed this confused some visitors.*We chose to do the 'Domes and Dripstones' tour. If you're debating about what tour to do we can offer this perspective:The Domes and Dripstones tour is an extended Frozen Niagra tour in our opinion. If you just do the Frozen Niagra tour you see the best portions of the Domes and Dripstones tour. You are not missing anything we would consider a 'must-see' if you do the Frozen Niagra instead of the Domes and Dripstones tour.With that said if you don't mind stairs and have the time we still recommend the Domes and Dripstones tour as we enjoyed seeing more of the cave on a longer tour. Below is an overview of the tour:We met at shelter B and took the the bus ride to the cave entrance. The first part of the tour is descending down 200+ stairs. This can get a little tight at times and is steep. However it is very interesting to see how the constructed a staircase through this narrow section of cave. Once we reached the end of the stairs everyone sat on benches in a large 'room' in the cave and the guide explained more about how the cave was made. From this point until the Frozen Niagra formation the cave is pretty much the same with few formations. Once we reached the Frozen Niagra the rest of the tour was amazing with many formations. You have to see it for yourself to understand. The whole tour is about 2 hours long. ,"September 25, 2016",Another Great National Park,26,Michigan,5
Mammoth Cave,"Get here early or reserve your tour online, as they fill very quickly. We didn't take a long, guided tour...just the Discovery Tour ($5) through some of the first, main 'rooms' within the cave. There is a downhill walk to the entrance, which is worse on the way up if you're out of shape. There are benches along the walk if you need to rest. Shade trees cover the walk too. The cool air from the cave entrance is neat but you get used to it pretty quickly once inside. You can't use flash cameras inside. The massive rooms are impressive and informative tidbits along the way. The park employees were all very nice and helpful. Parking was fine. Drive to the cave was along very curvy roads. Souvenir shop and visitor's center was very nice and worth the walk-thru to learn more about the history of the cave system. We will probably come again to do a more extensive tour.","September 24, 2016",Longest Cave in the World,23,"Omaha, Nebraska",4

Mammoth Cave,"We arrived at Mammoth Cave, not knowing which tour we wanted to take (we had taken the Historic Tour in the past but it was closed for repair to the trails). We chose the Domes and Dripstones Tour. It was a two hour tour. We boarded a reconditioned school bus (no air conditioning) for a 10 minute ride to the entrance of this part of the cave. The rangers were so informative and explained why there were other entrances to Mammoth Cave. Once we got there we walked down about 300 steps in some very narrow areas. I would recommend sturdy walking shoes (we wore our hiking boots) because the trails and the steps throughout the cave can be slippery at times. The rangers did a great job of walking at a pace that everyone in our group could handle. There were a couple times that we could sit down and ask questions as well. When we got the the Dripstones Tour (Frozen Niagara), we were able to walk down another 50 steps and then back up again and able to get close to the stalagtites and stalagmites that form Frozen Niagara. All in all, a very informative tour and if you are a senior, you get half off the price with the National Parks card. Because or the time of year (September) there were only 2 children on the tour. Most of us were retirees. There is also a great visitor center with informative information about how the caves were formed.","September 23, 2016",Domes and Dripstones Tour,87,Columbia City IN,5

They have a wonderful visitor's center with a nice gift shop that offers a Veteran's Discount. Here you can purchase tickets to all the various cave tours that MCNP has to offer. For our first adventure, we all decided to do the walking tour on the hiking path, which was free. The scenery is gorgeous! A very nice hike through the forestry with a great stop at an open cave. This was great because it was very hot outside and the cave provided a natural air-conditioning for us to cool off in. There is a lot of walking downhill & uphill - so be prepared for that. We went a bit off-trail on our tour. We came to the end of the first trail which was a wooden bridge. We hopped over the wooden bridge & went down to the cave. This was super cool because there was natural spring in the cave. This hiking tour requires moderate physical exertion. Nothing extreme, but one needs to be in good health to do it.

We got there around 1:00pm, and all of the tours were booked solid. So we just went down into the one cave. It was beautiful, awesome and dark all at once! It was very well lit, with little tripping hazards, but anyone with a mobility issue will have a problem with the stairs leading to the main room. After coming out of the cave, we walked the nature trails, (hint, make sure you have water with you at all times!). Remember, if a hill goes down...you must come back up! There is a museum that gives the history and even has it's own hotel!

Some families had younger kids who got really tired and cried a good bit. I would personally pick a shorter one for the little tikes. Ours are ages 9 and they did fine. The tour guides were very knowledgeable and nice. It was pouring rain so we didn't do any outside hikes or trails. They look fun though. ,"September 17, 2016",Worth a stop if you're in the area. ,14,,4
Mammoth Cave,"I spent ages reading reviews and reading tour descriptions and eventually picked this one because most of the other ones were booked already-- FYI BOOK YOUR TOUR WAYYYY IN ADVANCE TO GUARANTEE YOUR SPACE-- it was awesome and our Ranger Cory Fish was great, I asked him what his favourite tour to give was and he said this Cleveland ave tour or the wild cave tour (where you're crawling on your belly) this tour does start by descending 180 steps...

Mammoth Cave,"I believe that when you are close to a National Park, take some time to visit at some of the attractions within the park. We went to Mammoth Cave. It is the largest single underground cave. They said it was something like 400 miles in length. We took the basic tour. It is a short 3/4 of a mile long trek containing about 500 stairs. It was totally different in that I expected different sights, but it was amazing. The park ranger showed us what darkness is like. The ranger turned out the lights. Talk about dark. The park has other things to do, but this was what we wanted to see. I highly recommend the park to everyone. By the way, get the cinnamon roll in the hotel.","September 14, 2016",A trip into darkness,2,"St. Louis, Missouri, United States",5
Mammoth Cave,"We drove here on the way back south after visiting some relatives in Indiana. This is the largest cave system in the world. Book several weeks in advance as tickets for prime time slots will be taken if you wait until getting there to purchase your ticket. Next time, we will go on the exploring trek with a guide. Unfortunately our son was too young. I believe you have to be 16 to do this tour. Be sure to bring a sweatshirt. The caves get a little cool and bring good shoes. The rocks can be slick if wet.","September 14, 2016",Interesting Cave System,46,,5

Mammoth Cave,I've been here a few times over the years and I can't wait to take my 3-year-old son for his first time. It's amazing what you see in the caves! It may be a walk with winding crazy stairs but it's soo worth it. To see what happens underground and it's such a learning experience.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth National Park is a hidden gem in Kentucky. We were in Tennessee for a family visit and last minute made a decision to go to Mammoth. Wow what a great Idea that turned out to be.As Most national parks it is sprawling in size .The area has been replanted years ago with all native trees so the drive thru was beautiful. But as we drove thru I thought there was something missing. We arrived at the visitor’s center which was nice it had lots of space and information. The center also has a small walk thru time line of park history. The only thing really lacking was food service. There was only one place to grab a bite to eat in-between tours. , Our server made some suggestions on the menu since we were on a tight time line for the next tour. The food was good and service was fast and friendly.As I looked around I thought what is there to see? No giant monument, Towering trees or Spewing Geysers. The secret is under your shoes. We took two tours that day, The Mammoth Passage Tour and the Frozen Niagara. Both tours were guided by National Park rangers and were chock full of information, history and local lore. The cave its self is Mammoth (no pun intended) with over 400 miles of mapped cave to date. The passage tour is about a two mile hike underground. Where close toed shoes and maybe bring a jacket. It gets cold down there. Some of the hike takes you thru some tight spaces and low ceilings but everyone can fit thru. The Frozen Niagara tour takes you down approximately 350 feet below the surface and down a narrow winding stair case to the bottom. As you walk thru and listen to the rangers tell how the caves came to be and how the Park became a National Treasure, Take a real moment to realize where you are and the Grandeur of Nature's Power The National Park Service is a great resource of America, Take time to visit our Nation Parks and enjoy the Wonders of America.","September 13, 2016",The Wonders of the United States,25,"Coral Springs, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"I took the Domes and Dripstones tour. The guide, Autumn, was very good and explained how the cave was discovered and made accessible. The tour went through a number of quite cramped passageways, which was fun! There was always plenty of time for questions. Towards the end of the tour was the best, where you could see Frozen Niagra and lots of beautiful stalactites. There is a 10 minute bus ride to, and from, the start of this cave tour. Note that you can buy tour tickets online, but even if these are sold out, there well may still be tickets for the same time available directly at the park.","September 12, 2016",Domes and Dripstones Tour: Very worthwhile,70,Minneapolis MN,5

There aren't any fabulous structures anymore and this is a dying cave, meaning people have so intruded that the cave ecosystem is destroyed and no longer growing. It's still a cool tour.","September 11, 2016",Mammoth Doesn't Cover It,828,,5
Mammoth Cave,"While traveling from Louisville to Nashville, we had limited time to visit this great national park. We took the Frozen Niagara tour which lasted about an hour and gave us a great overview of what the entire cave might look like. The park ranger was extremely knowledgeable and very personable.

Mammoth Cave,"I'm only giving the park an average review based on our one-time visit. We did take the recommended 'easy' cave tour which was interesting but nothing we would not see in just about any other cave tour. We were picturing seeing giant rooms like we had seen in pictures but were disappointed to find that the 'Historic' entrance that we had envisioned was closed. I'm not sure if this is permanent and forgot to ask about it. In any case we entered the cave through a locked door and were guided on a 45 minute tour through relatively small caverns. Interesting but not 'Mammoth'. Out tour guide, Ranger Sue, was very friendly and gave us some interesting information. Overall the whole experience fell a bit flat. Partially due to spending the night at the Park Hotel Sunset Terrace rooms. These were very musty smelling (see my other review). We would have cancelled had we not made non-refundable reservations. The rest of the park looked very nice and would probably be a great place for camping, hiking and biking. But our only interest was the cave tour.","September 11, 2016",Stopped for and overnight stay and cave tour - disappointed :(,63,"Punta Gorda, Florida",3
Mammoth Cave,"I went to Mammoth Cave National Park and did Frozen Niagara tour. This tour is 75 minutes and not to hard to maneuver in cave. It is designed to be for older and less able people. The sights are great in the cave. The guide was very earnest and hard to understand her stories. There is nice visitor center. There are other tours that are longer so you have different choices. I highly recommend checking out. Lastly, did not realize there are over 400 miles of caves in the park.","September 11, 2016",Historical place with lot to see,161,"Nashville, Tennessee",4
Mammoth Cave,"We called for a reservation the day before and there was just one spot left on the early frozen Nagra tour. We arrived at opening time the next day and found that they do set aside about 16 tickets for walk ins. FYI the senior golden pass only gives you half off ($6.50) for just the one person owning it. The friendly woman at the desk did give me the discount also even though my husband has the pass. The staff at the cave center are above average in customer service. The man on the phone taking reservations nationally was just a jerk. Very condescending and rigid. His name was Cliff.The tour starts with a short bus ride and is very well organized. Our ranger guide was informative and pleasant. A previous reviewer is correct, there are a few wow moments, but the cave is not stunning. It is mostly a pile of damp rocks. But it is a 450 mile cave and everyone should experience it.","September 10, 2016",Very interesting,80,"Green Bay, Wisconsin",5
Mammoth Cave,"They say on their website that Labor Day weekend is busy. They aren't kidding. There was so many people. I would recommend purchasing cave tickets online before you arrive.

Mammoth Cave,"We had been to Mammoth Cave two different times, and liked it so much, we decided to come back. Each tour is different and well worth the time and money to see each one. We had a Senior Pass for the National Parks, so our tickets were half-price! The tour guides were just fantastic! Each one is friendly, knowledgable, and entertaining. Some of these tours are kind of tiring and long for older people and small kids. Please be aware that it is cold underground, like 50 degrees, so bring a jacket. Also wear sturdy shoes as the trails are uneven and sometimes bumpy.If you can, see the Great Onyx Lantern Tour. It is lit only by lanterns which the visitors and Park Rangers carry. It was exciting and so fun, but no small kids.Most of the tours start by taking you on a bus ride to the site., just a part of the tour.

Mammoth Cave,"magine a place where they keep exploring and mapping out more and more of a massive cave system. This is Mammoth Caves National Park. Currently they have 405 miles of cave system mapped, all within about 7-8 square miles. Some of the caves are not even on National Park property...and they keep finding more. If you are planning a visit, it will pay to visit the park website and see what their schedules are, what tours they are offering, and even purchase tickets for tours. Its always better to have your ticket than get to the park and find all the tours have sold out, with they do on weekends and holidays. When I visited, they offered a self guided tour through a small section of a cave, a historical tour through areas that have seen tours for 200 years, a tour called Domes and Dripstones which runs through a section of the caves a few miles from the headquarters, and a Wild Cave tour - which is a 6 hour tour through some areas that look amazing. The guides are awesome. Its obvious they have been doing these tours for quite a while. At the headquarters there is a hotel, restaurant, snack bar, and lots of space for picnics, bikes, and walking. Trails are in abundance with so much to see and do. Overall great experience, I wish I could have stayed longer.","September 7, 2016","Come On, Go Explore a Cave!",69,"Los Angeles, California",5

We've visited a lot of caverns with stalagmites and stalactites, so were not disappointed when this turned out to be just a huge cave. The rotunda, named for the shape of this particular section of the cave, was impressive. There were park rangers located along the route to share interesting bits of information, such as how the cave was mined for minerals necessary to produce gunpowder during the War of 1812. Do be warned, there were a lot of steps getting into and out of the cave, and a pretty good incline back up to the visitors center. We were pleased with our visit and can check this one off the bucket list!","September 7, 2016",Labor Day Fun,25,"Pace, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave has a problem. The problem is that anyone who hasn't experienced a cave is going to expect what they see in the movies. A huge cavern with millions of stalactites, glittering crystals, and underground lakes. And sure, there is a bit of that here. But that is about 5% of the experience. The rest is a tour through a lot of brown rock. And sure, that sounds like I am minimizing it or making it sound not worth it. On the contrary. For someone like me that appreciates history and the natural world, this place is pretty cool. And until I visited I wasn't aware of just how much there is to do above ground. Hiking, camping, canoeing, etc. There is a hotel and a restaurant. There is way more here than the caves.The Visitor Center is the place to start. Here you can walk through a small museum to see a bit about how the cave has existed through history. You can choose your tour and board buses to the various jumping off points. Depending on what tour you choose you will walk. A lot. Up stairs, down stairs. Through narrow corridors. There will be moments of amazement.Just don't expect the caves to blow you away unless you can really appreciate the geology and history behind it.","September 7, 2016","Great Visitor Center, knowledgeable rangers, efficient touring.

Mammoth Cave,"Did not know what to expect. Arrived in the late morning. Follow the signs. GPS can be spotty in the middle of no-where. Did the drips and Cones tour. Nature, physics, chemistry, geology and time. God is perfect. He created habitats to include bats. We explored and walked and climbed and learned all day long. My first time in any cave. If you are claustrophobic, think about going on this tour. The Park Ranger/tour guide was excellent. Most of the Rangers are or were teachers so this is 2nd nature for them. It was 90 outside and around 55 degrees under the ground. You have no idea what is in store until the guide opens the metal door and everybody forms a line. All I know is we all had a great learning experience. Our ecosystems are so very delicate. God gave us all such a perfectly balanced planet. I just hope we don't destroy it. Enjoy your trip. You will love it.","September 7, 2016",Loved It,23,"Pontiac, Michigan",5

We probably should have spaced them further apart....Lol. As far as caves go this one doesn't have a lot of cool formations and such but in terms of size, holy smokes! The place was really busy labor day weekend but even the big tour sizes were fine. Be prepared though with a moderate tour covering 2 miles and climbing over 400 steps! There are easier tours so if it's not your cup of tea or you have small kids there's still plenty to see and do.

Mammoth Cave,"We enjoyed our visit to mammoth cave. We took two tours, The Historic, and The Domes and Dripstones. Both were very good, but also very different. The Historic is longer miles wise and has a few challenging points. The Dripstones was a little different, not as long, but does have a lot of stairs. If you had to choose one I would choose the historic. I found it to have more historical info and I like that kind of stuff. The mammoth cave is a dry cave so it doesn't have a lot of formations like you picture in caves, but it's still very neat in its own way. On the historic tour the main passage way is so large! It's amazing to see what water does to rock. This is the largest cave system in the world at over 400 miles of winding passage ways underground. Every year they discover more of the cave. We highly enjoyed our trip and will go back for more tours in the future. ","September 5, 2016",Really fun!,8,Tennessee,5

As a matter of fact I am looking forward to coming back as I loved this so much and would like to experience the other tours, especially the one you actually get to get some mud on you :) TIP #1: it's cold! I wore my flip flops and my feet got really cold. The terrain inside the cave is rough but doable for flip flops but it's really cold in the cave, and when I say cold I LIKE COLD but this is too cold, make sure to wear closed shoes or similar.TIP #2: we went for the most basic tour and it kinda felt ""short"" consider the distance we passed - I still loved it but main reason I would do it again is that this place is freaking huge and deserve more respect and time devoted to it, make sure to get to see some longer tours if time allows you - and be ready to book in advance, we haven't but sometimes different tours book up faster, especially the ""hands-on"" one which I believe it's called historical tourAll in all, unbelievable place - it's so enormous it almost makes you feel like it's fake or an UFO landed here from a movie set :)","September 1, 2016",No mammoths here but it's amazing!,374,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"We took the historic tour and it was great! The massive expanses are amazing, and people obviously spent a great deal of time in those caves many years ago; so it's perfect for history lovers. I believe they label this one 'moderate' and with good cause. I'm actually sick and had no problems going down into the cave. Coming up was a bit more of a challenge however, (maybe a couple hundred steps?), and my blood pressure was up by the time we surfaced. My husband and daughter were fine however.They frighten you with tails of claustrophobia and fear of heights. It didn't set off my claustrophobia at all. It became tight at the calves, or dropped to under four feet for just a few feet, but that wasn't bad. My daughter did experience a serious problem with the fear of heights however. The stairs at the end wind straight up. There are railings, so your never in danger of falling, but she didn't appreciate the beautiful views due to her fear.For us, one moderate level cave in a day was enough. We also encountered a young mom who must have carried her little one on our tour, and she was also exhausted. I'll definitely return however!","August 30, 2016",Quite an adventure!,7,"South Carolina, United States",4

I would not recommend these tours if you are claustrophobic. Also, there are MANY steps and the ground is uneven in places. I would recommend GOOD hiking shoes/boots.

Mammoth Cave,"Our GPS system took us to Mammoth Cave through the national forest via a lovely winding road. What a lovely drive! The day was overcast, so it made for a perfect drive. We came to a little ferry that took us over the Green River, a very tiny river. (I thought, what a fun job! At least for a day.)We took the Historic Tour, a two-hour tour from 10 a.m. to noon. We really did not know anything about the cave, so we figured this was a good place to start. We think there were around 150 people on the tour, so it is best to stay up near the guide if you want to hear what he has to say. Our guide also repeated things for those who were near the end and just arriving.There is a section near the end of the tour called Fat Man's Misery, and the biggest guy in our group made it through, so have no fear! (At this point, it is wise to hold onto the walls as it was a bit damp.)Due to the darkness of the cave, it is pretty pointless to take photos, so just enjoy.Here are some interesting things we learned. The cave is 450 miles long. There are three constants in the cave: temperature, no water, and humidity. During the War of 1812, it provided salt peter to make gun powder. The CCC (Civilian Conservation Corp) provided jobs to single men, 18-25 years old, during the Great Depression. Each person made $30/month and had to send $25 back home to his family. They used old WWI uniforms for their uniforms. The men each got three meals a day and full access to any medical needs.","August 29, 2016",What an interesting history to this place!,80,"Houston, Texas",5
Mammoth Cave,"Only took the Historic tour, but it was a good one. The cave is amazing even though you can only ever see a fraction of the whole cave. This 2 miles is less than 1% of the cave. The size of this cave is amazing and a must see if you have the chance. However, this is a dry cave, meaning it has a natural roof that is water proof , so there are very few interesting formations - at least on this tour. Still worth the trip down - this is not a tough tour if you are in good health. You will be warned if you are not in good health and pretty flexible then take one of the other easier tours. All that being said we much more enjoyed the trip to Diamond Caverns just a few miles away - it is an awesome cave with beautiful formations and a very active wet cave. Small tour sizes and much much more personal (no groups of a hundred) we had 7 in ours late in the day.

Mammoth Cave,"Amazing visit. Campgrounds offer limited hookups, but we did just fine. Note, showers take tokens (not quarters) and you have to buy them at the camp store (opened at 7) so if you want a 6 AM shower buy ahead! And the camp store sells coffee which was a happy relief. Cave is magnificent, beyond description. Take as many tours as you can, but research them first to avoid redundancy. My daughter took the Trog Tour where kids go off trail and loved it. It truly inspired a new fascination in geology and my motherly pride swelled to see her in coveralls and a hard hat. Visitors center is very well done. Restaurant is OK.

Mammoth Cave,"I have now been to Mammoth Cave National Park 4 times, and each time I have done a new tour and seen a different part of the cave. This time we visited as a family of 4 (8yr old son, 5 yr old daughter) and did the domes and dripstones tour (2 hr long) and the mammoth passage (1 hr 15 min long). The domes and dripstones was probably the best tour I have done on my 4 visits. We went through an active area of the cave and there were many beautiful formations and tall domes. It had recently rained and there was a lot of dripping going on during this tour. A lot of tight squeezes on this one. Even at 2 hours long, both our kids did fine as there were a couple of sitting stops along the way. The mammoth passage was a shorter and much less strenuous tour. This was a good tour for getting more history of the cave and seeing the large rooms that the cave is known for. As usual, the park rangers we met were helpful and friendly. Our kids also took part in the Junior ranger program and earned their badges at Mammoth (ask at the information desk). This is a wonderful program to keep the younger kids interested in learning more about the parks and to do their part to help preserve them.","August 28, 2016",many tours to choose from,5,"Milton, Wisconsin, United States",5
Mammoth Cave,"We were here two years ago and said we should bring our grandchildren back and ... at last we had the opportunity. We arrived via the Green River Ferry with was a fascinating arrival for us. Then we wound our way down the narrow staircase into the caves on the Domes & Dripstones Tour. Very popular tour and well organized with timed tickets, covered meeting area and bus ride to cave entrance. We bought our tickets online months before arrival. Quick and easy pickup. The kids were thrilled for the entire journey on this tour even when they turned out the lights for a brief time to see how dark it is. We had a quick picnic lunch under a tree near the parking lot and then went on the Historic Tour in the early afternoon. Again, the entire family enjoyed the historic sections and then the ""squeeze"" through Fat Man's Misery and Tall Man's Misery. Those were not a challenge for the kids but at 6'1"" tall I needed to keep ducking for many parts of the walk. No issue. This is a bit of a hike underground but interesting all the way back to the entry point. In the summer heat, it sure was a pleasure to enjoy the cool temperatures in the caves. Great tour guides for the large numbers of visitors. Restrooms in main building are very clean. Check out the small ""museum"" presentations about the cave formation and exploration in the main visitor center. The short film is very good. We will be back with more of our grandchildren.","August 28, 2016",Awesome,256,"Knoxville, Tennessee",5

Mammoth Cave,"The cave is awesome! We took the Domes and Drips tour and the self guided tour. Great for school aged children who are old enough to appreciate the natural wonder of the cave, the science, the history, and yet they get to move around the whole time.

Mammoth Cave,"Haven't been here since I was a kid! Still the longest cave system in the world, still pretty awesome! The visitor's center is large and runs like a well oiled machine. We did the Drips and Drapery tour, which is 2 hrs and moderately strenuous. I'm not in awesome shape and did just fine, even with the extra optional detour to see the frozen niagara, 100 more steps round trip. If one or two parts get you huffing and puffing, just make up a question to ask the ranger in back. :) There's a hotel and cabin rental, gift shops and a small museum that's very nicely done. Oh and several Pokestops and a gym. Go Blue team! The parking lot is huge. Be sure to do the shoe bath at the end to help them avoid spreading white nose syndrome to any other bats. Bathrooms were spotless. Both the cafe and the restaurant were closed between lunch and dinner which was surprising since they seemed pretty busy. We were in search of lemonade and maybe a stray french fry or two, but we were out of luck. The vending machines only took coins. Come here, spend all day! It's lovely - we saw bikers and hikers. The park around the caves is very pretty, as is the private property around the visitor's center. Take a map, don't count on any GPS in that tree cover!","August 27, 2016",Amazing,74,Michigan,5
Mammoth Cave,"Great tour! A couple of things to know though: 1) it is chilly and sometimes wet in the cave, 2) the staircase leading down can seem overwhelmingly tight (I began to feel panic)...hang in there! That's the worst part! Truly the way out did NOT have the same staircase! 3) the path has inclines, declines and stairs, very little straight flat paths, wear good shoes with good tread, 4) wearing a ball cap is not the best idea, walking the cave was a balance of looking down at the foot path and up to bend down under rocks (I'm 5'9"") so you don't bonk your head, the brim of my hat hindered my upward sight, 5) reserve your spot on a tour online before arriving, tours filled up, you still have to wait in line, bring your emailed receipt and they'll look it up and print off the actual tickets...remember, don't panic on your way down, I thought the stairs down into the cave made me want to turn right around and go back! Don't panic, those stairs are the worst part. I'm not a big person, but still had to turn sideways at some points of the stairs down.","August 27, 2016",Domes and Drip Stones Tour,35,"Kalamazoo, Michigan",5

Mammoth Cave,"It had been a particularly hot day, so going down into the cave was deeply refreshing. Caves maintain approximately the same temperature all year. It is cool, but not cold.We did a short tour because the others were too expensive. The tour was incredibly short and drawn out by the sheer number of people on the tour. Our guide, Spencer, was engaging, and he told is a great deal about the slave named Stephen Bishop, who explored much of Mammoth Caves.However, both of us would like to have taken a longer, less commercial tour where we could have seen more of a cave.We stayed at one of the park campsites, which was clean and orderly.

Mammoth Cave,"We planned a family visit to the National Park with our 14 and 8yr olds. The tours we went on were well guided. After taking the Violet City Lantern Tour, I was surprised about the ""difficulty"" warning. It is pretty much a 3 mile walk on some uneven ground. History Tour was also enjoyable, there were a few smallish passages to walk through, but nothing to bring on claustrophobia in the general population. Domes and Dripstones tour visits spectacular formations. It was a very enjoyable two days. The cave is always the same temperature, but if you do not like heat, I would suggest a spring or fall trip to be able to enjoy the surrounding area. I was glad that we did not stay at the park hotel. It looked rundown and boring.

Mammoth Cave,"Brought my 12 year old son on a summer road trip to Mammoth Cave, and wanted him to see some of the unique features of the caves in the area.We opted for the Domes and Dripstones tour, and it was a nice overview of the general features and history of the discovery of Mammoth Cave. Our tour group was too large (two busloads of people) to really engage with the guide - she was far up ahead and we were stuck behind a lady who stopped to take pictures every three seconds, and in front of a family of five, with three children whom the parents refused to control (I still have marks on the back of my foot where one child kept stepping on me and scraping my heel with his shoes - I finally said something to his Dad, who acted like I was some horrid wretch). Anyway, I would recommend this tour, as we learned a lot and enjoyed seeing the amazing area. It's pretty above ground, too. We saw two wild turkeys on the way in, along with a lot of wildflowers.

So we picked this park to help commemorate the National Park Service's 100th year.Let's start with finding the park. The NPS site says not to rely upon your GPS...so of course we tried. WRONG! Our GPS was having us circle the entire park. Having traveled half way we turned back and did what the NPS site said to do. DUH! The Visitor Center here is huge and beautiful. Nice way to start a visit! We had repurchased our tickets and got a 50% discount using our Senior Pass. We quickly got our boarding tickets and off we went!We took the Domes and Dripstones tour. As such, we were bussed about 5 minutes to the ""New Entrance"" for the park. There we began our descent into the cave.This cave is mammoth! It seems to go on forever (actually over 400 miles), but we only were in there for about 90 minutes. We loved Ranger Joel's way of explaining the geology and history of the cave. He made the tour just that much better.The first part of the tour is domes...taking you into several large rooms.

Mammoth Cave,"We were surprised that both tours were interesting, thinking that having done the Domes tour in the morning we would find the Historic tour less interesting, but that wasn't the case. They were both easy walks, and different enough that we learned and saw a lot on each one. Our groups were about 60 people and both went well. If you walk at the front of the group you can have interesting discussions with the ranger, as well as being able to keep to a steady pace. Youngsters tend to slow things down ... There was no place where it is difficult or really tight, so it shouldn't be strenuous for anyone who is mobile. Next time we will try the ""Wild Tour"".

As with most tours there are many stairs so be sure to wear good shoes.

Mammoth Cave,"We did the Niagara Scenic Tour because some in our group were not sure if they could do the Domes after watching a youtube video of that tour. So we did the Niagara, which is supposed to be the most awesome part of the Domes tour, and it was verrrry short. First you take a bus ride from the visitor center, for 10 minutes or so in the green school buses, then you basically walk in a door to enter the cave, then go the distance of a city block, look at the Niagara (which was nice), then you walk back out. These caves are not colorful, but if you choose a different tour, you will see they are long. On the Niagara tour there is one spot where you have to duck a bit if you are tall, but nothing at all that I would call claustrophobic, and we do have those types in our family. Go LAST in the group if you feel that way at all, and you will have a bit more space. Also the Niagara tour has less people in it, so that helps if you need it. All in all, this cave tour was too short, seems like you spend more time on the bus then in the cave. We did do some hikes above ground in the park, and highly recommend checking out any hike that goes near the Green River. The above ground hiking was up and down terrain, pretty, and nothing scary. Good break from driving in the car. Stayed in Louisville after, and that was an easy drive.","August 23, 2016","Niagara Scenic Cave Tour somewhat lame, hiking was decent.",135,"Orchard Park, New York",3

I recommend utilizing them with the codicil that if you go at the end of the season, many of the younger rangers are tired and a bit cranky. Persevere!!

Mammoth Cave,"I did the ""Domes and Dripstones"" tour. It was about as described on the website, a lot of stairs, climbing/walking through tight spaces, and beautiful formations near the end. There were two things that made it less enjoyable than it could have been: 1) People brought very young children (under 5) on the 2 hour tour and they (predictably) did not enjoy it so cried, whined, and talked loudly through the ranger narration and 2) the ranger narration followed more of a reality show type theme of the story of the man who discovered the cave and his disputes with the neighbors and lawsuits than it did with the geology of the cave. He also tried scaring people by mentioning that overhead rocks could potentially fall on them (and then said they wouldn't). I would have liked to have heard more about the geology and it seemed that others on the trip did too. We spent way too much time on those parts of the tour such that the tour behind us almost caught up with us and then we had to rush through the end where it was beautiful (and without any narration at that point).","August 22, 2016",Please leave your young children above ground,89,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",3

The tour took us on a two mile trek through the cave that brought us through rooms nearly the size of football field with 40 foot high ceilings to passages we had to squat to get through.

If you get cold easily, bring a jacket; it was also nice to have because in the tower it was very wet (it was rainy outside at the time). The only downsides of this tour were there were too many people so we couldn't always hear the guide and seeing how people write on the walls. The park itself was extremely busy!

It has moments where you can only get one person thru a tight opening. Fat Mans Misery is truly a fun conversation to have once you get out. There are moods to the cave. Go and go often, it is a unique experience. Its size is clearly the biggest cave I've seen to date. I would strongly recommend you also do the Domes and Dripstones tour also.

Mammoth Cave,"Just as the name says, the cave is truly mammoth. The 2 hour Historical tour will take a little physical stamina, so be aware. There is a long incline grade down to get to the cave entrance, then a long flight of steps when entering the cave itself. The inside temperature is about 54 degrees and humid. The cave floor is generally smooth but there are some uneven areas when going through the few narrow passages. The ceilings are high except for some very low areas through those narrow passages. Lighting is pretty good but expect to be looking at your feet since those lights rarely point down. If you are easily claustrophobic or don't like the dark, then maybe the cave is not for you. There are rest rooms about halfway through the tour. When exiting the cave, be prepared for several flights of stairs totaling 155 steps straight up. You will then be required to cross a wet, soapy pad when leaving the cave. Also after exiting the cave you will have that long upwards grade that you came down when entering.

That being said, You are stuck deep deep underground for a 2 hour walking tour. There is no way out but forward. There are portions that are very tight and very low & as if you are not tired enough after 1 hr & 45 minutes, you then have to climb about 10 flights of stairs to get out. The kids were troopers.

That is a good 2 hour tour. I was amazed at how complex the system is. I just had my fill by the end. If a friend tells me they are going to the area and ask if they should check it out I will say yes. If they say they want to go visit a National Park and ask for a recommendation, this would just not be at the top of my list.

Mammoth Cave,"I was here a long time ago & had such a great experience I wanted to show my kids Mammoth Cave. I was disappointed on this trip. Tour size is way too large & they go too fast. No photos using flash is allowed and not enough lighting to take otherwise. It almost seems like they are cramming people in and going that fast so they can make more money by the volume of people. If you have never gone in any caves before you will like it but again with the large groups and fast tours this will not be on my list again I'm sorry to say. That being said the cave is as the name implies Mammoth & an interesting experience with it so dim, but I wish it was more like I remembered and more lighted so that a person could actually see what they are paying for.","August 14, 2016",Not as good as 1st time here,9,"Madison, Wisconsin",3
Mammoth Cave,"I've been hearing about Mammoth Cave for a long time from family members. Finally made it there and I was rather disappointed. The tour went so fast that if you weren't up front near the guide you missed everything that was talked about. It was cool to hear about the history but I would have preferred more time spent on the landmarks the guide was showing us. Overall, I'm glad I went because I can say I went, but I don't think I'd bring my future children here. FYI, if you went there 20+ years ago, it is NOT the same as it was and there were many complaints amongst people 40 years old and older about all the changes, not necessarily for the better. Felt way more commercialized than it should have been. ","August 14, 2016","""Meh""",9,"Madison, Wisconsin",3
Mammoth Cave,"My family and I stayed for 4 days, did 2 of the cave tours and had an excellent time...the rooms were small but very nice and clean...we eat in a lot on vacation so a nicer refridgerator would have been helpful...we did a lot of biking and hiking...extra cave tours for the ones that are only offered 1 time per day would have been nice to be able to see more of the Cave...it was very hot outside so the cave tours were a welcome relief...","August 13, 2016",Domes and Dripstones Tour...,1,,5

This one has many steps on very precarious areas on sometimes wet steps, so WEAR NONSLIP SHOES,! the cave overall is awesome and the guides were very knowledgeable and entertaining. We had a very informative bus driver who gave us a lot if interesting history, even though he was only a driver, which I appreciated his narrative!","August 13, 2016",Domes and Dripstones,80,"Frankfort, Kentucky",4

Mammoth Cave,"There is a total of six tours. A visitor should make a reservation-this I didn't know-at least two weeks in advance. When checking admissions, at least two tours were already booked, so Domes & Dripstones was selected. Our group of 109-45 were third graders-at shelter B for a bus ride to the cave's entrance. Jackie, our guide, told the group what we would encounter during our one mile two hour tour. The ground rules were: NO drinks, NO Flash Photography & keep papers from dropping. The bus ride was 10-12 minutes to cave's entrance.At the cave's entrance are metal steps, which are 24"" at most & 10"" front to back. Don't be in a hurry if the person ahead is slow. The reason could be narrow passage way, steps & darkness for unseen rocks & low ceilings. The steps-250- lead to the cave's deepest point & the cave's first of two bench areas. At this point Jackie gave the complete of the cave-age, discovery & this is the earth's longest cave, at least 405 miles & counting.This is a CAVE, not a cavern. After the history lesson the group moved onto the next bench area on a smooth cement walkway along with a metal walkway with railing. Jack would let the group know well in advance of up coming low ceilings & narrow passage ways.Overall the cave id a DUD. No color, dark-many of my photos were dark or black, some photos I have no idea what I shot, just kind of light. No columns of stalactites/stalagmites. Only toward the tour's end were small stalactites. Where the name comes from is a mystery, as I saw no domes or any dripping stones. What I encountered was the moon's surface, just rocks & large boulders. The best footwear is a pair of quality hiking or work boots for traction. Forget flip flops, sandals & sneakers. With the temp a constant 54F wear a light/medium jacket. If a visitor is with a large group try to keep toward the front to hear the guide's voice. Because the group's size, another guide was at the group' end to make sure no visitor was left behind. The cave's best features are the excellent walkway & dryness.For the Domes & Dripstone tour I can only give two stars, that's for the walkways. The $15.00 admission wasn't worth the tour. There is a $5.00 self-guided tour, however this tour is shorter & seeing less. The parking lot is HUGE that will accommodate any size RV & truck. A counted eleven handicapped spaces. Two gift shops large & small. Use the facilities before any tour. Once on the bus there will be no facilities until back at the visitor center. My first photo was at 11:12, with last being 12:12.The Dome tour is NOT for a person with walking or health problems because of the steep steps at the beginning & total length of cave. There is not elevator.I suggest calling the park directly asking for a brochure, which will give all tours, pricing, tour length. Also ask about the reservations. The other tours are more colorful with stalactites & stalagmites.The visit was not a complete failure. Outside the visitor's center is the Heritage Trail, which is all forest, color & light. The trail is 3/4 in length, I only got about 1/4 or so, as my tour time was approaching. What I did view were information stands: Cave Airflow, a person is able down into a cave, A National Entrance-how water dissolves limestone to form a ravine, Historic Entrance-prehistoric people for this area & world travelers visiting Mammoth Cave following the War of 1812 & Gateway to the World Below-about people who lived here 10,00 years ago. The Trail was much more enjoyable than the cave.The park is off I-65, from the north take Exit 53-Cave City, from the south take Exit 48-Park City. I realize this review is long, I want future visitors not making the mistake I did. I am sure the other tours are what a visitor wants to see, not a pile of rocks. Domes & Dripstone is a complete waste of time & money.","August 12, 2016",Domes & Dripstone Tour.,483,"East Syracuse, New York",2
Mammoth Cave,"So if someone in your group is claustrophobic you may think to bypass this national park, but don't. The park doesn't have an entrance fee, you just pay for the underground tours. It has a nice visitors center and some trails. My traveling partner is claustrophobic so she opt'd for a ranger lead above ground walk which provided lots of great information on the history of the park, and she said it was excellent. I booked the Frozen Niagara tour (in advance) and it was perfect for a limited time, and paired well with the time of her above ground tour. That part of the cave is spacious, but there are a few tight spaces that could be a problem depending how much it might bother you. It's not like being in a elevator full of people though, as there is always space to move around, and you're always walking on the tour. A good tour for older people too.","August 11, 2016",Claustrophobic?,46,New York,4
Mammoth Cave,We spent one day at the cave and did the history tour and the Focus Formations tour. Both tours were great but had different goals. The history tour was about 2 miles and toured the cave with a lot of good information provided. We would do this one again but the cool formations were on our next tour. Our favorite tour was the Focus Formations tour. This group was small and they let us into an area and let us move around some on our own. This group is specifically for photography and I got some great formation pictures. Ranger Jason was awesome and very knowledgeable. After most of the people left the Ranger modified some lighting for us to set up better pictured. Great accent lighting so I could just use a long exposure. Glad we came on this trip.,"August 11, 2016",Great place to stop,123,"Eagan, Minnesota",5
Mammoth Cave,"There are all types of tours of different categories & starting times to choose from. We choose the Mammoth Passage Tour & I thought our choice was a bit strenuous for me, as I have asthma & there are lots & lots of steps & the size lives up to its name! I ended up @ the end of the group & took my time. Its history is interesting & our ranger guide was very knowledgeable. The children on our tour seemed to be fascinated with it all & didn't mind the steps, twisty turns, etc. Good educated fun for all. We went @ the end of May & most tours were booked, but we were able to do this tour without a reservation. I would highly recommend reservations, especially during school vacations.P.S.

Mammoth Cave,"We visited Mammoth Cave today from Cincy. We bought tickets for the Domes and Dripstones tour and the Historic tour in advance. We had the Domes and Dripstones tour first. It was a BIG group! They said faster moving people should stay toward the back so we did but it was so slow that it was painful. We'd take a few steps and then stand and wait for the line to move. It was way too crowded! The tour starts with 280 steps down. That wasn't a big deal. Don't sweat it. The space is super tight though and that did freak out one of our teens at first. If I had it to do over again, I would have chosen a tour with a smaller group. This was way too slow moving for our taste. There were times our heads were stuck hanging down for several minutes because the cave ceiling was so low and the line was standing still. Our teens were so spent by the time the tour was over that we skipped the second one and drove back home (almost 4 hours). The caves are truly fantastic but don't sign up for one of these big groups unless you want to move super slow and stand still the majority of the time. If you are used to trucking along like us, sign up for a smaller group tour even if you have to book it several weeks in advance. It wasn't cold down there btw. We brought sweatshirts but didn't put them on. It may be because of the crowd but it was a pleasant temperature with short sleeves and shorts. On a positive note, the tour guide, Allison was truly fantastic. ","August 10, 2016",Things you need to know about the tours! ,30,,3

You board a bus and are taken just a short drive away to enter this cave tour. Immediately you can tell the difference in the two tours. Very nice. Beautiful cave tour.

My son enjoyed it as much as I did as a kid & the wife and I enjoyed it tremendously even in our 50's.

That was a fatal mistake on my part. When arriving at 10:30, I found that all tours were sold out until 3 p.m. So if you want to get on a specific tour, book your tickets in advance no matter how many spots are available.Despite missing out on the intended tour, we were able to go on the self-guided Discovery Tour. It is only $5, so it's a great value just to get into the cave. However, if your goal is to see the awe-inspiring sights you've read about or seen online then this tour lets you down.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave National Park is the largest cave that is open in the National Park System, and it is big, I mean really big, 400 miles of trails. Our group took the Historic Tour that is about 2 miles in and out of the main cave entrance. The duration is approximately 2 hours. We learned about some of the early mining in the cave and settlement by the indigenous people. This cave was created by a sub-terranean river as opposed to stalactite and stalagmite formations in more dramatic caves.The beautiful outside areas of trees and open fields in starkly contrasts to the rock and dirt interior. With a few exceptions of the water dipping in the dome towers area, I found this cave to be very bland. However, geology students would be fascinated by the many visible layers of rock. The size of the tour group was too large and hard to keep the group together as there were individuals of various activity abilities. Often the front of the group would hear the ranger guides dialog but the rear of the group had hardly caught up as the presentation was completed. The path lighting also leaves something to be desired from a safety aspect.I have been in a number of caves and mines around the world and found this the least colorful. Carlsbad and Mt.

I had checked the website prior, and I really wish they would have suggested getting there at opening or at least explaining that all their tours may be sold out (somehow I doubt this was the only time this has happened...and on a Saturday). We bought tickets for the self guided tour since we drove all the way here. It was disappointing. My kids were disappointed and wanted to see more. I think it took us about 30 minutes to do the tour. We walked in, walked around and walked back out. It is a cheaper ticket, and I guess you get what you pay for. I was really disappointed and we turned around and left for our 2+ hour drive back.

Mammoth Cave,"Here's what you need: go to one of the short tours if you have kids. Wear a sweatshirt or long sleeves--even in the summer (it's cold in the cave). Take some time to walk through the museum and enjoy some of the facts--for instance, look at the handrail when you enter the museum and read how that is a replica of the length of the cave system if laid out in a straight line. Kids might not be so impressed, so get them excited beforehand by telling them how large the cave is and about the lady photographer who was made famous from her time in the cave years ago. You can do a little homework before you go and the kids will love it that much more. If you decide to do a longer tour, it is LONGER so be prepared for that. Overall, it's an amazing place. Stay the night and hike some of the trails around it. Maybe ask directions to go ride across the Green River on a ferry. There are a lot of hidden treasures around the area, have fun and explore!

Access to the cave is by tour only. Tickets sell out well in advance, so you are advised to purchase them online before arriving. Each tour consists of 30 or more people; you're lined up and ushered through, with very little time to observe, so that you're in and out in that hour and a half or two hours, although, as someone else noted below, there's not much to see. It really is more like an underground quarry. The size is, indeed, impressive. Their definitions of ""Easy"" and ""Moderate"" are based more on young, fit rangers, than seniors.

However very little of the cave has the ""drip"" structures that you might want to see in such caves. It is more like a mine with a lot of caved in structures. However it is still quite interesting and dramatic and worth visiting. Very important to allow time to get to the cave, as some routes involve a ferry that can take an additional half hour, and all tours require preregistration as booking is very busy.

Our guide was informative and interesting. Stay as close to him as you can if you want to get extra information. Though it was 90 some degrees outside, it was nice and cool inside the caves. In fact some people were more comfortable with a light jacket or sweatshirt on. After the tour we hiked around the park for a couple of hours taking in it's natural beauty.

Mammoth Cave,"We took the Domes and Dripstones tour of the cave. Before the tour the lady guide gave a lot of instructions to be followed which was very understandable. The tour consisted of a total of 500 steps. She went way too fast on the tour. There were several people there over the age of 60 who were not in the best of shape. Although she made a point in the beginning that if you think you cannot do it, drop out. I think many thought that it would not be bad if the pace was not too fast and it really should not have been that fast. She did not take into consideration that not everyone makes the trek thru the cave several days a week. On the second stop thru the cave she droned on and on about how someone had touched the walls or ceiling and now the walls and ceiling were ruined forever. If she had not had to make her little power speech, she could have slowed down the pace. There was absolutely no time to take a picture as we were going thru the cave, only at stops so she could talk. But we learned more history and information from the bus driver who took us back to our starting point. He was very nice and liked his job. I realize this is a National Park and the longest known cave in the world. But I have been on a better tour at Ohio Caverns and the cave was more interesting there. I have been to many National Parks, but I would be hesitant to ever take a paid tour thru any park after this experience.","August 2, 2016",Guide was rude,239,"Miamisburg, Ohio",2

Mammoth Cave,"We also visited Indiana Caverns and Squire Boone Caverns in Indiana on our trip. While Mammoth Cave itself is really amazing, it was our least favorite tour for the following reasons: Tour group was large (60-80 people), although knowledgeable our guides were not very personable, bus drivers were not very friendly. We did the Domes and Drips tour. If you are claustrophobic or afraid of heights as I am, getting at the end of the line is quite helpful.","July 31, 2016",Least favorite of 3,3,"Madison, Alabama",3

Mammoth Cave,"Not a beautiful cave, but amazing from the sheer size. We did the historical tour, which was enough for basic cavers, ages 9-75. About 2.5 hours, there were some tight squeezes, and stairs that made it enough of an adventure, without being exhausting. We felt like we got an idea of the cave experience. The ranger station and museum were wonderful, so build time in to explore those. Make reservations online to avoid long lines and full tours. Bring a jacket and walking shoes. Plan on a good half day for sure. ","July 30, 2016",Don't miss this,200,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5
Mammoth Cave,"Well, the name says it all. While we could talk all day about which is our favorite scenic park ABOVE ground, this place is hands down the winner BELOW. A unique oddity in the world and one of those un-numbered wonders, this place is mammoth on any scale. While I had plans to drive through the region over the 4th I was a little slow in booking the tours - dont do that, as the new entrance tour was all we could get into, plus the self guided. I'm glad we did that since the standard large entrance tours are packed with people and start in the self-guided section, I wanted to see the Dripstones and Domes area anyway. It is cool underground but mostly you notice the humidity up top when you exit. Flash prohibitions ruin the ability to capture some of the beauty, so just focus on things while you're there and enjoy the mental memories. The self-guided section has some of the largest opening underground you'll ever see - the size of an aircraft hanger! The visitor center has all you'll need, gift shop, toilets, museum with explanations, and the long lines of people getting their tickets. Lines outside of the pre-tour times are much more manageable. Food options in the restaurants are limited and busy during holidays and we were warned by friends about the quality. The park itself is in a rather remote area and there's not much around for hotels, food is mostly fast chains. We stayed overnight north in Elizabethtown. The onsite accommodations looked fine but check the reviews and prices first. A little over an hour drive from Nashville if you fly in to BNA. You must have this on your list of parks to see if you enjoy any of the National offerings. I suggest off season for a visit. I would return but only while heading to destinations in the region. the KY highways through the area are truly desolate (but there's gas). We didnt have time but be sure to enjoy the above ground features of the park as well, such as sinks and such, and the ferry across the river.","July 29, 2016",what's in a name??,144,"Lima, Pennsylvania",5
Mammoth Cave,"We chose the frozen niagara tour as we have a 2&4year old, and this tour was listed as easy. The tour was sold out, so we were very glad we booked well in advance.We boarded the bus which took us to the entry of the cave, ready for our 1.5hr tour.As we had the ranger speak to us before boarding the bus, and then had the bus trip there, the ranger talking to us again before entering the cave (plus the bus trip back) - we didn't have a full 1.5hours in the cave.We were underwhelmed with the tour, and next time would definitely book a different one.We travelled approx. 0.3mile in the actual cave. Good/covered footwear is recommended - we walked through a few large puddles and some areas were slippery. We wore sneakers/joggers - and were fine in these.Some areas were narrow and low - so keep this is mind if you don't like confined spaces.There was also an optional area where you could walk down 45 steps to view frozen niagara from the bottom. You didn't have to do this though (if steps are an issue for you).Our 4yo handled it with ease (our 2yo slept in the carrier on my chest).Don't get me wrong - it was lovely to see.

They have a ""test hole"" within the first 5 minutes that will help you see if this tour is right for you - there was a lot of bear crawling through areas with very low ceiling. Our guides were very friendly and helpful, and there was a lot of instruction on how to maneuver through the bigger obstacles. ","July 28, 2016",Intro to Caving,7,,4
Mammoth Cave,Booked my tours months in advance. When we arrived at 9:30am was very glad I had booked early as almost everything was sold out. Domes and Dripstones was our first tour. Nice formations but very large group. You start at visitor center and bus to entrance. Group had about 100 people with a ranger at each end. Most of your was telling us importance of staying together. Had lunch at Mammoth Hotel then visited museum exhibit which did a great job of explaining how the caves are being formed. Afternoon went on Violet City tour. Great experience tour. Small 30-40 person group and you do the hike with hand carried kerosene lanterns only! Just like they did 100 years ago. So cool and the history lessons from the Rangers were captivating. Good substitute for the Grand Ave Tour that they were not offering this summer. ,"July 28, 2016","Must see, but do plan ahead",123,"Horsham, Pennsylvania",5
Mammoth Cave,"We drove 7 hours round trip to visit Mammoth Cave National Park, and my family really enjoyed the Domes and Dripstones tour ($15 per person). The tour lasted 2 hours and was a very good option on a rainy day. We visited on a Thursday and had no problems getting tickets. I rate the cave system a 5... it is amazing. I would rate the park staff a 1, and thus my overall rating is a 3. The park staff we encountered (ticket desk, bus drivers, and Ranger J) were not friendly at all. We also were shocked at how rude the ranger was to several of the visitors on the tour. I highly recommend a cave tour anyway. The cave make up for the shortcomings of the park staff we encountered, and hopefully you will have the opportunity to meet staff who actually enjoy their jobs and enjoy working with park visitors.","July 28, 2016","Nice caves, but park staff not so nice.",4,"Hazard, Kentucky",3

Mammoth Cave,"We arrived at Mammoth Cave around 10:30am on a Friday and they were already sold out of their Historic Tours for the day and were sold out of Domes and Dripstones until 2pm. We purchased the Domes and Dripstones tour for 2pm and then also purchased the Self-Guided Tour to give us something to do while we were waiting. To get to the Self-Guided Tour, you walk down a steep hill to the entrance of the cave. There are guides inside the cave which give you a little bit of information, but you essentially walk through and read the signs on your own. It was a short area (about 1/4 mile), but it was interesting to look at. For the inexpensive price, I think it was worth it if you don't want a strenuous tour. The hardest part was walking back up the hall on your way back to the visitor center!After we were done with the Self-Guided Tour, we decided to grab some food. We stopped at a little cafe in the hotel and had some of the worst service of our life. It took over an hour to get our food. At one point we were worried we were going to have to walk out so that we didn't miss our Domes and Dripstones tour.We met up at the shelter for our Domes and Dripstones tour and the guide gave us a little spiel about what we were doing. He mentioned that you needed to be capable of walking down 290 steps. No big deal since we're relatively healthy people. Well, once we got to the cave, we realized that he failed to mention was that these 290 are tiny submarine type steps, and they curve around the cave. At times, there were openings that I could barely squeeze through. It was definitely a tough climb down and took at least half an hour for everyone to get through. As we walked through the cave, there were a few points where we all sat down on benches and the tour guide cave us some information. It took forever to get all 90 people to these benches, which wasted a huge portion of the tour. The walk through the cave was a lot of up and down steps and ramps, so make sure you're ready for this before you go in. The tour was gorgeous and we saw a lot of cool things. I was definitely in pain from working my muscles the next day though.","July 27, 2016","Great Tours, but Plan Ahead Because it Gets Busy!",26,"Tallahassee, Florida",4
Mammoth Cave,"We opted for the history tour and my mother (60+) was quite worried about how strenuous it would be. Before the tour started, the guide told about the risks and they really do sound worse than it is. My mom nor the rest of us had any trouble walking the stairs, kneeling down a bit or squeezing through the narrow parts. It was exciting though! And the stories we heard were really interesting.","July 27, 2016",History tour: don't let them scare you...,44,"Espoo, Finland",5
Mammoth Cave,"Did the Historic Tour at the end of June. It wasn't very enjoyable.There are way too many people in a single tour group. The park ranger put it the best: it's like a giant slinky. Basically, you move mostly single-filedly through the caves. There were about maybe 3-4 points where the group stops to regroup and the ranger talks about the cave. For the most part, you are rushing through the cave.Tip: buy your tickets early. This is probably only important in the summer time. I bought mine the night before for an early morning tour, and there were 6 tickets left after my purchase. The next day, they were all sold out.Personally, I think they can improve this by admitting less people. I also wouldn't mind seeing an adult-only tour, but I know that's probably unreasonable! I also don't want to fault the rangers too much. They're just doing their job and are pretty knowledgeable and funny. I doubt they have much control over the organization of the tours.Though I haven't done them myself, the self-guided tours are probably more worth your time and money. I think you see the first and last parts of the Historic Tour, and the cave formations don't really vary that much from that. The caves themselves have nothing in particular that looks amazing compared to other caves... it's hard to say. I'm starting to believe all caves look alike now.","July 26, 2016",way too crowded,14,"San Diego, California",2
Mammoth Cave,"I was a little reticent about taking this tour, as it was rated as moderate difficulty. The air temperature was very comfortable and since it is a ""dry cave,"" it didn't smell musty. I was concerned about making it through ""Fat Man's Misery"" and ""Tall Man's Misery"" sections, but it wasn't very difficult. The narrow part of ""Fat Man's Misery"" was about 2 feel wide, and not being very skinny, I did not have any difficulty getting through that section. It is narrow from about the waist down and wide open from the waste up. Fortunately, ""Tall Man's Misery"" did not last very long. So while it seemed uncomfortable for some of the taller folks (over 6 feet), I didn't see anyone ""crawling."" The pathway for the first part of the tour was smooth pavers. However, as it progresses, the path is bumpy and you need to watch your step. It was a very enjoyable tour.","July 26, 2016",Great Tour,1,"Saint-Paul, Reunion Island",4

We booked our tours online a few days before and there was only the Domes and Dripstones left and the Historical tour left. We are all very happy with the one we chose. It was two hours long and they took us down to see Frozen Niagra. We actually got to see some cave bugs too. We didn't see any bats though. The tours were amazing and I'll definitely come back to take another one some time. After the tours we had to wipe our feet off on things you walk across so we wouldn't spread white nose syndrome for the bats. People were walking around the walkways for it and not wiping their feet. If you go please make sure you walk across the mats. After that we went hiking and went to the historic entrance. You can go down there and look around but you can't get far. This place was so cool.

Well let me say, I am not in the best shape of my life, but i struggled at the end. Unless you are used to steep climbing and hiking, this tour may be difficult. Everyone in our tour struggled at one point or another besides a couple of teenage boys. The first mile is pretty much paved, and very easy walking, and the second mile starts to get a little more difficult, mostly because it is dirt and uneven but still is relatively simple. There are stops to sit and hear stories after each mile mark too. The last mile is the worse, there are very steep hills and little traction for gripping that you have to climb and descend, and yes there are stairs after that too. The end of the tour has some of the best sights to see, however we felt very rushed through them trying to quickly climb stairs to get out. It is also impossible to take pictures in the cave as you can not use flash and lanterns give off very dim lights. Other than that, I highly recommend you reserve tickets and take advantage of this tour, it was a great experience to not know exactly what lurks beyond the shadows and to get a taste for how the cave was originally discovered.","July 22, 2016",One of a kind experience,0,"Kalamazoo, Michigan",4
Mammoth Cave,We took our kids - ages 8 and 12 on the domes and drip stone tour and really enjoyed it. It's a 3/4 mile hike with lots of steps but very interesting. It was about 100 degrees outside but about 55 degrees in the cave. We took a sling sack with jackets and a bottle of water which worked out great. Make reservations before you plan to go or be prepared to wait for your tour. No flash photography allowed in the cave.,"July 22, 2016",Very enjoyable,3,"Nashport, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,What an incredible experience! We decided to include this stop on our way home from Florida. So happy we made the choice...Mammoth Cave is a true wonder! We took the historic tour and really learned a lot from our guide. We hope to return and experience some of the other tours!,"July 21, 2016",Amazing!!!,2,"Edinboro, Pennsylvania",5
Mammoth Cave,"We did the historic cave tour and the drips and domes. Both were great, but if you can only do one, I recommend drips and domes- more of what you expect to find in a cave. The cave is cool- bring a jacket. And, the spaces are tight- they are not lying! Our group was too big and too loud- hard to hear the tour guide unless you were upfront. We had a 30 minute break between tours and hoped to get icecream- there's no place to do so. The one place that served dippin dots only took cash.","July 21, 2016",So cool!,48,"Atlanta, Georgia",5
Mammoth Cave," We took two tours on two different days. The first was the Historic Tour and the second the Domes and Dripstones tour. Each taking a couple of hours. The Historic Tour had the most mileage of the two with roughly two miles and you get an idea of why this cave is called Mammoth. ""Broadway"", as it is called, is an emmense passageway. You could easily drive large trucks through some of it. This tour takes you to Level 4 which at the point you stop is 310 feet underground. It is very hard to put what is seen and experienced into words. One of those ""you had to be there"" moments.  The Domes and Dripstones tour you experience a living or active cave as NPS likes to put it. This section of the Cave is wet and the formations still growing whereas much of the Cave is dry and no longer changing. Your entrance is the ""new"" entrance from 1922 as opposed to the ""historic"" which is from 1816. We really can't do justice to the tours or the Cave in words. Plan a trip and find out why they call this cave...Mammoth. ","July 21, 2016",We Understand The Name,37,"Huntsville, Alabama",5
Mammoth Cave,"My husband wanted to visit Mammoth Cave National Park to add to our National Park ""bucket list"" and we were both disappointed in the 2 hour cave tour. The best part of this tour was the last 20 minutes (Frozen Niagara), although our tour guide was very knowledgeable and quite entertaining. We didn't have tickets so we got to the park early and although the tours start at about 8:30 a.m., the Visitors Center didn't open until 8 a.m. I would suggest the 20 minute Frozen Niagara tour instead of Domes and Dripstones.","July 21, 2016",2 Hour Tour (Domes and Dripstones) was Disappointing,57,"Lewisburg, Pennsylvania",3
Mammoth Cave,When we first arrived we went to the visitor center and walked through the displays and history of the park. We recommend doing that before you tour as you learn a lot about the history and what you will see in the caves. We were there for a day and a half and plan to go visit again during a cooler time of year to see more of the park. We took the Frozen Niagara tour with our 8 year old son. Others had younger children over 4 years old and they did fine on this tour. We walked down to the entrance of the Heritage Cave on the first day but didn't take the tour. We will add that to our list for when we go back.,"July 21, 2016",Loved the cool air and awesome cave features.,22,"Columbus, Ohio",5

Mammoth Cave,"Way too many people on the tour, over 100. if you weren't right up front you missed a lot. The hike was strenuous and parts of it were more challenging than in the Parks websites description. Parts of the walk were slippery and dark. Make sure you are up for it.

Mammoth Cave,"While visiting a friend in Lexington, Ky he suggested visiting this place. Really I haven't heard much about this place. So we decided to take a drive to see it. It is #2 visited sites next to Niagara Falls. We had to do the easy tour due to mobility issues. They offer several different tours one of which you crawl through parts of the cave. Its is part of over 400 miles of caves. It was nice to see once but we won't travel 3 hours to see it again. It gets very crowded so make your reservations as soon as you can.

Mammoth Cave,"My family and I went to Mammoth Caves and had fun! The Park Guides were very interesting in their presentations and shared a lot of great information about the history of the caves. The weather outside was very warm, but the temps inside the caves were cool and sometimes even chilly! The caves are well-maintained and the tunnels are specifically engineered to have large groups travel single file and not get lost or turned around. They are well-lit and some of the most interesting sections have lights shining on them for photos to be taken since flash photography is not allowed. There are various tours to choose from. Some are long and some are short, but you have to really read the info, look at the maps and choose pricing to maximize your experience. Tip: Go as early as you can, because sometimes the tours sell out during the busy season.","July 20, 2016",Great fun and educational,0,,4
Mammoth Cave,"We visited the area for a long weekend in July 2016. We took the Historic Tour of Mammoth Cave and it was great. The cave is huge and the tour was easy. It took about 2 hours. Wear a jacket because it's a steady 55 degrees in the cave which felt great on a 90 degree day. Shorts and gym shoes were fine. There are a number of steps at the end, but doable. The only complaint is that the tour group was so big, 100+, that we couldn't always hear what the guide was explaining about certain areas. We went at 11:30A on a Saturday so maybe during the week it would be less crowded. That being said, I wouldn't let that stop you from visiting.

Mammoth Cave,Took one of the listed tours - Domes and Dripstones. Was listed as moderate exercise - makes one wonder what kind of physical health the average person is - I found this quite easy. Lots of steps DOWN with a good handrail to hold on to if need be. Only real unfortunate portion of the tour were the children. Lots of acting out and talking making it difficult to hear the presentations. Tour itself was cool - 2 hours from bus pick up to drop off. Walking was at a leisurely pace. This portion of the tour was $15 but you can go into the one entrance of the cave for free though I am doubtful you can get far with that one.,"July 19, 2016",Nice Cave Tour,13,"Baltimore, Ohio",4
Mammoth Cave,I visited Mammoth Cave 40 years ago. Since that time the trails have been greatly improved with pavers and stainless steel handrails. There is so much more cave now. 400 plus miles makes it the largest cave in the world. For guided tours you need to make your reservations in advance on line especially on weekends. Be aware of the fact that the tours may contain as many as 500 stairs. I had a 4 month old new hip and was able to do the tours with the help of a walking stick. Slower people need to tell the ranger so they will be up front. Trails around the park are well marked and lead to beautiful views.,"July 19, 2016",Improved trails,130,"Florence, Kentucky",5

We also went on a short hike. The trails were well marked. We partook in the 'historic cave tour' We booked this tour a week prior to our arrival. I am happy that we did as most morning tours appeared to be sold out. The tour was two hours in length. It was very well done. There were two guides - one leading the group and sharing interesting stories and history with respect to the caves - the second guide followed the group ensuring no one was left behind. The caves are amazing! I was surprised at the number of people in the tour - approximately 80-100 people. At first I was concerned but everyone went at their own pace and the guides were adept at handling this many people.

We went this month and the Historic Tour was sold out so we did the Domes and Dripstones Tour and were bused to another entrance so we could get to a vertical cave and we went 250 feet down. It was really amazing and the formations were awesome. I was glad we ended up on this tour.

Mammoth Cave,My daughter and I planned a day trip while in the area. I was really disappointed in the tour options. I was struggling to pick one and ended up going to a different cave. That being said we did not want to miss Mammoth cave so we did the self guided tour. Coming to the park was neat and we got to take the ferry (which is free) across the river. On arrival we tried to have a picnic but got rained out. That set the pace for the rest of the afternoon. It was raining when we went down to the cave. Coming out it was like a monsoon. The water was running down the hill over the tops of our shoes. We made it to the visitor center just in time for them to declare a weather emergency. We held up in the visitor center along with all the scheduled tours for about 30 min. The cave itself is huge hence the name. It is not that interesting to look at. I would like to go back to explore the park but would not pay to see the cave again. Follow this bit of advice and book tours ahead of time. Every tour was sold out the day we went except for the self guided. From what I heard the next day was sold out as well,"July 18, 2016",Could have been better,117,"New Richmond, Ohio",4

We had a 5 and 8 year old with us and never complained once. I am somewhat claustrophobic but the fat man's misery was no big deal.

We'll visit again, making sure to schedule our tours in advance.While at the park, we biked the Maple Springs and Big Hollow trails. My only complaint is that the Big Hollow trail can get a bit confusing at it crosses itself several times. It would be helpful if the park had signage on the trail showing ""you are here"" in several spots.

Mammoth Cave,"It doesn't have the flair of other caves, but it is Mammoth. We took the ""Historic Tour"" during our visit. Having read reviews and spending time on the park website, we decided to order our tickets in advance. It made it extremely easy for our family, upon arrival, to get our instructions and have plenty of time to view the museum. The tour was not strenuous. However, if you are not accustomed to walking or exerting yourself, it might seem strenuous. Being tall and large boned, I worried about the small places listed on the tour. There was no need to. Unless you are extremely large (my wife would say ""fluffy"") or very tall (6'5""), I wouldn't let the small spaces description deter you from taking the tour. Our park ranger was extremely knowledgeable and had a great sense of humor. Short of the tour and museum, we didn't do anything else in the park.

Mammoth Cave,"We visited Mammoth Cave on July 16th and 17th. In short, the experience was incredible. Not only were the caves a natural wonder, but the rangers went out of their way to be friendly and answer numerous questions from our 9 year old daughter. We arrived on Saturday planning to do the ""Domes and Dripstones"" tour only to find that everything was sold out. We managed to get tickets to the self-guided tour for Saturday and did the ""Domes and Dripstones"" on Sunday. Although we were initially disappointed to only do the self-guided on Saturday, I'm so glad it worked out the way it did. The caves for each tour were different and the self-guided had 3 rangers stationed throughout, all of whom were a wealth of information. The ""Domes and Dripstones"" involves walking down a narrow shaft for about 300 stairs and is not for those who become anxious in small spaces. I was uncomfortable going down.... but I am so glad I did. The cave is incredible and Ranger Elizabeth made the experience very enjoyable and informative.

Mammoth Cave,"Took our 13- and 14-year old girls to Mammoth Caves for a day trip while driving from Nashville to Cincinnati. It is a great stop for a few hours (you could stay and spend more time, though it is fairly remote so understand that accommodations will be just okay and entertainment mainly cheesy). Our GPS was very wonky-just follow highway signs).We ate at Mammoth Cave Hotel restaurant (right by visitor center-no longer the actual hotel). Not fancy, but decent and had some fun Southern lunch classics like a fried bologna sandwich and a BLT with fried green tomatoes.We took the historical cave tour. Very witty and impressively knowledgeable. We had an inquisitive group and she had an answer for everything. Take the health warnings seriously-it's a bit tiring, especially at the end. Then again, I am an out-of-shape, not skinny middle aged woman and I made it, so don't be too afraid to suck it up unless you have heart problems or a new knee or something. The caves themselves are amazing. Something to experience and see.

Mammoth Cave,"Went on 2 tours which I will review independently. First I will comment on the parking lot/visitor center. The parking lot was a bit small but the visitor center was nice and well-organized. Getting tickets for reserved tours was a breeze. There was a nice ""walk through"" display of the history of the cave which we enjoyed. The restrooms were nice and there were designated ""Shelter areas"" where tours met. They announced tours a few minutes ahead of time so you knew where to meet up with your guide. There were probably about 40 people in each tour we attended, of all ages. The facility was clean but I wish there was a display showing a description of each tour and any limitations (which I will speak on more later!). The guides go over these prior to each tour but it's hard to realize until you get down there. They do tell you each time that if you needed rescued it would take several (like 6-7 hours) to get you out of the cave if necessary...but they don't mean to scare anyone. 1) Historic tour: This tour was about 2 hours and entered the cave from the natural entrance with multiple stairs down into the cave. This tour covered the first several miles of the cave system including points of interest such as the salt peter mine, giants coffin, fat mans misery, and the bottomless pit. Now about limitations--- I am 5 foot 4 inches and consider myself a petite lady. This tour would be physically challenging for anyone that considers them self tall or very overweight. I say this because there are points on the tour that the walls come to within less than an arm span and there are several sections where even myself had to duck down to get under the rocks while navigating stairs as well. I get claustrophobic at times but this was okay because with all the tight spaces, they didn't last long and things opened back up again shortly after. There were places where footings were tricky and I can not stress this enough (DO NOT WEAR FLIP FLOPS OR SANDALS), wear walking shoes. I saw so many people with flip flops on and one lady even scratched her foot. Plan to navigate tricky terrain and many stairs. The stairs are overwhelming at times. There is a section that goes essentially from the bottom of the cave to the top in the ""Tower."" There are so many stairs that if I wasn't young and in shape I would have been short of breath. But the guides take it slow and you have handrails and I felt secure the whole time. This tour took us in and out the same way so there was just a few hundred feet of ""repeat"" trail. Most of it is pretty dark, but the trails are lit as you go every few hundred feet or so. Just don't slow down and get in the back of the tour because they turn the lights out as soon as the pack has passed a certain spot. You might get left in the dark. Although they announce that there is no flash photography people still did it. I enjoyed the tour and the history the guide gave us along the way. This tour was very cold, so bring a jacket if you get cold easily. There were mats to wash your shoes off at the end of the tour to help stop the spread of an illness that the bats can get. There is quite an incline back up the hill to the visitor center so be prepared to take your time, however there are benches along the way. 2) Domes and Dripstones tour:This was my favorite tour! We rode a bus to the entrance for this tour. This tour entered from a ""New"" Entrance that looked like a metal door in the side of the hill (which was kinda cool). This tour covered a shorter area than the Historic tour but there were a lot more stairs. We were further down (about 300 feet below ground) on this tour. The first part of the tour was tight (about 1-2 people wide across) and we went down a lot of stairs. These tighter walkways made me a bit anxious but that was mostly because we saw a few cave crickets running past along the wall. My 6 year old daughter freaked out but the further down into the cave we got, there were no more visible. The tour also went through part of the Frozen Niagra tour and ended up in the Drapery Room, where all the formations were. This was the coolest thing I saw at Mammoth Cave. This was one of the only parts of the cave where formations were visible. It was beautiful and looked like water dripping off the rocks. We got some pretty good pictures here (even without flash because they have lights pointed at a lot of the formations). About limitations I will say that all the stairs you go down at the beginning of the tour are a warm up for the steep inclines/stairs you have to navigate at the end of the tour. The inclines are slippery and there aren't always handrails. The stairs on this tour were much shallower and harder to navigate. I definitely had to watch my steps. The tour ended at an exit (which was a revolving door) near the entrance to Mammoth Cave Hotel. We again had to wash our shoes and were funneled into the Hotel. There were several gift shops here and the hotel hallway led you over a stone footbridge to the back of the Visitor center so it was a nice loop (without the incline of the natural entrance). Overall, both tours were physically challenging but anyone in good health could do it. We saw older folks on the tour just taking more time and moving slower, but they got through it. I would not recommend either tour for anyone who is deathly claustrophobic or unable to navigate many, MANY flights of stairs. Overall, it was an amazing experience and although I was anxious going into the tours, the sights were well worth it. Our guides were great and the park has a fantastic operation with its tours. The price was low for such a great piece of national history. There are so many places in the US that people need to visit. Please visit your national and state parks- they hold many wonderful treasures for people of all walks of life.","July 15, 2016",I was nervous but it was an awesome experience!,13,"Columbus, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,We recently visited with my extended family and had a great day. We did not stay long- an hour in the visitors center and then the two-hour Historic Tour. If you're so inclined you could spend much longer there taking more than one tour and hiking some trails. On a previous trip (about 12 years ago probably) my friends and I did the Wild Cave Tour. It is a memory I'll never forget and it was worth every penny of the cost. On this trip we had kids aged 4 months - 13 years. Honestly it would have been nice to have been able to leave the 4 mo old and 2 year old behind but none of the adults volunteered to stay behind. :) The older kids really enjoyed themselves.

Mammoth Cave,"Made this trip as a child and wanted to take my children to this landmark. Did some hiking and took the historic tour. Ranger was extremely knowledgeable and worked great with the crowd. You will not see a lot of formations on this tour; however, the history and grandeur of the cave is fabulous. Lodging and tours book in advance, so give yourself some time to plan. We missed out on the Woodland Cottages, where I really wanted to stay, but waited too close to time to book. Same with cave tours. We lucked up on a cancellation. So even if the board shows your desired tour as ""booked"", go to the ticket desk just to be sure. You might get lucky and be able to squeeze in. Gave up on taking pics in the cave. My camera system wasn't robust enough with a low enough f-stop to get pics without a flash.

Mammoth Cave,"I remember visiting Mammoth Cave as child. The wonder of them turning out the lights and seeing it pitch black was always an awesome memory. Recently, I took my little girl there with my family, and we got to re-experience that, and it was just as awesome as I had remembered.We did the historic tour. Our tour guide was TREMENDOUS! We wound through cavernous spaces, to the Fat Man's Misery, and Tall Man's Misery, to the Giant's Coffin - and then up about 900 steps. That space where you climb the steps is amazing, but what made our trip even more awesome was the fact that it had been raining hard that day, and there were natural water falls pouring through. Our guide said that in 17 years, this was only the second time he had seen that much water pouring through. It was amazing.Definitely an awesome place to go - I highly recommend this for all ages. There's a tour that everyone can do.","July 13, 2016",A wonderful example of Great Beauty,43,"Tampa, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"We did the Historical Tour (2 hours/2 miles) with three kids (3, 7, 8 yo) and the difficulty level of the walk was perfect for them. The guide kept a nice pace; the tour started and ended on time. One of our guides, Linda, was amazing at talking our anxious son through the tour. We wouldn't have made it through without her assuaging his fears about being underground. We walked some of the trails after the cave tour- all were well maintained and well marked. The ""fast food"" restaurant by the hotel was easy for a quick bite before our tour began. Food was nothing special (hotdogs and fries), but got the job done.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave National Park is very interesting since the major attraction is available only with tours. The two tours we took (Historical and Dome&Dripstones) were both excellent. The rangers were knowledgeable and funny. If you first go through the exhibit in the visitor's center before the tours, it makes the tour so much more interesting.This is a BIG cave! It's mostly dry and it's actually very pleasant to walk since the temperature is always 54 degrees. Since it's a cave, there will be slopes and stairs, and there will be some tight spaces but overall, it's well maintained and interesting.The outdoor trails around the visitor center is ""normal"", meaning it's pleasant but nothing spectacular. You get a good view of the Green River, which is really brown after the rain :-). The Green River is not very big so not much to look at.We spent two days here but if you only do the cave, you can do it in one day with a tour in the morning and another one in the afternoon. Historical Tour is a good overall tour if you can do the roughly 2 miles of walking and about 310 feet of change in elevation.Be sure to book the tours before you get there. Many of the tours, especially the morning ones are sold out.There is no entrance fee for the park, but the tours do cost money.","July 13, 2016",Pleasent and interesting,158,"Cary, NC",4
Mammoth Cave,"The cave was just an amazing experience. I took the Violet City tour, which is a 3 mile lantern light tour. If you have mobility issues don't take this tour - I am in good shape and my calves were burning by the end from all the climbing. But it was incredible to be underground for such a long time in such a huge cave with only lantern light to guide us. Stayed at the Mammoth Cave campground which was great. All around amazing experience. And I will be back. ","July 13, 2016",Unbelievable!,24,"Burtonsville, Maryland",5

Mammoth Cave,"We had a blast at Mammoth Cave National Park. My wife, 3 year old son and I had originally planned to go to Lost River Cave in Bowling Green, KY but came to find out their cave was flooded! (There had been lots of heavy rains in the last few days there) So make sure to call ahead to Lost River Cave Tours. So we made the short and scenic drive up to Mammoth Cave which is largely unaffected by weather. When we got there around 2pm the visitor’s center was BUSY! We spoke to the ranger at the information desk about the different tours available, as there are many to choose from of varying distances and time. Come to find out that, all of the tours except the Self-Guided Discovery Tour. If there is a specific tour you want to go on I highly suggest going online and buying your tickets ahead of time! The self-guided tour was perfect for us with a young child, as it was a relatively short walk and it could take as long or as short as we wanted it to. The short walk from the visitors center to the cave entrance is paved and at a mild grade. As a bonus, we saw a deer grazing on our walk. A ranger met us at the top of the stairs and took our tickets and gave us a little background about the tour before we went down (and back up at then end) the 70 stairs to the cave entrance past a nice photo-op waterfall. Tip: It is 54 degrees (F) all the time so it would not hurt to bring a jacket if you plan to tour a while.The cave portion for the self-guided discovery tour does not have any cave formations, but is still nice to walk through and was fairly level and adequately lit for the most part. Our son had brought his explorer vest and flashlight so he had a great time “exploring the cave”. My wife and I enjoyed the educational displays and stops along that told about the exploration of the cave, various uses through time and the formation of the cave. (We saw no bats or other animals during our time in the cave.) We spent about 45 minutes in the cave before returning to the surface. We returned to the visitor’s center and made our way through the extremely nice museum. The museum detailed the history of the formation of the cave, the early explorers, the surrounding countryside (and sinkholes) , the settlers, then the development of the cave into a national park. There are audio recordings at each station and a very well done movie as well. At the end of the museum there is an informative section about the importance of environmental conservancy and its impact on the cave and local wildlife as well. The center also has two gift shops. The larger one is the actual National Park Gift Shop, and has lots of great informative books and toys, shirts, postcards, magnets, patches, etc. The second smaller gift shop in the open foyer area looked like it was run by the management company that runs the hotel. It had a small but different selection of shirts, patches, pencils, and jewelry available. We ended up getting several items from both. Make sure to make a donation to the park on your way out to help support the great ongoing work of this and other national parks. We all thoroughly enjoyed our visit at Mammoth Cave National Park. We just wish we had more time to enjoy some of the many attractions that they have to offer. With numerous types of cave tours, junior ranger programs, an onsite hotel, miles of hiking/biking/horse trails, canoeing/kayaking, RV and tent camping and plenty of site seeing there is something for everyone to enjoy the entire year round.","July 13, 2016",Great time at Mammoth Cave National Park Visitor’s Center and on Self-Guided Discovery Cave Tour,12,,5

It was a very reasonable cost compared to other activities we looked at, $64.00 for 7 people.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave National Park above ground is a forested area much like other National Parks, with camp grounds, picnic areas and well informed rangers. Below ground is another world indeed. Mammoth Cave is part of an extensive and largely connected cave system that the untrained eye would normally miss. Part of an immense karst topography that lends itself to cave formation through the action of mildly acidic rainwater acting on limestone over millions of years, it was discovered less than a hundred years ago and is now protected by the National Park Service for future generations to enjoy. We took the Domes and Dripstones tour that lasted about two hours, part of which was a bus ride from the Visitor's Center to the cave entrance. The cave itself has an isolation system that keeps the entrance of outside air to a minimum while still allowing tourists to enter with the guide. This tour is not an easy one as it involves well over 250 steps to floor of the cave, narrow places and up and down ramps. Certainly not handicap accessible, although I understand there are other cave tours that may be accessible. Our guides, Joel and Bobby, were very knowledgeable and provided an excellent introduction to cave formation and environmental factors. Although we went with a family group of 18 people that had little previous cave experience, my wife and I have visited other caves in the past and were able to compare Mammoth Cave to others. On that scale, we rated Mammoth as fairly good, but certainly not the best we have experienced. However, for those new to a cave experience, I'd recommend it, particularly in light of its easy drive from large population areas. Online reservations are suggested as it may be crowded and some tours fill up quickly. Tours are held throughout the day, but if you have a schedule to keep or want one of the specialized small group tours, make your reservations ahead of time online.","July 11, 2016",The Name of the Park Says it All,139,"Beechgrove, Tennessee",4

Mammoth Cave,"We went on four tours at Mammoth Cave The park itself is very beautiful and very large thousands of acres.The whole experience was very different and unusual we enjoyed it and learned a lot about Mammoth Cave.There are a few things people should deffinetly be aware of first I wouldn't recommend anybody to bring any children under five years old or anyone with serious health conditions that might not be able to make it through these cave tours there are many many steps up and down rough terrain,many very wet areas wear good hiking boots,There are very tight and low hanging places in the cave.If You are scared of tight dark places don't go there areas that are very large but you sometimes have to go through tight crooked areas to get to them.If You have any breathing issues bring Your inhaler or maybe don't go.Its very cool in the caves 54 degrees which felt good to me but may be cool to You.Bring or wear a jacket the cave is very interesting when You leave the cave You will experience a temperature change and get hot very quickly stay hydrated drink lots of water.also everyone go to the restroom first these tours are kind of long most two hours.Make sure its the kind of tour You want they vary.Also no cell signal in the park and most of the whole area they need more cell towers in the area.Your GPS may not work right ours didn't get a physical map.You will be driving for long periods the rivers in the area are flooded right now when we were there it rained five inches in one night.We missed our last tour and had to cancel theres a three dollar charge for this on each ticket.Have Your vehicle checked out before this trip if You break down then no phone signal is available.The visitors center has wifi but its sketchy and weak.If You are fully prepared then and know what Your getting into then You will enjoy the cave.Pictures are allowed but no flash photography.I would also suggest bringing a cooler for water,drinks snacks,sandwiches etc.they have a water refill area at the visitors center.Remember too there are deer and wild turkey in the area so careful driving and if You go enjoy Your trip we did except for getting misplaced the last day due to faulty GPS get a map.Thank You I hope I could be of some help.I will add photos later.Small children and babies it scared while we were there due to the darkness plus in my opinion it coyuld be dangerous for them and they probably wouldn't remember it anyway so its up to You most will probably cry the ones in our groups did and I felt bad for them because they were scared its dark in caves especially the night tours.The whole area is very pretty though.","July 11, 2016",Unusual Experience Huge Cave,9,"Coldwater, Mississippi",4

Mammoth Cave,"We took ""Domes and Dripstones"" and the ""Historic"" Tours. Both were excellent and quite different. Domes and Dripstones was more about the aspects of the cave and at the end you got to see the formations that people know most about caves. But the entire tour was very interesting. A windbreaker with a hood would be helpful since you will get dripped on!The Historic Tour was just that. It gave you a lot of history about the cave and the people who used it. It also had some very fascinating formations, Fat Man's Misery was such fun. Sneakers or hiking shoes are recommended for both tours.Our guides were very informative and able to answer questions.

Mammoth Cave,"This is definitely an impressive cave system. My biggest complaint is the lack of tours available. Now, I booked kinda last minute, but there literally were 2 tours available. The Historic Tour and the Domes and Dripstones tour. The tours that interested us the most were offered once a day or not at all the day we would be there. Why would you do these cool tours only once?? I mean if a tour is 6 hours long, i get it. But they weren't all that way. And our historic tour had so many people in it that we got pushed to the back and missed stuff that was being said. We never had a chance to ask questions and I honestly learned more walking through the museum exhibit than the tour, which seems odd to me. Both tour guides were great, but just didn't get a ton of information on the first tour. We enjoyed the Domes and Dripstones more. We learned more, but we also learned our lesson and stuck to the front of the tour group. Not sure if we will have a chance to go back, so we made the most of the day, but we were bummed we couldn't do the other tours, especially since both tour guides repeatedly said that we should check them out! More than one person near me said maybe if they weren't sold out for weeks... I saw a lot of disappointed people leaving the park when they realized everything was sold out. I also didn't love how the park doesn't have a self-guided tour of any of the caves (I heard there was a discovery tour but it was a tiny portion). Most other caves I have visited you can buy a ticket and see a significant section of the caves and then specialized tours allow you to see more. This cave doesn't have that. Just something people should really know before you go there because I have never seen a cave do that before. All in all, very impressive but they should advertise more that you really need to book ahead.","July 10, 2016",Great Caves but Plan Ahead!,13,"Baltimore, MD",4

Had problems at the visitor center - when I asked for a park map, I was given the ""Oh, Ranger"" booklet and told there was a map in the middle of the booklet.Historic tour - They book too many people (over 100) on the tour and only stop 4 times. This was okay if you have never been in a cave but very boring and can't stop really unless it is at one of the stops that they schedule.They didn't enforce the no sandals rule on either tour and I was afraid a couple of times that someone would trip on the steps because of them being so slippery and them not wearing good footwear and fall on me or my family.Also there seemed to be an inconsistency on walking sticks.

Mammoth Cave,"Counter clerks were rude and argumentative. The first clerk turned around and walked off in the face of the people in front of us without bothering to tell anyone why. When we got to the counter and asked the clerk there a question about one of the tours she proceeded to tell us things that were in direct contradiction with the information provided in the park booklet and online. When we questioned her about this she became very argumentative. Rangers later confirmed for us that information in the booklet/online was correct and the clerk was incorrect. However, because of the conflicting information we were very confused about the tour options.Interaction with the counter clerk aside, this was the most disappointing visit to a national and/or state park that we have ever had. We love to explore and make a point to visit as many state and national parks as possible. We were very much looking forward to Mammoth Cave but we left feeling as if we had wasted our time and money. The walking tour we were on could easily have been condensed to take up only half as much time, but it was drawn out which made it incredibly boring. If you like exploring and you have ever toured other caves or learned anything at all about the Civilian Conservation Corps then I recommend taking one of the more interactive tours (i.e. one that allows you to climb, crawl, etc) rather than a walking tour where you're herded in and out, with long stops in between to listen to the same talks you hear in other places. I suppose Mammoth Cave is great if you don't have much opportunity to explore or if you've never visited other caves. For us it ended up being one of those places we'll simply mark off our bucket list and not return. ","July 10, 2016",Very disappointed,5,,2

As has been noted by others, it's not a colorful cave, but it's fascinating. The history was great to learn about. The historical tour was moderately strenuous, lots of steps (especially the end) and some uneven footing. The best part for me was Tall Man's terror and Fat Man's misery.

I can not recommend spending money to walk into the entrance area (self guided tour).","July 6, 2016",Way too over commercialized,23,"Owensboro, Kentucky",2
Mammoth Cave,This was a beautiful national park and was put together rather well. They have trails and hikes for all ages as well as a variety of cave tours. The only issue with the park is some of the strange regulations that seem more local than it being a parks issue. Couldn't get more shower tokens for paying customers; this seemed idiotic. We had a great time otherwise and enjoyed the clean bathrooms and peaceful campground. Lovely place. ,"July 6, 2016",Mammoth indeed,10,"Chicago, Illinois",4
Mammoth Cave,"We took our 4yo daughter on the Frozen Niagara tour. We spent as much time on the bus (30 min) as we did in the cave (30 min), and our guide - a 17 year veteran ranger - provided little more than the knowledge I gained about caves in third grade. He responded (nicely) with ""I'm not a geologist"" at least twice. By comparison, guides at Ruby Falls in Chattanooga (where we visited last year) provided amazing detail about all aspects of that cave/the falls, so I was expecting the same caliber tour.Ticket counter clerks were rude but efficient.It may be that other tours/guides provide a gar superior Mammoth Cave experience, but ours experience was disappointing.Note:* You can bring regular backpacks and bottled water. * no flash photography allowed* babywearing?

The rest of the park is alright, nothing national park status worthy.","July 5, 2016",Not that impressive ,0,,2

It was way too crowded, the park ranger kept referring to notes as if she didn't know what to say next , and it felt very rushed for a two-hour tour.

Mammoth Cave,"I booked well in advance for a tour as we went on the July 4th weekend which is notoriously a busy time to visit the cave. When we got there getting our tickets from our online reservation was quick and easy. All tours were booked on the day we went so I was happy I did the online reservations which was easy. Our family chose the Historical tour which was good, but with 120 folks in each group you will encounter those that talk way too much, those that should not go on the 2- mile tour as they are a health risk and can't walk any faster than molasses in winter. Additionally, whatever the guide said we did not hear as we got stuck behind a group of obnoxious folks that talked incessantly about nothing related to the cave or area. It was very annoying. With the negative out of the way, the cave is Mammoth as the name implies and is so worth going on one of the many tours. We plan to go back at some point to do some of the additional tours but not during peak tourist times. Wear closed toed shoes and comfy ones as you will walk up and down and in tight spots. Our tour guide was incredibly knowledgeable of not only the cave history but geology as well. I wish we could have heard more of her talk but with a noisy group that was impossible no matter where we tried to place ourselves amongst 120 others on our tour.","July 5, 2016",Amazing Piece of America,22,"Huntsville, Alabama",5

The tour for those with mobility issues sells out fast. They really need to schedule more of those. We heard a number of people asking about that. If the caves aren't your thing, they have plenty of hiking trails...some with a lot of climbing involved and others for those with mobility issues.

Mammoth Cave,"We took the 6/12/16 12:15pm Domes and Dripstones Tour. We did not make reservation online like a lot of the other reviews suggested but only had to wait a hour for the next tour. We decided on the Domes and Dripstones Tour based on the description. After a 10 minutes safety talk before boarding the bus to take us to the entrance and then another safety talk. 30 minutes had passed on this 2 hour tour and we haven't even entered the Cave yet. Part of the safety talk goes into not taking this tour if you are claustrophobic. Our tour group was a ridiculous 117 people - which proves they are more interested in the money then your experience. There were 2 tour guides and we entered in groups of about 20 in an air control entrance. We were half way in the group which meant again wait another 10 minutes to enter the cave. The entrance goes down narrow stairs and passages. Only to find one young girl freaked out and was trying to get back up the step with her mother on steps that are only design for 1 person. The ranger in the back started laughing and told the lady that the taking the tour with the rangers and who was carrying a clipboard, ""I had 6 one time on a tour find out they were claustrophobic!"" Not very compassionate for this young girl. We took flashlights (some tours do not allow them so check 1st) I'm glad we did since the beginning of this tour is not very interesting. We could not hear the rangers talking as we were in the middle of the crowd. When we got to the benches several people raised their hands to ask questions, only to be told that the ranger was going to wait until everyone got in the room to answer any questions. After he did his little speech and turn the lights off. He said ok lets get going and not to go so slow that you would be stuck in the back with the lights off. He ignore the people that had there hands raised to ask a questions. The only interesting part of the tour was the Frozen Niagara part at the end. I can't recommend any of the other tours since that was the only tour we took.","July 4, 2016",Too large of group in tour,280,IL,2

Mammoth Cave,"We stopped here since it was on our way home and we had some time to kill. Having been in caves before, both commercial and wild, we knew about what to expect. The visitor center is where to purchase tickets, use restroom, visit gift shop and has a hotel in the same complex. There are several different tours with varying lengths of time and difficulty levels (stairs, narrow passage ways, etc.). The information desk is manned with personnel to help decide which tour is right for you. We took the Domes and Dripstone Trail. Our tour met under a pavilion where two rangers gave a short instruction talk about use restrooms now, only allowed to have water in the cave, it's 54 degrees in the cave, if you have a medical issue this is not the tour for you. He seemed almost grouchy, but after taking the tour with the group, I understand why. We loaded onto three buses to take us to the cave entrance. We assembled, got another instruction talk and headed down the stairs in the cave. We didn't cover a lot of ground in the cave even though it took a little over two hours. Most of that time was waiting on the slow pokes in the back of the group to catch up, listen to some history about the discovery of the cave and early explorers, then move on again. One ranger led the group and the other ranger was behind the group. The cave itself was nice. Our tour had a capacity of 120 people. Not sure how many were in our group, but we were getting close to that number. I would recommend taking a different tour, maybe a longer one, and doing it in the off season if crowds are not your thing. The groups are just too big to really enjoy the cave. I plan to go back but won't be doing this tour again.","July 4, 2016",Nice visit on a hot day,60,"Jefferson City, Missouri",4

It was well worth the 450 mile trip from Columbia, Missouri.Our Park Ranger was Tammy and she performed magnificently. Of special interest, turning the lights out in the cave. Gives dark a whole other meaning.My knees can no longer handle 400 steps up and down stairs or I would have undertaken the Historic Tour which is my favorite. We took the Frozen Niagara Tour instead which is a great way to introduce newbies to the thrill of cave exploring. My 13 year old grandson and 15 year old granddaughter had the time of their lives and both were clamoring to come back and take more tours.Tours are VERY popular and to get the best choice of tour and time, book reservations and purchase tickets at least two months in advance.The Mammoth Cave Hotel is available but must be booked well in advance.

Kept us laughing & showed us lots of ""extras"". I usually get bored with too much detail, but the cave was interesting, and the wit of the rangers kept us laughing. It was the only cave we had time to visit while in the area, and we were glad we chose it. It may not be ""colorful"" but its massiveness demands respect! I consider it a must-see.

Mammoth Cave," Worth a visit at least once in your lifetime! Arrive early and be sure to book your tour early, the park fills up fast and tours sell quickly. When I visited the park if I remember right there were four tours available. The first tour I took was the Domes and Dripstones. It was ok, a bit boring. Just big open rooms and a lot of talking from tour guides. It took about 2 hrs. There are a lot of steps and stairs for this tour. Not being impressed I decided to take the Historic tour and although not 100% percent I have to say it was better. The Historic tour has a more up to date walkway and i think it is more spaced out so your not right on top of the person walking in front of you. This tour also took 2 hrs with steps and walking. There is a temperature difference in the cave. However it is not to bad, in the summer it's nice. Just a light jacket if you get cold easily. There are plenty of gift shops and places to eat all centered around the Visitor's Center which is also where you buy tour tickets. Not my favorite cave system but worth checking out at least once in your lifetime. ","July 4, 2016",Visit at least once! ,58,"Eaton, Ohio",3
Mammoth Cave,"We took two tours, historic and domes and dripstones. While historic takes you through mostly wide spaces in the cave and gives a good amount of information on history of caves, domes and dripstones is more of adventure. It takes you down about 250ft down through a narrow passage way though stairs. At places it can be very closed spaces that you are walking through, but the stairs are built safe with railings on both sides to hold on to. You will need to watch your steps and also head as there could be rocks lying very low. The park rangers/tour guides are great and makes sure everyone in the group gets back safely! Definitely recommend doing domes and dripstones.","July 4, 2016",Excellent caves!,5,"Champaign, Illinois",5

They do a good job of shepherding all those people through the cave, but it is rather slow moving. The Gothic tour was only 40. It was good. We also took the Focus on Frozen Niagara tour which is a photography tour. We found that fun because you get to linger around Frozen Niagara and take your time getting your photos. Tripods are allowed on this one. You need to book ahead for the photo tour.We had a good time. None of the tours are really that strenuous. Yeah some stairs, but there is no rush to get to the top.

After lunch in the cafe, we were ready for the Historic Tour (another below-ground tour). Our two grandsons (ages 11 and 15) enjoyed it as much as the rest of us.

Mammoth Cave,"This natural wonder exceeded my expectations. There are lots of tours to chose from. I would suggest the Historical tour as the first choice for its variety--- open, majestic spaces to enclosed spaces where if you are 5'2"" or taller you need to crouch. Second choice is Domes and Dripstones. Or you can go on both.To ensure you get on the tour you want, it's a good idea to purchase your tickets in advance at recreation.gov. Park rangers were informative and enthusiastic. My only complaint is though I know safety is important, the safety talk was consistently a bit too detailed and lengthy.

The caves could be better lighted so you could see more of the fossils and formations. I would recommend just one tour unless you are in good physical shape.

Mammoth Cave,The caves are pretty spectacular. The first one we did was the grand entrance or something like that. I have never seen a cave so huge! However the tour only went in so far and was over before we knew it. There were tons of steps to get there and a long hilly walk. There were no formations in this cave. The other tour we did was the frozen niagra. This had stalactites and stalagmites. It was a great formation. My biggest disappointment would be there were so many kids on each tour that you couldn't hear anything the tour guide was saying. I definitely think they should have adult only tours and then have some geared more toward children. We did one private cave tour at Kentucky Down Under.

As my Mom put it nothing but a big hole in the ground. Well last week my husband and I decided to go to Mammoth Cave It was on our bucket list. Before going I had not told my husband of my family visit or the opinions about the cave as to not jade his opinion. I thought we would just do some hiking. When we got there we decided to do a cave tour since that was what Mammoth Cave is known for. We decided on the Historical Tour which is two hours long. We were hoping to get some historical information about the cave and see some interesting things in the cave. Well my Mom's opinion still stands and my Husband voiced the same opinion. An hour into our two hour tour my Husband started saying it was nothing more than a big hole in the ground. It could have been a self guided tour. In the two hour tour we stopped maybe four times to have the tour guide tell us something about the cave. With over a hundred people on the tour it was hard to hear. There were no cave formations to see. Again it was just a walk through a big hole. The only good thing was it was cool in the cave and extremely hot outside.

When we did the tour before, we were in a group of about 30 people or so, and the tour was very interesting and informative. This time... over 120 people in one group, with 2 guides. We were herded like cattle through the cave. Since it was impossible for the guide to talk to everyone while moving, we stopped 3 or 4 times so the group could all gather around and hear what the guide had to say. Of course, you still couldn't hear because of the noise.What noise?, you say? Children... lots and lots of little children. At least 6 or 7 who were too young to walk. And infants... seriously... 3 or 4 infants.Imagine trying to experience a cave tour with a continuous chorus of screaming infants. Through. The. Entire. Cave.Please, parents... infants and caves don't mix. You are not providing any positive experience for your infant, and you are RUINING the experience for everyone else.And shame on the Park for allowing infants on these tours. There should be a written warning for this tour, telling everyone that they will have to endure 2 hours of screaming infants echoing in the cave.I had a great time on this tour 25 years ago.

Then we hiked again, and after thinking we were on the wrong trail back we could feel the cold air and knew we were heading in the right direction!

We arrived around 11am and most were sold out already. My friend and I did the 'Domes and Dripstones' tour, which was fun. We also did the self guided tour, which was okay. The self guided tour costs $5 and allows you to wander a very short distance into the main entrance. Guided tours can have well over 100 people, so we did a lot of waiting around. This wasn't too bad because we were in a really cool cave, with lots of areas to look at. 'Domes and Dripstones' had a ton of stairs that lead you down into the cave, but nothing too challenging. I do not recommend wearing flip-flops. Parts of the cave floor were slippery and my sandals didn't have the traction I needed. Also, as you leave the tour you are required to walk over soapy mats. My sandals and feet were gross and sticky afterwards.","June 26, 2016",Lots to do. Don't wear flip-flops.,50,"Mesa, Arizona",4

Mammoth Cave,"There is no park entrance fee, but there are fees for all the cave tours. Suggest buying tour tickets online as they fill up. We took the Domes & Dripstones tour. It was 2 hours long and involved a lot of walking, with lots of stairs, but most of the stairs are enclosed. We were tired afterward; we are in our mid-60's. You take a bus from the Visitor Center & drive about 15 minutes to cave entrance. Our main Ranger was very knowledgeable. Overall, this cave is not as beautiful as say Carlsbad Caverns. Only near the end of the tour was there a wet, living cave. Don't recommend for children under 10 due to length of tour & because younger children on our tour seemed bored & were complaining. We did not have time to visit any other parts of the park.","June 24, 2016",Not as great as expected,41,"Pampa, Texas",4
Mammoth Cave,"The park is beautiful and the inside of the cave is impressive. In an effort to avoid a standard walking tour, we opted for the Introduction to Caving Tour. It was a blast! I do feel that the strenuous rating was misleading, as it did not match up to other strenuous hikes/activities in national parks. I felt it was easier, but I am sure others in the group may have disagreed. It really is dependent on your fitness and comfort level. All in all, it left me wanting to go back for the Wild Cave Tour!

You'll learn useful information for the rest of the tours. We did Domes and Dripstones and Gothic Avenue in one day. I highly recommend all three. If you only have time for 1 tour take the Historical Tour. Great Rangers who are entertaining and knowledgeable. Check it out!!!

We arrived and it was busy. I got in line to purchase tickets. When it was my turn, I wasn't sure which tour to do. The cashier rudely told me to get out of line and wait to talk with one of the Rangers. No one was behind me but there were 5 people waiting to talk with the 2 Rangers in the info booth. I felt she could have taken 30 seconds to tell me the differences. So feeling anxious, I purchased the next tour. I after reading the differences I had buyer remorse. The Dripstone tour was amazing but I wish I had done the history tour. The walk down was challenging but worth it. With the exception of the rude cashier, good experience","June 22, 2016",One minor issue but overall good experience ,12,,4
Mammoth Cave,"I took a tour that was just about 2 hours. Lots of stairs, but as most people are not in the greatest shape, everyone did pretty well. Wear a long sleeve shirt, or carry a light jacket. Also, comfortable shows with good traction. Great for kids to grandma's, as long as walking long distances and lots of steps are not a problem. The cave is enormous, hence the name. Well worth a see. They also have caving for the enthusiast, from short trips to half day trips. Food available up top on site, lots of parking and gift shop. Cameras are not recommended, as the flash can hurt others eyes, or something like that. If you can take pics in the dark without a flash, then your ok. No food allowed in the cave unless for medical reasons. You can carry water.","June 22, 2016",Very nice for the family,21,"Alexandria, Kentucky",4
Mammoth Cave,"We had a limited amount of time, so we decided on a two hour tour (Historic) that was starting in 20 minutes. Our tour guide was informative, friendly and answered questions patiently. Be prepared for cooler temps when you enter the cave. We went from 90 degree temps at ground level to around 55 degrees in the cave. Wear shoes that have good traction, you will be walking on uneven terrain and there are many stairs to climb at the end. We are in our sixties with no physical limitations and had no problem.

He was a wealth of knowledge giving history lessons and pointing out wildlife along the way. The natural formations were beautifully lit and plentiful. The tour we went on was 1.5 hours of hiking on mostly smooth area. Many steps up and down so eat your Wheaties! This tour was a little physically demanding, but not bad.

Mammoth Cave,"I am a ROCK HOUND. Souveniers I collect are Rocks, shells/ocean glass, and food. So I was in heaven. My Beau and I made a day of one of the longest tours at Mammoth Caves - the Historic tour. We made our reservation online and discoverd upon picking up our tickets. That was a good move. 90 tickets were sold out quickly as it was Father's Day. I read from other viewers on this site that it is a good idea to go early to enjoy the visitor center. Which we did. It gives you a basic history of the caves archaeological development and human history. Our head tour guide Ranger Susan and assistant Allison were delightful. Susan was great in her thorough and clear explanation of what to expect and experience in the cave prior to walking down. She also made it fun to see, and her explanation of what would we would be facing as far as the difficulties of the tour walk. Lots of stairs, some moisture, skinny and tight areas to navigate. If her monologue was a script, it did not show in her Delight in touring us. Allison was great heading up the rear and answering my questions along the way. My favorite part was definitely the lights being turned out. Everyone else along for the tour made this even more special by really being quiet and having the lights of their cell phones turned off. My initial concern was how comfortable would I be breathing in the caves? Don't let that bother you! The wind coming through and out of the caves is wonderful. It is cool and refreshing. I would love to go back some other time for more cave exploration. And I behaved and did not take one rock.","June 22, 2016",Rock Hound Heaven,26,"Jacksonville, Florida",5

Mammoth Cave,"The tour guide(park ranger) was excellent (Kevin). He was quite humorous and gave excellent information about knowing what to expect. The longest cave tour is over 300 steps (mostly down, a few up here and there), with some very narrow passages. I would say you need to be in at least 'good' to 'fair' health condition to be able to manage ok. I am not, so towards the end of the tour my thighs were shaking from the exertion that I was afraid I might lose my balance, but I made it. I would NOT recommend taking any child 4 or younger. There were a couple of little ones with other people in our group of 100, and I can't imagine carrying a small child (which you would HAVE to do) the entire time. Even a 5 - 8 year old would need to be of the adventurous persuasion to make it that far without wearing out and getting tired of it perhaps. This tour takes 2 hours. The best part is that the bus picks you up at the bottom so you do NOT have to climb back up all those stairs!! It's beautiful and quite interesting. And there are MANY other tour options which do not require physical agility.","June 21, 2016",Fascinating tour,15,"Columbiana, Ohio",5

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave is the longest cave system in the world. There are several tours to suit your preferences and needs. We took the historic tour, which, in our opinion, gave us the most bang for our buck. It is a two mile tour over the course of two hours and covers portions of other tours. While not necessarily grueling, you do have to be able to negotiate various terrain (steep stairs, low ceilings, ""fat man's misery"") as well as 440 stairs. The historic tour allows you to see several notable landmarks within the cave (the giant's coffin, Mammoth Dome), and our tour guide was very informative and provided a lot of additional information that was quit interesting.

Mammoth Cave,"Named Mammoth Cave because it is so big....huge rooms, more miles of passages than any other cave.We took the ""Explorer's Tour"" because is was the longest and deepest of the normal tours...figured it would be the best......2 miles, and about 550 stairs...The tour had 125 people on it....far to many in my opinion.....and our guide was a girl with a squeeky, scratchy voice.....had a hard time being heard during the tour.The cave itself had huge caverns, but almost none of the stalactites and stalagmites found in most of the caves I have ever been in. Also only one ""flow"" caused by water near the end of the tour.....so mostly just a bunch of big caves with chunks of limestone lying beside the pathway. I was surprised and disappointed in this....the cave was simply not pretty, and had few geologic areas of interest.There was one interesting place with names and initials done with lantern smoke years ago....of course other more recent fools had carved hearts and initials in stone nearby.Near the end of the 2 miles, and just before the ""firetower"" of 145 stairs to move up from the max depth of 310 feet, there is a bit of dripping water, and this has caused a couple of better water carved formations.Perhaps other tours go to prettier areas of the caverns, or maybe this is just an area without water dripping down from above, but Mammoth Cave was not a pretty or interesting as other caves I have been in.The ""Information Center"" is very nice....a good exhibit, seating, air conditioning, rest rooms, etc.","June 19, 2016","Yes, it is in fact mammoth, but only fairly interesting and not at all beautiful..",347,"Knoxville, Tennessee",4

There was a lot of down time b/c there were a lot of people on the tour and we have to wait for them to catch up each time. The guide was knowledgeable overall.

Mammoth Cave,"You might visit Mammoth Cave National Park just to take a cave tour but there is as much to see above ground as there is below ground. The park is located in western Kentucky, just off I-65. There is no charge to enter the park but there are charges for the various tours of the cave system. If you are not familiar with Mammoth Cave, it is the longest known cave system in the world. The tours that are offered by the park service are of varying length in distance, depth, and time. The number and type of tours change depending on the time of year and, in our case, construction and repairs. You should visit the Mammoth Cave web site and search for tours and schedules and to make reservations. My wife and I opted for the 2 hour Domes & Dripstones Tour for a cost of 15 dollars each. Tickets may be purchased online and picked up at the Visitors Center or you can purchase your ticket there - if there is still space available. I highly recommend that you go to the Visitors Center well before your tour and spend some time there. The museum/education center is outstanding! While the gift shop is small and offers the usual, generic National Park items it also offers items unique to Mammoth Cave. Before the tour, you are warned that you should be in good health as you will make use of about 500 stairs. It's also a bit of a tight fit in several places, especially if you are on the tall side. For this reason (and others) I do not recommend taking children less than 3 years old - 'nuff said. Our tour loaded onto busses near the Visitors Center, and took us to the ""New Entrance"". Our guide, a Park Service Ranger named Rick (no kidding, Ranger Rick), set a brisk pace, which left little time for pictures. BTW - do not try to take pictures while walking: it's too dark and the cave itself doesn't like it and might reach out and smack you on the head. However, when entering into the various chambers and rooms we usually took a break, and we were able to get some good pictures. I also do not recommend taking less than 3 years - 'nuff said. The highlight had to be ""Frozen Niagara"", a massive flowstone 130 feet below the ground surface. All and all, a most enjoyable tour but far too short. I also recommend spending time exploring the park above ground. The trails around the Visitors Center are excellent easy-to-moderate trails. The River Styx, Dixon Cave, and the Green River Gorge are just a few of the places you can visit here. This is one of the most beautiful hardwood forest I have seen in some time. Healthy, dense trees, with a carpet of ferns on the forest floor and occasional limestone outcrops , and plenty of wildlife. If you want more of a challenge, try the trails north of the Green River. There are also three trails in the park that can be accessed by wheelchair. Other activities available include scenic drives, canoeing, horseback riding, and bicycling, just to mention a few. My wife and I intend to return and spend several days in the park - above ground and below ground.As always, at least for me, the Park Service Rangers were the best part of the visit. Exceedingly polite and knowledgeable, they never got tired of questions and always made me feel like they were there just for me. The only short coming was that the restaurant (and hotel) were closed for repairs and updates, requiring us to leave the park in search of food.","June 14, 2016",Incredible below ground and incredible above ground!,30,"Greenville, South Carolina",5

Mammoth Cave,"I really expected a large cave. But being the world's longest cave, instead of one tour, there were five. By the time I got there, most had been sold out, so I took the shorter, Niagara Falls tour. The guide (ranger) was not very talkative, she gave us information at two planned stops. From there on, we were basically on our own, and had some confusion about where to go, but we managed. She would answer questions when asked. Most of the tour was just walking to the one cavern that had the dripstones. Had many of the features we expect from a cave, flowstones, bacon, stalagtites and stalagmites, etc. Lots of stairs and the most narrow route I have ever done. Hit my head on one rock. Don't go if you have joint problems, or can not take narrow places. You will need multiple visits to see it all.","June 14, 2016",More than I expected,259,"Clinton, South Carolina",4

Mammoth Cave,"If you've been to almost any other cave, you will likely find Mammoth Cave rather boring. We did the Domes and Dripstones tour. While the ranger was pretty entertaining, the same can't be said for the actual tour. 90% of the tour consisted on walking through small passages to see...nothing. Just a bunch of rock. It wasn't until the end that we saw anything even approaching interesting. That's when we got to the Frozen Niagara portion, which had lots of formations. But, even that was tempered by the lighting. While most caves have lighting that accentuates the formations, Mammoth Cave just has basic illumination that does nothing to enhance the viewing of the formations. If you've visited Carlsbad Caverns or even Ruby Falls, you will be sorely disappointed. Suggestion: skip the higher priced Domes and Dripstones tour and just go on the Frozen Niagara tour. You'll see the only worthwhile part and save time and money. Maybe the Historic Tour is better. Suggestion #2: When you go on the website, it will steer you to the national parks site to book reservations. But, the Historic tour was not listed as available on the national site, so we booked one of the few remaining tours available. When we arrived at the park, we discovered that the Historic tour was available, but the ranger said it did not show up on the national parks site. What? Most of the tours do fill up a couple of weeks in advance, so it's worth making a reservation if you can figure out what's actually available.","June 13, 2016",Boring,10,"Atlanta, Georgia, United States",2

There are only 2 a day and they sell out weeks in advance. We getting ready to go hiking and they opened up another tour time for the Historic Tour. We had heard this was a good tour. And it is one not to miss. We entered the original cave opening. A lot of steps. This tour has Fat Man Misery and Tall Man Misery. A lot of history. We really enjoyed this tour. The Domes and Dripstones tour was mostly wet cave. This tour was mostly dry cave. I am glad we did not miss the Historic Tour. We climbed the Mammoth Dome tower to return back to the historic entrance. The first tour was good but the second tour really made our visit to the cave. We hiked some of the trails. They were not hard. The rangers were very nice and informative. When we left we took the ferry. Interesting. It only holds 3 cars.

It says it as a warning on their website but they have pictures that don't look scary, these pictures are not of the Domes and Dripstones tour they are from the Historic Tour. Domes and Dripstones you are walking on grated platforms above cliffs (several hundred feet below you is rock). Once you make it down these steps (about 10-15 minutes) the rest of the tour is great. We had a guide named Jerry who is a fifth generation guide, he was fantastic and made the experience enjoyable. However, these tours are very large (over 100 people) if you are not near the front you miss out on the majority of the tour (Jerry talking about things and pointing things out). Worth it if you are not scared of heights, otherwise go on a different tour. Mammoth Caves is very neat-lots to see there and the museum is awesome (watch the videos they explain a lot).

Seniors like us, received a discount for our Golden Eagle passes. The tours are not expensive and many required busing to the entrances used for the tour. Although I've been in caves with better ""dripstone"" formations, this is one of the largest system I've toured and it did have a nice ""dripstone"" section in the Frozen Niagara section.

We took the Domes and Dripstones tour, took about an ur including drive time there and back. Important tip: DON'T BRING BABIES. OR TODDLERS. First leg is 180 narrow, wet steps down in 53 degree (farenheit) air. NARROW, WET, COLD. Kids who are 7 or 8 can take it, can understand instructions. Toddlers will have to be carried. One family brought a BABY who WAS NOT HAPPY. Either leave the pre-kindergarten kids at home or take a less-strenuous tour.First leg, as states, is a long descent. Cold and wet, narrow, but with neat view of caves and providing a WONDERFUL taste of what early cave explorers experienced. Informative, humorous guides. I would have preferred a longer tour, but summer hours had not kicked in yet. My wife says it was all she could handle. 500 steps in all, lots of areas narrow and slick footing. The park describes this as ""moderate"" difficulty. Plan accordingly. Ended with he amazing Frozen Niagara. Definitely recommend this tour.Price was amazingly reasonable. 45 minute, tour of some of the biggest caves available: $15 per person. Kentucky Down Under includes a similar experience, but it costs $25 per person and the cave experience is less than half as long.Remember, caves are same temperature year-round. Nice cool tour on hot summer day; would like to try it as a WARM alternative in winter.","June 9, 2016","Excellent, but leave the baby AT HOME",29,"Lexington, Kentucky",5
Mammoth Cave,"We spent two full days in the park. We toured the cave on two different tours and a hiked several trails and took the Green River ferry just for grins. Our tours were the Cleaveland Avenue Tour and the Domes and Dripstones tour. It appears that a wider variety of tours are offered during the summer. We booked the tours online, well in advance of our going to the park. Both cave tours start with a safety briefing and a 10 minute bus ride to the cave entrance. The Cleaveland Avenue tour starts with a 183 step decent into the cave. The cave has a nearly perfect elliptical shape. There are places on the walk where you can see for quite a distance and get a real appreciation of the formation. This is not a cave full of stalactites and stalagmites but it does have interesting gypsum formations along the one mile route. After a stop in the Snowball room where restroom facilities are available you turnaround and go back the way you came. That includes 183 steps up to reach the bus back to the visitor center. The tour is limited to 38 people and takes 2.5 hours. The Domes and Dripstones Tour has a 280 step decent into the cave with 500 stairs total. The trip through the cave is relatively short. This is the tour that had the most formations I associate with caves. If you do this tour you see everything that is included on the Frozen Niagara Tour. This includes an optional 49 step staircase to the Drapery Room under the frozen Niagara Formation. The exit was one of the easiest parts of the tour. We must have been slowly going uphill through the tour and surprised that we didn't have to climb 280 steps to get out. As many as 114 people may be on the tour with you, but they do an excellent job of keeping everyone together and when it is time to talk to folks about the cave they are able to get the message to everyone on the tour. If you are only able to do one tour, this is the one I would recommend. We did the cave tours in the mornings and hiked in the afternoons. We would have liked to canoe on the Green River, but due to high water no canoes were being put in. There are a number of trails easily accessed from the visitor center. You can do anyone of a number of short trails or you can combine several to make a nice loop through the woods. Over the two days we walked the the Green River Bluffs trail, the Echo River Spring Trail and the Mammoth Dome Sink Trail. The spring flowers were blooming, birds were courting and deer were browsing. It was lovely.","June 9, 2016","A delight, above and below ground",498,"Phoenix, Arizona",5
Mammoth Cave,"This is the second oldest tourist attraction in the US and not only a National Park but a world heritage site. There is no entrance fee like other National parks, but this is probably because you pay for the cave tours. There are several cave tours, the most popular seemed to be the Domes and Dripstones tour as it had the most available times. Cost is $15pp. You can book a tour on line, we were able to walk in and sign up for the 11am one. There is a museum in the visitor center as well as a gift store, information booth. The Domes and Dripstones cave tour lasted about 2 hrs. Though rated as moderate, it may be strenuous for those not used to lots of stairs up and down. There were several stops on the tour where you can sit on benches while the ranger talked about the cave. There are no restrooms. The tour was crowded with 120 people and two Rangers, one leading, one in the back. Those in the back missed some information but overall the Rangers did a great job and the cave is spectacular. Bring a light jacket if you get cold, though the stairs definitely get you sweating! We brought small flashlights which were helpful. After the tour you can walk down a hill to the historic cave entrance. There is also a historic tour which takes you there, but it was full. A lodge and restaurant are nearby if you need food. It is so amazing that hundreds of miles of caves exist under this park and that Mammoth Cave is only a small part! If you are just passing through, it is still possible to stop and take a tour if you plan it right as the park is only about 7-10miles from I65.","June 8, 2016",Visit this National Park!,239,United States,5

We saw so many people arrive without reservations and were unable to go on any tours the day we went. There is one self-guided tour that is available, but I'm sure it doesn't do the cave justice if you really want to experience this cave system.

Mammoth Cave,"We went on 2 separate cave tours. The Historic Tour and the Dome and Dripstone's Tour Each tour lasted about 2 hours and were about $15 per person. They take you from the Visitor Center by bus to the cave openings, They are guided tours by a Park Ranger who has the the answers for everything. It was amazing of how all of the formations are formed over the years and was very memorable. These tours are good for both adults and kids. Beware.. you don't have to be in Super-Shape but It can be strenuous as there are some stairs to climb up and down, plus trails to walk on inside the caves. The Ranger was very patient for visitors who were slow. Someday I would like to go on the Wild Cave Tour which is 6 hours long and 5 miles in length.. now that's when I get into tip top shape.

They only do like 3-6 tours of the most popular caves a day. I was disappointed that me, like most people, weren't aware that these sell out weeks in advance. It sucks to drive all the way there to find out you can't see it. It's the only national park I've been to where I wasn't able to see the attraction. Anyway, there are lots of other caves in the area that were easier to get a tour to see.

We arrived 1/2 hour before the tours ended and enjoyed the visitor center which told us all about the limestone, the river and the shifting of the equator did you know it was once in KY, I didn't... Then to the caves, as you approach you can start to feel the cold on your ankles, it was amazing then a few steps closer you step from the humidity into an outdoor airconditioner. The campground was also very nice, clean facilities, showers cost $3, there is a post office on site and a store and laundry facility.

Mammoth Cave,"We did two cave tours while we were here, the “Domes and Dripstones” as well as the “Cleaveland Avenue” tour. The only way to tour the caves is by signing up for the tours; there are no self-guided tours. What this means is that if you want to go in the caves, you should buy your tickets online and well in advance of your arrival. We stopped at Subway so we could have lunch after our first tour (food options very limited in most National Parks, including this one), and our schedule was 10:30a Domes and Dripstones, a quick lunch at the picnic area across the street from the ranger station (drive there), and then the 1:15p Cleaveland Avenue Tour. We really enjoyed both tours and I highly recommend doing both. The Domes and Dripstones starts by walking down a couple hundred steps, and then touring the caves with a few stops along the way. Lots of rock formations and cave facts, and we found it scenic and interesting. Most of the tour is slightly uphill, so there were hardly any steps (maybe 50?) at the final exit of the cave, and overall I would consider this an easy hike. The Cleaveland Avenue tour is a down and back tour, meaning you go down 180 steps, walk a mile in the cave, and then turn around and come back out. The stairs are fairly shallow and designed to be easy, so this should not be any concern for most people. There was one person in the group who had to stop a couple times on the way up, and the rangers were hugely supportive and helpful. Loved both tours, although I did like Cleaveland Avenue better. Perhaps it was because the group was much smaller (30 vs 100), but I also found Cleaveland avenue to be more interesting and understandable, although doing both is my recommendation. Cleaveland Avenue tour only did 2 groups of 30 each on the day we were there – buy tickets in advance!","June 2, 2016","Tours needed to see the caves; buy tickets in advance, especially Cleaveland Ave.",275,"Ann Arbor, Michigan",5

The canteen is not good enough to have food but they have good restaurant in Cave city which is just 3/4 miles from the national park4. They have a very good hiking trail if you like to walk and see the green river (the cave water system)5.

Mammoth Cave,"Took our 10- and 13-year olds on this your. We all enjoyed the amazing walk through the caves. A normal activity level for us and neither kid was bothered by the steps, narrow passages or lighting...but the school trip on our tour was! Heard a lot of whining from them about the steps. In fact, I would encourage the park to take the school trips separately from other guests. In the part of the tour where the Rangers turn out the lights so you can experience complete darkness and silence (they give plenty of warning), the kids on the tour were screaming, shrieking and being what they thought was hilarious. Without concern for anyone else (of course, they are kids) and without any reprimand from their teachers. Otherwise, fun tour. Rangers were so welcoming and handled the children as best they could. Willing to listen to all questions. You can't really hear the Rangers on the walking part of the tour (mostly single file walking) but the group stops a few times and you can easily hear their info then. Also, picnic area and trails in the park. Nice gift shops and restroom facilities. All made for an enjoyable 3 to 4-hour road trip stop.

But even with the sizable crowd, the tour was quite informative, offering a succinct history of the cave. The tour lasted about 2 hours, with about 1 1/2 hours being in the cave itself. The visitor center is also quite nice with a number of informative videos and displays. But if you go to Mammoth Cave you have to take the tour.

They seemed unflappable. Kids throwing up - babies crying - lights not working. They took it all in stride. It was Bobby's last tour though. Headed to retirement. Only downside was - we like to hike so went across the river to some longer trails. All trails seem to allow horses and were muddy messes in many areas from the horses.

We had made on-line reservations ahead of time and it was easy to pick up our tickets. After a picnic lunch we went to the tour area and waited our turn. After an informative and at times amusing orientation we took the bus to the cave entrance. After a brief intro and preview of what to expect and some do's and don'ts the guide asked if we had any questions. My granddaughter told him that she had done the report and the guide told her that she would be assistant and she got to be at the head of the line. Since she was able to ask questions (and did) easily she really enjoyed the tour. Toward the end of the tour there was an optional side tour. The guide stepped to the side and told our granddaughter that she would be the tour guide for the side tour. She was very happy with this considerate gesture on the part of the tour guide. Be sure to reserve ahead of time, wear comfortable walking shoes, and a sweater/jacket that can be removed. The railings can be damp, some of the passages are narrow with low ceilings.

Mammoth Cave,"Prior to the Memorial Day weekend there were only three cave tours being run. One we had already taken on a previous visit, so that left the Frozen Niagara Tour and the Dripstones and Domes Tour. Since the Dripstones tour is considerably longer, includes the entire Frozen Niagara Tour, and only costs $2 more, it seemed the better choice. As we gathered for the tour and our ranger, Jacob explained how strenuous it was going to be, encouraging anyone with medical issues to strongly consider this choice, I realized that this was not a good choice for me. I told my boy friend I thought I should stay behind. He insisted I'd be fine, and he would ""help"" me get through it. I tried to tell him that didn't make sense, but he pointed out that I'd managed similar tours in the past. I let him cajole me into it, even though I was sure it was a bad idea. By the time we got to the bottom of the 280 steep steps that get you down into this cave I knew I was in a world of trouble. My legs were so weak they wouldn't even hold me up. They never did get better, and it was only the patience and calm assistance of the assistant guide, Bobby, and an EMT whose name I did not catch, that eventually got me out of that cave. These folks were very professional and were very kind, but they did ask the obvious question: What could we have said to keep you from going in there? I told them that some of us have difficulty saying ""NO"" to the people we love - so all I can pass on to others in the future is don't let yourself be talked into trying this if your instincts are telling you no. It is a beautiful tour, and if you are in good shape by all means go and enjoy. If you have any issues with heart, lungs, back, or knees, go on the Frozen Niagara Tour instead.

Mammoth Cave,"My family and I have been to many National Parks and it is one of our favorite things to do. Mammoth Cave offered a Domes and Dripstone Tour, which is the one we decided to take. Please be aware that advance reservations are a necessity - we saw many people turned away trying to get same day reservations.Our tour was in the morning and was full - about 120 people in it. The Ranger was great about explaining what was expected for this tour - be able to climb about 500 steps, don't go if you're uncomfortable being in small spaces (there weren't many and they weren't too bad), don't go if you can't get your children through it, and if you have any health problems. The Ranger offered a refund to anyone who wanted to back out since the tickets had not been torn - no one left. We were taken to the cave entrance via bus, but one of them had broken down so all of us had to crowd in on two buses, but it was only about a 5 minute drive.When we got to the cave one of the children started throwing up. A ranger went to help and the family decided to stay - I was shocked they were able to go in the cave with a young one vomiting. I could not believe how many young children went on this tour. It was really hard to hear the Ranger over all of the crying and screaming children. About half way through the tour we were told to sit in an area that was not on the tour because one of the families was having trouble and had to leave the tour. We lost our second Ranger while she stayed with them until a replacement could come. We were able to get back to the visitor center on time, but I felt like the tour was rather rushed. We found out that this is a National Heritage site so we asked a ranger what this meant. He said he had no idea. We asked another and another and not one ranger knew what that meant for the park. Our 12 year old loves the Junior Ranger program and had found a Cave Scientist program through the NPS website and so we asked about it - none of the Rangers had any idea about this program.Out of all of the national parks we have visited, the Rangers here were very unknowledgeable and very overwhelmed with the crowd. Some were nice, but unable to answer any questions.It seems like a lot of complaining, but we did have a good time and it is an impressive site, but the only disappointment we have ever had with any of the National Parks.

Mammoth Cave,"Based on the time of the season, we only had the option of taking a guided tour. If I were to do it again, I would opt to go after Memorial Day when self guided tours are allowed. Our ""group"" consisted of over 110 people, which was way too much for the two tour guides (one in front and one bringing up the rear). You only have about 3 stops where the tour guide talks for a few minutes. The rest of the time you are walking in single file. If you stop to take a picture, you hold up the entire line. There were a few spots when you could get out of line to take photos but then the guide bringing up the rear starts to corral you to keep up. The sights within the cave are good but if you've been to Luray Caverns, you may be disappointed. We did the Domes and Dripstone tour (about 280 steps down and 220 step up). The down steps occur all at the beginning. You gradually walk up (combination of slopes and steps) on the upward trek while you see the sights.

The tour is very short, and very accessible -- there are steep stairs near the end, but there are railings on all sides and it is very safe for all ages/abilities (unless you're afraid of the dark like an unsuspecting child on our tour). The formations are very unique and our guide Terry was phenomenal. You take a short bus ride to the entrance of the tour, and overall it is an hour including the drive round trip.

Mammoth Cave,"Over the years, we have taken many cave tours and Mammoth Cave ranks close to the bottom. We did the Domes and Drips tour. Number one it was fairly strenuous, with multiple stairs, irregular ramps both upward and downward. There were a lot of handrails but in some spots there were none and you were warned not to touch the walls (as if people listened to that as they were stumbling), There were between 75 and 100 people, so you could never hear what little the ranger said. We did stop twice in a mile to hear a short 5 minute talk. We were advised initially that this would be at a brisk pace, which it was. Combined with the rough surface and the brisk pace, you were unable to stop and actually look at anything. We had scheduled another tour for Wed and I doubt that we will bother. My recommendations would be to do some research and visit some caves in Missouri or Colorado......","May 23, 2016",Other caves are more satisfying to visit,21,"Punta Gorda, Florida",3
Mammoth Cave,"We thoroughly enjoyed this 2 Hr tour in the cave. There were around 60 people on the tour, too many but better than it could have been since the max is 120. One of us has a heart condition but it was fine since the majority of consecutive steps were down. The cave is beautiful, especially the Frozen Niagara portion, but we liked it all. Our ranger Ethan was fantastic. Difficult to takes pictures because of limited light. Advice to parents: please don't take wiggly chattery kids it's distracting, and crying babies are not appropriate. Wish they would offer a limited participant photo tour!","May 23, 2016",Domes and Dripstones tour,71,"Miami, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"We took the shortest tour which is approximately 45 minutes in the cave itself. However you have to take a shuttle to the entrance so schedule around an hour and a half for the tour. Plus extra time to visit the original entrance, the visitors center, and walk some of the great trails. The part of the cave we toured was the least strenuous but still very impressive. I wish I didn't have a crazy fear of heights so we could have taken one of the longer tours.","May 23, 2016",Frozen Niagra,23,Cleveland,5
Mammoth Cave,"We are traveling across country in an rv and stayed the night at the campground. Sites were nicely maintained, restrooms were clean and with the exception of a group of Boy Scouts it was quiet. The next day we did a tour of the cave. We are traveling with our dog and were worried about leaving her unattended in the rv parked at the visitors center. Emily, a national park service ranger, let us stay parked at the campsite well past checkout time and did periodic checks on our dog to make sure she was well. Our tour guide was great and added much humor to his topics. Great stay and thank you to the national park service. ","May 22, 2016","Friendly, clean and accomodating",1,"Fiskdale, Massachusetts",5
Mammoth Cave,"This was more a last minute vacation for us and we weren't able to snatch up one of the more in depth tours that you have to book way in advance. We ended up with the Frozen Niagara tour that is going about a hour. There is otherwise no other chance to really get into the caves and see them. So the earlier you can book the better. We liked the caves and had fun, but the tour seemed very rushed. It felt like we had to leave earlier, since another tour was coming from deeper in the caves and needed to occupy the same space in order to finish up their part of the tour and get out of the main entrance/exit. I wish we would have had a chance to go a little deeper into the caves (not sure if we would have seen more without the tour coming out).Overall, the caves are beautiful and if we ever go there again, I would make sure to go and book a more in depth tour.","May 20, 2016",plan ahead and book the tours,157,"Seattle, Washington",4
Mammoth Cave,"Despite trying to book the various tours ahead of time, we were completely unable to get tickets for any of the main tours, and ended up doing the free 'self-tour' which entered the cave to the main junction, and not much further. Even that little bit was very impressive and definitely worth the walk down and back. We did look through the museum at the visitor's center also.Apparently, this attraction is so busy, even in the 'off' season, that you need to book -and verify!- your reservations quite a bit ahead of time.There are also a number of walking trails which few people were doing, which were also interesting- that led to a number of cave-related features such as sink holes, springs flowing from the caves, and numerous other small cracks and entrances to the cave system.","May 20, 2016","Visited with friends, were blocked-out from the 'main' tours",132,"Raleigh, NC",4

They had a store and laundry on the grounds. Would stay there again. The only reason I gave it a 4 was because there is only 3 showers for all the campers.If you plan a cave tour, I would get your tickets ahead of time, since they usually sell out. We did 1 cave tour, and it was amazing. We will be going back again someday...","May 19, 2016",Camping and cave tour,2,,4
Mammoth Cave,"We went on the domes and dripstones tour and we absolutely loved it! Our tour guide was very knowledgable and answered all of our questions. There is a nice path throughout this cave route that made it easy to walk through. Some parts of the cave were very narrow and I would not suggest this for people that are scared of being in tighter areas for any amount of time. There were a few areas that required the travelers to duck their heads. The cave is a constant cool temperature of about 58 F so we were comfortable in our tees and shorts (We are Chicago residents). However, the cave is very humid and the stone path can get very slippery in some areas so I would recommend wearing good soled shoes or hiking boots. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our guided cave tour at the National Park and we will return soon!","May 19, 2016",Adventurous!,8,,4
Mammoth Cave,We visited the park on Jr Ranger day and were not disappointed. We explored two areas of the cave. Our 7 year old really enjoyed herself.

Mammoth Cave,"On a lengthy road trip, I made sure to plan a stop here. We didn't have the right timing to do anything but the 1 hour Frozen Niagara tour, but that alone has spoiled all other cave attractions forever. The rangers are all very friendly, super knowledgeable, and very entertaining. There is so much to do here! I wish we'd had more time. Multiple tours (even when the historic entrance was closed), a great little museum with movies and infographics. A beautiful surrounding. When you enter the cave, there are gigantic critters that look like spiders crawling everywhere. Perhaps the ranger could have told me sooner that they were benign ""cave crickets"" and not spiders. I had half a mind to flee screaming at the top of my lungs. But that just added to the overall delight at this place.This is really a place you have to go to if you at all like caves.","May 19, 2016",Jaw dropping,4,Madison,5

Mammoth Cave,"We went on the Domes & Dripstones tour. Be sure to purchase your tickets in advance online if possible (many of the tour times were sold out).There are many tours through Mammoth Cave. We chose this one because of the duration (about 2 hours) and the length (3/4th mile). Now that may not sound like a long distance, but that doesn't include the vertical distances either!First, before you leave the visitor center: USE THE RESTROOM!!! There are no bathrooms anywhere on this tour.After a ten minute bus ride from the visitor center, you start by entering a steel door in the side of the hill out in the woods- reminds me of the bunker they found in the ""Lost"" TV show. About 120 people can go on the tour, but they allowed half of us to enter at a time into this ""air lock."" Once they shut the door behind us, they opened the deeper door and we began our descent. There are about 280 steps down into this sinkhole that spiral and curve. There are many places that I had to turn sideways and lean over to go down the steps. Being that I am 6'6"" tall, I had to duck in many places. The steps and handrails are moist so you have to be careful- I didn't hear of anyone slipping though.A word about claustrophobia- being that I am so tall, there are many places where I feel trapped and will start freaking out after a couple minutes (like MRI machines). They warned us several times about claustrophobia on this tour. The only times I felt mildly claustrophobic were in the air lock at the beginning, the spiraling descent at the beginning, and one section of cave about 100 feet long where I had to squat down and walk through a tunnel with a cage on one side). Really it wasn't bad at all. Most of the other places we walked (and sometimes sat) were in large, open spaces. NOTE: to help with the claustrophobia, be the first one on the first bus and sit at the front- then when you get out, follow the park ranger and guide so you will be right behind him the entire time. If I hadn't done this, I think I may have experienced quite a bit of claustrophobia when people move slowly and hold up the line.If you've been to other caverns or caves where they use colored lighting to show off their features (these are called ""Show Caves"") you may be surprised that there is only plain white/yellowish lighting throughout the whole cave. Toward the end of this tour, you have the option of going down an additional two flights of stairs at the Frozen Niagara formation to the drapery room- even though your legs will be tired at this time, suck it up and do it! Speaking of- you are allowed to take bottled water on the tour. I would definitely suggest this!Finally, be sure to tour around the visitor center- I'd do this before your tour if time permits since it explains so much about the cave system. If you have trouble climbing stairs or walking a long distance, find another tour!One last thing- the cave is a constant 54 degrees. I would suggest wearing a hoodie, sweatshirt, or light jacket!","May 14, 2016",Consider the Domes & Dripstones Tour- you'll be glad you did!,35,"Arlington, Texas",4

Mammoth Cave,I have always wanted to visit mammoth caves and finally had the opportunity. It was great! Don't think it's a walk in the park though! Our group had 112 people...but that was not a problem..actually it helped me because the decent to the bottom was slower which number one gave me more time to navigate the stairs and second to see the surroundings better. Trust me it is a workout for someone who isn't in great physical shape. Lots and lots of stairs...encountered a couple of large spiders at the entrance...suggest wearing a hat or hood...nothing the rest of the trip...our guide ranger John was very good..answered all our questions..it was a great experience...even the drive into the park is beautiful...we saw lots of turkeys and a few deer...we walked to the natural entrance the day before and it is beautiful and a pretty walk through the trees...def check yourself for ticks after your adventure...the ranger said they drop from the trees and sure enough I had a tiny one on my leg.

A moderate amount of walking is involved, but the tour is not too strenuous. If you are claustrophobic, you might want to skip it however since there are some pretty tight spots. Make sure to wear good sneakers with decent grips, since there are some wet areas that are a little slick. I would definitely go again if I was in the area.

Yes there are many steps but they are spread out. The Rangers may warn you if you are afraid of heights or tight spaces, not to go. No way! There are rails on the majority of the trails and it is more of having to stoop down due to a low ceiling. My 62 yo mother who I call the lazy Mo did it with no problem, and she doesn't like to walk.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Caves is one of the must-sees in the National Park system. The Visitor's Center is very well done, and while it has two small gift shop areas, it is not overwhelmed by cheesy, neon tourist knickknacks. An educational walk through is there and provides information on every aspect of the cave system.We first went on a short, ranger-led hike. Ranger Jim was very funny and very knowledgeable about the history of the area - from its connection to Native Americans to its mining history to private tours for the wealthy to the slaves who were really the first explorers of the caves. We followed this with the Domes and Dripstones tour - one of the moderate tours with hundreds of stairs and some sloped trails. I have arthritis in both of my knees, but I found I was able to do this trip with very little discomfort. Ranger Jim was again our leader and regaled us with more history, geology, and silly jokes. The amount of formations/decorations is limited; it is the sheer size of these caverns that is truly awesome. Be careful of speeding in the Park. A ranger warned us that 1 mile over the speed limit is a $175 ticket. (However, the speed limit does not apply to the bus drivers who take you to the cave tour entrances, so HOLD ON!) Entrance to the park is free, as was our guided hike. Cave tours range in price and difficulty.","May 3, 2016",Wish We Had Done More Tours,41,"Saginaw, Michigan",5

Mammoth Cave,"The Frozen Niagara Tour was our choice because we weren't sure how strenuous the walk would be and how I would do climbing a little over 100 stairs. As it turned out, the paths had rails to hold, the paths were easy to follow, it was the perfect length and even the small children in our group were able to enjoy the tour. It is low light and some parts are narrow and you must duck (I'm 5'3"" and I had to duck several times) so if you get claustrophobic or have problems with being in the dark for the short time the Ranger turns off the lights, maybe this isn't a good fit for you. We loved it and will be taking the longer tour next trip through. After you purchase ticket at the visitor center, the tour starts at one of the outside pavilions. You board a bus and it takes you to the entrance of the cave. Be sure you save time to walk through the visitor center displays and learn about the caves first visitors.

Mammoth Cave,"The nice thing about thing about National Park (as opposed to others) is that you can enter the park for free. There is a charge for the tours but that's understandable. We were here in April 2016. Needed reservations ahead of time to get the times we wanted for two of the only three tours that were being offered. We did Cleveland the first day with Ranger Jerry who's ancestors were some of the first tour guides in the 1800's. He did a very nice tour and made Cleveland a good introduction to the cave system. It was a 2 1/2 hr tour with a total of 211 steps down (counting from the bus) and then of course 211 back up. But you can come back up the stairs slowly as Ranger Jerry stops for a rest too, er I mean to point out something important! You walk down and come back the same route. Not a lot to look at really but Ranger Jerry made it more interesting than it would have been. Then we did Niagara Falls the following day with only 6 steps unless you choose the optional 90 something other steps. You go down and back in the same trail here. This time we had Ranger Jim who did a good job but was less of a story teller than Ranger Jerry. This tour was 1 hr 15 min including the bus ride too and was more spectacular inside than Cleveland. Although we did see a bat in Cleveland. Very sad, they've lost over 80% of their bats due to a disease that was inadvertently introduced nation wide. As a result, you will walk across a disinfectant carpet on the way out to help reduce spread of the disease. Glad we did the cave.

I had total knee replacement surgery 9 months ago, and I did just fine. The temperature inside the cave was 54 degrees and 80% humidity. I'm usually always hot, so I did not take a coat or jacket and was just fine. There were handrails throughout the tour and our tour guide, Ranger Bobby Beam, was delightful.

It's too bad they have to put up heavy wire around some of their most beautiful structures. I understand, but it truly detracts from the experience.

It;s an enormous place (more than 360 miles of cave) so, be prepared, you won't see it all in one day.","April 20, 2016",Incredible,1,Okolona,5
Mammoth Cave,"My wife and I recently drove to Mammoth Cave just to get out of our house in Lexington. An easy and beautiful 1 hour drive from our home. While there was not much traffic on the access roads from the Bluegrass Parkway, there certainly were quite a few visitors once we arrived. The park fills up quickly. We took the 2 hour Cleveland Avenue Tour and enjoyed it tremendously. There are about 180 stairs to access this entrance but once in the cave the path is level, smooth and easy. Please note that you must climb the same stairs to exit although the guide stops a few times to rest.The National Park Service guide did a wonderful job for our group of 32. He made the trip informative and fun. Well worth the $16 fee. Please be advised that most of the various Cave Tours fill up in advance and it is HIGHLY Advised to buy your tickets on line well in advance. The web site is very accurate in their tour descriptions. There are many levels and types of tours at several entrances to this 400 mile system of tunnels and caves. There are also several enjoyable hiking paths of several lengths above ground. This is a full service National Park with camping and rental options, with camp stores and all facilities. There is also a very nice Visitors Center with an interesting museum and frequent hands on activities.","April 20, 2016",A Stroll in the Park (Above and Below Ground),30,"Lexington, Kentucky",4
Mammoth Cave,"This is a must see!I was surprised by the entrance to the cave with Niagara Falls because it really just looked like a door into the mountain however once I walked inside I began to become amazed as I stepped into the twists and turns of the cave system. While not a strenuous walk, due to the dampness in places, the tight spaces, the steps this tour is not for everyone. However, if you are able to make it the sights are so worth it. At every turn I was amazed by the beauty and wonders of the cave system. Frozen Niagara and the curtains were incredible.The historic entrance was more in line with the entrance I was expecting -- a large natural cave entrance. This cave is grand and opens up into an area that is like a theater. It was quite impressive to see how large an area was open inside the cave. They had interesting artifacts that had been dicovered in the cave in cases.After the tours, we enjoyed the visitor center and my son completed the book to get his Junior Ranger badge.We camped overnight at the campground and was pleasantly surprised that we had free WiFi access. Bathrooms are available at the campground but you have to pay to get a shower at the hotel. Great visit. Highly recommend and would do it again.","April 19, 2016",Camping trip with Scouts,1,"Knoxville, Tennessee",5
Mammoth Cave,"The historic cave entrance is currently closed for improvements so we took the Domes and Dripstones tour and it was amazing, you get to see Frozen Niagara which was the highlight of the tour to us. Some of the staircases are over very deep caves, maybe 100 feet. Kind of fun scary. Some parts are are tight for big people. I'm 6'3"", 275 but pretty lean, if someone was obese I would pause before taking this tour. Jason(Bratcher??) our Ranger was funny, really nice and he and I hit it off talking about historical fiction, really, really nice young man. My 68 yr old mother as well as my 6yr old both loved it.","April 16, 2016",Domes and Dripstones tour was awesome,25,"Ashland, Kentucky",5

(That was tongue in cheek BTW)We chose some of the area smaller caves and sites and were very happy we did.If we ever go back, and we feel like being part of a hundred in a group, we will definitely get a reservation (assuming haven't stopped this nonsense first.)","April 12, 2016",Couldn't do the tour.,2,"Meadville, Pennsylvania",1

Mammoth Cave,We went on the Cleveland Avenue Tour and it was fine. The history was wonderful to learn. The tour itself wasn't difficult. We saw a bat when we entered. I suggest watching the bat video in the back right corner of the information center first. White Nose Syndrome is horrible and the video is very informative. We also hiked several miles around the information center before our tour started. The trails are well marked and easy to follow. You should note this park is in Central Time. We didn't realize the time zone changed in the middle of Kentucky.,"April 11, 2016",Wonderful information center and park,23,"Phoenix, Arizona",5
Mammoth Cave,"We visited Mammoth Cave National Park the last day of March during Spring Break vacation, the weather was perfect. We took the Domes & Dripstones tour - very cool! The rangers were very informative and made sure everyone in our group (est. 100 people) were involved and accounted for. Please make sure you allow enough time to tour the main visitor center and walk around - there is a lot to see outside of just the caves! Unfortunately there are only a few cave tours available in the Spring season. I would love to visit this place in late summer, when all tour options area available.A few tips and suggestions: - book your tour(s) online and EARLY. Don't wait, even a few weeks out, to book your tours. They fill up fast and often. If considering a cave tour, book as far ahead as possible! - wear comfortable shoes that have a GRIP. Avoid flip-flops or sandals. Boots aren't necessary unless you're taking one of the more advanced tours. - for those traveling from Eastern states, remember the 1-hour time difference! We booked it to the visitor's center thinking we were late for our tour, only to find we arrived an hour early (doh!). - the temperature in the caves is ambient, no jackets or sweatshirts needed. Shorts and t-shirts were just fine. In fact, after an hour of walking, we were shedding layers to keep cool. - enjoy lunch outside at the Caver's Camp Store - a few hundred feet from the main visitor's center. We enjoyed grilled hamburgers, pulled pork sandwiches and hot dogs - complete with chips and a drink - for a very reasonable price. A great way to extend your stay, and much better than a chain restaurant off the freeways.","April 10, 2016",Awe inspiring cave experience - every bit as awesome as advertised!,112,"Caledonia, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,Reserve tour tickets online well in advance before you go. All but 3-4 tours were sold out when we got there at 8:30. By 9 they were all sold out.

Mammoth Cave,"CALL AND RESERVE BEFORE YOU GO. Brought a few teens to camp over a cold weekend. We tent camped in Loop B which was nice. Some road noise. Restrooms were clean and warm. No showers in the restrooms. Showers are a short walk away at camp store. The camp store on property was nice when our gas stove sprung a leak. Store has some camp items and groceries. Campground was clean. We set up 4 tents and had ample room. All sites had a nice concrete table and a fire ring with grill top. Wood was sparse so find some before you arrive. We were at B43 and a water spicket was found about 50 yards away. Neighbors were between 25 and 30 feet away. Lights out is 10 pm and most folks complied. The areas are mostly treed so hammocks are well received. Some sites have gravel pads (A loop) and others have grass (B loop). B Loop seemed the nicer for us. We took the Cleveland Avenue tour in the morning with tour guides Terry and Jacob who were polite, fun and knowledgable. I think Terry is ending his career with the Park Services soon, so we wish him well. Lots of disappointed folks arrived to find the tours sold out, and I think that's where a lot of bad reviews come from. All the Rangers we met were helpful and polite. The museum was well done. No food or drinks allowed inside. You won't find a snack bar or lunch spot here so bring your own picnic or eat before you arrive. When I returned to the ticket counter in the afternoon for 6 tickets to the self guided tour, the ticket agent told me they just had a cancellation of exactly 6 people for an afternoon sold out Domes and Dripstones tour. I said yes and we got to see one of the best tours on the property. Jacob and Terry were our able guides again. As you would expect, getting 120 people on buses and through a sometimes single file tour only inches wide, is quite an endeavor, but our fellow guests and our tour guides were patient, polite and eager. There was some waiting at the entrance to get in, but after that things moved at a decent pace. The Domes tour was more strenuous than the Cleveland Avenue tour. The tours were well guided with lots of great information and the guides beg you to ask questions. Between tours we had lunch on the grounds in their roomy picnic area. We will return again with our sights on the other tours. Thanks to the park rangers for such a pleasant visit.

Mammoth Cave,"We booked the Domes and Dripstones tour. It was 2 hours and a good distance/time. We had a very knowledgeable guide. It was very tight in many spaces. Great experience. Luckily we were told by a friend to book ahead since they were sold out on all tours. We didn't know, however, there was a time change from where we traveled from. There are several trails to explore around the park as well. Would highly recommend.","April 10, 2016","Great tour, beautiful park!",2,"Rockford, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"A change in plans allowed us to stop at Mammoth Caves. Of course we had no reservations and all tours were sold out, even on a freezing cold April day.Even without reservations, you can go on the self-guided Discovery Tour. It's easy, right at the visitor center and gives you a good feel for what the caves are like.Also, the ranger let us know that half the tickets for the Frozen Niagara tours are held for same day sale and go on sale at 8am. (The rest have already been sold.) We were staying overnight at the campground so I decided to do this. At 8am I was 20th in line! They sell 16 tickets for each of the 3 times, so I was able to get on the 10am tour. Frozen Niagara is interesting because it's an area of formations, and that's unusual for Mammoth. As everyone says, if you know when you want to visit, make reservations!!","April 9, 2016",Same day tours,36,W. Mass.,5
Mammoth Cave,"The 2 hour tour takes you through the highs and lows of the caves. The frozen Niagara formation is towards the end of the tour and is beautiful. The guide was pretty knowledgable and captivating in his storytelling. As noted in some of the other reviews, it is really a large group. We managed to keep up ahead with the guide and were able to hear the stories but there were people at the end of the queue who hardly heard a thing or got a chance to rest up! Also, compared with some of the other underground caves I've visited, there are hundreds of steps; so please be mindful of that before choosing this tour. Advance booking is recommended. Overall, we enjoyed the experience and the trek within the caves. ","April 9, 2016",Domes and drip stones tour was good,5,,4
Mammoth Cave,"Traveling back from Florida I had the sudden desire to go to Mammoth Cave since our teen-ager had never been. Poor planning on my part made the tours limited for us to experience. The only tour available was the self-guided discovery tour at $5/person this was a great deal and we were able to experience the vastness of this caving system. It truly whetted our appetite to come back and see more! In speaking with one of the park rangers (who, btw, are readily available around almost every corner) she mentioned to check on specialty tours before our next trip. These are tours of the caves that are available on a limited basis annually. My favorite tour is the Frozen Niagra tour and had we planned ahead we may have been able to experience it.

Mammoth Cave,"This tour takes you through the various life stages of Mammoth Cave with very knowledgeable guides and opportunities to ask questions. The tour involves nearly 500 steps, including more than 300 steps down into parts of the cave. The tour culminates in an awesome view of the frozen Niagara Falls formation, and offers great photography ops for cameras that work in low light without a flash.

Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I have been visiting Mammoth Cave since we were kids. We've made trips here as a young married couple. And now in our early middle years, we're sharing the joy of this park with our children. This place is one of the best National Parks near the Midwest. There is no gate fee and everything else in the park is so reasonably priced.  Primitive camping offers wooded sites at very affordable rates. This visit was the first time we haven't camped, only because it was a side trip on the way back from Florida and we didn't have room for the camping equipment. But I highly recommend the camp sites. The best part is they are within an easy walking distance of the visitor center. Within the last five years they have completely renovated the center, adding a great educational area within informative displays and interactive exhibits: mostly geared towards kids age 8 and up. This trip, we decided to book the Domes and Dripstones Tour. Unfortunately, we thought it was a new tour that we hadn't done before but we were wrong. It is the New Entrance Tour with a different name. Also, they changed the name of the Grand Avenue Tour to something I can't recall. BE SURE TO BOOK YOUR TOUR IN ADVANCE. DO NOT RISK IT. We love to fly by the seat of our pants, but you just can't do it here. The D&D tour was the perfect length for my four year old boy, but the rest of us (kids ages 15, 10, 10, and 6) wished for longer. Side note: definitely make time to stop and takes pics at all the ridiculous gift shops and museums on your way into the park.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave is one of our family's favorite destinations. This time we took the Cleveland Ave. tour and the Domes and Dripstones tour. The Cleveland Ave. tour is a good tour for families and gives you a real idea of just how big this cave really is. However, if you are looking for lots of stalactites and stalagmites, this is not the tour for you. Be warned, there are two hundred stairs down, which isn't bad, but you have to go back up those stairs at the end of the tour. The Domes and Dripstones tour was really fun with a staircase that takes you down 300 stairs and lots of twists and turns. This tour is not for anyone that is afraid of heights or tight spaces. One problem was that there were so many people on the tour that the guide was difficult to hear most of the time.","March 31, 2016",Cave Tours!,53,"Dyer, Indiana",5

Mammoth Cave,"We have been studying the 50 states and when we got to Kentucky, my boys discovered Mammoth Caves and asked when we could go there to check it out. So a trip was planned...including a cave tour! We purchased tickets ahead of time on line (something I definitely recommend doing, UNLESS you are military...then you need to wait until you are in town to purchase so you can get the discount...but you'll want to go a day ahead of when you want to go, if possible, to be guaranteed a tour time) Anyhow, the drive in to the visitor center was beautiful and we later found out, we had been driving over many of the 400 miles of caves! We enjoyed the informational section/movie in the visitor center before we went on our tour. Be sure to use the restrooms before you board the bus, because there are no restrooms on this tour.It was incredible to walk down the stairs and narrow walkways (don't do if you are claustrophobic!) and see the beauty of the caves. You can not take flash pictures, so it might be easier to leave your camera in the car. The few pictures I took did not turn out well because of the darkness. It was quite a trek down to the bottom of the cave, but it was worth it. My boys (ages 12, 9, and 7) kept up just perfectly with the group. There were several different aspects of the caves, and so that was a neat feature. Our favorite was towards the end with the stalactite and stalagmite formations. If you are looking for a tour where you can hear the guide talking, do not take this one. Because there are over 100 people on the tour, and the walkways are so narrow (only 1 person fits through at a time), it is impossible to hear what the guide is saying. You do stop a few times and can hear him then, but it is not a audio tour.Overall, this was a great opportunity to see part of the 400 miles of caves in Kentucky. I would recommend it -- and if we come back, we'll check out another tour to see more portions of the caves!","March 30, 2016",Domes and Dripstone Tour,28,"Fayetteville, North Carolina",5
Mammoth Cave,"Although the USA's collection of National Parks is maybe a bit limited after the first five or six big name parks, this one proves that at least the right ones have been selected to represent America's nature. The caves themselves are of course the highlight, and while it is packed, they are worth it. We did the Domes and Dripstones Tour and had a great time. As the tour guide explains at the beginning of the tour, the line of people tends to move like an accordion, as the line moves in waves as people either stop for pictures or get slowed down by the natural chokepoints. This means that it is best to be at the very front of the line, to hear what the tour guide has to say, or to be at the end of the line, which leaves a lot more time for taking pictures. There is a lot more to see at the park as well, with a few surface trails, and these are worth checking out. We showed up at the wrong time for our tour (it is in Central Time), and so we went and did a quick trail as well as a lookout and had both places to ourselves. Overall a great park, and unlike any other national park in the USA or Canada.","March 30, 2016",One of a kind,478,"Toronto, Canada",5
Mammoth Cave,I went on a weekday and I didn't expect quite the amount of people. WOW. I just barely got on the last spot for a tour . They were booked for days. If you go make reservations on line to guarantee a spot. I was lucky. It is so worth the trip. Check the type of tour you and your group is suited for. Not everyone needs to go one the strenuous ones if your not sure call them and they will help you pick the right one. The gift shop is kind of small but has lots of things to choose from.

Mammoth Cave,"My son and I visited the park as a last second decision on his spring break. Because we decided so late the only tour available was Domes and Dripstones. We preferred the description of the Cleveland Avenue tour, but had to ""settle"". I was prepared to be disappointed, but was blown away instead. The tour was wonderful and the guides were great. (If you are ever lonely and just want to talk, make eye contact with a park ranger. They are all excited to share what they know).They warn you about claustrophobia repeatedly. It was to the point that I was a little worried. But the reality is that I did not want to leave the cave when the tour was over. The tightest spot had a ceiling of about 5 feet that lasted for about 10 feet in length, but that area was also 20 or 30 feet wide so it didn't feel tight at all.If you can, you should.We also hiked around the park going down to the River Styx (awesome name) through the woods and around to the Dixon Cave (used to be connected, but now is a separate cave). We were surrounded by foraging deer the entire time. Quite beautiful.Also make a point to drive through the park so that you take a ferry across the Green River (no bridges in the park). Ferries just don't exist anymore so it was a cool little throwback experience.","March 29, 2016",Domes and Dripstones Tour and Hiking,15,"Chicago, Illinois",5

The toughest part was the climb back up the 366 staeps at the end. Make your reservations early, they only do two tours a day and it fills up quickly. Only 30 people allowed at a time. No flash photography allowed. Take a bottle of water and don't over dress. The walking keeps you warm. I will be telling my friends and family about this very cool tour. Our Rangers were Sue & Jeff.

With that being said, the tour was awesome. The guides were fantastic. After listening to reasons why Mammoth Caves are different than other caves (i.e., Carlsbad Caverns), I reconsidered my rating. The guides explanation made me understand why we were in a special place. The only thing I wish the National Park would consider is adding a special 'photographers' tour.

Mammoth Cave,"Our family of 4 took the Domes and Dripstones tour, and we were not disappointed! Two hours of absolutely beautiful views. The tour is rated for a moderately high level of exertion; I would agree, for the most part. I am not in great physical shape, and it was just enough for me--any more and I would have been wiped out. It was well worth a little extra sweat to see the beautiful formations. Autumn, our tour guide, was GREAT. She had the best dead-pan sense of humor, which our family enjoys. She managed a small group ""ordinary families"" and a large high school group with ease. Well worthwhile, and on our must-do-again list.","March 28, 2016",Super experience,10,"Aurora, Illinois",5

She was friendly and knowledgeable about the area and was genuinely happy to share her knowledge with us. We took a short walk down to see the Styx River and up the hill around the historic trail.

For someone who had never been to any cave, it was amazing. We also did a short trail. No entrance fees, except for the cave tours. The kids did. Jr. Ranger Program(free) .

Mammoth Cave,"Went here last when I was 9, over 30 years ago. I was fascinated at that time and since have gone to many different caves. Finally went back to Mammoth and took the family, although a good tour we weren't super impressed. Domes and Dripstones was pretty but 118 people (tour max) is really too many. Park Ranger was very knowledgeable but not super exciting to listen to. Kids were pretty bored. Didn't really get too many of the grand cave openings that you usually think of. That is probably unique to that specific tour though. It was raining/sleeting while we were there, kind of thought it was odd that they stopped us for 15 plus minutes prior to going into the cave out in the open to give us some history and go over safety stuff. They should have done that back at the covered parking area prior to boarding the buses. Nice to see but there are better caves out there, and it's tough for me to say that because I am a huge national park fan. Rangers at the visitor center though who did the Jr Ranger program were amazing! Took a lot of time with the kids going over their books. Very impressed there.

We went on several hikes on the many trails, which were well marked and easy to navigate with the Mammoth Cave brochure map/guide. We also went on two cave tours, Domes and Dripstones and Cleveland Avenue. The Domes and Dripstones tour was fantastic! We learned a lot and experienced several different parts of the cave, well worth the many stairs you have to climb! The Cleveland Avenue tour was okay, but a little monotonous. You pretty much stay in a straight tube (Cleveland Avenue) that is lined with gypsum, then turn around and go back the way you came in. My only complaint would be that while we were there, the park was still on their winter schedule. There were only three cave tours available, and everything closed at 4:30.

Mammoth Cave,"I went to Mammoth Cave March 11-13 for a solo long-weekend intending to hike and do some cave tours.The trails are great - very well-maintained. The system immediately surrounding the Visitor Center managed to feel very remote, and there were some great things to see along the trails (views, points of interest). I also did some hiking in the back country after asking a ranger for a recommendation. The Big Hollow North Loop was great - not too muddy despite the recent rainfall (it's a pedestrian and bike trail - no horse poo!). Since the area isn't mountainous (hills - yes, but steep incline/rock scrambling - no), the trails are accessible for people of all activity levels. Strangely, I didn't run into a single person on the trails either day I went hiking, which surprised me because the weather was beautiful!I did two cave tours - Domes and Dripstones, and Cleveland Avenue. These tours were equally interesting/informative/fun, but couldn't have been more different! The guides were very knowledgeable, and it's clear that they're passionate about the park. Even the bus drivers to/from the cave entrances are full of great info. **Special shout out to Ranger Matt of the Cleveland Ave tour - he totally indulged my peppering of questions about the Wild Cave Tour after showing us a couple of the holes people crawl through during that tour. He spoke a lot to the geology (and also to the history, but the geology made my nerd heart tingle with happiness!) and made some great recommendations for other tours to do based on interest level in history vs. geology.The Visitor Center is very nice - very clean, helpful people, and plenty of stuff to look at while you wait (displays, shopping, etc). Clean bathrooms, an ATM, and access to water - all great things!I highly recommend the park during the off-season. The weather can be a bit sketchy depending on the time of year, and some of the tours don't operate outside of peak season, but there's plenty to do!

Mammoth Cave,"In the late fall of 2011, I traveled here for the first time with the intention of proposing. A cheap flight and a shared love of camping was all the allure I needed to spend a few nights at a small National Park. What we got was far beyond our expectations and we've been back many times since.Among the best things about the park is that it is very family friendly. Once, when visiting the park, we found a backcountry campsite with a lot of litter. I cleaned up and called the park rangers to inform them. They came out the next day to investigate. Had this happened at a park like Yellowstone, I would have left immediately as bear safety must be taken seriously. Here, there is no threat - even of black bears - so I would recommend this for your families first backcountry camping experience.The tours and tour guides through the caves are amazing. The Wild Caves tour always has waiting lists so you can buy your tickets on-line early. Do it. You wont regret it... unless you are claustrophobic. My (now) wife and I did this on the day we got engaged and it was an amazing experience. For those that have visited other National Parks, the facilities are top-notch and there are showers... for those that have not, it is a good park to learn hiking basics -- less traveled than many other parks.

Mammoth Cave,"I went to the cave on a Friday - May 29th 2015 - I didn't prebook a tour.Some people are complaining because it's not the ""nicest"" looking cave. Firstly that's purely subjective to their poorly educated idea of what a cave is ""supposed"" to look like, probably based on a cave they seen in some fiction movie or tv show.(ie Mt Everest isn't a perfect cone shaped mountain with a zigzag snow cap)What isn't subject, is the size. Namely the length. It's impossible to tour more than a fraction of it(which is still a lot) even if they did open the entire cave up. Also it still has some stereotypical cave formations, drip stones, stalacites etc - not as much as an uneducated person thinks a cave should have but still has some neat formations.Our guide(forget his name - great guide though) was informative, about the history, ownership, the first people who ventured into it etc and also about the geology. I read a few complaints about some guides being rude, but you find a percentage of rude employees everywhere, and I don't think all guides should be judged with the same brush. One part the lights were all turned off for half a minute and we all experienced %100 sheer darkness.I was happy with my 1.5 hour tour of the New Entrance. I paid roughly $20 for my tour.PS It's very hard to take pictures because the lighting is dim.

That would have been a different experience in my opinion (not as good). My son and I enjoyed the history with plenty of time to ask questions, and take pictures. My husband and other son enjoyed walking our dog on park trails before we switched so they could visit the cave. We appreciated that the park allowed dogs on the trails (not in the caves), otherwise we would not have been able to visit.

Mammoth Cave,"I had a wonderful time exploring the caves. The tour guides were informative and generally good (one was particularly good as she was a geology graduate student) although they tended to rush the crowd. I know that they have a schedule to keep but while some people just want to take pictures and move on, others, like me, do want to stop now and then and gaze at the beauty. I would suggest that when there are more than one bus for the tourists that the people truly admiring the view are given more time.We did have an experience though. We were going through the drips and domes tour and at the very end of the tour we saw the most incredible features of the entire tour, the frozen niagara falls. Many people slowed down to take in its beauty as well some of the beauty beyond it. We were near the back of the tour (but not the last), when suddenly the lights in front of us got turned OFF! My wife started yelling and was getting scared. I was lucky that I saw the light box near me (the lights behind me were still on) so I fumbled and was able to turn on the lights in front of us back on. We then started running and yelling. When we reached the outside, both tour guides were outside the door and were about to lock up. We were just so startled over what had happened that we boarded then bus and then realized that there were most probably other people behind us. When we got off the bus, I first asked the tour guide if he did head counts. he said, NO, it was the responsibility of the tourists to keep up. I then told the guide that there were most probably others left behind and locked in the cave. His eyes got big and then ran off to a ranger jeep and drove off. We are uncertain how many others were left behind. However, besides our little adventure, I would HIGHLY recommend MCNP to all, it is a jewel of the national park system.","January 24, 2016","A must visit National Park, but keep up with the guides or else!!",41,"New York City, New York",5

It's nice and cool in the cave, perfectly comfortable if you're wearing jeans and a long-sleeve shirt, but bring a pull-over or zip-up hoody if you're the kind that gets chilly easily. There were a few steep hills to climb, but nothing this out-of-shape 30-something and my 10-year old son had any trouble with.

For someone who is NOT a spelunker, the caves are an amazing sight and experience. However, since tour groups are SO large (I've gone during spring break and during the summer), it makes it slightly less enjoyable. Even though using flashlights, flash with cameras, and blocking people to take pictures was discouraged at the beginning of the tours, people still did all of these things. One one tour, a little boy flashed his flashlight at everything, including in people's eyes, until my friend asked the mom to take his flashlight away. Unfortunately, this isn't an isolated incident.

The park was snowy and lovely with deer and wild turkey as we entered the park by car. Upon arrival, the most noticeable difference was the emptiness of the parking area. I took one of the closest parking spots after arriving about 30 minutes prior to our tour. The gift shop was also empty, but staffed by two helpful staff members. Our cave tour required just one bus to transport our group to the cave entrance. Our ranger / guide informed me that 4 bus loads of hikers is not uncommon during the Spring and Summer. The cave tour was uncrowded, there was plenty of time for questions and stopping to take (non-flash) pictures. The cave maintains a consistent temperature regardless of season so there is no disadvantage to Winter touring. In addition to the park being more lightly attended, the hotel where we stayed in Cave City was nearly empty and offered a promotional price for advance reservations.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave is one the country's most beautiful national parks. It certainly contrasts the scenery of the western parks (Zion, Grand Canyon, Yellowstone, etc) and is a great place if you love the wooded outdoors. There are a variety of cave tours for all ages and family-friendly. Furthermore, there are over 70 miles of hiking trails that wind through different parts of the park's dramatic hollows and Green River valley. You could easily spend a week doing different activities here. There are more activities (tours, river recreation, etc) offered in the summertime. However, wintertime is a great time to take a cave tour because the temperature remains constant in the cave passageways (54 F) and tour groups are smaller and more personable. It is crucial to check the park's website and make reservations ahead of time, especially on the weekends and in the summer. People are stunned when they drive hundreds of miles on a holiday weekend and all of the cave tours are sold out. Please make sure to plan ahead and get the most out of your visit!","December 22, 2015",A southern Kentucky masterpiece,5,"Nashville, Tennessee",5

Mammoth Cave,"We thoroughly enjoyed our day at Mammoth Park. We started with a Saturday evening campfire ranger talk. The night's topic was caving. It was interesting, educational and even humorous. You could tell that the ranger lived and breathed caving and his enthusiasm was contagious. The next day we drove back to the park and took the Domes and Dripstones Tour. There were a lot of stairs, but we, including the three year old, managed quite well. There are at least two stops on the tour where people are allowed to sit on benches in the cave. Our ranger tour guide was also knowledgeable and helped make it fun for the kids. The best and most beautiful part of the tour was at the end when we got to see the Frozen Niagara part of the cave.After a picnic lunch we started off on the Heritage Trail, linked into the Old Guides Trail and took the Sinkhole Trail down the mountain. We hiked back up to the visitor's center via the Historic Entrance Trail. The leaves were changing which made the scenery gorgeous. The ranger stationed at the Historic Entrance Trail was kind enough to let us go down to the trailhead and take a photo of the historic entrance to the cave.We ended our day with a scenic drive along Joppa Ridge Road, which is one way starting near the Green River Ferry and Mammoth Cave Campground. Once again the foliage was stunning.

Mammoth Cave,"We joined two tours, domes & dripstones and Cleveland ave. The tour guides were great, but the tours themselves can be better. For domes & dripstones, it was very interesting in the beginning, but after like first 15 minutes, it started to get boring, instead of exploring the caves (which was expected), we were forced to sit and listen to stories. Stories are great but I prefer exploring actual caves.There was less stories in second tour, but the cave looked the same after a few turns. The final destination (snowball room) was less impressive because of human activity (it used to be a dining hall and you can see the effects of smokes on the cave wall).

Mammoth Cave,"(Reviewer=30 year old male with wife and 1 year-old baby boy.)Our family had a beautiful weekend for not much $$ at Mammoth Cave.Mammoth Cave is the largest known system of caves in the world. The 400 miles (so far) of explored, mapped, and surveyed cave continues to unfold new mysteries every year.In the cave 149 species of creature live or visit — including human beings. The others include eyeless fish, crawfish, small cave bats, and camelback cave crickets. The bats are not venomous or dangerous — full grown they are not much larger than a mouse. We saw several sleeping peacefully as we walked right by them. The cave crickets are a bit creepy but also harmless. The cave is mostly limestone with a sandstone roof. The Green River coming in from the Northwest breaks through cracks in the hardened and insoluble sandstone to cut rivulets in the soluble limestone underground before joining again with the Green River at the southeast end. The water over many years cuts paths in the stone before breaking down another level and cutting a new path. Over many, many years this has lead to the labyrinthine Mammoth Cave. The shape of the cave is not a straight line, but more like a network or web of jagged lines, criss-crossing, cutting back and looping around. The caves were evidently explored by Native Americans more than 4,000 years ago, and were “discovered” again as part of the New World in the 1800s. Settlers owned portions of the ground above the cave and eventually discovered the “historic entrance,” a giant cave aperture appearing in the ground. Shortly thereafter, owners began offering a tour of the cave for a small fee. A group of owners began consolidating the property in the late 1800s and early 1900s. They wanted to make a National Park so they began buying land from farmers. Mammoth Cave became a national park in 1941. The earliest and most famous American explorer was tour guide and slave Stephen Bishop. Bishop. Bishop went deeper into the cave than anyone before him. By discovering and naming some of the caves that to date are the most majestic, most awe-inspiring, most dangerous, he built an international reputation for himself during his day and remains a notable man today. Through the tips he earned as a tour guide, he eventually saved up enough money after he was freed to buy his wife and children back. He is buried in Mammoth Park. This is easily the largest cave system in the world. And more corridors are being “discovered” and mapped each year. Planning a trip for a day or weekend? While there are some free tours, most of the most interesting tours cost between $5-15 dollars, with the longest one being $24. So bring food, hiking shoes, a sweatshirt (the caves are a steady 55 degrees) and enough money to go on two or three cave exploration hikes, and enjoy the time of your life.","November 20, 2015","Cool cave, definitely deep",9,"Fullerton, California",5

Mammoth Cave,"As I walked through the cave with the tour. It was a really slow pace and he would stop to talk about the different people who have been to the caves and alittle oversight on the history and who owned the caves through history (to be honest I didn't really care, I was more interested in how the cave was created through nature) it was a 1.45 hour tour. Prob could have done it in about 30 mins if he wouldn't have stopped us so much to talk about who was written on the walls. For that 3 mile walk there, it was the same formations, until we got to ""snow ball"" which was alright to see. But then he tells us we have to go back the same way..... So again walk all the way back going the same route. There are so many passage ways i was pretty upset we had to go all the way back the same way.... I wouldn't go back and heard from plenty of other people on the tour they have seen way better caves in which were more exciting. I would say this cave and the tours are for old people who can't really adventure in to a cave and cannot walk up more then an easy 200 steps.

They were both great and very informative tours and very different from one another. There really are a ton of stairs but don't let that stop you unless you have health concerns. The tour guides were very knowledgable and we will come back again some day to try the Wild Cave tour. They offer less tours in the winter so next time we come we will come at a different season.

By the end my knees hurt, elbows bruised, mind blown, and totally loved every minute of it. My husband wasn't sure with the restriction on chest size if he would fit through the tight crawls, but he did just fine.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave National Park is a wonderful place to visit anytime of the year. We have been several times and decided to participate in the Domes and Dripstones tour on this most recent occasion. in my opinion, the tour size was too large to be able to get much information from the tour guides but overall the tour was very good. This tour is more of an underground hike than the typical cave tour so wear appropriate shoes and be ready for a lot of stairs as this tour does require a fair amount of effort. that being said my daughters, 4 and 6, were able to hike the entire tour without needing to be carried.The best part of the tour if you are interested in the typical cave formations is the last quarter of the tour which is covered by the shorter and less physically demanding Niagara tour offered by the park.

Mammoth Cave,"This is basically a review of the cave tour. The national park is quite beautiful in itself as we were passing through in the fall.We did the Domes and Dripstones tour. Since it was off-season, I thought it wouldn't be so busy, but then some 48 people came and joined the group and we were on a sold out tour. I think the price is very reasonable to see some cool cave-related stuff. The tour guides were incredibly nice and extremely helpful. Some of the formations on this tour are absolutely breath-taking. The main issue I had overall was the size of the tour group. We were in the first 15 and still barely received any information. I can't imagine what it was like to be person number 98. Due to this, we also had to move through rather quickly, it felt very impersonal.The good news is that we have been on some other cave tours, which were smaller and the information is pretty much exactly the same. Which means if you have been on a different cave tour, I doubt you are missing out on much.I would recommend the tour, but I wouldn't go again.","November 1, 2015","Mammoth Cave Tour: Good, but I've had better.",4,"Brisbane, Australia",3
Mammoth Cave,"I have wanted to do this trip forever. Even though I have been to Mammoth Caves a couple of times before, my kids weren't old enough to participate in the wild cave tour. I am so glad that I looked at the Trip Advisor reviews before I went! It really helped me prepare for the experience-besides making me very nervous. When it was all said and done, at the end of 6 1/2 hours, we had an exhilirating experience. Some advice: My friend and I were able to do this as reasonably fit 50 year olds. So as long as you meet the width requirements, you should be able to do this as long as you like caves and don't have claustrophobia. You will be crawling (squiggling really) through a 9 inch high section. Some parts were pretty aerobic, there was a longish section that involved crawling the whole time and the pace is quick, it is not travel at your leisure. You are tasked with keeping up with the person in front of you while keeping an eye out for the person behind you. The only lights are on your helmet and if you are alone, it gets dark quick. It is not all crawling though, parts of this tour involve canyoneering-holding on to both sides of a canyon some distance above the ground. The skill here is to maintain three points of contact so that you don't fall (the guides will explain and demonstrate this to you)I have several suggestions that will help make your trip more comfortable: padding! Due to the bat disease, you will be wearing NPS provided coveralls and pads and gloves. None of your clothes can extend beyond this besides your boots. They are not kidding about the boots needing deep tread and being over your ankles. They do check, our group passed.Since I had knee surgery, I took the protection of my knees seriously . I bought and wore thin knee pads with a hex design (purchase at Dick's Sporting goods) under my coveralls-I was wearing exercise capris. Since they give you their own knee pads, you really can't do thick knee pads or theirs won't fit. I also used similar protection pads on my elbows -I was wearing a t shirt. These saved me from a lot of the bruising I read about in other reviews. Their knee pads, are in varying condition and had the tendency to slip. I felt well protected and had no elbow scrapes or bruises. If you want to bring a camera, it is very dark and your hands are busy. You can bring it, but it might be more useful to have a go pro, which we didn't have. Someone in our group had a cell phone and did get a couple of great pictures.It is important to be on time. We were a group of 10 instead of 12 because some people were not on time. The guides are supportive, informative, but clearly are not going to baby you. Don't go on this trip expecting them to bring you through it. It is a great experience to see what spelunking is like, to see what it is like in a lightly used section of the caverns and to have fun. Even though you see some interesting domes and pits, it is not the stalagmites and cave formations that you see on the other tours. So if you want to see those, please add another tour to this one. There is an option to opt out of the tour about 1/3 of the way in, no one took it. Also, there is a bypass for the 9 inch portion of the cave, 3 people took that. It was tempting, but I am so glad that I chose the challenge. Everyone was happy they took the trip, with the right expectations and preparations, you will have a great time.","October 31, 2015",Wild Cave Tour- My dream come true,42,"Blauvelt, NY",5

Mammoth Cave,"We very much enjoyed the visit, both to the Mammoth Cave National Park and to the Mammoth Cave. The park center was well maintained, attractive, and those working there were friendly and helpful. The rangers helped our children get started on a Junior Ranger badge project. The ranger who conducted a guided tour/hike was quite knowledgeable, both of the park and the history of the park, and conducted a friendly educational tour. The visit to the Mammoth Cave was a bit more challenging, as our toddler does not yet walk. We ended up using a wrap to take him down into the Mammoth Cave. The rangers and other members of the tour group were helpful and understanding when sometimes it took a slight bit longer to make a descent or climb with him strapped to us. The tour was very informative and the cave itself quite interesting. Having been in several caves in past years, this was the most unique and challenging tour yet. It is designed, though, so a person can rest when they need it most while presentations are being given during the tour. It was the first time in a cave for our children.

The only negative that I would have, and it's not for the park or tour itself, is that parents really need to think about taking their children on this tour. There were some young kids, between 3 and 4 years old, that got antsy and cranky about halfway through. It's not their fault, they are kids and want to run, but this isn't the place for it. And this made the remainder of the tour a bit more of a challenge as we try to maneuver around and listen to the guide while listening to kids crying.

They were spaced far enough apart to be private, even though there was only one other couple in the area that day. I've rated this the Best Picnic Spot of the Trip - see my pics.","October 24, 2015",Best Picnic Spot of the Trip,60,"Tulsa, Oklahoma",5
Mammoth Cave,"This tour is only available in September and October. It lasts a little over two hours. Our tour guide/park ranger Michael was excellent--shared so much interesting information! It is limited to about 35 people, so book in advance (online). There is no electricity in this cave, so most participants (not children) will carry a kerosene lantern. They provide plenty of light.

Mammoth Cave,"This was our first time in a cave. We did the domes and dripstones tour. Take exit 53 (off 65) to avoid the ferry- seems like a faster route maybe but I can't compare bc it's the only route we took! The tour was excellent and very interesting. I will say that this particular tour had a lot of steps and walking (they have easier tours). I, personally, had no problems, but I am 31 and in good health. There was an overweight woman and she was breathing very heavily, but she made it! There was also an older couple, late 60s/early 70s?, and they seemed to do okay too. But if you get short of breath after walking I do not recommend this tour. There are several (4-5) stops where you sit on a bench and listen-so it's like a built in rest! Overall I would definitely recommend this as something to do! ","October 22, 2015",Neat!,9,"Houston, TX",5

We had a good experience, but next time will do the more restricted tours where there are less people and age restrictions - it was hard to hear the Ranger at times which was a bummer, he had a lot of great commentary!

Mammoth Cave,"We LOVED our trip to Mammoth Cave,let's say that first. Our complaint was the large group of 114 people which 2/3 were children under 6 for the Domes and Dripstone tour. The tour is going over 2 hours long which is not enjoyable with 1 speaking tour guide you can not hear while babies cry and children play due to boredom. We understand the park was crowded but it's unfair and unenjoyable to cram that many people especially with young ones on one tour. It makes it miserable. I enjoy going into the caves and being educated which you can't do when you can't hear and spend most of time waiting for the parents to regroup children that are too young to even be doing this type of tour. Please,in the future,consider maybe during busy time like Fall break,adult only times or perhaps charge more and do a smaller group option. Just some suggestions to make it more enjoyable for all visitors. We did enjoy the knowledgeable rangers on the lantern tour. Although busy,it was not as large of a group and way more enjoyable.","October 20, 2015",Groups too large with too many small bored children,15,EVERYWHERE,3

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth cave national park is a beautiful park. We did the domes and dripstones tour. On this tour, we learned a lot about the geology of the cave, but not much history. There are a lot of stairs going down, and some pretty tight spaces. I would not recommend this tour for someone who is larger or not in decent shape. However, my kids did fine on this tour including my 5 year old. We also hiked the turnhole bend trail on the south side of the park. It was an easy 0.6 miles and was very pretty. We passed several sinkholes and learned about those along the trail as well. The park wasn't crowded at all, but I have a feeling the fall is a lot less busy for them than summertime.","October 20, 2015",Mammoth Cave national park,38,,5

Mammoth Cave,"We had 8 in our party. We drove from Louisville and it was about 1 hour and 20 minutes. The visitor center is very organized and we were taken on our tour at exactly the time we booked for. Many of the tours book up, so reserve in advance. We booked the ""Domes and Dripstones"" 2 hour tour. The underground cavern is spacious, but at 6ft 2,and 246lbs, I had to crouch 30% of the time. Much taller and it wouldn't be comfortable. The man made metal steps numbered 525,although steep, are down, not up. Getting back up was much easier than anticipated. The entire tour takes 2 hours and is well worth a visit. Temperature in October was 57 degrees in the caves,so a shirt and sweater were adequate after walking a bit. I would say, no one had ANY difficulty,so don't hesitate.Remember, going down was much steeper than getting back up. The 2 park rangers were knowledgeable,and looked out for all on the tour. There is no wildlife.A bat or 2, and some frogs and crickets.Otherwise, a sterile environment.

They are very firm on their departure time of tours. We were 3 minutes late to one and totally missed it. Then we almost did the same thing the following day, but they have them frequently enough, it isn't hard to burn a hour waiting on the next one.

PS: After, we went to the Green River Ferry area on Green River Road. It's just a parking lot; but look for the Echo Trail. It's about a mile long max and there is a big natural spring and a huge creek area that I kids LOVED, maybe even more than the cave.

Mammoth Cave,"We took the 10 AM ""Domes and Dripstones"" tour, which lasts around 2 hours. Though it only covers less than a mile in distance, it feels much longer due to the hundreds of steps on the route. Our group was quite large, and the rangers kept us moving on the trail, but there was time to stop and take a photo en route (no flash photography allowed). There are two stops along the way at benches, kind of like mini-amphitheaters in the caverns, where the ranger talks about the history and geology with the entire group. Some of the passages are quite narrow, some very low-roofed, and some very damp. The route goes through a series of domes (lots of stairs and catwalks), then through dry caverns with many rock fall areas, then into the stalagmite/stalactite areas. The dry caverns are less interesting visually; the title/mite areas are lovely. Our ranger guide was excellent; he had a great sense of humor, was very knowledgeable, and, with the exception of the safety briefing, none of it felt or sounded ""canned"" or rote. After the tour (or before), be sure to check out the nicely done exhibit in the visitors center that covers every aspect of the cave, from the human history, to exploration and mapping of the cave, geology, and the flora and fauna.

Which is amazing that you can walk 4 miles underground and not repeat anything, but there wasn't anything amazing to see until the very end where there were stalactites and stalagmites. With that being said my inner geological nerd loved it!! My fiancé thought it was ok. My biggest complaint about the tour is that there were 78 people in our group. By the time you got to the next meeting place the front guide had already explained or pointed out things and we never got to hear much of what he was saying. There was a guide in the back but she never said anything, just turned out the lights and made sure we didn't leave anyone behind.","October 12, 2015","Nice, but....",10,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",3

We traversed approx. 600 stairs, as a matter of fact, and that was during the 2-hour tour (as opposed to the 4-hour tour). This cave is not for very obese people as you literally turn sideways & squeeze between cave walls more than once. That said, the views were magnificent, the caverns enormous. You get to see 3 different types of caves all in one visit, which was very interesting. Our guide was extremely knowledgeable and took time to answer all of our questions.

Mammoth Cave,"I went to Mammoth Cave as a child and loved it, I went as a teenager and loved it, and now I have been as an adult and I still love it. There are tons of great tours that you can take, trails to hike and they have greatly improved the visitors center with a small museum on the history of Mammoth Cave (which is very vast and interesting). We did the most strenuous and longest of the cave tours which is the Grand Avenue. It is 4 hours and about 4 miles worth of up and down hiking in the cave. We had a great time and loved seeing so much of the longest system of caves in the world. Our guide and the park ranger who were leading the tour were very nice and informative. We really enjoyed ourselves. The Grand Avenue tour encompasses The Frozen Niagara route, Domes and Dripstones route (except for the near 280 stairs at the entrance through the vertical shafts), and the Snowball. There are about 700 stairs (with an optional 100 more at the end to see Frozen Niagra) and numerous steep hill climbs switch back style on this tour. I would love to go back and do some of the shorter tours. Mammoth Cave is somewhere any one of any age can go and enjoy themselves.

Mammoth Cave,"First tour was the Onyx Lantern Tour. It was spectacular. Carrying a Coleman lamp, we descended with Rangers Chris and Chris for an informative tour with lots to see. I really had little expectation for formations, yet there were plenty. Apparently, this ""used to be"" considered an easy tour. This year they changed it to moderate. It clearly was difficult for some in our group. They offer a bench halfway through. Make sure you wear appropriate shoes with tread. Some were wearing sandals. Sorry people, this is a cave. The Frozen Niagra Tour is absolutely easy with plenty to see, as well. Not sure why Mammoth gets a bad rap when it comes to formations; there are plenty, just not the crystals that we have seen out west. Between tours we decided to walk the Cedar Sink Trail. Unfortunately, it was not well marked and we were concerned that we would get lost. Because of work being done on the Heritage Trail, we couldn't access it.Loved the area.

Ranger Kevin was our guide. He was very knowledgeable about the geology and history of this unique geological phenomenon. Recommend a camera, carry a small flashlight - lighting is good throughout the cave, but, in some areas, we wished we had additional light. Wear comfortable walking shoes or hiking boots. The walking path is smooth but you will descend / and ascend steep hills and extensive stair cases. 4 Miles in 4 hours doesn't seem like a lot, but consider the up and down terrain - this is why its rated: strenuous.

Mammoth Cave,"The Cave is said to be the longest cave in the world; it may be but as the video said the width of the cave system is about 7 miles wide; I had thought that when we were in eastern Kentucky that the cave system extended that far east and west to past the Mississippi River. But the 405 miles of caves much be somewhat intertwined. We took the Drips and Domes tour; much of the tour was walking down stairs and visiting small areas. Much of the cave we saw was a dry cave area which meant that there was little in the way of stalags (mites and tites) and very little ""bacon"". The last part of the tour did display drip formations which we have seen at many other cave systems. I would think that other cave tours would display more of the cave formations one would associate with cave tours.There are also some interesting hikes and the small ferry over the Green River is worth the effort.

Read the tour descriptions very carefully and pay attention to the ratings, In general the tours are very good but I felt rushed in that we had to stay on the fairly tight schedule which took away from the enjoyment. Most cave rooms were barren with formations located in the wet area of the caves.

Mammoth Cave,"This is one of those places I have always heard about, and could not resist stopping while driving from Nashville to Indianapolis. It was a nice side trip. It is right off I-65, and I was able to get on a ""Domes and Dripstones"" tour leaving only 10 minutes after I arrived. I was here during their ""shoulder season"" so crowds were light, and my tour was only 45 people (rather than the normal 120). The tour was 2 hours, just under a mile of walking a straight course through several areas of the cave. You have to descend A LOT of really steep steps at the beginning, in order to reach ""level 3"" of the cave. That part is not for the weak of heart. From there it was a relatively smooth and easy walk (ascending most of the way, gradually in most places but somewhat steeply in one or two). I was not in the ""historical section"" (closed the day I was there), so did not see the ""famous"" parts. The parts I saw were a cave, a really big one, but a cave. No stalagmites or stalagtites until the very end of the tour, but it was interesting to hear about the geography of the area and of the cave itself. I hope to stop back in one day to see the historical section.

I am sure there are other tours that give you a better view of the formations that we were hoping for in this tour, but if that is what you are looking for it is at the very end of this tour and there isn't much.

Mammoth Caves wasn't really on our radar but it is a ""must do!"" in our opinions!We arrived at the beautiful visitor's center the day before planning to tour the caves. You can't enter the caves without booking a tour. All tours are reasonably priced (between $15 and $55) and there are choices for all fitness/interest levels. Most of the shorter tours don't sell out in September but we were hoping for the 4 hour Grand Avenue Tour ($24) which is only offered once per week. Luck was with us as there were 2 cancellations that day and we got in.Rangers and volunteers were on hand to answer questions and the gift shop employees were friendly and helpful.Our tour began with a short bus ride to one of the man made entrances where steps led into the darkness. Electric lights are turned on at the front of the group and turned off again by the ranger in the rear. This particular tour has a capacity of 78 people.Our rangers were excellent! They made the trip fun and interesting and were able to answer questions easily. There are almost 700 stairs on this tour, 3 large hills to climb, and some narrow passages to squeeze through. The temps are a steady 54 degrees F, so long sleeves are a good idea if you chill easily. The trail is hard packed dirt which can get slippery at times, shoes with good tread are recommended. Some tricky areas have handrails to help you keep your footing. There were 2 bathroom stops which also had water fountains. Bottled water is the only food/beverage allowed into the caves, and flash photography is not permitted.Learning the geology of the cave formations and the history behind it becoming a National Park was fascinating. We plan to return and tour the cave with our 11 year old son.One thing to note - the trails in this park don't get the attention they deserve!

Mammoth Cave,"Directions from visitors' center to park trails weren't well marked and some park employees were ""at the end of their season"", uninterested in being helpful. Fortunately Cecily at ticket sales and Kelsie at info booth did a nice job of improving our impression. We took the River Styx and Green River trails, the latter the better of the two. Our cave tour started with 250 steps down - tour guide gave interesting history, but only Frozen Niagara at the end was eye-popping; apparently we're not cave people. Green River Ferry was interesting way to get to Maple Springs Loop. ","September 19, 2015","Park so-so, Domes and Dripstones fair tour with good ending",40,"Columbia, Missouri",3
Mammoth Cave,"Loved Mammoth Cave, due to so many factors! The size becomes apparent bit by bit, as you walk down a ton of stairs, then your group is dwarfed by the entrance, and the seeming non-endingness enchants you to no end. The tour was guided by a man I referred to as the ""Willy Wonka of Cave Tour Guides""! He was funny and droll, and had a never-ending (as well) supply of good stories about the scintillating history of Mammoth Cave. Lots of good ghost stories, which were made more real by all the lanterns (no electric light) and my hearing a rock or something thrown...from inside the cave beyond the end of the group, where no one was! Loved it and can't wait to return.","September 18, 2015",Spooky and Spectacular Star Chamber Tour! :-),38,Anonymous,5

Mammoth Cave,"We did the 4 mile tour. It is described on TripAdvisor as strenuous & the park ranger(s) warn you ahead of time what to expect. I am 53 yrs old, in average health (I walk, bike, etc...but no strenuous cardio). I was physically able to do the tour, however I WAS tired at the end & very ready to be out of cave. I would have liked a tour that was 2-3 miles long (vs. the 4 mile option). I think the 1 mile/1 hour would be too short. Our park rangers/guides were Tom & Shannon. Tom was our main guide (head of group) & did a fantastic job. Shannon took up the rear & made sure we all made it out safely, as well as answering any questions we had about the park/cave. Nicely done! Hydrate before walk (bathrooms are available).

Mammoth Cave,"First, let me say, I have germ issues, cleanliness issues, just general issues in this regard...so WHY would I. Choose to stay at a National Park? I was wondering the same thing as we drove up, I gave a sideway glance to the ""cabins"", and I was underwhelmed. However the front desk staff obliged me in that she gave me a pre rental tour to allay my fears about bugs etc.... It was all good. VERY CLEAN and Comfortable, private bathroom in the cabin with ample hot water and clean linens. the bed was nothing to write home about, but it was clean and comfortable. the TV was not in service, but we fell asleep to the locusts humming. The cabin also had a small fridge, and a coffe maker, although we ate at the onsite restRaunt which was TERRIFIC, the oatmeal for breakfast option with a side of eggs sustained us through a day of hiking and stairs climbing in the cave. Overall, I'm more of a canyon type traveler, but the Mamoth Cave was beyond expectations, and I was pleasantly surprised . the price of the cabin was super reasonable when compared to the on site lodge which had no hot water. I can live without TV Hot showers are kind of mandatory .We did the Drips And Domes tour, the natl park service ranger was friendly and informative, the cave was outstanding and impressive . I would definitely go back.","September 15, 2015",Skeptical at first....but a GREAT stay,14,"Gainesville, Florida",5

Mammoth Cave,"The caves have not been modernised to the extent of destroying their history, only to make them safely accessible, which is great.We did 2 tours, the first being an evening one, by lantern - absolutely brilliant idea asone could get a small sense of what it would have been like to explore them without modern electric bulbs.Cameras are allowed as long as the strobe/flash is disabled, but quite honestly, I don't believe pictures are needed.You need to walk through the caves, feel the changing temperatures, view the different geology and actually experience sitting in the total darkness.Multiple caves so you cna make it a short visit or a day or more as well as many walking tracks.We stayed in the park - cost $20 for a site and I think we paid $3 for a shower token (10 minutes). Loved it and want to return for longer. I believe that each time one goes you can have new experiences and the guides are incredibly knowledgable.","September 14, 2015",Another walk back in time,42,New Zealand,5
Mammoth Cave,"I am finally getting time to review our trip to Mammoth Caves. What a spectacular National Park. We did some exploring of the cave in multiple ways during our 2-3 days we were in the area. We obviously walked down to the caves to explore the inside in just the general tour guiding ourselves. We were there on a weekday and it was fairly crowded. We also did the Intro to Caving tour. Here is where the fun begins! Please note, you will get dirty, and will have to wear coveralls! And proper shoes are required. They will check and they will not let you on the tour if you have incorrect shoes. The tour was awesome and well worth the money. You will not be disappointed. You are bussed to a different entrance where you descend down some pretty narrow stairs to the bottom of the cave. Imagine doing this without stairs…like they did when it was first discovered. From here, the tour continues through the cave to see some great sights. One of the favorites of the tour is turning off all lights. Literally can’t see your hand in front of your face. The tour continues as you do some climbing. Not for the faint of heart if you have little experience, but great tour to gain the experience needed for the more difficult Wild Caves tour. Towards the end you will squeeze out on your stomach through a very narrow hole, so be prepared for that. From there, it’s up and out and back to the disinfection stations. I highly recommend this tour! Next time we return, I would not hesitate to do it again or the more difficult 6 hour tour.","September 14, 2015",Into To Caving Tour- Mammoth Caves,91,"Columbus, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"We visited Mammoth Cave in September 2015, and took the Historic Tour, which is an approximately 2 hour, 2 mile tour through a very small portion of this amazing site. Our ranger was amazing, and has a personal connection to the cave. During hot weather the cave is very cool and comfortable, which made it a nice break from the heat. The Historic tour does go through some small and tight spaces, so if you are super tall, have knee or other flexibility problems, this may not be the tour for you. But, if you can do it I highly recommend it - you get a view of some of the iconic locations within the cave, a taste of how ""cozy"" caving can be, a huge dose of history, and an great experience in the end. The light level is low, so I recommend using a night photography app on your phone, or bring a camera that can handle low-light situations if you want to take pictures. Outside of the cave there are some things you can see with short to moderate hikes, and there looked to be some nice hiking/biking trails in the area as well. You can stay at the hotel on-site, or it is within about a 30 minute drive from Bowling Green, KY.","September 14, 2015",Amazing Experience,31,"Boulder, Colorado",5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave National Park, located in central Kentucky and encompassing portions of Mammoth Cave, is the longest cave system known in the world with more than 400 miles explored. Its vast chambers and complex labyrinths have earned its name - Mammoth. It is awesome and unbelievable. You can only see the cave on a tour with the park ranger who gives orientation talks in the visitor center, and describes each part of the Violet Lantern tour entrapping you with the information. Wear sturdy shoes or hiking boots. No sandals or bare feet. A light jacket is recommended, cave temperatures range from freezing to around 600F (15.50C). In winter, dress warmly. Prehistoric explorers quarried gypsum and other minerals from cave walls by hammering it with rocks or scraping it off with mussel shells. Although their reasons for valuing the minerals are unknown, possible uses include trade, medicine, preservatives or cultural ceremonies. Paleo-Indians, the early settlers, gather cane reeds to use them for lighting their way through the cave. Several reeds about three feet in length were bundled together, providing light for approximately one hour. The Cave Hotel offers hotel rooms and a restaurant all year.

Word to the wise--if you are doing Wild Cave or Intro to Caving GET OVER THE ANKLE BOOTS WITH GOOD TREAD. Trust me, you will need them. But I would 100% recommend one of the caving tours.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave was the first collection of caves that i have visited that were mostly ""dry"" caves and not ""wet"". Primarily that means that you won't see the rock formations that you will find in caves like Luray Caverns. All in all, it was a pretty spectacular trip. We took the historic tour, that was very interesting and gives you a good introduction to these caves. The main draw back and reason I gave it three stars is that this tour is apparently the most popular, with ~ 100 people in the tour groups (especially in peak season). The size of the tour means it can be quite uncomfortable, and it was less pleasurable for me. If they would reduce the groups to around 30-50 or so, I think that would be best. But the caves are till worth it a trip. Safe travels!","September 9, 2015",Awesome,118,"Takoma Park, Maryland",3

The tour is not for the faint of heart, as we descended nearly 300 feet in 17 vertical shafts. We all enjoyed it - the cave was 54 degrees (95 and humid outside) and our tour guide was very entertaining and knowledgeable. Our 9 yr old enjoyed the exploring aspect - as you couldn't see much in front of you and didn't know what was around the next bend.

Mammoth Cave,"This was our fist visit to Mammoth Cave National Park. We consider ourselves extremely lucky to have as our tour-guide, Mr. Jerry Bransford, a descendant of Mat and Nick Bransford who, as slaves in the 1800's, were forced to lead exploration tours into the dark caves. Jerry's knowledge of the caves and personal connection to the history resulted in an unforgettable tour for my husband and me. We chose the ""Historical Tour"" and would recommend it for any able-bodied individual. You need to be able to walk while bent over and to squeeze through tight places, although most of the tour you will be walking upright in wide-open areas. I'd highly recommend wearing hiking boots or at least sneakers. For those who are prone to motion sickness, as I am, you should be aware that, due to the darkness and/or changes in elevation, you may experience some dizziness and slight feelings of nausea, although it passes quickly once you get into an area where there is more light.","September 7, 2015",Fascinating Historical Tour,15,"Columbus, Ohio",5

Mammoth Cave,"We recently were on a RV trip when we decided to stop at Mammoth Caves National Park. We thought that the caves would be a good way to break up our travels for a day. However, after we got there we found out that there is a lot more to do at the park than just go on a cave tour. We found out that along with cave tours they also offer surface hikes, canoeing, horseback riding, bicycling, camping and more.The most notable surprise was that the camping sites they offer can satisfy everyone. They offer almost every type of camp site from back country (primitive) to RV sites with asphalt pads. It should be noted that the RV sites do not have hookups. They do have a dump station and fresh water fill up station that you can use while at the park so the only real draw back is the lack of electrical hook up. Although, you can run your generator from 7am to 10 pm. If camping is not for you, they also have a very nice hotel with a cafe/restaurant or within a short drive from the park you can choose from several other hotels.This is one of those parks that you will want to visit for more than a quick weekend and may even want to go back to on an annual basis.If you want more information about Mammoth Cave National Park you can go to.... http://www.nps.gov/maca/index.htm","September 1, 2015",More To Do Than Just See The Caves!,73,"Hartland, Wisconsin",4

The give the kids a badge and certificate after getting so many bat points after doing a certain amount of activities to do on an activity book they give the children. They also provide multiple group activities for the children throughout the day to take part in as well.We went on the historic tour, the ranger that led the tour was very knowledgable and when asked for questions, picked our 6 year old to ask question. She told the ranger she did not have a question, but was a Jr. Ranger. The ranger had acknowledged and thanked her for becoming a Jr. Ranger and the proceeded to inform the rest of the tour about the Jr. Ranger program.That was very cool, and impressive that they really encourage the young people to get involved with the park. The Visitor Center has a Heritage museum inside, telling the history of Mammoth Cave. It is very well done and has alot to do for adults and for children.

Mammoth Cave,"The only difficult thing about visiting Mammoth is choosing which tour to take. With such a vast cave system and a myriad of tours available, there are so many good choices that I would consider staying at the on-site hotel and spending 2 or 3 days here next time I visit. Read through the parks web site and pick your 2-3 favorite choices before you arrive. Some tour time slots get sold out and you might want to go to your second choice rather than waiting for the next tour.The feel of the Mammoth experience is very different from Carlsbad. There's something about Mammoth that makes it more of a ""cave experience"" vs. Carlsbad which has alwasy been more of a ""tourist attraction"" to me.

It's not Carlsbad, and because of geological conditions lacks most of the beautiful stalagmites, stalactites, columns, draperies, etc. that we're used to seeing in ""western caves."" Mammoth has some large rooms and some interesting trails, but the most interesting part of our tours was the rangers' discussion of Mammoth's role in U.S. history, and the history of Mammoth itself. Access to the cave is via guided tours, and depending on the ""season"" when you visit, your access will be limited.

We didn't book early enough (a couple days before leaving on our trip) and were unable to get into some of the more active/longer tours. That being said, Domes and Dripstones was a great tour and comes highly recommended.There are hiking trails available, but be aware, they seem to be more of a means-to-an-end to get to the back country camp sites. They're nice walking trails if you like woodsy scenery, but know that there aren't many sweeping vistas or amazing views.One negative - horseflies.

I enjoyed this tour because it covered about 2 miles with just the beginning/end overlapping, so you get to see a good amount of the cave. I also enjoyed hearing about the history and how it came to be a national park today. When the man who turning it into a tourist attraction put a gate up and charged admission, people thought he was crazy to think that people would pay money for a tour of the caves. Some of the other tours looked interesting and I would have considered them if I was in the area for longer.","August 25, 2015",Interesting Cave System,55,New England,5
Mammoth Cave,"We did the historic tour and did the domes and domes and dripstones tour later with about an hour and half between tours for lunch which we brought. It was nice to have the two separate tours as we had kids ages 11, 9, 7 and they appreciated the break. Do the historic first if possible as the dripstones was a nice way to end the day.

Mammoth Cave,"We had my 61 year old father as well as my young sons, 3 and 7, plus my 8 month old infant. We decided to take the domes and dripstones tour although it was rated ""moderate"". The park rangers in the welcome center were very helpful in in assisting us with making the right decision as they offer a multitude of tours. The kids loved the fact that the tour started with a ride on a school bus to the cave entrance. Going down into the cave was the best part! But be warned, if you are above average size this particular tour may not be a good choice for you as there are some very tight spaces. That being said, the rest of the tour was entertaining and the guide was very informative but not overly boring. There were some nice formations towards the end of the just under two hour tour. Would love to go back and check out some of the other tours. ","August 25, 2015",Fun for the whole family,5,,4

Mammoth Cave,My husband and I went on two tours; the lantern tour in the evening of 8/9 and the historic tour during the mornig of 8/10.

Mammoth Cave,We had a great time. Fun place for family if you would like to bring the younger ones. We did a couple thing this time around and went on the 4 hour tour. Got to see lots but there was a lot of walking and up and down slopes. I got amazing pictures and it was something I've never done before. Cool down in the caves but the guide was great and full of information. Bringing the kids next time just not the 4 hours tour until they get older. Make sure to make reservations as it can book up early.,"August 23, 2015","A Must, Beauty underground",15,"Manton, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"We visit the Mammoth cave for a weekend and visited two tours: The Domes and Dripstones tour and the Star Chamber tour. Both tours were fantastic and the Ranges did good Job entertaining us - and giving good Information. Both tours complement each other.The Star Chamber Tour is very great, since you work through the cave only with lanterns and the electric lights are turned of - so you can get a feeling how people in the past may have seen the cave.Tip for all visitors: The Cave can be very cold, even if it is hot outside. If you go in in hotpants and a short top, you will probably freeze :) . ","August 23, 2015",Great experience,1,,5
Mammoth Cave,"Was in Mammoth Cave mid Aug and it was great. Rangers at the front were not very friendly but can't imagine them saying the same thing 1000 times a day. Visitor centre is very new and has great exhibits and a good movieI had reserved the Violet Lantern Tour about 2 weeks prior to date of arrival. You cannot wait til you get there to do so esp in summer months. There is only 1 tour a day at 2:30. Remember that this tour is for the experience of walking in the dark with a lantern. You are not going to see much of the cave as you have little lighting unlike the rest of the popular tours. For the price you, do see much more and it also includes some the more common parts of other tours (at the beginning) I've been to Luary and Penns caves so I didn't really care for the wet type caves which are not that spectacular here anyway. Mammoth cave are mainly dry caves and where it stands out is the expansiveness of it.... all 400 miles of it. The tour took us thru 3 miles of it or 3 hrs (no washrooms so don't drink too much beforehand) and it was very informative and bit creepy. Just watch ""the Descent"" movie before and you'll think blind goblins may come out from the dark from all corner. They did in fact find prehistoric mummies there and lots of artifacts. This tour was rated strenuous but it was just normal walking for my family (2 girls 11 and 14) but then they are use to climbing in Utah/Arizona and the Alps. Ranger was very informative thru out the tour and you can use him like a personal guide if you walk in the front. The experience is better too as you look forward into total darkness. We wanted to book introduction to caving and do some crawling but the website said you had to all have ankle height hiking boots. Oh well next time. Note: shorts and a fleece or rain jacket is all you need.As for the rest of Mammoth Cave NP. We did a quick trail - Heritage Trail to kill time before the tour. Nice easy walk on a boardwalk near the lodge and you also get to see the cemetery where a few slaves were buried. Watch out for the wild turkeys and deer in the park.The cafeteria/restaurant in the lodge is reasonable and not too bad. The BBQ sandwich is good for $6.95 with fries or +$1 for amazing onion rings. If you have kids ensure they do the Jr Ranger program to earn a nice NP badge. My kids are junkies and have 25 badges to their name each. It's educational and fun to collect and earn. Just grab a book and have them fill it in. We stayed in Cave city while visiting Mammoth. It's fairly close. Sleep Inn is the best there. As for food The Mexican El xxxx is really good and cheap beer at $1.50 a mug. Cracker Barrel is a second close. Not much choice. There are some souvenir shops along the way to the caves but nothing exciting except rocks... Did manage add to my collection of licence plates there.If you are interested in sink holes .... go check out the Corvette museum in Bowling Greens as this it what cause them to lose lots of nice cars in 2014 incident.If you have any questions, let me know.","August 23, 2015",take the Violet Lantern Tour,340,"Toronto, Canada",5

The Frozen Niagara Tour is a must, which was the only tour we booked for all five of us, and our nine-year-old loved the Trog Tour. Other than those tours, we did several hikes, and spent lots of time just enjoying the grounds, and the very nice visitor center.

Mammoth Cave,Our family thoroughly enjoyed our cave tour of Drips and Domes today. Thay was the tighest squeezes we have been through on any of our cave tours to date. Narrow steps straight down a very nice stair system. Dry most of the way until near the end when we got to Frozen Niagra. What a gorgrous display of flow.

Mammoth Cave,Mammoth Caves are beautiful. We did the Historical Tour and enjoyed the journey thru the caves and our Ranger. There are several tours and if you have time do more than one.

Mammoth Cave,"My wife & I went for the caves; if you like caves you need to go, and do at least 2 of the various tours (watch for overlaps, but it may not matter as so much of the tour is the guide). We stayed on the lodge onsite which was OK, but overpriced for the quality of accommodation/facilities like most things nearby. It was worth staying on site though, as gorgeous woodland around, we had some lovely walks, we did early and had cave tours in the afternoon, worked well as did get hot..... The actual visitor centre is pretty good, but you mainly go there to book & meet for the tours. This is out 5th or 6th National Park,and the ranger led tours have always been excellent, Mammoth Caves is no exception, and indeed, made our 2nd tour as less interesting rock formation wise. The Gothic Avenue gets a mention as been fascinating on the 2nd tour though. Visit their website for more info and the tours, you can get (very) casual though to real potholing/caving, great place.","August 21, 2015","Brilliant Cave Tours, rest not so good....",29,"Banbury, United Kingdom",4

The displays and history were very good, at the beginning they have a 3-d model showing the caves that they have found and how they connect, it is truly amazing to see just how many there are and at different depths and then try to imagine what is underground still waiting to be discovered. Hopefully we can get back to do the tour.","August 21, 2015",Ran out of time sadly for a tour.,76,"Mission Viejo, California",4

Mammoth Cave,"Last weekend we visited Mammoth Cave with our two children, ages 8 and 10. We had reserved two tours for Sunday, but drove over to the park to check it out on Saturday afternoon.We drove down from the north and had to use the Green River Ferry. We weren't sure what to expect, but it couldn't have been easier. The ferry runs constantly from 9am to 9:55 pm. It holds 3 cars at a time and the ride takes 5 minutes or less. There is one operator and passengers stay in their vehicles.We went directly to the Visitor's Center and headed for the Information Desk in the center of the building. The Park Rangers there gave our kids a couple of workbooks and told them that they would receive Jr Ranger pins if they completed a certain number of the activities. Our kids are not yet too cool for that sort of thing, but I was surprised how excited they were. The book contained about 30 pages of educational activities, each one different. A few required extra equipment (like the timer on my phone) or that you walk to a nearby cemetery to answer some questions. All the pages centered around either caves, Mammoth Cave or the National Park Service. The number of activities required to earn Jr Ranger status was determined by the child's age. My kids loved the books so much they did way more than was necessary - my son finished the whole thing! I had expected the Rangers to flip through the books to check that enough pages were completed, but they actually looked at each page and commented on any activity that had required some creativity by the child. Our kids were thrilled and wore their Jr Ranges badges with pride for the rest of the day.The first tour we took was the Historic Tour. It seems that they will allow as many as 75 people on this tour. We entered the cave through the ""historic"" entrance, which looks like you would expect a cave entrance to look. This portion of the cave is dry, so there aren't really any interesting formations to see, but there is plenty of cave history and lots of cool anecdotes. The tour lasted about 2 hours and consisted mainly of walking through the cave with occasional stops for information from the guide. It was clear that the Park Service's main goal is protection of these natural phenomena, with education and promotion as secondary. Less able-bodied, exceptionally tall and more rotund cave enthusiasts may want to consider other tours. This one contains a fairly long very narrow stretch, followed immediately by a fair distance of very low ceiling, and ends with 155 steps up to get out of the cave. Ask at the information desk for specifics to help in making your decision. At the end of all their cave tours, Mammoth Cave requires visitors to walk over a spongy mat loaded with Woolite in an effort to prevent the spread of White Nose disease, which has decimated about 80% of their bat population. Overall, the Historic Tour was a great introduction to Mammoth Cave.We took a break for lunch and ate at the Travertine Cafe in the Mammoth Cave Hotel, a few steps from the Visitor's Center. Both the food and the service were adequate at best.In the afternoon we took the Domes and Drips Tour. This tour entered through the ""New"" entrance, which was a steel door in a hillside that we reached via 10-minute bus ride. This tour began with about 300 steps down, so also may be inappropriate for visitors with walking or knee issues. Also a 2-hour tour with mostly walking and occasional comments from the guide, this portion of the cave was part dry and part wet. Toward the end of the tour there were some spectacular formations to marvel at. We thoroughly enjoyed this tour, despite being pretty tired by that point in the day.We will definitely go back to Mammoth Cave. We would like to take one or more of the lantern lit tours. These tours are smaller and were all sold out by the time we were making reservations the Thursday before our trip.Our whole family would highly recommend a visit to Mammoth Cave. In the 1 1/2 days we were there, we weren't able to do as much as we would have liked. It would definitely warrant 2-3 days.","August 20, 2015",Cool Cave Fun for the Whole Family,5,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5

My oldest (girl) was captivated by the beauty and the science behind it, while my two younger kids (boys) enjoyed the challenge and physicality of the hike.

There are a few ""official"" stops on each one where the group will gather and they'll explain some stuff, but you learn so much more about the cave if you are near the ranger the entire time as he'll point out interesting stuff as you go along. Make sure to get to the box office early or book the tours ahead of time as they do sell out quickly (especially on weekends)The above ground trails are ok to look at, but not as interesting as the caves are.","August 16, 2015",Interesting Cave Tours,87,"Indianapolis, Indiana",4

The only times we were able to get close to the guide to hear what he was saying were at the 3 different pit stops in the larger areas of the caves. Those parts were interesting and we learned a bit about the history of the caves, but the rest of the time we were just walking quickly through the caves.

Mammoth Cave,"We visited Mammoth Cave, KY for 3 days/2 nights as a get away trip for my boyfriends birthday. It turns out that he has been wanting to visit since he was 10 yrs old. So 34 yrs later he finally made it!We lodged with Hickory Cabins. It was a perfect 1 bdrm secluded cabin in the woods right at the end of the national forest. It had all the modern amenities of home, full kitchen, grill, nice bathroom, internet, cable, fire pit and a wonderful deck out back overlooking the woods. We had several animal friends at the cabin, a black snake who sunned himself on the deck and a nice size turtle whom my boyfriend tried to turtle-nap for home...something else he's always wanted.Getting to the caves was a very easy 15 min ride across the Green River on the 3 car ferry and thru the forest. I loved it. I even saw a river otter which I named Ollie. Riding through the forest was beautiful. So many wild turkeys along the road and deer of course.At the caves we did 2 tours lasting about 2hrs each. I can't remember names though. It was so amazing to learn that these caverns exist below us and the wonderful history that goes along with them. Be sure to take a jacket as its chilly below. I recommend buying tickets online ahead of time as tours sell out quickly. Nothing worse than getting there only to find you can't do the tour. Luckily we scouted the place out the day before so we'd know what to expect. We packed a lunch to eat between the tours since the onsite restaurant didn't appear, or smell to be to our liking.Getting to town from where we stayed wasn't so bad. If you wanted chain restaurants it was about a 30 min ride north or south on I-65.All in all we had a wonderful, relaxing time.

Mammoth Cave,"I have driven through Kentucky a dozen times and never stopped so I decided to visit Mammoth Cave this time. I spent the night at a hotel in Cave City which was about 30 minutes or so drive from the caves the next morning. There are scheduled tours throughout the day of various caves. I just saw the main cave as I was getting back to my road trip that afternoon and did not plan to stay all day. My tour lasted about an hour or two which was enough though there was plenty more to see that I missed. A large group of about 50 or so people were on my tour. You cannot go solo and need a guide inside the caves, though I did notice some nature trails in the area outside that anyone could walk around. It was worth the stop and I highly recommend a visit if in the area.","August 12, 2015",A great stop on a road trip,115,"Palm Bay, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"We took the Grand Avenue Tour and the Historic Tour. The Grand Avenue Tour is 4 miles long and takes 4 hours. The narration was excellent. If you want to take some of these once a day trips I strongly suggest you make an advance reservation. We got to the Visitor Center at 8:00 am and this one was already sold out. Being a hiker, I did not think this tour was terribly strenuous, but it was beautiful. However, if you want to see some of the best of the cave and don't want to spend 4 hours doing it, go with the Historic Tour. It is 2 hours and is a lot of fun. Once again, expertly narrated. Be advise it is 54 degrees in the cave year 'round. We stayed in the campground which was very nice. The only complaint I have about it is there are no showers so you have to go to the camp store and pay $3.00 for a 10 minute shower in a rather crummy shower stall. I thought that was a bit much. But other than that, the campground and the overall experience is top shelf.","August 12, 2015",Lives up to it's reputation as a geologic wonder,28,"Lago Vista, Texas",5

Once we arrived the last cave tour was sold out; however, once we spoke one of the many park rangers on staff, we decided to book at tour for the next day and spend the night at a local hotel. The cave itself was amazing. We took the historic tour and if you decide to take that tour be prepared for a lot, I mean a lot of stairs. The tour also includes ""Fat Man's Misery"", ""Short Man's Misery"" and "" the Bottomless Pit. I would not recommend this tour for anyone who is not some what in shape or has ANY trouble with stairs, bending or walking on many different terrains. The parks department has done a great job providing really nice walk ways where they can, but hey, its a cave and it is what it is... We did not see any bats and I was glad. I highly recommend touring Mammoth Cave, we will go back soon for another tour. The Mammoth Cave hotel was sold out... it was the weekend before school started so they were very busy. Hopefully when we go back we can stay at the hotel and give their restaurant on site a try.","August 12, 2015",Being Spontaneous,13,"New Albany, Indiana",4
Mammoth Cave,"We took the Historic Cave Tour, which was unlike any other cave visit we've made in that it really was about the history of the Mammoth Caves and the Ranger guide helped bring that history alive. The spaces inside the cave are spectacular and beautifully lit, but don't expect stalactites and stalagmites; this is a dry cave. The historic tour itself is describes as ""moderate"", which I have found the USNPS use in various ways. What they mean here is 450 steps in total over 2 miles. That's about 250 feet down and 250 feet back up. The pace is very slow and on the long set off tops out of the lowest point, there are plenty of places to stop. The pace nearest the front is actually the slowest as the Ranger sets the pace that way.","August 12, 2015",Great tour. Book ahead,684,"Huntingdon, United Kingdom",5
Mammoth Cave,"We took the Domes & Dripstones (geology-focused) tour in the late morning, and loved it so much that we signed up for the Historic tour that same afternoon! We were there mid-week in very early June, which is likely why there were still openings for the second tour. Guides were very knowledgeable, humorous, and open for all kinds of questions - we didn't have a single question that they couldn't answer.","August 11, 2015",Worth an Encore,13,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",5
Mammoth Cave,We only made a day trip of this and the entire family decided they want to go back and stay for a few days there is so much to explore and do. Not just the many cave tours but trails and camping and probably much more we didn't get to see. We took my 63 year old mother and our 3 boys ages 7 through 11 on the historic mammoth cave tour. Quite a bit of walking but well worth the trip the frozen Niagara was beautiful.,"August 11, 2015",Kentucky vacations,3,"Lawton, Oklahoma",5
Mammoth Cave,"My boyfriend and I camped here for 5 nights. When we arrived Thursday night, the Visitor's center was just closing, so we didn't get to speak to someone about tickets for upcoming tours. We got up early the next day and we were some of the first people inside. We were dismayed to find out that almost all of the tours for the ENTIRE WEEKEND were already booked. (This was Friday morning at 8 am). We were sorely disappointed at first but decided to change our plans so we could do one tour that morning and then two others on Monday. While I was hugely disappointed at first, the experience really turned out well. Our campsite was nice and the facilities were great. My only campground complaint is that they don't do much to enforce the rules for quiet hours (10 pm to 6 am - voices down and all rb generators/engines/etc should be off - this was not enforced) and for pet control (dogs need to be leashed or on cables, this was not enforced and we had a couple of small dogs running around, scaring wildlife, and barking at all hours).That being said - the park is lovely. Be prepared for brutal humidity, but it is still an amazingly impressive place.Our tours:Domes and Dripstones: This showcases areas of the cave that are still ""living"" and lots of formations. It was a very brisk pace, and there are narrow portions of the path, so keep that in mind. We had Richard and Bobby as our guides, and they were wonderful!Gothic Avenue - This takes you through level one of the cave and the oldest portions of the cave that have been found as of yet. It features a lot of the candle smoke ceiling signatures and some great formations. We had Sue and Joe as guides, and they were very knowledgeable and informative.Star Chamber - This tour is in the evening and is really special. It is one of their lamp lit tours. Terry and Alicia guided us through the historic entrance of the cave, to the Star Chamber, and up in to part of Gothic Avenue (yes there is some overlap with the Gothic Avenue tour, but it was worth seeing again!)Overall we learned a lot and enjoyed the experience. My only main items to perhaps ask for improvement with would be enforcing rules in the campground to keep things safe and to hold people accountable (such as be respectful of others or please vacate your site!), and then perhaps to offer the more popular and lengthy tours more than once a day to accommodate more guests. A couple of the tours are offered many times each day, but a lot of them are only once, and they do book up these special tours far in advance from what we heard. We will be back again another time! Looking forward to it!","August 11, 2015","Great experience, could use a few tweaks!",6,,4
Mammoth Cave,"This is our second visit to the caves as we wanted our kids to learn about the caves. Couldn't get tickets for Grand Avenue tour even though we looked for a couple of weeks before. Went on Domes and Dripstones tour and Historic Tour. Loved them both. Kids (13 & 9) also enjoyed the tours. We also went to the camp fire lecture on bats and bats were flying on top of our heads and it was pretty cool (and we learnt some new things about bats). We also went hiking on the various trails and loved it - especially in the morning: it was foggy above, water was reflecting the trees. Green river trail is really pretty. Turkey was walking by us, it didn't care and wasn't scared!! When we went to River Styx, my 9 year exclaimed, oh, it's real, I thought it's only in the mythological books!","August 11, 2015",Educational!!,95,Indiana,5
Mammoth Cave,"Spent a full day there - but I wish I would have spent 3. We did the ""historic tour"" and the ""domes and drip"" tour. We enjoyed the historic tour more because we were within 10 people from the front of the line where the ranger was. He had a nice running commentary and was pointing things out along the way. On the Domes tour, we were almost at he end of the large group and if we hadn't been with a friend who had done the tour a couple of times, we would have missed a lot. They do stop both tours about 4 times each and the Rangers spoke - but with such large groups it was sometimes hard to hear. I wish they would add signs along the way pointing things out (formations, different geology, height to the top or bottom). I also wish they would offer more tours with less people (maybe no more the 50) so they could give everyone the same tour.

Mammoth Cave,"On a recent road trip through Kentucky and Tennessee we decided to stop and experience the magnificent caves we were told defined that region. This was our families first time caving the the experience did not disappoint. We arrived a little later than we intended but there were still tickets left for the tour we wanted. I understand this is not always the case so if you have a set time in mind I suggest booking in advance, especially on weekends and holidays. We visited on a Monday so perhaps that was why there were tickets available. As this was our first time caving we decided to book the Historic Tour, 2 miles / 2 hours. It does get cold so bring a jacket or sweater. Our tour guide was fantastic. Knowledgeable with a great personality for sharing the stories of the cave. Despite the large group and the enclosed space there was room for everyone to hear the stories and history of the cave and there is a guide at the front and one at the back with lanterns; non-one is left behind. The on-line description of the tour was accurate in terms of difficulty level so use caution if you are unable to negotiate stairs and tight spaces. I'm somewhat claustrophobic and no issue with this tour.Well worth the visit and the price paid.","August 9, 2015",First Time Cavers and Mammoth Historic Tour did not disappoint!,21,"Toronto, Canada",5

Mammoth Cave,"We drove 2 1/2 hours out of our way back from vacation to see the cave. We were really excited to see the formations....however we were VERY disappointed when we got there and all tours were sold out for the day. The only way to see anything at all was to pay a minimal fee for the ""self-guided"" tour. Don't have high expectations if you don't go on one of the actual tours. We probably only spent 20 min in the cave and weren't allowed to go into most areas because we weren't on any of the ""real"" tours. MAKE SURE YOU MAKE A RESERVATION! I can't stress this enough! I think we would have had a blast if we could have actually seen more of it.","August 9, 2015",Beware - tours sellout fast & self- guided tour isn't worth it,4,,2
Mammoth Cave,"We like caves and we generally check them out if we are traveling near one. Mammoth certainly does not disappoint! There were a variety of tours to select from...so we went with one that seemed rather unusual: a tour solely by lantern light. The group was rather large, about 35 total, but it was really cool. Three miles through different parts of the cave than some of the regular tours. One in four people carried oil lanterns so we could see the way. Tour guides were excellent, illuminating the occasional interesting feature from paleo art to cataracts and answering a great variety of questions about everything from geology to ghosts. I found the online description to be accurate--there was some steep climbing along the way. Although it was in the 80s that day, the cave remains at a constant of 54 degrees so maybe remember a sweater and some sturdy shoes. Seemed like reservations were key during tourist season -- many tours were sold out when we arrived. If you have a few extra minutes before your tour, the exhibition at the visitor center was worthwhile.","August 8, 2015",Violet City Tour,45,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",5
Mammoth Cave,"Highly recommend booking a tour in advance as spots fill up pretty fast. Otherwise, you may not get the tour you want the day you arrive. A group of us booked the Intro to Caving Tour after reading all the tour descriptions. Since only a few of my friends had never been in a cave before, this 3 hour tour was a great choice. Would definitely recommend that you have a good solid pair of tall hiking boots (ankles covered) with good soles. Inside the caves is 54 degrees year round, however since you will be wearing their coveralls, you don't have to bundle up underneath. I had just a t-shirt and shorts and I was very comfortable. The tour was filled with lots of crawling, few climbing areas, squeezing through some small and tight spaces. Next time we return we will be doing the Wild cave tour.","August 8, 2015",Spelunking..

Mammoth Cave,"We went on the ""historic tour"" which didn't really have as much history as I hope for. The cave was pretty cool. It had wide open cathedral-style spaces, and skinny hip hugging spaces. The tour group probably has about 50 people in it, and therefore wasn't very personal. However it was a cool experience. Try to plan for multiple tours. The campgrounds are also nice.","August 7, 2015",worth the visit,9,"Troy, Ohio",4

Mammoth Cave,"My family visited this national park on the spur of the moment and all had a great time. But I hope to just write about some errors that we made so you can avoid them. We went at the end of July and it was extremely hot out and dressed according to the weather and not the caves. The average temp in the caves is 50 degrees so bring a hoodie. Most of us had on hiking sandals, but 2 of my daughters had flip flops, I would suggest something with a not slip or a tennis shoe. My 6 year old slipped and hit her knew, causing her dad and I to carry her for a bit. Know your limits. If you have little ones that are afraid of the dark, these tours might not be for you. We took the Historic Tour which was about 2 hours long and at one point they turn everything off. They do not allow camera's with flash so turn them off beforehand. The caves are not accessible for wheelchairs. Take advantage of the reservations so you can get the tour you want. The easier ones sell out quick.

For the most part the side trails were also nice but some where a bit sketchy. There were some downed trees that made it hard to get around them becuase there were a lot of ledges and valleys. Trails were long with no shortcuts which made for a long day of riding, but I wanted to see everything so I did the long ones too. I stayed at Mammoth Cave Horse park, the camp ground was very nice and had great bathrooms and sites. Horse stalls where required and they were kinda far from camp. Atleast 500 to 600 feet.

Mammoth Cave,"For anyone who has caved before, I do not recommend this tour. The cave itself is a decent sight, although it's hardly anything special. At the beginning of the tour we got bussed 30 seconds down the road to the changing station. The coveralls were the only gear that seemed in decent condition, although some had holes in them. The knee pads were irritating (itchy, pinchy) but performed their task (albeit sliding down the legs of everyone on the tour.) Half of the gloves were riddled with holes, and some tour members didn't even get to wear gloves because there was far more left gloves than right ones. Climbing the cave without gloves/gloves with holes will guarantee at least a rash. In the actual cave, the guides scolded everyone for not ""communicating"" even though everyone was in earshot of them and they were watching the person in front of them perform easily accomplishable climbs. The scenery of the cave was decent, but mostly rocks and dirt, with few formations. The only scenically pleasant area was at the very end where we passed by another waking tour and were rushed through the area with little chance to enjoy the view. After riding the bus back, we had to clean our gear, and the guides disappeared out of sight. (So much for disinfecting, they didn't even clean their gear) I think this trip would be decent if the guides weren't so controlling and passive-aggressive, and only if you've never been caving before.","August 5, 2015",Intro to Caving; Decent Cave Ruined by Guides,4,,2

Mammoth Cave,"I've always heard great things about Mammoth Cave and it's been on my to-do list for a while. Unfortunately it was one of the most disappointing experiences of my life.Our family has been caving before and we were expecting Mammoth to be the biggest and baddest. How wrong we were.Our guides were a male, Cory, and a middle-aged female whose name I forgot.The guides were cranky and enforced absurd rules constantly throughout the tour. We had a group of sixteen people and the guides could easily talk to them all at once, but instead they choose to quietly talk to the people nearest them and tell them to pass the information on back to everyone else. Everyone ultimately was kept in the loop but the guides still scolded us at nearly every stop for lacking proper communication, ironically enough.They also made the insignificantly small climbs much more complicated than they needed to be, and if you didn't follow exactly what they tell you to do they scold you for it. At one point there was a three-foot drop onto solid ground and they were having people climb down backward. I and a few others simply chose to hop down because it's far easier and safer, and they chewed us out for it and made passive-aggressive remarks toward myself and a few others throughout the rest of the tour, while praising everyone else for displaying good behavior.Most of the tour was crawling on hands and knees or walking through tight spaces, and when there were climbs they sucked all the fun out of it by making you look like a fool.Even the bus driver was cranky and short with people.Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that it's primarily run by state rangers rather than naturalists or specialists that are more passionate about caving.Absolutely would not recommend to anyone with any prior caving, hiking, or climbing experience. It might be alright for a first caving trip, but otherwise I'm afraid it's a huge disappointment.","August 4, 2015","Intro to Caving Tour: Huge Disappointment, Terrible Guides",3,,2

Mammoth Cave,"The WORST-managed cave tour system I've ever seen in a cave: they're clearly scheduling too many different tours, too closely together in the cave. I will never go back to this cave again.My friend and I went on the ""Frozen Niagara"" tour, and the tour group we were in was told several times to stand to the side and wait for larger groups to pass by: they were scheduling so many tours that the groups were constantly running into each other. And we were told that (since we were the smaller group) the other (larger) groups had to be given priority. We probably spent a third of our time in the cave waiting for other ""higher priority"" tour groups to pass by.We even had to rush ahead several hundred yards (going up and down a bunch of stairs) to make room for another group to pass by. Then they expected us to go BACK that same distance and route for us to be told about the things we'd just been herded past.","August 3, 2015",Lousy scheduling & tour management,4,"Lexington, Kentucky",1
Mammoth Cave,"I saw Mammoth Cave decades ago, although no one else in my group had been there before. My concerns about it perhaps being repetitious were quickly put to rest. The addition of the newer Visitor's Center with its historical displays was a great way to begin the visit.  We had looked online beforehand, and saw that they offered a bunch of different tour options, graded in difficulty from Easy to Very Strenuous, based in part on the number of stairs/elevation changes, as well as conditions encountered (ie, if you're crawling through tight spaces, or only using lantern light). Some are offered to adults only, some to children only, and many are designed for families, although there are some with age/size restrictions. Several specialty tours are only offered once/day, and they tend to be those with smaller limits on the number of people who can participate. Tour prices vary.We opted to first take the Gothic Avenue Tour, which left at 8:30 am, and entered through the original Historic entrance to the cave. It was limited to 40 people, and gave ample opportunity for us to hear and ask questions, as we trekked past many portions of the cave that were open in the early years (mid-1800's). We saw lots of examples of candle-smoke signatures and stone monuments left by those early visitors. The total tour time was about 2 hours.After taking a break ""above ground"" to see more of the Visitor's Center exhibits, we went on our second tour of the day, the ""Domes and Dripstones"" Tour. It's offered at many different times during the day, and had over 100 people. Although it didn't say there was any age limit for this, it's considered ""Moderate Difficulty"" and there were a number of steep steps/narrow passageways to navigate It was clearly a challenge for some people who had small children to carry them through, and besides the times when some would cry, it was tougher to hear the guides when so many people were spread out so far. Still, it was a good complement to our earlier tour, as this one had begun after a short bus ride to the New Entrance to the cave, and the formations were significantly different that what we saw earlier. The Frozen Niagara was quite impressive, although people are not allowed to use flash photography on this tour, and my pictures didn't turn out very well. (There is a separate specialty Focus on the Frozen Niagara Photo Tour, which we didn't take, that would allow flash cameras and tripod use.) In any case, it was still a memorable visit!","August 2, 2015",Book in advance to do some of the less crowded tours,57,"near Chicago, IL",5
Mammoth Cave,"We did the domes and dripstones with the the family and had a good time. Let's get some things straight:1. If you are overweight or very tall, you won't fit so don't go.2. If you have bad knees, back, trouble with exertion, don't go.3. If your kids cry incessantly, don't go4. If you take a million pictures and don't care about holding up a tour group, don't go.5. Get directions before you leave, the signs marking the park are ridiculously bad, the ubiquitous vendors w/ gaudy signs (which make it look like Myrtle Beach - blech!) compete with the official version and it is hard to figure out the right way.6. Once you get into the cave, there are no bathrooms or water. If its a long tour, that could be an issue for kids so plan ahead.Now that's out of the way. The tour we went on was a ""family friendly"" version, but it really wasn't. LOTS of stairs with rock outcroppings that sometimes required contortions (I carried a frightened 3-yr-old much of the way), slippery surfaces, steep inclines, dim lighting make it quite a journey. The pace is slow and really need to hang on to the handrails, but worth the outstanding scenery - rock formations, plunging blackness, soaring ceilings, stalactites. WOW!If you are really interested, I would suggest skipping the ""easy"" or moderate rated tours and go right to the harder stuff if your kids are older, they're smaller groups and won't have as many wailing kids and out-of-shape stragglers.

There is a lot of steps, but that was the only hard part of the tour, which wasn't that bad. Our tour guides were Shannon and Jacob. Shannon was the leader of the group and did all the talking while Jacob stayed behind and turned the lights off behind us. Jacob is a sneaky individual. He seemed to disappear at times and show up right behind us since we were the back of the group. They have a very good sense of humor and makes the tour even better.

We did the historical tour, and I learnt a lot. There were two guides, one doing the main talk and another making sure no one got left behind.

The park rangers and bus drivers were great and were right on schedule. The tour lasted about 2 hours including bus ride. We had our 7 year old son with us. The tour starts out with about 300 steps going down. The steps are narrow, and a little hard to manage. In some parts of the tour have parts of the cave you have to squeeze through, some parts that are wet and slippery, and some places you have to duck. We saw some older folks who were struggling to make it through the tour. It is rated as moderate difficulty and I think that is pretty accurate. We really enjoyed the tour, especially the end!","July 30, 2015",Domes and Drips Tour,40,"Independence, Kentucky",5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth is an apt word to describe these caves. Definitely take one of the tours, and make sure you reserve it online so you can be sure you get what you want, the tours sell out frequently.

Mammoth Cave,"I have visited a few National Parks and have not been disappointed. Mammoth Cave is amazing. It currently has 405 miles of cave. It was 400 miles the week before we visited. If you don't know how that is possible, you will just have to visit! We did two of the Ranger led tours, the Historic Tour and the Domes and Dripstones Tour. Both were very good and both lasted about 2 hours. Reserve your tours in advance; they will fill up. We also did the Ranger-led Heritage Trail. The ""surface"" tours are free. The Visitor's Center is only a few years old and was very nice. There are many hiking trails above ground that can be explored.","July 29, 2015",Never disappointed by the National Park Service,51,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5
Mammoth Cave,"This cave is amazing. There is so much to see and the tours sell out quickly! I would recommend allowing time to speak to one of the guides of your tour, like Mike. These folks are more than willing to share their knowledge of the cave history or specifics about formations or any other piece of cave information you may think of. I plan on returning for a lantern tour.....a historic tour.....Nancy","July 29, 2015",Caver Mike,6,,5
Mammoth Cave,"As others have said, you must reserve a tour before you arrive. We tried to do that several days before we came, and we were not successful. We did take the self-guided tour of a small part of the cave and found that most interesting and worthwhile. We recommend it. The walk into/out of the cave is rather steep. There are some benches on the walkway where people can rest if needed.","July 29, 2015",Wonderful stop,92,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5
Mammoth Cave,"I'm a big fan of National Parks and this does not disappoint. Always take advantage of the ranger-led hikes and programs--they have so much information to share! We did a few of the ""surface"" hikes on our own and they were beautiful. There are lots of butterflies and deer and turkeys to see! The cave itself is amazing in its greatness. The Dripstones & Domes tour probably gives you the best photo ops!","July 29, 2015",One of America's finest treasures,74,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5
Mammoth Cave,"We didn't plan enough to experience the best of this cave system. We should have arrived much earlier and reserved ahead our tour, if that is possible. Some tours were sold out, some had left out already. We were stuck with only one possibility due to our schedule. We wore keen sandals, not a great idea. The steps can be slippery. Gym shoes, backpack with water and sweatshirt are the way to go. No snacks are allowed, leave them at the car. THERE ARE NO BATHROOMS in the caves. Be prepared for that before the bus arrives, no one told us until just before. This isn't for anyone really out of shape, the steps are narrow, and many of them. They stop a few times (Domes and drips tour) and there's time for others to catch up. But I was nervous for those with small toddlers, I can't imagine holding them going up and down those narrow, slippery stairs. We loved this one of a kind tour, having nothing to compare it to, we really enjoyed the tour. It took at least two hours, including bus time. You have to wash the bottom of your shoes (literally walking through dishsoapy foam) which was fine with us. This is to protect bats from disease. We ate at a restaurant in the cave shop area...food was ok. My mom told me about an area that used to be in the caves where they used to serve box lunches, they no longer do that. Plan to eat before your trek or after. The are inside has some neat information and a short film that is nice to go thru while waiting for your tour. Wish the stores had some silver charms for our bracelets.","July 29, 2015","Amazing Experience, plan before going!",21,"Westland, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"Wanting to do something a bit different, this would be it. Spectacular views outside and inside the 400 miles of Caves in Mammoth Cave National Park. Come prepared as it's 52 degrees inside the cave. In the summer, it's cold in there. In the winter, it's warmer in there as it's 30 degrees warmer than ""outside"". Bring a low light camera to take your ""Huck Finn"" pictures inside the cave, while taking a tour from the national park ranger. The basic 1 hour and 15 minute tour (Mammoth Passage Tour) is enough…pick a different tour if you want to see Stalagmites hanging from the ceiling. Just a really neat thing to do and very affordable (only $7). Make sure you plan as tickets can sell out, especially for the more extensive tours that cost more. Smart thing to get your tickets ahead of time rather than once you're there, to guarantee getting a ticket. Nice thing to do in a day where you go to Bowling Green or the National Corvette Museum.","July 29, 2015","Very cool experience while pretending to be ""Huck Finn""! :)",25,"Winter Springs, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,An absolute must do! We had a fantastic time. Our kids really enjoyed the cave. The restaurant was fairly priced too. The cave is always at 52 degrees in the summer. The wife and kids may want to have a light sweatshirt. ,"July 29, 2015",Amazing!!,34,"Utica, Michigan",5

Mammoth Cave,"We last visited this immense cave system about 27 years ago with our young children. All these years later, we visited with our young granddaughter who is the age her mother was on our first visit. This place has not lost its ability to awe in all these years and the rangers are superb. We took the 2 hour Gothic tour which is a walk from the Visitor Center down a steep paved walkway to the huge natural entrance into the cave. If this is your first visit, make this natural entrance your first view of the cave system, whether or not you have booked a tour. It is a great first sight of the cave. As for tours, I highly recommend you get online and read about all that is offered, then take the time to reserve and pay for what you want in advance. Yes, you have to plan your visit to the area in advance but you won't be sorry. We booked 3 tours online and quickly picked up all our week's tour tickets on arrival. Advance reservations or not, arrive early as there can be a little driving around to find a parking spot as the day goes on. For those with RVs, there is a section of the lot with long parking spots designated for RVs. But I suggest you arrive early in the day as cars take up these spaces when the rest of the lot gets full, unfortunately. There also may be a lengthy queue to wait in to pick up or buy tickets, though the rangers are very efficient and try to move folks through quickly. We also saw many tours fully booked and closed early in the day. Booking in advance will avoid disappointment at not being able to get on the tour you want.The rangers who guide are well trained, very entertaining folks who appear to love their work. They work hard to keep you safe, happy and satisfied. The Visitor Center is modern and well run. The Center tries to be green. For example, there are no paper towels in the bathrooms. One really cool amenity is outside the bathrooms next to the water fountain. There is a unit set up to fill water bottles. You place an empty bottle under it and the sensor fills it with water. It was new to me and much appreciated. This friendly, awesome place is a special natural gem in the National Park system and worth a visit.","July 28, 2015",Good to plan in advance,133,,5
Mammoth Cave,"We were told to reserve our tour spot by other family prior to going, so glad we did! Once we got there all the tours were booked. Highly recommend reserving before hand. The visitor center was well done. The park was pretty (loads of butterflies). There is a hotel there that looked unimpressive- but that was just at first glance; we did not stay there so that is just a first hand impression. The place was crowded! We had booked the historic tour. That being said I found the cave tour to be just ok- I have been in far more impressive caves. The entrance is one of the most beautiful spots. The cave temperature was a relief to the high humidity and hot temperatures. The cave IS mammoth. The history of the cave was minimal. The walking was so fast that you felt uncomfortable with the large crowd and the fast pace to keep up to stop and enjoy what unique spots there are. I was hoping to see some cave life (cave crickets or something) but there was nothing.I would like to venture back to the area sometime and see if any other tours are more impressive.","July 28, 2015",Reserve before arriving!,12,"Oconomowoc, Wisconsin",3

Mammoth Cave,If you have not gone you need to. I can't believe I have waited so long. Visitor Center is really nice and the exhibits are worth perusing. Lots of workers around to help with anything. We took The Historic and the Drips tour. Both were excellent and I would suggest. Would love to go back and do the 4 hour tours. Nice hiking trails around the center worth doing. The hotel and attached building are old and outdated. I believe a tear down is coming for those. We stayed in cave city and enjoyed that. It is nice to go to the Back Country and take the car ferry across the river. Many very long hiking trails. Would like to see them address that. The scenery is nice but it is always the same. No scenic points and few landscape changes. Not much they can do about that. Tours are the only think you need to pay for and they are reasonable.,"July 27, 2015",What a great place,13,Cincy,5

Mammoth Cave,"I love the national parks, but this one was a disappointment. Unfortunately, we were there on a hot summer weekend, and it was packed. They have a range of tours, but when we went online about a week before our visit, the smaller ones with fewer people were already booked. So we wound up going on the large historic tour: over 100 people. The rangers do a great job under very difficult circumstances, but they spend a lot of their time doing crowd control, so you receive minimal information.I am mystified why families think this would be a good experience for a very young child. We saw several children under the age of six on the tour, and most became bored very soon. The parents did their best to keep them interested and to avoid disturbing others, but it was a struggle. I also wonder why the park service doesn't impose an age limit. This would reduce crowds and revenue, so it must be a hard call to make. The portion of the cave we visited was unremarkable. I visited Carlsbad several years ago and found it much more impressive.","July 26, 2015",Too many people on the tours,259,New Mexico,3
Mammoth Cave,Loved our visit to Mammoth Cave. We took the 2 hour historical tour. An amazing sight and we hope to return. Tour guide was knowledgeable and funny.

Mammoth Cave,"We have visited other cave systems but none like this. The Park Rangers were extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and polite. Collen spoke with us for a short time on a personal matter I needed some information on. She was so helpful and always had a smile. The campground was great we used Recreation.Gov to book the site and the tour of the cave, (this was very easy to do). As far as the cave system we managed to do two tours. We did the Historic Tour at noon then drove around the park some more and hiked a few easy trails. Later in the evening we did the Focus on Niagra Tour. This started at the visitor's center were we met up and lined up in our cars to caravan to that part of the cave. The ranger was awesome, there was so much information and she wasn't in a hurry which was great!!!. I forgot her name, but I know that she is a local and her parents and grandparents worked in the cave system as guides. I highly recommend spending at least three to four days, there is more to the park than just the caves. The river was too high due to rain the week before so we couldn't go camping in the Green River, maybe next time. The ferry ride in our car was nice and gave us the opportunity to venture within the other side of the park and drive around.***there is no entrance fee to enter the park, nor for the ferry.

The only disappointing thing was that we were on a time schedule and by the time we got there, all the good tours were filled. We visited in July. This place gets very crowded. I suggest you get there a couple hours before to sign up for your hike. It is a lot of walking and some of it is very steep. Whatever you do- Do Not Eat at the walk up counter restaurant.

If we visit again when they are old enough for the more adventurous tours, I think it will be more worth the drive from Michigan.I was underprepared for how hot and humid it was for camping in July.

Mammoth Cave,"I have to tell you that the Violet City Lantern Tour is the best so far that I have taken there. The trip is so entertaining and family oriented that you would want to go back again. I give this tour a 10 for its historical content, length of time, things you will see, and you will carry a kerosene lamp all the time in your hands. It is an old school tour of the cave that will make you feel back in 1915 when the cave was being explored. ","July 23, 2015",Excelent Violet City Tour,7,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5
Mammoth Cave,"I have a very adventurous 2 and 5 year old and we opted to do the Frozen Niagara guided tour ($13 per adult, children are free). It lasted about an hour and fifteen minutes, including the bus ride from/to the Visitors Center. 45 minutes underground in the dark is the perfect amount of time for this age group. The cave was gorgeous and interesting... a very unique divergence from the hilly and equally beautiful landscape above in the park. My kids thought they were in The Goonies! Word of caution, some of the passages are very narrow and low - so if you're extremely claustrophobic you're probably not reading this review, and you really wouldn't like that part of it. There are also ""cave crickets"" that cling upside down to the ceiling of the cave (do all cave creatures hang upside down? I should've asked the ranger). They look quite a bit like spiders and if they catch you off guard can be quite off-putting! Additionally, the temperature was significantly lower in the subterrain than above ground (the heat index was 119, it was about 60 degrees in the cave... any longer than 45 minutes and we would've been cold) so maybe pack a sweatshirt or light long-sleeved shirt.All in all, can't wait to return here and try some more intrepid caving tours when my boys are older.","July 22, 2015",AMAZING!

Mammoth Cave,2 hour 2 mile tour was excellent. Tour guide very knowledgable and answered questions. Cave was cool but comfortable with t-shirt and capris. Tour could be improved with smaller groups. Prior to starting tour the guide warned the group about physical requirements for the tour which included going up 155 steps at one time and a total of 400 steps overall so that they could change tours. Children crying when going up steps due to fear of heights was a little distracting. ,"July 21, 2015",Historic Tour,23,"Massillon, Ohio, United States",5
Mammoth Cave,"After having visited Carlsbad Caverns and several other caves, I have to say that Mammoth was a letdown. All of the rocks are limestone and the same color, and except for the last part of the Domes and Dripstones tour, were not that unusual. Speaking of the Domes and Dripstones tour, Seniors beware!! We are a 70's couple in fairly good shape, but this was more than we bargained for!The first part of the tour is truly harrowing, The passageway going down is barely wide enough for one person, and there are parts where you have to bend down for quite awhile to avoid hitting your head. There are 270 steps down before you get to the first big room. The next section has a lot of uphill sections, but is a little less claustrophobic. An elderly couple on our tour were really frightened, and after barely making it to the first room, had to be rescued by a ranger who somehow got them out. Although you are warned about these things, I don't think the Park Service does quite enough in this regard. Our guide mentioned that every day at least a few people who start the tour but can not finish, have to be rescued. Besides seniors and claustrophobics, other groups that may have problems are heavyset people, very tall people and anybody with heart problems or bad knees.","July 21, 2015",Not nearly as spectacular as Carlsbad Caverns,64,"Slidell, La",3

Mammoth Cave,"My wife and I recently spent three days in Mammoth Cave National Park. To me, the scenery above ground was better than the cave tours. We stayed at the Mammoth Cave Hotel and in the late evenings (about 11:00 PM), you can go outside and see deer laying in the grass on the hotel grounds. They aren't afraid. We tried to photograph them one night and they just watched as we set up a tripod and snapped some photos. They didn't come out well because they don't hold still for the long exposure time needed, but it was still a nice experience.The drives around the park are very nice. Most of the roads are paved. The Joppa Ridge Drive is gravel and narrow, but it is a one way street, so no oncoming traffic and worth the drive, just go slow. There are several old cemeteries and churches on the property that are worth stopping at. Some of the graves are over 100 years old. We even saw the grave of Floyd Collins, a cave explorer who discovered many of the caves in that area and died in 1925 after becoming trapped in a passageway.We only took a couple of the tours and the Park Rangers are knowledgeable and make the tours fun. There are a lot of steps, so be in at least reasonable shape if you take any of the moderate tours. We saw several people having difficulty on some of the stairs. The hotel has a nice restaurant that is open most of the day and the food is very good. We ate there most mornings. There is a coffee shop that sell pre-packaged sandwiches and other snacks, but that is about it for food nearby. Everything else is probably in Cave City, about a 10 mile drive. So either bring food or eat at the hotel. Also, do some research on the trails prior to your arrival. The Visitor Center had surprisingly little information about the trail system in the park. And drive the speed limit. We didn't get a ticket, but we saw a few people pulled over that did.","July 21, 2015",Scenery alone worth the visit,41,"Houston, Texas",5
Mammoth Cave,"Took this tour with about 150 other people. The guide stopped to talk 3-4 times during the 2 hours and 2 miles. This tour is novel at the""fat man's misery"" and we thoroughly enjoyed squeezing and bending for probably a 100 ft. Other than that, it's big, plain and poorly lit.

Mammoth Cave,"I love caves and Mammoth is amazing. If only we had more time to do a 'wild' tour ! There are several tours to choose from and I chose the Historic Tour and booked online. It was good. I did not know that a lot of Mammoth Cave is 'dry' or 'dormant'. This particular tour enters in a natural entrance, which is phenomenal. The rest of the tour is mostly huge rooms and easy walking. There is one section (Fat Man's Misery) that is very tight and twisty and another section called Tall Man's Misery that you have to kind of squat to get through if you are tall. I'm short and was able to just kind of bend over to make it through. One downfall of most of the tours, is they are HUGE! 120 people on a tour is disappointing. I like to be able to talk to the guides and learn more as we are walking. Wasn't possible on this tour. We also had a little girl who was terrified of the dark and when they turned out the lights, she started screaming and crying. Having to listen to that for the next half hour or so was not fun. I think she finally figured out that she was not going to get anything fixed by screaming, plus was probably exhausted and the last part of the tour she was quiet.We decided to take a 2nd tour, as I like 'living' caves. So the Domes and Dripstones was our 2nd choice. Again, a huge group, but this one was much more to my liking. The trip down the narrow stairs was fun, I thought. The Frozen Niagara Falls was gorgeous and we spent many minutes ogling, while others came down the stairs and went back up immediately. I think those people missed the point of the tour. The Visitor Center exhibit is wonderful. The interpretive signs are excellent.I do want to go back again and take some of the other tours that are offered. The Star City Lantern one would be fun, as they turn off the lights and you go along with lanterns.Oh yes. The entrance to the Park is free. The cave tours are all fee based. However, there are lots of trails to hike, if you want to just enjoy the park and not necessarily the Cave.","July 20, 2015",Lots of tours to choose from.,13,CO,4

Mammoth Cave,"If you are expecting the typical stalactites,stalagmites, attractive and colorful deposits and other such features of many popular caves, you will be disappointed in most of this cavern. It is of course huge, but most of it is not accessible to the public. Some of our group took the ""Domes and Dripstones"" tour. This primarily involved many stairs through narrow, twisting areas as well as flatter sections through mostly uninteresting plain rock. There were no domes as such and little in the way of dripstones except as follows. Others of our group took the 'Frozen Niagara"" tour. This area is seen at the end of the ""D and D"" tour as well, and is far and away the most interesting part. It is what most people think of when they think of cave sights.

Mammoth Cave,"We stayed for two days, and took two different tours. Because I enjoy photography, we took the Focus on Frozen Niagara tour, which allows flash photography. On this tour, you see many formations that you often expect in a cave. They are remarkable! This tour, like most others, sells out quickly. I made reservations ahead of time online, and it paid off. The Frozen Niagara tour has approximately 15 stairs, so it is good for first-timers. It is about 55 degrees F in the cave, but shorts and T-shirt were fine for me. The other tour we took was the basic Mammoth Cave tour, which goes into the historic entrance. There are many more stairs to this tour, which does give you a work out.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth cave was OK but not great. We hit this attraction while driving back to Pennsylvania from the Crater of Diamonds in Arkansas (we also hit Graceland in TN on the way to Arkansas). I'm glad we did not make Mammoth our only destination on the 18+ hour drive. It would have been disappointing. Because we did not plan ahead and decided to book our tour the night before, the 3 best tours were all booked up (they are the 3+ hour tours that contain more cave exploration). YOU HAVE TO BOOK AHEAD AT LEAST A WEEK. As it were, we took the ""Historic Tour"". If you miss booking one of the top three you have to cobble a couple of the smaller ones together to get your money's worth. The Historic Tour was 2 - 1/2 hours through the main cave entrance, up to a certain point, and back the way you came in. The tour guide was right out of a movie. He was perfect, and I enjoyed his dry sense of humor, but he was not enough to make my kids want to add another tour. My kids (10 year old girl & 8 year old boy) who are both very good athletes (soccer, basketball, baseball, football), were surprisingly tired and bored after the 2 - 1/2 tour and wanted to go home. So did I and my wife. Sorry, once you are deep inside a big rock hole in the ground for 2+ hours, you really don't want to see more of the big rock hole in the ground. Maybe our experience would have been better of we got one of the top three longer tours, but i doubt it.","July 18, 2015",OK BUT NOT GREAT. SCHEDULE AHEAD OR YOU WILL NOT GET A GOOD TOUR,11,,3
Mammoth Cave,"We went to Luray Caverns a couple years ago and I thought it blew this away. There was not much to see, here. We did the Domes and Dripstones tour. I had wanted to do the History Tour. Maybe that would have been better. This one was disappointing, especially for the $15 per ticket price. If you go, you should try to reserve tickets ahead of time. They tend to sell out hours before the tour. You also want to wear shoes with good soles and dress for cool weather. (The caves are 54˚, even when it is in the 90s, outside.)The cave floors and stairs are wet and can be very slippery. The visitor center is nice and the people are very helpful. I just wish there was more to see down below.James","July 17, 2015","If you have been to Luray Caverns, no reason to go here",34,"Livonia, Michigan",3
Mammoth Cave,"Visiting daughter in Lex and she recommended the caves, so we decided to make a day out of it. We did last minute online reservations the night before for the 11:15AM Domes & Dripstones and 2:45PM Historic for Friday. This gave us plenty of time to have lunch and look around in between tours. For the D&D tour we hopped on a bus that took us to the cave entrance. The cave, while much cooler than the 95 deg outside, was not as cool as we expected (60's?) and we didn't wear jackets that we brought (this was not the case with the 2nd tour). The tour guide was funny. We saw cool formations and the hike and stairs were manageable for those of us who are not normally active. We were on the bus and back at the visitors center exactly 2hrs after leaving. We didn't pack a lunch so we decided to eat at the Park's hotel dining room. The three of us had burgers/fries/drink and the bill came out to $35.56. Waitress was nice enough to give us our refills in ""to-go"" cups without being asked. The Historic tour started with a short walk from the visitors center to the cave entrance. Since the first cave had some tight spaces, we decided to leave our backpacks. Daughter left her jacket and regretted it as soon as we were at the cave entrance which was very cool (50's?). Historic tour had beautiful rooms and passages despite not having many formations. It was our favorite of the two. As we aren't as petite as our daughter (I'm 5'9 and DH is 6'5"") we were nervous about Fat and Tall man's misery. DH was hunched over for a good portion of the low cave areas, pretty much after the large entrance passage 30 mins into the tour and for Tall Man, he was on his hands and crawled on the tips of his toes. He was not comfortable but got through it. There were some breaks and waiting until the bottleneck cleared in front of you helped so that he was not stuck in the bent position for extended periods of time but I'm sure he will be feeling it tomorrow. Despite the tight spots, he had a good time exploring and admitted to being ""bit by the cave bug"" and asked when we could come back to check out some of the other tours :)","July 17, 2015",Domes & Dripstones and Historic tours,28,"New York City, New York",5

It was perfect for our family with younger children. We were able to complete the visit within about 1.5 hours. Rangers were available along the trail to answer questions.

Mammoth Cave,"This is a beautiful national park. While it is famous for its caves, there are also above ground activities such as hiking and trails that you can walk. If you are going in the summer, be sure to go online and book your tour tickets in advance, because they do fill up. There are are variety of tours to chose from. Ive got small kids so I chose the Frozen Niagra tour, which was nice and easy, good for young kids. That particular tour lasts about an hour and a half. CHeck the website for tour descriptions to pick a tour that suits your interests and physical abilities. For the Frozen Niagra tour, you take a 15 minute bus ride from the visitor center to the cave entrance. The cave is nice and cool (about 60 degrees). While the cave is nice, in my opinion, the formations are not as breathtaking as Luray Caverns, but it is worth a visit just the same. The tour guide/park ranger was friendly and knowledgeable. about the area and you learn the history of the park. While you are waiting for your tour, you can stroll the grounds of the visitor center, there is a wooden plank one mile loop thats nice to walk, and you can walk to one of the cave entrances and feel the cool air coming out. When your tour finishes, they have you walk in some soapy water to help stop the spread of some disease that is killing bats in the cave. Definitely worth a visit.","July 15, 2015",Nice national park and cave tours,105,"Mount Holly, New Jersey",4
Mammoth Cave,"Recently my husband and I returned for the second time to Mammoth Cave and went on the most strenuous tours offered. We were in a group of 14 which had several international individuals who did not all speak English as their first language. The lead ranger was quite strict, which is to be expected based on the dangerous aspects of the tour, but he made side comments that I felt were disrespectful of the international group. Generally abrasive and rude, never spoke directly to a tour group member unless delivering his ""schpeil"" or delivering orders.","July 15, 2015","Variety of tours, but rangers lacking people skills",5,"Elkhorn, Wisconsin, United States",4

Temperatures are around 54°, so a light jacket to sweat shirt might be desired. Most of our tour had shorts on and a light jacket.

Mammoth Cave,"This was our 2nd tour of the day and our ranger was awesome! His name escapes me though :-( Our group was aged 12-51 and they enjoyed this one more than the Grand Ave. tour. This tour is done only by lanterns carried by the guests, no electrical lighting to give you a taste of what it was like 100 years ago to be exploring these caves. It was 3 hours, or 3 miles long. NO BATHROOMS AVAILABLE! It was a bit uncomfortable for my 12 year old that needed to go 1/2 way thru the tour. We got a ton of information about the history of the caves, how they did things in the early years of tours. It gives you a totally different view on the caves to see it only in view of a handful of lanterns. This was is listed as strenuous. Most of it is flat, but the 2nd half gets a little more treacherous with steeps hills, stairs and no handrails in quite a bit of darkness. Definitely not for little kids. This tour starts at the Historical Entrance, which is a natural entrance for the cave system. You can walk there from the visitor's center. If you don't take a tour that starts from this entrance, make sure you walk over there to see it, it's incredible.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Caves are the longest network of caves on Earth known to mankind. The enormous chambers and endless labyrinths of precarious pathways definitely deserve a visit by any nature-lover. While no one knows how much cave is down here, explorers have surveyed and mapped about 400 miles (this is not a typo) of passage. Mammoth Cave National Park have worked to develop ranger-led cave trips for the general public to explore the caves. Out of the 11 tour options that the park offers, I highly recommend two:a) Historic Tours - Great for families. Follow the spirit of Stephen Bishop, the 17 year old boy who explored the caves in early 19th century ALONE b) Domes and Dripstones Tour - Great complement to the Historic tour. Explore grand domes and pits. Educational to people who want to understand how were these caves formed. Few Tips: - Online/Prior reservation is not mandatory but highly recommended as the most popular trips are frequently sold out - Wear your walking shoes as most tours expect guests to walk 2-4 miles- Flash photography is not permitted- Free guest parking is available but busy - Be careful so as to not spread the WNS - A disease that has killed millions of bats.

Although we've left the park around 3-ish, we could have easily walked other trails. The park outside the caves are equally beautiful as the caves; just a different kind of beauty - the sunshine and green lush, or their lack, make a big difference! Neither of us or our two daughters (12 and 13 year-old) are athletic folks. We like hiking but none of us kills hours in a gym :) Climbing the stairs out of the caves and the uphill trail from the spring were each doable and not too exhausting.

Mammoth Cave,"Don't think the only thing you can do at Mammoth Cave National Park is explore the cave. Yes, that is certainly the main focus of the national park. There are a variety of tours available, ranging in price (as of summer 2015) from $12 to $55 (for a six-hour, physically demanding tour of the cave that has size restrictions because of the tight squeezes). However, there is plenty to do above ground for those who don't want to venture into the cave. Best of all, most of the above-ground activities are free.The thing I enjoy the most is the Heritage Trail. This ""hike"" of less than a mile is on a handicap accessible trail. The highlight of the trail is Sunset Point, which is a gorgeous view of the valley. It is stunning in the fall during the color change. This trail is level and very easy for families with strollers or those pushing companions in wheelchairs.Other hiking trails throughout the park are more physically demanding but rewarding. The River Styx Spring trail is less than a mile one-way but it is demanding for those with physical difficulties. Healthy persons should be able to navigate the trail with no difficulty. The reward is views of the River Styx and the Green River.Canoes are available for rent for personal adventures on the Green River. The park also has trails for horseback riding and bicycles. Driving through the park offers the chance to see deer, elk, and wild turkey.If you're interested in the cave there are a wide variety of tour options.

The visitor's center was really cool and informative. We have 4 kids including a 3 year old so I decided to take the very easy tour--Frozen Niagara. You're probably in the cave for like 30-40 minutes. It was just a little introduction to the cave--most people on this tour had small children. The older kids ages 8, 10, and 12 went on the ""Trog"" tour. This was awesome! The place it starts is kind of confusing--it was on the hotel side by the tennis courts--there is a brown building there. Just ask around there are many rangers walking around. They suited the kids up in a jumpsuit, knee pads, and a lighted helmet--you help them with this. They took them on a tour where they even had to crawl in some parts! The kids really loved it. It was a good 2 hours. At the end of their tour you had to meet them at the Historic Entrance and they were tired and thirsty!

As it happens, we actually really enjoyed the tour we did....the Mammoth passage which was just over an hour and cost $7 each. The guide was really interesting and we definitely learnt a whole lot more than we would by reading the boards located in the passages. The walk through the cave was really easy. Flash photography is not allowed so take a good camera with you if you want decent photos. The tour recommended to us was the Historical tour, which was over two hours, costing $14 each. I think you would see a lot more different things if you did this one but if you only want a short, easy experience, then the Mammoth Passage is fine. Remember to bring a coat, whatever tour you do as it is really cold down in the cave. There are also things to see above the ground. Make sure you stop off at the Sloan's Pond and also the Green River Ferry. The latter is fabulous to see even if you do not actually use it. Another good National Park Experience all round.","July 5, 2015",Great underground experience!,203,"Scotland, United Kingdom",4
Mammoth Cave,"Wonderful tour. Beautiful park. Great cave tour. Knowledgeable guide. Our family took the historic tour. It was great fun. The walking was not difficult for us. However, the staircase at the end is long and straight up. Great fun. We did have dinner at the lodge. It was a simple, tasty meal. The waitstaff was kind and helpful. We would recommend having a meal at the lodge when you come for a tour.","July 5, 2015",Wonderful tour,15,"Memphis, Tennessee",5
Mammoth Cave,Took the Historic Tour and was not disappointed. Our guides Rangers Larry and Rick did a great job. The cave entrance (for the historic tour) was really cool. Make sure you make reservations ahead of time. Buy your tickets early. The day I went every single tour was sold out for the Historic Tour and each tour had 120 slots. Also when you buy your tickets early make sure you take your all your papers to the desk inside the building to get your real tickets and to find out where your group is going to meet up at. I recommend getting to the cave at least half an hour before your tour starts.,"July 5, 2015",Mammoth Cave,63,"Evansville, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"We went on the domes and dripstones tour and I have to say we were highly disappointed. Having been twice in the past, once in the 80's and again in the late 90's, the changes have taken away from the experience of being in the world's largest cave system in favor in getting more people through the caves more quickly (more money). The Frozen Niagra tour would have been much easier and just as ornamental. There were 3 ""stops"" on the tour, all of which were large caverns with rows of benchs for the 118 people on the tour (several had to stand). There was very little to see on the stops. The first stop comes after a steep 280 stair decent on steep steel stairs with slippery rails, low ceilings, and tight spaces. The view going down was better than the ""stops"" and you were rushed through and had no time to admire the view or take pictures. When you arrive at Grand Central, you wait about 30 minutes for the rest of your group. Once there, the tour guides (who were great) go over 5 minutes of info and answer 10 minutes of questions. Then it's a steep climb up alternating smooth and rough terrain where you have to hold onto rails and sometimes use your upper body strength to pull yourself up. You wait another 30 minutes on your party in the fairy ceiling area of the tour and repeat the same process. Some more climbing and you reach the last ""stop"" where you stand and are told not to touch the scenery and go to the ""Frozen Niagra."" This was the enjoyable part of the tour, but there was limited time for photography. There were 4 people in our party and we all agreed that it wasn't worth the hike to see the rest of the tour. If Mammoth Cave National Park reads this review, I recommend restricting the tours to half the size (at most) and to plan for more time to enjoy the experience. ","July 4, 2015",Disapointed,12,,3
Mammoth Cave,"We planned a last minute trip to Mammoth Cave to escape the monsoon season we here in Nashville have found ourselves in. Just a quick trip up on Friday afternoon and back on Saturday. Thinking we would see when they opened the next day, Friday night in the hotel room, we hopped on the Mammoth Cave website and quickly realized that not only do they offer cave tour reservations but they are absolutely necessary! You can't make them same day and many (most) of the tours were already sold out including the 2 in which we were interested. :( They offer a self-guided tour that does not require tickets so we decided to just show up early and see what happened. As we stood in line with people who looked like they were geared up, head to toe, to spend MONTHS underground, and some nut lady wearing flip flops, I noticed everyone was holding a piece of paper...presumably their confirmation of the tour they booked however long ago. How did they know? Maybe every other review on here says what I'm saying. We just took off on a whim and had no idea and did not research. I'm just trying to spare anyone else of this. We made our way to a ticket agent and were resigned to doing the short, sad, uninformative self-guided tour but he clickety-clacked his computer and said he could get us in on an upcoming Historical Tour. It was 2 miles, 2 hours, 400 steps, rated: moderate. It was just right. The guide was great, it's well lighted inside, I only tripped once and banged the mess out of my head once. You get to see many of the famous features (huge, cavernous open spaces, Giant's Coffin, Fat Man's Misery, Tall Man's Misery). Here's what you need to do to enjoy a cave tour at Mammoth:Step 1: Choose which one you want and make reservations.Step 2: Wear good shoes. They don't have to be expensive hiking boots; tennis shoes are sufficient. But no Crocs and definitely no flip flops. There are steps, inclines, uneven terrain, it's dark and some spots were wet/slippery.Step 3: a long sleeved shirt or a light sweater/jacket would feel nice in the cave in summer. Today (July 4, 2015) it was 80 at the surface and a chilly 54 degrees down in the cave. I was wearing a long sleeved t and shorts and was comfortable. I can see in winter maybe wanting a little more but they say it hovers around 54 year round.Step 4: Don't be a pack mule. I saw ladies with purses slung over their shoulders and people with packs like they were planning on spending the night. You just don't need anything in there. If you must, take a camera or phone with you. Flash photography is not allowed so any pics you take are likely not going to turn out. You're too busy watching your step and headspace to be staring at a phone or digging in your bag. And anything else you might think of carrying in, save for medical devices/supplies, you can do without. Less is more here. Lighten the load and enjoy the sights.","July 4, 2015",No reservations? No Go.,19,"Brentwood, Tennessee",4
Mammoth Cave,Our park rangers were excellent guides who told us a great deal about the cave and its history. The introduction to the tour is much more terrifying than the reality of it!

Mammoth Cave,"Spent a week in this national park and were never at a loss for adventures. We stayed in the Mammoth Cave Hotel for our first night, then camped at the central campground for the duration of the trip. Between kayaking, caving, fishing, hiking, antiquing, and visiting some of the surrounding cities (bourbon and a brewery in Bowling Green, Chaser's Kentucky Chocolates in Cave City, rappelling at Hidden River Cave in Horse Cave City, etc.) this was a trip to remember.

Mammoth Cave,It saddens me that Mammoth Cave doesn't get as much attention as other National Parks. You do not have to be a lover of cave exploration to understand why this cave deserves more attention. The guides are almost always tollerant of questions. Their knowledge is impressive.

Mammoth Cave,"i have taken my family members there at least three time over a 8 year period; and was fascinated each visit. i had to make a lot of business trips to Michigan and sometimes made it a family road trip. getting to the caves is off the main highway, but found it worth the time. i recommend the long tours if time permits. i also recommend going in the early morning because the tour groups are smaller. this makes the tour guide easier to here and some bottle-neck locations quicker to get through. i also recommend allowing some time for walking the grounds and visiting the gift shop.","July 4, 2015",Great place to visit during a road trip...,27,"Austin, Texas",5

Most of the tours were sold out for the next 2 hours. The two hour ranger lead tours have a limit of 100-160 attendees so they file up fast. Great tour that my grandkids would enjoy immensely.

Mammoth Cave,"This was a spur-of-the-moment visit for us. My granddaughter and I were traveling thru Kentucky and stopped at Litchfield for a break. We saw the sign for Mammoth Cave about 25 miles south and decided it would be a good side trip. First, if you're in a hurry, enter Mammoth Park from interstate 65 on the east side. If not, the trip from Litchfield (north) is interesting, especially when the road begins to narrow, winding down the hills and abruptly stops at a little two-car river ferry. We LOVED it! After crossing on the ferry, we entered the park and found the visitors center.We took the 1+ hr tour (Historic) and wished we had gone for the stalactites and domes venture. After descending the stairs into the cave, we walked along a tunnel with low ceilings that opened up into a very large room. Here we learned a lot of 1800s history including the role the salt peter mine played in production of white gun powder during the revolutionary war. Well preserved equipment from the era was interesting to see. We had an excellent guide who struggled with a screaming kid the whole time we were in the cave. It was so bad, we couldn't hear half of the narration, and people would migrate trying to get away from the mom and kid. Really ruined the experience.After having been on many cave tours, I was expecting a lot more ""scenic"" experience, stalactites, stalagmites, rivers, etc. but all you see is this one GIGANTIC room. My fault. I should have done some research. However, it WAS spur of the moment. Oh well. It was very reasonably priced and I would definitely recommend putting this on your list. Nice visitors area and gift shop. Rangers are friendly and informative.Another thing, when they say people with physical limitations, heart conditions, etc. should reconsider, please pay attention. There is a fairly long walk down a hill to the mouth of the cave, then a lot of stairs descending into the cave. All the way down, I'm thinking, ""I've got to go back UP this thing!"" I'm almost 70 years old and in good shape, but had to stop twice to catch my breath while going back up the hill. Not for the faint of heart.","July 2, 2015",Not what I was expecting but still enjoyed,16,Mid South,4
Mammoth Cave,"This cave is very historical. Corse then again I signed up for the historical tour. The Historical Tour takes about 2 hours, and is 2 miles long. This particular cave has fat mans misery, and tall mans agony. I'm about 5 foot 5 inches and I was hunched over so far I could touch my toes. I weigh about 120 pounds and in fat mans misery I probably looked like I was dancing. I was weaving so much. It's truly not that bad though. It's a fun and interesting tour. There is some formations. The ranger guides where very informative, and made it easy to understand. It is decently priced for what you get. The only bad thing was It was such a large group you had to be to the front to hear what the ranger guide was saying except for when we stopped to talk about something. They let you ask lots of questions so if you have any curious little ones defiantly take this tour! Also where a sweatshirt of jacket because its about 50 degrees fahrenheit!","July 2, 2015",Very historical,12,"Rochester, New York",4

The ranger leading the group was very informative.The first part of the tour is walking down into the cave via stairs. I thought it was pretty cool to experience. Eventually you walk into a big open area where you sit down and the ranger talks about the cave etc. It was kind of an odd feeling looking around realizing how much earth was above me...the giant slab of rock above my head. The Frozen Niagra area had to most ""traditional"" cave features. This area was very pretty. I thought the whole tour was great and appreciate all aspects of the cave. It is the longest cave system in the world at 400+ miles. Definitely worth the $15 ticket. I would love to go back and do their Introduction to Caving Tour.","July 1, 2015",Awesome and Informative Tour,15,Illinois,5
Mammoth Cave,"I guess we hadn't done our research on this one. The caprock makes this a dry and rather dull cave if you're comparing it to Carlsbad or Meramec. No stalactites or stalagmites - just a very large, cool cave. Our six children ranged from 13 to 4 and the guide (who must have been as old and dry as the cave) kept making negative comments about kids, saying he knows they want to touch things they shouldn't and the like. All the kids on our tour (including ours) were as good as gold yet he kept making these remarks. Would definitely not go again.","June 30, 2015",A Mammoth Disappointment,22,FL,3

Mammoth Cave,"Had a great experience! The main tour guide/Ranger was not as good as the guy who tailed our group. We stuck with him, and he answered all questions happily and provided cool info about things as we walked past. The Historic Tour was, indeed, quite packed with early 1800s history, and I'm glad we took it. I understand the other tours offer MUCH more ""scenic"" (ie: stalactites and stalagmites, columns, pools, formations... what people normally think of when you tell them you went into a cave) attractions, as the Historic tour had virtually no natural features. There are some very cool (and DEEP) ravines & waterfalls, and tons of pre-Civil War machinery used to mine nitrites for bombs/rockets. The graffiti was very cool, and preserved enough that I thought it was very recent (only to find out it was almost 200 years old).Overall, great trip and worth the time and $$$. The cave is VERY chilly, and we weren't prepared, so we invested in some branded hoodies to commemorate our trip. I live in FL, though, so may never use them again. Oh well. Plan better.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave National Park was one of our stops on the way back home after spending almost 3 weeks visiting many of our National Parks along the I-95 corridor. We were not quite sure if we would be able to take a cave tour since there were no tickets available online when checking a few days before. We arrived shortly after the park opened and were pleasantly surprised that there WERE ticket still available. We took the 9:30 historic tour which lasted 2 hours. You will walk about 2 miles during this tour. Living in Florida, the cool temperatures inside the cave were a welcome relief from the summer heat we are used to. My wife and I did have a sweatshirt and jacket on during the tour to keep us from getting too cold. Most of the tour takes you through relatively wide passageways and into a couple of very large underground rooms. Participants will also walk through a few narrow passageways and up 150 step tower toward the end of the tour. I am not fond of tight places or heights but found neither of these obstacles bothered me too much. My wife and I are certainly glad we spent the money for the tickets and spent the time touring the cave. After all, the cave IS what this park is all about. By the way, our tour guide was not only knowledgeable, but had the entire group laughing during the 3 or 4 stops that we made during the tour. Mammoth Cave NP is also one of the few National Parks that has set aside a trail that allows bikers to ride on. We took the Railroad Bike & Hike trail about 1/2 hour one way until we reached Sloan's Crossing Pond...about 3 miles from the trailhead. The full length of this trail is actually 9 miles long and terminates just before reaching Park City. The trail follows Mammoth Cave Parkway, so you are also within a few hundred yards of the road. The trail allowed us to see what the landscape looks like above the cave. It was definitely worth taking some time to ride or walk the trail. The trail has some hills but not too difficult for two 50+ adults to handle. Be sure to make to take water with you. The camp store found at the beginning of the trail is a great place to stock up on water/snacks.This is a very unique park.

Mammoth Cave,"The caves are pretty awesome. Totally worth seeing. We went on two tours - the historical tour and the domes and dripstones tour. Both were well done but the tour groups are very large (100 people) which makes it hard to hear sometimes and there were people who didn't turn off their phones during the dark demonstration which kind of ruined the whole experience. Also check to see if you have been assigned to a tour with school groups. We were the only adults not part of the giant elementary school group domes tour. The advantage was that we stuck by the guide and he gave us a lot of attention. The downside was it was very loud and a bit of drama at times. The teachers tried hard but the kids were excited (it was nice to see them so excited about the environment but tough on the ears). We were offered tickets to a later tour but could not do time wise. Tours sell out and we had bought ours in advance. Of note, they caution on health issues. I have asthma, bad knees, and mild claustrophobia and did not have a problem with either tour. There are a LOT of stairs but the pace is slow enough to not be much of a problem. It can be slippery in places though so non-slip shoes are helpful.

Mammoth Cave,"My sister and I go on a road trip every year. This year's trip involved 5 caves. Mammoth Caves, while certainly the largest of the bunch, is firmly in last place in my book.We went on the Domes and Dripstones Tour, as that was the only tour available to us, despite ordering tickets several weeks before our visit. Tickets were $15 per person for a 2-hour tour, but I think the 2-hours includes the bus ride there and back again.The tour guide was informative and funny, when you could hear her. We were in a huge group (it took 3 buses to get us all there) and most of the time she spoke quietly so that only those closest to her would be able to hear.I heard absolutely nothing on the descent and felt incredibly rushed, so I just focused on the stairs leading down into the cave. There are some tight spots, but even wearing a women's size 28, I was able to fit everywhere. When we all made it down the stairs, we sat and heard a little bit about the cave. This is the only real talk that was given, though she did open it up to a Q & A, which was nice. For the remainder of the trip, there were lots of ups and downs, ramps and stairs, but no other stops. It was difficult to keep up and I didn't get the chance to see much at all. Luckily, mammoth caves doesn't have much in the way of formations, so I don't think I missed much. Overall, make sure you bring comfortable shoes, because there is a lot of walking, but you can skip the camera, because there isn't much to see here. Try to get up close to the ranger, as that's the only way you're going to be able to hear anything.If you have trouble walking or navigating stairs, skip this altogether. (For reference, I can easily walk a mile at a relaxed pace and can walk up a couple flights of stairs without getting too winded, but the pacing and ups and downs of this cave were quite strenuous for me).","June 25, 2015","Disappointing, Actually",29,"West Lafayette, Indiana, United States",3

Mammoth Cave,"If I am standing in a room that spans 3 acres in a cave with only a lantern for light- guess how much I can appreciate this?! This could be a 20 square foot room and it would look the same. (sigh) I guess I have to take the guides' word that this is a spectacular sight.This is another Mammoth Cave tour that moves WAY too fast! The tour guides walk so quickly it is very difficult to appreciate the cave. Seeing the cave by lantern light is a very unique way to go through the cave. I have done a similar tour in caves out in New Mexico- this one moves too quick! Between the limited light and the speed, you will not thoroughly enjoy the experience. This is also not the type of cave that has many formations, so don't expect too much.This is a very brisk hike through a cave that gives you a good, cool workout, though. Be sure you are prepared for and able to do this hike! There are a few VERY steep inclines to walk up. One person in our tour group had to crawl up one of the slopes, because she couldn't handle walking.

And bring a light jacket or sweatshirt because even though it was sweltering hot out, we got cold in the cave. We expected more stalactites and stalacmites. We went on the domes and dripstones and got the little niagra (?) tour at the end. THat was the best part if you don't have much time. But do domes if you have time.

Mammoth Cave,"My family and I went on the historic tour. We were very impressed with the cave and its size. The large caverns are amazing. We had no problems with any of the pathways. We thought this was an easy tour, though some may not think so.The one thing we were disappointed with is the number of people on each tour. With well over 100 people on the tour you don't get to learn about the cave every step of the way. The tour is structured such that the tour guide talks to the whole group and then you walk a long ways to the next stopping point where the tour guide again talks to the whole group. Having toured Wind Cave and Jewel Cave in the Black Hills of SD we were expecting a more intimate tour with fewer people where the tour guide talks the entire way throughout so you can learn about the geology of the cave as you walk through it. Even still, we enjoyed the cave. If you like touring caves you have to stop here.","June 23, 2015",Definitely a mamoth cave,35,"Mitchell, South Dakota",4

Mammoth Cave,We went to Mammoth cave for three days and it was the best experience we had. The caves are great to see and enjoy. \ There are various tours and we can pick and choose the tours to suit our convenience. The visitors center is great with lots of exhibits and many educative displays and pictures. There are buses which take us to the mouth of the caves and from there we need to talk a bit to get into the caves. Some tours are hard and the path inside the caes are narrow and place dark. People with difficulty breathing and/or walking should not attempt the tours. There are some ery easy and small tours. Heavy rush and number of trips limited.

It's considered moderate in exertion, because there are a few stairs and inclines. You will see the tuberculosis huts, cave Graffitti from the 1800's, the ""coffin"" in the Rotunda, cave illusions, etc. You will hear tons of fun stories, Civil War stories, Native American stories, etc. Buy your tickets in advance, because this is popular and always sells out.","June 21, 2015",Mammoth Cave Starlight Tour - By Lantern- Purchase in Advance-Limited,59,"Louisville, Kentucky",4

Mammoth Cave,"The first time I went here was many years ago as a small child. I remember having a panic attack at the entrance of the cave. I am very very claustrophobic. Anyhow moving on. I booked the historic tour for me my husband and 2 kids. On the wed site it did say don't do the tour if you are claustrophobic. It had said this would not be good for you. It didn't go in to detail to much on exactly what you would be doing on the 2 hour tour. When we arrived at the cave the guide had told us about the tour before we all went on it. They were not kidding around when they said it's not for you if you are claustrophobic. The guy said you would be in very small spaces to the point of getting on your knees and going through the cave at times. He said the walls would literally be right up next to you. Once in you have to go through the entire cave you can not turn around!! I didn't go on this. 12.00 wasted but I didn't care. There is no way I could do it. I would have had an attack right there. Just a heads up to ask ask ask questions before you book because tickets are non refundable! Really wish I coulda did it but there's no way. I'm not gonna rate this as terrible because my kids and husband had a wonderful time, just not for me. Not with having the phobia and panic attacks.","June 20, 2015",Historic tour,4,ky,4

Mammoth Cave,"While it is the longest cave in the world, it is not necessarily the most decorated. That said, it is pretty impressive. The grounds are nice and hiking in the area would have been lovely, however, there were severe thunderstorms approaching as we emerged from the cave. They make a big deal about the steps down and offer many health advisories. For the average person, it is not a big deal...the incline back up is very gradual. I've done many other cave tours throughout the world and know that each one is different. Slovenia has Skojan and Postonia which are spectacularly back-lit with dramatic lighting to show off all the elaborate natural features. Eisreisenwelt in Austria is also incredibly dramatic. This is not one of those...but it is interesting, nonetheless, and worth the trip. If we ever make it back, we hope to do a cave crawl tour.","June 15, 2015",Cool National Park,7,,4

There wasn't much to the tour but going down a steel ladder through a crevass, down 200' then walking to the one attraction within the cave tour.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave is one of those places that everyone should see once in their life. But after being in several caves, I have to say that Mammoth Cave was a bit disappointing. My sister and I did the Domes and Dripstones Tour and it really wasn't all that impressive. The ranger, whom was charming, funny, and knowledgeable, informed us that those of us who wanted to go at a slower pace could stay near her. My sister and I ended up in the middle because of the people with kids and the elderly being in the front. But if you must go slow, or want to go slow to see things, you HAVE to be in the front. For the initial trek down the stairs, we went FAST and had no time to really see anything without causing a massive gap. The tour was huge- we took three buses to get to the entrance- and we missed out on a lot of the information since we were nowhere near the ranger. After the first stop, we got near the front and things were a lot better from there.If you are fat and worried about fitting through some of the tight spaces- I wear a size 30 in women's clothing and fit through. Yes, there are some tight squeezes. If you're claustrophobic, don't go. The Domes and Dripstones Tour also has TONS of stairs and ramps, so if you have bad knees or backs, you might want to consider a different tour. Unfortunately for my sister and I, at one point in the tour, we were stuck behind some obnoxious teen and her father who made little quips about the fact that we were fat and out of breath after walking up a large flight of stairs, so be wary of ~those~ kinds of people. After the cave tour, we had went through the mixture of Woolite and water to clear away any fungus picked up which is killing bats (which was good because we went to four other caves in other cities), and then went to the Mammoth Cave hotel for lunch. The Mammoth Burger was very tasty and the waitress very lovely. Afterwards, we decided to walk some of the trails. We started out on the Heritage trail. It's scenic, but there's not much to look at once you've gotten bored of the trees. So, we started downhill to the River Styx trail. The trail from the Heritage Trail down was in desperate need of repair, and I don't advise anyone who may have bad knees or a bad back to walk it as there are no benches to stop and rest. The built in stairs (wood in the ground, filled with gravel) are really messed up. Eventually, you hit the trail that leads down to the original cave entrance. The River Styx, though, was not very impressive, but the cave entrance was. Unfortunately, it was a difficult walk back up from the River Styx. It's a long, uphill, half-mile trek up a ramp. By the end of the day, our legs were very sore and my thighs hurt going up or downhill for the next three days, so definitely make sure you know what you're getting into and make sure you do appropriate stretches, and if you're out of shape, maybe don't do a moderate cave tour followed by a difficult trail.","June 14, 2015",It's Fine,59,"West Lafayette, Indiana",3
Mammoth Cave,I took my 8 year old twin boys to this national park and did the Domes and Dripstones tour. They have a ton of tour options running all the time. So you can do a different one every time you come. Huge system of caves. Very friendly staff. Beautiful park. Cool little museum inside the visitor's center my sons loved. The park has picnic areas and camping areas and hiking trails etc. We just did the cave tour. Our tour included a bus ride to a small entrance. The tour scared one of my sons at first because you walk down a billion steel stairs. But he got over it. I was not aware that was what it entailed. So might scare some kids. Other tours take easier paths and others take harder paths. Bring good walking shoes and ones you don't mind getting dirty. It stays cool in the cave but with the exertion of walking and climbing we did not get cold wearing shorts and t shirts. Some people did have jackets. Very informative and fun cave tour. I highly recommend. Just make sure you pick the right tour for your group. Plenty of free parking. Beautiful grounds.,"June 14, 2015",lots of cave tour options,292,"Soddy Daisy, Tennessee",4
Mammoth Cave,"We just got back from a weekend trip to Mammoth Cave, where we took the Historic tour and the Domes and Dripstones tour. Both were great, but I have a few tips and advice for people looking to tour Mammoth Cave. First, I went with my husband (we're both in our mid-thirties and exercise regularly) and my parents (in their mid-sixties, not fitness fanatics but both in sound health). I'd reserved our cave tour tickets online in advance, at which time my credit card had been charged, so when we got inside the visitor center, all I had to do was tell the cashier my name and she printed out our actual tickets (which the cave guide collects as you enter the tour). Tours do sell out, so if you don't figure out ahead of time when you want to go, beware that your first choice of tour time might not be available when you show up. Our cashier said that the mid-morning and midday tours are the fullest ones.Since we had over an hour to kill before our first tour (we took the Historic tour on Friday and the Domes and Dripstones tour on Saturday), we checked out a large interactive exhibit inside the Visitor Center (it was free to go through), which I'd highly recommend you do prior to any cave tour as it explains a lot of historical and geological background on how/when the cave was formed, first explored, what kind of wildlife lives inside it, etc.Also inside the Visitor's Center are two gift shops: a store that had a variety of books, toys, postcards/keychains/typical souvenir items, and some really cute stuffed animals, and then a separate t-shirt/apparel shop back toward the exits leading out to the shelters where tours depart. I thought all the prices were fair and the quality really good (definitely superior to any of the tacky, ""old-timey"" shops you'll pass on your way to the park). Gift-shop aficionados, pay attention: there is another gift shop in the Mammoth Cave Hotel building next door that has its own, separate assortment of gifts--different t-shirt styles than what you'll find in the visitor center, jewelry, different stuffed animals, and even glassware (we snagged some neat Mammoth Cave wine glasses and a cocktail tumbler there!). So, if you see something you like in one gift shop, buy it there because it likely won't be available in the other shop. There was also a shop that seemed to specialize in garden- and horse-themed housewares and accessories in the lower level of the hotel building. Nothing there was specific to Mammoth Cave, though.Now, about the Historic cave tour: you can get the basic facts on the park's website, but one thing it might not warn you is that, depending on the time of year, the cave could be significantly cooler inside than the weather is outside. The total tour time is 2 hours, but for much of that time, you're standing still listening as your tour guide explains this and that. No benches anywhere inside the cave and you aren't allowed to sit down, so make sure you're okay with standing still for longish stretches of time. Also, if you chill easily and it's a warm day when you go, bring a sweatshirt or light jacket (three of us ended up putting on sweatshirts at some point in the tour). Wear shoes with good grip, as there's lots of stairs to climb and plenty of areas where you could slip easily in flip flops or dressier shoes. I enjoyed the Historic Tour, but most of the areas you'll see on this one are large cavernous rooms, with one important exception: a portion of the cave called ""Fat Man's Misery"" in which you have to walk, slightly hunched due to the low ceiling, through a winding little passageway that really would be tough for anyone over a certain weight. The constricting part only rose to about my waist--I could stretch my arms out in any direction but couldn't put my legs apart more than maybe four or five inches. There were a couple of very pregnant women on our tour, and they made it through somehow, so don't let it scare you off if you're a bigger person--just be ready for some pinching or be able to suck it in! Near the end of the tour is a very tall staircase that winds upward through Mammoth Dome (I think this is what it's called), so if you have trouble with stairs, be warned. There are landings for people to pause and rest, but you aren't getting out of the cave any other way.About the Domes and Dripstones tour, which we did Saturday morning: I LOVED this one!!! The Historic Tour was a nice intro to the cave, but Domes/Dripstones gave me what I was craving in terms of cave scenery--some breathtaking stalactites and flowstone. However, this tour takes you through a lot of very narrow passageways where crouching and pivoting are essential if you don't want to bonk your head. Also, there are tons of stairs on this one, mostly on the descent into the cave. If you're scared at all of bugs, also, beware that you might see a fair number of cave crickets (which actually look a lot like spiders) and even some spiders, too. Our tour guide warned us, in all seriousness, that a bug could fall on anyone at any time--if this worries you, I recommend wearing some kind of hat (I wish I would have, just to set my mind at ease)! To enter the cave, you have to go through an air lock that's about twenty steps--during this part, my hubby joyfully pointed out two very large spiders up on the ceiling. You descend the stairs single-file, so once you're inside the door, there's no going back. Seriously, if you're highly scared of spiders, do as I did and just don't look up. Once we were inside the cave itself, we saw no more spiders...and the rock formations were beautiful enough to compensate for the squeamish journey in. Between the two tours, I found Domes/Dripstones superior to the Historic, just because it met my expectations of what a cave should look like at its most majestic. However, the Historic tour included a lot more lecturing, which I appreciate when I'm visiting a place I know nothing about. I recommend doing both tours in the same order we did them: Historic first, Domes/Dripstones after. You could even do both on the same day, maybe Historic in the morning, then a break for lunch, and then Domes/Dripstones in the afternoon. We did not eat on the property, so I can't vouch for the quality of food in the hotel restaurant. They were getting plenty of business, though, so it must have been alright. Both of our tour guides were fantastic--very knowledgeable when asked impromptu questions and really good-humored. It was an unforgettable experience, and as Mammoth Cave is the longest known cave system in the whole world, you owe it to yourself and Mother Nature to check it out!","June 14, 2015",Took two awesome tours: Historic and Domes/Dripstones,48,"Bloomington, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"I've been in many caves over the years, some as a tourist and some as a cave mapper. Mammoth cave may be huge but it doesn't have very dramatic formations (at least not in the sections available to tourists). I was very unhappy with the fact that groups of teenagers were climbing piles of rocks to have photos taken as they could knock a rock loose onto someone below. Fine if you've never been in a cave before but kind of boring otherwise. The park itself has miles of hiking and biking trails which are probably great for locals but not worth a trip from any distance. That said, the US National Parks are absolute treasures and they do a good job with the cave. ","June 14, 2015",ok if you have never been in a cave before,149,"Edwardsburg, Michigan",3

A number of stairs both up and down but not too strenuous if healthy and moderate conditioning. Good tour guides and the right length. There are less tours available mid-week vs the weekend. Not sure I would take a different one in addition unless you wanted to do more caver type tours on hands and knees. Very nice hiking trails and picnic areas close to visitor center. The food available at the park is limited as is the variety of mostly chain restaurants at Cave City which is 10 miles away. Can't see myself staying more than a couple of days here but was worth seeing. Stayed at the Woodland Cottages at the park which was very reasonably priced and close to a number of trails.Simple rustic cottages with no air conditioning but convenient to visitor center/tours.

Mammoth Cave,"We were overachievers and done two tours - the historic tout and the domes and dripstones tour. Both great and different.Historic tour - easier to walk, our tour group was pretty large - at least 50 people (a school field trip group was among them) and two tour guides. It was cold but not overwhelming, I had flats w/out socks and I was OK but long sleeve shirt is a must. There are stairs and we walked over 2 miles. Make sure you are OK to walk in a dimmed lights.Domes and dripstones tour is a bit more advanced - a vertical staircase, a lot of ducking and sometimes squeezing through tight passages. It was bit advanced but fun. Also probably 2 hours. This tour was smaller in the size of the group, with only one guide. You get on a school bus to get to the entrance of this cave system - takes ~ 10 minutes each way.All tour guides were very knowledgable and managed the crowds well.There is a restaurant in an hotel across a small creek that serves hot dogs type of food and drinks. It was reasonably priced and good. The staff was very nice - we had a very little time between out two tours and they made sure we got our order fast. Also, the restrooms were clean:-)!It could be a great visit for kids - 5 and up I think.Honestly, I am not sure if a wheelchair access is possible. It might if you have a fit group of friends but I didn't see an elevator and the stairs, especially in the Domes and dripstones tour would be almost impossible to manage. I am certain that the ticket office would recommend a tour that could work.I hope you will enjoy the caves as we did, it was a good visit for us.","June 12, 2015",A vast labyrinth of caves,24,"San Jose, California",4

Showers were far from campsite, closed at 9am and only took tokens. The campsites are nice, but no electricity.The main attraction of the park is obviously the caves. We took the historic tour. It is was a ton of walking (2 miles and 350 feet of stairs), but it covered the basics. All of us wished there was more information, but I suppose we saw the highlights. If you cannot walk 2 miles above ground, you will hate 2 miles in a cave. Stairs are all very solid, but there are hundreds of them.

Mammoth Cave,"We went on the History tour. The ranger guides were very informative and passionate about the cave. The cave has been used for several purposes over the last 150 years and it shows the use, which I guess is its history. The cave itself is some what plain lacking the usual cave formations. It is dimly lit. As others have said it is a long walk with a long stair climb at the end, which could be tiring to some.

Mammoth Cave,"We stayed overnight at the hotel and did the Historic and Domes and Dripstones tours. I am torn on recommending doing both of them, especially in the same day. We are a fairly active and healthy family and we were pretty beat after the tours. There are LOTS of steps. The visitor center has a nice walk through exhibit with lots of information on the caves, ecology, geology and history of the area. There are 15 or so phones where you can listen to more information.There is also a gift shop as well as a separate shop that sells mostly wearables - tees, hats, etc.We did the Historic Tour first. Our guide, Chris, was really great. He held our children's interest and made the tour more enjoyable. There are many areas (most areas) where we would walk through in single file, then we would gather in a large area and Chris would speak a little about what we saw. We happened to be near the front of the group so we could hear what Chris was saying as we walked though the more narrow parts. If hearing those extra tidbits of information is important to you, then be sure to try to stay up front. Or in back as there is another Ranger bringing up the rear. I would definitely recommend this tour. One other thing on this one. We wore long jeans and brought jackets. I was starting to feel silly as we waiting at the pavilion for the tour to start. However, as soon as we got to the cave entrance I was sooo glad that I had a jacket!I'm torn on the Domes nad Dripstones Tour. #1 the first 80-85% is just like the Historic Tour. Same basic history and looks the same. Only towards the end do you get the stalactite/stalagmite and waterfall rock formations. Maybe it was because I was tired by then, but I did have the thought that I could have done without that tour. However, my husband totally felt it was worth it. Also on this tour, we were stuck in the middle so we had to kind of figure out what we were looking at on our own. (This one had lots of the single file areas, too.) Another thing to note. The D & D Tour was much better lighted, so we were able to get good photos, even without a flash. ","June 9, 2015",Great experience for whole family.,1,"Atlanta, Georgia",5
Mammoth Cave,Best experience my children have had! Our tour guides for both were so knowledgeable and passionate about what they do. We stayed up front with both in order to hear better and found that you can take better pictures that way. There are so many tidbits of info they have that you'll miss if you aren't in the front and there wasn't any rush like the tourists toward the back felt. Thank you to all the guides and bus drivers for making this a memorable vacation for my family!,"June 9, 2015",Historic & Domes and Dripstones Tours,10,"Burlington, Kentucky",5
Mammoth Cave,My son is a cave lover and we've been to several. This was our first visit to s national park. Cave tour was inexpensive and good length for the historic tour. Unique cave due to the Rangers and dry cave experience was more rugged and the tour group was nice. Kind of slim pickings around but worth a visit if simply for the been there done that. ,"June 9, 2015",Unique and fun ,87,,4

Mammoth Cave,"Our family took a day trip to Mammoth Caves National Park, KY. We visited the website ahead of time and chose to take the Historical Tour. (When we arrived at the main entrance, a park ranger was greeting people, handing out maps, and describing the tours that were available.) Try to be flexible -- the first tour time we wanted was already sold out when we arrived...Tickets for our family of 4 were $51.We had about an hour to wait for our tour time and visited the indoor exhibits that described how Mammoth Caves were formed, found, and used. This exhibit is very nicely done. It is modern and clearly layed out.My eight year old son was very interested in the informaion. He stopped to read everything and loved the narrated stories at the telephones. My teenager walked through the exhibit ahead of us and seemed a little bored with the exhibit. My husband, eight year old son, and I stopped to watch a short video, narrated by Mike Rowe, that talked about the caves. If you have a chance to walk through the exhibit, make sure to stop and watch the video. It tells a lot about the history and gives some information not found anywhere else.We met outside at the designated pavilion about 10 minutes before our tour started. Our tour was guided by two park rangers (one at the front who narrated and one at the back to make sure everyone stayed together.) Our guides today were Keven, at the front, and John, at the back (today was John's last day as he has transfered to another cavern.)Keven was both humorous and very informative. He told us a lot about the history of the caverns before we started. At several locations during the tour, he stopped and talked about what we were going to see as well as the history of how the caverns were discovered.) He made the tour feel very personal and was a great guide! Be prepared! The tour guide clearly informed us that we would be required to walk up 188 stairs on the ascent of the tour. Please note: the 188 stairs DO NOT include all of the ascent. Once at Mammoth Hall (the bottom of the tour), you must go up (walking and taking stairs) to the level of a set of steel stairs the park installed. These steel stairs are a continuous ascent of 188 stairs!!) This number also DOES NOT include the tall set of stairs that are at the entrance to the caverns. Our legs were all hurting when we got to the outside!!The pace is fairly brisk. I recommend that you try to stay at the front of the group. As the tour goes on, it is easy to fall behind -- especially with families of very young children or with large family groups. (We almost missed one of the tour guides commentaries after we got behind a large family group.)Wear good shoes with thick soles. Even with good gripper shoes, the floor is very rough in some spots. You will feel all of the bumps, especially if you choose to wear thin sandals or flip flops. A few places are a little slick, too. It was a pretty dry day for us -- and we still had a couple of places with slick flooring.Closed-toed shoes are recommended. There is a fungus found in the caves that kills bats. When you leave the cave, you must walk on a soapy mat to clean off your shoes -- no exceptions -- and people with sandals or open toed shoes will get their feet wet!Walk conscientiously with your eyes on the ground. Some of the paths are paved and level while others are the actual cavern floor. We saw several people looking up and trying to walk who had to catch themselves when they took a step wrong or didn't see a low spot on the floor. If you want to look around, I suggest that you stop walking for just a second to be safe.There are no bathrooms in the cavern. Be sure to stop at the visitor's center before you go. This tour lasted a full 2 hours. You are allowed to take water with you -- if you tend to get overheated or thirsty, take a bottle of water with you. Also, the visitor's center has a FREE location near the restrooms to refill your water bottle with filtered water.Strollers are not allowed. If you are claustrophobic or have difficulty walking, I DO NOT recommend the historic tour. Some places get very narrow or low (you have to bend over to get through the opening). The lighting could be better in some spots, too.Several locations have aluminum hand rails. If the rails are there, USE THEM! They will save you from a steep ascent/descent or fall! In some spots, the handrails were wet and slick.Some people took jackets with them to the cavern. The caves were nice and cool. With the pace of the tour, no one in my family complained about being too cold. (There are cave vents near the entrance and exit that are cool, but they only last just a minute.)There are two gift shop areas in the visitor's center. One focuses mainly on tshirts and apparel (it is an open area at the back of the ranger info center) while the other is a room at the front of the building. There is a nice selection of books, children's gifts, and more.) If you child has a National Parks Passport, don't forget to get his/her book stamped here!This was a great trip that my family will talk about for some time. It can easily be done within one day. Allow yourself 3-4 hours from time of arrival, walking through the exhibit, and tour time (if your tour is shorter, you can adjust this amount.)We did not visit the adjoining lodge, but there is a place to stay on the property. The park rangers also announced that there were kennels at the lodge for animals who accompanied families to the park (they are not allowed on the tour.)","June 7, 2015",Great Outdoor Adventure -- Be Prepared For Walking!,92,"Murfreesboro, Tennessee",5
Mammoth Cave,"I visited Mammoth Cave as a child so it was a pleasure to finally take my son for a visit. Our family took the Historic Tour as well as the Domes and Dripstones Tour. Lots of walking but nothing an able-bodied person can't do. Despite our guides differing presentation styles, we enjoyed both of them. The cave doesn't have much in the way of fantastic formations. (The little there is we saw on the second tour.) But the human and geological history of the cave is interesting. We had hoped to take the long tour that includes the Snowball Room but that tour is not being offered right now since the elevator is broken. Spending an afternoon here was well worth it.","June 7, 2015",History Galore!,34,"Savannah, Georgia",5
Mammoth Cave,"There are so many different tours of the caves to choose from but you need to purchase them ahead of time if you want to guarantee they will be available. We tried to get ours about a week before and they were already sold out for the Frozen tour. We ended up doing the discovery tour which is self guided and about $5 per person (less for kids). They start selling tickets at 8 when the visitor center opened but the discovery tour didn't start until 10! The kids (3,6,8) enjoyed it but we're cold in the caves so I strongly suggest bringing a coat and pants. You can go through the discovery tour in as little as 15 min if you just walk around and don't stop to listen to the Rangers. Overall we enjoyed it but I don't know if I would make a special trip back to this park. Glad we did it once though. ","June 6, 2015",Lots of tours to choose from,60,Illinois,4
Mammoth Cave,"Must be experienced at least once on the underground tours. Guides make the walking/hike even better. Over 400 miles of trails so much room for more tours to be developed.

Mammoth Cave,Stopped at Mammoth Cave after a night at the Grand Ole Opry. It's only an hour and a half from Nashville. The tour I took was two hours and our ranger Bob was very knowledgeable.

Mammoth Cave,"Have wanted to stop here since I was a child----back in the 60's. So worth taking the time for the 2 hour tour and so worth the price. We had a great tour guide and gleaned a lot of information. Do not take children young enough to cry and be disruptive--it really made it hard to hear the guide as the group was fairly large and the crying child dominated the sound factor in the cave. It really caused us to miss out on some of the commentary. The grade inside the cave isn't bad for walking but there are a LOT of steps. They warn you in advance but seriously take this to heart if walking pretty much non-stop for two hours and climbing zillions of steps could be a challenge for you.Ceilings are high for the most part--only a short bit where tall people had to walk bent in half. I was worried about claustrophobia before going in, but because most of the ceilings were tall enough or trail was wide enough I never felt hemmed in or panicked.","June 4, 2015",Mammothly Impressive,38,"Dallas, Texas",5
Mammoth Cave,"Our family of 5 (kids - 10,12,14) spent the day here last Sunday (May 31). We loved it! We did the Domes and Dripstones tour at 11:15 (was close to full tour). It starts with a NARROW winding staircase down into the cave - VERY cool but tight in some spaces. Overall an amazing tour of tunnels, open areas and structures. Very little talk from the guides which I missed from tours we have done other places - but with the size of the tour it would be hard to narrate during the entire tour. We had a 30 min break between tours and ate a picnic lunch on a blanket outside the center. Then at 1:45 started the Historic tour. Here there were just as many people but was a bit better narrated. Great guides both times!! Jacob and Kevin were fantastic!! Our kids (our oldest is a bit claustrophobic so for his sake might have been better to do the historic first then the domes) LOVED every minute of the day! And the tours went by fast! Would go back to do again or try other tours!","June 4, 2015",LOVED our day here!!,59,"Evansville, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave's claim to fame is the sheer magnitude of the cave structure - it is the longest known cave system. The park offers several different tours that explore various parts of the cave, sometimes overlapping sites. I chose the Domes and Dripstones Tour. We rode a bus to a manmade entrance about a mile from the visitor center, then embarked on a two-hour tour. The cave was impressive, however, I was slightly disappointed. The majority of that area of the cave is ""dead""- as in, there is no groundwater seeping in to create stalactites and stalagmites. There are some very impressive stalagmites at the end of the tour, however. During the walk, we were given an interesting history lesson of various explorers, and were able to see fault lines and enormous boulders that had fallen thousands of years previous. When I ended the tour, I took a short trail to the original entrance (on the Heritage Walk Trail). Visitors without a tour ticket can go a short ways in down and through the entrance, which is really quite stunning . I also walked farther along the trail to the River Styx and an old boat landing. My time was short, or I would have spent more time in the woods, but there is much to see outside, as well as in the visitor center. There is also a lodge on the premises for those wishing to stay longer.","June 3, 2015",A Sight to See,50,"Bremerton, Washington",4

Mammoth Cave,"On vacation recently we were passing near Mammoth Cave and decided to spend some time and take a tour. I am partially disabled and, after checking the difficulty of the various cave tours, I found that the only one I could handle was the Frozen Niagara Tour. It is only offered twice a day, 9:15 and 4:15 and we missed the earlier one. We got our tickets for the later one then did some shopping before returning to the visitor's center.Our park ranger guide was friendly and informative and did a great job. However, I was a bit disappointed with the tour itself. It was only a little over an hour long and while it went through the purportedly most decorated portion of the cave, those decorations proved to be rather sparse. We've been to Carlsbad Caverns and they are so spectacular that Mammoth simply doesn't compare to them or other caves we've toured. The ""frozen Niagara"" proved to be a large, beautiful flowstone feature, but you had to descend a long, steep stairway to see it and I was one of the ones who could not do this, so I stayed at the top with some others and chatted until the group came back up. We then were led out the same we came in. Be aware, if you go, that some of the ups and downs on this easy trail are slick and there are tight squeezes and low passages to navigate. No bathroom facilities once you leave the visitor's center and, while some couples had small children, I really wouldn't recommend the cave to kids under about 8-10.Frankly, I was expecting more. The park itself is heavily wooded and we were delighted to see nearly two dozen wild turkeys and a number of deer, but I don't think we'll visit again. I'll just add this to the ""been there, done that"" category on my bucket list. Maybe the longer, more strenuous tours are better, but I'll never know.","June 2, 2015",Impressive but not Carlsbad Caverns,47,"Dallas, Texas",3
Mammoth Cave,"Great tour of the cave. Be sure to start in the visitors center with the movie and displays, so much more informative that way. Tour guides were fun, total hams, silly jokes.

Mammoth Cave,"We went here on our way back from the Smokies last year. While I was disappointed by the smokies, I was pleasantly surprised at Mammoth Cave. The park is small and easy to miss, but worth the visit if you're in the area. I suggest doing a variety of the cave tours. We did the Historic Tour, Domes and Dripstones, and one of the Latern Tours. All of them were great. The tour guides were engaging and very informative. This cave is huge and has a lot of history. If you want to see typical cave formations, do the Domes and Dripstones, because you won't find many stalactites and stalagmites going through anything that starts in the natural entrance - those tours are more for history buffs. When we got there and got our tickets, we had about an hour to kill before our first tour, so we went to hike to a grotto where a creek fed the underground river in the cave. We got turned around trying to find the correct path and a ranger actually showed us a nice shortcut that only the Rangers use. Very nice and helpful. Walking down there was a nice stroll. The grotto was interesting to see, but what was even better was the 5 foot long black snake that darted out in front of us. Really cool, but my wife freaked out. At any rate, it was a great little park to visit and definitely worth a day trip.","May 31, 2015","Big Cave, Great Tours",12,,4
Mammoth Cave,"We arrived mid afternoon, and the only available tour was the Domes and Dripstone tour at 3:45pm. Though it was a two hour tour, and we'd already had a pretty full day, we elected to go. We had our 7 year old grand daughter with us, and she had a blast. Thomas was our guide, and he was very informative and passionate about his work. The tour itself started out by descending several steep and narrow steps. Most of the tour was a dry cave, void of formations you will see in a wet cave. However, the tour ends with the Frozen Niagara, which is wet, and has some beautiful formations. On the short bus ride over and back, we saw several deer and turkeys along the road. The visitor center is very nice, and has a great exhibit offering lots of information about the cave.We ate lunch at the restaurant the following day, and I do not recommend that. Their food was very cafeteria like. Not fresh, or tasty.","May 30, 2015",Domes and Dripstones...,99,Indiana,4
Mammoth Cave,"Over a busy Memorial Day weekend, our options were a bit limited in the tours available. We ended up taking the historic tour, which was hosted by park ranger John Davis. Mr. Davis is a terrific, A+ guide - able to answer any question and in total control of the tour group, and easily the best guide we have ever had on a national park tour.One oddity of the area we toured were the lack of stalactites and stalagmites - due to the lack of water in that section of the cave. Mammoth is an understatement though - this cave system has hundreds of miles of caves, many still unexplored. You can take tours that vary from 2 hours to even even 4 or 5 hours - some really challenging tours can be taken if you are up for it. The visitor center and adjoining hotel were quite nice, but the dining area we ate it seemed completely overwhelmed by the number of guests - every time a tour left off (and there are several different types of tours) they would get flooded with hungry spelunkers. There are numerous trails in the area, but it wasn't too much different from hiking at home - pleasant.","May 30, 2015",Impressive Cave system with great tours,38,"Lawrenceville, New Jersey",4
Mammoth Cave,We visited on a very nice day in May when it was warm and sunny but not oppressively so. We went to two 2 hour tours. They were Domes and Dripstones and the Historic tour. According to my wife's fit bit we walked 45 flights of stairs and 5 miles. Before going she had some concerns if her knee would hold up but all was good. The majority of the stairs are metal and have handrails so navigating around wasn't a problem. We arrived there an hour early as the time zone is different than Louisville where were staying - this doesn't make much sense geographically but we had to blow an hour before the tours started which was kind of aggravating. Still the tours where worth it. The cost of the tours is negligible for what you get as an experience.,"May 29, 2015",Great National Park,57,"Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, USA",5
Mammoth Cave,"We were lucky and called ahead because even in the off season the cave does get very busy and tours can be booked. The historic entrance was discovered in 1799 by a bear hunter. The entrance was beautiful as we walked down the stairs. Once inside the cave I noticed the lighting was dim and the temp was near 54 degrees but the the sights and history the guide provided our group with was amazing. Mammoth Cave is the world's longest network of cavern corridors stretching over 330 miles long. The cave offers colorful onyx flowstone, views of stalactites, stalagmites, columns, huge rooms and pits and domes. Sinkholes allowed water to enter making vertical shafts which joined the underground rivers. During the war of 1812 saltpeter vats were mined in Mammoth Cave and converted into gun powder. At this location Edwin Booth stood on a limestone stage and recited from Hamlet to a group of cave visitors in 1872 the area became known as Booth's Amphitheater. Years ago guides encouraged visitors to erect stone monuments on Gothic Ave. as a way to mark the states they were from. They also wrote on the ceiling with candle smoke. Today the National Park Service will not allow this practice but you can still see writings on the ceiling/walls in one area. The most beautiful part of the cave was the Frozen Niagara, the subterranean was 75ft high and 50 ft wide.From the lower part of the cave we exited through the cave's largest natural entrance after climbing a huge series of metal stairs looking down over an impressive view of the vertical shafts. This was a wonderful cave tour, one of the best I've been on and I do enjoy seeing and taking cave tours. This cave did have a very narrow area called ""Fat Man's Misery"" where I am not sure everyone would be able to get through. This is a must see in this area. Once out of the cave we enjoyed looking at the museum and gift shop. Then we drove all around the park stopping at the Green River and hiking awhile. We saw where the ferry traveled but did not have time to ride. The entire park was beautiful even in December.","May 29, 2015","Mammoth Cave National Park Historic, Domes and Dripstones and Frozen Niagara Tours",22,Ashland,5
Mammoth Cave,"This 2 hour tour was very informative and well handled. However, at one point when the group had stopped for a dialogue by the guide, I was a bit tired of standing so sat down on one of the rocks by the path. One of the tour guides said, ""Don't sit on the rock"". ...SERIOUSLY??? I can understand why guests cannot be permitted to leave the path, climb on the rocks, etc. but cannot see how 1-2 people sitting on a rock will damage anything.

And when I say a group, I mean there were over 100 students that were loud, noisy and very rude. Had we of known that there was going to be so many students on the tour we would have opted for another tour. I feel like I was cheated out of an experience because of some students. I am a teacher myself so I understand what it is like to take a group of students on a field trip but they should have had their own tour away from the general public.

Mammoth Cave,"I have taken a breath and counted to ten before I started to write this review.I was with a group of eight and we all left the Park with the same feeling which was our tour was a bad experience. It was the worst National Park experience for me....ever.The facts are this. We took the Historic Tour at 9:00AM on Saturday, May 23rd. (Memorial Day weekend.) There were 130+ people in our group according to one of the Rangers. There were two Rangers. One lead and the other brought up the rear. The guy in the rear was ""Chris"" and part of the reason we were so disappointed.But first, the Cave itself is huge.....and that is the one thing you can count on. Do not expect to see anything similar to Carlsbad Caverns that is so well lighted or even the more local Carter Caves in Olive Hill Kentucky. Mammoth is much more Rustic and not as developed for visitors.On the HistoricTour, you do not see any formations to speak of except for some Flow Stone towards the end. It is mostly a dimly lit cave of rock walls, dried silt and mud and lots of rubble from fallen rocks. There are signs of people using the cave for various reasons over the years. They have carried in wood and steel to be used for whatever purpose. It was hard to see much as the Rangers pace was frantic.The lead Ranger would walk briskly to a point where he would stop, wait a couple of minutes then start talking about that particular point of interest. The problem was he was finished talking before the last people in the group got to him. Everyone got so strung out that the accordion effect would take several minutes to collapse back into a group.Ranger Chris has a tough job and is probably not the right guy for the job. He brought up the rear and would catch people stepping off the trail to snap a group photo. On one such occasion, I overheard what he said to the 5 or 6 people breaking the rules. He told them he was going to personally lead them out of the Cave. His voice was gruff and he was attempting to sound threatening. I fear he will speak that way to the wrong person someday and will end up being carried out on a stretcher. He lacks diplomacy and charisma. My wife commented to him towards the end of the tour that she felt like we were ""herded"" through the cave. His response was ""well, you can't please everyone.""A lot of the problem is the size of the group. I know we felt rushed and even so, another ""Historic Tour"" caught up with us near the end.The description of the tour did not adequately prepare me for the experience. If you have a small child then chances are you will struggle in some of the areas where a few people had to crawl due to downward steps and a very low ceiling. This area caused the group to get strung out and several young people ran to catch up. The walkway is dimly lit in many areas and the transition from developed walkway to dirt floor has no lighting in many places. I saw two people fall and I nearly went down once.I love Caves and our National Parks. In my opinion, the park needs to spend a ton of money so as to better light the Cave and improve the guests experience. The walkways are not well lit, poorly marked and you are forced to move quickly which makes for a dangerous scenario.","May 26, 2015",My expectations were too high.,88,"Townsend, Tennessee",2
Mammoth Cave,"Our group of eight travelers joined about 60 others at the assembly point. This park is very large as is the cave itself. We had two park rangers who accompanied us, one giving lengthy stories and instruction, while the other remained at the end of our group to be sure we did not lose anyone and to keep a sharp eye out for anyone who strayed off the assigned path. As an experienced cave explorer and visitor, I found this particular tour to be underwhelming. There were no typical formations and the lighting was primitive by commercial cave standards. Also our tour was not friendly to older or very young people. The path varied from metal steps to ceramic tiles and finally rough stone areas. We had a few very young children along who screamed and appeared to be traumatized the entire time. Our group was way too big for everyone to hear the lengthy talks frequently given by our lead guide. Lastly, it was not clear that we would have to climb over two hundred steps at the end. I gather that most of the other tours are much more traditional and interesting.","May 26, 2015","Although a huge park and cave, the Historic Tour will disappoint anyone who has been to several other large caves",34,"Oak Ridge, Tennessee",3
Mammoth Cave,"I was very disappointed in the Mammoth Caves and the ""historic"" tour we took. Our tour was made up of about 80 people and we could not hear the guide most of the time so we learned very little about the cave itself. There were also so many of us that it took forever to get from chamber to chamber. I would only recommend to those who enjoy packed attraction tours.","May 26, 2015",Nothing to write home about,29,"Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar",2
Mammoth Cave,We had a blast on the Mammoth Cave Tours - we did the Historic Tour and Domes and Dripstones. Perfect length for a younger family. Guides were awesome and made it fun. What was a big bummer was the parents who brought a 1 year old on the Historic Tour. The baby cried during the rangers entire presentation and no one heard a thing. It couldn't have been much fun for the parents carrying that kid through all the twists and turns and dangerous footing.

It's amazing that the caves are so expansive with so many different types of formations to see. We went on the Historic Tour first and the Domes and Dripstones tour later in the day. Bring a long-sleeved shirt or sweatshirt as it's cool inside. I brought a headlamp, which enabled me to look longer at features that I was interested in.

Definitely bring a sweatshirt for the caves -- it's chilly down there! Also, I recommend talking to the rangers about the differences between the tours before you buy a ticket.

Mammoth Cave,"After moving to Kentucky two years ago, Mammoth Caves has been on our ""state exploration"" bucket list. We have experienced a majority of our national parks~even climbing Mount Rainier, so experiencing a national park in our state was a must.One thing that specifically attracted us to this park other than the caves themselves, was the large number of hiking trails. We LOVE to hike and wanted to add Mammoth Caves to our hiking experience. The hiking experience is what led to me rating Mammoth Caves ""average"".We stayed in Cave City at the Sleep Inn based on Trip Advisor reviews. This was five miles from the entrance and actually the closest place to stay unless you were interested in staying at a hotel straight out of the movie ""Deliverance"". Cave City was very interesting in that it looked like it had once tried real hard to make a go of it being outside a national treasure, but failed. The route into the park was run down and worn. Not a great first impression~but this was not the actual downtown, so that may have been better.There are many tours to choose from. Read the reviews first~some are better than others. We went on the Domes and Dripstones and loved it. It was everything you thought the inside of a cave should look like~very true to the pictures.Our guide was fabulous and funny, and being there off season, our group only had 14 people in it. Some of the cut offs for group size go into the 100 range. I couldn't begin to be on such a tour with a hundred people. The two year old crying baby on our tour was just about enough. Keep in mind that if you are a senior, rates are cut in half. There are also about 8 miles of trails directly around the visitor center and these were good for the every day hiker. We were interested in the back country hikes and very terribly disappointed.There is a bit of a drive to any of the back country hiking. The issue was that a good majority of the hikes were equestrian shared~so we never felt like we were hiking in the woods, but rather walking down a road. We headed out to a hike that was 8 miles round trip that was allegedly a ridge, but we never left the forest floor. About three miles into the hike, we simply turned around. No sense keeping at something you love to do when you don't love anything about it. We booked our hotel to stay another day to hike further, but decided not to waste our time. Instead we headed out and went to Buffalo Trace Distillery :) In short, I do not recommend Mammoth Caves as a hiking destination.There are many places we have visited that we thought might be fun to return to at some point~this is not one of them. We do have a voucher for a canceled tour from the past so will return for that tour. This time we will go in the fall. At least the changing seasons might add to what little scenery there was.","May 16, 2015",Was hoping for a bit more~,92,"Newport, Kentucky",3

However, don't try and compare this cave system to the grandness breath taking views of the western parks. For what it is, the cave is massive with some fascinating history.

Mammoth Cave,"We did the basic Historic tour (2 hrs) and really enjoyed it. Joe was our guide and he was very professional, kept the school children in line while also respecting them and their questions, and was very informative. He's probably one of the best rangers we've met and we've been to 37 National Parks. The tour is dimly lit (no cheesy multi-color shows here), so wear comfortable and stable shoes. This cave is known for being the longest in the world and because of that natural wonder it is not the type of cave where you see hundreds of stalagmites and stalactites. So don't expect that and be disappointed. Rather, enjoy this cave for the wonder it is - best part is 'Fat Man's Misery', a narrow section of the cave you get to maneuver through. Great for all ages.

It is hard to take pictures because you are not allowed to use flash but it you take a picture with one of the lights in the background, it turns out pretty well and you can always brighten them with a computer program.

Mammoth Cave,"This has to be one of the worst national parks that I've been to. First of all the caves are so dimly lighted that you can't even see what you are looking at. My daughter and service dog accompanied me on this trip which was supposed to be a fun time but turned not fun in seconds. We were led into the caves by two park ranger guides. The female guide Mary, who in my opinion didn't have very good people skills and was lacking a sense of humor. After about two hours into the caves my Service Dog had to poop and as they say ""poop happens"" I asked the male ranger for a bag to clean up after my service dog. He said not to worry about it and he would clean it up for me. So I continued on the tour. About 10 minutes later he approached me with a Ziploc bag full of dog poop and told me to throw it away on my way out. So upon reaching the top of the stairs on the way out of the cave I was looking for the trashcan to throw away my doggy poo when behind me I hear someone screaming at me to stop! Stop! And once again to stop!As I turned around to see what the commotion was about it was Ranger Mary screaming at me at the top of her voice. I replied I have a bag full of poop and I'm throwing it away as I was instructed, do you mind? She replied ""I'll call law-enforcement on you!"" "" You need to get back over there and wipe your feet!"" At this same moment my daughter spoke up to let Ranger Mary know that I was just doing what I was told to do. Ranger Mary then snapped and began to be rude to my daughter. So we immediately left the park probably never to return.","May 6, 2015",Ranger/ cave guide Mary,7,HARBOR BEACH,1

But we were please overall with the experience. Rangers are always great, enlightening, well-informed. Out two cave tours (4 miles total) were fabulous. The tour prices were, as usual, extremely reasonable in price and solid in detail and opportunity to learn. I don't think the American people will ever understand how lucky we are to have such great parks and people staffing them. We are the envy of the world in this.

I would've missed that one stalactite, too, if it wasn't for the tour guide shining her flashlight on it. Mammoth Cave is a very bland-looking cave. It is essentially featureless. It looks more like a man-made mine than a natural cave. As one person commented on the tour, ""it looks like you're walking into a big void.""

The tour guide was very excited because this rarely happens. The waterfalls inside the cave were really flowing! I hiked outside before the tour - I walked down to the Green River on a nice trail.

The only problem I had was I couldn't hear our tour guide all the time (I loved him, he was hilarious!) The website says that the tour capacity is 120, and I assume that since it was sold out there were 120 of us there, sometimes he'd start talking before we all got within hearing range, so I feel I missed some information.

Although it was a large group I never had trouble hearing the ranger either, but I tended to stay near the front. The inside of the cave is huge. Many areas are very wide. It almost feels like you are walking thru a mine instead of a cave made by nature. This tour is mostly dry rock, not a whole lot of drippy wet cave. The coolest areas are deep crevices that look like they go down forever. Wear comfy shoes with grippy soles like hiking boots or running shoes, as the tour is 2 hours. And it's cold in there so dress like it's november. Bring a flashlight to see areas that arent well lit, especially some uneven ground when walking, but turn it off when the ranger is speaking. You may want to wear a hood since you will get dripped on a few times. And a water bottle is a good idea. When we entered the cave it was hot and sunny but when we exited it was pouring rain so be prepared, and the hike up the hill to the visitors center feels much longer after 2 hours in the cave.","April 8, 2015",an underground adventure,32,"Taylor Mill, Kentucky",5

Both the tours were fully booked (120 people/tour), but it does not affect individual experience as the rangers will gather you all at intermediate stops and share the history and stories.

It will not be fun for you or anyone else on the tour. We went during heavy rain and that increased the wetness and the interest in the caves. It was a fantastic experience.,"April 8, 2015",Fantastic Cave Tour- Domes and Dripstones,34,"Toledo, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"I was excited to be able to visit a UNESCO World Heritage Site while traveling in Kentucky. Mammoth Cave National Park was inscribed in 1981 (http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/150). This visit was impromptu, a stop on my way back to Louisville from Franklin, and I was not dressed appropriately nor did I have the appropriate shoes. I was able to join the 1:30 p.m. “Domes and Dripstones” tour for $14.00. From the Visitor Center back parking lot, we boarded a reconditioned school bus for a short ride to the cave entrance. The bus dropped us off at the top of a large sinkhole and the rangers gave us a brief orientation of the tour. There are stairs leading to the door of the cave entrance, the first of many, many stairs throughout the tour. It was dark and dank, and sometimes wet, inside the cave. The steel stair steps were covered so they were not as slippery as they could have been. The cave’s floor is uneven and it was a challenge if you were not wearing shoes with good tractions (like I was). A handheld flashlight would have helped as I navigated through dimly-lit passages. The tour lasted two hours and the park rangers were informative and managed the group well. I was disappointed to learn they no longer do boat tours inside the cave (those are outdated photos on the World Heritage Site listing), because the wood in the boats were harmful to an endangered species of shrimp. Needless to say, it was a fun tour and I enjoyed the visit. At the end of the tour, when we were offloaded from the bus back at the Visitor Center, we were required to wipe our shoes on bio-security maps to avoid spreading the White Nose Syndrome affecting bats to other areas. One can easily spend many hours at Mammoth Caves National Park, but I had to return to Louisville so I left right after the tour. Mammoth Caves National Park is on Central Time, so I was an hour behind Eastern Time already. Enjoy your visit!","April 7, 2015",UNESCO World Heritage Site in KY,376,"Oxon Hill, Maryland",5
Mammoth Cave,"There are nearly a dozen different tours available, especially on weekends. The guide you get is the luck of the draw. At 120 the Historic Tour was at least 4 times too big and that family should emphatically not been allowed to bring a baby along. Book your tour in advance and go prepared for the conditions below ground--read and observe all the cautions. No flash photography. At 400 miles and counting this is the longest cave system on Earth. That does not make it the most stunning or geologically significant. Stairs-350.","April 7, 2015",Select a tour with a small group,156,"Oakville, Canada",3

I highly recommend visiting if you have time.","April 6, 2015",Great Experience,5,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"We went in the early afternoon on Good Friday during spring break, so it wasn't surprising to find that all guided tours were full. We took the self guided discovery tour which is always available (and much cheaper, at $13.00 for a family of four). It turns out this was probably best because our kids (particularly the six year old) would have had trouble enjoying a longer tour. In this tour, they got to run from spot to spot, hearing the few guides positioned throughout the cave, sharing its history. I had taken the tour as a child and remembered other parts of the cave, so I was a bit disappointed that I wasn't able to see them. However, having happy kids was probably more important to my enjoyment of the cave this time around. The park is gorgeous as well, with tiny streams trickling down the mossy rocks of the ravine. The kids saw another child wearing a gold plastic badge and asked about it at the information booth. The park has a fun program for the kids to complete an age based number of workbook exercises about conservation and cave history to become a Junior Ranger, complete with oath, certificate, and badge. This, my children will always remember, and they learned about conservation from the many exhibits in the visitor center!","April 6, 2015","We did the Discovery self guided tour, which was just right for our young kids.",37,MN,5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave National Park – Oh Mammoth Yes!This was the last stop of our week long Spring Break. We arrived in the afternoon had dinner and off to explore the grounds. We did stay at the hotel and restaurant on the Parks’ grounds. We took the Domes and Dripstones tour the next day. Tour started out with a bus ride lasting a few minutes, in which we did see some wildlife. The tour itself was perfect for us; we are a family of 4 with 7 yrs. old twins. We only had 1 day here which was a big mistake, we would have enjoyed at least 2 days or more. Several types of tours and we plan on spending a few more days here next time, cave touring and exploring the park.","April 6, 2015",Oh Mammoth Yes!,32,"Kansas City, Missouri",5
Mammoth Cave,"I absolutely treasure our national park system. I have to say this prefacing the next statement. I have never wanted to leave a tour before this one. It certainly wasn't Mammoth cave's fault, but there was screaming children, super stinky people, awful loud and rude teenagers, etc. I implore people to discover our national parks for themselves, but don't go in the last history tour of the day on a holiday weekend. Even if you are Captain Procrastinator. If you want to actually hear the guide and not get man-handled in the dark by some stranger's children, reserve tickets for tours earlier in the day. On the flipside, I don't want this to discourage people from going. It was full of amazing history and a beautiful ecosystem of fauna nowhere else on the planet.

You get down and dirty and explore up to 6 miles of this awesome cave hiking, crawling, canyoning, belly crawling/sliding through all sorts of obstacles and formations. We covered hell hole, bare hole, man hole, double barrel shotgun, sewer pipe and no name. It was awesome. I recommend not bringing a pack with you. Be hydrated and be ready to get dirty.

Around 2pm and it was the last tour for the day, my daughter and I went on the tour. It was incredible to hear the history and what they found here and used during the civil war. Well worth the two hrs and mile and a half walk through part of the caves. The guides where friendly and always made sure everyone was ok. ","April 3, 2015",Great experience ,8,"Sydney, Australia",4
Mammoth Cave,"We took the 2 hr., 2 mi. Historic Tour. It was alright but I was expecting more. Maybe one of the other tours would have been better. True, there were huge caverns but most of the 2 miles was a nice walking path. Only a few narrow places (maybe 500 feet of narrows where you had to turn sideways and/or duck down). My idea of going through a cave is more like the Mammoth Onyx Cave (part of Kentucky Down Under - see my review on that).","April 3, 2015",Okay but did not meet expectations,72,"Plainfield, Indiana",3

Mammoth Cave,"So here is why I only gave three stars:Not that there is anything that can be changed to improve the National Park but what upset me about the Historic Tour was that you couldn't do it solo. The group we were with was way too big which made the experience tedious. Secondly, the historic tour just isn't that nice. It is simply just a big cave you can walk through. Yea, that's about it. I AM coming to Mammoth Cave after having just gone to Carlsbad Caverns. THAT, is a cave tour everyone must do!!! At Mammoth I found my self thinking that ""oh, this is just a big cave. Nothing too special"", whereas at Carlsbad I was in constant awe!I still am glad I saw Mammoth but I want to see the other tours.","April 2, 2015",Historic Tour,6,,3
Mammoth Cave,"I like caves. I like big ones, small ones. I've heard about Mammoth Cave my whole life so on a road trip where a visit only took us a little out of our way, we ventured to the cave. First, it's kind of difficult to figure out which tour to take. Some include other areas of the cave so you want your money's worth without spending hours rambling around. We chose one without many stalagmites or stalactites, but the timeframe, price and schedule fit our needs. It was two hours of worming our way through the caverns so if you're claustrophobic, this may present a problem. Now, NO ONE would describe me as athletic or exactly fit, but the brisk pace made this tour more of a workout than a visit. There was little time to stop and appreciate the formations. Even a very athletic looking young guy said the label of ""moderate activity"" misrepresented the effort. About half way through, the group is invited to sit down for about 15 minutes while the guide provides more stories. That helps. Obviously the cave is HUGE, but when you can only see a bit at one time, you can't experience that. It was fun, but more of a check-the-box experience than an I-can't-wait-to-come-back visit.","April 2, 2015","Cool, but overrated!",14,"Chicago, IL",4
Mammoth Cave,"The Frozen Niagara Tour is great if you have kids or seniors unable to take hundreds of stairs. You get to see beautiful parts of the cave and the Rangers give a wonderful history and information about Mammoth Cave. If you are up for a walk, down and up a hill then be sure to go see the Historical Entrance to the cave after your tour. *FYI - Mammoth Cave is on Central Time.","April 1, 2015",Family Friendly Mammoth Cave,9,"Bloomington-Normal, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"My family and I took a trip to Mammoth Cave during my 11 year old daughter's spring break. We haven't visited for 15 or so years, and we had forgotten how beautiful it is. We took the Historic and ""Domes and Dripstones"" tours which are both 2 hours. We took the Historic in the morning and Domes and Dripstones in the afternoon. The Domes and Dripstones includes the Frozen Niagara. Both tours are reasonably strenuous (about 10,000 steps each on my Fitbit) with lots of stairs. There are also some reasonably tight passages, especially on the Domes tour. If you are mildly claustrophobic or afraid of heights you should be OK, but you may want to reconsider if these types of situations bother you more than a little.We had great rangers on both tours who were very knowledgeable, and took plenty of questions. The only ""downside"" was that it was very crowded with school groups so it was a little noisy, but not too bad. The two recommendations I would make would be to book early as one of our tours filled up, and keep to the front of the group if you don't want to be running to catch up all the time (the rangers warn the group of this before departure). I also recommend hiking in the park as they have some great trails. For planning purposes, the four (two adults, two children) of us took two tours for $96, and we felt this was a reasonable price for two, two hour tours.We will certainly return at some point in the future as it's worth seeing multiple times. I certainly recommend it if you are looking for a different type of adventure.","April 1, 2015",Mammoth Cave Never Ceases to Amaze!,42,"Greencastle, Indiana",5

Mammoth Cave,We did this tour with our 10yr old. We all really liked it. I'm fairly fit but a plus size 6' woman. I was able to do the tour the hardest part was bending down in Tall Mans Agony. I would recommend this tour if you are reasonably fit and don't mind some tight spaces. I would recommend being at front if you want to go at a slower pace. I know it's contrary to logic but the front sets the pace and waits for the rear to catch up. My only complaint was the fact you had to keep moving at a steady pace at times making it difficult to see the beauty around ,"March 27, 2015",Historic tour really cool,17,"Naperville, Illinois",4

The staff never tired of my children's need to say things at random as children always do. Just nice folks. Ticket desk, gift shop, bus drivers, tour guides, and everyone else were just awesome.

Mammoth Cave,"We stayed in the area for two days on a trip to visit friends in Kentucky. This allowed us to do two of the Mammoth Cave tours - the Historic Tour and Domes and Dripstones the following day. Both of these tours are rated ""Moderate"" difficulty, which means you need to be in reasonable shape and probably not in the XXXL size range, but by no means super-fit.The Historic Tour starts at the old original entrance and explores some of the larger caverns and passageways across 4 different levels of the cave. Domes and Dripstones enters via a man made entrance and immediately descends several hundred feet down a sinkhole. Both tours were fascinating, but Domes and Dripstones gets the nod from me as being the better of the two. The tighter passageways means it feels a bit more ""cave explorer"" and the way the water has eroded and formed various rock formations is just stunning. Both tours had friendly and knowledgable ranger guides.If you need to pass some time waiting for your tour there are some short hiking trails down to the Green River and River Styx Spring. These are helpful as they also allow you to appreciate the geography of the area and the layered rock formations which allowed the caves to form.","March 25, 2015",Simply Magnificent,35,"Hitchin, United Kingdom",5
Mammoth Cave,"We stayed here several days, camped and took in the caves. If you have small children be prepared to carry them as some of the stairs are steep and very long. We took in more than one tour and some are miles so be prepared to be sore the next day but it is well worth it. The longest one I took was the Avenues.The raccoon's are great fun. The first night they got into the cooler and ate all our food so the next night we put a huge rock on the cooler. They pushed the rock off and again ate all our food. We put the cooler in the car and got up the next morning to a raccoon hanging over the top of the car trying to figure a way into the car. I even had one take a can of coffee down the trail and try to chew through the metal.

It was a rainy day when we went, but it only added to the experience, walking down the flights of stairs getting dripped on by the falling rain. Definitely bring comfortable shoes, and make sure they have a good grip incase of rain. There are some tight squeezes as you're going down into the cave, but my 6' 2"" boyfriend was fine, and we even had a small backpack.

Hotel not a grand one...orig. burned down early 1900's. we arrived early for our reservation..checked to see if we could switch out our tour ticket times to earlier time...$3 charge per ticket to cancel. not worth it. so spent alot of time checking out their history rooms (nice hands on but phones to hear the info out of date), gift shops, nice bathrooms, checked out hotel, got some coffee and snacks. main restaurant not inviting enough to stay for a meal.","March 20, 2015",Historic tour,133,"New Port Richey, FL",4

Mammoth Cave,"Most people think of Kentucky as the blue grass and bourbon state, all above ground features, though its what's below the ground there that fascinated us on one spring vacation to Mammoth cave.We explored the tunnel-like system that stretched for miles and the incredible limestone formations that pointed like teeth from every nook and cranny. Stalagmites point toward the ceiling while stalactites point from the ceiling to the ground, many were amber in color and shaped in eerie odd patterns. The limestone formation deposits form when water drips through the cave fissures are truly spectacular.After poking and spielunking underground at Mammoth, we switched gears and headed to a nearby working farm in Henderson.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave is less than 90 minutes north of Nashville on I-65. I first visited in 1978 as a 3rd grade Brownie scout. My wide-eyed fascination at all that's available to explore under central Kentucky has not diminished after thirty years and dozens of visits. I've introduced many of my Middle TN elementary students to this limestone marvel, the longest known cave system in the world. I love that every generation is equally awed by Mammoth Cave. You will not be sorry you made this a day or weekend trip destination or added it as a side trip on a drive through KY.If you can only take one tour, I recommend the 2 hour Historic Tour as you will hear the interesting stories behind the discovery and commercialization of Mammoth Cave and see large passageways, domes, tight squeezes, and all the most well known spots, like Fat Man's Misery and the Bottomless Pit. The 75 minute Frozen Niagara Tour has beautiful stalactites and stalagmites if you would rather view more decorative cave features and take a shorter tour. The 2 hour Domes and Dripstones Tour (formerly called the New Passage Tour) offers the full Frozen Niagara Tour plus great depths and ascensions via steel stair cases to view domes and pits. This is my second favorite tour. Avoid this one if you don't manage stairs well.Skip the short summer Discovery Tour unless you simply have no other time options…you will leave feeling so disappointed you didn't have time for more. It's for people with very limited time.More serious cavers may want to try the Wild Cave Tour available to enthusiasts 16 and older. There is much scenic beauty to explore outside the cave as well, particularly on a trail that begins near the entrance to the Historic Tour. There are hiking and bike trails throughout the greater Mammoth Cave National Park. There is a National Park hotel and some older cottage rentals on the property. A camp ground is nearby as well. In the summer shorts and tennis shoes are fine if that's what you show up in, but bring along a lightweight fleece or sweatshirt. While the cave stays a constant temperature all year, you'll want to dress with more layers in fall, winter, and spring. Whatever you would wear outside is usually comfortable in the cave.

I took the historic tour on one day and the domes and dripstones tour on the other. Both tours are great, but if I had to choose between one I would pick the domes and dripstones tour. The historic tour is fascinating too though. It takes you through the caves and the views are simply amazing. The domes and dripstones tour also has some beautiful views. Unfortunately, you can't take pictures with flash, which means that you have to prepare to take good pictures without flash or make sure you have a steady hand due to the longer exposure time.

They have 4-5 tours in total. The guide was exceptional and explained the history of the caves from formation, 5000 year old natives, to 1930's workers.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave is a true wonder of the natural world. The impressiveness of this cavern is in it's length. If you're looking for classic cave formations with colored lights and cutsie names, Lester Dill has a fine cave in Missouri called Meramec Caverns that you should see if you've the chance. But if you've seen plenty of those or if you just want to see the amazement of the natural process in person, you've got to take a tour or two of Mammoth Cave. It nearly unfathomable how immense this cavern is. Truly, there are not many formations here, but there are some. Do your homework in advance to ensure that you get on the tour that will give you the experience you seek. When you're on your tour and almost finished, ask your guide how much of the cavern you've seen. There's a lot of very interesting history here about this cavern system and how it was discovered and explored. There's also a lot of human interest history here, some of it is just plain shocking. Don't leave without hearing about who Stephen Bishop and Floyd Collins are and a little about their stories. If you're a cave lover, I won't say anymore. You know you've got to see this one. It's the holy grail. If you're a casual enthusiast, take it from me, you won't be sorry you drove all the way out here to see this. You'll probably decide to stay a second day for a different tour. If you're whiny, don't like caves, think you might say where are the stalagmites or are there bats in here, know that there are several fine mini golf establishments in the area. Your party will pick you up in about half a day. But you'll be sorry you missed it.","March 1, 2015",A true wonder of the world,107,,5

The Historic tour is in the dry part of the cave so there are no stalactites and stalagmites. What you will find are massive rooms and passages; and a very tight walk through “fat man's misery.” The Domes and Drips tour is in the wet part of the cave and has areas of stalactites and stalagmites including the Frozen Niagara formation. There are roughly 300 stairs and an amazing 250 foot vertical drop. Both tours are 2-hours long.,"February 16, 2015",Mammoth Cave,8,"Clarksville, Tennessee",5

Mammoth Cave,"My wife and I did the Violet City Lantern Tour. This is a more expensive, limited tour where you only use gas lanterns (supplied) for light. I have been caving all over the world, mostly in ""touristy"" caves and this was the best cave tour I have ever been on. It was eerie, informative, immense, amazing. If you are not afraid of the dark, I would HIGHLY recommend this tour and see how the early cave explorers did their exploring by lantern light.","January 25, 2015",One of the Best Cave Adventures Ever,62,"Westchester, New York, United States",5

Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I were on the ""Historic Tour"" which was 2 hours. It looked like everyone else wanted to do the same. There was 2 sets of people going through, I understand why. A lot of walking, but the views were fabulous. We enjoyed it immensely! The giants tomb, fat man's misery were a lot of fun to experience. I wouldn't recommend it to those who have difficulty getting around or with small children (there are other tours better for them) but for others, it is needed to be experienced!

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave is a gorgeous natural marvel. Stalactites, stalagmites, subterranean lakes and rivers abound. The grandness of the caves is well worth the price and the visitor center is located on spacious grounds.

Mammoth Cave,"Nice visitor center- we picnicked in the park. It was 24 degrees then we took the Historical Tour for about 2.5 hours- Great presentation, history and geology. Lots of walking and a lot of stairs but worth it.. Think twice about small toddler children unless you want to carry them. You should be stable on your feet and capable of climbing 6 flights of stairs. Take a bottle of water! It is dry and dusty. This is a massive cave system and impressive.

Mammoth Cave,"Though we have visited to other Cave systems, we never imagined the huge size of the caves at Mammoth NP. The name does justify the description of this attraction. As we visited on the Christmas weekend, the park was less crowded and we were able to get two tours ( The Frozen Niagara and The Historic tour).Frozen Niagara is a short drive from the Park office/ Information center and is relatively easy to do. It lasted for an hour and the Tour guide was enthusiastic to mention all the details. It happens to be his last tour as he was getting retired on the month end. He also agreed to give us a chance to feel the darkness by switching off the light system inside the cave :)The Historic tour was a moderate rated tour and it really tested or Physical fitness. It lasted more than 2 hours and we got the chance to see some of the biggest cave's as well as part of the Gothic Avenue Tour ( nineteenth-century candle-written signatures on the cave wall ). The fat man misery was really a fun part to cross. We would love to come back and do other tours in the summer.","January 5, 2015",One of the wonders of Mother Nature,47,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",5
Mammoth Cave,"We went on the ""domes and dripstones"" tour, and I would recommend it. The tour guide alluded to some beautiful stalagmites and stalactites at the end of the tour, but I wasn't too impressed by those. But really the cave is so impressive anyway. The guide was informative and entertaining. I hope to go back someday and do another tour.This tour was listed as moderate. There were many stairs, but also 3 stops along the way to sit. So not very difficult of a hike in my opinion. Please don't bring a child strapped to your front on these tours...there is no place to escape when your child starts screaming.With a 2 hour tour, plus the displays to look at I'd say plan to spend at least 3 hours here.","January 5, 2015",So much Fun!,17,"Lafayette, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"Online it showed all the caverns closed but another business that was open said all the caves were open so we took a shot and sure enough. What a great cave and all its history. Some of the staircases were steep but hang on to the rail and you will be fine.

Best thing to do-go through the descriptions listed on the official website and see which one best suits your family. I was traveling with 7 kids ages 8-15 and had a few hours to spend at Mammoth Cave. I picked the Historic Tour, it was 2 hours long with enough walking and steps for the younger ones to enjoy, but not get too tired. I made reservations online and highly recommend doing so, especially during the summer. Our park ranger was very knowledgable and funny!! The cave is beautiful and well preserved.

We took the historic tour and for two hours were entertained by the enthusiastic, informative and funny Eric, our National Park Ranger/Guide. This is a huge cave. You won't get a lot of great photos in here, apart from the entrance, but it's lots of fun. Warnings, there are lots of steps, lots of walking and some tight squeezes if you are claustrophobic. Don't miss it.","January 2, 2015",Lives up to expectation,348,Bangkok,5
Mammoth Cave,We have been to several national parks and this one will not make the favorites list. The only way you can tour the cave is on a guided tour so you are constantly moving at someone else's pace. We did the historic tour. It was fine - we did have some unruly and loud kids on the tour which made it more annoying - stuck behind loud obnoxious people who were either going to fast or too slow. I was also under the impression that the tour capped around 25 and there were closer to 50 or 60 people. It was fine just a bit frustrating. There is better stuff out there. ,"January 2, 2015",Meh,65,"Chattanooga, Tennessee, United States",3

Mammoth Cave,"We took that Gothic tour, which took us through a section of the cave where there are several stalactites, stalagmites, and columns that are very large. This place is not called ""Mammoth"" by chance. Not only is it the largest cave in the world (and still being mapped out), some of the rooms in this cave are larger than some churches, with ceilings over 100' high. Some 390+ MILES of this cave have been mapped and more miles are being discovered and added every year. There are several tour options and I don't know which is ""the best"" because each of them show you a different area and different features of the cave.I wish we could have explored the grounds more, but it was rainy and we only had time to walk down to the headwaters of River STYX. That's only a short 1/2 mile jaunt from the Visitors' Center. The guides were knowledgeable about the cave and the geology and were very approachable. I recommend this attraction very much!","December 28, 2014","Great cave, beautiful area",66,"Dodgeville, Wisconsin",5

Mammoth Cave,"This cave is huge, some 400 miles in length, more is being discovered. We took two tours: the Historic Tour and the Domes & Dripstones Tour. The Historic Tour is to walk for 2 miles inside a very dry cave, just rocks and rocks and more rocks. It is impressive, but not pretty. Most part of the Domes & Dripstones Tour is just like the Historic Tour, very dry rocks everywhere. Only near the end of the tour, there are some water coming down, so we can see the formation of the live stone columns: stalactite (which grows downwards) and stalagmite (which grows upwards). If you are short of time, you only need to do the Domes & Dripstones Tour, which includes the dry cave and the wet cave. You won't miss anything else. Of course you can do more tours if you really like caving.","December 23, 2014",mostly a fascinating dry cave,205,Michigan,4
Mammoth Cave,"mammoth cave is perfect for those with an appreciation for nature, best time to visit is spring and summer due to the longer park hours, make sure you wear very comfortable walking shoes and don't object to walking at least a mile with a few breaks here and there, I recommend getting into the gym a month before your visit if you are out of shape, bring a deposable camera, you drop your phone it will never be found, the cave have several tours so I would recommend staying in Kentucky for a week so you can pace yourself, there are bourbon distillery tours, I went on the Evan Williams distillery tour, museums downtown Louisville, Kentucky derby park, fort Knox to name a few, I made the mistake of visiting for only two days.","December 22, 2014",mammoth cave for my birthday,0,"Hyattsville, Maryland",5

Mammoth Cave,"Just recently visited the Mammoth Cave Nat'l Park for the second time, and must say I will remember this time better than my first time there. Our first time thru we went on the Mammoth Passage Tour, and I remember very little about that tour. This time we went on the Domes and Dripstones Tour and saw the Frozen Niagara and the beautiful dripstones area. I would suggest that you read about every tour to decide which one you will feel most comfortable participating in. Many of them have lots of stairs to navigate, tight spots, wet areas, and big drops. So if you are claustrophobic or have a fear of heights, you might want to choose one of the easier tours. Mammoth Cave was impressive, but I think I prefer some of the smaller caves like Ruby Falls.","December 19, 2014",Second trip more memorable than first one.,83,"Wooster, Ohio",4
Mammoth Cave,"As silly as it sounds, a visit a few years back I was unable to view the cave as the group with me chose not to tour after reading the cave tour descriptions. This time was a charm--well, except for the tour itself. The park personnel were accomodating considering we were there for the last tour of the day. We chose the ""Frozen Niagara"" since it was available in the winter, and it seemed the least strenuous after reading the description. Our tour guide was quite friendly and knowledgeable. Since this is the longest cave in the US, I somehow expected a little longer tour than the Niagara offered. The tour was approximately an hour, although the actual cave tour was about thirty minutes. Still, the formations were beautiful, and I was surprised to see how surrounded I was with spider crickets on the ceilings when the ranger illuminated with his flashlight. I would like to highlight that some physical prowness is required for this tour which included some slickness under foot and some tight squeezes although knee crawling isn't required. I am glad that I can now say I have toured a portion of Mammoth Cave. My husband stated that the coffee in the lodge restaurant leaves a lot to be desired.","December 16, 2014",Finally Saw Mammoth!,15,Alabama,4
Mammoth Cave,"This is a 'must see' attraction. I've been to quite a lot of caverns and this is not one of the prettier ones. After seeing the spectacular formations of Blanchard Springs, the formations seemed rather dull. However, one can hardly criticize the world's longest known cave system! Although the formations weren't as breathtaking as some other caves, the history and the immensity of it was awe-inspiring. The natural entrance is well worth the walk, even if your tour doesn't leave from there. Don't miss it! It's hard to imagine being the person who first came upon that entrance and how incredulous they must have been! It was sad to hear that although the cave is still being explored by volunteers, as it has been for years, each year there are fewer and fewer people interested in participating. Younger people seem to be too busy with their tech gadgets. Maybe a visit to Mammoth would perk their interest.You could spend the whole day here, because they have several different tours, and the park itself is very beautiful. If you have limited time, take at least one tour and get a sense of the magnitude of this natural wonder.Tip: Be sure to go online and look at the tour schedule before you set out on your adventure. We didn't realize how many different tours there were, and because of the time we got there, the only one that fit conveniently into our schedule was the Frozen Niagara. It was great, but it would have been nice to have options, or maybe do two different tours. Best to plan ahead.","December 15, 2014",Awe-inspiring. Be sure to see the natural entrance!,112,"Houston, TX",5
Mammoth Cave,"Perhaps the nicest thing about Mammoth Cave is that it still has its natural entrance, which is huge and surrounded by lush ferns growing by the hundreds around the cave's rocky sides. The door to cave is set back perhaps 75 feet inside the cave so that visitors can have the experience of walking into the natural cave, which is kind of eerie, but in a nice way. A wind blows from the cave mouth that feels like air conditioning in summer. Once inside, the cave doesn't have the many beautiful stalactites and stalagmites of some caves, so that entrance is really what's exciting about Mammoth. My husband and I first came upon the entrance at the end of a hike we'd taken while waiting for the start time for our tour. We starting to get uncomfortably warm when we suddenly felt like we were walking into air conditioning. A little further and we could see the mouth. My heart skipped a beat at the sight of it. We asked an official if it would be all right for us to walk down in there for a few minutes even though we weren't starting a tour. We were told it would be fine.","December 14, 2014",Main cave entrance worth special attention,17,"Asheville, NC",5

We took the Drips and Domes tour and it was overwhelming and awe-inspiring. There where many different types of rock formations and the guide explained them all PLUS talked about the Eco-system that exists.It's quite reasonable at $14/person for the tours. There's a lot to see above ground including an interpretative museum, lots of birds and wildlife (saw a large herd of deer and a FLOCK of bluebirds!!). Visitors can stay in cabins or a motel. There's certainly enough to see for an extended stay. Canoe rentals for the Green River are just outside the park for anyone interested.

Mammoth Cave,"We visited Mammoth Cave on a weekend in December, which is clearly the offseason. The tour group seemed large at about 40 people. In busier times, these tours can hold more than 100! I expect that having such a large crowd would dampen the natural beauty of the cave and I doubt I would have enjoyed the tour as much. We did 3 tours: - Historic Tour: This was by far our favorite tour. It takes you from the visitor center over 300 feet underground, winding through small spaces and large domes. There is interesting history here from the cave's days as a saltpeter mine. Would highly recommend this one! - Gothic Tour: This tour starts on the same trail as the Historic Tour and diverges to an area in the cave that was highly traveled during tours in the 1800s. The most interesting sight are names of travelers from that time that were burned into the walls and ceilings. Frankly, I think this would be one to skip. - Domes and Dripstones: Taking place at a different, man-made cave entrance, this tour contains a section of wet cave that may be more familiar to many visitors. The most interesting section may be the initial climb down long stairs to the caverns below. Not for the claustrophobic. Note that this tour contains all of the Frozen Niagra tour. Hope this helps.

And getting up very early to view deer which were sort of rare at the time but no more.My wife to be and I visited with friends in grad school and stayed at the new hotel. Amenities but not the same. But what was exciting to a small boy may not be so good later.The deer are still there. The trails and history in the area are all worthwhile.And of course the cave is still absolutely great. They have to take more care now that all the CO2 we humans breath out and the lights tend to alter the inside environment but it is still amazing.

We had a lot of kids and elderly people on our tours but they were taken care of nicely. This National Park is WAY more than just the cave. Unbeknownst to us it is inside a beautifully taken care of park that has camping as well as a hotel and some cabins. These facilities are only open in the warmer months however.

We arrived at the Visitor Center a half hour before the tour as it was suggested in the confirmation email. We did not gather for the tour until 5 minutes before it started, but I'm glad we got there early - there's a store you can spend some time at, buy a souvenir or two. We were on the Historic Tour - a 2hr 2 mile tour. Spectacular! The first part of the tour was easy, as the areas were large but it got more interesting as we went further in the cave, we had to turn sideways to get through some spots, and had to climb some 400+ steps overall.. Great tour!! The tour guide was knowledgeable and funny. As we went though, we didn't have time to stop and take great pictures, but we did take a few. If I were doing this again, I would stay in the back of the group, take all the pictures I want, taking my time, and just making sure I catch up with the group every now and then. He does make 3 stops to talk, so you can catch up at that time. The other thing I would do if I were to do it over again, I would add the 20 minute tour to our historic tour. With that one you get to see stalagmites & stalactites as well.","November 30, 2014",Unforgettable experience!,202,Michigan,5

Mammoth Cave,"We took 3 tours at Mammoth. They were all good. Notable was the Onyx lantern tour which they do not always have. It was beautiful. Going off season means fewer people on the tour and more info from the Ranger. On the Onyx tour we went on a section not usually on the tour. Mammoth is open all year. There are fewer trail offerings in winter but according to the Ranger, you will probably have the tour to yourself. The trails above ground are beautiful as well and there is plenty of wildlife to enjoy. The rangers are awesome by the way.

Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I took the Historic Tour and the Dripstones tour. Both vary in the areas of the cave they show you as well as what you are shown. Both of us agreed the Historic tour was better. It is a longer tour but worth the time. We hardly noticed how long it was. It was interesting to see that yes, this wonderfully huge cave has been very defaced and commercialized, but for many, many years. Some of the cave markings date back to the 1800s. We were walking towards the front with the guide which, if possible, make all efforts to do this. In between the short informational stops along the way where he addresses the whole group, he provided us with commentary on the cave as well as some of the history of the area. Without this, we would not have learned nearly as much as we did or enjoyed our tour as much. This tour does have some tight spaces and moderate climbing. If you have trouble with stairs, PLEASE do not take this tour. At the end (after you have walked for a while), you have to go up a lot of stairs. There was a gentleman on our tour that had a lot of trouble going up. For those of you worried about claustrophobia, I am EXTREMELY claustrophobic but only felt a slight panic (very slight) during the entire tour. The dripstones tour, while nice, was just not our cup of tea. If you wish to see cave formations, go to Diamond Caverns up the road.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth cave sits within a seemingly endless expanse of lovely forrest that is a wonder in itself, but what lies beneath is the real gem. After touring the top notch museum set to engage both children and adults, we took the historical tour and enjoyed a long, long foray into the early days of the cave system through the original entrance. Hungry for more, we took a tour combining the niagra falls of formations with an engineering marvel of an entrance through a seeping sinkhole via winding stairs that seem to defy gravity. From dry caves that preserve early American mining to actively wet caves that wow you with their variety, and from cave crickets below ground to deer and wild turkey above ground, Mammoth was engaging for all 4 hours in the caves, and a few more above ground. I only wish we had more time on a weekend or in summer to fit in more tours, but winter made for smaller tours.

My husband and I arrived early for our Frozen Niagra tour so rangers suggested we take a hike down to the original cave entrance. There is a steep paved roadway( at least my 60 year old knees thought so) leading to the Cave entrance with benches ( thank God) all along the way and some hiking trails for the more adventurous. It was worth a trip down and a staircase led into the actual cave, although it is locked off you can access the early part of the tunnel without a guide. The Frozen Niagra tour was perfect for an older couple and is a good introduction to Mammoth Cave. I have heard great things about the Historic Tour but we could not fit this into our schedule - maybe next time...","November 17, 2014",Home to the World's longest Known Cave System!!!!!!,281,Rhode Island,4
Mammoth Cave,"The park has a nice assortment of tours so there truly is something for everyone. We did two of the tours: a four year old was on the first that did great, I think everyone on the second struggled at one time or another. The guide can make a huge difference. Our first guide was fun and informative while assuring our safety. Our second guide plunged us into total darkness at least three times with no warning: extremely dangerous. Hope he'll retire SOON!","November 13, 2014","National Park, Natural Wonder",45,"Porters Falls, WV",5
Mammoth Cave,"We visited Mammoth Cave and had a great time doing the Historic Tour. Although these caves are not as pretty as some we have been to, the sheer size of this is overwhelming! This is a fairly strenuous tour, 2 miles of walking with quite a few stairs at the end. A fun way to spend a few hours!","November 13, 2014",Historic tour,105,"Tequesta, Florida",4
Mammoth Cave,"In the heat of the summer it's a nice place to get some natural relief at 57 degrees. This is truly a remarkable place in the middle of the bluegrass. My oldest two kids (12 & 10) went on the ""Trog"" expedition where they were fitted with full body coveralls, helmets, & head lamps. They got to crawl around for a few hours with their small statured guide along with other children. I took the younger kids on a more conservative tour which was more their pace. If your kids start whining, just tell them you will leave them in the cave and that will straighten them up.","November 12, 2014",Great place to take adventurous kids,12,"Louisville, Kentucky",4
Mammoth Cave,"We took the 2hr Historic Tour and were not disappointed. The tour itself was considered to be moderate in difficulty...quite a bit of walking, stairs and very narrow paths that required you to crouch down & squeeze through. The cave is also very dimly lit and dark in some places. If you are afraid of heights or claustrophobic...some areas of the cave may be an issue. Our guide was very knowledgeable on the history of the cave and one of the most fascinating things was seeing firsthand the evidence of past explorers. Dated signatures of these explorers are written on the rocks throughout the cave...some in candle smoke writing. The smoke stains from the kerosene lanterns and scrapes on the rocks from those who worked in the cave are quite a sight to see. It is evident that this cave has attracted so many throughout the years....way back to prehistoric times. Mammoth Cave has a beautiful eeriness to it that you must see to appreciate. Pictures do not do this place justice. The cost of this tour was $12/person... very reasonable for a 2hr informative tour. There are other types of tours as well that vary in price, length of tour and difficulty. If you are in the area, this place is well worth the stop!","November 11, 2014",Historic Beauty!,28,"Racine, Wisconsin",5
Mammoth Cave,"I suppose that as a Kentucky native I had been expecting more, but Mammoth Cave is really just a very large hole in the ground created by nature (and the Green River). The tours are not free, even with a senior Golden Pass, although it is a national park. We took two tours, and after about 15 minutes, you felt as if you had had enough. It is a dry cave, so there are no colorful formations - lots of history, lots of darkness, but not that interesting.","November 9, 2014","A large cave with lots of history, but....",260,"Springfield, Virginia",3
Mammoth Cave,"The caves seem to be the major attraction here, but the park itself is worthy of exploration. We took the Niagra Underground Tour and it was a good experience but the park's beauty is also a good experience. The paths are well defined and the canopy was full and colorful. There were water features that made the hikes more enjoyable. Picnic tables were frequent enough that we were able to choose when to have lunch. On our drive out, we took the Green River Ferry across the Green River which was unusual and scenic.","November 8, 2014",Underground but surface beauty,87,"Saint Cloud, Minnesota",5
Mammoth Cave,"I've been visiting this place since I was 10 Years old. I Am now 70 years old and glad to report it's still the same.

Mammoth Cave,We loved Mammoth Cave! I went a couple weekends ago and the weather was perfect and the experience was very informative. There is a discount for active duty military also. Mammoth cave is part of the national parks so if you have the passport you will get a stamp. The tour we did was the Niagra falls and I recommend this one! We saw so many structures and learned a lot about the history. There are some small spaces to walk through and it can get a bit dark. Overall a wonderful experience!,"November 4, 2014",Wonderful afternoon trip,47,"Hampton, Virginia",5
Mammoth Cave,"I have been wanting to go to Mammoth Cave since I was a young boy. My family stopped at another cave and that was enough for them. Now, as an adult, I finally made it.Mammoth Cave is located in south central Kentucky. They are located south of Louisville, Ky and north of Nashville, TN. They are the largest cave systems in the world. We stayed in Bowling Green the night before and it was only about 30 - 45 min drive to the caves.My wife and I took two tours last week. We first went on the Historical tour. This tour shows the main entrance to the cave and features historical notes on the use and development of the cave. The use of slave labor in the cave is a prominent theme. It was an outstanding lesson and a decent workout. We had no problems on this tour, but there a many low and narrow parts of the cave. This tour requires walking and a minimum amount of tolerance to exercise. This section of the cave is dry, so no stalagmites or stalactites. We took a second 'Domes and Dripstones Tour'. with about an hour and a half between tours. This tour journeyed down a sink hole. It was definitely strenuous than the Historical tour. They do warn you. You start out by being bussed to the entrance and have to pass through a lock system to descend into the cave system. This is a wet cave so you do see some stalagmites and stalactites.Each tour has its sites and attributes that are unique. The park ranger was the one that suggested this combination for us. My wife and I are in our late 50 and early 60s. You do get a discount with the ""America the Beautiful - Senior Pass"". This pass is available for $10 to US citezens over 62 and is good for life. It is also good at other National parks that have fees, so the one time cost is negligible. I saved enough on these two tours to pay for the card.","November 3, 2014",Finally at the cave,16,"Chicago, Illinois, United States",5
Mammoth Cave,"We did not reserve a tour and were fortunate to arrive when there was one starting that had spaces available. We had a large group of 120 people. As they say this is the longest cave I the world at 400 miles and they are discovering more passages. The tour was quite interesting, particularly the history of the cave. This is a dry cave and thus no Stalactites or stalagmites as in caverns. There are bats, but they did not come out for us. When the turn off the lights at 300 Ft below ground things are very dark and very quiet.Definitely recommend a visit here.","November 2, 2014",excellent attraction,235,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",4
Mammoth Cave,"You can really do as much or as little as suits you.This National Park has no admission fee, but the tours do have a fee. If you don't do a cave tour, this place is free to visit. There is quite a lot of trails, some of them are wheelchair accessible.We took the Domes and Dripstones tour, only $14.00 each!. Very good tour. If you can do 500 steps I'd recommend it! If you can do another 98 steps there's an ""optional"" room you really should see. There are some spaces that get pretty confined, the worst part is during the initial stair descent from the entrance. I'm a really big guy (think 4X shirts) and I was briefly uncomfortable with the tightness, part of the initial staircase down really is a squeeze for someone my size, but I made it through! The tour guide said it got tight but that we'd all fit, and she was right! I would have liked to taken another tour the next day but the steps from the Domes and Dripstones tour was all I could do. We did however hike in the woods the following day for 2 1/2 hours, beautiful!","October 31, 2014",As little or as much as you want to do.,69,"Cedar Rapids, Iowa",5
Mammoth Cave,"My wife and I decided to visit Mammoth Cave while planning another Kentucky adventure. We decided to stay the night in the local hotel cottage. Having been our first adventure into a cave system, we were not entirely sure of what to expect. We had prearranged two tours for the day: Domes and Dripstones and the Star Chamber lantern tour. I will elaborate on certain aspects of our awesome trip.Welcome Center: A gorgeous building with plenty to see, buy, and do. You can tell that it was somewhat new as it was modern yet had a woody feel. You can buy your tickets here (or pick them up if preordered), visit gift shops, and travel an informational hall about the cave. Various park rangers are here to assist you with questions.Hotel Cottages: A cute arrangement of 10 single room cottages. They only have air conditioning (no heating) and for that reason, are only rentable until the end of October. The room was a bit rustic, woodsy and quaint. The morning sun breaking through the woods outside of the front door, the acorns dropping, leaves falling...it was so peaceful.Domes and Dripstones Tour: First off, 118 people can go on this tour. I am really at a loss of the names of the two rangers that gave the tour but they were AMAZING. The two gentlemen had a mastery of knowledge, about history, and how to captivate an audience. The rangers educated us as to what to expect so that people did not go down that couldn't finish. There are winding stairs, some turning and shuffling of bodies needed, and patience for people to take it all in. That being said, we had people using flashes on cameras, trying to take video, children who were WAY too young to enjoy it and were crying, kids getting sick, etc. In light of this, we did not let it stop our enjoyment and fascination. At certain stops, you can sort of reorganize and get behind other people that did not annoy you. With all of that being said, we took some outstanding photos that we will remember for a lifetime.Star Chamber Tour: The two rangers we had on this tour were the same two from our previous. This time, we had 40 people, it was later in the day, more of a family feel, and led by lantern light. This tour was amazing! We saw 3500 year old artifacts, history of early settlers, people looking for disease cures, and mining among other things. We walked with our lanterns through the prehistoric cave as early visitors did. See it for many memories.Other than this, I have to say that the trails were very peaceful to walk on, nicely marked so you did not get lost, and extensive. The only downside to the whole experience was that the hotel section was in dire need of some renovating. I had the feel like the hotel in The Shining, waiting for some creepy kids to run out lol. With such a modern welcome center, perhaps a renovation is in the near future.We hope this information helps others decide on what to do on their visit!!","October 30, 2014",A Truly Mammoth Cave,27,"Medina, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"This is the longest cave system in the world! 400 milestone! Spend the whole day here. We took the historic tour and frozen niagara. Take the historic (what most of the cave looks like) and the domes and drips tones (cave formations pretty). Trails are around the park. There are lots of deer. Walk turn hole bend trail, cedar spring, green bluffs overlook, and explore the visitor center. Kids can take the jr. Ranger program and earn a certificate and badge. Visit the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace 50 miles north.","October 25, 2014",Must see in Kentucky,9,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"I have been here a few times. Todays trip was just a one day drive from the Lexington area. My 11 year old daughter and myself drove down and enjoyed one of the easier tours. The tour guides were really great and informative. The Visitor Center is always very clean. And today was the first time I had a picnic in the picnic area. It was well kept and quiet even though there was some sort of student group there. I do wish the Churches and cemeteries were better kept. I was really impressed with how things were preserved in the Smokey Mountains, especially in Cades Cove and the Roaring Forks Trail. But outside of this Mammoth Park is just beautiful!","October 25, 2014",Relaxing,5,"Nicholasville, Kentucky",4
Mammoth Cave,"While we did enjoy the tour, I believe it important to caution seniors with mobility issues on what will be encountered on this tour. The description tells you that this is a 2 hour tour that is 2 miles in distance with a total of 440 steps. We didn't read a full description before beginning the tour - just went up to the ticket counter and bought tickets like everyone else.One issue is that any verbal cautions come outside where the tour gathers right before you begin the tour. At this point, there is a tendency to say ""Well, we already bought the tickets and I don't want everyone to see me back out"", so few people opt out at this point. Once you've entered the cave, there is no opt out or bypass route available, so you're in it for the long haul.Be aware that the floor of the caves are wet and can be slippery. I was wearing boat shoes and slipped in spots. The lighting is not very bright if that's an issue for you. There are a few tight spots. They mention Fat Man's Misery, which is a bit tight and winding, but another tough spot required bending over to a right angle at the waist while going down winding stairs with minimal clearance.There are inclines up and down in the cave and numerous spots of rough footing. We were led at a very brisk pace through the caves, with less commentary than one would expect on a two hour, two mile tour. Finally, the number of stairs can be a problem for some.While I made it through OK ( and my in shape wife had no problem), I did want to point out the challenges for those with mobility issues. One person in our group sprained an ankle and did not think she could manage the 155 stairs up at the conclusion of the tour. We never did find out how she got out of the cave.Consider this only a public service announcement. By all means, take the tour if you're able.","October 25, 2014","Senior Alert - the Historic Tour does have a ""Moderate"" difficulty level",25,"Concord, New Hampshire",4
Mammoth Cave,We didn't even get to take an official tour because the ones we wanted to do were sold out. I never dreamed - it was mid week in October! So….. we stayed one night (rooms were typical park like and seemed clean) The restaurant was actually decent and served wine and beer. We had quite a few TV channels but no wifi or cell service for AT&T. We did a few hikes which were very nice and peeked into the cave as far as we could go.

Mammoth Cave,"Took the Mammoth easy tour one afternoon and the Onyx Lantern tour the next day. The center is very well run and has a plethora of different tours to select depending on what is available that day, length of tour, level of difficulty, and interest. The 2 tours we selected covered 2 different areas of the caves. There are 26 different entrances to the caves and 16 miles that are open for exploration. Our guide for first Mammouth Tour was a descendent of the slave that had been the first guide in the caves in the 1800's and really brought to life a lot of the history of the caves. The second guide was well informed and humorous and also brought a lot of history into the tour. I would say that the 2 tours we took were not of ""pretty"" caves. I'm sure there are others that are. Park guides and personal were all friendly and informative, a great visit.","October 25, 2014",Lots of History,55,"Clearwater, Florida, United States",5

Mammoth Cave,"The underground tours offered by this beautifully run National Park are amazing. No doubt, the popular ones are fabulous. We, for instance, were told to do the Domes & Dripstones and Historic tours. But, after we did the D&D, we were encouraged by the fabulous National Park Service ranger to try the Oynx Cave tour. And I just must say: It is amazing. Though one should be in very good physical condition to do it, the payoff is enormous: among the ""gems"" are gypsum flowers, and of the finest order! Such flowers are crystal formations, and they are just fabulously beautiful. On THAT tour, then, we were advised to try the Violet City Cave Tour. This one is truly unforgettable. Just do both! The above-ground trails near the Visitor Center are also fantastic if you have time between tours. And dogs are welcome everywhere but inside the cave.","October 23, 2014",Violet City and Onyx Cave -- DO NOT MISS!,132,"New York City, New York",5

Mammoth Cave,"We took the Violet City Lantern Tour this past weekend at Mammoth Caves. I will be the first to say that I am by no means ""outdoorsy""...hiking is probably the last activity that would seem appealing to me, especially hiking up hills without handrails in the relative darkness. However, I really enjoyed this tout. My fiance booked it as a surprise and I was anxious as it's rated ""strenuous""-the first mile is easy, the second is moderate, and the last is strenuous. Those are accurate descriptions. I am not by any means physically fit, and, while I made it through this tour, the last mile is difficult due to many nearly vertical, slippery climbs and one of the meanest sets of stairs you'll ever see. The tour guides really made the trip, Ranger John and Ranger Chris. They were knowledgeable, funny and encouraging. Ranger John did an excellent job corralling some unruly members of the group that were extremely loud and irritating (please talk quietly...the cave echoes). Both Rangers had a lot of interesting stories and facts and really placed the cave into a historical perspective. The tour takes about 3 hours, so plan accordingly, but it's a great way to spend a morning at Mammoth Caves.","October 22, 2014",Violet City Lantern Tour,31,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,We did the Lantern tour starting at 5:00pm It showed a new perspective of how the visitors would have seen the caves before electricity. It was very interesting.

Mammoth Cave,"We only had time for one tour on our visit to this national park, so we chose the Mammoth Passage one because it's described as providing a good introduction to the enormous labyrinth of caves/passageways that is Mammoth Cave N.P. It was a great introduction. We aren't claustrophobic, but even if we had just a touch of it, I think we could still do this tour because the passageways and the ""rooms"" are large. Still, it is a cave network and it is dark inside, so folks who do have claustrophobia probably don't want to visit this park. We had an excellent guide, which was a real plus. The tour is described as ""easy,"" but that only refers to the interior tour itself - the walk back up to the visitors' center is steep.","October 20, 2014",Mammoth Passage tour,87,"Greer, SC",4

Mammoth Cave,Took the Historic tour. Glad I purchased tickets 6 weeks in advance as almost all tours were sold out. Would have been a shame to have showed up and not seen the cave. There are hiking trails on surface but nothing special. The visitors center was nice and you can easily spend an hour here while waiting on your tour to begin. Seems like we had 50-60 people in our group with two Rangers. Tour took 2 hours but only walked about an hour and the other hour was rangers talking. They definitely add to the experience. They have to cover all disclaimers before tour begins and make hike sound like it could be strenuous but it is not. Even all the steps at end were no problem. There are no interesting cave formations here but the size of this cave is what is so amazing. Definitely worth a detour to visit here. It is imperative that you purchase tickets in advance. And plan on at least 4 hours. Not many National Parks where you can see majority of attractions in such a shirt amount of time. Will never be considered a top ten National Park but is still something worth seeing anytime you find yourself in Kentucky.,"October 13, 2014",Very fascinating place,192,"Hickory, North Carolina",4

Bring a jacket with a hood- if it's raining you will get wet getting to and from the entrances. Wear walking shoes. I also brought along a sweatband and you can bring a water bottle. Both trips were great. I especially liked the tight turns and low ceilings on the Historic tour. The guides were informative and willing to answer questions. There was a lot of history presented, I would have liked a bit more geology and archeology info. We may stop on the way back north for another tour or two. The guides explained that the caves weren't setup as ""showy"" caves but were left in their natural state.

He truly knew everything about the caves. He warned all of use before we boarded the bused that this is pretty strenuous and lots of stairs, He warned its going to be wet so you can slip and or fall and its dark.

Start to finish, our national parks are amazing and confirm their tax dollars are well deserved. Amazing decent via stainless steel staircases and handrail system. Fairly large cave rooms with one end featuring heavy formations that are well let and you get very up close and personal with them. If your wanting only formations though, Marengo Cave has more formations than anything I've ever seen.

Mammoth Cave,"It was a hot and humid day upon our arrival. As we entered the cave, the welcoming rush of cool air escaping from the underground cavern was like a natural air conditioner. Upon entering Mammoth Cave, I was expecting it to be more like the other caves I had been in. But one thing is sure, Mammoth Cave is perfectly named. Because this cave system is well, MAMMOTH! It is hard to imagine there really is a world above it, when you are in it! The tours are well run, and very informative.

Mammoth Cave,"Excellent guidance through the 2-hour ""historic tour"". Ranger was very well informed and spoke very well so all could hear. He reminded all of the possible problems that a weaker person may face … not to scare, just to be honest about the conditions of the 2-mile underground, dark hike. Only a few dropped out in factor of a less-strenuous tour.

The Historic tour takes you through the enormity of the cave, and obviously does not have the beautiful formations you expect to see on most cave tours. However, you will see those formations in the final part of the Domes & Dripstones tour. Be sure to wear comfortable walking shoes and parents...do everyone a favor.

Mammoth Cave,"My wife and I are both handicapped so we opted for the easiest of the cave tours: the Frozen Niagara Cave tour. This tour costs $12 each and lasts about 1 hour, including the bus ride to and from.We avoided the optional 98 step down to the Frozen Niagara and the 98 step (now mandatory) back up to return to the main group. The entry to the main area consists of: stoop-walking for about 30 feet, skinny slant walking (tight) for about the same and some ramps and stairs. Remember, what goes down must come back up. No wheelchair access due to the skinny slant walking.It wasn't very strenuous, but was fairly wimpy. I would like to believe that the other, more strenuous, tours would be more rewarding; one of which contains over 500 stairs. At least Luray Caverns has an elevator.There is lodging on the premises as well as a snack bar and restaurant.","September 21, 2014",Frozen Niagara Tour,164,"Hilton Head, South Carolina",3

We got to hear the history of the cave and see some pretty cool things. We all want to go back again, not only to do another tour but to explore the grounds. My word of advice is that if it might rain, bring an umbrella. For the tour we took, we had to walk down a big hill and then many steps to get to the cave entrance, which is no fun in the pouring rain.","September 19, 2014",Must do!,11,"West Bend, Wisconsin, United States",5
Mammoth Cave,"I visited there as a kid, took my own kids there, and just returned from a trip with two of my grandsons, ages 8 and 12. We did the Frozen Niagra tour first. It is the easiest one --- just 1/2 mile of walking, with a handrail most of the way. It also has six small steps. I recently had back surgery, so this was about all I could handle. You return the same way. It was enough to, at least, get my feet wet. We had lunch in the coffee shop there. It was decent food and not outrageously expensive. Then I sat in the beautiful outdoors and read, while my husbands and grands took the Historic tour. This was a longer and more difficult tour and visited different areas of the cave. Ranger Dave regaled us with some great stories and history. It was a wonderful day.","September 18, 2014",An all-American must-do,17,,5
Mammoth Cave,"We took the shorter ""Frozen Niagara"" tour. This tour could have been completed in about an hour, but you go at a nice, slower pace while the guide relays interesting information about your part of the cave. First, you board a bus that takes you to the cave entrance. You walk through a revolving door, down a slope (not too steep) and into the cool air of the cave. Wear a sweater! It gets chilly unless you are accustomed to cold weather. The air is quite humid and cool. Our tour guide, Kath was extremely knowledgeable about the cave system. She even answered questions regarding a comparison with this cave to others. She truly loves her job.As for the cave, it was quite spectacular. There are lots of stalactites and stalagmites and the walk into the cave is easy. Along the way, you will stop and see several formations. There is a quick traverse through a slightly narrow area, and you must mind your head (and step) along much of the route. Just before you reach the ""frozen niagara"", your tour guide will turn off the lights. You will be in COMPLETE darkness for several seconds. If this bothers you, simply close your eyes. There are stairs leading to the bottom of the cave, which are optional, but you get to see the beauty and grandeur of the ""frozen niagara"" in it's completeness by ascending the stairs. You can still see most of it if you don't walk down the stairs and it wasn't too much more, but it was worth the extra steps. Overall a good short hike for people with small children, or people with slight mobility concerns.","September 18, 2014",Mammoth Cave - Frozen Niagara,27,"Braselton, Georgia",5
Mammoth Cave,"We took the Historic Tour. Basically a 2 mile, 2 hour, guided/narrated unground walk. Mostly a wide open cave, with a couple of narrow descents and plat formed exit. There were some artifacts left in the cave since operation. Really the only thing brought out on the tour is a stop where some guy signed his name on a wall, with a story. You won't see stalactites/stalagmites, or any thing of color, basically rock. Tour guide made the tour because of her humor. If you have health issues, don't go. We had an older couple on the tour, one carrying a cane. Right away, the guides warned people if there were doubts, to reconsider. The older couple had me scratching my head when they took the lead with the tour guide. I wondered how they were doing, I found out, on the ascent. We passed them on the plat formed exit, and they were taking a serious break. Not even out of the cave yet, they still had a steep inclined walk back to visitors center. If you are out of shape and the temperature is hot, you will sweat, walking back to your car. There are many tours, but this one was about as strenuous as we were going to take. I asked about a veteran discount, and thanks to the inquiring of the tour receptionist on my service related disability, she set me up with a lifetime National Parks Access Pass. Never was aware of such perk.","September 17, 2014","Cool, 2 hour walk.",123,"Brunswick, Ohio",3
Mammoth Cave,"We decided to stop at Mammoth Caves National Park as we were heading east. It was certainly well worth the stop. I remember seeing pictures in National Geographic in the '50s and never dreamed I would get to actually visit. We did the Historic Tour which is one of many that are offered. Some are just not for old folks like me. The Historic Tour is about a 2 mile trek with some interesting but doable challenges. There is a narrow section that meant turning sideways to navigate followed by a low passage that meant stooping along for a bit. But, those only added to the fun. Since the tour goes down 360 feet it must also return 360 feet. That meant a 155 step spiraling staircase, with frequent landings, to reach the exit level. The rangers were very friendly, informative and enthusiastic. Well worth the $6 per person (if you have the Sr. pass) or even the full $12. Be sure to wear good shoes, a light coat and comfortable clothes. I actually was in shorts with a light coat that I really did not need. The walking and effort kept the blood circulating good. However, some do need the coat. The temperature is a constant 54 degrees. Be sure to check out the constraints of other tours. Some of them are not possible for some folks. By the way...since we drive a Hybrid Camry we had priority parking. How nice is that?","September 16, 2014",Mammoth Caves -- Another one off the Bucket List,27,"Paso Robles, California",5
Mammoth Cave,Very nice place to visit but the Historic tour is rushed and it is a two mile walk and not for people who have issues with walking or mobility. It is a very nice park with lots to do. We went on two of the cave tours. They have many. We went on the Domes and Dripstones tour which was inclusive of some of the other tours. We also went on the Historic tour but it was rushed and the guide even said it was a small group. We almost ran through several sites during the tour plus even bypassed one big site because ‘someone’ unknown was there. They need to allow more time for this tour by starting it earlier in the day. The little café next to the visitor center has good food but it was swamped and understaffed when we ate there. Used dishes were piled everywhere plus most of the staff did not seem to care. One old lady behind the counter just did her job of waiting on people and did nothing else. One worker came on the job while we were there and she acted like a tornado trying to get things back in shape.

Mammoth Cave,"My wife and I arrived at the cave complex, which is part of the US National Park scheme, just before 10am intending to go on the 3/4 mile Domes & Dripstones tour. Unfortunately that was not due to start until 11.30am and we'd had to put our watches back one hour having traveled down from Louisville (on Eastern time) to the caves (on Central time!).The Historical tour was just about to leave but that is a 2 mile walk and I was unsure of my ability to do this as I walk with a cane. Anyway I did decide to have a go. The price, as holders of a National Parks Seniors Pass was a bargain $6 each for the 2 hour escorted tour.We were part of a group of about 50 people (they are prepared to take up to 120!) including about 6 young children. We had 2 guides, one leading and talking, and the other bringing up the rear ensuring nobody got lost or left behind.The walk is around 2 miles long, quite chilly in the cave, involves around 500 steps, undulating ground, some parts with low ceilings, narrow pathways, and some very narrow bits with discouraging names like Fat Man's Misery!!Our tour guides were excellent, very knowledgeable.and interesting, The speed of the walk was deliberately slowed down to ensure the group didn't become too fragmented.I did complete the walk without too much trouble although I was quite tired at the end.N.B. Photography is allowed but without flash. As the caves are very dark and only modest lighting is provided your photos will be blurred unless you rest the camera on something solid.

Mammoth Cave,"Professional facilities, professional staff. The visitors' centre at MCNP is very new, and is a wonderfully welcoming place. Large, airy, with soaring beams in the ceiling, it gives you the sense of being an old but gracious mountain cabin. The Park staff are friendly and offering to help if you seem lost. The Guides know their stuff! They are knowledgeable, humorous and patient with questions.Be prepared: this is not a 20-minute ""pop-in-pop-out"" experience. And there is a lot of walking - a lot. And there are stairs and slopes, so if you have bad knees (like me), you'll have to pace yourself. But the Guides are great, they will accommodate you if you are a bit slower. I spent over 4 hours there, which allowed me 2 tours, and some ‘down-time’.$17 bought me 2 tours, and it’s well worth the money. I went on the 2 easiest tours, and I was bushed (though I am not in the best of shape). There are about a half-dozen or more different tours, and some are seasonal. Some are also quite strenuous, from what one staff member told us. And one even requires that you bring your own spelunking equipment. It’s worth it to visit the MCNP website in advance of your visit. Gives you some background on the tours.There’s a restaurant, but it’s basic diner fare. Several gift shops, and they are very nice, not ‘tacky’ at all. Lots of parking, close to the visitors’ centre – even on Sunday, it wasn’t crowded. There were a fair number of visitors (weekend), but not overwhelming. No line-ups, and the tours were very efficiently organized.The wilderness setting of this Park is gorgeous. The road in is beautiful, and the approach to the visitors’ centre gives you the impression you are about to experience a special place. MCNP is a testament to the U.S. National Park service.

I had wanted to take the Violet City Lantern Tour, but my husband did not feel confident enough in his bad ankles to do that tour which was deemed strenuous without any handrails or electric lighting. We enjoyed the historic tour much more than the Domes and Dripstones tour. The features of the Historic Tour were more appealing and the ranger on the Domes and Dripstones tour seemed too concerned with keeping schedule that she rushed everyone along so fast that we could not stop to take in and enjoy what we were walking by. I agree with a previous reviewer that Mammoth is not as jaw dropping as Carlsbad Caverns, but each cave is unique and has its own attributes. An overall enjoyable day.

Mammoth Cave,"First, I HIGHLY recommend reading the book _Journey to the Bottomless Pit_ (http://www.amazon.com/Journey-Bottomless-Pit-Stephen-Mammoth/dp/0670059080) before making the trip - for adults or kids. I read it with my four kiddos (ages 15, 13, 11, 7) before we took the Historic Tour, and it made a huge difference. They were so interested in seeing everything they had pictured in their minds and they really respected Stephen Bishop's intrepid nature.We were grateful to be able to change our tour time with no problems, and there were only about 40 people in our group, if that.You could easily spend days exploring all that this national park has to offer!Be aware that there are time differences in the area; we stayed in Elizabethtown (Eastern) and visited Lincoln's Birthplace (Eastern also), but Mammoth Cave is in the Central Time Zone.My only complaint is that the tour guide in front went so much faster than the middle of the group, there were features that we could have seen but there was no one there to point them out - and given that we were looking for specific things from the book, it was a bummer to know that we missed them.If you do take the Historic Tour, make sure to go see the video in the visitors' center that talks about exploration - they have an AWESOME 3-D video that shows you exactly the route you took, and it makes so much more sense then. :)","September 9, 2014",Check one off the bucket list!,75,"Orlando, Florida",4

Watch out for snakes! My feet glided right over a copperhead that was then spotted by my son. The park is really in the middle of nowhere. The on-site restaurant has a mid-century throwback menu. The alternative is to drive several miles to Cave City, and put up with late 20th century fast food.

Mammoth Cave,"If you have been to Colossal Cave, Carlsbad Caverns, etc., this will likely disappoint. Mammoth Cave is a very big cave and that is its claim to fame. Unfortunately, it is a ""dry"" cave, which means very few stalactites or stalagmites. It is not particularly convenient to get to. As a traveller who seeks out our National Parks, I would have to opine that this is more what one would expect of a State park, which is exactly what it was when Kentucky rescued it from over-commercialization by local hucksters. There are accommodation at the Park, but they are not what one would expect at a National Park. In fact, one of the buildings, which looks like a 1950's motel is to be torn down and not replaced.","September 8, 2014",Not Up To Standard,35,"Prescott, Arizona",2

We took the two hour Historic tour and had a good guide. This trip involved many steps ascending and descending. There was one low areas where one needed to bend down to walk and one fairly long area that was narrow and winding. A heavier person may have difficulty on this tour. It was classified as moderate and I would agree with that. Do wear shoes with good traction as many areas were bumpy and the low light made it difficult to see where you were walking.

We took the historic tour since that was suggested as the best one to start with. It was a two hour trek through tunnels through the rock with not a single stalactite or stalagmite or really much to be seen. There was little history given by our guide. Quite frankly, it was boring and we were glad when it was over. There are some places where the ceiling Is low and the going is tight, but we didn't have a problem.

Mammoth Cave,"Okay, this is going to be a long review, but I wish I had found a similar review before my trip to Mammoth Cave. So I'm going to be blunt with many things to do and NOT do! First of all, let me explain that I'm in my mid 30's and in fairly good physical shape, but I had knee surgery last year. I researched all of the tours ahead of time and despite the description of ""DOMES AND DRIPSTONES"" being a ""moderate"" tour, I thought I could do it. I know a lot of steps were listed, but I assumed it was a total number throughout the entire tour. Well....that was not the case. On the ""Domes & Dripstones"" tour, you literally descend into a man-made entrance. It used to be called the ""New Entrance"" tour. They blasted just enough of the cave away to make a TIGHT entrance that winds down into the deepest part of the cave at that particular spot. The steps were custom designed and I am not kidding when I say they were build around the rocks, so they twist and turn. If you're tall, you'll have to watch out or you'll bump your head. If you're not a 36 inch waist, you'll have to suck in at many places. I am only 5'4 and I'm not a big girl, but I found myself doing some crazy moves (ducking plus leaning my body backwards to avoid rocks from the top and the sides at the same time). If you have young kids, I have NO idea how you'll get down this staircase by carrying them. I would NOT recommend this tour for young children. The stairs are truly SINGLE FILE and that's pushing it at some places. Remember those 300 steps that are mentioned in the tour? Yeah, they're all at the beginning. OMG. And there are no breaks. Once you start down, you're in the line following the Ranger and you're expected to keep up.It is very muddy on this tour. Do NOT wear nice clothes because it is honestly impossible to not rub up against the muddy rocks at some point on that staircase. It is very wet on this tour. Do NOT bother styling your hair because you'll get big drops of water hitting you constantly. Also, be careful what you wear in case getting it wet will turn it into a see-through article of clothing.It is very slick on this tour. Do NOT wear fancy shoes, hills, or anything that doesn't have some major traction on the bottom. Those stairs are unbelievably wet and slick. There are handrails, but they are also wet and slick! One time, I almost fell and grabbed the handrail, but it just seemed to make me lose my balance even worse.I would highly recommend bringing gloves so that you can get some sort of grip on the handrails to keep yourself steady. I saw a man on our tour with gloves before we went in the cave and thought he was crazy. Nope, he was a genius. If you are the least bit claustrophobic or afraid of heights, you really might want to reconsider this tour. I am NOT claustrophobic OR afraid of heights, but I have to admit there were times when I was descending this massive staircase that I gasped because of the heights or felt like I couldn't breathe because I was in such a tight spot.There is no need to bring a camera. The descent down the staircase is fast and there's no time to stop. During the tour, it's too dark to take pictures and you CANNOT use a flash. Trust me when I say that if you do bring a camera, it's just going to get in your way and your pictures won't turn out anyway (happened to us).I know some people have said to bring a light jacket. Maybe if you are cold natured, but I was SWEATING after that staircase descent. Partially because of fear and partially because of the pain. It's in the 50's in the cave, but it's a humid feeling down there.Okay....now for the knee part. OMG. Like I said, I had knee surgery last year. Since then I've been very physically active and can easily walk 3+ miles on the treadmill or spend hours on the elliptical. Those stairs at the beginning kicked my butt. My knee turned into jelly. That led me to rely on my other leg, which caused me to sprain my ankle. I didn't think those stairs would ever end. I literally was trying to hold on to the handrails and hop down the stairs by the time I was near the bottom. After getting down the stairs, there are still a lot of inclines to navigate on the tour. I am okay going up a steep hill, but after wearing my knee out on the stairs, I had a hard time going down the steep inclines. WARNING - there are not handrails in all of the areas! I almost fell multiple times. Overall, it was definitely an experience I'll never forget. I'm glad I did it, but wouldn't do this same tour again! I had pain and soreness in my entire body for a week. We even cancelled the plans we had for the next day (Corvette museum) because we both struggled to get out of bed and walk! Hopefully this review will be helpful to those who have knee issues and are curious about this tour. :-)","September 3, 2014",Must read this review if you have knee issues!,500,"Crossville, Tennessee",5

For anyone who is an explorer, adventurer, interested in geology, or just plain curious this is a tour you should not miss.Even a as a boy I remember shapes, forms walls, floors, handrails, sounds, smells. It takes the phrase, ""going to ground,"" in a completely new direction. This is not a tour for the claustrophobic as you will most likely experience discomfort at the close quarters. But for those of us who love to see strange new worlds that make you stop, stare and wonder, this is a place for you.This place is largely wheelchair friendly and has hand rails for those who are not steady of foot. The guides are humorous, attentive and friendly. There are regular tours, as I remember that start every hour but run for about two hours. The hint at interest points held on other tours offered through Mammoth caves, but this main tour is definitely for the whole family. It is a bit of a walk so younger children who tire easily will most likely not enjoy this tour as much. Additionally younger children will need constant monitoring because there are several places that are ""Do Not Touch,"" and children often fail to realize and so need reminding.You will see wonderous rock formations, narrow corridors, learn geological facts that might amaze you. It is something that every member of my family talked about for weeks after our visit.","September 2, 2014",Journey To The Center of The Earth,20,"Denver, Colorado",5

Mammoth Cave,"We purchased tickets for the Domes and Dripstones Tour on a Sunday morning and had to wait about 2 hours before our tour. No problem, that gave us plenty of time to explore the visitor center - it had great displays with lots of information about the area, history and cave formations. Our kids (10, 8, 6, and 2) all enjoyed walking through this mini-museum.This tour has a LOT of stairs and carrying a two year old was a little bit of a challenge. Our 6 year old who was still a little tired from the drive there was not thrilled with all the steps, but she made it. Our 8 and 10 year old girls were up for the challenge and were happy to be on an 'adventure'. The Frozen Niagra formation was gorgeous, as was most of the second half of the tour (the first half was just a lot of stairs). Next trip we will probably take a more laid back tour, but the cave is amazing and we're glad we went to visit!","September 2, 2014",Nice cave with a great visitor center.,3,Seymour,4
Mammoth Cave,"This cave is a great cave to visit in Kentucky. We took the historic tour which was 2 hours long. I loved learning the history of the cave from our very knowledgable guide. I am claustrophobic so I am a little skeptical going into caves, but our guide explained the passages before we began and we saw a map in the visitor's center as well so I was well prepared. The tour was so interesting and the walk through was perfect. They have many tours from which to choose, and my husband and I are anxious to return to take the lantern tour where guests carry lanterns and explore the cave by lantern light. We have visited several caves throughout our travels, but Mammoth Cave is the best we have visited yet. For an even better experience stay overnight in the park to extend the beauty of the area.","September 2, 2014",Wonderful cave to visit!,37,"Englewood, Florida",5

Mammoth Cave,"Visited on Labor Day weekend. Please reserve your tours ahead of time. When I got there to pick up my tickets, I noticed almost all the tours were fully booked for the entire day. In the morning we did the historic tour. Our tour guide Alan was great. He had great stories to share at each stop along the tour. When you first walk into the cave, you walk for a fair bit before coming to a stop. This gave me the misconception that we just walked the entire time at our own pace and I was annoyed the guides didn't tell us anything. Don't be alarmed. The guides will stop occasionally at appropriate places to share stories.In the afternoon we did the domes & dripstone tour. The entrance of this tour is at the site of a sink hole. It looked and felt like a scene from Jurassic Park when they had to go to a remote power station to turn the power on. We were all funneled down this concrete enclosed staircase for the first couple hundred steps before the concrete gives way to steel staircases that spiral down the cave. It was interesting. Near the end of the tour you see some really neat formations.I'd recommend both tours as part of the Mammoth Cave experience.","September 1, 2014",Cave tours,24,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",4

Mammoth Cave,"The cave was an excellent weekend trip; it provided an escape from the summer heat as well as the opportunity to see some underground history.What you learn on the tour will blow your mind and as you go deeper and deeper into the cave you will just become engulfed in how beautiful the rock formations are; I would suggest doing this with at least two people just to have a buddy since the tours themselves are rather large.In order to get the best experience I would take a more advanced tour such as the Violet City Lantern Tour or Grand Avenue Tour, but the Historic Tour is nice too...only problem is it leaves you wanting to see more.","August 30, 2014",Best cave tour,94,"Nashville, Tennessee",4

Mammoth Cave,"Visited with my 11yr old son.We camped 4 nights and took 3 different cave tours. All 3 were great. The only issue was on our last tour. We had an all adult family who were very disrespectful of others. They were using flash photography (we were told often this was not allowed) & were using a flash light. Due to the nature of a cave tour, using a flashlight blinds others. We were being allowed to experience the cave's total darkness for a bit- but Mr. Flashlight was too busy playing with his flashlight. I felt it was the tour guide' s responsibility to enforce the rules but they did not. At the end of the tour other tourists finally yelled at him and he put it away. Other than that we loved our stay here. Best campground ever! Clean bathrooms and shower with Laundry close by!","August 29, 2014",Great vacation!,1,,5
Mammoth Cave,"I did the Historic Cave Tour with my wife, two year old, and four month old. Having never been here before, the Historic Cave Tour was definitely the way to go. It gave us ""the big picture"" of the cave, and whet our appetite for a future visit to see some of the other tours.Now, some people on our tour were pretty upset. Thus, things you should know BEFORE entering the cave:- The historic tour is two miles and two hours, plan accordingly.- Wear clothes that can get mud on them.- Some people brought little flashlights to shine in dark crevices in the cave. I wish I had done that!- There are something like 200 steps down and 500 steps up. You have been warned.- This cave is not famous for it's fancy decorations, there is not a stalactite or stalagmite to be seen throughout. No part of the cave will make you gasp in awe at the beauty that surrounds you. It's all grey and brown rock with some dark mud thrown in for decoration.- This cave is famous for being really BIG, it has 400+ miles of discovered passages. It's awesome to see two miles of them, but few people ever get the feel of 400+ miles of passages.- Nevertheless, it's famous for it's length, not necessarily the size of it's rooms or passageways. Tall people will need to spend a good amount of time ducking.- What this cave lacks in pretty, it makes up for in a very interesting history. Conveying that requires a lot of talking by the rangers. A tour will include much talking and not a ton of scenery. I found our guide fascinating, and the long history of the cave fascinating, but many people on the tour were dissapointed.- The rangers warn people about tight squeezes and low ceilings. While I found the warnings to be overstated, I don't have a problem with either tight spaces or ducking (or hitting my head, which I managed once).Now that I got that out of the way, I loved this tour! The history is fascinating, the tough spots to navigate were the fun spots, my two year old had a blast navigating through some of the crazy parts (but he is a very active toddler who viewed it as a game) and can hike three miles at a time. The ranger made the whole thing work, and we were lucky to only have 40 people on our tour (the tour fits more than 100 usually), so we got to do some things that weren't part of ""the regular"". My only minor gripe is that there was no regrouping at the bottom of the stairs at the beginning of the tour. We had a toddler and were behind some slower people. When we got to the bottom, we realized the tour had blasted ahead without regrouping. We caught up and were fine for the rest of the tour (the pace wasn't bad once you were in the group), but some of the other folks with us were struggling for a while.","August 28, 2014",Great guide (Historic Cave Tour)!,171,South Jersey,4
Mammoth Cave,"This was a return trip for our family. The visitor's center is beautifully remodeled, and the energy conservation/sustainability efforts did not detract from the center. Our first tour was the Historic Tour. Our tour guide was passionate and memorable. The two-hour, two-mile tour flew by. The second tour we took was Domes and Dripstones which enters through a man-made entrance. There are 280 stairs going down, so if you have a hard time with stairs, don't take this tour. The stair descent is one of the cool parts of the tour, but because it is at the beginning of the tour, you don't have time to pause and enjoy it.The tour groups are really big and if you are in the middle of the group, you will not hear everything that the tour guide points out.Wear comfortable shoes that will allow you to walk fast without worrying about slipping. Don't bother taking pictures because they will be dark or blurry. If you plan to go really slow or carry your baby, stay at the back so that the rest of the tour group can keep up with the front tour guide.","August 27, 2014",Historic Tour & Domes & Dripstones Tour,74,"Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin",5

At one point (when we were all in a safe, open area) he turned out the lantern so that we could get an idea of what it would have been like in the cave when they were digging it out. Pitch black.

Mammoth Cave,"Unfortunately we were on a road trip of many sites and only allowed time for a day visit. This place is truly huge, well, MAMMOTH. We only had time for one of the tours. The Park Ranger giving the tour was very informative and well spoken. It should be noted that since the cave tours are of course, CAVE TOURS, it is quite physical. The advice given was, as far down as we go is the same distance we must climb out. Therefore, if you are not up to keeping up with the tour, think about doing one of the other activities in the park...the tours are on a time schedule. The cave is much cooler than the outside air temp. If you have never been to a cave, this is a good one to start with. I asked about creepy crawly things in the cave and the ranger stated that since nothing lives down in the cave, there is no food source for other animals to venture in to get. There are bats and recently they have had some issues with them-new restrictions on some clothing that can be worn. This is a must do...but plan ahead - the national park service website is great for planning.","August 27, 2014",CORRECTLY NAMED!,43,"Sanford, Florida",5

Big cave with some of the typical dripstone features and history. Cool at 54 degrees down there but we welcomed that refreshing tour on a very hot and humid August day.

We rolled the dice thinking we were visiting mid-week and therefore didn't need to sign up for tours and we were sadly mistaken. Thankfully, we were able to get the last four tickets (24-hrs in advance) in person for the Violet City cave tour which was phenomenal thanks to terrific, entertaining, informative guides Bob (!) and Rick. Wow what a great tour. Thought we loved the Violet City cave tour, we equally loved Domes and Dripstones so put that on your must-do list. The only other tour we were able to do was the Historic Tour which was pretty good but not as good as the aforementioned tours in my opinion.

Mammoth Cave," Okay, first off, this area is in the CENTRAL time zone. We were hauling from Louisville to try to get here on time for the last tour of the day. When we arrived, we found out we were 58 minutes early, instead of 2 minutes late! Our GPS all of the sudden, lost an hour, and we were sure it was malfunctioning. Anyways, on to the caves. Lots of different tours. Most of them were family friendly, although we only had time for one. Very nice facility, nice visitor center while you are waiting for your tour.  Best footwear is some type of covered toe shoe with traction. There are some sloping rocky areas (duh) that you are trudging through, but very clean and dry, at least our tour was. Loved the history of the caves as told by the rangers. They stop the tour often for photos and history talks. Like I said, can't compare to other caves, since I had never been, but this seemed like a good starter cave experience. It just so happened to be the largest cave complex in North America.","August 24, 2014","Neat experience, never caved before",10,Plano,5
Mammoth Cave,"Cave Tours:Grand Avenue (4 hours, moderately strenuous): We had Matt, he was great, and this tour covers many of the others. Only offered on Sat/Sun. No snack/food stop (snowball dining room under construction), but 2 bathroom stops. Super cool!Domes and Dripstones: Part of this is covered in the Grand Avenue tour, but not the beginning, which is going down 230 steps through the 7 domes. It was AWESOME! Our guide was excellent, David I think, 2014 Tour Guide of the Year,Star Chamber Lantern Tour: We were excited b/c this one entered through the only ""natural"" entrance to Mammoth Cave (the other 2 tours entered through different man made entrances). This did not overlap w/ other 2 tours at all & so was also super awesome! Terry was our tour guide, very good, and we saw the two TB huts, the Giant's Coffin, Register Hall. So neat to only be lit by lanterns too!We also did some hiking. D/t weather we only could do this on our last day in btwn tours (so for 2-3 hours). I had read other reviews for good trails, etc. I remembered reading about the Echo River trail near the Green River Ferry, and so almost by accident we found this. The ferry itself was cool to see/watch, not what I expected. The Echo River trail is pretty short, and actually is where the Echo River, which runs underground through the caves, comes above ground. Super cool! We also continued hiking on some other trails back there, all pretty easy/short, probably would have been a good idea to spray bug spray. I really wanted to find a ""walking stick"" bug, and was so excited when we actually did!I went as a child to Mammoth, and such an incredible experience to go back & really experience it again. The park rangers are so knowledgeable, we learned so much, and the entire experience at Mammoth Park was simply AMAZING!","August 24, 2014",AWESOME!,15,,5

Mammoth Cave,"By flash I mean not flashing the passerby but flash photography. We've been to many caves in America, including National Parks and Monuments, and this is the only one so far that prohibits flash photography. And it's not mentioned anywhere online when you look the place up - you learn about it from the tour guide at the beginning of the tour, after you buy the tickets and there is no way out: that's a rude awakening for you. They have pretty good formations, but they're poorly lit: the cave actually mentions that they don't want to over-emphasize them. I would still visit the cave if I knew in advance about no flash, but the trip was almost ruined by this unexpected ""welcome"".","August 22, 2014",The only cave so far where flash is not allowed,41,"Madison, Wisconsin",2

Mammoth Cave,"We took the Grand Ave. Tour and the Star Chamber Tour. The Grand Ave. is 4 miles with a LOT of stairs, but if you are physically fit this tour will give you a good overall view of the cave's size and variety. We just happened to get a Ranger who thought we were on a forced march and got finished about 20 minutes early....just hope you get a Ranger that will set a more reasonable pace. This tour also includes the Snowball Dining Room, but they no longer serve food. We were told they were working on the elevators and planning on reopening, but there did not appear to be any construction happening either in the dining room or on the surface....so who knows when, if ever, it will reopen. This saddens me....it is one of the best memories I have of the cave when I was a child. The Star Chamber Tour, in our opinion, is a must do. With the exception of a few stairs, it is an easy and leisurely walk and seeing the cave by lantern light is awesome. ","August 20, 2014",Truly Mammoth,125,,5
Mammoth Cave,"As a child I went to Mammoth Caves. I enjoyed it so much that over twenty years later I wanted my husband and children to experience this too. So, on Saturday we visited. The Domes and Dripstones tour was fascinating and educational. It lasted two hours and involved a lot of steps as we descended into the cave. Much of the tour has rather tight spaces, which is to be expected. The lighting is dim and the air seems pure. The temperature is between 50 - 60 degrees. I wore long pants and long sleeve t-shirt but considering the amount of stairs and climbing, I could have worn a short-sleeve shirt. Our favorite part were the stalactites and stalagmites: the Frozen Niagara and the Drapery Room are beautiful illustrations of these phenomena. As a sidenote, the Mammoth Cave National Park as a whole is a beautiful, well-kept park with various attractions and a polite, informative staff. We were very happy with our experience.","August 19, 2014",Domes and Dripstones Tour,2,"Grand Rapids, Michigan",4
Mammoth Cave,"We went down to Mammoth Cave in July of 2013. The oil lamp tour is an excellent compliment to any of the other tours. The tour is all about what the tours were like 150 - 200 years ago. You carry oil lanterns and the docents shut the lights off as you go through. I am 6' 8"" tall and had no issues with claustrophobia. There are lots of large open spaces where you frequently stop. There are brief periods when you are in confined spaces. But, those are short in duration.","August 19, 2014",Awesome trip,11,"Pinckney, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave is amazing. We took the historic tour and found it entertaining, enlightening and educational. if you have been to other caves, this one is a little different. Not just because of its immense size, but there is something majestic and historical about it that differs from others. The Visitor's Center is well-done (I wish the museum were larger) and I wish it had more of the history represented. Our guide was good, but seemed a little rote and a little too sure of himself, but enjoyable nonetheless. You should go here at least once in a lifetime. We plan to go again.","August 19, 2014",Wow!

We took the Historical Tour, a 2-hour hike through some of the best known areas of the cave system. The tour was incredible and it only wet our appetite for coming back at a future time to explore their other tours; there are so many. Go early in the morning if you want to avoid the big crowds. After the tour, we were starving and, instead of driving back to Cave City, we decided to eat lunch at the Mammoth Cave Hotel Restaurant.

The Mammoth burgers are very tasty and reasonably priced.","August 18, 2014",Amazing!,53,Maryland,5
Mammoth Cave,"Traveling South from Louisville to Nashville we determined that we only had time for a short visit and one cave tour. We selected the Domes and Dripstones tour both for the length of time and the start time. The cost was reasonable and the difficulty moderate though that wasn't an issue for us. The length of our tour was 3/4 of a mile meandering up and down through passages and caverns. We saw a variety of domes , pits , stalactites and stalagmites. One of the highlights was the feature called the frozen Niagara, a spectacular drip stone display. Our Ranger guide was very informative and a long time employee who obviously enjoyed her work and interaction with the diverse tour group. We took a lot of pictures which didn't turn out too well due to the limitations of our phone camera - should have had a better camera. There are 400 miles of caves and 70 miles of topside trails.

Mammoth Cave,"We were on a rushed schedule, so only spent 3 hours in the park, but we were glad we went. We took the Domes and Dripstones tour and were pleased. I bought tickets online 2 days ahead for the 8:45 - when I made the reservation there were 100 of 114 tickets available - I'm guessing there were about 60 on the tour, so it appears most people buy their tickets onsite. If you have a specific timeslot you are trying to fill, probably should reserve in advance, as I noticed several of even the larger later AM tours sold out early, even though available online a day earlier. Also, some of the smaller, less frequent tours sell out online as well.The tour was graded as moderate, and I think that is accurate. I would be more concerned about those with bad knees or hips, or with cardiopulmonary issues, less so than fear of heights or claustrophobia. And an obese person with shortness of breath would have trouble. Finally, no bathroom availability for 2 plus hours. They give you plenty of warning right before the tour, but keep those things in mind as your planning - no vats of coffee for us on that morning.It's hard not to be impressed with the caves themselves and the enormity of them on this tour. Your see a variety of terrains, and the ranger was good in explaining everything in a comfortable pace. There are several opportunities to sit down and listen while they talk. The 2 hour tour includes a 10-minute back and forth ride from the visitor center, so about 90 minutes in the cave itself - seemed like about the right amount.No hesitation in recommending this to anybody without any of the aforementioned physical concerns.","August 17, 2014",Worth the Trip,68,"Omaha, Nebraska",5
Mammoth Cave,"This is an amazing place to be, one of the most beautiful places on earth! Or under it! We took the historic tour, witch they say it's moderate. It was 2 hours long, but we had 3-4 stops inside and a little history about the cave. Very interesting! Especially the moment when they turned off the lights and you could really feel what the first explorers felt. This cave it's huge, that's why they call it ""mammoth cave"", more than 400 miles and a lot to be still discovered.

Mammoth Cave,"We took the historic tour at 10:45 with 2 adults, 2 teenagers, and 1 5 year old. The person that sold the tickets was rude and you could tell he didn't care about being there. We went to a covered shelter behind the tourism site to have the tour explained and then off we went. We did have to do a bit of walking before the tour to get to the cave and after the tour to get us back to our starting point. We all had to gather around the guide/ranger and listen to the rules before the tour. There were 133 people gathered around her (we were just about in a single file line) I have no idea what she said most of the time. Once we were on our tour we made frequent stops to listen to the historical facts about the area we were viewing- again 133 people and sometimes I had no idea what the guide was saying. She told everyone that the slower people should move up front and we did (5 year old daughter takes a while to walk). It was annoying having to wait for the majority of the group as they were taking selfies while we were keeping up with the tour. At one point the guide had to tell them to stop taking pics and keep walking. There is a portion of this tour where it is completely dark to show what it was like when the original settlers came into the cave (your standing listening to info and the guide shuts off all the lights and blows out the lantern). We stood in pitch black for at least 5 minutes while every kid in the tour cried- parents beware. The stairs weren't too bad, I am not the most athletic person and I did fine. There are no obvious stalactites or stalagmites on this tour. One man even asked why there weren't any, the guide said there were but they were very small and hard to notice. If you are purposely coming to see stalactites and stalagmites this is not your tour. There is no bathroom and you can't leave on your own, so if a young child has to go they have to hold it! It was a nice experience, I just wish we didn't have to keep waiting for the others in our group.","August 15, 2014",Great educational experience,22,"Lombard, Illinois",4
Mammoth Cave,If you are planning a trip.....and want to see the caves with all you can imagine in an underground cave....do not plan on the self guided tour. $17 for 6 people.....and entrance to the 4th largest cavern however it is a quick 3/4 of a mile.....less than 30 minutes and that is if you walk very slowly.

Mammoth Cave,"So we took the Mammoth Passage tour. Our guide Ranger Cory was amazing. He made it fun, and exciting for our kids yet interesting for the adults. Great short tour. Not hard to hike. The rangers at the info desk who helped my kids become Jr Rangers were friendly. Super clean park, great gift shops, tons of activities. Go enjoy nature!

Mammoth Cave,"We recently visited Mammoth Cave for a half day. Our family of 6 enjoyed the Historic Tour of the cave. It was a lot of fun. Our youngest child is 6 and had no problem keeping up on the 2 hour, 2 mile long tour. We were glad we brought pants and jackets, as the cave is quite chilly. Next time we go, we plan to make reservations and do the 4 hour long Grand Avenue Tour. It was worth seeing and we will be back!","August 13, 2014",Family Fun,63,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"We took the Historic Tour of the cave. It has many steps including 150ish up a fire tower. I am not in very good physical shape, but was able to make the 2 hour trip. It was hard though and wouldn't recommend it if you have difficulty with steps. The rangers keep moving at a good pace. I found the most difficulty I had was being able to see the grade of the path. It is dimly lit but walking along the path was a bit scary because I couldn't see well in the darkness. I didn't expect that because I have been to Mammoth Cave before several times, but it was over 20 years ago. So my recommendation is that if you have difficulty seeing at night, consider whether this is the trip for you. It's a great tour and the rangers are very knowledgable and helpful. I probably won't do the tour again, but only because of my poor night vision","August 13, 2014",Exploring in a safe atmosphere,8,Louisville,4
Mammoth Cave,"My wife and I did 3 tours over the course of a weekend back in March: Historic, Domes and Dripstones, and Star Chamber. We wanted to do the Violet City and perhaps the Wild Cave Tour, but these get quickly booked up weeks/sometimes months in advance, so plan accordingly.The Historic and Domes/Dripstones tours are the most popular tours, yet run so often that it is possible to walk up and purchase tickets. Tickets are reasonably priced at about $10-12 a person with a duration of about 2 hours. There is some physical exertion required, but it mostly involves ascending staircases(often quite narrow) - a bigger concern is making certain you do not hit your head on rocks jutting overhead. The guides will usually lead you to a point of importance, give some description, then advise the group to rendezvous at the next point(usually an area with some benches to rest). A fair amount of walking is involved with each tour.The Historic Tour begins at the visitor center before descending a moderately steep hill to a large entrance. A walkway leads to a large room called ""The Rotunda"" before taking you deeper into the caves and eventually leading to memorable areas such as ""Fat Man's Misery"". This tour gives you a pretty good idea of just how immense the caves are and the park rangers who lead the tour are fantastic in their enthusiasm and subject matter knowledge. Most of Mammoth Caves is pretty much entwined, small passageways of mostly smooth rock which all look pretty similar after awhile.Which makes the Domes and Dripstones Tour even more memorable since this tour really provides a great deal of variety of geologic features, oddities, and breathtaking moments which are absent from the rest of the caves. Frozen Niagara really needs to be seen to be believed, as does the ""Drapery Room"" next to it. Turn a corner and you are promised something new. I would rank this the best of the 3 tours we did just for the sheer entertainment of all the different rock formations you'll encounter. The Star Chamber Tour was a bit of a disappointment, though. A night-time tour requiring lanterns carried into the cave sounded very appealing and intriguing. The first half hour covers the same ground as the Historic Tour before moving on to a different part of the cave; eventually you encounter Star Chamber, a small room with a ceiling which is supposed to look very much like the evening sky with a few bits of exposed rock which look like stars. The optical illusion does exist, but seems like a cheap thrill, especially considering the illusion of ""stars"" was created by cave guides of yesteryear. The story of the doctor treating tuberculosis patients in the caves and the sight of their crumbling simple dwellings, especially by lantern light, was kind of creepy and the most entertaining part of the tour. The Park Ranger was very enthusiastic and tried her best, but the tour itself was kind of bland.All the tours originate from the Visitor Center and everything is very well-organized. There is no entrance fee to the park, just the price of the tours. Besides the caves, there are also some hiking trails on the surface which take you to overlooks of the Green River, sinkholes, and other parts of the Kentucky countryside which probably look very scenic during the summer(we saw it in early springtime when the trees had not yet bloomed).When visiting this part of Kentucky, keep in mind it's pretty rural. Dining options are limited to mostly fast food and outside of the caves, most entertainment options are low-fare tourist traps(animal farms and a dinosaur park for kids, for instance). The good news is that prices are pretty low in this part of the country, including hotel accommodations.","August 13, 2014","Great Variety of Tours and Some Scenery, Too",198,Chicago,5

Mammoth Cave,"We went on the Historic Tour as well as the Domes and Dripstones Tour. Both were amazing and each offered something different to see. The highlight of the Historic tour is fat man's misery immediately followed by tall man's misery. The Domes and Dripstones tour features the frozen Niagara. Both tours were approximately 2 hours, and the tour guides are very knowledgeable about the cave system. Mammoth Cave is a must for everyone to see!!

Mammoth Cave,"To think that this was the second national park, behind Niagara, (according to Ranger Jacob), it's impressive. What a space. It's hard to imagine that you can have such large caves underground. We did the Historic Tour, which was insightful and the right length (about 2 hours). Don't fear Fat Man's Misery or the climb back up to the surface... not as bad as the Rangers let on. I wish that we had done more research before visiting, because the other tours seemed to be very interesting as well. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the cave that cold, as it is normally 55oF. It was a great change from the high humid 80s outside. One note in planning... if driving south from Louisville, be aware that you cross into Central Time, before getting to the Caves... that means you might arrive an hour earlier than you expected. All told, simply amazing. We showed up and caught the 8:45, but by the time we had returned to the visitor's centre (about 11:00), a lot of tours had already sold out.","August 11, 2014",A great visit to an amazing place.,169,"Toronto, Canada",5
Mammoth Cave,"The visitor center, with a tiny museum, is free. There are several optional tours. This time, we took Domes and Dripstones. We had a ""smaller"" group for an August weekend, only 100 or so. Buses pick the tour members up at the visitor's center and drop us off outside the cave entrance used for this tour. The beginning of the tour is a sharp descent, with 250 stairs. You can only go single file, and additionally have to stoop, twist and squeeze a bit. After that descent, we twist through a narrow, mostly horizontal passage called ""the Subway"" to reach ""Grand Central Station."" Here, there are benches to sit on while you wait for everyone to catch up, and the ranger answers any and all questions. The tour then continues up a very steep ramp with 50+ stairs, and winds it's way through somewhat more spacious passages until it gets to Niagara, which is very near the end of the tour, so don't be afraid to do the 48 extra steps to descend into Niagara. Rangers were courteous and knowledgeable.","August 11, 2014",Domes and Dripstones,3,"Lexington, KY",4
Mammoth Cave,"We've passed by Mammoth cave a million times and finally made it our destination. We were not disappointed. We spent a day there and took two tours (as recommended by fellow trip advisor reviewers). We did the Historic tour at 10am (for two hours) and then had lunch. Then we did the Domes and Drip Stones tour at 2pm (for two hours.) This was a perfect day. We had lunch at the hotel restaurant (which was ok) but there wasn't really anything else local (that I know of.) The tours were really good. Try to stay up near the front so you can talk to the tour guide while you walk. My 9 year old daughter stayed interested the the whole time. if you are going during peak time (school vacations), be sure to buy tickets online in advance.","August 10, 2014",Gotta go,89,"ATL, GA",5

Mammoth Cave,Took the Domes and Dripstones tour which was great. Its two hours and 500 stairs. Our kids 5 and 2 did fine. The youngest did have to be carried down the stairs which is very tight. I recommend also taking the self guided tour (discovery) and making reservations.,"August 9, 2014",Domes and Dripstones Tour,16,,5
Mammoth Cave,"Our first day we did the Historic tour which enters the cave thru the natural entrance. It was a good introduction to the cave and it's history. In the evening we did the Star Chamber tour which is a tour of the cave by lantern. 40 people and 10 lanterns. It was our favorite tour! Our second day we did the Domes & Dripstones tour which enters the cave thru a man made entrance going down a lot of narrow stairs. All of these tours covered different areas of the cave with very little overlap. We enjoyed all of them. I strongly recommend booking your tours in advance especially for the evening tours which sell out. Even though you book your tour online and pay at the time you make your reservation and get a printed receipt with a bar code, it's not your ticket. You still have to wait in the ticket line at the Visitors Center and exchange your bar coded receipt for another ticket, which makes no sense (my only complaint about the whole visit). We also hiked several of the trails above the cave. We stayed at the Mammoth Cave Hotel which made it very easy to fit a lot of activities into a weekend.","August 9, 2014",Wish I'd had time to see more!,24,"Newark, Delaware",5
Mammoth Cave,"We did the Discovery tour first. It was interesting but mostly the ranger talking about things we had already read at the visitor center. We did not venture very far into the cave, OK at best. The Historic tour is great, you see everything on the Discovery tour and much more. The Frozen Niagara was also great, A+. We also did the Sand Cave Almanac tour, you use your car to travel to sites while the ranger fills in the story. Geared more towards adults. We loved it and would rate it as one of our best tours. A tragic true story and you get to go into parts of the park that are closed off to the public. Always wanted to see Mammoth cave and wished we would have done it earlier. Tips: we took a cooler and food for lunch but finding a picnic table is hard. The day use area at Dennison Ferry is a long drive and not maintained very well. A better option are the tables at Sloans Crossing. Park brochures show all this. Food at the park is expensive, service is slow and lines form quickly.","August 8, 2014",Two days at Mammoth,13,Michigan,5
Mammoth Cave,We went on the historic tour. We had not made advanced reservations unfortunately. This tour was two plus hours and well worth it. The park service guide was knowledgeable and had a great sense of humor to educate over 100 tourists.

Nice job USPS. ,"August 7, 2014",What a cave to behold!!,440,"Vancouver, Canada",5
Mammoth Cave,"We did the Domes and Dripstones tour, which as the name suggests is a ranger-led tour through both the dome and Frozen Niagara regions of the cave. To be honest, I found the domes portion awfully boring. If you've toured any other caves, there just isn't anything that really sets it apart. However, the Frozen Niagra region is very interesting as it is full of stalactites and stalagmites. If I were to do it again, I would just do the Frozen Niagra tour or maybe a tour of a different part of the cave.","August 7, 2014","Domes are boring, but dripstones are awesome",78,"New Albany, Ohio",4
Mammoth Cave,"This was my second time in Mammoth Cave. This time, I had my two boys with me. It was an interesting journey, underground. I have been to several other caves; this cave is more about the history and the route that you take... with some nice natural features and several challenges in the route (my favorite: ""Fat Man's Misery""). My son's seemed to enjoy our time there and I want to point out that there is a LOT to do in the surrounding area as well... just beware of the tourist trap type places; or if you go to them... be aware of what they are. Do a little internet research before you go, and plan what you want to do before you get there. Keep an open mind too - and you'll have a great time. Solid spot to visit, best as part of a larger trip.","August 6, 2014",Largest Cave system in the World; interesting walk underground,43,"Independence, Missouri",4
Mammoth Cave,"We went through the museum at the visitor's center and discovered how massive Mammoth Cave really is. They are still connecting it with many cave systems in the area. We then went on our planned Domes and Dripstones Tour (that was previously called the New Entrance Tour). The literature on this called it a ""moderate"" tour. I am not necessarily in shape, but this tour kicked my butt. My upper legs and thighs didn't feel right for a week after going down the initial set of steps and going through the cave. That being said, the scenery was wonderful. It was amazing to see the waterfalls all over the place and the dripstone formations. It culminated in the Frozen Niagara area. There are times where you can take this part of the tour by itself. So if you do not want to take a long tour, you should just come to this short tour because this rock waterfall of the Frozen Niagara is something to see.After going on this tour, we had lunch at the little restaurant and then walked to the entrance of the Historic Tour cave. There were many steps going down to this one and you could walk all the way up to the door and look in.I had passed Mammoth Cave many times before on the Interstate, but finally glad I took the time to stop and take a tour.","August 6, 2014",Lots to See and Do at Mammoth Cave,135,"Crossville, Tennessee",4

My wife has walking issues due to knee replacement, metal foot parts, hip and back issues, etc.Their website was very informative, all info was there, although not very user friendly... giving all the available tours (days and times), fees, length of tour,degree of difficulty and the number of steps on each tour.While one tour had as few as 12 steps, (it was unavailable), most all of the others had hundreds! 700 steps, I believe was the most!We opted out of taking any cave tour. Note: there are many handicap accessible activities available,just not any cave tours.We used the rest rooms, viewed some displays, and visited the gift shop.We purchased a Mammoth Cave, combo book and DVD package (under $30) and left.Hopefully, we will get the cave experience without all the steps and associated aches and fatigue.","August 6, 2014",Too many steps...,17,"Somerset, Kentucky",3

I think you could spend a week hear there are many tours to go on and the beauty of the caves is amazing. We did the drips and flow stones and you climb down these small ladders into the cave, I kept thinking how did they get the steel walk ways in place. The guide was very good and we went on about a 2 hour tour. Have to go back, The pasages can be short or tight when walking.

Mammoth Cave,This was an wonderful adventure. This was my second visit. My last was over 12 years ago. Since then they have opened a new interactive visitor center. Well worth visiting before entering the cave. Great activity to do while waiting for my tour. We walked right up without a reservation and only had to wait 45 mins to get our tour. We were very lucky. Would highly recommend reserving tours in advance. There are many to choose from. Recommend close toed trail shoes and a light jacket. Not recommended for anyone who cannot climb steps or who are over weight. Passage ways are very narrow & had many low ceilings. Nothing is allowed in cave except water bottles. I would not recommend kids under 6. There were 4 preschoolers on our tour that parents had to carry most of the way and held up the large group to climbs steps.Plus it was hard to hear tour guide because preschoolers were not able to keep quiet.Only negative was I feel groups are too large.

Count yourself lucky if you get a tour with him. He is a great story-teller, and cracks jokes left and right that are genuinely funny.The next morning we took the Grand Avenue tour with Ranger Thomas, who is also a very interesting guide with great stories, although he is more earnest and less goofy than Ranger Rick. Believe it when the tour is labeled ""strenuous."" The Park Service does mean it: we did 4 miles in 4 hours, which sounds slow-paced but isn't really. One mile is continuous single-file through a narrow and tall canyon. Additionally there are three ""mountains"" to be ascended and descended, with many steep parts both up and down. The mountains really are vast, as are the canyons. It is incredible to find such spaces underground. We went at a fairly good pace through it all. Both tours were fantastic. Mammoth Cave is all-around amazing! And the Park Service does a terrific job of show-casing its wonders.","August 3, 2014","Great walks, amazing tours",33,"Princeton, NJ",5

Actually all of the tours were sold out when we arrived at 2:00 but we lucked out and they opened up an extra tour that evening because of the high demand that day.

Did the Domes and Dripstones tour, one of the shorter tours as far as distance (3/4 of a mile), takes about 2 hours, but it was really neat. We got tickets ahead of time so we could be on the first tour of the day, which was nice because it wasn't totally full, better with a smaller group in my opinion. Ranger Sue gave great information, really enjoyed her talk as we went through and she had answers for the many questions that were asked. Definitely worth a visit and we're looking forward to coming back.

The Historic tour is a good intro, and it's not totally easy (it's long, there are many steps, and some smallish twisting passages). One elderly woman had to be taken back part way through the tour - for anyone over 50 it's a workout.We were there late morning on a weekday, and while there were spaces on all the historic tours, all of the specialty tours were sold out.

Mammoth Cave,"Spent 4 days in KY exploring the national park and surrounding attraction. Even though there is an abundance of attractions nearby, each day we did something different in the park, whether it was a hike or a tour. Due to scheduling, I wasn't able to book the Grand Avenue Tour since it was only available on the weekend, but was able to take the Historic, Domes & Dripstones and Violet City Lantern tour. All of the tours were amazing and showed a different part of the cave...when it came to the Lantern tour, it showed a cave in a different way all together. It has been a while since I have been captivated and completely awed by something but a trip to Mammoth Cave has done just that. The rangers that led the various tours were enlightening and entertaining on different levels which added to the overall experience. This is a crown jewel in the NPS and they show why time and time again they are in charge of the countries most valuable pieces of land. You won't find anyone complaining about the cost, but some may complain about the rules. I too was confused and upset about the ""no flash"" until I learned how much more enjoyable it was not having the person behind you taking pics and ruining your night vision in the cave. My wish is that other caves would adopt this rule as too many people are inconsiderate. Speaking of inconsiderate...people need to think twice about bringing their screaming child on a tour. If the child cannot keep quiet, is afraid of the dark and doesn't listen to you do everyone in the group a favor and save us the agony of dealing with your problem.My recommendation to any NPS employee...stick with the ""no flash rule"", offer more tours if possible (I want to see more of the cave!!!) and restrict access to specific ages. I recommend to other visitors to plan on visiting the cave and park itself...not just stopping by on the way to someplace else.

Hiking around is so-so, not much to see and hot and humid during July. Also some of the trails are on the north side of the park; and takes a hour and a half to drive over there, when the Green River crossing ferry is not running due to low water level.

Mammoth Cave,"we decided to tour the mammoth cave to on our way home from a family reunion. i love caves i have visited natural bridge caverns in texas and was expecting something similar. my kids are 2yrs and 3 yrs, my husband and i are in pretty good shape so i figured we could just carry them through the cave no problem. we took the domes and dripstones tour and i was not expecting such steep and narrow staircases. wow it was narrow had to carry the kids directly in front of us, not on back or on hip due to low ceilings and very narrow passages. whatever that didn't bother me too much, i kept waiting for the beautiful stalagmites and stalactites, white glowing wet looking formations, stuff you would normally see in a cave. this is not that sort of cave. it's just a bunch of rocks, not visually impressive at all. there weren't even bats. at the very end of the tour (which took forever and was so crowded with a million other sight seers) there is the frozen niagra formation which is brown and dead and not impressive. oh well. i'm sure the surrounding park is pretty, but we didn't have time to hike or anything. glad we tried it out though, otherwise i wouldn't have known.","July 29, 2014",not for toddlers,18,"Plano, Texas",1
Mammoth Cave,"I will start with a bad part of my Mammoth Caves trip : Only one Self-guided tour , and that lasts for less than an hour !Don't plan to visit this place without any prior reservations for tours , unless you wanted to drive all the way into Kentucky with no reason. There's of course a convincing reason for this. Mammoth Caves are so vast that anyone might lose their way into the pitch-black areas in the caves , and hence the Guided tours. And these tours are very informative. There are various tours depending on our interest , energy and time. Some tours demand a good fitness levels while some doesn't. Beware that the caves are cooler than the outside , and carry a light jacket , just in case.","July 29, 2014",Go with a prep..,22,"Springfield, Illinois",3
Mammoth Cave,"Even if you're not a cave lover, don't miss Mammoth Cave! My husband & I took the Dome & Dripstones tour and the Historic tour and both were amazing. The two tours take you to very different places, so it's a good way to experience the cave. Both tours DO have lots of steps and lots of walking, but are so worth it. We made reservations on line for the Dome & Dripstones tour, but were able to get in on the Historic tour the next day of our visit. The guides for both tours were outstanding; very passionate about the cave and able to give good, understandable information. Also, if you are staying in the park, don't miss the evening ranger programs. We were there for 3 nights and took in all 3 programs-they were both informative and entertaining. Again, excellent presenters - if you're into National Parks, don't miss this one!","July 28, 2014",Awesome example of Mother Nature!,89,"Grand Ledge, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"I went to the Mammoth Caves when I was very young. Now that I'm older with kids of my own, I wanted to take them there, too. I went on their website and scheduled a Historic Cave Tour a few days before our trip. I'm glad I did, because it was sold out by the time we arrived. If I hadn't booked in advance, we would have been out of luck. I'd highly suggest the Historic Tour. It was amazing hearing the stories of when the tours first started, the early explorers, etc. as we walked through the same caves that they did such a long, long time ago. I'd love to try some of the other tours next time we go back. During the Historic Tour there were a few times where you had to walk bent over, even down stairs while bending sideways so you didn't hit your head. My wife and kids also loved the tour. As long as you can walk OK, I'd highly suggest this trip. The 2 hours flew by. The Fat Man's Misery will probably be the talk of your family's tour, too.","July 28, 2014",I'll be back!

Nine 16 and 17 year old girls and their fearless leaders were happy to be done by lunchtime. The oldest leader felt sore the next day, the girls were fine, but this was a challenge in many ways -- physically, emotionally, mentally -- for everyone.

Mammoth Cave,"This was my first time back to Mammoth Cave in about 45 years or so.I showed up a few minutes before the start of the Violet City Lantern Tour and was lucky enough to get in (one of the last two tickets - the tour is limited to 38 I think), and carried one of the lanterns (about 1 of 3 need to carry one - must be at least 16 to handle a lantern.) It was a great adventure, along well maintained paths and pretty safe. However, as warned by the staff, there are no bathroom facilities and it takes about three hours to get through. This can be a problem for older or younger visitors.. think about what happens when a 10 year old suddenly walks from the heat into the cold cave... result can get uncomfortable, so parents MUST tend to this issue before entering. Do not let the young'uns say they don't have to go!The great attraction of Mammoth Cave is pretty much what its name implies: the sheer size is overwhelming (this particular tour covers 3 of 400 known miles). However, rock formations are subtle - few stalactites or stalagmites on this tour, though some interesting water features when I went (mid July.) Don't expect to be amazed so much by the formations (Luray Caverns in Virginia is the best I've seen for that sort of stuff) but the history related to us by the guides was fascinating, if you like that sort of thing. The guides were knowledgeable and well trained to deal with ""situations"" (see warning above.)There are several other tours of varying difficulty that are less physically demanding; that should be considered before choosing a tour. I am an experienced hiker (though 56 yrs old) and I was a little winded going up some of the hills (and this without a pack) - I think the high humidity had something to do with it; the terrain does not seem difficult at all.","July 27, 2014","Violet City Lantern Tool, but not for everyone",3,"Dartmouth, Massachusetts",4

Mammoth Cave,"My friends and I did the domes & dripstones. It was an absolute blast! We all are very active and athletic so we found this moderate tour to be rather easy. There was some elderly with canes and young children who struggled. A woman with an unruly toddler thought the tour was only 30 minutes long when the tour guide, pamphlet, and signs made it clear it was two hours, so we weren't able to experience complete darkness in the cave like planned. Over all I had a blast and would be more than willing to go back and tackle a strenuous tour. Just make sure you read the pamphlet and know what you are getting yourself into. Wear tennis shoes or hiking boots and if you're a freeze baby bring a light jacket seeing the caves are about 50 degrees. If you are claustrophobic I wouldn't do any moderate or strenuous tours but you should be able to handle an easy one.","July 24, 2014",Know what you're getting yourself into,26,"Cleveland, Ohio",5

Mammoth Cave,"I have been to several caves, in different parts of the world, and I felt that this tour involved more walking and ducking under low hanging rocks than actual cave sight-seeing. We took the Domes and Dripstones tour and we did see some interesting formations, but not as many as I would have liked. I understand that the tours were designed in a way to protect and preserve the caves. The tour guides were very well informed, accommodating and entertaining, but I felt they didn't enforce their rules very well. They had announced that flash photography was prohibited, but the fellow in front of me was taking a lot of flash pictures, and neither of the guides censured him. This could be a factor in my lack of enjoyment. The surrounding park is beautiful, the visitor's center and the on-site museum are a wonder to explore. Maybe the Historical tour would have been a better experience for me, and I will make sure to do that one the next time I am in the area. Definitely not a tour for the weak-kneed, as a lot of stairs have to be climbed up AND down.","July 23, 2014",Cave tour,17,"Cebu City, Philippines",3

We spent 2 days doing the Cave tours: Historic Tour and then the Domes and Dripstones. If you want to do the Sky Chamber tour be sure to do a reservation well in advance as it fills quickly.

Mammoth Cave,"The tours, especially the easy ones fill up fast. Took the Historic tour which lasted about 2 hrs. The majority of the cave area is paved with metal railings. There are some areas that require some exceptional ducking. There were other areas that I feel are very narrow, like entering in sideways that might tend to give a heavier person some problems. Our guide was very knowledgeable but did not wait till the entire group caught up. The end of the tour had many many steps to climb like an elevator shaft. Just one note... I thought there would be stalgtites and pools of water. There are none.","July 22, 2014",Might want to book online,18,"Northfield, OH",3

Mammoth Cave,"Our family of 10, kids ages 3 to 10 plus parents and grandparents in their 60's, found the Dripstone Tour more to our liking. Both involve walking up 500 stairs, squeezing through narrow passageways, and bending over to fit under low ceilings. Both require tickets, bought in advance if you are coming on a busy day, and take 2 hours. In the Historic Tour I had to crawl on my knees [I'm 6'3, and 69 years old] to get through ""Tall Man's Squeeze."" Not for long, about 5 minutes, but it was uncomfortable. The Historic Tour gave us an interesting narrative, but no stalactites or stalagmites. That is what we preferred about the Dripstone Tour. It, too, was mostly passageways, but with beautiful formations toward the end of that tour.We also did two surface tours that were very interesting. These are free, not guided. The Cedar Sink was a about an hour of good-paced walking to a very large sinkhole, where an underground river emerges from the cliff, flows maybe 70 yards, then goes back underground. We did this at 5 pm on a Saturday, and were the only people on the trail. The walk is through a heavy forest, but a good trail of very fine pebbles plus stairs, many stairs. Our second surface hike took also about an hour, and starts from the Visitor Center, going downhill to where the River Styx emerges from underground to flow into the Green River. We recommend both -- take water with you. Keep an eye out in the park for wild turkeys!Oh, and the hotel connected to the visitor center has a nice little cafe.","July 22, 2014",Domes and Dripstones Tour is more interesting than the Historic Tour,29,"Dublin, Ohio",4

Definitly choose the Historic Tour it was amazing, everything was spot on. Cant wait to go back! Only suggestion would be is to check to tour times.","July 22, 2014","Amazing, will definitely come back",1,,5
Mammoth Cave,"My family opted to take the historic tour as so many reviews indicate it is a good choice. It was 2 hours long and had about 450 steps. It was a good choice as others have indicated. The cave itself was excellent. The tour was excellent, but would be remiss if I did not include that the tour guide did not wait for the group to come together as a group to begin the historical information related to the designated stop!! How frustrating this was!! My wife, daughter and I were in the middle of the group and did not fall behind at all and by the time we reached each milestone point, the discussions about the area were either over or almost over! By the time the guide at the rear of the group to make sure everyone was accounted for reached each stop, the group was ready to move again, so the people in the back of the group never even had a chance to rest, look around at the area or obtain any information about the area. I understand time tables and to keep on track, but during the tour, I did not even stop to take pictures, talk to anyone and kept moving and the tour took exactly 2 hours. Lost a lot of good historical information on this tour. Recommendation: Stay close to the leading guide up front if you want to learn everything about the designated stops and enjoy the caves, but better put on your running shoes!!","July 21, 2014",Historic Tour Tainted!!,24,"Oak Creek, Wisconsin",4
Mammoth Cave,"My boyfriend had never been on a cave tour, so I decided Mammoth Cave would be a nice introduction to caves for him. I chose the Historic Tour for us and we were not disappointed. Our park ranger was an excellent guide. He was very informative with just the right amount of sarcasm for entertaining our group. We wish we could remember who he was.... (2:15 Historic Tour on 07/20/2014, toured with Ranger Kevin, whoever you are man, we thank you!) The tour itself lasted the full 2 hours, and for us was very much like a cardio workout. A very fun and beautiful cardio workout. We're both heavier, but not completely out of shape. The tour is definitely moderate, but for some it could be pretty strenuous. There is plenty of ducking, and some squeezing (Fat Man's Misery and Tall Man's Agony). I had no problem getting through the tight passageways, however, be advised that if your waist and hips are over 65"" you're probably going to have a really tough time squeezing through some of the spots in there. There are some inclines, plenty of stairs (mostly going down), rough and uneven paths, and two see-through bridges. Thanks to the other reviews on here I just brought a very light sweater with me, and ended up having to take it off towards the end of the tour. I would have been fine walking the entire tour without it and wearing just my tank top. You move around enough to not really feel the chill in the cave. The only thing I didn't like about this experience was how quickly we had to move through the cave. I understand we had 2 miles to cover in 2 hours with a couple stops included to hear about the history of the cave, but it would have been nice if the tour could have been a little more leisurely, where you could stop in a few areas and just take a couple minutes to really take it all in. Overall this was a great tour, and my boyfriend very much enjoyed it. I think this is a wonderful introduction to Mammoth Cave for first timers. We're excited to go back and try the other tours!","July 21, 2014",Mammoth Cave - First Time Exploration,1,"Clarkrange, Tennessee",4
Mammoth Cave,"We were visiting with a five year old child, so we selected the Frozen Niagara tour due to the shorter length and low number of required steps. When we arrived at the visitor's center, we picked up our tickets (we had made reservations online). The center was clean and the staff we spoke with were helpful. There was a small museum in the visitor's center, but we didn't go through that. Our tour started with a bus ride to a man-made entrance. Our tour guide spent the bus ride covering a bit of the history of the cave system, and the section we were going to be touring, which was interesting. The cave tour itself was interesting. This section of the cave has more formations than most of the rest of the cave since this section still has water flowing through it. There are a few required steps, and some more optional ones. As long as you don't have an issue with the stairs, I would recommend going down the optional ones. The room at the bottom of the stairs was the most impressive part of the tour. Our guide had a lot of interesting information about the way the cave and the formations formed. Overall, we had a great time.","July 21, 2014",Frozen Niagara tour - good for kids,7,Cincinnati,5

I would take the history tour first because you might be disappointed by it if you see the dripstones first. As many others have mentioned, if you want to hear the ranger guide, just get near the front. Many people did not seem to care about hearing the guide so I guess it works out. If you have fear of heights like I do (see my Pensacola lighthouse review for free entertainment), the dripstones tour may be a bit unsettling but it is worth it.

Mammoth Cave,"We should have paid more attention to the NPS info that 'strongly advises' reservations. We got on some of the tours that we wanted, but learn from our mistake--reserve in advance. The more adventurous members of the group wanted to go on some adventurous tours, but we were told they get sold out months in advance. Members of the group did go on Historic, Domes and Drips, Discovery self-guided, and Frozen Niagara tours. Historic is two hours, pretty easy, large passages, lots of history talk. Seeing the smoke signatures on the ceilings was pretty cool. The Fat Man's Misery is narrow, but not all that tight. The ascent at the end is the toughest part--about 150 feet of stairs straight up, and you can look through the grating beneath your feet! The Discovery is briefer and cheaper and you get to see the huge entrance cavern, which is pretty impressive. The Domes is pretty adventurous, 2 hours, more like spelunking-lite. Long stairs down at the start, with some twisting and turning around rocks, and stairs over some seriously deep holes that freaked my daughter. Impressive, but I would not advise for larger or less flexible people. You get dripped on and there are bugs crawling on the ceiling over your head. I would have liked to see some bats, but it was the wrong season. The tour ends with the Frozen Niagara, which is pretty neat to see. Don't take your babies or small children on any of the tours but the Discovery, which is pretty flat and wide open. There were screaming babies on my tours and I felt sorry for their moms trying to negotiate some of the tight squeezes--I had a hard time getting my camera through some of the holes. Photos were hard to take--it's dark--and looking at them later...You have to go to really feel it.

Visit the national parks page for Mammoth before you head out so you are sure you know for which to plan. The tour sizes are a little larger than is practical so try to stay to the front of the tour line so you can hear. Wear comfy shoes and bring a light jacket - its humid but cool. Not great for the littlest of littlest (you don't want to try to carry a baby or toddler on ANY of these tours) but perfect for junior and senior :-) cave explorers.

Mammoth Cave,"What a fantastic place to visit. My wife and I had been many years ago but were excited to go back with our kids. We did the Domes and Dripstones trip in the morning and the Violet City Lantern Tour in the afternoon. Both were excellent but offered very different experiences. Domes was a lot of stairs and some tight spaces with some outstanding features at the end. Great for getting a quick feel for being in a cave particularly if you are with smaller kids or have limited time. The guide also provided some interesting information along the way. If you have a little more time and can handle a more intense, three hour adventure, do the lantern tour. There is only one of these offered each day, but if you can choose one, this is it. It really was an incredible experience being in that cave with only a few lanterns lighting the way! The tour was limited to about 40 people and young kids aren't allowed so it's a great opportunity to really soak in everything the cave has to offer. We saw some amazing sights along the way and learned a great deal from our guides. I really enjoyed this tour, as did my wife and teenaged kids. That said, it is a long trip with no food or bathrooms so plan accordingly. You will also get a workout, but it's completely worthwhile!","July 16, 2014",Awesome Experience,13,Michigan,4

Climbing down the pit stairs was pretty interesting, but if you are afraid of heights, I would not suggest the tour. At times the walk way would become quite narrow, in my opinion adding to the adventure. The cave featured quite large rooms. However, we only saw one room (The Frozen Niagara) with stalagmites which was a bit disappointing because we had expected more.

Mammoth Cave,"I hadn't been to Mammoth Cave before but knew that they were the largest caves in the world. The park provides a variety of tours from the beginner to the expert. I chose the Historical and Domes and Dripstones tours, because that gave me a general idea on what the caves had to offer. As caves go, these are not the most beautiful, but they are fascinating, with colorful stories of ancient inhabitants and Civil War connections. The tours were well-organized but numbered more than 100 people each. It could be difficult for some of them to keep up, but it was manageable. The tour guides were very knowledgeable about the cave, something I expected from the NPS. Unless, you are adventurous, I found that one day in the caves was enough. The hiking trails were fairly maintained and marked, but the scenery was not especially spectacular. All in all, I glad I went and recommend Mammoth Cave to those interested in underground wonders of the world.","July 16, 2014",Good Tours but Very Large Groups,42,"Acworth, Georgia",5

Uh no - I would have had to do the rest of the mile on my hands and knees. They know what they're doing and you will have an amazing time. It's a beautiful park with hiking paths for all levels. If you do a large tour group I recommend that you get as close to the front as possible. Not only will you have the benefit of the rangers knowledge, but you will get to the benches faster than the rest, so you'll have a nice rest stop while you wait for the rest to catch up.

After the tour we wanted to see the original, natural opening but it was difficult since they have it blocked off for ""self guided"" tours that are monitored by the Rangers.

The tour guide was so friendly and helpful! Be warned, however, this tour is not for the faint of heart. There is 700 stairs and lots of steep hills. It is a moderate trail for avid hikers and more intense for those who do not work out or hike frequently. This cave is the longest known cave in the world at 400 miles! We toured 4 and it was spectacular! We saw an underwater pool, dripstones, and so much more! If you are looking for milder tours there are plenty to choose from. Be warned buy your tickets early!! They sell out quick!","July 14, 2014",Amazing!,0,"Wadsworth, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"If this is your first time to Mammoth Cave, take the Historic tour. It is every bit of the 2 hours/2 miles as advertised. We have been in two other caves on this trip prior to visiting Mammoth and all of them different. if you are looking for a personal guided tour this is not for you. There are at least 100 people on the tour. The main chamber is wide open and then you do squeeze down to single file about halfway thru. The next time we visit we will check for a smaller grouped, longer, more detailed tour. Definitely worth the stop. BTW we took our 3yr old on the tour with no problems.","July 13, 2014",Take the Historic Tour,24,,5
Mammoth Cave,"The park is gorgeous. We went through the tree lined roads to the visitor center. It is beautifully designed. The architect should win an award. It is also vey Eco friendly with water conservation and solar energy efforts. Also all the vehicles there run an alternative fuel. Not one diesel fume to be found. The trails are magnificent with many places to explore and learn about. As soon as you get close to the magnificent entrance a refreshing cool blast of air greets you and draws you right in. We went on the Historic, Introduction to Caving, and Domes and Dripstones tours which delighted us every step we took. Our fantastic guides Ranger Chris and Ranger Mary taught us everything and more about what we might want to know about the cave and the caving process itself. It was a great trip and I hope to be returning soon! ","July 12, 2014",Great adventure!!!,9,"Woodridge, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"My family of 5 stayed in a cottage. They are old, but comfortable. The staff at all the restaurants were so very nice.We took the Historic Mammoth Tour in the afternoon (so amazing) and the Domes and Dripstones tour the next morning. Fitting in these two tours, plus the stay overnight, made a great impression.The park is beautiful and the guides very interesting. There is no flash photography or backpacks allowed.If you have just an afternoon, or a day or two, this is one spot to include in your family vacation! Don't forget to bring a jacket down with you, it gets cold.","July 12, 2014",Great Time at Mammoth,5,"Tampa, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"Stopped on our way back home for a few hours and had lots of fun. Decided on the Historic Tour which was two hours long and we all enjoyed the tour. Our guide was friendly, informative, and funny. I agree with many of the other reviewers, stay close to the front to hear the comments from the guide along the way or you will miss a lot and it will not be as fun. Be sure to bring a jacket along as it is pretty cool (about 55 degrees) in the caves. It is also important to note that all tour times are Central Time Zone, so keep that in mind if you are traveling through and may be coming from Eastern Time Zone. Also, skip the small ""quick"" serve restauarnt at the adjoining hotel, food is average at best with a small selection and slow service. Overall was a fun experience and worth a few hours break from driving down the Interstate.","July 12, 2014",Good Family Fun,107,"Atlanta, Georgia",4
Mammoth Cave,"We are so glad we stopped to see these caves! There are several tours to choose from, but we chose the Historical Tour. It was a fun tour - and a nice 54 degrees in the cave...so bring a light jacket if you like. We had a great tour guide, with some great stories, but do wish they had more stops/information during the tour. If we went back, we would try the tour that went by the Indian artifacts and cave paintings.","July 12, 2014",Historical Cave Tour,27,"Dallas, Texas",5
Mammoth Cave,"Let me start by saying that we are not first time cave goers. We have been to many caves around the United States. Mammoth Cave was one I had always wanted to visit but we were never in the area until this trip. It wasn't even close to my expectations. After going through the web site, reading and comparing the different tours available, we decided on the Domes And Dripstones Tour. It seemed to include quite a bit, including other tours, and lasted two hours. It turned out to be an incredible waste of time and money. Just about the entire tour all you do is walk quickly through passageways and go up and down stairs. A couple of times they stop, in what seems to be a way for them to regroup and wait on the whole tour to be together again. The tour group is huge (over 100) so by the time everyone is together you have missed nearly everything they have talked about at these stops. This also means that the entire time you are walking there is no information or sites to explain. Nothing but just walking. Nothing to see. There is only one small section at the very end where you see formations. This takes all of five minutes. We had one person in our party who had never been in a cave and even he was disappointed. I really don't understand why this cave tour is so popular. It was boring and there are so many better cave tours around the country.","July 11, 2014",Mammoth Cave wasn't worth the money.,90,"Ackley, Iowa",2
Mammoth Cave,"When we told our eleven year old daughter that we were going on a 2 mile / 2 hour hike in a cave, she was skeptical. She thought it was going to ""boring"". When we finished, she responded ""Was that it? That was so much fun. We should have gone on the 4 hour one."" Our ranger, Autumn, was a fantastic story teller. She was interesting, informative and funny. Our family really enjoyed the Historic Tour. It was a little chilly. My husband was fine, but my daughter and I should have had light jackets.","July 10, 2014",Great Family Fun,32,"Winston Salem, North Carolina",5
Mammoth Cave,"Had a few hours to kill heading up to louisville, so we decided to give mammoth caved a try. We opted for historic tour. Both of us had never been in cave before. We both enjoyed the experience, history, and cool temps. Our guide was great and the 2 hours flew by. We stayed close to front guide so we could hear everything. There was a large tour group and I'm not sure if many in the rear could hear some of the interesting facts he mentioned. ","July 10, 2014",Cool tour for hot afternoon,4,"Lafayette, Louisiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"We drove four hours to go to the Mammoth Caves National Park and decided to take the Historic Tour, which is a trek of two miles that takes two hours to walk. Now, if you haven't been to too many caves it may be helpful to inform you to bring a light jacket. If you think you will stay warm from ""hiking"" you're wrong. The tour is more like a leisurely stroll through the caves, which were at a temperature of 57 degrees Fahrenheit. You don't really need hiking gear either. I personally dressed in my workout attire and good shoes but it isn't really necessary. I'd recommend wearing comfortable shoes not because, once again, you're hiking (because in reality you kind of aren't) but because two miles can take a toll on your feet. The cave is considered a ""dry"" cave so you shouldn't be too concerned with traction. This cave has the ""Fat Man's Misery"" and ""Tall Man's Misery"", I believe there are reviews for those on here but I will just say they aren't that difficult if you're limber and not, well, too fat or too tall. ""Fat Man's Misery"" lasts for a little while but not that long and ""Tall Man's Misery"" doesn't last very long at all. There are quite a few steps you will have to go up and down. You have to go up more then down. When you first enter the Cave you go down some 60 steps. Towards the end of the Tour you go up a straight shaft of stairs, I didn't it find it that difficult (though the tour guide dramatized it a bit) but I'm sure that will vary for each person. Then the 60 or so back up to the surface. Oh, also, you will find out that Mammoth Caves bat's have some sort of a disease. They inform you it has no effect on humans but at the of the tour you will have to walk across some foaming black things to clean the bottom of your shoes as to not spread the disease to bats in your area. On that note, I didn't see a single bat the entire two hours I was in there. Now, the reason I gave the tour four stars and not five. The tour groups are rather large and depending on where you are at (in the front with tour guide or the back) determines whether or not you will learn any history or not. There are a few stops where the tour guide waits for everyone to collect to give little history lessons on the cave but for the majority of the walk if you aren't right up by him you won't hear anything. The tour guide wasn't the most personable of people. He definitely seemed to have a ""Let's get this done and over with and I've said these same stories fifty billion times."" Don't get me wrong, we got him to warm up a little with a few jokes but he isn't there to be your buddy, he's there to make sure you get through the cave and spit a few facts at you. Oh and he definitely makes sure your tour is over in two hours. The people at the back of the group can straggle, there should be another tour guide at the back of the group (I don't know if she talks or what because I was at the front). So the tour is really great if you just kind of want to slowly move along and look at the cave. You have to be selective when you take pictures. Flash is prohibited so you can only really get pictures of places in the cave they have dim lights on. All in all it was neat to see the caves and enjoyable. Oh and don't bring young children. You're stuck in a dark cave for two hours. You do the math.","July 9, 2014",The Historic Tour,8,"Fayette, Ohio",4
Mammoth Cave,"This place is absolutely amazing. We went on the Domes & Dripstones tour and the Star Chamber tour. The Domes & Dripstones tour weaves you in and out different spaces throughout the cave. It was incredible to see how different parts of the caves are formed. The Star Chamber tour uses old lanterns to light your way just like the settlers did. It was fun to only have a latern lighting your way, definitely a different experience. I recommend both tours. Make sure to buy your tour tickets early tours sell out, we got ours at least a week ahead. Also bring a light jacket because it can get cold in the caves. This is an amazing place.","July 9, 2014",Amazing,12,Waukesha,5

At the deepest point, we were about 300 feet under ground. It is really something to see if you have never been inside a gigantic cave before. The tour is not strenuous for people who are in shape. Some in our group had trouble keeping up, despite the ranger's warning at the beginning. It is cold in the caves though, and I would recommend bringing a sweatshirt or something warm.","July 8, 2014",Awesome!,82,"Berwick, Maine",5

Mammoth Cave,"This was my second visit and each time there is more to learn. First off, more of this cave continues to be discovered which means each tour includes more information. Secondly, choose wisely which one or two tours would best suit your traveling group. Some are very easy to walk, while others are very strenuous. Read the brochure or online to choose. I suggest that you reserve your tickets online at least the day before because the popular tours sell out (the lantern tours). We went on the Historic tour in the morning and the Domes and dripstones in the afternoon. I would recommend either of them. I've been on one of the lantern tours before and it was excellent as well.","July 4, 2014",Americans should visit every National Park to appreciate our country.,24,"Niceville, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave is Mammoth. However, you only see Mammoth Cave, there is nothing else to see at the park except the cave. There are deer and turkey to see if you drive the roads slowly, but the cave is the one and only BIG attraction. The cave is huge, but not as decorated as other caves, such as Jewel Cave in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Tours vary considerably; in length, what you do (walk, crawl), and and time of day. Be honest with yourself about what you are capable of doing, there's no turning back once you get started. Then, make a RESERVATION for a tour time (see the park website). There is a visitor center museum to keep you occupied for maybe an hour but after that without a reservation you'll be just sitting and waiting for your time to go. Our tour guide was ok, be at the front of the tour if you want to hear everything.No flash photography, so know how to shut off your flash. Dress for the cooler cave temps. Cave city has some close cheap motels.","July 3, 2014",Make a reservation,6,"Ankeny, Iowa",4
Mammoth Cave,"We did the Domes and Dripstones cave tour and it was awesome. Ranger Eric was very informative and quite funny as well. The tour start to finish is 2 hours, that includes a brief safety talk and bus rides too and from the cave, so you aren't in the cave for two hours. It was very cool in the cave, but with all the steps and there is a bunch of them, we didn't need jackets. Even though the steps are mostly going down, it was a bit of a workout. The first 280 steps are practically straight down. They are narrow and wet and you have to watch out for cave rocks that are sticking out. It was all part of the experience, we loved it.You can see a lot of wildlife in the park too, we saw turkeys and a deer with a fawn during our short visit.","July 3, 2014",Domes and Dripstones is awesome!,11,Dows,5
Mammoth Cave,"This review is mostly just for the Domes and Dripstone Cave Tour. TIPS: Bring a jacket since it's a chilly 54 degrees Fahrenheit year round. Wear shoes with good traction since it can get slippery on parts of the 0.75 mile tour.After buying tickets, we met our guides outside, and our group (about 50 people) took a 10 minute bus ride, then started the moderately strenuous tour with 300 steps down in the beginning where George Morrison blasted an entrance with dynamite in 1925. There are another 100 steps, and a still another 100 optional steps, throughout the rest of the 2 hour tour. This tour costs $12 for adult, $8 for kids. Tour times: 9:30, 10, 11:15, 12:15, 12:45, 1:30, 2:00, 2:45, 3:45 Mammoth Cave earns its name because it is the largest cave system in the world, with over 400 miles of cave having been mapped so far, and new paths being explored every year. A large part of the tour is the interaction with the guides. Steve and Jerry did a fine job of telling the story of the cave as a tourist site, and of answering questions (especially from the kids on the tour) about the cave, the bats, and so forth. The guides were very friendly and knowledgeable. For us, I guess everything depends on what else one has experienced. Having visited the Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico, the Domes and Dripstone Cave Tour pales in comparison. If you have not visited any other caves, this will be an awesome experience for you though. Most the the tour is just limestone everywhere, layers and layers of dry rock. Toward the end, there are more formations of stalactites and stalagmites, and columns. After the 10 minute bus ride returning to the parking lot and getting our shoes washed (to prevent the spread of white nose disease in bats), we walked over to the historic entrance (as opposed to the dynamite-created entrance) and peeked in. The airflow felt refreshing, and the entrance appeared deep and gaping.Since this review is just for the Domes and Dripstone Tour, maybe one of the other tours would have impressed me more. In short, this is a great tour for first-time cave visitors, but not so great if you've seen other active dripstone caves.","July 3, 2014",Domes and Dripstone Cave Tour,187,"Buena Park, California",3

Mammoth Cave,"I have been to Mammoth Cave several times over the years. The most recent visit I took my daughters (teens) to see the cave. We went on the historic tour and it was a good tour for our purposes. I wouldn't recommend it for people with younger children. Some were on our tour but got bored and either became fussy or made a lot of noise once they realized their sounds would bounce around in the cave. Read the tour descriptions before you go and know what you're getting into before you book your tour. Keep in mind- there is nothing like taking a tour that enters through the natural entrance. You get to see the large opening in the ground and feel that cool breeze on a hot summer day. It always makes a lasting impression. Also, the cave temperature is 54 degrees year round so take a jacket or sweater so that you won't be cold on your tour. Wear sturdy footwear- this is not the best place for sandals. Photography is allowed although flash must be turned off. Finally, it is Central time zone so keep that in mind if you're coming from somewhere in the eastern section of the country so you don't arrive way too early and have to wait a long time for your tour. No backpacks are allowed in the cave- purses and camera cases are OK. There are no restrooms in the cave.","July 1, 2014",Who can resist the longest known cave in the world?,51,"Redlands, CA",4
Mammoth Cave,Took a day trip to Mammoth Cave and did the Historic tour. I had never been there before and was a little scared of feeling claustrophobic. I didn't have any issues and actually liked the parts that we had to squeeze through or duck under rocks. I learned a ton from our guide and the two hours felt like 30 minutes. Our group was sold out and was quite large. That was the only down side...I wish it was a smaller groups.

Mammoth Cave,"I can only speak for the historic tour. I did not take any of the others and maybe this would have been a different review if I did, but this was a pretty boring activity truth be told. It's a cave. Two hours of being in a cave. No cool pools of lighted water to look at, no stalagmites, no interesting cave paintings. It's a cave. We walked two miles through this thing and yup, CAVE.There was nothing remarkable about what we saw or learned. The only thing that I found remotely interesting was the graffiti on the ceiling which dated back to 1855 or older and the stories of the people who died in there. The guide was great, very engaging and answered questions with ease but afterwards I Googled the cave and was able to read pretty much everything I learned on Wikipedia. I wish I would have done the Google search first and then chosen another tour that might have been more interesting. They kind of push you into this tour if you've never been there before and you've never been there before so you don't know any better. I understand there are boat tours of some sort and tours that take you to stalagmites as well. Do those. Because if you've ever been in a cave before, trust me, you've already been in this one. Also, it should be noted that if you can't deal with stairs, crouching and ducking down, enclosed spaces and pitch black, this isn't the tour for you. They do mention this when you're about to go into the tour but by then you're kind of committed. And it's cold in there so dress accordingly. Closed toed shoes, sweater and long pants, even in the dead of summer. It's 54 degrees and there's no sun. Stick close to the guide so you can hear better and ask questions while you're walking. No backpacks allowed so we brought a waist strapped bottle of water that I use for running.","June 30, 2014","It's just a cave, seriously. ",108,"Champlin, Minnesota",3
Mammoth Cave,"We went on the two hour tour and everything you see and hear will amaze and educate you. I would reccommend this park to anyone even though it is off of the beaten path. They have an education center and several options for tours including the history tour and tours that only focus on the geology of the cave,. It only cost us $32 for two adults and a 12 year old. I think it was worth every penny. I would suggest that you do not wear sandles or flip flops. Although there is an effort made to be accessible to those with Handicaps there is really no way to make the cave friendly for the handicaped.","June 30, 2014",One of those things you must do in your lifetime,51,"Portland, Tennessee",5
Mammoth Cave,"Two things to start off with---They will NOT allow any backpacks or backpack-type purses on tour. Mammoth Cave is one CENTRAL TIME!Our Granddaughters are 12, 10, 9 & 6 and we did the Dripstones Tour, which lasted about 2 hours. There were a lot of steps but very doable, even for the youngest granddaughter. It's advisable to wear tennis shoes---not flip flops---cause if you happen to loose one over the edge, you won't be getting it back! Also take a jacket and good idea for young girls to wear capris not shorts as it's pretty cool in the cave. They do not allow any flash pictures in the cave so it's hard to get really good pictures while you are walking through but toward the end where most of the Dripstones are located, you will get plenty and it's very beautiful and amazing to see. There are also two stops during the tour where there are benches to sit on and the Ranger tells more of the history of the Cave. On the trails, the walls are close-yes, but not scary tight. There are railings any place that is steep or where there's moisture on the trail. If you are 5'6 or over, you will need to watch your head! Our Ranger was a nice lady but she REALLY made to tour sound almost impossible to squeeze through the walkways on this tour and just about scared our girls into thinking they couldn't make it from what she said about ""very tight places"" where she had to even take off her hat to make it through....no one had any issues or problems. There were about 100 people with us so get to the front of the group if you can. I would hope they could tone down the ""scary, trail information"" before entering (they give it twice--once before you get on the bus to Cave and then again before you enter the Cave...so young kids don't get scared and back out at the last from this great tour. I know they must warn everyone that it's not a ""walk-in-the-park"" to get down into the Cave; and people with health issues must also know about all the steps but I asked our girls (note their ages) if they were scared at any time and their reaction was ""never in the Cave...just before we entered the Cave, after the Ranger talked to everyone!""","June 30, 2014",Trip with four Granddaughters,37,"New Palestine, Indiana",5

Two days just was not enough to do everything we wanted to do around the grounds and kayak a lot more. A very beautiful place to visit. Wondering the trails at night was so much fun seeing the bats fly around and all the fireflies. Lots of areas for pictures with a really excellent natural background.

Its doable but rough. The tour itself was OK but nothing super impressive. My uncle and cousin enjoyed it though. They had very friendly rangers posted through various areas of the tour that would answer questions if you had any. We then left and came back later for the Frozen Niagara tour.

Mammoth Cave,"We loved Mammoth Cave!!!! We booked three different tours over 2 days in advance of our trip. We did the Historic Tour, the Star Chamber tour and the Domes & Dripstones tours.When we arrived we had to pick up our tickets. The line moved very quickly.Be advised that all of the tours had many steps and quite a bit of walking. Also, there were areas that were dark, steep and high. You cannot bring anything that you must carry on your back on the tours. Purses, camera bags and anything that you carry on the front is acceptable. You can bring water but nothing else in the way of food or drink. Also, flash photography is not permitted in the caves. After your eyes adjust to the low light, the flashes are blinding. The Rangers were very informative and interesting. If you are looking for stalactites and stalagmites take the Domes & Dripstones tour. The other caves are very dry and don't have these features.We also did a number of drives around the park. We saw quite a bit of wildlife, turkeys and deer. We also got to see the river and one of the small ferry's. That was very interesting.We enjoyed the picnic area. We were going to eat in the dining room at the lodge one day for lunch, but it was closed due to lack of air conditioning. There were snack bars still open.I highly recommend Mammoth Cave. This is the longest cave system in the world, 400 miles and still counting. There is also quite a bit of history associated with the cave.","June 28, 2014",Wonderful!!,201,"Bethlehem, Pennsylvania",5
Mammoth Cave,"Beautiful park and ride from Louisville. Tour was informative, but be aware the caves are VERY cold inside compared to the outside air, so come prepared! Easy hike as far as the historical tour. Could have been a bit shorter (2 hours). The outdoor area is absolutely beautiful and other things to do are available as well.","June 28, 2014",Cave tours,19,"San Jose, California, Usa",4
Mammoth Cave,"We went on the historic tour, and later the domes & dripstones. In both cases we had excellent NPS Ranger tour guides who were informative and humorous. Pace is slow enough to appreciate the views. Tour descriptions are accurate on NPS site for the cave. D&D tour has more visuals, but historic tour is more informative. We have also done lantern tours in the past - these are good for getting a feel for the cave as early visitors might have seen it. These are especially fun for the kids.Our only negative experience was lunch, the A/C had been out all week in the restaurant and it was just too hot and muggy to sit and eat. We went next door to the fast food restaurant where the A/C worked, but they only have very basic fare and it is not very good even for that. Don't know why they would tolerate no A/C in the hotel and restaurant for a week, but it sounds like government in action! Just grateful we weren't staying there!","June 28, 2014",Park service tours are excellent,109,"Herndon, Virginia",5
Mammoth Cave,"We did the 'Wild Cave Tour' and had a blast! The reservation website states that the tour is extremely strenuous.....it is. Do not take this warning lightly. You will be given coveralls, a helmet with lamp, gloves, knee pads, and a fanny pack (my apologies to any Brits!). You will need good hiking boots with excellent tread. They will stop the tour halfway for a bathroom and lunch break. I suggest you bring a water bottle and more than a few granola bars. The tour is difficult. If you are overweight or out of shape you probably don't want to do this. Likewise if you are claustrophobic or afraid of heights. During the 5 or so hours you'll be crawling on your hands and knees, pushing/pulling yourself through narrow (often times very narrow) passageways, and doing more than a bit climbing over rocks. The guides are awesome and make the tour safe and enjoyable. You'll be exhausted and sore but the tour is well worth it!!! Much better than the other tours if you are up to it.","June 28, 2014",Awesome Wild Cave Tour!,22,"San Diego, California",5
Mammoth Cave,"Our family participated in 3 cave tours & the Sand Cave Almanac Caravan. The fascinating part about this cave system is the history about the caves, and the length & significant size of the system. My 67 year old Mom, my husband & son & myself did the Historic Tour. This tour is described as being moderate. It is 2 miles & two hours and had 440 steps, most of which were ascending at the end of the tour. My Mom did pretty good keeping up until we got to the end. If the tour would have went at a slower pace she could have handled the steps at the end easier, but they hammered home the point that the tour (last one of the day), needed to be completed by 6:00. They stopped twice to go over historic information which as interesting.The next day Mom & I went on the Frozen Niagra Tour which was much more our speed with only 12 steps. This was more of a traditional cave with stalactites, stalagmites, etc. Husband & son went on the Domes & Dripstones tour at 8:15. There were only 20 people on the tour which gave the tour guide the opportunity to do a more in depth, personalized tour. They enjoyed this more than the historic tour.But our favorite experience here was not a cave tour and it was free. At 1:00 we met a park ranger (Jackie Wheet) for the Sand Cave Almanac caravan and walk. He told us the fascinating and heartbreaking story of Cave explorer Floyd Collins. He took us to three different sights as he shared the details of the tragedy. We were all captivated by the story & the way Mr. Wheet shared the tale of Floyd Collins. I HIGHLY recommend participation in this tour. It was our favorite part of Mammoth Cave.Overall, we had a great experience at Mammoth Cave & hope we have the opportunity to visit again.","June 28, 2014",Enjoyable Visit to Mammoth Cave,41,North Carolina,5
Mammoth Cave,"Pros: 1. Unbelievable natural formation 2. Cool temps in cave, great summer trip. 3. Lots of history. 4. Knowledgable guides. 5. Generally not too narrow or dark, easy to navigate. 6. Good value for the money. 7. Tour time was just right-- neither too long nor short. Cons: 1. A few tight spaces could upset those with claustrophobia. 2. If you get stuck with unruly children in your group, consider waiting for the next group as they can really be a distraction. 3. Damp in some places, so wear good walking shoes to keep from slipping (NO flip flops!). 4. No restrooms or water once you enter the caves--plan ahead.","June 28, 2014",Must See to Believe,21,"Atlanta, Georgia, United States",5
Mammoth Cave,"Our family visited Mammoth Cave in May of 2014; we took the historic tour. Our guide, a fourth generation Mammoth Caves tour leader, was well-versed and very interesting. It is conceptually very exciting to be spending time in the largest cave system on Earth (by far!). But the cave itself does not offer much visually. With the exception of one or two spots on the two hour tour, you are looking at brown walls, brown floor and brown ceiling. There is one part of the cave that has some stalactites and stalagmites, but that is modest and not included in the historic tour. That said, the park above the cave is very lovely, and our family enjoyed a good hike through the forest and along the river.","June 26, 2014","Excellent guides, but less than stunning",8,"Saint Louis, Missouri",4
Mammoth Cave,"We visited Mammoth Cave this past weekend with small kids. You cannot take a stroller or a backpack into the cave during the tour so make sure to take everyone to the bathroom beforehand (maybe twice!). We did the Frozen Niagara tour - it was of course beautiful, but the walk was very short and you didnt get to see much of the cave. I wish we would have done a longer tour. The Frozen Niagara Tour would be perfect if you want a short tour (only a little over an hour) and very little distance to walk (although there was an optional part with a lot of stairs but you can pass on those). The walk was easy. If you have a baby that may be the right tour for you. We had little kids and wish we would have gotten to see more of the cave. Overall, Mammoth Cave National Park is a beautiful area, amazing cave system and can't wait to go back next summer for a visit!","June 26, 2014",Amazing Wonder - Went with small kids,14,kentucky,4
Mammoth Cave,"This is our third visit to the Mammoth Cave area and it's always a good time. This time we took the Domes and Dripstones tour and the Star Chamber tour. Both tours had excellent guides and they really knew what they were talking about with the history of the cave. Lots of background information and stories. We would highly recommend the Star Chamber tour, which takes place at night and uses lanterns for the tour. Take at least two tours to get a good experience. Don't rush your visit.","June 25, 2014",Awesome tours,42,"Carol Stream, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"We took 2 tours of the caves-the Historic tour and the Domes and Dripstone tour. Both tours were around 2 hours each. Lots of walking, stairs, stooping to avoid low ceilings, etc.Make sure you read about the tour and pay attention to the restrictions. It's cool in the cave (54 F). I wore shorts and a polo shirt, and I was fine. Others might want to wear a sweater.","June 25, 2014",Good workout!,24,"Woodstock, GA",5
Mammoth Cave,"We visited in late May and stayed on the property for one night. We, being myself, husband, and two daughters, 11 and 12 decided upon the Dripstones Tour. Our guide was very nice and as they say it was different than most caves as it's known more for size. We found it interesting, but having been to Carlsbad Caverns, Caves in Texas, and ones in ALabama; it was just okay to us. I think if you are into geology, this would be much more interesting to you just to see the different layers in the caves. If you have children, pick up a Junior Ranger book this was the highlight for them to earn badges.","June 24, 2014","Good, but not Great.",111,Mississippi,3
Mammoth Cave,"We took the domes and drips tour. The guide gave lots of history on the caves but the caves themselves were nothing special. We had been to Luray Caverns during this trip and that blew this away. Maybe if we chose a different tour, we would have been more impressed. To me, I could have been looking at chipped out concrete for most of it","June 24, 2014",just ok,120,"Monroe, New York",3
Mammoth Cave,"We visited in early June and did not book advanced tickets, as we had a seven year old with us and didn't want to over do it. We did the historical and domes and dripstones tours, which were both about two hours each. The Historical Tour covers about two miles of the cave, and you're in an enormous group. And when I say enormous, I'm not kidding, and the group is all shapes and sizes, ages and abilities. We spent the bulk of our time either trying to navigate around slower people to keep up ourselves, or running to keep up with the speed demons in the group. The real challenge for keeping together came when we reached a section of the cave called ""Fat Man's Misery."" This part of the cave had you walking through a channel waist/chest deep in places and very narrow. There were people on our tour who could not really fit into the channel because of weight issues. This slowed a section of our tour down significantly, and since they run the tours so close together, we were rather rushed through the second half. We passed things I would have liked to know more about, but couldn't ask because of the size of the group. I only recommend this tour if you've done your research into the cave history yourself and can interpret on your own.The Domes and Dripstones tour was better. The group was smaller, and the tour starts with a LARGE number of stairs in a very narrow stairwell. The tour is a bit more physically demanding than the Historical tour, but was still totally doable by our seven year old companion, and there were younger children on the tour as well. Our guide told a lot of the same jokes as our first guide, but felt less rehearsed, and I enjoyed learning about the geology of the cave. If you only have time for one tour, skip the Historical and do the Domes and Dripstones. Finally, I'm not sure what was going on the weekend we were there, but due to it's remoteness, we had counted on being able to eat in the park for lunch, only to discover that ALL the restaurants were closed! This had not been posted on the website prior to our visit, and was obviously unplanned. The hotel lost A/C so that took out two restaurants, and the third was inexplicably closed due to a private party! In what world should a National Park be scheduling private parties on a Saturday in the summer?!? The only option left to us was a food cart serving hot dogs and canned soda. We left the park to find food elsewhere, and the closest was Cave City, about fifteen minutes away.","June 24, 2014",Beautiful,56,"Lexington, Kentucky",4
Mammoth Cave,This destination is a must see when in Kentucky. The tours are scheduled through out the day and easy to schedule. The amazing size and depth of the caves is spectacular.

Mammoth Cave,"Before my trip, I saw the question, ""What is the one tour that I should take of Mammoth Cave?""Well, now that I have toured the cave, my answer is, ""Take two.""The ""Historic Tour"" and the ""Domes and Dripstones Tour"" are meant to compliment each other. (There are other tours that cover some of the same ground as these two tours, but there is no overlap between the Historic Tour and the Domes and Dripstones Tour.) The Historic Tour will take you in the historic entrance and you will experience the reason why it was named Mammoth. There are huge rooms--amazingly huge. And you will see saltpeter mines and learn about the history of the cave going back to prehistory.The Domes and Dripstones tour is more beautiful. You take a bus to the New Entrance and then take stairs down a dome--a large natural shaft and it's very interesting to see all of the changes in the rock as you walk down. Towards the end of the tour you see dripstones--the stalactites, stalagmites, and flowstone that most people think of when they think ""cave"" but that are absent in most of Mammoth. You exit at a lower level, so you don't have to climb back up all of those stairs.Both of the above tours can have a lot of people on them but they are also given many times a day. The rangers do such a great job with the tours. You might also want to check out the free programs they do at the amphitheater in the evening.My son and I were also lucky enough to get the last two spots for the ""Introduction to Caving"" tour. But you need to be in good physical shape, not be more than 42 inches around, and have hiking boots that cover your ankle and have good tread. I was glad that they did not get the tape measure out to check, but they did carefully check our footwear and a group of three did not go on the tour because one did not have proper ankle coverage. This tour is with headlamps and in almost natural portions of the cave--meaning no concrete floor. You will not only crawl on your hands and knees for good stretches, but you will also have to commando crawl for a while. I loved it but I was exhausted after the tour. This tour generally sells out. We had a great time at Mammoth and I encourage you to take more than one tour. Take the last Historic Tour given in the afternoon and then a morning Domes and Dripstones. If you are only going to take one tour, ask yourself what you most want: history or beauty?","June 23, 2014",What tour you should take,62,"Atlanta, Georgia",5
Mammoth Cave,"We went on the Domes and Dripstones tour. The dripstones at the end were neat to look at but it is pretty boring besides that. The tour guide gave some interesting bits of information but didn't really make the tour fun. She only talked a few times. She mainly talked at the beginning about how you shouldn't go if you can't go up/down 500 steps. No one in the group had any problems with that. There was a baby in the group that was crying. She seemed annoyed by that and finally asked them to go out with the other guide and leave the tour. Personally, the baby didn't bother me at all. I think a tour guide can make or break a tour and it broke ours. I did hear form a friend that the Historic Tour was much better but we didn't try that one out. I have definitely been on better cave tours.","June 22, 2014",Okay,14,"Machesney Park, Illinois",3

Mammoth Cave,"If you've never been to a cave, I highly recommend taking Mammoth Cave's Violet City Lantern Tour first. It's a small group (about 40 people) with 10 kerosene-lit lanterns for light. It really gives you a feeling for what the original discoverers felt when doing their exploring. My 15-year-old nephew and 16-year-old niece loved it! And the ranger who led the tour was extremely knowledgeable, great with answering questions. It was a three-hour tour. The Domes and Dripstones Tour at Mammoth Cave is a good followup -- a bigger tour group, but the lights are on for that one so you can see the scale and all the details, and it has very little overlap with the Violet City Lantern Tour. Be sure to make reservations for Violet City as it typically sells out weeks ahead of time. Notes: No backpacks or flash cameras on the Violet City Tour, I put my wallet and keys in a binoculars case, and that was allowed. No food or beverages for sale, and no bathrooms. A good number of stairs, but it wasn't overly difficult. Do wear shoes with good, gripping soles -- flip flops and jellies would be way too slippery. Even though it's 52 degrees in there, a very light jacket is plenty. In fact, lots of people took off their jackets after they were in the cave for 15 minutes or so. The humidity makes it seem warmer than 52.","June 20, 2014",Take the Violet City Lantern Tour FIRST,41,Michigan,5

Mammoth Cave,"We took the historic tour and loved hearing a few interesting things about the caves and seeing some of the formations inside. However, our group was large and everyone was incredibly pushy. At points it felt like a cattle drive and the whole tour quickly lost any appeal. There was no way you could actually stop and admire anything without being elbowed to the back of the crowd, so asking the rangers anything along the way was entirely out of the question. I just wish the groups had been smaller, or at least more organized. Way too many families just let their kids wander ahead or behind and expected everyone to move out of the way as they tried to catch up with their kids (I understand that kids are kids, but after the fourth or fifth time it was more than obnoxious, just put down the camera for a moment and pay attention please). I also think they needed a better warning about the physical limitations to walking the cave or some sort of waiver as a lot of people had issues keeping steady footing through the more enclosed passages. One woman brought a baby, obviously uninformed of how tough the trip could get.If we had the opportunity for a smaller group tour (20 or 30 people instead of the sold out crowd), we would have happily taken it or paid more. Otherwise, this was a pretty tour but wasn't worth the money for the experience. ","June 18, 2014",The historic tour could have been better...,8,"New Hudson, Michigan",2

Mammoth Cave,Mammoth Cave was on the list to visit. It is huge. There were no easy tours available and none that did not involve a guide. The tour I took started with and 240 step descent that was very difficult. The steps were very narrow and you had to twist and turn just to get through. The group was large and we spent a lot of time waiting for everyone to assemble. The cave is mostly rock and not the traditional formations you see in most cave. But it is mammoth. Ranger guide was excellent and gave a pretty good tour but skimpy on the history of the park. All of the tours are described and difficult especially for the elderly and anyone with mobility issues. I was amazed at the parents who managed with small children. Carlsbad Caverns is more impressive and easier to see.,"June 17, 2014",Not the best cave experience,128,"Saint Louis, Missouri",3
Mammoth Cave,"I visited the cave along with 9 other friends. Michael and Michael were our tour guides for the 10am Historic tour. Both were knowledgeable and were fantastic tour guides. Its an easy tour that takes approximately 2 hours and takes you through the main entrance into the part of cave with some historic significance like the war of 1812. The group was big and had almost 40 people. It is a good option for children, but people like me (in mid 20-s) will feel bored after 10 minutes as it becomes monotonous and has little adventure factor. We then went on the 1.30pm domes and dripstone tour, again guided by the Michaels. This tour takes you through the new entrance which is 3 miles from the main entrance. The narrow (yes very very narrow) passage ways and the 100ft pits on either sides are sights you will never forget (the layout of the cave changes at every turn, so it doesnt become monotonous and it feels adventurous to walk through the narrow paths, especially the fat man's misery) . The tour finishes at the frozen Niagra, which is a MUST VISIT if you visit Mammoth caves. There are some wonderful hiking trails as well. Carry some winter wear because it tends to get cold once you enter the cave. Overall, it was a good experience.

The fact that the cave is dry makes it different and unique from many other caves I have visited. As for size, in my experience only Carlsbad has larger rooms. If you take this tour be aware that it requires you to crouch low in several places to pass under formations and to make a substantial climb up MANY flight of stairs at the end followed by about a quarter mile hike up a paved path with a moderate incline to return to the visitor center.

I had my seven-year-old and my four-year-old, who has autism, with me. While this park appears beautiful and the cave might be amazing, I wouldn't take children there unless they can be perfectly still and quiet. This tour was much more ""talking"" by the tour guide than walking, and the guide understandably wants to be heard by all participants without being interrupted by children. While I don't like to make an issue of my son's disability, we felt very unwelcome at the park all day due to his behavior, which was no different than any young child might display on any given day.If the park doesn't want any interruptions or childish behavior, I think they should indicate on their website that tours are only for children eight and up. I can appreciate that they want all guests to fully enjoy their tours, but we certainly will not be back.

Mammoth Cave,"I'm comparing this to my experiences at other caves - both large and small. I've visited caves in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Missouri, New Mexico and other spots. I would rank Mammoth Cave as just average as far as presentation to travelers.We didn't have time to go on a longer tour - and my son has was wearing a boot, so we had physical limitations. We decided to try the self guided discovery tour, and it was very disappointing. This tour has no special cave formations or anything very amazing at all. The historic entrance is very nice, but you spend 20 minutes of walking and don't see any special formations like stalactites. The basic self guided tours at Carlsbad or Luray Caverns allow you to walk easily near many special formations.I wanted to see some of Mammoth Cave, even with our limitations of time and physical ability to walk very far... but was very disappointed. I am looking forward to taking my son to Carlsbad Caverns - I think it's much nicer.","May 28, 2014","It was fun to see, but it could be better",30,"Dripping Springs, Texas",3
Mammoth Cave,"We had Ranger Allison as our guide, and she was very knowledgeable and pleasant to listen to. She was also very enthusiastic. We went on the Domes and Dripstones, and the Historic tours, both of which were excellent. The tour moves slowly, so I don't think you need to be in top physical condition to enjoy these tours, even though they warn you at the outset. Amazing things to see in the caves -- wish we could have had more than a day to spend here. The park above ground was also very beautiful and warranted more time to explore than we had to spend.","May 28, 2014",Amazing cave system and beautiful park,25,Canada,5
Mammoth Cave,"We visited the park with a family of 5 - two adults and three active boys (12, 10 and 10). The tours were really great for the whole family. I will describe the trips we took below, but whatever you decide to do I would recommend advance tickets. We saw multiple people who were unable to get tickets to the tour they wanted. Most of them were sold out the day we attended.We did the historic tour and the domes and dripstones tour. They were very different and both were interesting. The historic tour tended to be in much bigger parts of the cave that were a little less ""stunning"", but seemed a great way to get a sense of the overall cave. We did not find it physically challenging. In fact, I saw a couple of people carrying small children on that tour (which did seem to make it a little challenging). The domes and dripstones definitely had more wow factor, particularly at the end. I would say it was more challenging physically. We had a couple of older people on the tour who struggled at a few points. They seemed to be in reasonable shape, but did get winded with all of the up and downs on that one.We almost only did one tour and I am really glad we decided to do two. They each gave a different and interesting perspective. We are hoping to go back and do a few more - particularly one of the lantern tours which several people told us were really cool.They make a big deal on both about people being claustrophobic or afraid of heights. My wife has a touch of both and was fine, but we did have one person on the domes tour get very concerned. IMO it is not as big of deal as they make of it, particularly for the historic tour. I would just chat with them if you have a concern, they are pretty helpful.","May 28, 2014",Definetly a trip worth taking,11,"Ann Arbor, MI",5
Mammoth Cave,"We went without kids (ages 9, 10, and 12) in April. We went on the domes and dripstones tour. I only wish we had time to go on another tour.

Highly recommended.","May 27, 2014",Great place to visit,25,"Roanoke, Virginia",5

Mammoth Cave,"We did the Domes and Dripstones tour at 10am, which took about 2 hours. The guide tried to warn us of its strenuous pace and numerous stairs, but if you can do a moderate hike, you would be fine. The stairs are slippery though, which made me a little nervous and there are spots that you need to bend down, so make sure you are comfortable with that. The cave was expansive and had a lot of interesting things to look at but it isn't active, which makes it less interesting than some other caves in the area, like Cub Run. The worst part was that we were very rushed throughout and had a group of about 50 people including the tour guides, so this meant we had to go single file through a lot of places. I didn't think that we had ample time to stop and look at everything and there was only one ""room"" of drapery, unlike some other caves. I think it was worth the stop just to see it but wasn't on my list of most interesting caves that I've ever been to. Definitely need close-toed shoes and if you bring a camera, make sure you have a no-flash setting and a strap/bag.","May 27, 2014",Domes and Dripstones,12,"Memphis, Tennessee",3

I'd love to come back and do some of the longer hikes.","May 26, 2014",Go!,14,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"We went to Mammoth cave with a two year and a four year old on Memorial Day weekend. The only easy/moderate tour available at the time we booked was the Historic Tour. (Note, kids under 5 do not need tickets.) At first we were nervous about taking the little guys on a tour designated as moderate, but the very friendly ranger staff thought that they would do fine. It seems like the main reason that they classify this tour as ""moderate"" is that there are several places that require ducking down to walk for a quite a ways and several very tight locations. Unlike some of the adults on our tour, neither one of the kids had trouble navigating the passages. The ranger guide stopped five times for this tour; the longest discussion was 10 minutes (most were 5 minutes). During the walking times between the stops, it is fine for the kids to talk. So, if you are nervous about taking kids, I would say if they can follow directions, walk a mile on their own without being carried (or if you can carry them a mile without any problem) and they can sit quietly and listen to somebody talk for 10 minutes, you should be fine.The tour itself was interesting; although I think some of the other tours (which were sold out when we were there) probably have more interesting formations. The only real negative for us was the food situations. I had the impression that there was someplace to easily get some lunch after the tour. But the only food options were so crowded at lunch time, that actually getting food was pretty much impossible. It is possible they were just overrun because the holiday.","May 25, 2014",Historic Tour with Little Kids,48,chicago,4

Mammoth Cave,"This review will consist of three parts - the Historic Tour, the River Styx Spring Trail, and the Star Chamber Lantern Tour. My wife and I traveled south from MI with another couple to explore Mammoth Cave over the weekend, a new experience for three of us. After attempting to decipher which tours would best suit our interests via the tour descriptions listed on the Mammoth Cave National Park website, we settled on the Historic Tour as our starting point, coupled with a Star Chamber Lantern Tour later in the day. We purchased our tour tickets in advance, since we were driving a considerable distance. Upon entering the Park, we experienced a pleasant drive lined by trees. We spotted both turkeys and deer feeding alongside the entrance road, despite it being early afternoon. We arrived and, after a quick bathroom break, started our Historic Tour.Historic Tour - 2 starsThe two star rating is not directly attributable to this particular section of cave, but to the tour experience itself. I would rate this section of cave three stars. We found ourselves in a group of about 115 people, of which a good portion were young children. Unfortunately, many of these children proved to be ill-behaved, which detracted from the overall tour experience. We followed our tour guide, Heather, closely, staying at the head of our group and hoping to not miss any tidbits or running commentary she could provide during the tour. Unfortunately, she was mostly silent between scheduled stops. While Heather was polite enough, she didn't overly impress with her knowledge of the cave nor her passion for her job. This could have been attributable to having to put up day in and day out with the type of behavior we witnessed from both children and adults alike while on our tour: Children kept surging ahead of Heather down the passageway, despite her repeated warnings not to do so, while the parents, who followed closely behind, seemed largely unconcerned. The group overall was so loud, even at scheduled stops, that we could barely hear Heather's speeches despite being so near her. At one point we stopped near the Giant's Coffin to experience a moment of complete darkness - something I had been talking up to my companions, since I had experienced this on a childhood trip to Mammoth and it had left a lasting impression. However, during this 30 seconds of darkness many nearby teens and adults alike felt it important to check their cell phones (in a cave, no less), completely ruining the experience. I could still see my hand faintly in front of my face. The most interesting sections of this tour consisted of Fat Man's Misery and the Mammoth Dome. The second half of the tour contained much more interesting sights than did the first half (Broadway Avenue). Although this was labeled the Historic Tour, I wouldn't classify it as a very educational experience, and would definitely not recommend it if it will be your only tour experience of Mammoth. Be warned that although the Historic Tour is listed as 2 miles in length, this total includes .4 miles of above ground hiking trail from the Visitor Center to the Historic Entrance to the cave.River Styx Spring Trail - 4 starsImmediately after finishing our Historic Tour, we headed down the River Styx Spring Trail. We hadn't had time to pick up a map from the Visitor Center prior to the start of our first tour, so we weren't hiking with a plan. We ended up traveling to the end of the trail, which culminated in a view of the River Styx flowing over a small waterfall into the Green River. The hike was incredibly peaceful, and we found ourselves marveling along the way at the various locust trees of incredible size. We enjoyed resting on the benches provided which overlook the waterfall where the River Styx empties into the Green River. We returned to the Visitor Center via the same route that we had come.Star Chamber Lantern Tour - 5 starsAfter obtaining a map of all of the different tour routes from the Visitor Center (something notably missing from the Mammoth Cave website), we were sorely disappointed to discover that while the Star Chamber Lantern Tour advertised a very different tour experience from the Historic Tour, it covered most of the same route. Still, we had pre-purchased our tickets, so we were more or less already committed. Our tour guide's name was Steve, and he completely blew us away with his knowledge of the cave and the surrounding area. Our tour group was much smaller this time around, topping out at 40 people. Additionally, there is a 6 and up age restriction for this tour, which we were most grateful for after our earlier experience. We hiked the same .2 mile trail from the Visitor Center to the Historic Entrance, this time with lanterns in hand. We were wondering how much different this tour would be from the Historic, and we were impressed right away after reaching the Rotunda. Steve's speeches at each stop were much longer than were those given on the Historic tour, and his knowledge was superb. The group was small and proved to be good listeners. The frequency of stops was higher than that on the Historic, and viewing the cave by lantern provided a completely different experience. Steve brought several cave features to our attention that we had completely missed the first time through, including chisel marks left on the walls from the pre-Columbian natives who mined gypsum from the cave. The Star Chamber itself lived up to the hype, and provided a very neat experience. Steve read a poem written by Ralph Waldo Emerson, describing his experience in the Star Chamber years ago. On the return trip, we took a side trip to visit Gothic Avenue and the Bridal Altar, both awe-inspiring. Steve proved to be the perfect tour guide and an excellent story-teller. He kept us engaged for the entire tour and really made the history of the cave come to life. He is a true asset to the NPS and we hope he continues guiding tours for many years to come. I would not recommend the Historic Tour if you only have time for one or two tours of Mammoth Cave. It has a somewhat commercialized feel, skips many of the unique features of the cave, the tour guides are forced to focus more on crowd control than on anything else, and your experience is largely at the mercy of those traveling with you. If we were to do it over again I would have chosen the Domes and Dripstones in combination with either the Star Chamber Lantern Tour or the Violet City Lantern Tour. When I had visited Mammoth as a child, my family and I had traversed the Snowball Chamber Tour, which is no longer offered. We were told that the Snowball Chamber and Grand Avenue Tours were no longer available due to cuts to the NPS budget stemming from the 2013 federal budget sequestration. Be sure to bring a sweatshirt or jacket for the cool 55 degree cave temperatures, and I'd recommend leaving your camera behind, as flash photography is no longer permitted. There are public-use lockers available in the pavilion where tours meet prior to departing, and there is a penny-press machine located on the first floor of the Hotel, just outside the gift shop.","May 17, 2014",Tour Type Critical to Mammoth Cave Experience,47,"Sturgis, Michigan, United States",4
Mammoth Cave,"There are two parks in one here. While the cave is the main attraction the surface park has hiking and biking trails that could easily reward a day if you want to. But, it's the caves that brought you here. Access to the caves is only by guided tour and I agree with the poster who suggested planning and buying ahead. We did the 'historic cave"" tour and ""Domes and Drip Stones"". These are two entirely different experiences and both are highly rewarding. Some of the other tours overlap material included in these tours so read the descriptions carefully to avoid duplication. Pay attention to the tour descriptions. Some of the tours are strenuous and once you've started you are committed for the duration. Ask yourself if closed spaces are a problem because some of the passageways are TIGHT. Allow some time to read the background material in the modern visitor center exhibits. You'll learn a lot. Allocate at least a day here... anything less and you are cheating yourself. You could easily spend more time and never be bored... especially if you put in any time on the surface park. We stayed overnight in Cave City but if we come back we'll certainly consider the on-site lodge. In addition to the usual souvenir shop there is a separate shop selling the work of fine traditional Kentucky craftsmen & women.","May 17, 2014",Worthy of the Name,68,Baltimore,5
Mammoth Cave,"EXCELLENT!! If you are looking for some underground experience, Mammoth Caves National Park is the place to visit. First stop is the Visitors Center. Everything you will need to know about the park and tours starts here including purchasing the tour tickets. All of the tours we went on were great. The Tour Guides are fantastic and knowledgeable (they are great). The tours are limited in size so consider making your reservations before your arrive. A few suggestions from our experience: (1) the temperature in the caves is cool so you may want to bring a light jacket, (2) wear good walking or hiking shoes/boots not sandals or flip flops, (3) for those taller than 5'8"" you may want to wear a cushioned hat or bicycle helmet on some of the tours to avoid some ""ouch"" moments especially on the Historic and Domes and Dripstones tours, (4) Flash photography is not allowed so you may want to leave your camera in the car, (5) food and drink (except for water) are not allowed to be consumed in the caves, and (6) there is very little shade in the parking lot so if you bring your dog you will have to leave your car windows wide open. Also, there is a kennel at the hotel where you can rent a small run. It's unsupervised so you must bring your own dog food. There is a pretty decent restaurant at the Mammoth Caves Hotel. Cell phone service in the park is almost non-existant. There is free WiFi in the Visitors Center. There are some excellent hiking trails from easy to difficult. All-in-all, we spent 3 days visiting Mammoth Caves and had a wonderful and educational experience.","May 16, 2014",Mammoth Enjoyment at Mammoth Caves,22,,5
Mammoth Cave,"I would find it challenging to visit Mammoth Caves and not spend at least one entire day here. There is so much to do! First, I highly recommend planning your trip in advance so you know exactly what you want to do and when you want to do it. You can buy some tickets online but not all of them. Be aware that tour guides can come in an buy up an entire time slot. Even though we were about 10th in line, we still didn’t get our first pick of tours because that happened to us. While I appreciate the needs that tour groups have, there has to be a better way to make it all work. We waited in line for 45 minutes before the Caves opened, then the guide strolled in after it opened and walked right to the front of the line. The person at our ticket desk was very helpful and we were able to trade our pre-purchased tickets for other time slots and make it all work, but it’s still a hassle.We first did the Cedar Sink hike (separate review) and then the Frozen Niagara Tour. If you’re looking for a colorful tour, this is the one to take. It had a plethora of stalactites and stalagmites and other drip formations. We even saw one little bat. Our 5 yo was convinced that he was terrified of bats prior to the visit, but once he saw that tiny fuzzy bat, he changed his tune. Loves bats now. I don’t recall his name, but our guide was great.We also did the Mammoth Passage tour. You can’t buy advance tickets for this one. It leaves from the cave main entrance, so don’t bother walking down to check out the entrance separately like we did. This one was led by Ranger Rick (yes, Ranger Rick), who was also excellent. We saw two more little bats here. Mammoth Passage was awesome in a completely different way than the Frozen Niagara tour. It is barren of any decorative formations but overwhelming in size. It’s hard to believe that these two hikes are part of the same cave system.","May 15, 2014",Frozen Niagara and Mammoth Passage Tours,388,"Grand Rapids, MI",4

Mammoth Cave,"We did the domes and dripstones tour. This is marked as a moderate tour, probably because of the 200+ stairs on the way down....but it really isn't difficult. Once you're too the bottom you have a large area to sit on benches, rest for a minute and ask questions. Then you start your journey across a 3/4 mile area ending in the frozen Niagra. Not too many steps up and you take a set or two then walk for a while and repeat. This wasn't nearly as taxing a walk as they lead us to believe it would be. This was my first cave experience and I thoroughly enjoyed it.","May 14, 2014",Domes & Dripstones,30,Middleburg,5
Mammoth Cave,"I have always wanted to come here, and I am so glad that I did!! We only had one day to spend at this National Park, and it was a great day. We took the Historic tour of the cave, which is about 2 hours long. We started off in this amazing rotunda...I had no idea a cave could be that huge! The tour guide said that was only the 6th biggest room in the whole cave! We went through Fat Man's Misery, we saw the Bottomless Pit, and all kinds of other stuff. It was definitely worth it! People of all ages will enjoy this tour! They warn you ahead of time that if you are claustrophobic or scared of heights or have any kind of health problem that will prevent you from being able to climb stairs and stuff that you should not enter the cave. They said it would take many hours to get medical help in there should something go wrong, and after having been in the cave, I can see why they would strongly advise you ahead of time!We spent the rest of the day driving around the park on some scenic drives, and took a fun little ferry across the river. If we had another day to spend there, I definitely would have gone on another cave tour, but I think that one day was absolutely perfect.I strongly recommend booking your tour tickets online ahead of time. I didn't really think that all of the tours would be booked up when we got there, but most of them actually were. We actually ended up changing our tour time to an earlier one, and I had to forfeit 6 dollars to get the tickets changed.

This is a smaller tour so its more personal and the time flew and it only felt like less than an hour. I was sad to see it come to an end. We will most definitely be back and we will most definitely request whatever tour Michael is giving.

It was so nice and cool in the cave that even though it was in the high 80s outside I was wearing a sweater inside the cave.

Mammoth Cave,"First, let me say that the cave itself was wonderful! We took a field trip and our kids loved the cave. However, we had an issue with them booking our school trip with another group of older people and therefore they did not have enough tickets for all our parents. The rangers and supervisors were very rude and unaccommodating. And the other people who were with our group didn't seem to enjoy being with a rowdy group of first graders, which was understandable. But this was incredibly poor planning on the part of the cave staff- seems to me a school tour should be reserved for that school if you offer it as such. (However, I was told rudely that this was clearly an ""unrealized assumption"" when I mentioned this to the staff supervisor.) They offer field trips, but they were unable to accommodate us and the main tour guide seemed very annoyed by our kids. Our other tour guide, James, was incredible- very patient and super helpful!

Mammoth Cave,"Visited in the ""early"" season so was lucky to only have a group of 25 with no waiting. There are quite a few different tours of the caves, different skill levels, lengths & times. All very reasonably priced. I did ""Domes & Dripstones"" which is rated as easy. There are a few quite narrow passages at the beginning but there is a handrail anywhere that might be a hazard for slipping. I'm 5'6"" and there were only a few places I had to duck my head. Total length of walking/stairs is 0.75 miles but there are about 3 places to stop along the way. The park ranger was very educated & informative, pretty impressive! This tour lasted exactly 2 hours as stated, which includes transportation to the cave entrance & back. This would be a great family tour with older kids/teens.","May 1, 2014",Try it!,98,"Prince Albert, Canada",5
Mammoth Cave,The Mammoth Cave system consists of over 400 miles of underground caves that are linked together. Originally discovered over a century ago and the exploration is still continuing today. However only a small percentage is available for public tours. The National Park Services offers several different types of daily cave tours. Amazing history! There is even a cave tour made especially for young children that are interested in cave exploration.You must be in reasonably good health because of the number of stairs and changes in elevations as you descend and ascend from these caves. Also bring a light jacket because the caves are a constant 55 degrees F and no food will be permitted only a bottle of water will be allowed. Suggest you bring a small LED pocket flashlight.There is also a Mammoth Cave Hotel and restaurant on site that is near the Visitor Center and Cave Entrance.,"April 30, 2014",Transport yourself back in time,9,"Paramus, New Jersey",4
Mammoth Cave,"Some tips to ensure you have a great time:1. Don't go during the summer. It is too busy. And if you go then, don't complain about wait times! :)2. Pack a lunch and enjoy great outdoors and trails too not just the caves.3. Carefully research which tour to take.4. Make it a day excursion so you don't feel rushed. You will then have time to take a few tours. 5. Book tours ahead of time. They sell out when it is busy. 6. Relax and appreciate the beauty. 7. Wear comfy shoes and clothing.8. Try and stay as near guides as you can so you can hear their commentary.9. Get there early enough so you can go through the museum first before your tour.","April 30, 2014",Trip Tips to enhance your experience.,8,Waterloo,5

Mammoth Cave,"My fiancé and I started the morning with the Historic Tour and came back in the late afternoon for Domes and Dripstones Tour. These two hour tours were a great pair of fairly easy paths through very different areas of the cave. The historic tour was full of artifacts and interesting stories along with not to be missed classics like tall man's and fat man's misery. The domes tour included the iconic frozen niagara and more scenic parts of the cave. Both had mostly paved paths but a few spots with sharp inclines, tight squeezes and tons of stairs. Book your tours online before you leave your home. If you're interested in the Violet City Lamp Tour (as we were) book even earlier as this 40 person tour sells out much faster than the 120 capped larger tours. In addition to the different sights that can be seen, there are different tour options as well based on length and difficulty. For families with children I highly recommend the shorter Frozen Niagara tour. On both our tours this trip there were children who had long lost interest in the underworld.While in the park check out the free ferry rides crossing the Green River. Although shorter than most bridges, this is a very unique feature that's worth detouring. For food the park offerings at the hotel are slim but there's not much in nearby Cave City either. Packing a picnic might be the best option and to add to the park atmosphere.","April 28, 2014",Spend a Few Hours Underground,82,"Columbus, Ohio",5

Mammoth Cave,"We booked our historic cave tour on line. Be aware folks that the National park is just across the time zone line so check when your tour is to begin! we had to wait an hour for our tour, but actually that is about enough time to mosey through the visitor center displays so it worked out for the best. The cave itself is interesting if not a bit dark and barren compared to Luray caverns which we visited last year. Be aware that the cave tour is not for the very large or very tall or those who don't like to hike. I am 6'4 and had a heck of a time on some parts of the tour. I wish I had brought a hard hat. The guide we had was excellent and shared quite a few stories about the cave and early exploration of the area. definitely worth the time to visit if you are in the area. the tour took about 2 hours.

Mammoth Cave,"I camped here with 3 of my children (ages 7, 9, and 14) in April 2014. I have been here before but it was some of my children's first trip. The cave tours were great - we did the Domes and Dripstones and the Historic Tour. I wish the groups were not so large - would be nice to ask questions of the guides and be a more intimate tour of the cave (very difficult to get 100+ people to be perfectly quiet even for 20 seconds to simulate a wild cave) but I suppose this is the most efficient way to get the public thru the caves. Our guides (and volunteers - 1 guide, 1 volunteer per tour) were pleasant and helpful as were the staff at the visitor's center. It was a little disappointing that some of the features have to be fenced off inside the cave (to keep people from defacing/breaking them). The tours do sell out which surprised me (especially for the time of year) - I had wanted to do the Starlight tour and my children wanted to do the Trog tour but these were sold out for several weekends (they are only offered on weekends). My advice? Plan ahead if there is a tour you really want to go on.","April 23, 2014","Natural wonders, wonderful park",36,west central ohio,4
Mammoth Cave,We explored Mammoth Cave on the Domes and Dripstones tour. Our entire family loved it. I was concerned about taking my 4 and 6 year old sons on a 2 hour underground tour. They loved it and we all navigated the stairs and openings easily. I was debating between Frozen Niagara and Domes and Dripstones and I'm so glad to have chosen the latter. There initial descent down the stairs was truly awesome. I'm very claustrophobic and was very concerned about the narrow passages. I did not feel cramped at all. I was completely relaxed and comfortable. Great experience.,"April 22, 2014",Amazing cave experience with small children,17,,5
Mammoth Cave,"Our Frozen Niagra tour was over within forty-five minutes, which, given the dour guide ranger may have been best.

It's not as extensive as the other tours but it was a great introduction of what it looks like inside a cave after the waters have cleaned it out. It was just enough for a family with young children. They have a very nice area set up inside the Visitor center that explains the history here along with some nice photos. The park rangers are very friendly and informative. There are several hiking trails which we enjoyed. If you want to take the other tours plan to get tickets ahead of time or early in the am as we noticed that most of the tours were completely booked for the day.

Mammoth Cave,"We just spent the weekend at Mammoth Cave National Park. we had the most wonderful time. We arrived on Friday around 10:30 and registered for the Domes & Dripstones Tour. THe guide Joe Duvall had extensive knowledge of the cave and our tour. The tour includes a series of domes and pits, typical large trunk passageways, and a short journey through numerous dripstone formations. On Sunday we returned and took the Historic tour, guided by Michael. This was a really fun and informative tour. I would recommend taking the historic first and then the Domes & Dripstones. The visitor center is very nice and there is always someone around to answer any question. Be sure to shop at the ""Park"" gift shop as it is managed by a non profit company and the proceeds go to the park. The park as a whole is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone.","April 21, 2014",Trip to Mammoth Cave,28,South Bend,5
Mammoth Cave,"First Timers....We took the 2 hour tour called Domes and Dripstones (previously called the New Entrance tour) Kath was our guide and Joe was our follow-up guy. As we went thru the little closet entrance ...as we descended I started to get a little claustrophobic because the stairs were very small and the area was also very small, but kept trudging along until we got to a larger room. Phew....couldn't think about where we were...so far underground, but after a while it was fine. Kath was extremely knowledgeable, and since our group was small- only around 30 people which made it really nice for control and questions. Joe kept us in line ... couldn't stop too long to take pictures, but we did manage a few that I am downloading. An awesome experience and we hope to come back and do some of the other tours. This was a moderate tour - we are both over 60 and in fairly good health. It was only slightly strenuous ... the only problem is that my husband didn't duck as quick and low as he should have a few times, so his souvenir was a few scrapes on his head (and he had a hat on!) The walk thru displays in the visitors center were also very nice - we went thru before and then after and enjoyed it both times.","April 20, 2014",A little spooky and then....WOW!,116,"Manton, Michigan",5

Mammoth Cave,"We have been here twice now. The first time we came here (a few years ago), we went on the Historic Tour. We showed up, bought tickets, and went on our trip. We took lots of pictures (with flash) This time was much different. We showed up in the morning to buy our tickets, but all tours were booked until later that day. That was more our fault for not checking up on the specifics before hand. The tour was visually stimulating, however, I am only giving it 3 stars because 1.) they changed their policy and you can no longer take photos with flash. All my photos turned out dark or not at all. and 2.) they rush you through the cave in HUGE groups. Our tour group was so big, we didn't hear everything our guide was saying. We were a bit closer to the front of the group as we were told if we were in the front of the group we will go slower, and if we were in the back, it will be a much faster pace. Everyone was friendly enough, but they need to stop being so greedy. It seems like they just push as many people as they can through the doors just to make money. It doesn't seem like they care about making sure each person learned something or even heard the tour guide. In conclusion, this place is just beautiful. I will visit here again.

The tour was sold out so get your tickets early in the day. After a short bus ride to the new entrance we started the tour by descending a really lot of steps. Although I haven't done the historic tour for many years, I think this one has a lot more steps. I'm average height and I had to do a lot of ducking and stooping throughout the tour. Its also quite wet but we loved it. The formations are fabulous and you get a great look at the natural structures of the cave.

Get your reservations or you will not have much choice on what tour you get! I ended up on the historic tour, and was not disappointed at all. The views were incredible, the tour guides were very professional and most of all my whole group was happy.Whoever rated this place lower than a 4 must have had problems with reservations and trying to get on a tour, because there is no way you could not like it. My group had about 85 people, and everyone left smiling. One thing, if your a photographer want to be, then you better be fast, because they move you quickly through places, and there is a lead guide and a catcher in the rear and they keep things flowing. There were some steps in this, actually quite a lot, so if that is a problem for you, better think of another tour. But our group had a guy with a cane and a couple that were well into their 70's and they made it, although the husband was a little slow up that last bunch of stairs.Just remember one thing RESERVATIONS!!!!!!Make them early, and I mean days or a week or 2 early online or you might not get the tour you want!!!

Mammoth Cave,"I visited in early April a week after the Kentucky kids had their spring break so the park really wasn't that crowded at all. It was a mother/daughter trip with my 12 year old. It was her first time in a cave. We started with the ""Domes & Dripstones"" tour which is at the new entrance to the cave. This tour starts with a bus ride to the new entrance and from their you descend many steep, twisting stairs that would be difficult to navigate for taller or heavier people due to the narrowness of the openings and low hanging rock formation. Once you reach the bottom the hike is much easier and the cave rooms are fairly large. Don't expect to see a lot of living cave formations here until you get to the very end of the tour. There is a bus ride back to the visitor's center. The second tour we took was the Violet City Lantern tour. It is a smaller group and about every 4th person carries a lantern. The tour starts by walking in the main entrance by the visitor's center and ends with a short bus ride back. For a short time we were in the very front of the group and I was carrying the lead lantern. This was the darkest place to be and caused some dizziness for my daughter in the low light on uneven footing. We found it was better for us to be in the middle or toward the end of the group so we could benefit from the light of the other hikers' lanterns to guide our way. Because of the low light it is hard to see the details around you. The rooms are very large and the hike is very long (3 hours, 3 miles in the dark). Do yourself a favor and use the bathroom before this tour! As with any tour your experience will vary depending on the guide's expertise and the manners of the guests around you. I wouldn't recommend the violet city lantern tour to the very young as there is not much to see to keep kids interested for the whole 3 hours. If you have any vertigo/dizziness issues this may not be a good choice either due to the flickering lantern lights. Overall, the park is wonderful and probably any of the tours would be worth going on but I would supplement one of the Mammoth Cave tours with a quick trip to Diamond Caverns - a privately owned cave near the edge of the National park. Diamond Caverns is a ""wet"" cave that is much smaller and not as deep as Mammoth Cave but the small tour size and the fabulous formations underground are not to be missed!","April 11, 2014",New Entrance (Domes & Dripstones) & Violet City Lantern Tour,96,"Milford, Michigan",5

On the surface we took walks by the Cedar Sink Tail and one down by the river. It was a fun trip with great exercise, too. One caveat - do NOT eat in the hotel dining room.

Mammoth Cave,"We loved the ""domes and dripstones"" tour, but I feel it was a bit misleading. Most of the tour is NOT seeing the stalagmites and stalactites, but just seeing caverns underground. The dripstones come at the very end of the tour, and you need to walk down an extra 98 steps to see them. If you have asthma or are afraid of the dark, this would not be a good tour for you. Also, if you are very obese or very tall, you may have difficulty navigating some of the steps going down into the cave.

Mammoth Cave,"We visit many national and state parks to learn about the world around us. As the largest cave system in the world, this was on our list of must-do things to do with our kids and we decided to do it during Spring Break. I had looked online before we left and saw that there were many tickets left, so I didn't book any in advance. We got there on a cold and rainy Saturday afternoon and booked a tour for Sunday. We also picked up Junior Ranger books for the kids to fill out as we do at many parks. Kids all have different interests and learn in different ways, so we all enjoy the Junior Ranger program. Wish they had that when I did the parks with my parents 30+ years ago.It's wonderful that there is no entrance fee to the park and the only charge is for the tours. Those charges are very reasonable and we're happy to pay them to help support our park system. Loved the tours, seeing what was hidden underground. Our 9 and 11 year old easily handled a 2 hour tour with lots of walking, stooping and stairs. It was so impressive and truly awesome.My only complaint would be that I think the tour size was too large. As we walked we were somewhat spread out. Even though we were in the first third of the group, we would sometimes miss what the guide was saying. For anyone going during warmer weather I would highly recommend getting your tickets online in advance. We went at a time that wasn't as busy, but some tours were already sold out.

Mammoth Cave,"A good experience if you like caves. Must be physically able to walk and bend. They warned us before going that if we had a medical emergency while in the cave that it would take hours to get us out to a medical facility. We took the Historic Tour which was 2 miles, 2 hours. We climbed 440 stairs and walked quite a bit up hills and many times in very dark areas. Take a small flashlight. Difficulty: Moderate. There are no restrooms in the cave, so if you can't wait 2 hours before ""going"", beware. Don't go if you have back problems or shortness of breath. The tour guide was very good, but there were long periods of just walking with no information. Our group was too large. Most of the time, our guide stopped and stood on a rock and spoke very loudly so that everyone could hear, but those in the back did miss a little at times.The cave was cold, so take a jacket. Also be sure to wear good sturdy shoes. Forget the cute shoes for this tour!Very important-Research ahead of time to get scheduled times for tours. Reservations are recommended. There are at least 11 different tours that depart on different days and at different times. Some are offered only on Sat. and Sun. Certain tours have age limits. The park is open year round except for Christmas. There is a Trog tour for kids 8-12 yrs. old. They get to hike, crawl and belly-slide through the cave. It is 2 3/4 hrs. long. Parents must attend the first 30 minutes of the tour to help the child ""suit up"" with their equipment. website-nps.gov/maca or call the park directly at 270-758-2180There is a very nice visitor center and a campground near the cave. They offer cabins to rent. There is also a hotel (built in 1816) and a restaurant. They have several gift shops. It was very nice and interesting. An ATM is located in the Mammoth Cave Hotel. Caver's Camp Store offers camping and picnic supplies. They have a self-service laundry service at the camp store with 2 washers and 2 dryers. There is also a post office behind the camp store. For reservations to hotel, call 270-758-2225. There is so much to do and see. I had no idea what to expect until I got there.If you are 63 years old or older and like to visit national parks, purchase a National Park pass. Many times this pass allows you get in free.

Don't miss the trails above ground--they are beautiful, too--and very quiet since most of the traffic is inside the cave.

Mammoth Cave,"My boyfriend and I went on the Domes and Dripstones tour. It was 99% families with small children, which wasn't exactly a problem... but it caused our tour to travel at a much slower rate. The first 90% of the tour is climbing around through the dry, dormant, part of the cave which is basically a variety of piled rocks. The very last part of the tour, we got to the Frozen Niagra. This part looked magnificent, however we were completely RUSHED through. The ranger told us, ""We were supposed to be out of this cave 5 minutes ago, so keep moving."" This was the only part of the cave worth capturing on camera and we were scolded for attempting to take pictures and told to keep walking. The tour guide was overly rude and we were very disappointed with our experience.","April 2, 2014",Gettin' Unlucky in Kentucky,9,"Chicago, Illinois",1
Mammoth Cave,"Overall, this was worth the visit. It was neat to see how large the cave complex is in the area. I went on the ""new entrance"" tour (or whatever they are calling it these days). The tour started out with a bus ride to the secluded entrance (looked like going out in the woods to a creepy bunker to me). Then quite a few very narrow stairs down in a sinkhole. At the bottom it looked more like a mine to me than a cave. Then there are more stairs and a dirt and concrete pathway that is narrow at times to the end where the best part of the cave is located, actual stalagmites and stalactites. The trip then abruptly ended as you walk out of the cave. Overall about a two hour tour. It was worth it, but not as spectacular as other caves I have seem. The park services does a nice job with the cave and tour though. Go if in the area, don't make a separate trip though.","April 1, 2014",Seemed Like a Mix Between a Cave and a Mine,62,Virginia,4

It was .75 miles and with a lot of steps going down, but it was the highlight of their trip! The park visitor center is so clean and the museum on site is so interesting. We are not athletes and it gave us a work out but very doable. The rangers were so knowledgeable, I would defiantly go back and do it again.

This is the longest cavern in the world and it is very fascinating to explore. The first tour was mildly strenuous and some of the trail was very constricted. Those with claustrophobia should avoid this tour. The history of mans use of this cave is interesting and our guide did an outstanding job of presenting in an entertaining and informative fashion. It would be a shame to pass through this part of Kentucky and miss seeing this epic wonder of the world.,"March 29, 2014",Very Good Cave Experience,2,"Klamath Falls, Oregon",4

Mammoth Cave,"We were on a road trip from Houston and wanted to hit as many National Parks as possible. Mammoth Cave was great, and I'm so glad we stopped. Some things I did not find in my research prior:- They do have very inexpensive kennels if you're traveling with pets, but note the kennels are outdoor. You can bring toys, blankets, food/dishes, whatever your pet may need for these self-serve kennels. Stop by the hotel front desk to rent a lock. I think it was a $10 rental for the lock (refunded upon return of the lock) and only a couple bucks to access the kennels for our 2 dogs. - We did the Domes & Dripstones tour. It has about 500 steps (280 are downhill) and several hills on the path. I am in terrible shape, but I did it. The first part is down, down, down some very narrow passages (not too narrow for someone quite heavy like me, but I caution you in case you are claustrophobic). You gradually work your way back up. Also, you enter at the top of the hill, but the bus picks you up at the base of the hill so you don't have as much climbing to do getting back out. What a relief - it is a LONG way down. I was sore for a few days after, but nothing I couldn't manage. Just used to flat coastal plains!- The cave tour we were on had only a few formations. It was nothing like some of the gorgeous wet caves in TX. There were a few formations toward the end (another optional 50 steps down and up), but the tour focused on the formation of the cave & the size of the cave. Still a good tour - definitely recommend. The guide was fun.- The pace was perfect. Hills and steps till I was good and tired, then we took a seat and listened to the ranger talk. By then I was rested up for the next set of hills and steps. Just wear good walking shoes. - Not many bats left here. They are dying of white nose syndrome. Anything you take into this cave should not go in to other caves.- In busier times of year, be sure to buy tickets in advance. It was a cold day in early March with wintry mix falling and a freeze expected the coming night, and we didn't have problems that day buying same-day tickets at 1pm for the 1:45 tour, but I hear they often sell out.","March 28, 2014",Great experience!,57,Houston,4

The guide was knowledgable and funny and the cave was a wonder! I did sprain my ankle going up the stairs so make sure to watch your step. We were going to do the domes and drip stones tour too but I had to get a refund. We will definitely go back and try again, though!","March 26, 2014",really neat!,15,"Mount Pleasant, South Carolina",5

Mammoth Cave,"We thoroughly enjoyed two tours: The Historic Tour and the New Entrance (Now called Domes & DripStones) Tour, both which were about 2 hours and 2 miles each. Each provides a much different perspective of the cave.

Mammoth Cave,"My daughter and I arrived on Sunday afternoon. We did not book tickets in advance because I was not certain of travel time to the area. We arrived at the visitor center around 1pm and got tickets for the 1:45pm Historic Tour. I would guess there were around 70 people on our tour. Our tour started at Shelter 1, led by 2 Park Rangers. After a short explanation on the history of MCNP and rules on the tour, we left for our walk down hill to the Cave entrance. Our Ranger was very informative and had a great sense of humor. We would walk for a while, then stop to gather up and listen to our Ranger talk about what we were seeing and experiencing. I think if you are at the front of the group (or maybe at the rear with the 2nd Ranger) you hear extra info about the cave system. If in the middle of the group I think you only will hear what is said during a group stop. The tour lasted about 2hrs. I found the tour fascinating. You can take photos, but no flash photography is allowed. So make use of the lighting as you are walking along to get photos of the cave itself, or of somebody in your group. I did not find the walking or climbing very strenuous, but there are parts of the tour that are a bit of a challenge to navigate. And the last set of steps straight up will get your heart pounding. And once you are out of the cave and walk over the shoe cleaning solution, you also have to walk back up to the Parks visitor center and parking lot. Overall the Cave tour was a blast and I would do other tours on future visits.","March 21, 2014",1st time visitor. Loved it!,267,"iowa city, ia",5
Mammoth Cave,"Booked our tickets online a few weeks ago for “Domes & Dripstones Tour” (Formerly known as the New Entrance Tour). I booked an afternoon tour but we ended up arriving in the morning. It was $3 per ticket to change tickets to a morning tour so be aware of that. Realistically this was a tour offered many times a day and it was a Tuesday in the off season so it probably did not make sense to book online ahead of time unless it is a tour that is only offered a few times per day. There were 26 in our tour and Jerry our guide said he had as many as 125. After meeting at Shelter B, a bus took us to the entrance and we started our descent. There are lockers at the shelter where you can leave a backpack or purse but it is just as easy to leave it in your trunk. Our guide was from that area and had a rich family history which made the tour even more special. My boys 10 and 14 loved this tour. They enjoyed squeezing and ducking through the cave walls as we made our way down the stairs. After the bus brought us back to the Visitor Center, we had lunch in the restaurant. The choices were limited but it was reasonability priced and quickly prepared. We hiked around the Visitor Center when we were done before leaving for our next stop. There are tons of hiking and biking trails in the area so you definitely could spend an entire day or two taking in the area. The Visitor Center is well done too and interesting to read about the history of the cave. Don’t forget to stamp your National Passport books in the gift shop. The 1991 stamp set has Mammoth Cave stamp on it. Both sons said “5 ½ stars” when we were leaving the park.","March 18, 2014",5 1/2 stars per boys 10 and 14,168,"Kansas City, Missouri",5

We were hoping for the Wild Cave tour but those only run on the weekends in the summer months and they book up quickly. We ended up with the Historical Tour and the Frozen Niagara Tour. On the Historical Tour it was interesting to learn about how the caves were used in the past. The park ranger was quite knowledgeable. Because of the size of the rooms we were in we were able to gather around the ranger and here the stories. For the second tour, because the passage ways were much narrower you didn't hear any stories unless you were right at the front.

The Rangers were extremely friendly and knowledgeable and helpful. There is the Historic tour which entitles steps and tight places and the Frozen Niagara which had a lot of formations and easier to handle. It was beautiful and very informative, really worth the visit.

Don't go down if can't carry a child for up past two hours.Take food and drink that can be carried in small bag or pockets as backpacks not allowed down in caves. Floors can be sloppy, historical tour also has lots of steps, very narrow passageways and low ceilings. They don't tell you this before ticket purchase. Beware. Carrying our little one in some of these areas was hairy but not an issue for us. Just a warning to others. Price was fair for 2hr tour. Information given by guide lacked details on history at times and focused on some events too much. Balance was a little off at times from what you can find online. Not a problem and we did learn a couple of things. A good day out where one or two improvements could make it great.","March 7, 2014",Nice day trip,93,"Cribbs Causeway, United Kingdom",4

One thing that I should have thought of was bringing a jacket or sweater. Even though it was really warm outside of the cave, it was close to 50 in the cave. Big change from warm Kentucky weather. I highly recommend going to this park. However, don't go in expecting formations, stalagmites, and stalactites. It is very cavernous, but none of the typical formations one may find in a cave such as Carlsbad Caverns. If you enjoy history, this cave is a great place to visit.

Mammoth Cave,"For those with small children, we have a 2 year old and a 6 month old. We also met my sister's family at the park, and she has four boys ranging from 5 to 11. We visited in the off season, so our tour options were limited. We did the Historic Tour on our first day, and outside of Fat Man's Misery, were a little underwhelmed. This tour doesn't have much in the way of impressive cave formations, so the older boys weren't too excited. Our 2 year old was mostly worked up that we left his flashlight in the car, so we had an exhausting time trying to reign him in.The next day we did the New Entrance Tour. Everyone from the adult on down were far more impressed. The initial descent was really fun, although the park ranger at the rear of the pack did scold us once because my 2 year old insisted on taking some of the steps himself and we were slowing things down. The ranger stories that accompanied this trip were more interesting as well. All the boys got excited by the Frozen Niagara portion of the trip since they wanted to see ""real"" cave formations (so much so that we strongly considered going to another cave that day, except I'm a national park purist who wanted to keep it in-park).Notes on bringing children: There were far more young children on the Historic tour, so we basically blended in with all the noise they generate. Our kids were by far the youngest on the New Entrance tour the day we went, so I'm sure we stood out more to others. Our baby was in a Moby wrap and slept through most of the tours. The 2 year old was harder to contain on the New Entrance Tour, but having a flashlight he could control helped because these aren't the best lit caves in the world.","February 18, 2014",New Entrance and Historic Tours (with small children),6,"Helena, Montana",4
Mammoth Cave,"If you drive from Indianapolis to Nashville or vice versa, you'll be kicking yourselves if you're not stopping here. Its just a short distance from interstate. Worth to stop by and take a tour. I took the New Entrance tour (which could be by another name) that is moderate (there's Easy, Moderate and Hard tour). I don't think the tour is moderate. Its quite easy. Bus drop us at the new entrance to the cave. Climb down stairs to the huge cave. And then walk walk walk. Then another huge cave. Ranger turn off the light to let us experience the darkness and the silence. Walk walk walk. There's optional 98 stairs to below to check out a small cave. Its very easy to climb and up. After that, it was ended. I was like, ""what?, moderate, come on"". But two of my friend to came with me are having cramp leg the next day. I'm not sure why I don't have such issue. I just think Moderate for this cave tour is easy. You should just go for moderate cave tour or else I think you'll be left disappoint if you go for Easy Tour. The tour fee is $12. You can bring water bottle in. But believe me, its not that tiring and you don't need to drink water due to exhaustion.

Mammoth Cave,"Read this review knowing I've been spoiled by having been to Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico. I read several other reviews of cave attractions in the area (the zip line one), but thought it would be better to give my dollars to the National Parks. I was glad I did. You don't have to pay an entry fee to get in the park which was a pleasant surprise. You also don't have to pay to park, so you can spend the day in the park for no money at all. The only thing that I saw you have to pay to enjoy are the cave tours, a back country permit or the on site hotel. The facility here is beautiful. I heard the ranger say it was three years old. There are indoor bathrooms, a very small gift shop and plenty of hiking trails and shelters to picnic. I made my reservation for the ""historic"" tour online a week ahead of time. When I arrived, the helpful ranger pulled up my reservation and I had my ticket with no problems at all. In the two hours before my tour started, I was able to hike a few of the trails. It was a beautiful, unusually mild February day. I'm not an avid hiker and didn't come prepared to hike. I just had water, a jacket and tennis shoes. I did fine on the main trails around the visitor center. The trail to the river was a challenge on the way up the hill for me, but a good workout. The historic cave tour itself started with warnings about health, claustrophobia and minding your children. All three warnings were for good reason. There were about 4-5 areas of the tour where at 5' 3"", I had to crouch. Tall people, be warned. There was also an area of the tour (""Fat Man's Misery"") where you shimmy and squeeze between these natural rock formations about 4 feet tall. The guide said the gaps are 18"" wide. This was one of the highlights for me. I felt like a giant making my way through the grand canyon! Large people, claustrophobic people, special needs people, be warned. The final highlight of the tour for me was winding up several hundred stairs to get back to ground level and seeing the beautiful waterfall that had formed due to melting snow and ice. This was a challenging stairway hike, but doable for average people. I was in the front of the group just behind the guide- which I recommend for anyone not wanting to have the experience of running to catch up, listening to everyone's chatter or children and hearing the impromptu comments from the guide. The overall experience could have been better. The tour guide was a colorful Kentucky fellow really uptight about camera flashes (which I didn't mind). The tour experience depended on listening to his rendition of the cave's highlights. There were no signs anywhere in the cave- which could have provided more information. There were areas at the beginning of the cave that were poorly lit where people banged into each other. I felt this was a bigger safety hazard than a wayward camera flash. The tour was light on interesting history and facts, but still interesting. Improved lighting, some signage and more historical or geological facts would have made this a 4 or 5 star place, Definitely a worthwhile stop. A true bargain at $12 for a 2 hour experience.","February 7, 2014",Worthwhile Stop,77,"Phoenix, Arizona",3

They were both great, just different. Each tour is about two hours long but it goes by rather quickly. The website is a bit vague about the physical part of the tours, you have to be able to go up many stairs, and there are a few places that are tight.

We took the fairly standard tour so not too strenuous and no crawling. We were in the cave for slightly over two hours and saw a lot. We had a good feeling for how vast the cave system is and how so much more is still untrodden.I liked how our guide told us the history of the caves and we got to see how it was in the early days of using the caves as a tourist attraction when there was just candle light to see ... fairly spooky and very cool.Everything was spectacular and the stalactites, stalagmites and columns were just some of many highlights.

I have seen various cave systems around the world as a tourist to Asia, Middle East, Europe and North America; and I feel this is one of the best managed cave system as a tourist attraction.

Mammoth Cave,"I visited in mid-January, so there were very few other visitors present. Having never been to the cave before, I opted for the two-hour Historic Tour. Our ranger guide was friendly and personable, and the cave itself was obviously impressive, but I really felt that the tour was lacking in historic information. There were vague allusions to various people visiting the cave, and how it was marketed as an early 19th-century tourist experience, but I never got a coherent picture of how the cave developed into a world-famous attraction, or even how it became a national park. Furthermore, although it was clearly the off-season, and there were only about 15 people on the tour, we moved along at a rather brisk pace. Although not physically demanding by any means (it didn't seem like two miles at all), the constant movement meant that there was usually little time to stop for pictures, or even to simply take in some of the most impressive features on the tour. My suggestion- ask questions!","January 16, 2014","Nice tour, but a bit too fast",14,"Mackinaw City, Michigan",3
Mammoth Cave,"My wife and I have been to Mammoth Cave three times now and this time took the New Entrance Tour. A bus took the ten people in our tour a few miles from the Visitor's Center where we entered the cave through a steel door. Once inside, we descended down some 300 steps into the caves as our guide told us stories about the first people into the cave and how the over 400 miles of passageways were formed and have been explored. Our guide also stated he enjoys these smaller groups versus the over 100 people that often are booked for the summer tours.  For two hours we traversed various passageways and mazes, ending up in the frozen Niagara area near the end. Great tour, but you have to able to handle steps and slippery areas. At one point, the lighting system didn't work so we had to go a distance with only flashlights. That was neat, glad we didn't have a large group. I'm sure they'll fix that problem quickly.","January 9, 2014",New Entrance Excellent,65,Detroit,5

There are frequent breaks so it is not physically demanding at all. I would not recommend if you are claustrophic at all as you can start to panic when you think that there is 270 feet of rock between your head and the outdoors.

We basically saw 1/10th of a mile of a carved out mine, while the guide spent the entire time speaking of loosly related theory. To be polite, our group just looked at the guide during her presentation, rather than looking at the ""cave"" we were there to see. Going down the stairs into the cave was truly the most spectacular part of this tour. Charging money for The Mammoth Passage Tour is laughable.

Mammoth Cave,"We did both the Historic and New Entrance tours, for a total of 4 hours of exploring. These were great companion tours...the Historic tour showing the expansiveness and depth of the cave system, and the New Entrance tour showing some of the more scenic areas of the caves. Our six year old LOVED both of them. (A family on our historic tour brought a young child who DID NOT have a good time and screamed much of the trip... I encourage parents to really think twice before bringing a child younger than five.) Most of the other guests on the tour were very polite and respectful, though a couple of guests decided that it was OK to spit or do a 'farmer blow' in the cave...REALLY??? That is disgusting. That being said, the tours are definitely worthwhile. The prices are extremely reasonable for a family activity. The fact that the temperature is a constant low-mid 50s, I suggest going in winter...skip the massive summer crowds and really be able to enjoy the caves.

The Historic Tour has more of the huge passage ways that give the cave its name. There are very narrow areas, which are aptly called Fat Man's Misery and a place where they turn out all the lights for a moment. That is always fun.The New Entrance Tour is very different. It has more cave geologic features and photo ops that are lit nicely to get those pictures. We felt like we picked the right tours to get the most out of what Mammoth Cave offers in a one day visit.

We walked the extra 50 steps down on our tour to check out the eerie orange reflection off the stalagmites in the one section. It was like looking down into the depths of hell (minus the demons).

We arrived at 9:00 in plenty of time for the 9:15 ""Historic"" tour. This was a great introduction to the cave. This tour leads through a ""dry"" part of the cave, and includes detailed information about how the cave was formed, how it was used during the war of 1812 and the civil war, and the overall history of the cave and the surrounding environment. This cave is mind bogglingly huge. The tour includes some fairly tight areas (""fat man's misery"" and ""tall man's misery"" were two notable areas) - the areas were tight but not too tight for my claustrophobic spouse. After the historic tour, we got on the bus and went for the ""Frozen Niagara"" tour. Honestly, this was a bit of a let-down after the historic tour.

Mammoth Cave,"our first visit at Mammoth Cave National Park - we did the ""New Entrance Tour"" and got to walk through a dry cave and part of a wet cave with impressive stalactites and stalagmites. The first part of the tour is down a very steep and at times very narrow stairway, which can be an issue if you have bad knees and ankles, otherwise the tour is fairly easy. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. If you are visiting with school age children, it would be beneficial to do a little bit of research and give them some background on the place. The ranger narrative was not as extensive or kid friendly as I have seen in other places.","December 27, 2013",great experience,20,NC,4
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth cave is a fabulous place to visit if you like 'exploring'. The facilities there are up to mark. There are rangers and tour guides who assist the visitors at all times. Mammoth cave is the largest natural cave in USA, and still continues to expand each year. It can get really cool inside the cave, as it's underground. hence, adequate clothing is a must. Also, a must-see feature in the cave is the 'Frozen Niagara Falls'.","December 24, 2013",Very memorable experience in the largest cave,8,"Mumbai, India",5

Mammoth Cave,"This year we were fortunate enough to get the last 2 places on the River Styx tour, right to river level. Well worth the tour price, with knowledgeable guides as always.

Also explored some of the surrounding countryside this year, including the Green River ferry. Very relaxing.","December 23, 2013",Astounding!,71,"Irthlingborough, United Kingdom",5
Mammoth Cave,"We decided to go on the ""New Entrance Tour"". It was great for us. My boys (8 & 10) had no problem keeping up. Most of this tour is of a dry cave, but there is still plenty to see. At the end of the tour you will experience more of a wet cave. That's where we saw a bat and some spiders...the boys liked that! We were only at the park enough time for the cave tour, but I would've liked to explore the park more!","December 22, 2013",First cave experience,39,"Plymouth, Wisconsin",5
Mammoth Cave,"We took the Historical Tour, which was a great 2 hour tour introducing the cave and the history behind what happen ended in the cave in the past. Geological info was briefly mentioned, but the emphasis was on exploration of the cave, native people's who used the cave, and historical uses of the cave. It was a great trip for our family, including 4 children (the youngest is 5).","December 13, 2013",Very interesting,11,Alabama,5
Mammoth Cave,"We went in the end of October, so it was a little cold, but it was nice. We did lots of hikes outside and one tour inside the cave that lasted about 2-3 hours.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave is a National Park. The cave is huge!, But it has been continually destroyed by humans since discovery. The native Americans did an awesome job of destroying and littering the cave, and further destruction was caused by Americans in their search for black powder.There is a lot of history in and surrounding the cave, but most visitors will never get to see the newly discovered areas. Those areas where formations exist are fenced off. I am not kidding. There is no flash photography allowed. But who really wants to photograph cave formations through a fence? In my mind, it was as if the National Park service went out of their way to create the ugliest cave experience possible.There are continual efforts at finding/mapping new areas of the cave system, and it would be neat to be on those tours, but they are limited. Some look like true spelunking tours and might be fun, but don't expect the cave to be magical in its beauty on the History Tour or the New Entrance Tour. Beauty lies far below the areas discovered by the natives and early settlers. Perhaps someday the National Park Service will open those areas without their current propensity for fencing off the formations. Time will tell.If you want to appreciate the tremendous beauty of a pristine ""Living Cave"" environment visit Cub Run Cave in Cub Run Kentucky. Warning: Visit Mammoth Cave before Cub Run - otherwise when you see Mammoth Cave second you will be disgusted by what you see there and you will be angry with the way the National Park Service and its earliest explorers have destroyed the cave.","December 3, 2013","Typical Cave, Ruined By Humans",1,"Osceola, Indiana",3
Mammoth Cave,"The Mammoth Passage tour piqued our interest, and was so easy even for our 5 year old we took a chance on the the New Entrance tour. It takes two hours and is labeled as moderately strenuous. While it was more active , it was far more exciting for all four of us. First travelers climb down hundreds of winding steps deep into the cave. We felt quite safe as most of the tour had sturdy, well maintained hand rails. We walked through narrow passageways and saw beautiful rock formations toward the end of the tour. We plan to return when the kids are old enough to do one of the more advanced caving tours.","November 30, 2013",Great caving for famies,76,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",5
Mammoth Cave,"We took the historic tour - 2 hours of walking, sometimes through narrow, short passages. It was a great tour, even though I lost a contact lens about 45 minutes in, so I saw most of it with one eye. Many different rooms and formations. Not much in the way of color, but very interesting none the less. Our guide was very informative and I made sure to stay near him as I am hard of hearing. Out group was not huge, but large enough that I think I would have had trouble hearing him from the back of the pack.Definitely take a sweatshirt or light jacket with you, it is cool even in the middle of summer. A fair number of stairs at the end, but they really aren't a problem.Easy to get to right off the highway, I would definitely recommend this adventure.","November 30, 2013",Fun tour,20,"Saline, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"We have been meaning to visit for sometime - arriving at 10-30 we decided to take the ""New Entrance Tour"" - whilst waiting for the next one - my wife decided that the 500 steps (stairs) might just be to much for her, so we swapped to the less strenuous ""Frozen Niagara Tour"". We filled in our wait by attending a talk by ranger 'Joe', entitled ""Mammoth Cave during the Civil War"" - there were several other talks. At around 1-00, ranger ""Steve"" walked us to the bus that delivers you the short distance to the cave entrance, describing it as an easy walk to ""the most fascinating cave system on earth"". If you had seen the film and walked around the visitors centre exhibition - its likely you may have agreed with him. It might be an easy walk, but if you are claustrophobic, there is quite a narrow bit you will not enjoy.

It was a no brainer to do this visit.The park is nice, and the Visitors Center is very modern and well run.We opted for the 2 hour Historic Tour which is 2 miles of the 400+ miles of caves. Very impressive.The tour was challenging in terms of walking carefully and lots of steps and bending to not hit your head, but it was so interesting.Tour group size was a bit more than I liked, so I rated the tour a 4.

Mammoth Cave,"The basic tour of Mammoth Cave was $5/person for 1 hour 15 minutes. This tour was pretty short (didn't last the whole time allotted), and they basically take you a short distance down in the cave and then right back out. The most problematic thing about the tours is the large number of people on each tour with only 1 ranger. If you don't stick close to the front, you won't hear anything. Even though there wasn't a large group with us, the tour was pretty basic and short - thought we would get a lot more out of it. Mammoth Cave is unique because of the size, but most of the features are pretty plain compared to other rock features found at places like Carlsbad. Going on the historic tour is double the price ($12/person), and some of the groups we saw had >50+ people on them. I don't really see how you could get a lot of of a tour with that large of a group. There are some neat trails around the park, and the Visitor Center is nice.","November 17, 2013",Other caves and tours have more to offer,49,Arkansas,3

In addition to being less than a mile from the campsite, the cave itself was a great experience to see how nature and time work together.

We were in a group of about 30 with two guides. Very entertaining and knowledgable. The stairs down into the cave were as many and as steep as promised on the website, but also quite beautiful. I have a moderate to severe fear of heights (on a scale of none to paralyzing, lol) and I felt very comfortable on them. My kids had no problem with the hike at all. The way out of the cave was more gradual. The cave itself is just so cool. Even my teenager loved it.

We took two cave tours Historic and New Entry. Together they gave a well rounded view of the cave system. We are not young people (60's) but were able to keep up on both tours which are each rated moderate. We were in ""fast"" groups both times. One thing though, we would not recommend the New Entry tour for small children. Lots of stairs in tight places. Talk to the rangers before bringing little ones on this tour.The Historic tour showcases some big rooms and wide walkways on one end of the cave system. The New Entry is at the opposite end You go on a bus to the site. This is the decorated area of the cave which is also more narrow . If we were to come back, we would definitely take the Violet City Lantern Tour. This is a park that the National Park Service can be proud of.","November 4, 2013",It is Mammoth,11,,5

He was very informative in a humorous way. This tour is small, about 40 people which was nice. To us it was not strenuous but ranger Joe made sure everyone understood what to expect before leaving so you could back out if you thought you could not handle it. The tour was interesting even though you could not see a whole lot. The 12 or so lanterns could light only so much. The next day we did the Historic Tour which covered some of the same parts of the Lantern Tour and we saw all kinds of things we missed the day before due to the darkness. There were some smaller children on the Lantern tour and they did fine!We would have loved to do the River Sticks tour but is was sold out.

The New Entrance Tour was much bigger (100+ people) and thus went much slower; my son got a bit frustrated with all the stopping and slow pace of walking. But the tour itself was great, with lots of interesting historical facts and some tidbits on geology. We both enjoyed the River Styx tour more; they max this tour at 40 people and a lot of focus on the geology. Seeing and walking over the Bottomless Pit was pretty cool, as well as seeing the small rivers and Dead Sea. On both tours, the National Park Ranger guides were entertaining and full of knowledge about the caves.","October 29, 2013",Awesome cave!,23,"Indianapolis, IN",5
Mammoth Cave,"This place is fantastic! This was our kids' first road trip and it was so fun. There are a bunch of tours available, at least one for every age and ability. We did the Historic tour (2 mi and 2 hr) and thankfully booked in advance. Even in late October the 10 am tour was sold out by the time we arrived. However, it seemed the later tours were far less crowded if you wanted a smaller group. It was 27 degrees that morning but a balmy 54 degrees in the cave, as always. The next day we did the New Entrance tour (2hrs but 3/4 mi, mostly up and down 500 stairs). This tour had formations to see and was great. My daughter got to see cave crickets and a pack rat nest and was thrilled. Not to worry though, they are easy to miss unless you are purposefully looking for them. The tour guides were interesting and knowledgeable cave enthusiasts, which made it more exciting. We also hiked the above ground trails. The River Styx Spring trail was great, as was the Green River Bluff trail-switchbacks and rocky footing. The heritage trail was accessible and relatively short for those who want a shorter hike. There were some nice overlooks and we were excited to see deer and wild turkeys. I also recommend the Junior Ranger program if you have kids 4-12. The highlight of the trip for my 7yr old daughter was earning that badge.","October 28, 2013",Fantastic place for all ages,65,Libertyville,5
Mammoth Cave,"We have been to several of the National Park Caves; we went on the River Styx tour. With this being said, if you want to see a decorated cave...this is not the tour for you. The last cave we were at was the Lehman caves at Great Basin, NV - this small cave was extremely decorated. The area we were in at Mammoth was completely opposite - huge and non-decorated...a much different experience.Sue was our ranger; this was a geology tour. If you are looking for history - do the historic tour (you won't see the River Styx, but I believe the remaining route is the same). The good thing about the River Styx tour? It was limited at 40 people! The historic has well over 100. Sue did a terrific job!I did not feel any portion of this tour was extremely strenuous; you do need to be able to climb some stairs. In a few areas, you need to duck or perhaps hold onto the rails...but nothing too bad at all. There was one point on the tour (about half way) that there were benches set up to sit and rest. I enjoyed the historic entrance...nothing compared to the natural entrance at Carlsbad, but it was neat. The visitor center was nice and informative. Use the bathrooms here before going on the tour; there are no bathrooms once leaving the shelter. Make your reservations in advance, our tour was sold out. Finally, we did hike the 1/4-1/2 mile to see the River Styx on the surface once the tour was done.Just read the descriptions on all the tours and best match what you want to see. If you enjoy geology, this one is for you. Want decorations? Other side of the cave. Want history? Historic tour...

Mammoth Cave,"This cave is awesome. If you are anywhere in the area, don’t miss it. We only had time for one tour. Since this was our first visit, we decided on the historic tour, and were happy with this selection. Other people we met said the Lantern tour was also very good. Be sure to wear a jacket and gloves if you have them. We were there on a Saturday in October. The 3:00 tour was only about half full. The summer tours are always booked up, so we picked a good time to go.

There are exhibits to look at that discuss the formation of the cave, size, zoology, geology, etc. the staff that I dealt with were all very helpful. There are many tours that are available to take. Check the website for pricing, times, and descriptions. Our guide was very knowledgeable and humorous. Listen to the guides instructions. Our group was warned in advance about tight (claustrophobic) conditions, length, exertion involved in the tour. One member of our group had to be taken out of the cave because of claustrophobia. Luckily the rest of the tour was not affected. The tours have varying degrees of difficulty. The caves are dimly lit and somewhat difficult to photograph. Flash photography is not permitted in the caves.The historic tour does not have stalactites or stalagmites. If you want to see those you need to take a different tour such as the frozen Niagara tour. This being said, there were many other interesting points during this two mile, two hour romp through the cave.","October 27, 2013",Historic Tour,78,,4

Have visited some other caves over the yrs but have always wanted to see Mammoth Cave.I am on a road trip across the country so put this on the itinerary even though it was out of the way. I took the New Entrance tour because it was supposed to show the beautiful parts of the cave. The tour was informative but I kept waiting for the features common to most caves ie stalactites, stalagmites, drapery, popcorn, box work. Finally at the end we got to the beautiful part. The Frozen Niagara was awesome but a steel staircase runs in front of it so you can't get a good picture. Also along the end of the tour was a short section with many interesting features that had wire in front (to protect them). But you would hold up the tour if you stopped to enjoy or photograph them. The popular tours are huge with up to 120 people. If I had to do it over, I would skip this cave and go to Chattanooga to see Ruby Falls instead.

There are no words to describe in just a couple of lines the beauty you see inside…. Mother Nature is so special! And even though we hoped for a real speleological visit, and we finished by having a more commercial one, we did not regret it at all! Everywhere you look, there is something that makes you stare, in owe… We loved the experience so much (including our 10 years old who at first could not understand why we’ve made a trip so long just to see some rocks!!!), that we will definitely return to spend at least another couple of days around. For kids from 8 to 12, there are some special treats, such as the “Trog Tour”, where the parents are NOT allowed, or the Junior Ranger Program, both teaching children about what nature does for us and how we have to respect it and work with it.

Last night we camped out in the backcountry (which is free with a permit and you can take your dog) so that we could go on the Violet City tour, which is now by far my favorite.

Mammoth Cave,"We took two tours: the Frozen Niagara and the River Styx. The Frozen Niagara tour is fairly easy walking. You get to see some of the more decorated areas of the caves. They are not as decorated as some other caves around the United States, so this is a nice tour if you are wanting to see stalactites and stalagmites. Then we took the River Styx tour. This takes you down almost to the bottom of the cave to the River Styx. We chose this tour because it encompassed parts of many other tours and thought it gave the best bang for the buck. While you get to see a lot, there is little emphasis on anything other than cave formations. We thought since it followed the historic tour path, they would give more history, but it gives no history. Instead of this tour, I wish we had taken the Historic Tour.

Mammoth Cave,"Having toured a variety of ""commercial"" caves around the world we were anxious to see what made this place special enough to be a national park. Well, it is really really big - some would say humongous! At the ""old"" entrance it is so big you could drive a pair of semi-trailers down it side-by-side. As you get deeper there are many smaller passages and levels to explore. We saw about 2.5 miles worth on the River Styx tour - a tiny percentage of the 400+ miles of passages that have been explored so far. Our park ranger guides were exceptionally knowledgable and entertaining - just the right mix of history, geology and folklore. If you like caves this is one not to miss!Some things to keep in mind if you are considering a cave tour: Read and heed the descriptions of the tours as to their distance and number of stairs. Remember it is fairly easy going down but the climb back up can be sometimes arduous. The cave is generally dry, but it is also cool - until you start climbing lots of stairs. Only a few areas have stalactites and stalagmites, so if that is what you want to see, read the tour descriptions carefully. Compared to ""commercial"" caves the lighting is generally only white light, and it is fairly dim. Many places you won't be able to see your feet.We had the final tour the morning of the federal government shutdown so we didn't get the chance to see more of the park's offerings.","October 15, 2013",Yes it's . . . . .

Mammoth Cave,"Loved the park. We went hiking in the morning, then we took a cave tour in the afternoon. It was overwhelming, even though we only saw a small part of the caves.

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave National Park has both aboveground and cave-oriented attractions. I went here specifically for a cave tour, so I can’t say much about the roadways/trails throughout the forested park (very nice at first glance, however). Signage from I-65 to the park entrance is very easy to follow.When considering a cave tour, my #1 recommendation would be to talk to the rangers at the visitor counter. They are very informative. Discuss with them how long (time AND mileage) you are wanting to walk, how strenuous of a trip you want to take, and what you are interested in seeing. Some tours have many steps to descend. Some tours highlight noteworthy rooms; others focus on rock formations. The caves are mostly dry, but there is a river at the deepest level (featured in the River Styx tour).After you purchase a ticket, the ranger will address the group to ascertain who has been to other caves during the past several years. Those who have, and are wearing the same shoes, will have to disinfect them before entering the caves. This is to guard against spores related to a disease that is killing off bats. No matter what, you’ll do this at the end of your tour as well. Depending on which tour you select, there may be a short bus ride from the visitor center to the corresponding entrance. I chose the New Entrance Tour, which I thought was great for a first visit.The ranger guides are very informative: lots of interesting history about how the caves were discovered, explored and marketed to the public. Note that the caves in this park are generally “dry,” so there is not as much in the way of water or rock formations compared to what you might see in other cave destinations. Still, it’s fun being down there and walking through the tight passageways (watch your head), over the bridges, into and out of the big rooms, and listening to the lecture info. There are also insects that live in the caves (no harm; don’t be scared). The underground temperature is a constant 54°F, but it doesn’t feel as cold as one would expect. I would recommend bringing a light jacket or sweater, one which you can tie around your waist if you get heated up from the more strenuous passages.","October 6, 2013",My first visit; enjoyed the New Entrance (general cave) tour,598,"Tustin, California",4
Mammoth Cave,Visited Mammoth Cave as part of a horse trip to Kentucky October 2013. Took the extended frozen Niagra tour. It was a great introductory tour. They say caves are always about 54 degrees. I brought warm clothing and was sooo hot. You do not need to dress that warm as you are walking and getting exercise on the tour. Wear a pair of jeans and a shirt-short or long sleeved and that will be plenty. You are not allowed to bring any back packs with you so leave those things in the car/hotel. Found the rangers to be very helpful and knowledgeable. Would recommend this and we were lucky enough to get our tour in the day prior to the government shutdown.,"October 5, 2013",worth the stop,30,"Chicago, Illinois",4
Mammoth Cave,"I've been going to mammoth cave since I was a kid. From the school group tours through the cave to hiking with a girl scout troup, and most recently canoeing on the green river that runs through the park. Something for everyone here. Hope to return for camping very soon.","October 3, 2013",Love this place,40,"Bowling Green, Kentucky",5
Mammoth Cave,We did the River Styx Tour which was a 2.5 hr tour to the river level of the cave. Our guide was very knowledgeable about the cave and its history and had a great voice which echoed in the cave and made it easy to hear. It was a good pace and we saw a lot of the cave. The only disappointing part was that I was expecting to see more of the river than we did. I think that was only because the water level was down. We can't wait to go back and do some more of the other tours.,"October 3, 2013",River Styx Tour,23,"Tulsa, Oklahoma",5
Mammoth Cave,"Really a fantastic place to check out - the gal we spoke with at the ticket counter was very helpful in assisting us with selecting a tour that my mother and I could do (she's older and both of us have some pulmonary issues that make the more strenuous things challenging) - the tour we took was really fantastic and the two guides with our group were both informative and very down to earth (Chris & Joel, you guys made it a blast, thank you!) There is also a pretty surprisingly extensive museum that you can check out if you have a bit of time to kill before (or after) your tour(s).

Mammoth Cave,"Took two tours in September. Wished to take the Niagara Falls Photo Tour, but was not available in the Fall Season. Some disappointment there. Took the GREAT ONYX TOUR. The tour guide could not of been better. He was amusing and informed us about the history of the caves. The ONLY light available were the hand held lanterns that they passed to every eighth person who entered the cave. This is a rarely explored cave and isn't as awe inspiring in views as ones I have seen in the past...but it was good fun. We also took the New Entrance Tour where there were tons of steps and wet in spots...but people of all ages seemed to keep up. There were some tight squeezes, any ducking for most, but not crawling or getting dirty. Overall Mammoth Caves is very professionally run, extremely clean and great for the family.","September 28, 2013",Mammoth Cave Tours,8,"Warren, Michigan",4

Mammoth Cave,"We were visiting Nashville and decided to make the 90 mile drive up 65 to see the Mammoth Cave.  Be sure to check the tour schedule online before going.  You cannot just wonder in by yourself. It is actually closed off unless you are with a guide.  This cave is 400 miles long.  There are several different tours.  We did the 2 hours, 2 miles historic tour.  It was long but packed with some stories about the cave and how it was discovered and what they used it for.  It was a relatively easy tour.  There were something like 400 stairs and one part , Fat Man’s Misery, was tight, winding and slippery from the waist down.  It is pretty dimly lit.  You cannot take flash photography.  It was chilly down there, 54 degrees.  That is a constant temp, even in the winter.  It was neat to see and learn about the cave.  We thought about doing a second tour but the one was more than enough. By the end we were ready to go.  There are a couple of small gift shops with some neat books and magnets for souvenirs.  There are also 2 restaurants on site.  We ate at the more casual café.  It was actually pretty good and really inexpensive.  Don’t drink too much before your tour.  There are no bathrooms in the cave.  If you are in the area or close by I would recommend that you stop in for a few hours.  It is quiet the site to see.  And the drive from Nashville is not bad for day trip. It is about 1 hour and 20 minutes each way. ","September 27, 2013",Huge cave with lots of history,133,"Orlando, Florida",4
Mammoth Cave,A little piece of history a great piece of nature. We had Cory as our guide and he was fantastic. You can tell he has been doing this a long time. He is also friendly and funny and kept us moving right along. We did the Historic Tour. If you're not into stairs and cramped spaces you may want to talk to them before you book a tour to make sure you get on the best one for you. It's also very chilly - in the 50s.

Mammoth Cave,"We went Spelunking that's a super cool way to say went on a cave tour. On a road trip with friends we went to Mammoth Caves and took the Historic Tour. A 2 hour caving adventure. Because we were a bit off season right after the Labor Day holiday, there was a smaller group making for a great tour. The tour is considered moderate and is, we had to shimmy thru some tight spots, climb stairs, and bend down low. We had so much fun. Sadly saw no bats well, maybe not sadly. Not sure how we felt about that! great time, looking forward to our next adventure....oh and we are all in our 50's you can do it too!","September 18, 2013",We are Spelunkers!,23,"Livonia, Michigan",4

Mammoth Cave,"I went to Mammoth Cave for the first time over Labor Day Weekend. My friend and I are all about the National Park Passport Program and have started taking trips across the country to fill up the passport. This place was insane; in a great way.We went on two of the various tours at the suggestion of a park ranger, the Historic Tour and New Entrance Tour. Historic Tour takes you in through the main cave entrance into this huge room. Impressive. You continue on for over a mile (which doesn't include the walking or stairs to get to the entrance), going through some pretty tight, small spaces, including one section called ""fat man's misery,"" so be prepared. Look up while you walk and you'll see names of people along with dates they visited. It makes you wonder how someone in 1850 got so far into the cave. Have fun with the scary spiral staircase on the way out!New Entrance Tour requires getting on a bus and driving through the park for a few minutes. Before going in, the park ranger warned us that if we were scared of dark, tight, and high places that the next 10 minutes were going to be the worst 10 minutes of our lives. He wasn't lying! However, it's totally worth it when you get to the Drapery Room. Much less walking than the Historic Tour (under a mile).On both tours they turned out the lights in the cave and we sat in darkness for a couple minutes. Amazing! It was SO hard to take pictures in this place, which is okay because they wouldn't do it justice. Coolest. Place. Ever.","September 17, 2013",One of the coolest places I've ever been,2,"Orlando, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"I have been to Mammoth Cave three times over the past several years. The last time I took a large group of middle school students for a tour. They truly enjoyed the experience and it's hard to impress students this age. I always enjoy going through the cave. I see something different every time. Be sure to take a jacket since the temperature is in the 50's underground. Do look over the National Park Service brochure for the various tours. Some are harder than others to walk if you are not in decent physical shape. Also, if you have claustrophobia, this may not be the trip for you, although there aren't really may spots that make you feel confined. It is a great way to spend a couple of hours. The park rangers are excellent and tell many interesting facts about the cave and how it was formed.","September 16, 2013",Facinating,119,,4
Mammoth Cave,"My daughter and I did a month-long, National Park Service-based road trip in August and Mammoth Cave was one of our stops. Luckily we purchased our tickets for our tour before we left home as they were sold out when we arrived at the very crowded park. The caves are amazing and we really enjoyed the opportunity to see them. Our guide was knowledgeable and easy going. I was a bit put off when the small string bag I had purchased in the gift shop to use as a ""purse"" on our travels was not allowed in the cave because it could have been considered a back pack (I did not use it that way, but it had the potential). I understand and support the need to protect our natural resources and it was readily apparent that backpacks of any kind could easily bump and thump in the tight spaces within the caves. On the other hand, enforcement of rules for the sake of enforcing them doesn't make much sense. C'est la vie (at least here in the USA). We are not sorry we stopped and did enjoy our time there.","September 16, 2013","Fascinating, crowded, lots of rules",8,,4
Mammoth Cave,"Took the ""New Entrance"" tour with my family and group of people from our church after an annual picnic and Sunday School event at Mammoth Cave. Group consisted of adults as well as small children. The tour was amazing and seeing the formations underground and the natural archway architecture inside the cave that allows the walls to sustain the stone ceiling was amazing. Our guides were very knowledgeable and The Drapery room part of the tour was amazing, and the journey down into and out of the cave was a nice trip for adults and children. Had a 12 yr old ASD child who really enjoyed the cave and did excellent with the tour, so even if your the parent of a special needs child barring physical limitations, would highly recommend as our son truly enjoyed the trip.","September 15, 2013",Awe Struck By God's Underground Creation,28,"Greensburg, Kentucky",5

Our family of six with four kids ages 10 through 2, only had time to spend the afternoon; so, I went on-line to the park website a few weeks in advance and booked the Frozen Niagara Cave tour which was short (an hour) and suitable for our young children. It wasn't perilous in any way and the walkways were clearly lit and fenced so the amateur speluncers could not get lost. Our tour guide, Autumn, was knowledgeable and pleasantly witty. A few tips: bring a sweater (although the cave wasn't too chilly); running shoes are good, Crocs worked fine; no backpacks allowed; bring a flashlight. One note for travellers - the site is on Central Time - we hadn't realized that in our travels to get there we had crossed into a new time zone - it was a great discovery since we were running late and needed to gain that hour!","September 12, 2013",Cave tour suits young children,46,"Milton, Ontario",5

It is possible to sleep in bungalows, or camping. There are a lot of biking/hiking trails, so a longer visit is worth. Caves can be visited by a guided tours only, organized by the Park itself. There are short, one hour long, and longer tours, more than two hours long. We took the Mammoth Passage tour due to time limit and the fact that we were with our small kids. It is about one hour long, and it is just an introduction to what you can experience in these caves. It is easy for walking. Bring a sweater since it is cold inside.

We were able to go through many different caves and see various formations. The caves were chilly (so bring a long sleeve shirt or zip-up) but very refreshing as it was 100+ degrees outside when I went. I recommend bringing your own sack lunch as there weren't many options in the snowball cafe. Also, there was indoor plumbing so the bathrooms were great!

Mammoth Cave,"We spent Labor Day weekend 2013 at Mammoth Cave National Park. We stayed in the Woodland Cottages. Despite other reviews to the contrary, the cottages were very clean, quite large and perfectly located. They are walking distance to the visitors center and the picnic area. Firepits and grills are easily accessible in the picnic area. Bring a wagon if you have room to trasnport food items from the cottages to the picnic area which is about 100 yards away. I'd also recommend bringing a box fan to augment the ceiling fan. It was in the 90's when we were there and the fans helped cool things down.Tours - We did two tours which we reserved in advance (highly recomend reserving in advance as they sell out quickly). We did the Star Chamber tour which is an evening tour by lantern which gives you an idea of what tours were like in the 1800's. The guide, Kath, was fantastic, a great story teller and really helped everyone enjoy themselves. The second tour we did was the Historic Tour which takes you through the main parts of the cave including Fat Man's Misery and Tall Man's Misery. The kids loved this tour and it was not too strenuous. The trails in the park were well marked and well kept. The kids (age 7-12) were able to go off by themselves and explore with no problem. Wildlife included wild turkeys, fox, and deer in the picnic areas and even by the cottages.Unfortunately a lot of people in the cottages bring their dogs who immediately started barking every time a deer or other animal would approach the cottage area. That was disappointing.","September 3, 2013",Mammoth Cave Tours and Woodland Cottages,29,"Chicago, IL",5
Mammoth Cave,"We loved Mammoth Cave. The park is small and other than cave tours, those who aren't all that ""outdoorsy"" may not find much to do, but it's beautiful and the cave tours are worth the visit even if you do nothing else. We did the Historic Tour. I was a little worried because I'm a more-than-chunky guy at 5'7"" and 230 pounds (38"" waist), but I had no trouble at all fitting through the tight parts of the tour. I was a little worried about stairs since I'm out of shape, but even there, it's not too taxing for most people. Unless you struggle with stairs ordinarily (knee problems, very low stamina), I would say if you can handle an ordinary pace up a few flights of stairs, you will be okay. There are 155 steps at one point (in flights of maybe 10-15 steps each flight), but the pace is fairly slow on these as there are so many people taking them at once. If you are worried about being slow there, try to get to the front of the pack and you can allow people to pass you on the way up. At the end of that climb, you enter a cavern full of benches and sit to rest for several minutes while the Ranger talks; the average person won't need the rest, but for the few who might have trouble with the stairs, I suspect that's helpful.","September 3, 2013",Mammoth Cave - Historic Tour,14,"Columbus, Indiana",4

There area about 5 easy tours and then there are more rigorous tours lasting from 3 hours to an all day caving tour. They have a free trog tour for kids only which if I had kids they would have been on it. There are surface activities as well and the ranger talks at 730 pm.

Mammoth Cave,"We took the historic tour. We purchased at the site, as I wasn't certain I would be comfortable on the tour due to a fear of heights. The young lady at the counter showed pictures of the areas where some people have troubles, which really put my fears to rest. Truly, there wasn't an area where my fear came into play. They aren't kidding when they say that those with a fear of tight spaces shouldn't visit though. The Fat Man's Misery and Tall Man's Folly areas are VERY tight. We had a great time with it though, as we aren't thin or short people. Our tour guide was entertaining, and shared history with a dry wit that we found funny. I would highly recommend a visit to the caves.

The visitor center is beautiful with large, clean bathrooms. The tour guide was very punny (a mix of groans and laughs). But was very knowledgeable. The tour lasted the full hour and we wound around a number of passages. I would say the physical ratings of the tours are pretty true. This one was rated moderate.

Around the caves, there are some small hikes/trails that were fun to explore, and some lead to some beautiful overlooks or small gravesites. The visitors center was very modern and clean. The café in the hotel nearby the visitors center sort of reminded me of something one would see in the 80's. It had a vintage vibe! Definitely visit this national park while in Kentucky!","September 1, 2013",Amazing caves. Must see when in Kentucky!,23,"Saint Louis, Missouri",5
Mammoth Cave,"We decided late Saturday (1pm) to drive 1 1/2 hours to Mammoth Caves, we ended up on the last tour of the day, a 1.25 hour trip into the cave. Easily accessible big foot, but be prepared for a steep hill down to climb many steps before entering the cave. Loved our tour guide, Ranger Jerry, who made the trip fun and educational! Great experience for a 'last minute spare of the moment trip'.The visitors center was one of the best maintained park visitor centers I've seen yet! Kudos !","August 31, 2013",Mammoth Passage Cave Tour,52,"Knoxville, Tennessee",5
Mammoth Cave,"This was out first visit to Mammoth after 40 years on the road hitting tourist sites mostly east of the Miss. What a spectacular natural wonder! We only had abut 4 hours available to visit but it was a great 4 hours-- and we barely touched the tip of the iceberg.We hail from Georgia and never heard too much about mammoth, but its an easy 1 day drive up to the park from most of Georgia. We definitely will be back to spend some quality time at Mammoth.Great facilities and beautiful countryside. We camped in our RV in nearby Cave City and had a very pleasant time.","August 31, 2013",How have we missed this treasure in our travels!,12,"LaGrange, Georgia",5

Mammoth Cave,"I first stopped at Mammoth Cave 20 years ago during a cross-country trip. I didn't have much time, so I took the shortest tour available, but it was still quite impressive. This time around, my wife and I stopped during another cross-country trip. We arrived too late for a tour, but with enough light to setup our tent at one of the many campsites. The next morning, we took the Historic Tour, which lasted two hours and was even more impressive than the shorter tour I'd taken so many years before. The cave is so massive, there are several different tours to different parts, and we could have easily spent several days exploring the National Park and taking the various tours, but alas, we had to continue on our cross-country trek. Hopefully, it won't be another 20 years before we make it back again, because there is so much more to see.","August 28, 2013",Always more to see,55,"Saint Paul, Minnesota",5

Mammoth Cave,"35 years ago we brought our children here and took the Historic Tour. 10 years later, we were back with our son and his girlfriend to take the Wild Cave Tour. This time, we visited with our 17 year old grand-daughter and took the Historic Tour and also the Intro to Caving Tour (well she and her grand-father did. I wimped out). Each time we made the trip from southern Ontario, Canada specifically to come here and each time we were not disappointed. They offer a very wide range of tours now to cater to just about everyone. We recommend this site. We can't believe how inexpensive this attraction is.","August 25, 2013",Our third trip back,62,"Cambridge, Canada",5
Mammoth Cave,"We enjoyed our trip to Mammoth Caves. If you have weak knees or heart, please consider staying above ground. There are hundreds of stairs in and out of these caves, and lots of uneven surfaces on which to walk. That being said, the tours are interesting and there is some true beauty underground. Enjoy!","August 25, 2013",Mammoth Cave,17,"Zionsville, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"This is a great place to visit...no matter who you are! The cave is expansive and beautiful. They have a variety of tours for you to choose from: from the basic ""passage tour"" you can take it you are just passing through town (I've done that one a couple times) and want to get a quick peek at the cave... to the adventure tours where you need full gear. We just took the ""New Entrance"" tour in August 2013. It's a great tour because it covers some of the features from two other tours. It gets chilly underground, so you may want to bring a sweater...even in the summer! And gym shoes because it can be damp and slick. The tours are cheap, and the guides are great. Unless you can't walk or handle the thought of being underground...I can't think of any reason not to go on a tour. There were folks of all ages on our tours and not once did anyone have a problem. You will be amazed by the sights you see.","August 24, 2013",You've GOT to see this!,9,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave is great to visit ANY time of year, but especially in the hot summer when its too hot to do anything else! Be sure to take a sweatshirt or light jacket though, because you'll get cold when you start descending down into the cool Earth. Great part of history! Take the kids, learn something!

Mammoth Cave,It was wonderful! A lot of exercise but very worth it. The tour is very fast paced. Hint: stay toward the back of the line - then you aren't trying to keep up and it gives you time to stop and take pictures while the last people on the tour are catching up. The tour guides were information and friendly. I will be taking my family here next year!,"August 20, 2013",New Entrance Tour,2,"Avoca, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"We had 21 people in our tour group which gave the guide extra time to tell us more about the cave and the formations, etc. Kat was a really excellent guide and knew alot. Wear the appropriate shoes and take a light jacket as the cave temp is around 55 degrees. If you cannot walk well or have the physical conditions they mention at the visitor's center - don't take the tour. ","August 19, 2013",Small Tour Paid Off,16,"West Chester, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"Visited Mammoth Cave with my husband and took the 2-hour historic tour. We reserved on-line about a week before we went, and from some other reviews, it sounds like it's a good thing we did. The historic tour entrance is walking distance from the visitor's center - no bus ride like some of the other tours. 2 hours sounded like a long tour, but the time passed very quickly and I was not bored in the least. Tour guide was extremely knowledgable and the cave was just fantastic. Not a whole lot of formations, but large, large rooms, and the history is very interesting. It is an amazingly big cave, though there are some sections on the tour where spaces narrow and ceiling heights come down. At 5'7"" tall, I had to duck in places, particularly some of the stairways, and the ""Fat Man's Misery"" section is curvey and narrow from about the waist down (several of us on the tour had to pass through sideways) but it's a short section and everyone in the tour group (all sizes and body types) all fit through.The tour was spoiled a bit by a screaming toddler in our group. Really think through whether your child is up for a 2 hour tour in a dim cave, please.If we get back here someday, we'll likely do one of the other tours - there were a wide range of topics and lengths, so if you don't want to do a 2-hour tour, there are plenty of other options. But I do recommend reserving in advance.","August 19, 2013","Impressive, and aptly named!",42,"Glen Burnie, Maryland",5
Mammoth Cave,"The Mammoth caves are in a National Park north of Nashville, about an hour drive on the freeway. The caves extend for 400 miles and there are lots of different tours. We did the historic tour,- 2 miles in 2 hours which was just right, time-wise. One of the tours was 6 hours long which would have been too long for us. Everyone gathers together and the Ranger tells you what to expect in the caves. The group was large,- 80-100 people, so when you got into the caves it was sometimes difficult to hear her. The caves started quite large but after a while they became much narrower, but 'Fat man's misery' wasn't as narrow as I expected. The 'dome' a 200' high tower of rock was impressive, but we have been to other caves in France (Padirac) and South Africa which were more impressive.","August 19, 2013",A huge cave network and different experience,483,"Berkshire, United Kingdom",4

Mammoth Cave,I visited Mammoth Cave on a family visit and it was a great family experience. The cave tour is certainly worth the money if you enjoy that type of thing. It was especially fun for me because I'm just the right height to make the tour enjoyable if you are really tall you may have a sore neck. If you enjoy learning and like outdoor activities Mammoth Cave is a great place just keep in mind there is a lot of walking (the tour is 2 hours) and to get out of the cave there are about 200 steps to walk back up out of the cave.,"August 15, 2013",A Fun Experience,3,"Louisville, Kentucky",4
Mammoth Cave,"We were looking for a new vacation trip and decided to do the Bourbon Tour and added the Mammoth Cave as a side attraction. The tourist center is first rate with a self-guided learning center (museum quality, very high tech use of computers and video). We chose the historic, 2-hour tour. It was reasonably priced and was conducted in a first rate manner. Be prepared, if you are not capable of walking 2 miles or are not comfortable in tight dark places, the historic tour is not for you. The cave is well lit for the tour and we got a chill in the cavern when they turned off the lights for the longest 2 minutes of my life. The tour guide does a good job describing the history of the cave. We were just amazed at the size of the fallen limestone that littered the ground off the trail. We'll go back to see the waterfall stalactites tour the next time. We had a blast walking through the skinny little caverns and low ceiling caves. And to top it off, we saw some little bats snuggled in the ceiling.","August 15, 2013",The real man cave,15,"Memphis, Tennessee",4
Mammoth Cave,"We thought we were going on vacation to a hole in the ground and the kids would be bored in the end. We were wrong!!! Mammoth Cave NP is much, much more than a cave. It's an International Biosphere Reserve, did you know that? On the surface?!? The park is beautiful!!! Driving in, we saw turkey and deer on the rolling winding hills. The Visitor Center has an impressive scientific educational display.We took 2 tours while there; several tours have been cut due to the Federal Sequestration, including the highly recommended Snowball Room tour. We were delighted on the New Entrance Tour which features a couple of big rooms, including Grand Central Station, and beautiful formations such as the Frozen Niagara. This tour is shorter in distance walked but had many steps and narrow passages, and includes a short bus ride through the park to get to the entrance. Be sure not to rush through the first segment of the tour... It is pretty. The Historic Tour begins right at the Visitor Center and you enter the cave via steps to the original sinkhole entrance. This tour is a full 2 hours of walking and you feel like you are deep within the belly of the Earth. It features many large rooms, including the Mammoth Room, and a narrow twisting passageway named Fat Man's Misery. Lots of ducking and careful walking are needed on this tour. I would not recommend it for small children as it is a lot of single-file walking through narrow and steep passages and stairs.rhere ate portions where you will not be able to carry them. Take time to explore the surface while there on the many hiking trails or by canoeing the rivers through the park... It is much more than a typical walk or canoe through the woods. Wildlife abounds all around and numerous springs feeding and forming the caves are neat to behold.","August 15, 2013",Incredible beauty abounds throughout the park...

Mammoth Cave,we enjoyed our tour. we bought tickets to the historic tour ahead of time using the online reservation system. we got our tickets for 10am on sunday. when we arrived we discovered the 9am and 10am tours were full btu the 9:30 and other times were not. the tour 2 was 2 hours long. we enjoyed it. our guide was very knowledgeable and had a friendly personality. there were over 100 people on our tour and he did a good job of managing them and answering our questions.if I could change anything it would be to have a smaller group. but in order for that to happen for everyone it would be much harder to get a tour. so I think the current situation is a good tradeoff.,"August 13, 2013",great visit,55,"San Diego, California",5
Mammoth Cave,"I visited Mammoth last week with my wife, 7 year old and family friends (who also have two small children) and all of us loved this place! It is a very well run National Park with an interesting museum in the main office that explains how the Mammoth Cave system came to be and a cute gift shop. Very nearby is a small hotel, with two places to eat (so-so) and another gift shop. BIGGEST TIP: read the official website re: what to wear, the type of tours, etc. and you may think about booking in advance. There are lots of tours to pick from but only a few leave every 30 minutes and those sell out quickly! And you cannot book a tour online the day of. We showed up around 11:30 am on a Saturday and the first available Historic Tour was at 2:45 pm. This gave us time to eat and explore the area but it still felt like a long wait. Re: the Historic Tour - it goes 2 miles into the cave and takes about 2 hours. The National Park guides were very friendly and knowledgable. Bring a jacket or hoodie as it is downright cool once inside this enourmous and grand cave. Walking is generally easy except in a few tight and low spots. You must climb several stories of steps near the end to get back to the entrance. Enjoy!","August 13, 2013",Excellent adventure for cave lovers!,41,"New Orleans, Louisiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"My younger kids were a little nervous when we entered the cave, but they soon relaxed and had fun. It was neat to see the main cavern and the graffiti room. It was a fun memory and the tour was not more than $5 per person. This was a quick rest stop for us on our way to Nashville on a family roadtrip. A perfect place to relax and walk around for a few hours before getting back in the car.","August 12, 2013",Fun experience for whole family,46,"Green Bay, Wisconsin",4

Mammoth Cave,We stopped here on our way home from our honeymoon. We did the New Entrance Cave. It was a good tour and was moderate for difficulty. There were some tight spots and steep stairs but nothing to strenuous. We would do it again with our children. I was pretty bummed about not being able to do any other tours. The ranger said because of budget cuts they had to cut a lot of tours out. They only run so many a day and the lantern tours and Intro to caving tours only have one a day. Bummer! So book early online if your interested!One negative: There was a child about 8 years old very afraid of heights and darkness. I understand introducing your kids to new things is good but it held up the whole tour and watching and listening to this kid so stressed out the whole time was not fun! Parents take your kids on an easier tour first if your worried they might be scared. Or stay to the back of the line so others can still enjoy.,"August 10, 2013",Great stop on our Honeymoon,2,"Columbus, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"We visited Mammoth Caves with our 3 sons, ages 8, 10, and 12. We took the Historic Tour, which was fascinating and fun. Beware, that when they tell you it is a long walk, it is a LONG walk. When they tell you there are small and tight areas that you will need to walk through, they are TIGHT! My family loved it and was duly impressed. My three sons also took the Trog Tour, which is for children between the ages of 8-12 and they love it too. Everyone should visit this national park.","August 9, 2013",Fascinating,6,Chicago,4
Mammoth Cave,"We only did the Historical Tour. It is 2 hours and moderate difficulty with a tight area Called Fat Man's Misery and Tall Man's agony. If you are claustrophobic, you might consider something else. I liked the 53 degree temperature and the smooth walkway, but there really isn't much to see here. It is a rocky tunnel under ground. There was not a single stalagmite or stalagmite on that tour. It was like like being in a herd of cattle, too. There are way too many people crammed on the tour. I would have given it a 3 star, but it is a really pretty park and it is the famous Mammoth Cave with over 400 miles of mapped tunnels so far.","August 9, 2013",Not the best cave experience but liked it.,13,"Aledo, Texas",4
Mammoth Cave,"My son's Boy Scout troop enjoyed a three night stay at the campground along with two cave tours. Both cave tours were 2 hours long. Enter and exited the historical entrance. This tour allowed us to step back in history while going through some interesting areas. The second tour took use the modern entrances. Lots of stairs and incredible cave formations. When visiting Mammoth Cave, don't forget the above ground areas. This park offers some great hiking trails.","August 9, 2013",Boy Scout Troop 244,59,"Portage, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"This is a great National Park. We enjoyed our visit and found the Historical Tour very interesting. There is a lot of walking and stair climbing, so we felt we had had quite a workout. Our family of 4 paid about $40 for a 1.5 hour tour through several interesting ""rooms"" and areas of the cave, with a knowledgeable park ranger sharing great pieces of history. I think he could have answered anything about caves, geology, Kentucky and local history! The only problem we had was a collection of quite rude, loud and annoying kids on the same tour with us. We tried to avoid them by moving up in the group a few times. Of course, this could happen on any tour, anywhere, but I think taking one of the smaller tours might help avoid this. I only wish the parents would correct their children. The Mammoth Caves Hotel was selling sandwiches outside the tour waiting area, I recommend avoiding these if you can. They weren't too expensive, but also not good, and the sales guy wasn't the brightest guy. The gift shop was fun, and the staff very helpful and friendly.","August 8, 2013",Great cave and park!,73,"Niceville, Florida",4
Mammoth Cave,"We loved this experience. The location is easy to get to, plenty of parking, and many tours to choose from. If you have trouble with walking or stairs DON'T GO ON ANY TOUR!If you have children make reservations well in advance for the one tour for kids. It fills up fast and the groups are small. There is only one all kids tour per day.The entrance prices are reasonable. The cave is very cool so dress accordingly.The coffee shop has good food at reasonable prices.","August 8, 2013",Great experience with lots of exercise,147,"Round Rock, Texas",5
Mammoth Cave,"We spent four days in the Mammoth Cave are doing cave tours and hiking and loved every minute! It is worth a visit if you are in the area and if you like hiking or seeing the wonders nature has to offer it is well worth planning a trip. We did the Historic tour and the New Entrance tour and both were wonderful, and very different from each other. We would like to go back when our children are older as they both want to do the Trog tour (just for kids two hour caving tour with crawling and climbing) but the are not old enough yet (they must be at lease 8). My Husband and I would love to do the intro to caving or wild cave tours if we go back without the kids. The hiking we did around the visitors center was great, nice trails and beautiful scenery. Overall lots to do and we can't wait to go back! ","August 8, 2013",Fabulous National Park!,8,"Clarksville, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"We go to Mammoth Cave whenever we can, it is an absolute treasure and just amazing that we have this resource available to explore. I've taken two tours there recently. The ""Historical Tour"" is the traditional one that is nice to do if you went when you were a kid. It is relatively easy and has a variety of different views. Last week we took the ""New Entrance Tour"" and that was just amazing. This tour is not easy, though - lots of steps, ups and downs, etc. However, if you can hike 2.5 miles without much difficulty then you can handle this tour. The tour had 3 parts - A, B and C. A was the climb down. 280 steps straight down with twists and turns and small spaces. Wear tennis shoes and even calf-high socks if you have them, as the back of my calfs were scraped from the steps down. You open-up into a large room, which starts B. B is climbing up and down and around with some beautiful sights. C is the Frozen Niagara, which is a mineral deposit that looks like a waterfall. They give you the option to take an additional 48 steps to go under the falls - DO IT. It was my favorite part of the tour and even though I was pooped by then, it was well worth it and not a lot of extra effort. Looking up at the falls - wow. They let you rest in between each stage and you're in a cool cave, anyway, so it wasn't too strenuous. And the Niagara is near the exit, you did your climbing-up in stage B. Each tour was about $12, I believe, and takes roughly 1.5-2 hours. You have guides with you. If you're vacationing anywhere near western Kentucky then Mammoth Cave is a must-do!","August 7, 2013",What a site to see!,139,"Centerville, Ohio, Usa",5
Mammoth Cave,"I've made the New Entrance tour. It is a great cave, made for tourists with stairs and stuff, the difficulty was very easy, but the view and the history is great.

Mammoth Cave,"The park is really huge, drove 5-7 miles from the highway to the visitor center, well maintained roads. We took the Historic tour, really recommend it for the 1st time visitor. Most of the part is flat and wide. The Historic tour will bring you down 4 levels and up again. Toward the end was an area called "" Fat Man Missery"" where you squeeze yourself to walk thru. It will be very challenging for a bigger person. And there is an area where the water dripping and kind of wet on some places. It is cooler inside the cave, after a while you prob won't need your sweatshirt after up and down the stairs. Terri the ranger told us that on the 1st sunday in December, they have xmas carol inside the cave with candles/lights. It will be absolutely beautiful and the sound of people singing,will feel like you are in a concert. If you have young children with you, sign them up with a free program "" The Junior ranger"". Meet a ranger on the back porch/shelter with a picnic table, turn right before the bridge to the hotel. Your children will get a free activity book. Once they complete it they will get a badge. Our kids got 4 each Mammoth Cave trading cards too. We will definately come back in the future.","August 6, 2013",Amazing cave,83,"Syracuse, New York",5

Very enjoyable.","August 6, 2013",Incredible,19,"Florence, Alabama, United States",5
Mammoth Cave,"We took a tour of the Frozen Niagara cave at 6:15 pm. This was our second time going to the cave and didn't want to repeat the New Entrance tour which was very nice for a first time visit.Let me say that Mammoth Cave has many good tours, however the Frozen Niagara tour should be saved for folks who are seriously interested in photographing the cave. We met the guide outside the visitor center and then followed him by car to the entrance of the cave.Once inside the cave, they made 2 stops explaining the features we saw and then it was 45 minutes on your own, exploring a small section of the cave.You could take as many pictures as you wished and circulate within the assigned area.Unfortunately, we are not photographers and once we saw the basics, we were done. We probably stayed a total of 15 minutes. I did manage to take one picture, but it is very difficult to get good quality pictures if you don't have the right equipment or skill to take these pictures in dim light.I would recommend for first time visitors to take the New Entrance or Historic tour. If you are looking to spend some time inside a cave without being rushed, the Frozen Niagara would still be ok to take. The only drawback is that you don't go too far and see much of the cave. It is an easy walk, a few tight spaces and low ceilings but all very manageable. One short stairway.I would have given it 4 stars for the opportunity to take pictures, but 3 stars for overall cave experience. Try the other tours first if you want a bigger exposure to the cave,","August 5, 2013",Serious photographers only,10,"Chicago, Illinois, Usa",3
Mammoth Cave,"Thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Mammoth Cave! Took 2 tours: Historical and New Entrance. Recommend both. Taking the 2 will give you a very complete look/understanding of the cave system. They are honest in their description of ""moderate"". I am 49 and in average health; I made it and was totally fine. My just turned 4 year-old completed the trek just fine as well. Did have some very obese folks as well as folks using canes on trip that did not fare well. RE: booking online, we did and while we wouldn't have had to as the park was not crowded on this day, I am glad we did to ensure we could make the tours.

Mammoth Cave,"We had really been wanting to see Mammoth Cave; and it did not disappoint. We took the Historic Tour at 3:15 which is a 2 hr. tour with about 450 steps; and 2 miles total; but wasn't as strenuous as it sounded. The Tour Guide was very informative and led a great tour. 400 miles of cave passages have been documented so far; and we would love to return and take a different tour available. Nice gift store, bathroom facilities; ample parking available at the Welcome Center. Tour guides are also outside at a desk where tour times and info. are posted and are available to answer any questions anyone would have about a particular tour; to help you decide it it's appropriate for you. There were a few tight squeezes on this tour and narrow stairs that at times were somewhat slippery; but was not as difficult as I thought it would be. No backpacks are allowed; and several people had to trek back to their vehicles and leave them 5 min. before the walk down to the cave entrance. A light jkt., camera are a must. Several people carried their own flashlights which I would do on a return visit; esp. if you get a little nervous about walking where you can't see every step your taking. About half way thru there is a sitting area after the stairs to take a break; listen to the tour guide and ask any questions you have. The Historic Tour is one of the tours recommended for first time visitors.","August 5, 2013",Really amazing Cave Tour; a must see when in KY,19,"Calhoun, Georgia",5

Near the end is the best. Very clean, well organized park. Very crowded 4th of July weekend , but crowd was absolutely no problem. Also, walked two miles to the deep hole, but that was a waste of time. Great souvenir shop at far east end of park. Spent about 4 hours doing everything we did.

We did an above ground tour, which discussed the impact of slavery on the site. Educational and enlightening. The shear beauty of this place was also astounding, I'd rank this next to Zion as one of the two most beautiful national parks I've seen. Very easy to get too, next time we plan to camp there.

When we got there the many choices of tours, their fill level, and time it took us awhile to decide what tour/tours to take. Unfortunately we were on a schedule and didn't have unlimited time. We ended up taking the Historic Tour. It was very good. The Ranger giving the tour was very knowledgeable. Lots of historical information, if not lots of cave formations. I recommend doing your homework, picking the tours you have interest in and purchasing tickets on-line. Then allow enough time to enjoy the caves and the area.","August 4, 2013","Worth the stop, wish we could have stayed longer",194,"Fritz Creek, Alaska",4

Mammoth Cave,"The worlds largest cave system in the world has captured the minds of my granddaughters. We are took the historic tour and loved the Park Rangers storytelling abilities to capture our attention. If you are between the ages of 8-12, the best tour for the children is the Trog Tour. Park rangers suit them up in coveralls, knee pads, head kerchiefs and helmets with head lights. They are taken, without parents, guardians, or grandparents on a 2 hour tour.

Mammoth Cave,This was a very enjoyable. Call ahead for reservations and take a light jacket. Everyone should visit the largest cave in the world at least once in their lives. This was return visit from 40 years ago. I was glad the big room was lited with low light electricity instead of torches. Entrance was steeper and more stairs than I remembered. Glad that bats are in the trees during th summer.Great visit.,"July 31, 2013",Great visit,22,"Birmingham, Alabama",5
Mammoth Cave,"The buildings and exhibits are nice. The on-site system works very well. However, if we had trusted the reservation line, we would not have gone because they said that all the tours that fit our abilities were sold out for 2 days. The truth is: the park reserves tickets to sell on the day of the tours in the cases we checked.Having been in other caves, we were VERY disappointed. The Ranger was interesting and fun which helped since there was very little to see. Because of my husband's walking ability, we had to choose this tour, but it was so packed with the capacity tour number AND all their children, that rather than feeling cave-ish and intriguing, it only felt crowded. We will not go back.","July 30, 2013","Very disappointed in Frozen Niagara tour, and don't trust the reservation line.",71,"Dallas, Texas",3
Mammoth Cave,"We did the Lantern City tour, and it was great! I would suggest wearing sturdy walking shoes, as there's no rails to help you support yourself on this 3 hour tour. Tour guide was very knowledgeable, and helped us learn the history of the cave in a fun way. There are also shorter, less strenuous tours available at the caves. As for the cave, it's amazing. We loved the natural beauty of the area, as well as inside. The history for this area is rich, with known use of the caves for thousands of years. ","July 30, 2013",It's awe inspiring.,44,,5

Mammoth Cave,"Spent just one day here and wished we had more time to spare. Its very reasonable ticket prices for a national park. For $12 each my huaband and I went on the new cave entrance tour which takes you down very narrow sets of stairs. Having to duck and bend to get through some spots. If your claustrophobic I wouldnt reccomed this tour. We went on a monday and it was packed, i couldn't imagine what the wekends look like. Our ranger told us the best time to come is in the winter, the tour groups are very small then. At the end of the tour is frozen niagara which is truely beautiful. I could've just spent hours photographing it, but alas the rangers move you along. The park does shuttle you by school bus to and from each cave sight.","July 29, 2013",Worth the drive to see,33,,5

Mammoth Cave,"Our family took the Focus on Frozen Niagara tour. We chose this tour since it was short in length and distance not knowing how our 9 year old daughter would like the tight spaces. Our guides was very informative and friendly. Before entering cave we were given our rules - keep kids close, don't touch rocks. We were told we might see bats. Since inside guide gave us information about each to we were in. He told us he would turn out lights so we could see how dark it would be. He also showed us cave crickets on ceiling. Between the crickets, bats and darkness, our daughter was in tears. Just not her thing which was why we chose a.shorter tour. Husband and daughter left early so she could be outside. 13 yr old son and I stayed and enjoyed cave and took picture. For our family, this was a great tour. We recommend trying a shorter and easier tour like Focus on Frozen Niagara if you are at all concerned about how any family member might do in a cave. While in park we saw lots of deer and a would turkey. ","July 29, 2013",Very interesting tour,30,,4

Mammoth Cave,"I don't know, while it was big I wasn't overly impressed. I think part of that is my own misguided idea of what I was going to see. Our guide was fantastic though, have no complaints there. We went on the Mammoth Passage Tour and despite having a National Parks Pass, had to pay (didn't have to at Carlsbad so it was odd... ). Got there about 1 hour early and the line was out the door, but managed to get a spot without reservations anyway. The tour DID fill up fast though but there were plenty of tours to go around. Perhaps doing a different tour would have left me more satisfied... ?CANNOT bring backpacks into the cave. Even small ones that are substituting for purses. Some of the other guests were obnoxious (honestly, if you can't control your kids, don't bring them and ruin the experience for others.)The gift shop in the Mammoth Cave Hotel had much nicer things than in the Visitor's Center. (There is also a penny machine in the hotel and none in the gift shop for those of you who collect them!). ","July 27, 2013","Well, it was big...",83,"New York City, New York",3
Mammoth Cave,We booked online in advance of our trip and discovered that a disclaimer regarding fear of heights re the Historical tour was NOT given until AFTER the tickets were purchased. There were some scary moments; but I overcame my fear - with the encouragement of a fellow hiker - and felt victorious when I emerged from the trek. Totally amazing to think of the intrepid explorers of yesteryear poking around underground with just torches! Very Interesting! You could spend a lot of time checking out the many tours.

Mammoth Cave,My family had a great time doing the Historical tour. We reserved our tickets as suggested from the parks webpage in advance for 9:30 am but got to the park about an hour earlier then we expected so switched out tour to the 9Am tour. Their was a small fee of $3 per ticket but since we are on a long road trip we didn't mind spending the extra money to move our time. The gentleman who gave us our tour was incredible and had extensive knowledge of the caves and the history of the people who made the caves the magical place it is today. My family had an awesome time kids ages 8 and 12 loved the tour and I wish I had given this area of our road trip more time. I wouldn't do the Historical tour if you have a problem bending over or if you are over weight because there are some tight spots you have to squeeze through.,"July 26, 2013",Great adventure the kids loved it,103,"Santa Rosa, California",5
Mammoth Cave,"We were on our way to Kentucky and decided this could be fun. My husband and I loved it as did our 7 and 9 year old. We did the historic tour which is moderate but we thought it was easy. Super cheap prices on the cave tours( $40 for 4 of us) and many trails to go discover on your own. This was the favorite thing we did for my 9 year old and we did Six Flags. Grand Ole Opry, museums and more. Only downfall...we don't live closer.","July 26, 2013",A Must!,1,,5
Mammoth Cave,"After reading previous reviews we chose the New Entrance tour for our family (kids ages 7-13). We stayed in Louiseville (which is on Eastern time zone) the night before and we had no idea that Mammoth Caves is on Central time-- so we were an hour early (so were some other people!). Although this was a little frustrating there was plenty to do with the gift shop and Visitor's center that has interesting and well-done displays and movies about the caves. We only had time for one tour and the New Entrance tour seemed to have a little bit of everything. The tour was 2 hours but that includes the guide's introduction, explanation of the tour, and loading a bus to take you 4 miles to the cave entrance (and then back when it was over). Total time in the cave is around 1 hour 15 minutes. Our group was large and there were only three times our guide talked to us as a group- the rest is spent walking. The first part of the tour is walking over 250 steps down down down (and then back up later!). The steps were very narrow, quite steep, and very fun for all of us. It is amazing to think of how difficult it must have been for those who discovered the cave, and for those who built all of those stairs in such a small, narrow, and steep space. The later part of the tour is where you see stalactite and stalagmites. The kids loved the experience. ","July 26, 2013",New Entrance Tour. ALERT: Mammoth Caves is on CENTRAL standard time!!,30,"Glenview, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"Recently visited the cave with family that had never been, and below it's just the same as when you were a kid. Nothing down there of course has changed. On top they have a beautiful new visitors center and exhibit area that tells you all about the cave system. Visit the park website for info on all there is to do. If you don't want to go below, there are some surface trails to walk. During peak tourist seasons, like summer, or weekends in summer especially, i highly recommend booking your tours of choice on line before your visit!!! They will sell out! Two of the most popular tours are the historic tour, and the new entrance tour. Also, know your limitations. For example, we took the new entrance tour and it starts off by going down many, many stairs about 250 feet. some of the areas are tight, but very manageable, unless you are clostrophobic. I mention the stairs going down because of course what goes down, must come up! We took my mother on this tour, she is about 75, a smoker, and sedentary in her daily life. She had a hard time but did make it. I am mid 40's, sedentary, and i was fine, but it honestly took me 3 days to recover. My leg muscles really got a work out. This tour is listed as moderate. I really don't like bugs and i saw one down there. Not a huge deal, but just want to mention this. we visited on a peak summer Saturday and it was packed. our first time choice of tours was already sold out when we arrived at 10am. But they have many time choices so we just booked a later one and hung around. Mom and I didn't go one the second tour after our first one so we visited the gift shops, there are 3 or 4 right near the visitors center, and we found some coffee in a small diner type restaurant right near there also. The staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful. All in all a great trip! Especially if you've never been to a world class national park Cave. Only about an hour from Nashville, and about an hour from Louisville. Not much in the area as far as restaurants and hotels. Nearby Bowling Green is a bigger city if these things are needed but it is 20 or so minutes away. Would not recommend for small children, it can be dangerous for them and hard to carry them through the cave.","July 25, 2013",Reserve tours ahead in peak times,38,Kentucky,5
Mammoth Cave,"Whether you plan ahead (recommended), plan with a very helpful ranger upon your arrival, or just wonder some of the nice trails - this park is quite enjoyable. I was short on time and walked down to the Historic Entrance. A nice walk that included informative displays along the paved trail. A small gift shop is n the visitor center but a bigger selection is in the building adjacent to the hotel.

Mammoth Cave,"On our trip from KeyWest back to Ohio we planned to stop at Mammoth Caves, being that we loved the National Parks and caves. The problem was we did not take into account that it was Memorial Day weekend. The place was PACKED!!! Almost all the tours were booked. People and small children running everywhere. We did manage the unguided tour which gave you a taste of the cave entrance area. It was amazing and we plan to go back at a better time. A park ranger said the crowds diminish October to March (and since the temperature in the cave is constant) we will make plans accordingly. As a plus the rangers were all helpful and really kept their cool with such huge crowds. Kudos to them.","July 23, 2013",Plan your visit!,14,Ohio,5

As we were travelling back home from our Smoky Mountain trip we stopped off at Mammoth Cave to give them their first exprience in a cave. We took the ""New Entrance Tour"" with rangers Kevin and Corey. The kids really took to the rangers (even took photos) and found the cave very fascinating. There is 300 stair steps to take, so it's not for those who don't like a stepping challenge, but what less could you expect in order to discover the depths below ground. The rangers were great at teaching the way the caves formed and pointing out little details as you go. There are a few places during the tour when they stop and you can catch your breathe on a seat if need be.

Mammoth Cave,"We had wanted to take the historic tour, but they won't sell tickets over the phone for the same day, and by the time we arrived it had sold out. So we took the New Entrance tour instead. I thoroughly enjoyed the tour despite a few complaints. First of all, they crammed too many people into one tour, so by the time that those in the back make it to the open auditorium section of the cave, our guide was already halfway through her speech. My wife wasn't able to fully enjoy herself because of our 7 year old daughters hyper active cave-inappropriate behavior. I really loved seeing all the rock formations. My wife had knee issues for several says after this tour due to all the stairs and uneven walking. We saw many folks older and larger than us having an even more difficult time. Overall I would do it again (a different tour though), but my wife probably would not.","July 22, 2013",Bring your walking shoes,60,"Tavares, Florida",4
Mammoth Cave,"I have been on many cave tours, and had been looking forward to taking the historic tour for several months. The tour was pretty much ruined from the get-go by screaming babies. I don't understand what would possess a parent to bring infants or toddlers into a what could be a dangerous cave area, with small passages, steep stairs and inclines, low ceilings, and then be surprised when their small children become frightened and upset. There were a hundred other people with you who paid good money to have what for most is a once in a lifetime experience, who couldn't hear anything the tour guide said over your child screaming and crying. They say many times before the tour starts that people with certain conditions should not take the tour. Having small children with you should be at the top of that list.","July 22, 2013",Screaming babies do not belong on a two hour cave tour,36,"Lucasville, Ohio",2

Mammoth Cave,"Ranger Rick was our guide for our tour, it was amazing from start to end, he knew those caves inside out, any question could be answered and he had some fascinating stories from the past. The caves are breath taking! It is cool inside of the caves, which was a welcomed break from the intense heat outside. The tours are very well organised from start to end which is perfect and to be able to say you ate lunch in a cave is pretty fun. In one part of the cave there is an opportunity to buy a lunch box, which includes a drink, sandwich, fruit and crisps and a very reasonable price. I will return again in the near future, it is a must do for any nature lover out there, the bus from the centre to the cave was beautiful also as you get to drive through some of the park, and we saw some native wildlife on our journey including deer!

Mammoth Cave,"We stopped here almost on impulse (it wasn't part of our originally scheduled trip) and took the self-guided tour since many of the others were booked up (plus my husband and son weren't crazy about walking 2 miles). It sounded like it wouldn't be too strenuous but I would point out that when you walk down to the cave opening, you have to walk back up the same way and it is a pretty sharp incline. I was fine but my husband and son were panting and had to take a few breaks on the way up (made more urgent by the fact that the cave is very cold and stepping out into the warm humid air probably made them have to ""go"" and there weren't any bathrooms except at the top). The cave is very cool on the inside and if you get cold easily you'll probably want a jacket. It also makes it feel doubly humid when you come out because your skin gets chilled and then all the moistness in the air seems to attach to you when you come out. All in all, I didn't find it spectacular but then we were only able to see a small portion. It was nothing like visiting someplace like Carlsbad Caverns.","July 20, 2013",I could have taken a miss,40,"Pflugerville, Texas",3

Mammoth Cave,After reading the descriptions of all the available tours I was disappointed to see that many of them involved 500+ steps so I had limited choice. Although I arrived early they were all booked until the afternoon so I was left with the Mammoth Passage option - what a waste of time! It only cost $5 but was a huge disappointment.

We were a little concerned that our 4 year old wouldn't manage all the steps but she did great. Our guides Richard and Kevin did an amazing job of answering all our questions and educating us and our kids about the cave system and its history. I had been to the cave when I was about 14, so to come 25 years later as an interested adult was superb. I had hyped up my husband and kids and was thrilled that the park did not disappoint.

Mammoth Cave,"We took the Historic Tour of the Mammoth Cave over the 4th July weekend. This place was right in the Mammoth Cave National Park area and an easy ride from most camping grounds. The tour itself lasted about 2 hours and we enjoyed the guide's explanation of the history. The tour was informative and fun. The enormity of the cave is its usp. The guides were great and so was the information they provided. The cave tour can be strenuous in some parts so recommend carrying water with you. These tours get booked quickly, so reserve online, ahead of your visit. They have other tours as well depending on your interest levels.Given it was a long weekend and inspite of the rains, the tour started on time and was not rushed. This place also has self-discovery tours, so you can trail the caves by yourself too. This being in the national parks area, there are beautiful trails around the caves. Refreshments are available at the Mammoth Cave Hotel which is near the visitor center (we didn't try it though). There is ample parking.Would recommend this for anyone interested in natural rocks, underground caves, and exploring new places.","July 18, 2013",Great tour & visit,9,"Dayton, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"We chose to go to Mammoth Cave because we wanted something cool to do on a hot summer day. The park is beautiful, we saw wild turkey, deer, squirrels around the park. The scenery is gorgeous. The building where you buy your tickets is very clean, restrooms clean and well stocked, plenty of park rangers around that all were very friendly. Our guide for the cave tour we went on was very knowledgeable, and provided very interesting and pertinent information about the cave as we toured. The tours are reasonably priced, our tour was 5 $ for adults, 3$ for our son and last 1 1/4 hours. Don't forget to take a light jacket, the caves are 54 degrees, also take a flashlight so you can see more of it, the caves are just dimly lit. I would not recommend the cave tours for very young children or babies. The babies that toured with us cried to entire time and our tour guide had a hard time talking over them to narrate the tour. Overall a great time!","July 18, 2013",Great way to spend a hot day.,16,"Hazard, Kentucky",5
Mammoth Cave,"Was a little overwhelmed with the various tour options on the website, and there aren't any photos to look at to help you with the decision. I picked the New Entrance tour (although looking back, we probably also would have enjoyed the Historic tour). So where can you go wrong? It's a national park with 400+ miles of cave. Yes, there is a lot of walking, yes there are some cramped spaces, but come on - its a natural wonder. What do you expect? It wasn't as bad as I thought it was gonna be. Everywhere I read or saw - where hiking shoes or sneakers. I wouldn't recommend wearing flip flops or sandals, but hard core hiking shoes aren't necessary. I wore some low Keds, and it was fine. There are paths, and there wasn't much water on the ground in the New Entrance tour. There was a lot of steps going down - and all of the hardcore steps are at the beginning of this tour. So you go down down down all at the beginning - lots of metal steps, but part of the wonder here, is how they built the steps into super narrow vertical cracks in the ground to get you down there. Now some of those spots are TIGHT squeezes. You have to turn sideways, or backwards, etc. to get down. It really is amazing though. You can look over the railing of the steps and see a hundred feet or more down. And looking up - its just astonishing how they built those steps! So once you are down, then it really isn't that bad. The first 3/4 of the cave tour does not have any formations. You are just amazed at the sheer size and openness of the cave. Our tour guide park ranger was SOOO informative and he was one of the best guides we have ever had at any cave (we have been to a dozen or more in the last few years.) At the end, you end up at the Frozen Niagara, which is the ""crown jewel"" of the cave with large flowstone formations which are really pretty. Also lots of cave popcorn and bacon, stalactites and stalagmites.The tour lasts total about 2 hours, but some of that is loading buses and getting there and back, so really I think we were in the cave about an hour and fifteen mins or so. Total there were four of us, myself, my husband and our 2 boys (ages 10 and 12). Everyone enjoyed it although my 12 year old was a little bored because there weren't as many formations as some caves we have been to. Price was extremely reasonable! Just remember no bathrooms down in the cave. And the visitor center is worthwhile too!","July 17, 2013",New Entrance tour - great tour guide!,93,"Lancaster, Pennsylvania",5

The tour guides were great, very knowledgeable. They waited until everyone gathered to speak, and were very friendly and funny. My family and I especially liked how at the beginning of the tour, the rangers went over the physical expectations in case you need to rethink the tour. There is a tour called the Niagara Tour, where they show you a room filled with stalagmites and stalactites. However this tour is included in the New Entrance Tour, so you shouldn't do both of those.

There were quite a few people on the tour and it was best to be in the front to hear what the ranger was saying. The temperature in the cave was around 54 degrees but felt good as the temperature outside was near 90! We would like to go back and stay at the hotel there and take a different tour.

We did both the Historical Tour and the New Entrance tour. Remember to bring a sweater if you get cold easily. Neither Tours were over strenuous. The New Entrance Tour had LOT of downward stairs. Even though the Historical Tour was very interesting (cool stories and candle graffiti on the ceiling), I think I could have just done the New Entrance tour and had been just fine. It had similar canyons, no graffiti, but it had the Frozen Niagara Falls which were simply amazing. There is a really nice trail that goes down to a natural spring.

The 2 hours flew by. The only caveat- if you are claustrophobic this may not be the tour for you. There are a few places where the space is tight though most of it is very open.The restaurant/coffee shop was the best we've ever found at a National Park.

The web-site is a little confusing with so many tours offered but same day tour service unavailable on-line.We had to wait until we drove up to purchase a tour and by that time tours were sold out. This cave is dark and pictures don't turn out well. Be aware that there are lots of stairs. They will tell you that you can do it, but if you are in any way disabled this is not the cave for you.","July 16, 2013",Enjoyable.,26,Texas,5

Mammoth Cave,"It was a little out of our way and we were tempted to skip it, but so glad we went. The caves are in the gorgeous mammoth cave national park, which in itself is worth the visit. We went for an easy hike through the trails in the woods. We went on a busy Saturday. Most of the tours were sold out, and I was a bit nervous about going on a long tour anyway. We opted for the short discovery tour which is a self-guided tour, meaning that we were on our own to stay longer or leave quickly if we wanted to. I was brave and got over my initial fears and enjoyed walking through the cool, damp cave with my family. Plus, it was only about $4 each.","July 15, 2013",Don't miss it,19,"Sarasota, Florida",5

Mammoth Cave,We didn't have much time...only 1 hour to visit and took the self-guided tour. It was just ok. We didn't see any cool formations only stone carved out of the cave and a few artifacts. The guide that was in the cave was very knowledgeable and friendly. I would plan to take the 2 hour tour because the pictures of it were incredible. I wish we would have had more time to take the longer tour.,"July 14, 2013",Make time for longer tour,3,"Searcy, Arkansas",4
Mammoth Cave,"Guess we were spoiled by Meramec Caverns in Missouri and their beautifully lit caves with colored lights shining on many of the cave walls and formations. The 2 hour tour was more going up and down steps than being able to look at the cave itself. Many steps narrow and damp, so you had to really watch where you were going. All the cave rooms were just that - cave rooms - brown/tan/beige - and once we were in the cave the first hour everything looked the same. I uderstand the history of the caves and how they came to be - - - but presentation was disappointing. I would not go again. They moved you through very quickly so not much time to stop and look. Many walk areas did not even have railings, which surprised me with the safety aspect. More stairs than flat surfaces. ","July 14, 2013",Disappointed,13,,3
Mammoth Cave,"We did the Historic Tour ($12 each person) which took 2 hours, 2 miles of walking and climbing about 500 steps. Many tours sell out so see the website for availability. There is a fat man's misery section that was tight and narrow plus lots of sections where my husband who is 6' tall and he had to bend down. The Ranger was very informative and gave a good tour explaining the history of the cave and answered all questions asked. This attraction and tour is very much worth it!!! A must see!!!","July 14, 2013",Amazing!!! A must do,21,"Miami, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I brought our kids here for this year's family vacation. We have a 12-year-old daughter and an 8 year-old son who is non-verbal with autism. We took the kids on the New Entrance tour and they loved it! My son giggled through the 280 step descent to the cave floor and enjoyed hiking through the rest of the cave. The stops were informative, but brief enough we didn't have to worry about him getting restless. My daughter also did the Trog tour, which we reserved weeks in advance, and had a great time crawling through the cave. We took several short hikes in other areas of the park the kids enjoyed too. The rangers here are incredible and really make the experience. We had dinner one night at the hotel restaurant. The food was obviously homemade and the gracious server didn't bat an eye at my son's behavior. It was Sunday of July 4th weekend, but we were still in and out in under an hour. Highly recommend it.","July 14, 2013",Nice family vacation!,46,"Detroit, Michigan",5

Mammoth Cave,"When the unlimited hydroplane races at Madison, IN were cancelled, I was already miles from home with nothing to do. So I pulled out my trusty Rand McNally to see what was between my hotel in Lake City, TN and Madison - Mammoth Cave. Even though I'd been there before, it had been over 30 years ago, and I remembered little of my visit. So, I did something I rarely do - I went to an attraction for a second time. Glad I did - I got the last spot on the two hour guided tour of the New Entrance, and it was entertaining and educational. The National Park Service ranger was, as usual for this bunch, excellent, providing us with fun facts and figures throughout the tour. Hard to beat for $12. If you do go - make reservations! I went on the Fourth of July weekend and the place was packed! A ranger told me that they'll get 3 or 4,000 people through a day on holiday weekends.","July 12, 2013",Fun on a rainy day,70,"Tampa, Florida",4

Mammoth Cave,"We visited in summer of 2012 with our 3 boys (ages 9,6 and almost 2 year old) I used a moby wrap to carry my son because you can't take strollers in the caves and he wasn't going to walk all that way. I can't remember which tour we went on but it was very cool and we all loved the experience. Some of the areas of the cave were a tight fit and I'm not a large person. I wear a size 10-12 pants and had to walk sideways through a few places cause otherwise you get stuck :) its a long walk so I recommend that only healthy active people do these. We had an older couple in our group and while they seemed to do fine I felt so bad for them because I'm not sure if it was more than they expected it to be physically. I know I was beat after all that walking and carrying of my son but it was worth the experience. Would definitely do it again. ","July 11, 2013",Very awesome,14,,5
Mammoth Cave,"Took wife + 9 kids (teens to 8 month old). We all took the historic tour and did the walk and stairs. Wife even nursed along the way. The cave is mammoth! The historic tour allows you to see classic mammoth cave. You see very interesting features and get a good bit of history. We made online reservations the night before. Lots of people there for all the tours. A bit crowded but that may have been due to summer time visitors...I don't know.I forget the guide's name but he did a really good job. A lot of people had sweaters, but the cave temp was just fine. They say it is 58 deg, but it really did not feel like it. You feel a cool blast when you first enter the cave, but after that that, not really. We are from Texas so we might be more vulnerable to being cold, but none of the family was.one of the concerns with the tour since it allows up to 120 ppl, is that would not hear the guide if we were in the back. However, people would gather around in bigger areas and then the guide would speak. Everyone was able to hear the talk.","July 10, 2013",historic tour was great,35,"San Antonio, Texas",5
Mammoth Cave,Love going to the cave. My wife is from the area near the cave. Since I met her we have been to the park several time and taken several differnt tours. I have never been disappointed.

I can't wait to go again.,"July 10, 2013",Amazing,3,"Muscle Shoals, Alabama",5
Mammoth Cave,We did the evening tour of the cave. It was interesting. The Park Ranger was very knowledgeable. This was our first time visiting this park.

All in all a very good adventure.,"July 10, 2013",Wonderful Park,12,North Georgia,5
Mammoth Cave,"As always with the national parks, Mammoth Cave was great! My daughter participated in a 2 hour tour for kids only (Trogs) and loved it! All equipment was provided including jump suits, knee pads, and helmets. The guide was very nice according to my daughter. We had time for a quick hike while we waited for her. Next morning, the 3 of us went on another cave tour, the quickest and easiest they have because we did not have enough time for a long one but it was great. You can make reservations ahead of time for the cave tours on the National Parks web site, I highly recommended it. MY daughter also was able to get a badge of the park by completing an activity book while we waited for her tour.

Mammoth Cave,"We really wanted to do the Focus on Frozen Niagara tour, as I wanted to photograph the cave. That tour ended up being sold out, so we had to book the Historic cave tour. It was a great tour! I still got quite a few great pictures, however, the guides come along and tell you to hurry along, because they have other groups coming in. Take notice of the warnings that they give at the beginning of the tours. There are several tight areas, and you will be climbing stairs at points. If you are able-bodied, by all means, do this tour! It was awesome!! I can't wait to go back and hopefully take the Focus on Frozen Niagara tour. Just breath-taking!PS - Make sure to stop by the restroom in the visitor's center. There are no restrooms in/around the cave and it's a two hour journey. Also, bring a jacket! It's about 50 degrees inside... you'll be chilly at first, but after awhile, you'll probably be removing your jacket.","July 8, 2013",Excellent tour - make reservations!,51,"Redford, MI",5
Mammoth Cave,"We went on a tour of the mammoth cave and really enjoyed it. The rangers are excellent tour guides. It is well worth the price of the tour. They offer many different tours during the day and reservations are a good idea. Some tours are offered infrequently and fill up days ahead of time. Look at their online web site to choose your tour and make the reservation. They explain how many steps and involved in each tour. If you are not that physically fit, pick the tour that has about 15 steps. Even those steps are optional. The regular tour has many more steps. One tour is a first step in learning to explore caves. Those people crawl through small areas with jump suites and head lamps. There is a tour for every skill level.","July 8, 2013",Great Park,7,"Urbandale, Iowa",5

Mammoth Cave,"The historic tour is 2 hours in length and very interesting. A couple of parts are a bit more challenging (tight spaces, low clearances, quite a few stairs) but not at all difficult if you're in semi-decent shape. The cave is unusual as it is a dry cave, meaning no formations of stalactites and stalagmites to see...mostly what is amazing are the spaces and nooks and crannies. My complaint is that the tour felt very rushed. We were constantly being reminded to stay together as a group and not lag behind, so getting pictures became difficult at best. Even with the reminders, there were more than 100 folks on our tour, so some of the 2 hours was spent waiting for everyone to gather at the next stopping point. It is too bad that they feel the need to rush people along because the cave is beautiful and I would have enjoyed the tour more had I had the opportunity to stop and take it all in instead of hurrying to keep up.","July 8, 2013",historic tour great but rushed,110,houston,3
Mammoth Cave,"We signed up for two tours in one day, since the others offered were already filled. Due to sequestration, several tours were cancelled (ie. lantern tours in the evening) so make a reservation to get the tour that you want. Read the descriptions for number of stairs, amount of travertine formations on the tour (versus long, dry caves that are dimly lit). Our tours had over 100 adults and children in the group -- a bit too many. National Park rangers were very helpful and knowledgeable.

Take the precautions seriously. There is a ""fat man's misery"" section that was difficult, plus lots of sections where a man of my height had to stoop. Narrow, damp footing (wear sensible shoes). The Rangers gave a good tour explaining the history of the cave. ~Two miles of walking, and about 500 steps to climb. One stretch was over a long drop off.

He was informative, funny, was great at controlling the over large group and above all, had the patience of a saint. Very beautiful areas of stalactites, stalagmites and columns My only complaint is that the group was too big. Broken into half would have much better - but this didn't affect me too much, just think it would make it better. Afterwards we went to mouth of historic tour cave and then did a great hike down to the green river - which was overflowing and brown due to lots of rain, and then along the bluff - coming out at back of visitor centre car park. Think this must be a great park to come to with the kids and stay for a few days. They do various walks and have evening events as well.

Mammoth Cave,"We travelled to Bowling Green this summer and decided to make a stop at Mammoth Cave National Park. I was unaccustomed to a national park being so tour oriented, but that's practically the only way to see this park. The focus is a cave system that has a network of over 400 miles of caverns below ground. There are none that you can see without taking a scheduled tour. Topside, the visitor's center has a really nice museum to pass time while you wait or even if you opt out of a tour, which we did. If you don't go on a tour, the park offers extremely little to see and experience. There is a nature trail that offers a few nice overlooks and we were able to come face to face with a few deer and wild turkeys.

Mammoth Cave,"We traveled to Mammoth cave knowing a little about it, but I was overall impressed with the tours. First off, we have 5 and 6 year old children. The 5 year old did not have to pay to do either of the tours. Nothing was too difficult for our children to do.The Historic Tour had many steps up and down, though it was not too difficult for anyone in our family. My children were awestruck by the tour. It featured really large passageways but very little cave formations. The stories told by the ranger really made the tour.The New Entrance Tour was, to me and my wife, much more intriguing. Though not as long in terms of distance as the Historic Tour, it was really neat to descend vertically in the cave through several pits. You also get to see some really nice cave formations in this tour. Unlike the Historic Tour, there weren't very many stairs to climb, mostly to descend.We would like to have done some longer tours, or any other tour to a different part of the cave, but these were the longest ones that they tour in the summer (some of the other tours included the places we went on these two tours). Our kids also were able to experience their Junior Ranger program, which they enjoyed. I don't know if it is always the same every session, but our session was about bats.","July 3, 2013",New Entrance Tour and Historic Tour,6,"Paducah, Kentucky",4
Mammoth Cave,"This cave was magnificent! We choose the cheapest tour which was $4 but I wish we would have chosen a longer guided tour because I would have loved to see more of this cave. I would say you probably wouldn't want to bring children under 3 because there are a lot of stairs. And if you have to carry them getting down to the cave it would be difficult. Be sure to make your reservation before you come, the $4 tour didn't need one, but I noticed the others were booked up quickly. And bring a jacket it is cool down there. What else can I say about mother nature it speaks for it self. I will be back. OH they don't make you pay for parking either!

It was supposed to be a 2 hour tour but was about 20 minutes less than that. I think it was shorter because the group was smaller than usual. I liked the tour from the standpoint that we had to go straight down into a big pit before the tour started. Many stairs down, but not as many going up.

As I noticed the temperature difference from outside to inside the cavern....bothered some people. Inside temp...around 54 degrees. Tour fees are reasonable, if you have a National Parks Access card, use it for a discount. I understand they do have a program for children that is free. There is a snack wagon available near the Welcome centre, or three restaurants to choose from. Two of those do not open early in the morning. There is also the Mammoth Caves Hotel.

Mammoth Cave,"My three year old daughter and I visited Mammoth Cave today. It was a nice experience. We went on the ""New Entrance"" cave tour. My daughter's admission was free & I think I had to pay twelve dollars for mine, which is well worth it. Took a short bus ride to the cave, then headed underground. To start, you'll have to go down approximately 300 steps or so, and they're all different sizes, heights, and shapes, some where you need to weave around portions of rock. I'm not complaining I had fun, and surprisingly, so did my daughter. I just wanted to give out this information to help anyone considering this adventure-- definitely not handicap accessible, or for anyone with bad knees (or any other major health concern). My only real complaint, which I know is no one's fault & there can't be anything done about this, is that there were way too many giant legged cave crickets crawling inches away from my face, clothes, and hair, on the low ceilings and cramped walls. Those things terrify me, so I shrieked an awful lot more than I'd care to admit. Otherwise, a fun outing!

We booked ahead online, which I highly recommend. Our main guide was Matt with another guide named Eric. We travel often and this was one of the best tours we have ever taken. Matt was an amazing storyteller. The cave tour was two and a half hours long and my teens did not get bored at all. This is a tour they will remember a lifetime. Each section of the cave that you explore has a different story. For example, one section has small huts that were used by patients with tuberculosis hoping to be cured. Another section shows writings on the ceilings that were done in the early 1800s by burning black spots with candles. These are only two examples of the history given on the tour. The way in which the stories were told was fascinating. Being in the cave with lanterns as the only light source was a very unique experience. Although this tour focuses on the historical aspects of the cave, Matt was able to answer any of the science questions asked. This tour was well worth the drive from Nashville.

Mammoth Cave,"My 8 year old was very interested in seeing Mammoth Cave, so when we came to Louisville to visit my sister- I looked up how far away it was. Seeing that it was less than 2 hours away, we went for it. I read reviews that suggested making reservations ahead of time over the phone during the summer, so I booked the New Entrance tour which is a 2 hour tour. Here is my quick feedback as we just returned to Louisville after visiting- first off, time goes BACK AN HOUR from Louisville time- crazy, but true. So, when I reserved a 10 am tour, we showed up and it was only 8:45 am. Luckily we were able to join an earlier group as it was not sold out. I took my 5 year old, my 8 year old and my 11 year old niece. We bought headlamps at Target before going which was a very fun addition to the trip. I dressed them in jeans, a short sleeve and we brought light sweatshirts as it's cold in the cave. I thought we were well prepared. I lugged my heavy camera just in case and was so glad I did as my pictures (wo flash) were awesome. Our guide was good and my kids loved being in the cave. After about 1 hour and 15 minutes they were asking when it was over- but that's okay- and we ended up finishing a bit early - so we were back to the visitor center by 10:45. I took them to lunch at a cafe on the property which was pretty good and inexpensive. Of course we hit the gift shop too and then headed back to Louisville. Totally worth it!","June 27, 2013",super fun day trip with kids!,58,Ft Collins,5
Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I have been before but it was the first visit for our kids ages 7 and 10. Booked online about a month in advance and quickly picked tickets up that morning. Started with the Frozen Niagara tour, had lunch at Troglobytes and then did the Historic Tour. Highly recommend pants and light jackets. Tour guides were engaging and the caves, while not as flashy as some, are awe-inspiring in their sheer magnitude and history. ","June 26, 2013",A national treasure,19,"Marion, IA",5
Mammoth Cave,Each of our national parks is a treasure and offer something new and unique. This park's main attraction is underground but the scenery and view on top are amazing and sometimes over looked. We went on the historic cave tour which lasts about 2 hours. The rangers are amazing with all their knowledge and background of the caves.,"June 26, 2013",worth seeing,3,"Buffalo Grove, Illinois, United States",4
Mammoth Cave,"We did the Historic Tour in the morning, and the New Entrance Tour in the afternoon. Tours are well organized and the rangers all did a great job. They are very upfront on the literature, when you book the tours, and when you gather to start the tours about people considering their limitations and that the tours can be physically challenging in places. I consider myself in good shape for someone that is almost 60, and while there were places I stooped, or bent, or stretched, or squeezed through, I made it with no real problems. BUT, there are things that I considered common sense that some people didn't find as obvious so I wanted to emphasize some points. These caves are 55 degrees at the height of summer. Have a jacket and wear long pants. They have fit the tour to the cave, not the cave to the tour, so wear good walking shoes and be prepared to steps, some steep areas, slick surfaces and wet areas. We saw people in flip flops, shorts and sleeveless tops, and they seemed to be having their difficulties navigating the more challenging areas. I would also recommend against taking a child that needs to be carried, because you are dealing with steep narrow stairs, and other tight places that are hard to get through. But I definitely found the tour worthwhile overall.","June 26, 2013",Worth the trip,23,,5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave really is a great place to see. We took the Mammoth Passage Tour. Our guide did a great job interpreting, and we got to see just enough of the cave to whet our appetites. Next time through, we'll take the longer, more involved Historic Tour.Something we missed in the promo materials is that the Mammoth Cave hotel, next to the visitors center, has kennels for rent. We could have brought our dog and kept him onsite instead of back at our RV.","June 26, 2013",It really is...mammoth!,53,"Homosassa Springs, Florida",5

We will come back next year and do one of the longer , more expensive tours and see if they are better. We had 3 children ranging in age from 9-13 and they kept acting up so we could tell they were bored. Afterward we went to the Lost River underground cave tour and they were quite as church mice and not acting up (it was awesome). Prices at Mammoth are reasonable.

Mammoth Cave,"We loved the Frozen Niagara tour with Ranger Joe. I won't bother going into lots if detail about the park and cave tours, as there are tons of reviews on them already. But I will give some insight into the cave tour reservation process. For almost all of the tours, you can reserve tickets online as long as it is 24 hours before tour time. You may pick up your pre-purchased tickets at the will-call window inside the visitor's center. If the online tickets are sold out, don't give up yet. The park only sells up to half of the tickets for each tour online. There are always tickets available at the visitor's center on tour day. That said, be warned that you still have to plan ahead. The visitor's center opens at 8:15 am daily. I showed up at 8:00 am on a June Saturday, and I was already 30 people back in line. When the doors opened, there were probably at least 60 people in line. Luckily, not everyone is trying to take the same tour! Once inside, I waited about 10 or 15 minutes to get through the line. There were tickets remaining for the tour we wanted. There are monitors inside the visitor's center that are updated to show which tours are sold out for the day. I recommend having your top few choices selected so you have back-up plans ready if your preferred tour isn't available. All of the park staff we encountered were very knowledgable and helpful.

Mammoth Cave,"We have lived in KY since 1989. We went to Mammoth Cave for the 1st time on June 14, 2013. We should have gone years ago so we would have had numerous trips by now. It was Outstanding. It was better than we thought it would be. There are many tours to choose from. The park is beautiful. There is enough to do to spend the night, or a couple of nights. You can ride bikes around the big park.There is a little ferry on one of the roads which is worth doing (free) even if you really don't need to go to the other side. I cannot say enough great things about Mammoth Cave. Be sure to read about the tours if you have problems with steps or claustrophobia so you can decide what is right for you.","June 24, 2013",Make Time To Go To Mammoth Cave,46,"Paducah, Kentucky",5
Mammoth Cave,"Realizing none of our 3 kids (all born and raised in KY) had yet been to Mammoth, we ventured out for the day to visit. It is an easy drive from Louisville (1.5 hours from East Louisville). The visitor center had been upgraded greatly since we last visited - -very nice with two dining areas (casual and dining room - - but both the same menu) and two gift shops. If you are traveling with kids (ours are 12, 10 & 7), be sure to stop at the ranger desk and get the Junior Ranger books. Your kids fill out the games, puzzles and info while they wait for their tour or as they go, and earn their junior ranger badge and certificate upon completion - - only offered in National parks. All 3 of my kids were excited to get their badge.The amount of tours may be confusing and it is a bit frustrating that you can't reserve the day of your trip. However if you are a first time visitor, do the Historic or the New Entrance (both if you have all day). The historic tour takes you through the VASTNESS of Mammoth and gives lots of interesting facts, history and info about the cave. There are no interesting stalagmites or stalagtites or many ""living"" things in this part of the cave, as it is mostly dried in passages. Fat Man's Misery and the large domed rooms are the highlight of this trip. If you want to see the beauty of the caves (the living stalagmites and stalagtites and drapes, etc), do the New Entrance tour. It gives you more of a feel of the beauty of the caves. My husband and I have been many times and it is one of our favorite tours. If you have time to do both tours, do the history first and then break for lunch and do the New Entrance tour in the afternoon. It gives you a feel for all aspects of the cave. There is also a tour for kids ages 8-12 where they put on the suits and the hard hats with lights and go into areas of the caves adults can't really go easily. We saw this group (about 10-12 of them) as we were touring this time and they seemed to be having a blast. My kids want to go back and do that tour now!!The area surrounding the caves is gorgeous too. If you have time to stay and enjoy the park, do it. The horseback riding (we did this years back) is really nice. There are lots of natural rocks that you can find near the streams and rivers that, when broken open, reveal beautiful geodes inside. We always try to grab a few as we hike so we can split them open at home with a chissel and hammer to see what is inside.","June 23, 2013","A ""Must See"" in Kentucky -- Here's help picking your tour",144,"Louisville, KY",5

We did the new entrance, wild cave, intro to caving, lantern,and the historical tour. All were great !! I cannot say enough good things about the park staff--they are so polite ,knowledgeable, and passionate about the cave!! We also ate at Travertine restaurant and the coffee shop and were very pleased with the food and the service.

Mammoth Cave,"My wife and I have visited several caves/caverns over the years and this was an opportunity to vist the world's largest (in terms of total length of explored passages). We took the New Entrance tours and it was 250 feet down stairs before the tour began. May people on the tour were not equipped to walk in a cave (ie. flipflops and sandals) and that tended to slow down the entire group of 110 people. This was a group that was verging on too large to handle effectively in my opinion, but it worked out alright in the end. The hike itself was around 3/4 of a mile underground and the path was very uneven and slippery in spots, but there were hand rails much of the way. Much of our tour focussed on portions of the cave system that were formed by break away rock, not many stalagmite/stalactite formations until near the end of the tour. Overall it was a pretty good experience.","June 23, 2013",Interesting tour... moderately challenging,41,"Ontario's Highlands, Canada",5

Mammoth Cave,"My sons and I took the Historic Tour at Mammoth Cave. I had been on this tour several times since the 1970s, but had never taken my children as we have moved out of the area-- seeing it for the first time through their eyes made it a brand-new experience. (I am glad that I waited until they were a little older, though as this tour had over 400 stairs to navigate and there were several young children on our tour that had some difficulty with the sheer number)Our guide, Ranger Eric, was excellent with the right combination of stops with commentary and just letting the group walk and absorb the sights of the cave. I had purchased tickets online, but we arrived at the cave earlier than expected. It was no problem to obtain tickets for an earlier tour, but be aware that you will forfeit the $3 / per person fee for buying online if you decide to cancel/refund those tickets and purchase for an earlier time. On our weekday early afternoon visit, the Troglobites snack bar was uncrowded for a quick lunch with reasonable (for a tourist attraction) prices. I would imagine that it might not be as efficient on a busy weekend... We peeked in to the hotel and the two associated gift shops and it felt like stepping back in time-- they were still EXACTLY as I remembered from 20-30 years ago (sights and smells!) It made me feel that I was able to give my sons very much the same experience that I had in my own childhood!","June 21, 2013",Excellent Historic Tour!,188,United States,5
Mammoth Cave,"Awesome. Get your reservations early. We were extreeeeeemly lucky to have gotten two really good tours because we were a party of six. Frozen Niagra and historic Mammoth. Five year old was cranky on first tour but two older boys were impressed as was elderly mama. These were the easiest of the tours but one with a lot of stairs and a big hill. There are plenty of seats to rest though if needed. This by far was the most beautiful national park I've ever visited to include the visitor center. From having a ranger led tour to the mammoth exhibit, it will not disappoint. There are many trails which we didn't get to take advantage of as we ran out of time. Lodging is a bit limited, but if you plan, you have plenty of options. Jellystone cabins are the bomb!","June 20, 2013",Nothing but excellent! Went all three days to the park.

The whole tour is guided and was very rushed. I know it's dark in the cave but it is the poorest lit one I've been in. The people were nice and the prices good, just didn't feel it was worth the time I spent to get there. Also, the town nearby, Cave city has nothing to do. Stayed at days inn and they were great, but was quite bored here. If you can go to Carlsbad or Marvel cave. Much better.","June 19, 2013",Not the best cave or tour,53,"Kissimmee, Florida",3
Mammoth Cave,"We visited Mammoth Cave National Park on a Thursday and Friday in June. Our first stop was the visitor's center. The visitor's center is one of the best that I've visited in a National Park. It's quite new and very well organized. There is a museum with information about the formation of the cave and the history of the area. There is an information desk that includes TV monitors listing the tours and times that they depart. We noticed that some of the tours were sold out. If your schedule is tight or you are visiting on a summer or holiday weekend, then I recommend purchasing the tickets online before you arrive to the park. We purchased the Mammoth Passage Tour ticket onsite and the New Entrance Tour ticket online. The ticket counter was very efficient and we did not have to wait. We stopped by the gift shops at the lodge next to the visitor's center. The whole building smelled of cigarette smoke. If you are a non-smoker, this building is quite undesirable. After walking from the visitor's center to the hotel gift shops, I felt like I walked back in time 20 years. This was the only negative aspect of the park. Hopefully, the park can update their lodging soon. We took the guided Slavery at Mammoth Cave walking tour and found it to be very informative. The park ranger was very knowledgeable about the history of the Mammoth Cave area. The tour left from the visitor's center. After the guided walking tour, we took the Mammoth Passage tour. This tour enters the cave through the Historic entrance which is a short walk from the visitor's center. It goes into a large room in the cave and you can see the remains of a saltpeter mining operation. If you want to see stalagmites and stalactites, then this isn't the tour for you. This was a very easy tour and is suitable for people who may have difficulty walking or families with young children. Most of the commentary on this tour was the same as the Slavery at Mammoth Cave walk. If you take the Slavery at Mammoth Cave walk, I recommend taking a different cave tour. However, this is a good introductory tour to the cave.We also attend the evening program at the amphitheater. The program was about cave art and was presented by a park ranger. He spoke for about 45 minutes and had a slide show to accompany his discussion. It was very interesting and well presented. This program was suited more for ages 10 and up. It wouldn't have been interesting to young children. The following day we took the New Entrance cave tour. This tour met at the visitor's center, then we took a bus for about 10 minutes. This tour begins at an entrance through a sink hole. The tour leads down a few hundred stairs. This part of the cave is really cool and was my favorite part. Be warned, it is quite narrow in some places. The tour continued through the cave and finished at the Frozen Niagara. I highly recommend this tour.Mammoth Cave is an excellent National Park that shouldn't be missed if you're in the area.","June 19, 2013",Excellent National Park,192,"Chula Vista, California",5
Mammoth Cave,What a huge cave! We went on the historic tour with our two kids 5 and 7. We all had fun. I wished that the tour guide stopped to talk more and that we had more time to stop and look.

Would love to come back and do a different tour. ,"June 19, 2013",Huge,15,,3
Mammoth Cave,"I wish I COULlD review the cave but we never got in it. We spent 2 hours trying to find it and, even with directions from a man on sick leave who is a guide, we Still couldn't find it! They tell you to stay on a certain route but that route comes to a T intersection so which way to go? The park is pretty with lots of wildlife so drive carefully. We drove back and forth even with a GPS. Finally found it, took 10 min to find an open parking place because it was now 11:50 AM and they were packed. The Frozen Niagra tour we wanted was sold out and next one was over 4.5 hours so we couldn't wait. Things we learned: Call and reserve your tour in advance. Know for sure how to find the cave. Niagra tour is shortest and easiest of the tours. There are restrooms at the visitor center where you get tickets and they take you by bus to the cave the sign says. There are lots of seats to wait for your tour and, of course, they have a gift shop. I do want to state that this is not a review of the cave as we never got in it. They need more signs with more details on how to find it. There was no phone service back in the park.","June 19, 2013",Lack of signs,61,"York, Pennsylvania",2

Mammoth Cave,"I've visited caves all over the world - but nothing prepared me for the enormity of Mammoth Caves. With 400 (!) miles of surveyed tunnels and caverns, in addition to an estimated 600 miles of unsurveyed area, Mammoth Caves is easily the largest cave system in the world. Carved out of a limestone bed 1000 feet deep and extending across three states, Mammoth was first explored over 4000 years ago. European settlers encountered it in early explorations and it has been an attraction since the end of the War of 1812.Not as 'decorated' as some other cave systems, Mammoth impresses nonetheless with its sheer immensity. The main cavern, accessed by the 'Natural' entrance boggles the senses with it's vast volume. Descriptions are inadequate - you have to experience it yourself. (Take the 'Historical' tour to see it best.)The most 'decorated' portion (think stalagmites, stalagtites, cave bacon, etc.) of the surveyed caverns is accessed on the 'New Entrance' tour.There are many other tours available, including Caving 101, where actual spelunking is taught.The guides we had on our tours were knowledgeable, engaging, and passionate about their underground world.We were fortunate to go on the New Entrance tour with a group of only 18 (maximum tour capacity 120) so were able to stop many more places than usual.Our larger (40 person) group on the Historical tour (maximum tour capacity 140) was easily accommodated by the huge caverns and tunnels, but we all couldn't be near the guide to hear his side comments while walking from stop to stop.With so much to do underground, don't neglect the above ground attractions of the park with its extensive system of hiking and interpretive trails, and ranger-lead activities.There's so much to experience, a 2 day stay would be pretty much the minimum. The 'luxe' hotel in the park has basic but comfortable accommodations (king bed, air conditioning, phones, private baths, tv, etc.), for around $85/night in June. There are cottages and other accommodations starting around $50 night (2 room cabin $65/night) with AAA discounts.There's a variety of dining options. We ate supper and breakfast in the main dining room, and had reasonably priced meals of better than average quality for a concession restaurant. In fact the Southern skillet-fried chicken was excellent, as were the biscuits (which turned out to be Pillsbury frozen dough - but were extraordinarily light, fluffy as and flavorful; I don't know how they did it.). Local cherry preserves are served at the table, and are good enough that you'll want to buy a jar to take home. Portions are large (to huge), many dishes can easily be shared. My wife ordered the $8.95 'Caveman' breakfast that was so much food it could have easily fed us both - and a kid or two.","June 18, 2013",A larger than life natural attraction - it's Mammoth!,44,"Seattle, Washington",5
Mammoth Cave,"We arrived on the way to another event and wanted to take the walking tour that was shorter and involved a bit less climbing/walking (for seniors with bad knees). The tour was scheduled for 9:15 and we arrived at 8:30 and went right to the box office. We stood in line for 25 minutes and when we got to the ticket seller were told that the tour we wanted was ""sold out"". As we could not physically do the longer tours and could not wait around for 3 hours for the next ""frozen niagara tour"" we left. There were lots of people walking around to tell you about options, but only two people working the ticket windows. I have no idea why the tour was ""sold out"" or why, under that circumstance they could not do a second smaller tour to follow the main group. Essentially the attitude was you do it our way or go away. So, we went away. If you are going to this site, I recommend you get reservations in advance (I did not explore that option when I went to the website), especially if you have a schedule, because the Park Service here is not at all interested in you needs.","June 18, 2013",Disorganized and Inefficient,43,"Wilmington, Delaware",2

Mammoth Cave,"Let me start off by saying, I thought I had written this review last summer when we visited! We were here last July of 2012. The temps outside were over 100, so heading down into a cave was a real treat! We didn't purchase the expensive cave tours, we just did the ""do it yourself"" one. It was a great intro to the caves and they had a few guides around to answer questions and let you know about the sites. You could choose to keep going, or stop and listen to what they were saying, it was truly a ""go at your own pace"". They had us walk across a special disinfectant to help the bats and that was just fine. It was a great tour, tickets were easy to get...fast and efficient. Helpful staff everywhere we looked. We would've like to have done more hiking along the trails and such, but the weather was just too hot, with no clouds to provide any relief. We already know we want to go back and purchase a regular tour and take advantage of all the things this great place has to offer!","June 17, 2013",Absolutely awesome!,75,"St. Cloud, MN",5

My family is in good shape so beware if you are not, it is a lot of walking and climbing at a fairly fast pace. USE the restroom before caving! FYI~ eat a big meal before caving~ there are no snack bars or porta johns! LOL Kids disappointed they did not see bats but Mom wasn't! Found the story about the history of the caves to be very interesting, we brought up the tail end of both tours and it was like having our own personal guide to point things out and answer all our questions. I would suggest doing that! If you are scared of heights or enclosed places this is not where you want to end up! Tour guides were good, got to see lots of deer and wild turkeys on our drive thru the National Park, my kids were excited.

Mammoth Cave,"They have so many tours to choose from. My son chose the new entrance tour and it was amazing. Make sure your kids use the restroom before you leave, there are no restrooms on the new entrance tour and my 10 year old almost didn't make it.A woman and her two small girls backed out because of the tight entrance, so be forewarned. For the first hour you twist and curve your body to the cave's contours to descend about a million steps, all the while getting dripped on from the roof of the cave. This is the part I liked the most.For the last hour you get to see huge rooms with big chunks that look like they could collapse at any moment, this was the part I liked least. Campground was an amazing value and the bathrooms were well kept, not crazy about the shower token idea because it cost extra, but it was still decent. Shower area was not as clean as the campground bathroom near our campsite.Loved waking and falling asleep to the sounds of all the birds. Saw many deer and wild turkeys.Can't wait to come back with our mountain bikes, there are great trails.Better camp pads would make tenting better, the sites are not very grassy. Tons of poison ivy, so watch out. No fee to enter the park, but fees for tours of caves. Early morning tours are cheapest.

Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I took the New Entrance Tour and were extremely satisfied. We were a little worried about the amount of steps (500 total), but they were spread out with places to stop while the guide talked. It is an amazing cave and this tour allows you to see the stalactites. It's cool, so you may want a jacket and there are some tight squeezes around rocks and places you have to bend down. I was a little worried about 2 babies that women strapped to them when we walked in. Within the first few steps, the babies started screaming and they had to turn around and walk back out. I do think the park service needs to make some stronger restrictions on who is allowed in the cave. The tour is well worth the $12.The National Park is beautiful! It is clean and a great area for camping. We would love to go back and camp.","June 16, 2013",Wonderful tour and great national park,61,"Pinehurst, North Carolina",5

We too three cave tours: Historic, Star Chamber, Frozen Niagra, and Intro to Caving. The Historic Tour is a great medium length walking tour that gives you a nice overview of the cave, including saltpeter mini g in 1812, and tourism starting in 1813. The Star Chamber tour is done by lantern light for a spookier and more authentic experience. Our daughters loved it. The We also canoed on the Green River, stayed at the campground, and ate in the Travertine Restaurant.","June 14, 2013",Best National Park Trip Ever!,24,"Mobile, Alabama",5
Mammoth Cave,Amazing place!Perhaps 400 miles of caves all interconnected underground.The guides are good and the tours very well conducted.Yes the trip an be a little tiring for old people climbing up and down the steps underground and one cannot really change one's mind and trace back once you are in it as the people move in single file along the narrow cave routes.Little chilly underground- 16-17 deg C but quite pleasant if you have a light cardigan on,"June 14, 2013",Real underground experience,58,,5
Mammoth Cave,"My wife and I went on a little vacation in May to Mammoth Cave, Ky. First time. I am a senior citizen and although the tour guides warn you ahead of time that if you have health issues, or trouble climbing stairs do not go on the tour. They tell you that you have 300-500 stairs to challenge you. It's been so long that I've had to climb many stairs that I didn't think twice about it. My fault, I was warned. Out of the group we had, my wife and I held up the rear, not by choice. The tour guide Cevin was very rude. He told us to hurry up to the group. My wife explained that my legs are bad but he didn't care. He said that if I'm that bad off, we should be in front of the group where the slow people are. Uh? Didn't he think that we would be up front if we could? I mean, if the slow prople are in front, what were we? I wasn't asking for sympathy, just time. But all in all, we had a good time but if anyone out there has bad knees or legs, don't take the tours. And another thing, the cave walk ways are dim, they are wet and the stairs are wet. I did all I could do so as not to miss a step and fall. They should have some kind of yellow strip at the end of the step to warn you that the step has ended, some kind of safety mark. I have to wonder how many people over the years have missed a step or two walking down.","June 12, 2013",One step at a time.,8,Detroit,4
Mammoth Cave,"We did a historic tour and it was amazing. It's a long time underground, so take a cardigan, and don't go if you're overweight or claustrophobic.Our guide was hilarious and so knowledgeable. We went at the start of June in the early morning so our group was small (less than 50) but the tours can take up to 120! Consider booking early morning or off peak times for your tour - we don't think we would've enjoyed a large tour group as much.","June 11, 2013",Cave tours are fantastic,74,"London, United Kingdom",5

Mammoth Cave,"On our drive back to Texas after a snowy Christmas in the Midwest, we decided to stop and see Mammoth Cave. I had visited it as a kid 40 years ago and had wanted to see it again. My partner had never seen it. During the winter, only a few tours were available to meet our schedule. We chose the Frozen Niagra tour. We purchased tickets online before the trip and picked them up at will-call at the park headquarters. The tour is located at a remote cave entrance and we had a bus load of tourists on the tour. It was about an hour long. Easy access, easy walk. The cave is large enough that my claustrophobia was not a factor, much to my relief. It’s a magnificent experience that deserves another visit.","June 11, 2013",Magnificent hole in the ground,16,Dallas,4
Mammoth Cave,"My wife and I spent two days here and had a ton of fun. We made online reservations for the intro to caving tour, but could not make reservations for the campground because it said it was full. We decided to try it anyway and showed up at the main mammoth campground hoping for the best.It turns out there are quite a lot of sites (we were tent camping) avsilable if you do not have reservations, so it worked out well. The campground was great, right in the middle of everything and is definitely the place to stay. There is a great, flat, bike trail that goes right by, trails, and you are right by the visitor center and evening ranger programs.We did the intro to caving tour and would definitely reccomend it. Make sure you wear good, high top boots, the rangers will check them and they turned back 2 people on our tour. They give you a jump suit, knee pads, helmet, and light. There will be a locker to keep your stuff in and you can bring a camrta with you...but it needs to be waterproof or in a bag.. you will get wet and dirty. The price was reasonable too, all in all a great trip.","June 10, 2013",Love it!,52,"Estes Park, Colorado",5

Mammoth Cave,"We traveled here with 2 young kids. Park was wonderful to drive through and welcome center was very nice. Ranger staff was very friendly and helpful. They guided us to the Mammoth passage tour which is the shortest of their tours. This was great since our 3 and 5 year olds would not have been up for a multiple hour tour of the caves. This tour was approx 45 mins and all walking. It kept everyone's interest and was well worth it.The park is free to enter and explore, but tours into Mammoth cave are guided and will cost a small fee.BE AWARE that this is a cave and is a constant 55 degrees in summer and winter. We did not think about this and our kids were cold about half way through the tour. We would do this tour again!","June 9, 2013",Beautiful park filled with wildlife and great scenery,26,"Luckenbach, Texas",4
Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I stopped here on our way from Nashville to Indiana, and boy are we glad we did! We had reserved our tickets in advance on recreation.gov which was convenient, for the 1:45 Historic Tour. We actually arrived early enough to make the 12:45 tour, and they changed our reservations with no problem. We had Ranger Joe, who was funny and informative. He started out by listing the warnings about going on this, since it was listed as moderate. I am overweight, and not in the best shape, but I could handle this just fine, it's just a lot of stairs at the end.The cave was massive, and beautiful. We got to see the cave cricket and a few bats. Learning about the history and seeing the graffiti was very interesting. The ranger let us know that the tour can hold up to 100 people, but we were only a tour group of 18. (I would highly recommend going in the middle of the week like we did). He was able to spend more time explaining the history of the cave to us which was really awesome.My favorite parts were the bottomless pit, the fat man's misery, and the mammoth dome. The tour lasted two hours, but it seemed very quick, as I was interested the whole time.Just a few pointers (some which are on their website)1. Wear sneakers2. Wear a light coat/sweatshirt (I read this and was so glad that I did this as it was cool in the cave)3. Reserve your tour online.","June 5, 2013",Historic Tour was Excellent,59,"Warren, Rhode Island",5

I never realized there were so many lifeforms able to survive in complete darkness deep within the earth. We toured 2 caves, one was a dry cave that showed the differant levels of rock and soil that formed over millions of years. The other was a damp cave the had stalactites and stalagmites as well as a feww over formations formed by water depositing minerals.

The tour involved several climbs, and narrow spaces to squeeze through, but he was patient in waiting for the slower ones, although people with mobility problems may find it difficult - we were warned before entering and allowed to back out before we went in - no one did!!I particularly enjoyed the complete silence and darkness experience, when all lights are extinguished and everyone sits completely in silence.

If the water level is just right you can paddle right into a small cave. There are two places for horseback riding, several biking trails, miles and miles of hiking trails, and of course plenty caves. I wish we had gone there when our kids were little because they would have loved the Dinosaur World. The newest attraction is zip lining.

Mammoth Cave,My mom and I visited Mammoth Cave and only had to do 1 tour so we decided on the Historic Tour. We were not diappointed at all! I'm 31 and my mom is 61 and even though the tour describes this as moderate we were both able to complete the cave tour with no problem. The tour guide was extremely knowledgable and the cave was absolutely gorgeous. We were lucky because there may have been only around 50 people in our tour which is small compared to the 120 limit they allow. The pace was steady (not a leisurely walk) and slower people were allowed to be near the front for convenience. If I'm ever in the area again I will definitely do another cave tour.

Mammoth Cave,"I love our National Parks and all of the beauty each one has to offer. This park has you going through tours in the cave where you have to bend and twist and twist and bend and squeeze and turn just to get through some of the caves, but it was super fun. Wondered sometimes what would happen if someone got stuck; how would we get through, but that didn't happen. The caves have tours for every level of adventure, even the crawling through places where you can't do anything but scoot because you can't move your arms or raise your head, because it's so tight. THAT, was not for me, I am very claustrophobic and had a hard enough time in the cave mazes themselves. Great place to enjoy the hidden caves and the outside park. The cabins are rustic and fun to stay in.","May 27, 2013",Amazing,25,"Waverly, Iowa, United States",5
Mammoth Cave,"What can I say. Just another superb National Park. Great visitors centre and hotel. I went on the 2 hour New Entrance cave tour, which my wife passed on as she's claustrophobic, but she found plenty to do and eat in the visitors centre and hotel. Must say it was nice to see hotel and eating place attached. I can well understand that NP don't want to spoil their places but I do think they could do more on food and drinks; make some money; and keep it tasteful and in keeping with their surroundings. A missed opportunity.Back to the tour. It was awesome. Took 2 hours. I've been on some amazing NP guided tours / walks and they never fail to delight but this tour had to take the top prize for safety, professionalism, content, narrative, interest.

Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I went on the Historic Tour and enjoyed it. The cave system is amazing and the tour was worth the $12 entry fee. We only had time for one tour and we were glad we picked this one, as you get to see a lot of cave in the two hour tour. I'd recommend booking your tour online ahead of your visit if you have your heart set on a certain tour and time (the tours sell out fast). My only complaint about the tour is that the other tour group members were a bit inconsiderate (which I suppose happens in a group of 120 people). Even though our tour guide reminded people many times to be careful with their camera flashes, people still were flashing away whenever they wanted, which meant we were often blinded! This tour has some slippery, uneven footing, tight spaces and many stairs. I wouldn't recommend it if you are not in decent physical condition--there are other easier tours to take instead.

There is even a tour using lanterns in the dark.The formations, the sheer size of this underground world, the history of mining in the 1800's with remnants left...it is really awesome.

Mammoth Cave,"It is clearly the largest cave system in the world and when you see some of the different ""rooms"" and formations, you will be in awe. I did the New Entrance and Historic Tours on one day and the Snowball Tour the next. All are different. I would do it that way again. New Entrance was the most demanding as you have to walk a lot bent over (I am tall). Snowball was the easiest -- even though it was the longest. Ate lunch (which was not great - turkey and cheese on bread, soup, drink, extremely small pasta salad, cookie and apple) underground which is kind of fun. Definitely wear a sweatshirt and take a flashlight with you. Wish I had the flashlight as you will be away from the tour guides (Joe was the best and very funny) at times and want to see in unlit areas. All in all, well worth the two days. Also there is a little cafe in the Mammoth Cave Hotel building that has a very delicious menu that is VERY reasonable in price. A good place to eat lunch in-between tours.","May 24, 2013",Bring a flashlight,49,"Loveland, OH",5

Mammoth Cave,"This was my wife and I's first visit to mammoth cave. We arrived at the visitors center with a few minutes to spare. They have a really nice little walkthrough that goes into detail of the history that may be of interest to some. We had booked our reservation for New Entrance ahead of time at 12:15, but looking at the board many tours were actually still available. I'm guessing May is still not the busiest time of year. The new entrance tour takes a bus ride into the middle of the woods far away from the ""classic"" entrance. The entrance itself is not exactly photographic, it is a steel door, but that is where the mundane ends and the wonder begins. Stepping through the door and down the steps and you are immediately in the cave. I felt like I was in a movie as we journeyed down. TIP: They say this tour is only moderate, but I have to say they don't mention size and some of those passageways may be very daunting for very large people, we didn't have anyone that size but it just seemed it could be kind of tight, so maybe ask the visitor center if you are concerned.TIP: They say there are stairs what they don't tell you is they wind down a long ways and require some ducking. Older people may also want to make sure this tour is for them.TIP: The descent is the only time someone with a fear of heights may get nervous because you realize how far down you are going.All these tips being said we thought the descent was actually one of the best parts. It is amazing to see the domes and rooms that you are walking through. The tour itself once you get to the bottom becomes much easier. You walk through some large caverns and as others have mentioned at one point sit in total darkness. Our guide was absolutely fantastic. The best storyteller I have ever had on a tour. He told of the man who discovered the New Entrance route in such a fascinating way. I didn't get his whole name but I believe it was Tom. I was just blown away by how great he was with the questions anyone asked. He truly seemed to enjoy his job and that made it enjoyable for us.The tour concluded at frozen Niagara where you get to see all sorts of stalagtites and stalagmites. The steps out are minor and like I said the descent is by far the most strenous part. We never really felt rushed and he would wait for anyone taking pictures for however long needed. I must say overall this tour was great the only drawback is looking on the map it is a very small part of the cave system. Next time when we return we will definitely take the historic tour. One more thing the park center originally had the tour that included a school field trip, but they split us up and we ended up with a small group. Kudos to that entire place because it is well run and they offer top notch guides. We cannot wait to explore the cave more.","May 18, 2013","Tour of New Entrance May 18, 2013 (A couple)",27,"Avon Lake, Ohio",4

Mammoth Cave,"I had very low expectations based on my visits to other dated or run-down state parks, but Mammoth Cave is very well-maintained! The tours are very organized and punctual. My boyfriend and I went on the ""New Entrance"" tour and it was fascinating. Our tour guide, Myles, provided the perfect combination of history and humor. FYI, this tour is not recommended for very large people, the claustrophobic, or those of you will joint trouble… it's a strenuous and tightly-confined hike. I was sore all over the next day. One last note… this should go without saying, but be considerate of the other people on the tour with you... We had a large group of young people yelling, laughing, and goofing off, and it really inhibited our enjoyment of the experience. P.S. We also walked a couple miles on the surface trails (self-guided) and there are some great sights to see on these, as well! ","May 15, 2013",Great fun… and exercise. :/,7,"Taos, New Mexico",5
Mammoth Cave,"Overall, this is a great park. The grounds are immaculately kept, the staff is professional and friendly, the facilities are first class, and the cave itself is just as awesome as you would hope.My only small complaint is with the tour descriptions. You can only get in the cave by guided tours, so this is important. While they were superficially accurate, the description of each tour by the guide while you wait to begin could be vastly improved. In one case, the guide made such a big deal about the hazards and difficulties to be encountered that a few people backed out at the last moment. They could easily have made it, but were put off by the rigors described by the guide, which turned out to be highly exaggerated.In another case, the guide seemed to be describing a different tour than the one he was about to lead, because the actual conditions were rather different.My advice would be to read the tour descriptions carefully, then get there early enough to chat with the people leaving the previous tour (they're closely spaced in time) to get a reality check.With that small issue aside, I enjoyed my visit a great deal.","May 13, 2013","An excellent park, but choose your tours carefully.",67,"Cincinnati, Ohio",4

Mammoth Cave,"I visited with my family who have all been to a variety of cave tours around the world, however, Mammoth Cave was a completely unique experience and nothing like any of us have seen before. Take Frozen Niagara tour for an hour long non strenuous, no tight spots/high spots, look into Mammoth Cave. Take the Historic tour (recommended by most tour guides) for a two hour, slightly strenious, adventure into the cave (there are heights and tight places). Best to book tickets in advance. Wear good walking shoes, the cave is always around 56 degrees so dress accordingly. I would spend at least two days visiting if possible, though packing a visit into one day is an option the tours are tiring so I'm not sure how many a group would be able to do and still enjoy.We took the Frozen Niagara tour and the Historic Tour. Initially we signed up for the Frozen Niagara tour to get a feel of the cave, we're not incredibly physically fit so we were worried about signing up for any other tour without discussing our options with some park rangers. We arrived at the visitor center where most of the tours begin. The Visitor center is extremely well kept with a wonderful, newly finished, museum that is very informative about the cave. Mammoth Cave is a national park so there is no fee to enter the park or for the visitor center/museum but there is a reasonable fee for each tour.We talked with many of the rangers throughout our time there, all were very helpful and discussed what you will see through each tour. Do not hesitate to ask about tours and what they would recommend or any worries/questions you have about what tour would be best for you. They are very well educated and are happy to help. They suggested we take the Historic Tour as well and that it was a bit strenuous but nothing we couldn't handle.The Frozen Niagara tour is absolutely perfect for young kids, out of shape, or elderly people. You get a nice feeling for what Mammoth cave is. You also get to see some of the few formations in the cave. It is a short tour, running about an hour long and not a lot of walking is involved.The Historic Tour is amazing and a great adventure for someone who may not be fit enough to take the intense tours but healthy enough to do some walking and stairs. You get to see some of the largest portions of the cave, go around 310 feet into the cave system, stand over the ""bottomless pit"", see some historic graffiti, and hear about the incredible history of the cave and the people who have traveled through it. This tour is two hours and a two mile walk including around 400 stairs. This sounds daunting to anybody who may not be very active but the stairs are broken up, the longest stretch being around 150, so it really is not incredibly difficult. I went with my father who is older and has had leg injuries and, though tired, he did not have problems making it through.I would love to visit again and take all the tours at some point, the cave is an amazing spectacle and an important part of our history. It should be seen at least once in your life time!I also have to mention Ranger Amanda, who was an amazing guide on the Historic Tour. Not one of the people on our tour wanted to miss anything she said, she told every bit of history like it was an amazing tale and we were all enthralled. Couldn't have wished for a better guide!","May 11, 2013",Not like other caves! Must see at least once in a lifetime!,125,"Romeo, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,I stopped to break up the drive from northern Indiana to nashville. The two hour cave tour was great. It was easy to get on the next tour as we were traveling during the week in the spring season. A little more planning maybe required on summer weekends. Admission to the park itself is free and the cave tour was only $12. It would be completely free to explore some of the hiking trails on your own. I was not impressed with the restaurant selection at the park. There are sit down dining options only and even ordering a peanut butter jelly sandwich was slow. ,"May 11, 2013",A great place to stop between Louisville and Nashville,195,"Palm Coast, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"I went to the national park thinking I was going to see a cave and all the interesting formations and bats. My national park ranger led tour instead gave us so much more with a wonderful, humorous history lesson of an attraction that has been around since the early 1800s. This world heritage site offers so much more than simply another cave crawl. The flora and fauna on the 53,000 acre site alone are worth the visit. The forest has an amazing variety of trees. Walking through the forest on the trails was equal to any walk through a jungle in foreign lands with its bird calls and forest sounds. Their are several tours available and I highly recommend taking the 2 to 3 hour ranger led tour to get the most out of your trip. Our ranger had a delightfully dry sense of humor and could tell stories in a slow southern drawl to delight even the high school group we happened to get matched up with. What you won't find are formation after formation of odd shapes I typically find in many caves. This cave is about the size and grandeur of its 400 miles of caverns and tunnels.

Mammoth Cave,The historic tour was great. We went on the 11:30 tour and dodged a bus load of kids lol. This tour was a work out! I'm in decent shape and my calves were sore the next day.

Mammoth Cave,"Yes, there are many tours from novice to expert, but the only one available for young children or people with limited mobility is the Frozen Niagra tour. No backpack child-carriers or strollers allowed because of the low clearance and narrow passageways, but a front (chest) carrier is ok. It was a fun experience and my young children liked it, but it does miss more in depth exposure if that is what you are looking for. The ranger made it fun, but I just wish there was another option for the young and old.","May 9, 2013",Frozen Niagra the only option for young children or elderly,24,"Chicago, Illinois",4
Mammoth Cave,"The park is clean and beautiful. The cave is obviously large and impressive. Our Guide Dave was friendly and knowledgeable. Other helper Dave was not as much fun. We went on a Saturday in late April, so we bought our tickets in advance. We did the Snowball Room. The cave was fine. Not as pretty as other caves I have been to. The snowballs were neat. It was neat eating lunch in the cave, probably will never get to do that again in my life.What ruined the experience for my family (with 2 pre-teen kids), was the other children. Apparently it was ""Scout Day"" or something, because about half of the tour was under 10. They were NOT well behaved. They were NOT listening or following directions. They were VERY LOUD. It sounded like a McDonalds play land. Apparently, parenting is very relaxed where ever these kids where from. The guide told everyone, stressing the kids to turn out their lights (you know, the flashlights they were shining in everyone's faces). He turned out the cave lights and not 2 seconds later a little brat turned on their light and ruined the experience.I love caves. I hadn't been to Mammoth Caves since I was a kid. I was very excited to travel 500 miles by car for this tour, it was pretty disappointing. Our tour of Jewel Caves in South Dakota was a much better experience.","May 7, 2013",Beautiful area... cave is neat.... tour could have been better.,60,"Leitchfield, Kentucky",3
Mammoth Cave,"We really enjoyed our tour of Mammoth Cave. We took the ""New Entrance"" cave tour and found it very exciting. I love a good cave adventure and this tour didn't disappoint.

Mammoth Cave,Took my daughter and met some of her friends at Mammoth Cave in Kentucky over Christmas break. I've always wanted to visit the cave and I wasn't disappointed. There are several tours you can take of different lengths. We took the New Entrance tour which took about two hours. Well worth the trip.,"May 7, 2013",Caving at Christmas,4,"Reisterstown, Maryland",5
Mammoth Cave,"I had six hours in Mammoth Cave and managed to do two cave tours and the Cedar Sink trail hike in between. Wished I had more time! The first tour was ""New Entrance"" which lasted 2 hours and is rated moderate. This is one of about 25 man-made entrances to the caves in the park (there is only one natural entrance). You must descend and climb over 500 stairs, which is not difficult unless you have walking difficulties or heart ailments. This takes you to Frozen Niagara, which contains some of the best cave formations in the park (most of Mammoth Cave lacks stalactites, etc due to the layer of sandstone over the porous limestone in which the caves are formed). So if you want to see formations, do this tour. You are bussed a short distance to the entrance from the visitor center. I had some time before the second tour so grabbed a sandwich at the general store near the visitor center and drove 10 minutes to the Cedar Sink trailhead. This is a 45 min loop trail that takes you through a pretty forest to a large sinkhole and exposed section of an underground river, which forms the caves in the area. Very interesting to see. You must descend and ascend steps to do the loop but it's well worth it. The second tour was the ""Historic Tour"" which is a short walk from the visitor center and uses the natural entrance. You will learn about the slaves who labored in the cave for decades to mine the bat guano used to make gunpowder. Our guide was a descendent of one such slave whose name is found throughout the tour carved on the walls as an early example of graffiti. It was humbling to take this tour and realize how terrible the conditions were for the slaves. There are fewer formations on this tour, but the rooms were larger and more spectacular than the first tour. If you have time for only one tour, I'd select the Historic Tour. There are others as well. There is a hotel and restaurant next to the visitor's center if you wish to stay more than one day, which I would do the next time. I love our national parks -- they are to be cherished!","May 6, 2013",Mammoth Cave was a Great Stop,285,"Laguna Niguel, California",5

Next time.....","May 6, 2013",Very humbling and immense,159,"Claremont, New Hampshire",5

Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave exceeded the high expectations I had set for it. The grounds were beautiful, the park was clean and well organized, and the cave was truly unbelievable. The tours are extremely reasonably priced and quite entertaining.I went on the Violet City Lantern tour. The lantern aspect was unique and made me feel like an early explorer. The tour guide gave us quite a bit of history of the cave and we stopped twice on benches to rest and ask questions. The tour is considered ""strenuous"" but it was not physically taxing...just slippery going up and down the hills without proper footwear. In would recommend the Violet City Lantern tour, although 3 hours in the cave got a little tiresome and boring by hour 2.5 and the children in my group were definitely ready to be done by the end.Hint: Visiting on a rainy day was wonderful. We were dry, but The waterfalls in the cave and the sight of water trickling over the cave entrance were absolutely spectacular.","May 5, 2013",Incredible Experience,9,,5

Don't worry - the Snowball Tour (3 hours) and the Historical Tour (2 hours) are so different from one another that you will see plenty on these two. Don't expect stalagmites or stalactites in this cave - it's very dry so you won't see those. Still spectacular, big, and great guides lead the way. We were lucky to be there on a slow week and wound up on tours of 5 and 6 people, as opposed to the max of 120 people.

We took the ""Historic Tour"" in the morning which lasted about 2 hours and was a little on the strenuous side for our boys, 12 and 9. It was very informative, interesting and our guide was great. In the evening we took the ""Star Chamber"". This tour followed along the historic tour's route for quite a while but then veered off into a different branch of the cave. The star chamber itself was great. Our guide for this tour was Kath and she was awesome, a great story teller and very knowledgeable. We loved our trip and can't wait to go back. I would recommend booking the tours online ahead of time. It was convenient and saved us some time.","April 22, 2013",Awesome and humbling!!,22,"Chesterton, Indiana",5

Everyone there was very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The visitors center is beautiful, all new, and has a nice gift shop and exhibit. Though the tours might seem kind of expensive they are worth it because of the length is longer than most other caves and the guides are extremely knowledgeable about both geology and history of the cave. We also hiked on the trails which are very nice and maintained and saw beautiful views. We recommend going here to anyone! ","April 21, 2013",WONDERFUL!,11,"Bedford, Ohio, United States",5
Mammoth Cave,"We were three generations and could find a cave tour for each of us. Steve the Ranger was our favorite guide and set the standard for all others. Miles the Seasonal Ranger should get retrained. It really doesn't do to tell your tour participants that you don't know what you are talking about. We paid for these tours and have expectations. The three hour Snowball tour was great and we also like to view the Frozen Niagara Tour. We took the Wildflower walk in the morning. Again, the ranger on the walk apologized that he didn't know anything about the flowers but he shouldn't have. He was a wealth of information about The Sink and the history of the site. Much more interesting than flowers.","April 20, 2013",Something for everyone,99,"Boston, Massachusetts",4
Mammoth Cave,"A must see - you cannot believe how big the caverns are and how much history has taken place there. The new visitor center is beautiful but to really get a feel for the place you have to take a tour. We took the shortest but was not disappointed. We were able to spend a lot of time in the caverns, hear about the history from the park ranger, and just take in the wonders. Plan accordingly because the tours are only offered at specific times and sell out quickly.","April 17, 2013",A Natural Wonder,251,"Naperville, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"I took the 2 hour historical tour. It was ranked as a moderate tour. There were a couple of tight places to squeeze through and some slippery spots. Most of the tour is downhill into the depths of the caves, so the hardest part was the approximately 150 step staircase near the end of the tour followed by the long ramp out. However, my tour group included fourth grade and second grade school groups, and they handled the hike with no problem. The cave is cool, I believe they said around 58 degrees year round, but the hike kept me warm enough that I was carrying my jacket even before the staircase. There are no bathrooms in the caves, so go before you go.The tour itself was great. The ranger lead tour was informative about how the caves were formed, the history of the caves and what they have been used for since prehistoric times. I think what stood out the most was the lights off demonstration.The caves I toured did not have the classic stalagmite-stalactite formations other caves do. The surfaces were mostly smooth, making them kind of dull in comparison to other caves.Overall, this tour is well worth doing. When I return, I shall do other tours because there is so much more to see at Mammoth Caves.","April 16, 2013",Fun and informative cave tour,30,"Morris, Illinois",4

Mammoth Cave,"We did the Historic tour which was a 2½ hour, 2mile tour. The caves are not very spectacular like the Natural Bridge caves, but they do pack a punch in the history stakes. The tour is not particularly strenuous but it does take in some small spaces and tight spots but no one in our group had much difficultly, at the end there are about 150 steps to climb to get out and a steep slope to climb but we all managed. At some points the ground is a bit slippery so good shoes are needed. There were a lot of small children in the large group and they were getting a bit fed up and noisy towards the end and so it was quite hard to hear what the ranger had to say so may be this is not the tour for very young children. I would recommend booking ahead of time as when we arrived at will call the board for the day was already showing tours full.

Mammoth Cave,"I grew up in Kentucky and never once did I get to go to Mammoth Cave. This time we were on Interstate 65 when we experienced a truck wreck that closed the highway. Not wanting to sit in traffic we exited the Interstate at exit 53 and headed for Mammoth Cave. Should have our head examined as this was spring break week and when we arrived at the National park we begin to think ever student in the United States was at that location. The area was solidly packed and even finding a parking space was not easy. We went tot eh reception area hoping to go on a tour when we learned all tour were full for the day. We instead toured the reception area and watched a film on the explorations of Mammoth Cave. It was fascinating and worth the few minutes we spent there. A walk across a small bridge will take you to the hotel area, the restaurant and coffee shop. This are is vey nice and the buildings and sheds around the area are well maintained. We will go back however it will not be during spring break.As a TIP plan of staying all day at the park. There are almost 400 miles of caves, trails and canyons, although only a small percentage will be open to the public.If you have not gotten back to nature in a long time we felt like we had gone back decades.

Mammoth Cave,"The Mammoth Cave system is 400+miles of interconnected caves through central Kentucky. It is a desginated member of the seven natural wonders of the world. We purchased tickets the day before. Many of the tours were sold out already (spring break); we booked a 11:15 Historic Tour for three. When we arrived at 10:30 AM, the only tours left were at 4 and 5 pm... prepare ahead. Visitors are encouraged to pick up tickets 30 minutes before the tour. This tour starts after a 10-minute bus ride to the entrance of the cave. There were two rangers and about 115 people on the tour. The tour shows all three types of caves: the steep vertical cave made by the downward dripping of water, the horizontal caves buffeted above by sandstone, and the dying cave (Niagara Falls) with the spectacular curtain (the Drapery Room) of stalagtites. It is a 3/4 mi tour, but there are >200 stairs up and down. Some of the stairs are steep where you stare into the heel of the person in front of you. The ranger, Tom, was very knowledgeable about the history and composition of the caves. He told many amusing historic anecdotes and showed us many interesting things about the caves. We were able to see cave crickets; they hide in cracks, and it is advisable to bring a small flashlight to be able to see them. A nice, compact camera would be great. No food or drinks are allowed except water. No bathrooms for 2 hours. Some of this tour is very steep and narrow--- not a great idea if you are claustrophobic. There is constant water in the caves and it can be slippery. Wear hiking shoes or sturdy sneakers. Flip flops, heels, and loose sandals are not a good idea. There were also some families that brought very small children (under age 2). They will not enjoy this tour, as it is dark, long, and filled with talk, and they cannot have any snacks and will be constantly, slowly moving. There was much crying; I wasn't bothered but just felt sorry for the little kids. I recommend for kids ages 6 and above, and also other tours if you can squeeze them in.","April 8, 2013",Astounding natural treasure,197,"Fort Wayne, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"My family went to see the to see the New Entrance tour part of the Mammoth Caves in April of 2013. It is HIGHLY recommend (and I agree) that you purchase tickets online at the park website as most tours were sold out when I arrived at the park. When you purchase your tickets online, you wait in line and they will give you your tickets.The two tour guides were informative and funny when I could hear them. Since we had over 100+ people it was hard to hear.You are first loaded on a bus and travel about a mile when you arrive at a pretty no descriptive location. The trip has close to 500 steps and some narrow passageways that you have to turn sideways to scoot by. There are times you will have duck your head as there are some passageways that are probably 5 feet high (I'm 6 foot). There are parts of the trip where it is wet, so wear shoes that have some traction. As wear a sweatshirt or fleece jacket as it can get cool down in the caves. It felt like it was 60 degrees. The tour last 2 hours, about 1/2 hour was bus travel time to and from the cave entrance to the visitor center.The highlight of the tour comes at the end when you will see the Niagara and Drapery rooms.If you are wonder if you can hack this ""moderate"" .75 mile tour, let me give you some perspective. I am not obese, but not in shape in the least (8-5 desk job and somewhat a couch potato) I was able to do it without much trouble. With such a large number in the tour it was not a fast walk. Going up the stairs and incline paths my breathing was slightly labored but by no means was it marathon or was I ready to pass out. The worst was I had sore calves the next day, but well worth it for what you see at this natural wonder.Tip: For those who have children, ask at the information desk for a kid Ranger booklet.

Mammoth Cave,"Obviously, visiting the longest cave in the world is supposed to be a memorable experience. Well, it's a bit more complicated ...First off, most of the tours are limited and selling out quickly, so the only guaranteed one is a self guided ""discovery"" tour, which is basically a half an hour walk inside a huge cavern. That part of the cave looks almost like subway station construction - it's big, has a lot of lights and cables and some old mining equipment, but the tunnels and the main ""room"" have nearly perfect geometry and very little natural decorations, so it has very ""industrial"" look ... There are a few nice trails in the area, they typically go up and down in the hills through a nice forest to the river ... However, there is a big sign, saying that swimming is not recommended. A local guide told me that the river is heavily polluted by agricultural run off and a lot of the forest is restored on the former farmland, so, just like the cave in self guided tour, it's heavily distorted by humans and doesn't give an impression of the original ""natural"" beauty ...Overall, it's an ok place to visit, but I wish it was better preserved","April 6, 2013",A bit mixed ...,881,"Pleasanton, California",5

I am somewhat claustrophobic and not a big ""fan"" of caves, but was pleasantly surprised of the spaciousness of the cave and the lighting. There are even bathroom facilities and a small restaurant on this tour in the Snowball Room. I do recommend packing a backpack with drinks and snacks as the items are somewhat limited and reading the description of the tour in advance as they offer a wide variety of lengths and difficulty. As a lifelong Kentuckian, I was happy we visited our only National Park in the State. It is advisable to reserve your tour in advance as they often sell out.

We also took the Violet City Lantern Tour which was a 3 mile, 3 hour tour by lantern light in the caves- the longest in the world. The only way to tour inside the cave is with a guided tour. Definitely book your tour ahead of time since many were sold out when we were there and I saw several visitors upset since they were visiting Mammoth Cave and not going to be able to actually see the cave.

It is listed as strenuous but it's not as hard as it sounds. Probably just staying on your feet that long is the most difficult. However they do stop for breaks regularly including a lunch break where you can purchase a sandwich, soup, cookie and drink for $8.50. Personally I'd recommend packing a light lunch and taking with you. A small daypack is easy to manage as you walk through the cave. And I'd take a small flashlight too. They're nice for looking into dark places just off the path. We purchased our tickets for the tour online well ahead of our visit. I'd recommend this as there are always crowds at this park and some of the tours do sell out ahead of time.  Finally don't forget that there are some nice hiking trails on the surface of the park too. I'm sure it's especially beautiful in the fall.

Mammoth Cave,"The Historic Tour is your best bet if you only have time for one tour. It provides a great understanding of the geology, biology, and overall history of the cave - from pre-historic to modern times. This tour shows the cave's magnificence, but without the stalactites and stalagmites featured in some of the other tours. If stalactites and stalagmites are your main priority, I'd suggest some of the other local caves, or numerous ones in Virginia, West Virginia - or Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico. In spite of it's rating, the length, slope, uneven surfaces, and tight squeezes on this tour make it a poor choice for over weight people or those who should avoid long, fairly steep hikes - or delayed attention to a medical emergency.","April 1, 2013",Very interesting and illuminating,66,"Olathe, Kansas",4
Mammoth Cave,"I live in Glasgow, Ky, not too far from Mammoth Cave. When the new visitor's center was opened recently, I was motivated to check it out. Since I am over six and a half feet tall, I don't like to go on cave tours unless I have out of town guests who have never been in the caves. But now that the exhibits are there, it is a real joy to take the time to read and view the displays. They have done a very professional job with the self guided tour through the center. I also like the design of the facilities and evedently so do many others as there were more people there than I have ever seen and yet the crowds were not a problem. After that, my friends and I hiked some of the trails close to the picnic area. The views of the Green river were impressive. When I have more time to hike, I like to cross the Green river in the ferry and hike the back country. There are still some trails that I have yet to explore but will do so soon. I like to there in the late fall until the late spring to get better views and have fewer ticks, which can be an issue in warm weather.","March 31, 2013",Come See The New Visitor's Center!,14,"Glasgow, Kentucky",5
Mammoth Cave,"We took the Historic tour and the New Entrance tour. Both were fantastic! Both tours are rated ""moderate"" but they were easy enough for a wide variety of people in our groups. You may want to call to see what tours will be available when you go. They are not offering as many tours do to cutbacks. This is a must do though. Wait until they turn off the lights and have everyone get quiet! Talk about amazing!","March 31, 2013",Should be a natural wonder!,6,"West Melbourne, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"Greatly enjoyed the New Entrance tour. We reserved our tickets the day before and mostly everything else was sold out, so reserve ahead! We also did the self guided tour, which was worthwhile and a short hike. The groups can be massive, we had almost 100 visitors on ours, but the guides stop and speak to all. Very efficient and organized. Lots of winding stairs and tight squeezes so if your not up for it try a tour rated easy, there are several. The stalagmites in frozen Niagra were beautiful! I got plenty of great pictures with just my iPhone. Avoid the cafe, there were long lines and slow service, but I feel bad for the servers it wasn't their fault, she was attentive with regills and such, so if you go please still tip the servers well! Thanks!","March 30, 2013",Excellent!,5,,5
Mammoth Cave,"When most people think of National Parks, caves typically don't come to mind. Mammoth Cave offers a unique chance to see a part of nature most don't get to experience. They offer a lot of different tours depending on what you're looking for. I've been to Mammoth Cave twice, and done both the New Entrance and Grand Adventure tours. The New Entrance tour is extremely popular and fun. It's great for the lone traveler and families alike. You get a real chance to get a feel for the cave, without having to do anything too crazy. You'll also get to experience ""true darkness"" where your guide will ask everyone to be quiet and turn the lights off. If everyone cooperates, you get to sit in the dark for a few seconds in complete darkness! It's truly an unreal feeling.The Grand Adventure tour is really something special. It's definitely a more physically demanding tour, so if you don't feel up to it I wouldn't recommend it. This tour shines in that fact that you really get to see the cave in a way you wouldn't normally. The smaller group size also makes for a better experience. Although this tour is more physically demanding, it's 100% worth the amazing views.Additionally, all the staff and tour guides were fantastic. Extremely friendly and helpful whenever you had a question or concern. No matter what, you're in for a great time!","March 30, 2013",A Unique Opportunity - Don't Miss Out!,14,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"I was a bit hesitant to go at first, but was persuaded by my bf. I was pleasantly surprised! $12 gets you a two-hour guided tour. Your journey into the ""twilight zone"" as they referred to it was filled with history and humor. You could tell our guide really enjoyed his job and his enthusiasm was contangious. We did the historic tour which took us over 300 feet below the surface. I wouldn't recommend this tour if you have a bad back, neck or knees. There were close to 500 stairs and lots of crouching. The ground you walked on was often rocky and muddy. Wear a comforable pair of gymshoes that you don't mind if they get dirty. You will come out a little dusty! Also, make sure to wear long pants and a jacket or a heavy fleece as the temperatures below drop to a cool 50 degrees. Overall, a great experience for people of all ages! The property also has their own postal office and grocery store. Edmonson County is a dry county, but Mammoth Cave is government owned so they are exempt. Be sure to stock up on liquor at the grocery store. Their prices were cheaper than most liquor stores in Bowling Green!","March 27, 2013",Release your inner spelunker!,26,"Chicago, Illinois",4

Deer and turkey run rampant by the streets and we got some great pics. The cave has numerous choices depending on the level your looking for.

Mammoth Cave,"cross a spider and a cricket, repeat this experiment 30 or 40 times, and stick this critter underground in small enclosed spaces...add a bug hating reviewer for fun and this rating was born.Don't get me wrong...I love caves. I actually drink my morning coffee out of a souvenir cup of Indiana caves...but I was unprepared for the close encounters of the Mammoth kind. At one point on the tour, our guide showed us a pile (a large, large pile) of cave cricket droppings. I felt a sense of panic...I had only seen maybe 30 of them...where was everyone?My son kept asking not to let them fall off the ceiling on him....I explained they weren't spiders, they didn't repel from webs.... but on the inside, I wasn't so sure. They were a distraction from the cave.That being said, our guides were funny and efficient, the welcome center was beautiful, and my son loved completing the Jr. Ranger badge program (available at the information desk).This tour was mostly dry rock with very little formations until the end when we saw ""Frozen Niagara"". Frozen Niagara was pretty amazing. Unfortunately, not amazing enough four our family because we gave away our afternoon tickets for the Snowball Tour.","March 26, 2013",Cave crickets on New Entrance Tour...ewww,74,"Indianapolis, Indiana",3

Our guides were incredible, and this place is just awe inspiring.. This tour is not for those who can't walk long distances, claustrophobic, or anyone with mobility issues. You are rewarded with some incredible views towards the end. Highly recommend having a few days to spend here instead of a few hours as it is so incredible!!","March 24, 2013",Grand Avenue Tour - FANTASTIC!,45,New Albany,5

You cannot have any issues with claustrophobia as you will wriggle, crawl, roll, and climb through some very tight spots.We had an excellent group and terrific guides so our experience was superlative. The guides got us into as many interesting spots for cave activities as they could and we still got to see some of the prettier parts of the cave, too. We saw two bats!Most of the cave isn't that pretty. Don't bring a camera--you aren't going to take many pics. I took one and it wasn't worth having it along (even though a fanny pack was provided) as tons of dirt and dust got in it and now I have to send it to be cleaned.","March 20, 2013",Wild Cave tour was wildly fun,187,Rural Virginian,5

Mammoth Cave,"My wife planned a weekend trip to Glasgow, KY recently. We stayed at a bed and breakfast, then visited Mammoth Cave which was close by.I had heard about Mammoth Cave, but for whatever reason I was just never motivated enough to bother checking it out. I wish I had visited it sooner.The visitor's center is clean, comfortable, and has a great exhibit explaining the features and history of the cave. I didn't know that it is the world's longest cave and it still has areas that are unexplored.We took the two hour Historic Tour. Our guides did a great job of letting us know what to expect. There were going to be some small spaces and low ceilings, but there are electric lights through the whole cave and we would be fine.I won't give away all of the stories and features that you'll experience on the tour, but I will say that if you love history and exploring new places, you need to add Mammoth Cave to your list of places to go. The guides were excellent, I learned a lot, and the two hours flew by.We'll be back to visit Mammoth Cave again very soon.","March 19, 2013",Surprised At How Much I Loved This,3,"Murfreesboro, TN",5
Mammoth Cave,"We did 2 tours on the same day - the Historic Entrance tour and the New Entrance tour. Both are outstanding, but for different reasons. The Historic tour is long - when the description says you'll be walking 2 miles, believe it. This tour really puts the cave's past into context and takes you through a variety of enviroments including wide open rooms and very tight passages. This is a dry part of the cave so don't expect to see great rock formations. The New tour is beyond words - it's the closest you'll get to caving without having to crawl on your belly! The steps down are as important and exhilirating as the actual walk through this part of the cave. Much of this tour is in a dry part of the cave, but ends in the spectacular room with the Frozen Niagara formation and the Drapery Room. Honestly, I can't advise you about which tour to choose if you can only do a single 2-hour tour. They both merit attention and, I think, together give you a strong sense of this natural wonder. If you haven't been to Mammoth, put it on your bucket list folks!","March 15, 2013",The best time you can have underground!,6,"Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, United States",5
Mammoth Cave,"I had a Friday off and wanted to go somewhere that wasn't too far. So I decided to drive up to Mammoth Cave in Kentucky. Flew into Nashville airport and drove about an hour and a half from there to the caves. It is pretty much a straight show from nashville. Witha a small 20 minute excursion from the highway to the caves.There is a greeting center with rangers and a small museums that talks about the history of the caves and what they arenmade of. There is a fee for having a guided tour of the caves and its varies depending on which tour you elect to take. I took the historic tour with a group of about 22 people. I think it was $12 dollars and yes it was well worth it.A normal healthy person should have no problems walking through the cave. But to be frank, one person in our group who has no problems getting into the cave had huge difficulty climbing the tower (a vertical staircase) installed in the mountain, which leads you back out of the cave. So if you have difficulty walking normally and are easily tired this is not for you.The entrance to the cave is a short walk from the ranger center. The opening is huge and you walk down into it and descend a down a path into the darkness. I took no photos because this is not a brightly lit cave. Your eyes take a few seconds getting used to the darkness and you have to focus on not walking into the other guests. I do not remember the names of the different parts. But the first chamber that you get to is huge the ceiling appears to be three stories above your head it's very wide and it's very dark. This is not a place with a lot of stalactites and stalagmites if anything the ceilings kind of flat but the walls are definitely rocky. It is so huge that you actually feel that you are in a cathedral, not a cave. Illumination comes from lights that are activated by the ranger as you move through the cave. No, the lights still do not make the cave very bright, but itndoes allow yountonsee some detail. The next section of the cave was totally different. You went through a path that was so small that you had to watch your head because the ceiling was not much more than five feet, if that much. You squeezed through a section that was so small that you had to walk sideways and take small steps. If the rocks had shifted you would be squished. I loved it, but some had more difficulty getting through it, but we all did. Oh yes, wear a hat, because it will act as a buffer between your head and the ceiling in small places like this. A few folks scraped their heads a little. If you are afraid of small places, then you might want to avoid this tour. The last section had the shape and size of a small movie theater. How they got the benches down into it, I could not imagine. We were told with heavy rains that the river, which is actually flowing at levels deeper in the cave have risen up to this level. This level is 300 feet below the surface.From there it is a relatively fast ascent back to the top. You enter a section with the tower and start climbing about 130 or more stairs. This is where you have to muster all of your strength. It is still dark and it is not a straight vertical, but several twists and turns before you come back to the cathedral like cave. From there you head back up to the entrance and out. You have to rub your feet on special mat at the top of the entrance. To reduce the potential of certain bat fungus being carried from there to other locations. No, it is not a harmful fungus to humans. The tour did not take long. But it was totally amazing to be in that cave. Try it!","March 15, 2013",Just decided to do it! It was really cool!,314,"Atlanta, Georgia",5
Mammoth Cave,"This was my second visit but the first visit for my husband and kids, so we chose the historic two hour tour. The new visitors center is beautiful and includes some interactive displays and a worthwhile video, it is a great place to hang out while waiting for your tour to start. There is a gift shop located in the visitor center but don’t miss the two other gift shops across the bridge by the hotel. There is also a very nice old-school restaurant in the hotel with good food and reasonable prices. There are many historical pictures on display there that are worth checking out too.The whole family enjoyed the tour and enjoyed our Park Ranger/Tour Guide. We went during the first Sunday in March so our group was about 75 people and they said that was the largest group they had all winter. Very enjoyable and hard to describe, it is a must see.","March 14, 2013",Natural Wonder!,199,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"On a whim, we decided to take a weekend trip down to Kentucky and see the Mammoth Caves; I had never been there and had wanted to go for a very long time. We had three younger kids with us (two 11 year olds and an 8 year old) and went on the longest tour without any issues. The guide will give everyone a pre-tour speech and warn anyone who might be too out of shape to take a shorter tour and honestly it almost scared the youngest one out of doing it. They have to do this because once you are down there, its a herculean task to remove someone who may become incapacitated in any way. You do not have to be any sort of athlete; just in reasonable physical shape. You are walking through the caves at a reasonable pace and there is even a long, lunchtime stop in a salt cave where they have somehow installed a little cafeteria and bathrooms! They have many other sorts of tours for more hard-core spelunkers with size requirements due to the physical constraints of the cave, but we took a fairly standard but long tour that you walked through completely upright. This is really a great park, the size of it is awesome and even though we went with younger kids i feel it would be enjoyable for teenagers as well. Warning: there are not a lot of hotel choices nearby; we went with a home rental and were very happy with that. A larger home in this area can rent for less than or similar to the cost of two hotel rooms and you cant compare the comfort levels.","March 14, 2013","Last Second trip, great idea.",39,"Chicago, Illinois",4
Mammoth Cave,"Since it was still considered winter, the cave tours were limited. We ended up doing the historic and new entrance tours though. Both were amazing. Would be a bit better if the groups were smaller, but the caves were awe inspiring.We also did an above ground hike recommended by a ranger in the visitor center. This hike led from the visitor center down to the green river and back up along some bluffs.

Where the ""pretty caves' had the formations lite spotlighted Mammouth Cave only had old graffiti to show off.

Mammoth Cave,"We went to Mammoth Cave over Thanksgiving week-end. Great time to go. Lots of tours but it wasn't crowded. The temps in the cave are constant so it doesn't really matter when you visit. We had to bundle up because it was chilly outside. We stayed in the lodge and took three different tours while visiting Mammoth Cave. The New Entrance tour had really pretty stalagmite and stalactites. The guided tour provided a lot of information about the caves and the history of the area. The next day we took the Gothic Avenue tour. This was the best. We had lamps only - no lights on in the cave. It was like going back in time. Outstanding. If you are not afraid of the dark, try this one out. Then we took the historical tour. It was very interesting. There was one part of the tour that was very narrow. Be careful about this one if you don't like tight places. One thing we learned - no one has yet found the end of this cave.","March 2, 2013",Hard to believe a cave can be this huge,130,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5

Mammoth Cave,"We took this tour because we were crunched on time and have two young children. The cave was pretty cool, but the tour was unimpressive. The guide did not introduce the different rooms we went to well. He said you will pass Crystal Lake before we entered the cave, but half of the people in the tour did not even realize they should look down to see it at when passing the spot (myself included). The guide often spent his time speaking to a few individuals in the front of the group and ignoring the rest of the group. At one point he said watch your step it is slippery. My 5 year old asked him where and his response was ""you'll find out"". That is okay to joke with adults like that, but not sure I thought it was inappropriate for my 5 year old daughter. The tour was short, part of the hour being the bus ride to and fro. Seeing deer along the ride was nice, actually sad to say one of the highlights of the tour. There were a few neat spots along the tour with interesting things to look at and the history of that part of the cave was good. In general though while this is worthwhile if you are just looking to kill a small amount of time, it isn't exactly an awe-inspiring experience and we left a little disappointed.","February 26, 2013",Frozen Niagara Tour,15,"Hudson, Wisconsin",3
Mammoth Cave,"Let me first start by saying the historic cave tour is not for the faint at heart although we had a couple of mid-60's in my immediate group along with a 4 year old and a couple of 8 year olds. I'll say that we made it though the 2 hour guided walking tour because we are all fairly active but if you aren't I wouldn't recommend this tour as there are over 400 steps to retreat the cave. Now on to the fun stuff, we saw a couple of bats on the ceiling, there were ""fat man squeezes"" (our biggest guy is 260 so...), lots of history, opportunities to ask questions, plenty of photo opportunities, they even turn the lights out so you can see just how dark it is inside. Children must be well behaved and accompany an adult the entire tour or they will be escorted out we were told, we didn't have that problem! :) Make sure you dress warm as it's in the 50's year around. Tickets were $12 for adults, $6-8 for kids and the tour guides made it worth it.

Mammoth Cave,"We stopped here on a road trip from Michigan to Florida - Mammoth Cave happened to be on the way. The surrounding area is very, very touristy (there's nothing in the area except the cave, so locals want to cash in on tourists). When you finally arrive, though, the tour is absolutely worth the fee. The tour is great for kids and adults alike, and I'd highly recommend it if you're in the area. I hope to be able to return someday!","February 12, 2013",Touristy for a reason,142,"Pinckney, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"The New Entrance tour was fascinating for the whole family (ages 10-45). You have to take a short bus ride and hike down a short path into the woods to come to the ""new"" cave entrance. There are many narrow steep staircases at the beginning of the ascend into the cave, but the stairs are well encased with railings. The ceiling height at the lowest point is approximately 5ft, but is plenty wide so that no one should feel uncomfortable (you just may have to duck). The tour stops at 3 separate points so that they guides can explain the surroundings. Tours book up very quickly. Strongly recommend making your reservations on-line prior to arrival.","February 5, 2013",New Entrance tour,32,"Rochester, Michigan",5

The tight spaces were about a foot wide only up to your waist and being claustrophobic, it was not a problem for me... No stalactites or mites on this tour though...

We boarded the bus with 59 others and drove about 4 miles to the cave entrance. The guide was very informative, but the fact is that Mammoth is just a hole in the ground. Slightly less boring than lava tubes, but if you're expecting giant rooms full of stalactites and stalagmites, you'll be disappointed.

Mammoth Cave,"we picked this as a quick winter break trip since the caves are the same temp year round (once you are in them) and were not disappointed. the cave does not have as many cave formations as caves that are still forming, but the wonder of this cave is its sheer size! I was amazed at the size and the variety of formations. It also has an incredible history dating back to prehistoric man and before so it will not disappoint history buffs. My first advice is to make advance reservations. The most popular tours sell out before the day of the tour, so buying same day tickets is a challenge as far as selection. we ordered ours in advance online and that strategy was easy and worked well. if you buy in advance, take your printed email confirmation and get in the regular ticket line to check in and get your physical tickets. we started with the frozen Niagra tour. This tour was about an hour...the posted time seems to include bus transport to the entrance. it is a short and easy tour and most of the stairs are optional. that said, the stairs go to one of the most beautiful parts of the tour. This tour had many cool cave formations.we ate onsite at the quick table service at the hotel. it had a limited selection and staff was nice but not overly friendly. I wouldn't seek it out for lunch, but it worked for not leaving the park for lunch.we later took the Historic Tour. this one is 90-120 minutes and I enjoyed both the history and viewing the staggering size of the cave! there are lots of steps on this one if you can't do steps. It includes some incredible ""rooms"". which are neat due to their size and colorations. If you're going into this one only wanting to see stalactites and stalagmites and those types of formations, that isn't what this tour is about. if you want to see a cool, huge cave and learn a lot about its history and some about the geology, this is perfect. (my sons, 6 and 8, did fine on both of these tours)we also enjoyed the museum in the visitor's center, the boys completed the Junior Ranger program, and we will return to try more tours and the outdoor trails!","December 30, 2012",amazing cave. we will be back!,200,"Westfield, Indiana",5

We went for the Historic tour lasting 2 hours and 2.5 miles with medium difficulty. Our tour guide was a very knowledgeable, he had lot of interesting facts to be shared all through the tour and made the tour totally worthwhile. I'd surely want to come back and try one of the 6 hour tours, sometime during falls when the park is more colorful :)","December 10, 2012",Very interesting tours - I'd go back again!!,41,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5
Mammoth Cave,"We checked out the night before and discovered the official ribbon cutting ceremony for the new visitor centre, The next day did the Frozen Niagara and Historic tours.

Mammoth Cave,"We went with our daughter and 5 year old granddaughter right after Thanksgiving and took the Historic Tour. It was very interesting. It's 2 hours long and you walk about 2 miles, but you go slowly so it's not a big deal for those who don't think they can walk very far, but the many steps at the end are require some exertion so those who have heart trouble or can't climb many steps should not do this tour. The ground can also be a bit uneven in places and has some low ceilings that require ducking. Our tour guide was great. I wouldn't mind going back someday and touring another part of the cave. We wanted to spend more time in the visitor's center afterward but didn't have the time.","December 4, 2012",interesting tour,49,"Draper, Virginia",5
Mammoth Cave,"Driving through KY we thought we'd head out to the Mammoth Caves just to check it out. I have to say that I'm glad we did. Our ""Historic Tour"" was led by Jackie, who is very passionate about what he does and it showed with the information he gave our group. One great thing about going outside of the busy season was a smaller group, about 15 people, and was told that during the busier months there would be close to 100-120 people going through these tours with you. However, during those summery, busier months, they offer longer tours that they don't offer in the fall/winter. So with that being said, another trip down to the Mammoth Caves is in the works.","December 4, 2012",One visit is not enough,12,"Flint, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"Straight out of Eaglerider in Nashville, exiting 65 for gas and food in Bowling Green and then north via back roads, we reached Mammoth Cave from the east (great roads northwest of the Cave!). Once here, we decided to book the introductory tour and were we glad we did. True, we did only see 2 miles or so of the 400 miles of passageways, but it was amazing. Exit by the service road going east- it's a bit narrow for cars but perfect on bikes (see my photos). Day 1 from Nashville ended at the highly recommended Comfort Inn and Suites in Cave City with surprisingly good Mexican food at El Mazatlan, a 2 block walk from the hotel.","December 2, 2012","On motorcycle trip, at least a short tour is a must.",58,"La Jolla, California",5

Mammoth Cave,"I just went to Mammoth Cove over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. My husband and I did the ""Historic Tour"" and the ""New Entrance Tour."" Each ticket was $12, which is a bargain considering that you get a guided tour for 2 hrs. The ""Historic Tour"" was exactly that- facts about history. It doesn't show the ""prettier"" parts of the cave, but it does offer some interesting facts about earlier cave tours. The ""New Entrance Tour"" ends with some pretty formations (stalactites & stalagmites). Each tour seemed to have about 100 people. This is a large amount, so I highly recommend being at the front of the tour near the ranger for 2 reasons. First, the ranger sets the pace, which is a comfortable walking speed. If you are near the middle or end, you will literally be running to catch up. Second, you will miss out on alot of fun facts/interesting information if you cannot hear the ranger.The visitor center is just remodeled and celebrating its grand opening on Tuesday. We enjoyed touring the exhibits because we arrived over an hour early for our tour. We were easily able to pass time in the visitor center & listening to a park ranger discuss the role of Mammoth Cave in the Civil War era. We did camp for one night at the camp grounds that had a bathroom facility. The cost was $17 per night for the camp site. The grounds and restrooms were very clean. At the time we went, the sites were available on first come, first serve basis. There was a store in front of the camp grounds where we were able to purchase fire wood.","November 26, 2012",Entertaining Place to Visit,22,"Jackson, TN",4
Mammoth Cave,"Stopping at Mammoth Cave National Park on our way to Florida we discovered that we will have to return and spend a few days. There are miles of bike paths and hiking trails, numerous cave tours, and a hotel and cottages to stay in that will allow you 24 hour access to the beauty of this park. There is no entrance fee for this National Park which is a plus and if you have a senior access pass all the tours are half price. Tour reservations can be made on line which is ideal when planning your schedule. We took the ""historic tour"" which requires two miles of walking and 550 stairs. Don't expect to see any stalagmites or stalagtites on this tour because the cave is limestone and there is no water seepage to form them. The huge underground rooms are impressive and you feel like you are in the movie ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"". Lunch in the Mammoth Hotel after our tour was reasonably priced and tasty.","November 25, 2012",One day is not enough...,67,"Kalamazoo, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I, our daughter who just graduated from college and our sons and their wives spent Thanksgiving weekend in the Mammoth Cave area. We did a lot of hiking in the park and also did the Historic Tour and the New Entramce Tour. Very different from each other but we enjoyed both. Loved the Frozen Niagra area (included in New Entry tour) and would like to go back and take that particular tour...it was not available while we were there. The guides were excellent. I am very thankful that people in the past had the forsesight to preseve this area for future generations.","November 25, 2012",Enjoyed our cave tours,15,"Greeneville, Tennessee",5
Mammoth Cave,"It is a place everyone should go at lest once. There is a lot of history here, it was used by the Indians, The people who fought the revolutionary war, Jesse James, and a TB Hospital, it has been an attraction for a long time and I even found the names of some of my ancestors written in charcoal on the ceiling. This is a great place that is well worth the trip.","November 15, 2012",One place everyone should go at lest once.,46,"ST, Anthony Indiana",5

Mammoth Cave,"I haven't been to the caves since I was a little kid so bringing my 16 year old son was fun. Let me say, he is at the age where not much impresses him, but he did enjoy this. The park offers multiple tours to choose from which go to different parts of the caves and have varying difficulty levels. It is one of the things they cater to very well so do the research on each tour offered before selecting one. We took the 2 hour Historic tour which was about the right amount of time (2 hours) and learning level for my son. My comments will mostly be about this tour in particular since we didn't go on the other tours. The historic tour is a general tour, hitting many of the highlights of the cave system. It is a good tour for adults, and for children middle school age and up since it is the age most of them are learning the science behind the formation of the caves in their schools and it will tie together nicely for them. While you can bring smaller children, I think 2 hours will get too long to keep their interest. There is also a part where they turn out all the lights in the caves which could be scary. There are other tours offered that are better suited to young children.The historic tour is rated moderate on their scales due to the time length, number of stairs, and tighter spaces to get through. This scared me. I am over 50 years old, 5'9"" tall, overweight and out of shape. I am also slightly claustrophobic. I made it through just fine. There were people in even worse shape than me that also did fine so don't let this scare you away. The majority of the cave passages are wide open with good flooring and hand rails. There are parts of the cave that are like huge ballrooms in large castles so there is plenty of room to move around and not feel claustrophobic. This is where the guides do most of their speaking. Then there are wide tunnels which get you from these large rooms to another. My son is 6'2"" and he had to crouch down or duck his head in many places, but still no big deal. Fat Man's misery (a tight curvy passage) was one of the smallest passages, but easy to get through for everyone on the tour and offered a few laughs. Another tight area was a spot where you had to go down some stairs backwards to avoid hitting your head. I took a deep breath on this one due to how scary it looked, but again, no problems. Near the end of the tour, you had to ascend a fire escape type system. I would bet this was the most strenuous for everyone on the tour, no matter how good of shape you thought you were in. The guides did a nice job of moving at a slower pace. There were multiple platforms to stop to take a quick breath and the views from each platform were worth the stop regardless. Ranger Mike led our tour and Ranger Dave brought up the rear. There were probably 100 people in the tour. I thought Ranger Mike's knowledge was incredible and he did a great job explaining things with humor offered throughout his speeches. I read on other people's comments to stay to the front so you could hear what the guide was saying. Other people must have read the same thing and were always trying to rush up to the front, being quite pushy. While the comment to stay in front is partially true, it is not necessary, and being in the back offers some advantages too. My son and I were always within 10 feet of Ranger Mike at the start of the tour. He mostly used the time traveling between rooms to answer individual questions of the most curious visitors. He was not talking and explaining things continuously as I was led to believe reading the other reviews. Ranger Mike's major speeches were in the large rooms of the cave and were very easy to hear. He also took the time to answer everyone's questions, therefore you didn't miss anything if you were not standing next to him to do it individually. What you did miss was the occasional pass of his flashlight highlighting gypsum or some candle soot, but the path lights in the cave highlight the same things. You just need to look wherever you see a spotlight. What you get by being in the back of the tour group is the ability to take your time viewing things and get some pictures without people making you feel like you need to keep moving. It is a more relaxed pace and visit. Ranger Dave is at the back and will not let you get lost. We toured the visitor center at the end of the tour. I am not a fan of visitor centers but this one is very nicely done, interesting and hands on. It offered explanations of everything we just saw or heard about so it complemented the tour nicely.Other things I wish I knew: You walk as a group on paths to the opening of the cave. You are not bussed there.You can bring a water bottle with you.There are no bathroom stops. The caves are at a constant temperature of 54 degrees. This sounds cold, but without wind and such, is fairly nice. People that wore coats were carrying them half way through the trip. A light jacket or sweatshirt is more than enough. I had a long sleeve tshirt and vest and was sweating at times!I recommend you bring your own flashlight to check out the areas of the cave that are harder to see.I recommend you leave purses and backpacks at home. They are just bulky with no purpose.My favorite part was when they turned off all the lights in the cave. Sooo Cool! It really makes you think and thank the people that explored these places 200 years ago. The National Parks really have done a nice job with the tours they offer here. Kudos to our tax dollars being well spent!","November 13, 2012",Nice park with tours of the caves for every level,137,"Columbus, Ohio",5

Mammoth Cave,"We went over fall break and ordered our tickets over the phone ahead of time. Good thing we did as most tours were sold out. We took the New Entrance Tour and Historic Tours. Tours were $12/adult, $8/kid.Both tours were about 2 hours each. The New Entrance tour has you take a short bus ride to the entrance. Lots of narrow stairs, but not too strenuous. The kids loved it! The rangers leading the tours were both excellent, mixing information with humor. The Historic tour really gives you a sense of just how mammoth the cave really is. The tour held the kids' (8 and 10) attention the entire time and not one complaint about walking or climbing stairs. They especially liked Fat and Tall Man's misery and going through the more narrow sections of the cave. Mammoth Cave is a national park you don't want to miss!","November 7, 2012",Mammoth is no exaggeration!,113,"Fishers, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"OK.. this is National Park #29 for us in our quest to see them all before we can't get around. Why we have driven past this one so many times and never stopped has me stumped. I think it is because we have been to other major cave systems and figured ""seen one, seen 'em all."" Couldn't be more wrong on that - this place is freakin' amazing. The ranger who guided our tour (the ""Classic"" tour) was great at his job and added a lot to the experience. We will absolutely go back to see other sections of the cave system - the historical uses and details are fascinating. One surprise is that the Annual NP Pass which we have did NOT cover the cost of the tour. Finally, when the ranger goes over the physical demands of the tour - trust that there is no exaggeration and if you don't feel up to it, choose a different tour. Your fellow visitors will appreciate it :-)","November 7, 2012",Unexpectedly Awesome,77,"Franklin, Tennessee",5

Mammoth Cave,"Went on a Tuesday. Not crowded at all. Chose the historical tour. $12 adult. 2 hours long. Not real small places except fat mans misery. Lots of steps uphill so be prepared. On this tour you do not see the cave formations known as stalagmites & stalactites. You do see gypsum, old trees hollowed out to run water thru for the saltpeter process. Nicely guided tour. Don't forget the new museum with interactive displays. The visitor center is new and beautiful. Tip: if you go during summer months or busy times go get your tickets early as the tours do sell out. They had over 400,000 visitors to the park last year. Don't forget to see the mammoth cave railroad cars on your way into or out of the park. This use to be the way in before cars. If you get hungry after the tour and don't want to eat @ the hotel, go about 10 miles to pig,ky and eat @ the porky pig diner. Very tasty BBQ. Country cooking @ reasonable prices.","November 7, 2012",Great place for first time cavers.,278,bluegrass state,5
Mammoth Cave,"A variety of tours are available depending upon your time, fitness, etc. The park has been there a long time and everything is routine, well-designed, interesting and kept up. We really enjoyed out ranger/guide and the display at the center.

Mammoth Cave,"Be sure to reserve your tour spot early as the popular ones sell out. There are several to choose from and I wish we could have gotten in one with more open spaces. We took the one 1 hr. 15 minute tour that was reviewed as an easy walking (some fairly slanty ramps though) tour for people who didn't like tight spaces. There were some areas that we had to duck down to pass through and while they wouldn't qualify as tight they were narrow. When the guide turned the lights off in one of the more open spots so we could experience total darkness for a few minutes I realized just how much I didn't like caves! Glad we went, however, no more caves for me.FYI: The visitors' center doesn't sell posters or prints of the cave. Get them at the hotel gift shop.","November 3, 2012",Amazing but claustrophobic,43,WHEATON,4
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Caves is a very interesting NP with all it's various tours within the cave system. Although there is no admission to enter the park, you have to purchase a ticket for each tour, per person which adds up very quickly. My wife and I went on two tours, the ""New Entrance tour"" and the ""Histroric Tour"", and the combined cost of just those two tours for just the two of us was $48.00. If one were to come with their family and do multiple tours the price would be astronomical. This differs greatly from most other NP's which charge per vehicle, only one time for an entire week, all-inclusive.They have a beautiful, new visitors center with post and beam ""shelters"" for the tours to meet under. It didn't take me long to figure out where the money came from to pay for the new center! $7,000,000 worth, in fact.The cave tours are interesting and some quite lenghty, although a significiant amount of time is spent by the rangers repeatedly explaining the rules and cautionary warnings before entering.The caves are very dimly lit, so don't bother taking your camera. Also another tip, if you want the full experience of the tour, stick close to the ranger in the front. We quickly found out that the large group we were in got spread out and the ranger does not wait for the whole group to arrive at each stopping point to give his talks. If you don't stay in the front you will hear nothing that the ranger has to say!Above ground the park does not have a whole lot to offer. No scenic byways or spectacular views. There was a bike path which is probably good for the campers.In the grand scheme of the National Parks, Mammoth Cave is a one-trick pony, and an expensive on at that. I really couldn't see spending more than a day or two here, (unless you are a cave fanatic).The closest town for accomodations is Cave City, which has nothing to offer other than chain hotels and a couple of restaurants. You can't even buy a six-pack of beer at the store! ""Downtown"" Cave city was a ghost town after dark on our visit.","October 31, 2012",Fun but very expensive,15,NH,3

As this was her first visit to Mammoth Cave (and my first in at least 20 years) we took the classic Historic Tour. It was 2 miles and took 2 hours with with well-spaced stops for history lessons from the park ranger.

Waiting around wasnt fun because we knew the rest of the day would be screwed up with our schedule but.. we waited. I had decided on the new entrance tour bcause to me it sounded like there would be more to see. We got on the bus at 10 to take us up to the cave and the guide was very informative. He could answer all the questions asked of him. The tour took 2 hrs and the time flew by. The cave is a consgtant temp so it was comfortable. I wore a light jacket. The people there were very nice and friendly. Helpful. There is a small gift shop to look at books and other small items while you wait for your tour to start. there si also free wi fi should you need it. by the way. there are alot of steps.. 500 in our tour and also narrow passageways. they werent too bad since my husband who is 6'2 and250 lbs could fit through,"October 22, 2012","fun, excellent tour",98,"Baltimore, Maryland",5

Mammoth Cave,"We took the New Entrance Tour. This was our first trip to Mammoth Cave. Since this was our first visit, we should have taken the Historical Tour. This tour was very interesting and somewhat strenuous. LOTS of steps. The tour groups are huge and this causes problems. Common courtesy is dead and buried in this country, and this fact really affects your experience on this tour. We got seperated from the tour guide a couple times due to people stopping to do their own thing with no regard for those behind them. So, when you get to a presentation area the guide is halfway finished talking before everyone gets there. Between this and the screaming babies and misbehaving kids and it becomes somewhat stressful. The guide specifically asked everyone to not activate their phones during a blackout demonstration. Did everyone comply with his wishes? Not a chance. We ate lunch in the onsite restaurant.

Mammoth Cave,"I traveled through right after Labor Day in early Sept. Campground was pretty much deserted. Did not do the tour but the Rangers told me of another smaller primitive site for tents (no electric or fresh water) next to Green River. Envelopes and a lock box for a $12 camp fee. (honor system). The only person there was a ferryman who took people across the river in a rustic sidepaddle ferryboat. He left at 6pm and I had the place to myself. I took my kayak out on the river for a few miles. Easy travel, quiet and serene. Wild turkey, deer, turtles with a whole lot of peace and quiet. By the time I got back to my campsite I felt ""part"" of my surroundings rather than a visitor. A ranger stopped by late and we talked for a while but once he left, it was me and the forrest. I had settled into a mood of tranquility and comtemplated that feeling we sadly lost through technology and modern living. If you are a tenter, ya gotta try it. Nice facilities in the main campground for people with campers but I'd advise you to call and make reservations.

I had hoped to see some bats or something, but you really won't see any there. There was a lot of people on the tour, but this did not really make it hard to hear or anything. It was a very easy walk and stair climb (not that bad at all) and it is recommended. I would like to try another one in the summer months (River Styx). For the price it was pretty affordable to take this tour.","September 30, 2012",Mammoth Cave Historic Tour,86,"Indianapolis, Indiana",4
Mammoth Cave,Wow what an attraction this is. Well worth taking the Historic Tour to learn more about the longest underground caves in the world.

Mammoth Cave,"We knew we might not arrive on time from Lexington, KY, but we made it in time for the 3pm Historic Tour. In late September on a Friday afternoon, we did not need a reservation. We were lucky. The tour guide was great, and the cave experience is one of the best in the country. We have seen plenty of cave formations in other caves, so we preferred the historic tour which concentrates on the hugeness of the cavern. The narrow passages and low-ceiling in some places made for a fun hike through the cave. I also recommend the trails connecting to the visitor center and historic cave entrance area.","September 26, 2012","Late September, got a tour without a reservation",297,,5
Mammoth Cave,"I wanted to show my grandaughter one of Americas wonders during a trip to the midwest. On the way was Mammoth Cave Park. I have been going to this park from the time I was pre teen and that was in the 1950s. I have seen a lot change as time passed. But the main item, the cave still remains the best part. We took a light tour of four hours and viewed some of the History of the cave and heard stories and History from a very special guide. Our Guide was a direct decendent of the three original guides from over a hundred years ago. On our tour we viewed the large passages and areas where products used to make gun powder were mined. We also did some twisty cruves and climbing that was hard at times. But we survived and had a great time. Staying at the Park has many levels. In the past I have stayed in cabins that were very low end in price, and once in the big lodge that was high end on price. My favarite was the old Hotel now torn down. Food options are good with a reasonable priced full service resturant to a modern snak bar service. The full sevice resturant has a good but basic menu and is based on country family type foods. All very good and filling. Little stores abound to see any type of Tenn or cave rememberance there is. This is a more than one day and less than two day for a quick visit but my recomedation is to stay for three nights. That was one can enjoy a day under and a day over on a trail or river visit. They have a web site for information and it can be helpful but if you travel like me, it will serve only as a guide. If your going to stay in park you MUST secure the room, if not you will pay $$. The entire staff down to the kitchen staff have a very friendly attitude and seem to be sure to make the visit a good one. In my youth i used to do ""wild"" caving or spelunking as it is called. You can do some wilder caving here but need to be in much better shape than I am now. Go, enjoy, and experence wild America.","September 26, 2012",Underground wonderment,53,"Thonotosassa, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"My husband had never been to the park. Since we are in off season, the variety of tours offered during the week are limited. Took the Historic Tour which is 2 hours and 2 miles. There are over 400 stairs on this tour and some very tight spaces so it is rated moderately difficult. The group was small so we were treated to a lot of extra stories. The tour guide was very cheerful and very thorough in answering everyone's questions.Everything is very well kept and clean. Saw many deer and wild turkeys in the park.","September 25, 2012",Great Tour,46,"Mount Juliet, Tennessee",5
Mammoth Cave,"My family camped in the park campground for 2 nights over Labor Day weekend. My husband took the challenging Wild Cave tour, and says it is DEFINITELY NOT for everybody - it is HIGHLY physically challenging. I took the River Styx tour with my 9-year old daughter, and with the exception of getting tired on the stair climb out, we had no problems. It was 2-1/2 hrs of walking & stairs, but nothing we couldn't handle - and I am NOT in great shape. I was told that some areas of the cave are accessible, but I did not take the self-guided tour, so no review.We saw deer adn wild turkey just outside the campground. The site itself (#10) was clean and well tended, close to the bathroom, and plenty large enough. Parking is right at your site. The rangers made several drive-throughs to check on campers. There are snakes in the area, but we saw none, and the campground has an info board near the bathroom with pictures of the dangerous ones and short blurbs on avoiding them.The rangers and guides were all very friendly, and numerous - there was never an instance of hunting for someone to help. They gave my daughter a Junior Ranger activity book to fill out, which let her earn a badge and learn about the park; this is available in many National Parks and the kids can collect badges.The only complaint I have is about the campground showers; they are at the little shop a short walk away, and you have to pay for it - $2 for 10 mins - and they're only available until 10pm. You can buy firewood or use any downed, dead wood; we had plenty of downed wood to use. I will definitely be going back.","September 24, 2012",Excellent family camping weekend,24,"Atlanta, Georgia",4

Mammoth Cave,"We arrived on Monday and before we left for vacation, we had gone to their website and decided which cave tour we wanted to take. They are divided into catagories that have descriptions such as...easy, strenous, very strenous, etc. When we arrived, we checked the board to make sure the tour we wanted was available. It was listed so we proceeded to the ticket line. We waited in line for tickets no more than 10 minutes which is definitely a plus. (But I should mention here that it was raining so maybe that's why there weren't too many people there.) When it was our turn and we told the cashier which tour we wanted, she informed us that the signage was wrong and that tour was not offered during the week. We picked that particular tour because it was only going to take an hour and 15 minutes and also because it was described as ""easy"". Our choice when she told us the tour we wanted was not available was take another one or leave. We chose to leave because we had other places we wanted to see that day so it was a waste of time for us to go there, but I'm sure had the tour we requested been available, it would have been nice judging by what we saw on the website.","September 22, 2012",disappointing...,25,"Fayetteville, Pennsylvania",2
Mammoth Cave,"We decided last minute to take the kids to mammoth cave (we live in Michigan)..the drive wasnt too bad, we ended up in town late afternoon. As far as the tours for mammoth cave, most of them start fairly early and go into early afternoon, so we decided to go horseback riding the first day. After that we drove to the national park to get the kids excited about the tour we were going to take the following day, good thing we did because we ended up buying the tickets for our tour while we were there. The next day they were all sold out! That would have been a huge dissapointment. It started to rain a little, but we dressed appropriatly. Even though it was hot and humid in KY, we broke jackets and wore long pants for the tour. The caves are chilly and in combination with the rain, some of the other tourists were pretty wet and cold in the caves!! We took the historic tour which is a two hour tour and the kids LOVED it!! It definetly did not feel like two hours, it went by so quick! There are tight spots and deep spots, so if your claustrophobic or afraid of heights I might reconsider this tour...Good luck and enjoy your trip!","September 19, 2012",Great Family getaway,6,"Battle Creek, Michigan",5

Mammoth Cave,"We opted for the Frozen Niagara tour because we weren't sure what to expect. The tour leaves from the visitor's center and you take about a 10 minute bus ride (which was a souped up school bus, kind of like a prison bus) to the tour entrance. To enter the cave at this point you have to go through a revolving door, and the first minute or so is a low ceiling and not very well lit. A man in front of me hit his head on the rock twice, once it bled a bit. The park ranger assigned to our tour (Kenetha? Something like that.) was very friendly and energetic. We did take the extra steps down to the see the Drapery room - if you can navigate the steps (they weren't bad: I'm not in terrific shape and was able to get down and back up carrying a frightened six year old boy!), definitely check it out.Overall the tour was nice. The ranger said it's the most 'pretty' tour of the cave you can go on, and the shortest. However, the tour itself is only about 40 minutes at best. It's quite short. You go down a bit, the ranger speaks to you, you turn around and come back out the same way. There was no waiting time for the bus to pick us up, which was nice.","September 14, 2012",Frozen Niagara tour,67,"Newburgh, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,Mammoth Cave has many miles that you can hike. The tours very from an hour to 6 hours. The tours are from easy to very strenuous. We took the two hour historic tour which is listed as moderate. The most difficult part of this tour is the steps at the end and the hill from the cave to the visitors center. You can take your time on the hill so it's not to bad. Very interesting tour. This cave was caused by the flow of a river. Early settlers mined minerals from the cave.,"September 13, 2012",Great Cave experience,111,"Burleson, Texas",5
Mammoth Cave,"For anyone who loves caves or nature, this is the queen of them all. There is so much history to this enormous cave. I recommend the Historical Tour for a discussion on the old saltpeter mines from the War of 1812, the role of slavery in the cave, and the tuberculosis sanitoriums. The New Entrance Tour provides an incredible perspective of the cave, and culminates in a section called Frozen Niagara, where beautiful cave formations can be seen. Note that this section is also a separate, shorter tour for those who do not wish to do the many steps and the two hour hikes for each of the New Entrance and Historical Tours.","September 7, 2012",Not to be missed!,5,Whitehouse Station,5
Mammoth Cave,"I had passed the signs to this National Park many times on road trips and made a point to stop this past summer. We were so glad we did. The park is so well organized and they have to be. There are over 350 miles of caves! We took the 2 hour historical tour and thoroughly enjoyed it. Two tour guides took us through 2 miles of cave and we saw stunning caverns, long low-lit passageways with fallen boulders, odd little crevices that we had to climb down into and shimmy through, and deep, dark holes with ""waterfalls"" that rose back up to the surface. Practically anyone could do this tour. An older woman in her seventies was in front of us and she struggled a little with the area that we had to duck down to pass through but otherwise she was fine. We were astonished by the darkness and with the way the cave just kept opening up to more and more fascinating scenery. There are many tours to take and many above ground trails to hike as well. Don't pass this unique experience by.","September 7, 2012",Unique natural gem!,14,"New Orleans, Louisiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave has a lot to offer. In addition to the various tours there are also some nice walking/hiking trails. We walked a couple of the trails while we waited for our tour to start. The Histour Tour was about 2 hours and allowed us to experience many parts of the cave that the early tourists would have visited. Fat Man's Misery was an interesting section- not for those who are very large. The stairs were very doable and although it's listed as a moderate tour it wasn't very strenuous. Even if you visit in the summer, bring a jacket or sweatshirt and possibly jeans because it is very cool in the cave.

We stayed at the Mammoth Cave Hotel, which was a little over priced for the dated and musty-smelling rooms, but it is a state park ""resort"" so you can only expect so much. The short walk from the room to the visitors center can't be beat. We took the Historic and Focus on Frozen Niagara cave tours and really enjoyed both of them. The tour guides were very skilled, interesting and knowledgeable and the caves themselves were stunning. The Focus on Frozen Niagara allow so extra time in the caves for pictures, which is great if you are into that sort of thing as there is not much time or room on the other tours. We felt the tours were a good value for the price of entrance as well.","September 4, 2012",Cave Tours Were Great!,16,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5

It was a great tour, it goes deeper into the cave than any of the other tours and you get to see the river that carved the cave. It was listed as a ""moderate"" tour but it wasn't too strenuous. The most intense part was the staircase back up toward the end of the tour but even that wasn't too bad. Along the tour our guide told us about the natural history of the cave, which differs from some of the other tours which tell you about the human history of the cave.

It is truly mammoth and just so impressive. The rotunda room is massive and you see where the slaves dug out nitrate for gun powder. The original site has never been altered and the wood has been preserved for over 200 years. The ranger was very knowledgeable.

Mammoth Cave,"We have done a number of cave trips before and have been to Mammoth Cave so we wanted to try something different. The Lantern Tour looked like fun and something unique. It is considered moderately strenuous. We had 3 children (10,8,6) and my parents (70+ in decent shape/health). The tour was unique and interesting, but one thing we learned is, on this tour, you don't really see many formations, it's all about seeing it the way the original people would have seen it. It's a lengthy tour so we were a little disappointed to not see at least some of the neat formations in the caves. Only other comment - the walk in is slow, the walk out is fast - if you need to walk slower, you need to be at the front with the ranger so he/she slows the pace down. Plus, the VERY steep climb once outside the caves at the end is a killer - and it's in the dark!","August 28, 2012",Lantern Tour at Mammoth Cave,4,"Wooster, Ohio",4

We did two tours - one of the New Cave entrance which was originally in private hands, and the Historic tour which is where the exploration of Mammoth Cave began. The tour guides were excellent and gave us a real appreciation of what it must have been like to be among the earliest humans to explore and discover the cave system. We learned of the history of the caves as a source of saltpeter for gunpowder, and it's history as a destination for tourism. Both tours were of moderate difficulty, requiring walking for 1-2 miles. Children seemed to enjoy the tours. Late August the crowds were light and we had our pick of times for the tours.

There is an area called Fat Man's Misery that we were warned about at the beginning of the tour; it was no big deal, so don't let that deter you from this tour. We visited in early August. I brought a long sleeve shirt into the cave but did not wear it over shorts and a t-shirt. If you only have time for one tour, I would take the New Entrance Tour over this one as it has more of the scenic cave features. I believe each tour was $12/adults and $8/child. We also ate at the sit-down restaurant across from the visitor's center. The food was good and reasonably priced.

Mammoth Cave,"After reading multiple reviews on here I decided to start with the intro. to caving tour. Reading about some of the aspects of the Wild Cave Tour, though this is the tour I really wanted to go on, I was worried what if I didn't like it, or it was too difficult and I would be stuck doing something I disliked for 6 or so hours. So I decided to try the Intro. tour to see how that went and decide whether to take the Wild Cave Tour based upon this experience. Basically, what I found is that the Intro. to caving tour was okay, but much too easy. If you are athletic at all or somewhat fit and torn between the two go for the Wild Cave Tour. We didn't even get muddy at all until we hit a puddle at the end of the tour.The Keyhole in the Intro. to Caving tour was super easy and did not rely only on upper body strength like many say, you can use a knee to get yourself through and it wasn't all that tight, so if you are worried about the Intro. to Caving tour, it is really not all that difficult. The Keyhole was the most difficult though no one had a problem at all with it, not even overweight individuals that were on the tour (though I know they will send some away if they are too large). I am a little claustrophobic, 115 lb, 5 foot 3 female and I was fine the entire way and we had a 10 year old on our tour who did very well.","August 19, 2012",Intro. to Caving Versus Wild Cave Tour,6,"Madison, Connecticut",5

We did the historic and snowball tours. Historic was very interesting. There is 1 area where there are tight spaces. I did fine with it. The snowball is fairly easy to do. Glad we came.

Mammoth Cave,"Its a cave... a big one... apparently the biggest. However, you quite obviously dont see all of it (or anything like all of it) and what you do see tends to lack the ""pretty stuff"" like stalactites and stalagmites as its a dry cave. There are some tours that do have these elements, but not all and they are not as awe inspiring as other caves I've been in. What you do see (Historic Tour) is a very large cave which is explained well by the rangers and you get to experience a little of what caving is all about through a slight tight area, a bit of ducking and a time in darkness. I enjoyed it, but I think the talking went on a bit much for me. I'd have liked to have just appreciated the cave itself. Another point is that the Historic Tour can have 120 people on it. We had about 20-30 which felt ideal. I think I'd have been fed up with 120 people on it. As it was, some people were constantly on their cameras flashing and blinding us.Its worth noting something I didnt know, which is that at one point you have to walk up a pretty high tower (probably 100' up). I'm scared of heights and I seriously didnt like this bit at all, as the stairs were shaking under the weight of people. I used to be a potholer myself, so there was nothing on this tour that phased me in the least. The squeeze and the ducks were all simple, but there was a guy ahead of us who struggled to squeeze through the gap. He was a big guy though. So, its well worth the visit. Book online and book early. The best tours are booked up well in advance. Wear something warm as it gets cold down there and you are stood around listening to the ranger at times. There is no bathroom on the Historic Tour which is about 2 hours long. Some people really struggled with their fitness on the stairs. No disabled access obviously. Wear sensible shoes, its slippery in places. PS the county its in is a dry county. You can get beer in the ""outdoor"" store as you approach the visitors centre. Lots of people appeared to be doing this.","August 17, 2012",What to say?,64,"York, United Kingdom",4
Mammoth Cave,"The Mammoth Passage Tour doesn't require a reservation and is only $5, so we went on that one. Our ranger was friendly and informative, telling us a lot about saltpeter mining and slavery and Native American artifacts. The hike to the cave (1/4 mile down a relatively steep slope and then 80 steps, reverse on the way back) wasn't as bad as it sounds, although we agreed that we'd have to spend a night if we were going to do more than one tour.","August 16, 2012",Mammoth Passage Tour,40,"Berkeley, California",5
Mammoth Cave,"We went on teh River Styx Tour and had a great time. We went through Fat Man's misery, and traveled all the way to the bottom of the cave to see the River Styx. The River itself isn't too impressive, but the journey to the river was the highlight. We were hoping to see Cave Fish which have no eyes, but none were spotted. It was fascinating to learn about the cave. Our guides were very knowledgeable and helpful. I think the rating of moderate is fair. If someone has mobility issues it could be difficult, but for most people they shouldn't have much problems. I took my wife and 2 kids 12-10 and they loved it. I will say we had 1 kid in our group who felt a bit claustrophobic and didn't care for the dim lights. However, this cave is the most wide open cave, and I had no feelings of claustrophobia. Fat man's misery is a bit tight, but I think it would be more difficult for tall people (6'4+). The ceiling is low for about 30 yards so you have to walk hunched over, but the path was wider than I anticipated. You would have to be quite round to have issues. You just have to turn to the side. Overall would Recommend","August 15, 2012",River Styx Tour was great,11,"Rogers, MN",5
Mammoth Cave,"We took several cave tours, all priced well and well guided. We began with the New Entrance Tour, which I would highly recommend. It was beautiful! If you like stalactites and stalagmites you will love the Frozen Niagara. Keep in mind this tour has some tight places, tall places, and over 500 stairs. Most of the stairs are down. When you get to the Frozen Niagara there is an optional room you can visit. It is an additional 98 stairs (1/2 down and the other 1/2 up) but it is well worth it. There are amazing and breathtaking formations! We also did a self-guided tour of the Historical Entrance to the cave. It was completely different than the caves you see in the New Entrance. All of the guides are very knowledgeable and are their for your questions. It would take several days to see all of the tours so plan accordingly, wear good shoes, I would NOT suggest flip-flops even though I saw a lot of people wearing them.

This tour is an easy trip - regardless of what the official park guide says, anyone that can travel down steps ( and there are a lot) can take this tour.

The River Styx tour is only offered once a day and for a few weeks of the year, so it was sold out by the time we arrived at 8:00 am for our 8:30 tour. The ranger, Sue was very knowledgeable. She decribed this as the only tour that goes from top to bottom. This is a 2 1/2 hour hike that covers the Historic Tour route plus addiitonal river and lake a further 50 feet down. You can feel the cool air (54F or 12C) as you arrive at the natural entrance. Fat Man's Misery is a really neat part of the hike as are a few passgaes where youhave to crouch or climb down narrow stairs. We saw bats, learned about cave life and felt water drip on us. You do not need to be in exceptional physical condition, but you do need to be able to walk at a good pace and fit into smaller spaces. When we came out, the hot air (90F+ or 32C+) really hit us and fogge d up our glasses. Unlike another cave we were in, we were allowed to take pictures. A wonderful experience!","August 10, 2012",Impressive - River Styx Tour,49,"Southern Ontario, Canada",5
Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I are from Ohio and have walked the Ohio Caverns and wanted to do something a little different and bigger. We planned our trip to visit Mammoth cave and started reading about what to do, which tours to go on and it all was a little overwhelming at first. So we decided to do the Frozen Niagra tour on Sat. evening around 7pm CENTRAL time...The Frozen Niagra tour is where 98% of their formations are located, we were so happy we decided to go on that tour first. It's not very long and its seperate from everything else. You meet with the guides in your own car and drive back through the park to get to the entrance. They walk you into the main part and talk a little history then they let you walk freely to take as many pictures as you want. It's very neat and amazing to see all the formations in this one area ! It's a MUST do if you are there to see formations !! The next day we had reservations for the Historic tour at 11:15 with Steve Kistler (great tour guide) very knowledgeable and funny at the same time ! This tour is a little strenenous. You don't realize it on the way down that you will have to come all the way back up the ramp ! It is a bit chilly when you go in the cave so take a light jacket or sweatshirt. Pictures are just about worthless in this part. Either too dark, too far away, too big, etc...No formations but alot of neat historical things to look at ! Now, the part called ""Fat Man's Misery"" worried my husband to no end as he is 6'2'' and about 300lbs... HE MADE IT JUST FINE....I personally think its harder for women because the narrow part is around the hips and our hips are wider than theirs. It is a squeeze for just about anyone but not for very long...towards the end you get to climb alot of stairs to get out. The group your in is so big that its slow going up the stairs so it gives everyone a chance to catch their breath ! Once out of the cave back up that long ramp...this I think was the worst part. All around it was a great time ! A lot of wild life roaming around on your drive into the park. We already want to come back and do other tours ! Couple tips:1. Get info off line about the tours and make your reservations ahead of time !2. Bowling green is only about 30min straight south and they have way more places to eat and stay and it's cheaper3.Don't waste your time driving to Glascow...not much thereHope my review helps someone !! Have a great day !","August 10, 2012",Great little vacation !,5,"Pleasant Hill, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"This is one of the largest caves in the world. Much of it was explored by a slave named Stephen Bishop. It was used during the Civil War to produce gunpower. This is a must see in Kentucky. If you have out of town guests this is only a few hours drive and there are more than five different excursions to take including one on the underground river. Blind fish, albino crickets, both Fat Man's Misery and Tall Man's Misery make this a wonderful experience for all ages. You need to be able to walk for a couple of hours but it is a cool 65 degrees in the cave year round. As a native Kentuckian I have been to this cave many times and each time I learn something new. I plan to go again and again.","August 10, 2012",One of the Eight Wonders of the World in Kentucky,81,"Louisville, Kentucky",5
Mammoth Cave,"We had a very outgoing guide through the New Entrance. He was very knowledgeable and entertaining. I do have to say though, if you've seen one cave, you've seen them all.

Mammoth Cave,"By now you probably know that this is the longest cave system in the world, with 350+ miles of explored cave. My husband visited as a kid with his family and insisted that we needed to travel all the way from Florida to Mammoth Cave. We took the Grand Avenue Tour (reserved 24 hours in advance) and the Historic Tour (reserved on site), together over 6 miles of walking, without overlapping and actually quite different from one another. During the Grand Avenue Tour, we stopped for a very nice lunch in the Snowball Room, INSIDE the cave. There also were a couple restroom stops during this tour, while not in the Historic. Michael was our guide in the Grand Avenue tour and he was very fun and pleasant. For people with decent stamina and no mobility problems, any of these two tours would be OK. . Allow all day to visit Mammoth Cave, it's a unique experience and if you chose your tours carefully you will be able to see very different features on each one.","August 7, 2012",Memorable,25,,5

Mammoth Cave,"I first visited Mammoth Cave about 12 years ago with my grandparents and sisters and remembered all these years the Historical Cave tour. I've always wanted to take my daughter so since we were in the area we went on the tour. Our cave guides were very professional, funny and informative. They gave alot of information I never heard before but left our some stories I remember from the time before. I'm sure each tour guide does it differently. We had a full/sold out tour group so there were a few times we had to wait for everyone to catch up but it was fun to listen to the kids getting excited and families enjoying their views. People of all sizes were on this tour, but we did have to squeeze through Fat Man's Misery (I'm 130pds.) so no problem for me. We also went through Tall Man's Misery (I'm 5'3) so again no problem. There were shorter spots however that I did have to limbo through. It was fun and I would definetely go on it again. The huge rooms are beautiful. Oh, this is a 2 mile/2 hour tour, 54 degrees, so if you are sensitive to cold then bring a sweater.","August 3, 2012",Worth every minute!,26,oklahoma,5
Mammoth Cave,"What a unique experience and way to beat the summer heat. We went on the sold out Historical Tour with 120 people. The tour lasted two hours and covered two miles. Our guide was fantastic. He's been touring for 20 years, so very knowledgable and adept at handling a large crowd. My six year old niece and 64 year mom was with us. You definitely need to be very mobile to do this tour. There's some moderate crouching involved. The cave is dry, so there's no stalagmites on this particular tour. The history of the cave exploration was fascinating and some of the views were jaw dropping. The above ground facilities were very clean and modern and tours left very promptly. We rented a 50 cent locker to store my purse in, plus store my summer clothes. I changed into jeans and a hoodie, but my teenage boys were fine in T shirts and shorts.

Mammoth Cave,I've passed the signs driving down the interstate for many years. Wish I had visited sooner! The park is beautiful with wildlife such as deer and wild turkeys in abundance grazing on the side of the road. The cave tours are outstanding and humbling. I had no idea how extensive the cave system is nor did I have any idea of the commercial uses over the years. Best for families with children over 8 or so as there is quite a bit of walking. Some tours require reservations but you can show up and go on some of the basic tours without. The Lantern Tour is a park favorite. I recommend closed toed athletic shoes and bring a sweatshirt. Going from the heat outside to the 50 degree cavern temperatures will cool you off in a hurry.,"August 2, 2012",A Kentucky Jewel,10,"West Palm Beach, Florida",4
Mammoth Cave,"This was our first time to Mammoth Caves and it was a hit. We went on the Historic Trail Tour. There were lots of cool views. There are a lot of chances to take pictures. The tour was a great learning lesson for adults and kids (9 and 11 yrs) that included a bit of history (War of 1812) and how caves are formed. One cool experience was getting to see how dark the caves were for the original explorers. Only negative was that the tour size was too big (120 people). People talked, kids too young to listen cried, and it was a bit distracting. Caves were cool, but we did not need jackets and wore shorts. Definitely worth the time and money. As others have noted, this is a dry cave and this tour is pretty consistent in scenery. Other tours might offer more. We knew that going in and were not disappointed. Reservations are probably a good idea.","August 1, 2012",big excellence,15,"Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin",4

Mammoth Cave,"This was our reason for visiting Kentucky. When I first walked down to the cave, I was completely surprised by the emense size. As we started walking along, I was just amazed with the power of water. This isn't a cave with all the great formations of the usual caverns, but that's not what's great about these caves. We did the historic tour and I was worried because of the size of the tour, but it wasn't a problem at all. If you stay close to the front of the tour you get a lot more time with the tour guide and ours answered any questions we had while we waited for the rest of the tour to go through. The only somewhat difficult part of this tour was the 160 stair climb in the middle of the tour. It is well worth it though. We tried to get in on the River Styx Tour, but it was booked at least two days in advance.

Really, I thought my trip was average but I think that if I were to go in the middle of the week or when children are in school I would have a much better time. The grounds are just beautiful and there is so much human history here. The trails are not bad to walk and there is a lot of wildlife around. We saw Turkeys and Deer, Squirrels, frogs, and a few spiders. All of the paths are well marked and all of the rangers are very nicce and will answer any questions you may have. We took the snowball tour and we got to have lunch in the snowball room and that was so cool. There is a lot of damage done to the cave but it adds to the uniqueness of it. They offer some nice warm soup and a box lunch with a drink for about $9. Some of the tours can be very long so if you aren't up for a lot walking and stair climbing then you will be very limited on what you can see.

Mammoth Cave,"It is highly suggested to make reservations ahead of time (Internet or phone). These longer tours usually sell out. The 4.5 hour Grand Avenue tour is a more comprehensive 4 mile underground hike than the shorter and more frequent tours. Parts of this tour are fairly strenuous requiring steep uphill climbs and steep narrow staircases. Very young children might be overwhelmed by the time, distance and stamina for this hike. There are two rest room break points on the tour. If a strenuous walk is not for you, there are plenty of other shorter tours to choose from (but still reserve ahead of time). Mammoth Cave doesn't have very many features,it is a ""dry"" cave. If you're expecting Carlsbad Caverns you will be very disappointed. What makes Mammoth special is the vast length of interconnected passageways.","July 27, 2012",The 4.5 hr Grand Avenue tour is great,77,"Atlanta, Georgia",4
Mammoth Cave,"We arrived and wondered at first where all the people were... umm.. in the cave.. under our feet...At first I thought that the price was a little high for our Historic Tour tickets, totaling $44 for 3 adults and one child, but we felt like we got our money's worth at the end!IF YOU GO- plan ahead and reserve your tour tickets online!! We reserved our tour the day before- it was actually my third choice, as my first two picks were already booked- one of them for about 6 days out even!The Historic Tour takes you through the natural entrance of the cave and the rangers do a nice job of recounting the exploration and discovery of the majority of the caves. At one point, they even demonstrate the amount of light early explorers viewed the cave from, and then go all the way into the dark for just a moment! The only downside (cave humor pun) was we didn't get to see a lot of the features one might expect, such as stalactites/mites and fossils. I'm sure that's all available on a different tour, but if that's what you are going for, don't choose the Historic Tour.It appears that the visitor center is going through some either renovations or additions, which is good, as it's pretty crowded inside the center.Last tip- there are small lockers for rent that only cost $.50 or $.75. If you go in the summer, bring long pants and sweatshirts to keep warm, and put your summer clothes, sandals, sunglasses etc. in there. You won't have to lug them back through the heat or carry them on your tour. They are located right by the pavillions where tours begin, so they are very convenient.. just don't lose your key in the cave!!","July 27, 2012","I could spend weeks there, and still not see enough!",21,Michigan,5

They recommended the self guided tour for $4 if you wanted a brief cave visit. The official outside had told us there were no self-guided tours at all on Sunday, but the young rangers looked mystified, said they were running the self-guided tours themselves, and assured us they were on duty from 9:30 AM Sunday.

Mammoth Cave,"My first suggestion is that you call and check on the ""walk in"" tour (no reservations needed) if that's the one you're interested in . The brochure we picked up in our hotel did not show all the times available. Other than that tour, it's suggested you sign up ahead of time. When we arrived we saw that there was a 9:45am tour that was NOT listed in the brochure. It was 1 1/2 hr and the time went quickly. You have to be on a guided tour to enter the caves. There are lots of tours, some lasting several hours. A gentleman at our hotel said the tour he wanted was sold out so he was staying an extra day to get on the one he wanted to go on with his daughter.

Mammoth Cave,"Best part of this vacation is that the weather on the surface is irrelevant when you're underground! It's always 55ish, dark and dry. The Rangers are knowledgeable and friendly. The tour variety has something for all. I recommend booking ahead, especially if you'd like ""Easy"" tours for walking as those are popular with families. My 8 year old had no problem with moderate level tours. Our healthy 75 year old also did well on the 2 hour moderate tour, but was tired after. Wear walking shoes. We did 2 tours total and I thought I'd want to do more, but I had my fill of rocks by then and got lots of info on geology and cave history. Read tour descriptions and note that many tours overlap each other. The restaurants at the park (I ate at 2 of them) are affordable and tasty. The trails (I hiked one) cover beautiful forest and one is stroller friendly. Deer and turkey are everyone. Super Charming.Cave City, KY is a small, back woods kind of place.

We did the self-guided tour of Mammoth Cave, and we were amazed by the sheer size of it. Also, unlike caves we've visited before, this one did not have stalagtites and stalagmites. It was more like a huge underground auditorium. The sheer size of it took our breath away. We visited on a sweltering day in July when the heat index above ground was over 100 degrees. Underground, in the cave, it was 57. This was a welcome relief from the heat. The rangers inside the cave told us all kinds of interesting things ... ranging from the creatures that live there (fish with no eyes!), to prior uses for the cave and the earliest explorations.

Mammoth Cave,"My dad's side of the family settled here in the 1780's and many still live in the area. Tradition says that my 4th great grandfather was the settler who chased a bear into the historic entrance ""discovering"" the cave (although it was well known to Native Americans for thousands of years), so it was only fitting that I'd bring my husband and kids here.Mammoth Cave lives up to its name. There are currently 390 miles of recorded passageways with many more yet to be discovered. It's a dry cave so you won't see a lot of stalagmites, but don't let that deter you. Bring a sweatshirt or light jacket. The cave temp is a cool 55-57 degrees Fahrenheit summer or winter. The cool air feels fantastic on a hot summer day but may get a bit chilly after an hour or so.Wanting my kids to learn about this, I took them on the Snowball Tour which is a moderate walk through an open area to the Snowball Dining Room which is really just an open area with two carts and cold sandwiches (Let's just say we tossed most of our cold cuts on white bread and soggy pasta salad.) The ambiance is cool, but don't book the trip just to eat in the cave. Instead, try the Historic Tour (about 2 hours) which contains Fat Man's Misery, Bottomless Pit and some beautiful formations, or the Grand Tour (about 4 hours) with the Frozen Niagara formation.","July 20, 2012",Touring my ancestral stomping ground,17,Cleveland,4

About 600 stairs on the whole tour, but if you take your time, you'll not only enjoy it, you'll get a workout. The part of the cave we saw was the original entrance and it was remarkable. We had an excellent park guide who kept up a pretty fast pace and it still took about 2 hours. Warnings about footing and flashlights are good ones. In some places, the footing can be dicey and the whole cave is fairly dark. Hang on to your kids. I would not have missed this with my grandkids for anything.

Guides are very knowledgeable and share a lot of information. Lunch is available on this tour (extra charge) and was sufficient. There are two bathroom breaks on this tour. There are breaks at the top of steep ascents. The tour was fascinating and we saw amazing sights everywhere. This is a must if you are able and want a good long tour. Tour begins almost mid-way in the cave system and ends at Frozen Niagara. The second tour we booked was the River Styx tour. It is 2.5 miles long, 2.5 hours, does not include food options or bathroom breaks. It begins at the Historic Entrance of the caves, enters massive chambers, then into more narrow spaces that are not as tall as Grand Ave. tour. Tour meanders down to the underground river, finishes by exiting near Mammoth Tower (lots of steps). This tour is not as strenuous as the Grand Avenue tour, but there are plenty of steps and some hills. Both were fantastic and gave us a great view of most of the cave system. The River Styx tour focuses on the geology of the cave. ","July 17, 2012",Amazing Cave,4,"Carrboro, NC",5

Mammoth Cave,"Visited Mammoth Cave recently and took the Grand Avenue Tour. This was roughly a four hour tour of the cave and did have a few difficult spots with stairs or a few ups and downs, but was an enjoyable tour. Mammoth does seem to lack the spectacular formations that you'll find in other caves, but what it may lack in beauty it makes up for in size. Mammoth is one of the largest (if not the largest) cave system in the world and any tour will provide some history and sites to see. Probably overshadowed by the underground caverns are the surface trails which are plenty. There is a small network of trails around the main visitors center that provide several hours of hiking (I recommend the Green River trail to the north of the visitors center). There are a series of longer trails outside of the visitors center which unfortunately I was unable to see (the Green River ferry crossing was not running due to low river conditions). Mammoth is great exploration for both above and below ground hikers. You can take a quick hour tour, or spend several days exploring the area. I recommend.","July 16, 2012",Mammoth Cave,79,"Utica, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"Many of the destinations on this part are Mammoth cave tours or part of tours. The Historic Tour takes groups of up to 120. It was difficult to hear the guides due to people being rude. There are stairs on this one and the website gives you details of tours and making reservations in advanced. The trog tour for 8-12 years old was great for my son. He talked and talked and new everything when we took our Historic tour. For only 1$ more than historic tour, you can take River Styx tour MAX of 40 people and it includes the whole Historic tour plus a bit more. Did I mention only 40 people. Make reservations in advanced or it may be full for you. Oh yeah, the Trog and River Styx leave early morning. The Historic is at different times all day. There are othere tours. Fat man's Misery, bottemless pits, and Tall man's Agony are on Historic tour. The Starlight chamber tour is easier walking it leaves at 6:30 at night 40 people using laterns. You see some of Historic but you see the chamber, wedding chamber, and some other things. The rangers are knowledgable. If you can do it take the tours with less people it is easier to hear the history if you care about that stuff. Wonderful to take my kids to where I went as a kid.","July 16, 2012","River styx tour, historic tour, trog tour, starlight chamber tour",146,"Canton, Ohio, United States",5
Mammoth Cave,"I highly recommend the New Entrance tour at the Mammoth Caves. My 12 yo daughter and I went on it today and we had a great time. Park Ranger tour guide...last name was Elder.....was great. He was really entertaining and informative. I recommend making reservations if your schedule isn't flexible. I checked the availability the night before and since there were, what I thought, a large number of spots available, I didn't make a reservation. We arrived to find out that the tour time we wanted to go on was sold out. We ended up waiting for about 1.5 hrs and went on the 2:30 tour New Entrance tour. Try to wear decent walking shoes.

Mammoth Cave,"We didn't have a lot of time to stop on a trip from way north down to Florida - but we don't make it to KY very often (ever), so we only had time to do the Mammoth Passages tour. Know that MC is in the central time zone! We arrived an hour earlier than we had planned. The visitors center (VC) is beautiful with pristine bathrooms! We confirmed a previous review that the gift shop in the VC is pretty weak and the gift shop in the adjacent hotel is 5X better. I couldn't believe it, but many of the tours were sold out after 10 a.m. (Saturday/Mid-July). We did the 8:45 a.m. mammoth passages tour. It was the 1hr 15min that we had time for and was very nice, except for a family with small children that didn't know enough to go to the back of the tour so the rest of us could hear the tour guide. It was kind of generic and certainly made us want to do other tours, but we had 10 hours of travel ahead of us that day. They say the average temp on all tours is 54 degrees so bring a sweatshirt for everyone. Overall, Mammoth Cave is quite remarkable - with 392 miles of mapped cave, it's the largest in the world and with the cabins and kayaking and hiking in the national park, it would make for a great vacation in and of itself for the cave enthusiast!","July 15, 2012",#1 in the world for a reason,53,"New Hartford, New York",5

Mammoth Cave,"I was disappointed in this cave tour for the following reasons:Tour group size of 120 people is way too big. There is very little (if any) interpretation of what you are seeing in the cave between the 2 designated stops unless you walk with the ranger and ask as you go.The cave (this tour anyway) is below average for scenery/interest as far as caves go. Maybe other tours at Mammoth Cave have many pretty features-- but this one just has one pretty stretch at the end.This ""2 hour"" tour includes only about 30 minutes of actually walking through the cave. Another 45 minutes is spent in one of 2 grouping areas waiting for the whole group to appear and then listening to some interpretive dialog after everyone finally arrives. And then about 45 minutes is spent shuttling by (school) bus to the cave entrance and hearing 2 orientation spiels, one before getting on the bus and another after. Note that some of the buses are not air conditioned.The park rangers at this park are the least experienced/mature that I have ever seen in my visits to at least 75 National Park Service facilities. I found them to be more of the giggling Taco Bell employee caliber, not at all the witty, intelligent, and conscientious ranger that one tends to expect at a national park. But I liked the two rangers who did my tour.Those who wore shorts and T-shirts were the smart ones. The cave is so clammy that it doesn't feel very cool, and those of us who wore warm clothes just about passed out in the 100 degree heat in the not air conditioned school bus driving the 10 minutes to the cave entrance.The interpretive center is currently just a bus loading and ticketing station, absolutely no displays to learn anything (although there is some building addition construction going on).As to the whole area, I was turned off by the nature of the tourist traps around the park, although staged gunfights and large concrete dinosaur statues may be more your cup of tea.","July 10, 2012",New Entrance Tour,11,"Bloomington, Minnesota",2

We had hoped to get tickets for the historic tour, but everything was sold out so we got tickets for the mammoth passage tour. It was very neat and quite manageable for young children. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and nice. I was sad that my children didn't get to see a lot of the neat formations as on the other tours, but they loved what they did see. Next time, we will definitely get there earlier so we can get tickets. Also, the gift shops were very nice, especially the Cave Company in the hotel. I was even able to find scrapbook stickers for my vacation album. We spent a lot of time browsing.

You have to experience the Rotundra room just to see how huge this cave is and realize you are 140 feet underground. I enjoyed hearing about the human history of the cave too. Researchers had only just recently discovered a cache of grass shoes left by ancient Indians who used the caves.I have to admit we had trouble finding the Visitors Center but I think that is because we did not realize how very huge this national park is. We went to the Cumberland Gap a few days later and I was amazed to see the same karst topography there too.

We did the new entrance tour and I would say that the second half was better than the first. We have done some other caving and much prefer ""living"" caves. That being said, we knew that when we booked. The tour size was too big IMO - if you got stuck behind someone slower, you were committed to that spot for a while until a opening presented itself. The stairs were a non-issue and we got to see an owl in the wild as we waited to enter - quite a treat.","July 9, 2012","Great guide, nice experience",3,"Franklin, Tennessee",4

That lasted about the 189 steps it took to be in the cave. 4 miles of cement slabs, the snow ball cafe was a joke. The so called snow balls looked like a melting mess that had car exhust all over it. Not one formation until the end which was the Frozen Niagra and that wasn't that great. 5 years ago we tried to take the tour but did not have reservations so we never got in.

The cave is huge in some place and so small in others that you have to bend and suck in that gut. So, you better not be closter phobic and concerned about your weight. Wear very comfortable shoes, no flops, and bring a light jacket. The cave is a constant 54 degrees so it gets cold after the 2 hour tour which is the standard ""Historic"" Tour.It is long walk to the cave, long hual in the cave, and a long hike out of the cave back to the visitor center.

She really knew her subject. This if 4 miles of strenuous walking much of it uphill. If you dont hike or excercise you are going to have problems. We had an excellent experience due to the guide.

Mammoth Cave,"We drove several hours out of our way on a long road trip to see the park, family of 5 with kids 7, 5 and 2 years of age. Arrived late and spent the night in Elizabethtown KY before getting to park next morning. All five of us took the ""New Entrance"" tour of the cave, rated as ""moderate"" difficulty. There were indeed plenty of steps, but more down than up (tour enters and leaves from different points) and we were able to get through without any problems with me carrying our 2-year-old most of the way. Path gave us pause on a few spots (crossing very deep vertical shaft; going through a few tight spots with kid in arms) but this tour is entirely do-able for a family with small kids or anyone in reasonable physical condition. Two suggestions: reserve tours online beforehand and keep in mind that temperature in Mammoth Cave is usually something like 55-56 degrees Fahrenheit (long sleeve short or even light jacket) - this was case during our visit despite outside temperature around 100 F. It seems that most tours marked ""moderate"" difficulty will be suitable for families with kids. If you don't have a scheduled tour there are also self-guided tours with park rangers stationed to answer questions - we didn't do this but there was a steady stream of visitors going into the ""historic entrance"" which is down a walking path very close to the Visitors Center. We had a late lunch at the Mammoth Cave Hotel (attached to Visitors Center) which was nothing special but perfectly fine. Visitors Center looked very new with expansion continuing. I can highly recommend a visit to Mammoth Cave National Park.","July 3, 2012","Hard to reach, but well worth the visit... and great for kids",18,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"We called the day before, as we were unsure of when we would arrive for a tour up until that time. I didn't know what tour to book, so we did the historic tour because of start time and that it would be family-friendly. We stayed in Elizabethtown the night before and drove the hour to the park. Free, plentiful parking. The visitor center is nice. I picked up our tickets and we looked through the gift shop. I am glad we went outside and over to the hotel. The gift shop in the hotel had much more to choose from and better options. We saved purchasing until after, but did end up at the hotel gift shop to get souveniers. The tour has 125 people in it. We weren't expecting so many people! We jockeyed to stay close to the tour guide to get the most out of the tour. We tend to ask a lot of questions and like to hear everything guides have to offer. They make a big deal of the 400 steps you go up or down on this tour, but it was nothing. Not one of the kids complained. The 2 mile tour is also nothing to worry about. It is slow and broken up. The cave is amazing!! We all enjoyed the tour and we want to go back for more! This is just such a small piece of it. I know we will make another trip to Mammoth to see more. Highly recommend!

However, if you have the time the two compliment each other very well. They describe the difficulty as ""moderate"", I'd call this moderate-easy.

I took the Snowball Cavern tour primarily because we got to eat lunch in the Snowball Dining room. It was fun and we had a good guide but i was surprised at how little decoration is in these caves. I am also used to visitng caves with few and sometimes no other tourists and this was a bit crowded. And I took two of the smaller group tours. My other tour was the Star Chamber tour which is taken by lantern and was amazing. Just seeing how it must have been was amazing but the tour went to very interesting locations as well. I would recommend this tour over the Snowball one. It wasn't a bit scary though some of the younger children seemed a bit apprehensive. You might want to keep that in mind. I also have extremely good night vision and was one of the lantern bearers so didn't have any problems with tripping.

Mammoth Cave,"We've been to quite a few nations parks and were excited to travel to Mammoth Cave. The location is an easy 90min drive from Louisville so no need to necessarily stay around here. The park is clean and friendly as one would expect from a national park, and there's plenty of good gift shops, informative guides and rangers, and very new rest areas and tour stations.I'd highly reccomend using the terrible NPS website and looking up the descritpion of different tours before going. Also, I'd reccomend booking via phone and just picking up tickets there. The tours were selling out in early June, so I can't imagine what July or August would be like. Also the tours are pretty cheap for what you get - around 12 dollars per tour for most.The cave itself is by far unlike any caving experience we've had. It lives up to it's name, and the rangers are highly knowlegable about the cave. My main problem was the size of the tours - easily around 70 - 100 people per tour! So at times it felt like you were filing along through a cave, rushing to the next sight. We hung more towards the back to fire off photos and such, which helped a bit. We did the historical tour that morning, had a quick hour for lunch, then did the New Entrance tour in the afternoon. Both were equally good and we saw completely different parts of the cave - and both were fairly strenuous. Plus the cave is very cold, so be sure to bring long sleeves. Also for lunch, there's a small cart which looks like it just sells pop, but also has cold cheap sandwiches so as to avoid the insane lines at the 'sit down' restaurant.Overall this place shouldn't be missed, but no need to stay around this area necessarily, and certainly book your tours in advance after doing some research.","June 21, 2012","A Beautiful Park, But Crowded Tours",154,Pittsburgh,4

Mammoth Cave,"Go to the website for Mammoth Cave and review the different tours available, as they have different levels of difficulty and cover different areas. The Grand Avenue tour covers the most, but it's also 4 hours long. I took the Historic and New Entrance tours, both 2 hours long, and felt they gave a good sense of the caves, and together they covered most of what is on the Grand Avenue tour. These two tours were not really strenuous at all, and I'm over 50 and get winded easily on a run. There are areas on the Historic Tour called Fat Man's Misery and Tall Man's Misery, but they are not difficult at all unless you're a candidate for The Biggest Loser or in the NBA. The Historic Tour was a pretty dry cave but the New Entrance had water dripping and more classic cave formations. I would've liked to try the Intro to Caving tour or the Wild Cave Tour, as they sounded more adventurous, but I had kids that couldn't go on them. Plus, I didn't have the hiking boots they require. It's a good idea to reserve tours ahead of time online so you don't risk getting shut out of a tour you had planned on. I was still able to get tickets easily a couple of days before I went. They say to bring a jacket because of the cold, but being a hardy Michigander, I was fine in a T-shirt. You can bring water in a clear plastic bottle, but I never got thirsty. Be sure to use the bathroom at the Visitor Center, because it'll be two hours before you can get back to a bathroom.

I am not in the best shape and was 17 weeks pregnant, but I was glad I made the tour. It was very flat in the beginning and had some hills closer to the middle and end. It finished off with the Frozen Niagara formation, a great way to end our tour. After each major ascension, we were able to sit and rest for about 5-7 minutes. At this time, our guide would tell us something about that section of the cave. Our guide, Kevin, was great. He has been there for many years and is very knowledgeable as well as funny! We enjoyed his humor and fun spirit. After about a 1.5 miles (all very flat), we stopped in the Snowball Room for lunch. They had lunch you could purchase, but we brought in sandwiches and snacks. The website states that you could only bring in food in a clear backpack or ziploc bags, but apparently they've recently changed this and you can now carry in bags or backpacks. They did ask us to bring in clear water bottles, though they never checked this. For $8.50 boxed lunches, I think you got a sandwich, soup and drink. They also had bathrooms and water fountains here. We also stopped a mile later at another restroom.On the Historical Tour, $12/each, we entered and exited through the Historical Entrance. This tour was much slower paced, but very informative. There was lots to see including the Rotunda, Giant's Coffin, Fat Man's Misery, Sidesaddle Pit, Bottomless Pit and Mammoth Dome (my fav part!). Beware as there are no restrooms on this tour! It's only 2 miles and 2 hours for the entire tour. The hardest part was probably the hill walking back up to the Visitor Center.The temperature on the tours was very comfortable, about 54 degrees. We wore long pants and t-shirts and carried a long sleeve or light jacket with us.","June 18, 2012",Grand Avenue Tour and Historical Tour,17,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5
Mammoth Cave,"Visited Mammoth Cave with 3 ten year olds. We took the New Entrance tour which was a moderate tour. This seems like a good tour since its only a couple of hours and you get to see quite a bit. There are a lot of stairs to walk down and its neat the way they go around and through some of the passages. There a couple of stops for some talk by the tour guide. The place was pretty crowded for a Monday, but I'm not sure how busy it normally is. If you want any of the more difficult tours, you need to book in advance. Those were the only ones sold out when we were there. We took a hike through the woods on one of the trials while we waited for our tour to start. Overall, it was well worth going too.","June 17, 2012",Mammoth Cave visit with 10 year olds,33,"Chicago, Illinois",4
Mammoth Cave,"Enjoyed both of these cave tours because they showed different parts of the cave, but if I had to choose my favourite, it would be the Frozen Niagara. Why? Because the scenery inside is prettier! No sweatshirt or jacket required for this tour as it wasn't cold inside....a t-shirt will be fine. However, bring it along for the Star Chamber tour, as it was cold and damp inside, especially towards the end of the tour. Only 10 people will be carrying a lantern.....they leave them at the front at the beginning of the tour and anybody who is interested in carrying one can do so. We booked our tickets through the online reservation system a week before and are glad we did or we'd have been out of luck. (On the day of the tours, only the Historic and New Entrance tours were available, probably because over a hundred people go on each tour which is way too many people in my opinion). I liked the fact that both of the tours I did had less than 40 participants, making it easier to ask questions and hear the guide talk.","June 17, 2012",Frozen Niagara & Star Chamber Cave Tours,64,"Ontario, Canada",5
Mammoth Cave,"Unless you are in great shape, your lower legs will be a-hurtin' for several days because of the steep inclines and stairs on this tour.The pain was worth the tour. Our guide was informative and great!","June 16, 2012",Grand Avenue Tour,60,"Houston, Texas",5
Mammoth Cave,"Because we arrived later in the afternoon than planned we were only able to catch the New Entrance tour. It was fun and although it is supposed to be one of the longer tours with lots of stairs it wasn't taxing for this 53 year old with so-so knees. I would love to come back and explore more of the cave trails, especially since this is one of the more reasonably priced guided tours I have been on. Do remember to bring an overshirt or light sweater as it's in the mid-50's in the caves.","June 16, 2012",Wished I could have toured more,45,Colorado Springs,4
Mammoth Cave,"If you are at least 16 years old, and no larger than 42"" in your widest point you MUST go on this tour. I have seen the Grand Canyon and it was incredible BUT the WCT at MCNP had to be the most awe inspiring and demanding thing I have ever done. It is well worth the price of admission and the personal satisfaction of lasting 6+ hours on my knees, free climbing and squeezing thru passages makes me want to do it again...... Only 14 people can go on this tour which is offered 6 days a week (1 trip a day) BOOK IT NOW...... you will not be disappointed.","June 15, 2012",Mammoth Cave (Wild Cave Tour),1,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"We did the Historical tour in the morning and the New Entrance tour in the afternoon. I put 14,000 steps on my fitbit and 47 ""flights"" of stairs. They have tours suitable for nearly every fitness level. These were moderate, so a good workout, lots of great scenery, and great cave stories. Keep in mind what they say about the steps. Historical tour seemed more strenuous than New Entrance. New Entrance showcases stalagmites and stalactites. ","June 13, 2012",Caves and tour guides were amazing!,26,"Clarkston, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"We were looking forward to going on a self-guided tour into the cave. When we arrived we approached an ""attendant"" who was slouched in his chair and couldn't even be bothered to sit up in a professional manner to answer questions. He told us that the self guided tour wasn't available because it was only as demand warranted. Apparently even though all the other tours were sold out it still didn't warrant the demand for another tour. We left the main building and spoke with a park ranger who told us that the best we could hope for was to go to the old tour entrance and ""look in"". It's a shame that even though there were close to a dozen park rangers standing around doing nothing, none of them were very helpful.","June 12, 2012",Disappointing,34,"St. Petersburg, Florida",2
Mammoth Cave,"Great, educational way to spend a weekend with kids, filled with outdoor activity. We did the New Entrance and Star Chamber cave tours, which gave us a good all-around cave experience, and our whole family (hub & I, kids 8 and 11) thought it was totally cool. The New Entrance tour has 120 people in it, and you take a bus to the cave entrance. The tour moves pretty quickly, so don't plan on stopping and taking a lot of photos - you'll really annoy the people behind you. There are a lot of stairs, but unless you have joint problems or health issues, it's very manageable. The Frozen Niagara was amazing! Doing the Star Chamber tour at night in the dark gave us a contrasting experience, allowing us to about its 'man-made' history. They turn the lights on at the very end, and we were totally blown away! This part of the cave is chilly, a brisk 54 degrees of damp cold, so wear a jacket and reconsider flip-flops - you'll be walking on dirt floors and gravel, and there is a lot of walking and standing, and not much sitting. We did both these tours in the same day, and we were pretty wiped out at the end. But we had enough energy to hike for miles the next day; the trails are outstanding! Food-wise, I would skip the Travertine restaurant unless you're starving and don't feel like driving anywhere. Their breakfast buffet was skimpy and really unimpressive. The Crystal Lake room doesn't allow kids in it because it's a bar, and the other restaurant was closed when we were there. The Mazatlan in Cave City was pretty good, excellent service, if you like Mexican food.","June 11, 2012","Great, active family getaway",35,"Dayton, OH",5
Mammoth Cave,"very good tour and experience, i was surprised by the steep stairs going in at first but not a pick deal after i adjusted to it. Bring a jacket as it is cool obviuosly in cave.

Mammoth Cave,"We are from Florida, so the change in scenery at Mammoth National Park (mountains, forest, rivers, caves) was just what we needed. My 10 year old son had a ball! The caves are fantastic - big, dark, sometimes drippy, and full of history and geological interest. Stick to shorter tours with young children. Once you are in a cave, you are committed! We found ourselves on a large tour with a particularly loud family that seemed to have no concern for the comfort of other visitors. We were able to move up in the line to get away from them during a group presentation. We saw others in our group trying doing the same thing! But most families and kids were respectful of the caves and of the other paying visitors.We took the New Entrance tour (you go down...down...down! Lots of interesting views and formations, a good one for kids) and the Violet City Lantern Tour (in the dark with lanterns, longer with more talking and history, may be too long, quiet or creepy for younger kids but it was our favorite). All of our ranger guides were informative and enthusiastic and seemed to love what they do.The hiking trails within the park are great! Some are paved and easy, some are more wild and challenging with inclines and rocks and overlooks. We saw dozens of deer & wild turkey. My son was obsessed with chasing fireflies at night, something he's never seen. Use deet on skin and clothing in the summer, and common sense when hiking. As in any park there are snakes, although we did not see any, and we hiked as late as 8pm/dusk. Be prepared for cold caves by dressing in layers. My bald husband was happy he brought a hat into the caves, not just for the cold but for the watery drips. Also have everyone go to the bathroom before going in, as there are NO bathrooms on most tours.The park's animal presentation at night (by a ranger) was outdoors on a big screen and was very good. There are some strange and fascinating critters at the park. Go during weekdays if possible, which is what we did, and it was pleasant. I was told by locals weekends are much more crowded. I was glad we booked our tours online ahead of time. I checked in once at the park desk when we arrived and received all our reserved tour tickets up front. Done! No additional lines, no waiting. The surrounding towns are small and limited, so this trip really needs to be about the park and the outdoors. Good side trips are the Corvette assembly plant & museum in nearby Bowling Green and Chaney's Dairy Farm for lunch and yummy homemade ice cream. My son also LOVED the chair lift & alpine slide at Kentucky Action Park in nearby Cave City, which is full of weird, run-down, cheesy side show attractions that can be humorous or macabre (an old wax museum, an animal museum full of taxidermy, you get the idea!) Bowling Green is a newer, standard suburban town with more hotels and restaurants than in Cave City. We did not stay in the park but the little cabins looked fun and were near the visitor center.","June 9, 2012",Fun for the whole family! A wonderful park.,48,"Indialantic, FL",5
Mammoth Cave,"Wow, I feel kind of ashamed that I live within 6 hours or so (Memphis) from Mammoth Cave and had never been. We took our 5 kids through a couple of stops and visited Mammoth Cave. It was an awesome experience to feel the cold air from the cave and walk down into a huge, enormous, unbelievable natural cave. We did the 4:45 tour (the general one, can't remember the name). This really is a natural treasure and just an awesome way to show the kids that nature and science can be really beautiful. We were just in awe.The grounds are really special, too. Take a full day (or more), to explore the full park. The trails look great. We did a very short trail and really enjoyed it.","June 8, 2012",Inspired to go back,29,"Memphis, Tennessee, United States",5
Mammoth Cave,"We took the Frozen Niagara Tour as well as the Historic Tour while in the area and amazingly both were very different. The rangers leading the tours were very knowledgable and explained the history etc very well. Be sure to bring a jacket along as the caves are about 54 degrees at any time. I would advise getting tickets on line beforehand as tours easily sell out and if you only have a day in the area it could be disappointing. You can view all the tours, times and prices as well as purchase tickets at www.recreation.gov.","June 6, 2012",Amazing Caves and History!,90,Michigan,5
Mammoth Cave,"We took two tours on our visit, and both were terrific! We took the New Entrance tour and the Snowball tour. They were surprisingly different from each other. The cave is amazing, and our tour guides were so friendly and informative. We also hiked some of the trails up above, and we impressed with the Green River Bluff trail, the River Styx trail, and Dixon's Cave trail. The area is so beautiful. We had our young children with us, and our goal was to tire them out. Mission accomplished! This is a fantastic park, and this was our second visit. We will certainly return for more!","June 6, 2012",Fantastic!,36,"Rotonda West, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I went on the Historic Tour and Grand Avenue tour during our visit. They were both great, but the Grand Avenue tour was the best. We went through lots of different areas of the cave with all kinds of crazy things to see. The hiking was fairly easy, and I think that anyone who can handle a 4-mile moderate hike above ground and isn't seriously claustrophobic would be just fine--don't let the warnings scare you too much. Some of the surfaces were a bit slippery--wear hiking shoes, or at least good athletic shoes. You can bring a lunch on the Grand Avenue tour--box lunches are available, but don't offer many options, and vegetarian meals have to be ordered in advance. Oh yeah, this is lunch in a cafeteria 267 feet underground! Pretty neato!","June 5, 2012",So much fun!,28,"Portland, Oregon",5
Mammoth Cave,"One review is not enough since there are many tours available, exploring different parts of this huge cave. We took the historic tour and made a general impression about the cave after walking two miles (out of about 600!). I would say the visit is definitely worth it you are nearby, otherwise it's probably better to search for something else.","June 5, 2012",Interesting overall experience,212,Romania,4
Mammoth Cave,"We took the ""New Entrance Tour"" and got lucky enough to have only 17 on the tour. Our guide, Ranger Susan, was very knowledgable and explained everything in a very understandable way. Even though this was rated as moderate is was slow enough paced that even the youngest could keep up, though the two year old needed to ba carried most of the way. Beautiful sights. Well worth the effort.","June 4, 2012",Amazing adventure,9,"Durham, California",5
Mammoth Cave,"We took the Frozen Niagara tour and loved it. I purchased our tickets online beforehand and recommend doing that if you have a schedule to maintain. The day we were there only a few were still available. The ranger that led our tour was awesome; she was friendly and knowledgeable. The tour was great; really stunning.

Mammoth Cave,"MAKE RESERVATIONS ONLINE IN ADVANCE!!!! This was the only tour available to reserve a week before our travel date and by the time we arrived it was ALSO sold out. Well they told the exact truth to a T on this Grand Avenue ad, the first 2.5 hrs went pretty easy. Smooth comfortable hiking underground; with 3 kids under 10 in our group this was a relief. Then we ate ""lunch"" in the Snowball Room and the last 1.5 hrs was another story, but it was exactly as they advertised; physically demanding and 670+ stairs. Most of them straight up or straight down and over 600 are in the last mile I'd say. Steep hills to navigate up or down with no traction as dirt is smooth and slick from years of tours, Wear COMFY supportive shoes! No flip flops on this tour :) It was a beautiful tour with a very informed entertaining guide. There were breaks at appropriate times and just long enough to catch your breath and then back at it. Great workout :) This is not the typical cave experience in that the cascading water, stalactites and stalagmites and typical ""cave"" things are only in the last 1/2 mile of the tour. The other 3.5 miles is history, amazing interesting american history! The guide kept the adults entertained and the kids at the same time. I recommend keeping to the front of this tour so you don't miss anything and have to play catch up with the rest of the group. As for the lunch in the snowball room: PACK YOUR OWN, I cannot stress this enough. We were worried about carrying it given the ad saying so many hills and steps but they are all AFTER lunch so no worries!! They really should publish what a ""box"" lunch consists of but if they did NO ONE would buy it. Definitely needs to be fixed. The veg tomato soup was so hot we couldn't even eat it, one piece of lunchmeat on two pcs of bread, 1/4 c of veggie pasta, prepackaged green apples and a prepackaged quarter size cookie with a sm cup of pop or sm bottle of water. And at the $8.50 price, I can think of a lot more that could be offered. Course they will also sell you a candy bar for another $1.","June 3, 2012",Truth in advertising.....,8,"Georgetown, Kentucky, United States",4
Mammoth Cave,"The caves are absolutely stunning! Some parts of the tour I took (I don't remember the name) had some fairly tight spaces to walk through, but other than that the tour was easy! Pictures come out alright (not spectacular) depending on what kind of flash you have. The tour guides were great and you learned a lot of information on the tour. We saw an underground lake and some rivers which was pretty cool!","June 1, 2012",Stunning!,27,"Strongsville, Ohio",5

Mammoth Cave,"We did the 4 hour Grand Avenue tour. I went in expecting the ubiquitous stalactites and stalagmites that you see in caves, but was surprised to find there were hardly any of these until the end. Hiking Grand Avenue was like hiking in the slot canyons in Arizona and Utah--only it's all underground! Lots of winding, narrow passageways with interesting rock formations. It was also neat to see the grafitti left by tourists in the 1800's. There were inscriptions like ""John from Richmond, Virginia, 7/27/1862."" It was strange to think that the Civil War was going on during this time. Our guide told us that both Confederate and Union soldiers toured these caves at the time and wrote their names using the smoke from their torches. There were also some spidery looking cave crickets on the wall and tiny bats. I really enjoyed this tour and would like to go back to do another.","June 1, 2012",Surprisingly great cave experience,48,"Miami, Florida",4
Mammoth Cave,"We traveled as a family. We took my daughter and husband with us to see the sites in Kentucky. Since we live in such a great state we thought a tour of Mammoth Caves and a stay in the park was a nice way to spend a couple of days. We went on the Niagara tour early as a warm up. We had a wonderful park Ranger named Barb. She answered many questions and provided us with continous information and was knowledgeable about the Cave system. Thank you Ranger Barb! Also if you go look out for wishing rocks! You wish you had not hit your head on. That is from Ranger Barb. This trip was an .8 of a mile and we were in the wet area of the cave with many formations. Ranger Jeremy lead us through a 2 hour tour of the Historical tour. We learned a-lot about the history of the cave and those who discovered the passageways and who these people were. Artifacts in the cave still remain. Would have liked them pointed out. We had a large group so at times it was hard to move and other times we moved really fast. This tour is not for those who cannot walk up many stairs. The web site has information about each tour and you need to consider which tour is best for you, your family, their ages and medical conditions. The tours are rated to how easy, difficult etc they are. The Rangers also explain what the tour is going to be like so you can change your mind before you enter the cave. Make reservations and plans ahead. Always a good way to get cool on a hot day. The Historical tour is in the dry cave area with some areas of moisture. Thank you Rangers Barb and Jeremy.","May 31, 2012",Enjoyed my revisit and tour of the caves.,42,"Lexington, Ky.",4

We uended up taking the budget self guided tour that is about a half mile and seems like a limestone storage cave. No cave formations in this tour. Also, caves are 55 degrees, take a sweater, it will be cool inside.","May 29, 2012",Make a reservation,40,"Indianapolis, Indiana",3

Mammoth Cave,"We went on Memorial Day weekend and we have three kids- ages 7, 3, and 22 months. We went on the ""New Entrance"" cave tour. It was very, very difficult to pack the kids through the various walks. I was having to bend sideways and do the limbo, all while trying not to drop the kid over the edge. It was very slick and hard to walk and you weren't supposed to touch the walls. Altogether, it would be a great trip for kids who were able to walk and be ""safe"" without you packing them. Otherwise, there are several spots in this area where you can just jump right off the edge into hundreds of feet of fall. Be very careful on this tour- I would recommend another tour. This was the one we were recommended on and I was in astonishment that they recommended this once I got there. Obviously, you can not bring a stroller or anything on this trip. I would be afraid to bring a sling for the baby because the railing is very low and they could just fall right out. However, the views inside the cave are pretty good and the kids enjoyed themselves but was very difficult for the adults!","May 27, 2012",Good trip but not so great for small kids,97,"Pikeville, Kentucky",4
Mammoth Cave,"I've wanted to go to Mammoth for years, and wasn't disappointed with my recent visit! It's the largest cave system in the world at 390+ miles. We tourists get to see about 12 miles, which is plenty. However, you have to go on a couple different tours in order to see it all. I took the Historic, Grand and Violet tours over the course of a couple days. It's a LOT of walking, but worth it. However, if you don't normally walk 12 miles in two days, don't go because the guides won't coddle you (yay!) You need to book the tours ahead of time, esp in busy season. I wanted to go caving, but they were sold out and only offered it on weekends, plus my hips might have been an inch too wide--seriously, there are some NARROW passages they spelunk through, so again, don't go caving unless you're serious about it.One of our tour guides, Jerry, was amazing. He is truly a great story teller and I would pay good money just to go back and have him tell me stories. Thank you, Jerry, for sharing. I camped at the campground nearby; it was clean, pretty and had everything a car tent camper would need. I could walk everywhere, and did some nice hikes during the day when I wasn't in the cave. There isn't much nearby (a few other caves which I did not do) so be prepared for that.Also, keep in mind Mammoth is a DRY cave. Which means it's huge, but it doesn't have all the cool formations that wet caves have. I think it was at the end of the grand tour you do see some formations. If you want formations, go to Luray Cave in WV. Actually, do both because Mammoth is just that...mammoth!","May 23, 2012",Interesting DRY cave,77,"Madison, Wisconsin",4

Mammoth Cave,"This was my second visit to the caves, and this time we did a slightly more difficult tour, the New Entrance tour, where you head down about 250 feet underground. I will admit, it was a LOT of steps, but there were far fewer going back up, so it's manageable. There were moments going down where I got just a tad bit anxious about being in such a tight space so far underground, but it was short lived. There isn't a ton to SEE in the caves, though ""frozen niagra"" and the drapery room are amazing. It's just cool to learn about the history and to actually be hundreds of feet underground! We will definitely do another tour in the future. ","May 20, 2012",New Entrance Tour,31,"Commerce Township, Michigan",5

Mammoth Cave,"I had a day in Mammoth Cave National Park, KY and so opted to do the National Park's longest (distance) Cave Tour... ""The Grand Avenue Tour"". I went on Saturday 19th May and booked the day before and was lucky to get the last spot. So I WOULD recommend that you book in adavance if you don't want to be disappointed. I opted for this tour as I wanted a bit of a work-out and also thought that hiking for 4 miles underground was a pretty cool experience. I wasn't disappointed, the tour was informative and a very memorable experience.I have visited numerous caves in my lifetime from caves in my native UK to caves in Vietnam and other exotic locations like Cancun (where we cave snorkelled). This cave was different in that on this tour it was pretty dry (no running water apart from a couple of trckles from the roof in two places) and there are also no pretty formations (S'Mites and S'Tites) apart from at the end where you go into the Frozen Niagara chamber.What was impressive though was the sheer size and length of the cave system / passages and the fact that you are hiking through them. There are a few places where it's a little narrow and a little low (you need to stoop down to not bump your head) but in general it's all pretty open. There are steps and there are slopes to climb up and these are slippery and you DO need to hold the hand rails provided. I am a fairly fit 42 year old guy (but 250 Lbs and 6Ft) and I found it okay going. The tour literature says it is Strenuous but I would say only in a few places, the rest of the time (90%) it's steady walking. Do wear good walking footwear with a grippy sole and as the temperature is a steady 56'F (about 13'C) then you need a fleece but don't overdress. Some on our tour had T-Shirts and they seemed okay. There are two places where you can use a restroom and there are benches in places to stop for a breather and the guide does stop every so often while giving information on the cave.We had a party of about 70 persons and two guides, Myles and Kevin. They were both excellent and Kevin has been a guide since 1969 and so you can rest assured that these guys know their stuff. The tour left the Visitor Centre at 10am (be there promptly as they do run on time) and it involved a short bus ride at the start and end of the tour. Cost for an Aduklt was $25 which I think was great value for a 4.5 hour guided tour in the Worlds Longest Cave System. You can take photo's and children aged 6 years and up are welcome. There were kids on our tour who seemed to have a good time but I would say younger kids (under 10) would probably be better with a shorter (2 Hour) tour as the kids were asking about half way ""How much further?"".My Top Tip is: Stay at the front of the tour group with the lead guide. this is where I was for most of the tour and I think that enhanced my experience as you see the cave passages opening up ahead of you as you walk rather than the backs of the other 50+ people walking infront of you. plus you can ask him questions along the way.","May 19, 2012",Grand Avenue Tour = Cool Hiking Underground For 4 Miles,1218,"Northampton, United Kingdom",5

Go as soon as you can to buy your tickets (or buy ahead online) for the next day or two for the tours. Also, know what tour you want when you get in line.The ticket sales people were NOT helpful at all and will make you leave the line if you don't know what tour you want. I recommend the Historic tour as long as you are ok with small spaces and lots and lots of stairs! You can take Water bottles and I wish I had some after the long climb up the stairs. Wear comfortable shoes and it doesn't hurt to have a jacket. Of course if you are a caver ...you probably know that! :) ","May 15, 2012",Should be a wonder of the world!,24,"Nashville, Tennessee",4
Mammoth Cave,"The highlight of our weekend Kentucky trip was to visit Mammoth cave. Although we only live 2 hours from the cave, I had never been there before. My boyfriend had been several years ago and had a good experience. I had been to Marengo cave before, so it wasn't my first cave tour. We had pre-booked the ""Grand Avenue"" tour, which only ran once a day. Unfortunately, after being delayed on I-65 by wreck, which slowed traffic to a crawl and forced us to detour, we were late for the tour. We called the ticket office while sitting in traffic and luckily refunded our tickets, minus a small fee. When we finally got to the visitor's center, we booked the ""New Cave"" tour, which was 3/4 of a mile long and started about 20 minutes after we arrived. It was $12 for adults.The tour, while strenuous, was very nice. The guide was very knowledgeable and made sure everyone could hear her. The only bad part was that there was a little girl on the tour, who was probably 3 or 4, that cried when the lights were turned off in one of the rooms. I wish that kids under a certain age weren't allowed on the tours, because of the dark, tight spaces where a child could fall or get hurt. Her mom had to carry her through most of it.The tour lasted 2 hours and totally wore me out. There were hundreds of steps and several rocky ramps we had to navigate. My boyfriend, who claimed he wasn't tired, wanted to do another tour when we got back to the visitor's area, but I said no way. Because we live so close to the cave, we will most likely come back to do another tour.","May 14, 2012","Great tour, hope to return someday",31,"Evansville, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE. I had never been to a cave, and I'm told the tour I went on, ""The Historic Tour"", is the not the most amazing one, but I was most amazed. The tour was two hours and two miles. I'm overweight and lazy, and had no problem managing the hike. Every inch of the cave tour was fascinating. I strongly recommend a small LED flashlight to shine in the cracks and corners as you go. The park lighting is just enough to see your general surroundings, but I wanted more. The tour guides don't spent a lot of time talking, the cave speaks for itself. They stop at a few significant points, but mostly they let you walk and enjoy. I would say it's a bit much for any kid who can't get around on their own. It would be an awesome adventure and memory for any eight year old. You do NOT want to carry a child through this. If you are very obese, there are a few spots that might cause embarrassment. This is a tremendous value at $12.00, but coupons for 2$ off can be found in the area hotels. It's a national park, so every dollar goes to very good use. You could call it a day after one tour and be quite fulfilled. Book ahead because I'm told the peak season often sells out early. We had a small tour on May 11.","May 13, 2012",Most Amazing Thing I've Seen on Earth,35,"Atlanta, Georgia",5
Mammoth Cave,"The cave tours by the Rangers is what it's all about here. The Park Rangers are all so friendly, informative, and interesting that we loved all three tours we took. My favorite was the Violet City Lantern tour. You see an amazing amount concidering the only lighting is lanterns. Loved the experience and the 2 waterfalls you see. Also the Hisoric and Snowball tour were equally fun. There were small children in our groups that kept up without any help from their parents and seemed to enjoy the experience also. In the evening, the Rangers also gave talks on topics related to the caves in the Ampitheater area of the park. These were also well attended and very interesting.","May 9, 2012",Wonderful!,80,Buffalo,5
Mammoth Cave,"We just got back from a quick trip to Mammoth Caves NP and wish we had time to stay longer. We took the 3 hour, 2 mile Snowball Cave Tour. Our guide Ranger Richard was incredibly knowledgeable about the geology of and wide variety of species living in the cave. The tour followed a nice path through the cave so was relatively easy, but a lot to see. After we walked a mile we came to the Snowball cafeteria where we were able to purchase lunch and there were restroom facilities there as well. Then we returned on the same route. The cave itself is a constant temperature of 54F so bring a light jacket or sweatshirt. Aside from the cave tour the park itself is quite beautiful. It's quite an expansive forest with tons of hiking trails. It is also one of the few parks that has a system of gravel trails and allows mountain biking on them. If you're interested in camping there are several campgrounds in the park as well as a bunch of back country sites. We stayed one night at the Mammoth Cave Campground by the visitor center and loved it. It's not quite peak season yet so the campground was fairly empty. The sites are large and most are somewhat secluded by the surrounding trees. There are bathrooms and water available as well as a small camp store with shower facilities within walking distance. We also stayed one night in the back country at the First Creek B site. These sites are nice as far as back country goes because they have fire pits, which not many places offer. The trails are well trodden and most sites are near a water source which is great so you don't have to pack in all your water if you have a good filter. Overall the park exceeded our expectations and we would highly recommend it!","May 7, 2012",Better than expected!,54,"Bridgeport, Connecticut",5

If you have a National Parks pass you can get $5 off price of admission. If you go during the week there will be less people. We brought a jacket just in case. Low light or flash with slow speed cameras will light up the place.The whole tour takes about 2 hours. One thing if you do want the full experience of the Drapery room, you do have to hike down and up a lot of stairs. there was no ""optional"" about it. Just wear good traction shoes.","May 5, 2012",Nice and cool,74,"Frederick, Maryland",4
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave is aptly named. We pre-arranged online to take two tours during our stay, which is strongly recommended. Our visit was during Spring Break and our tours had 120 and 78 people on them, respectively. The Historic Tour is two hours and two miles of walking through ancient underground river beds. The Grand Avenue Tour was four hours and four miles. Grand Avenue offers more interesting rock formations (Frozen Niagara) and the opportunity to have lunch at a cafeteria in the cave. As cool as this is, the food was pretty terrible, so we recommend packing a lunch and drink. There is no fee to enter the park but there are fees for the tours. We recommend staying at the Mammoth Cave Hotel for at least one night. It can be difficult to pack in more than one major tour per day (and there are 11 choices) and you'll want to make sure you enjoy breakfast, lunch and dinner at the wonderful hotel dining room (avoid the lunch counter). Prices are very reasonable and you'll be treated to home made biscuits with homemade black cherry preserves with entree orders at dinner. The pan-fried chicken is not to be missed. Other super meals are the rainbow trout and vegetarian lasagna. Even if you don't normally order dessert, make an exception and order the blackberry cobbler a la mode. You'll be wishing you could stay longer.Rooms at the hotel are also reasonably priced. They are modest (we stayed at the Sunset Terrace) but clean.Be sure to spend some times on the trails. Highlights are the Styx River Spring trail, Cedar Sink, Sloan's Crossing Pond and the Sand Cave. Plan to travel the Houchins Ferry Road from Brownsville. The NPS runs two free ferries on the road, one at Houchins Ferry and the second at the terminus of the road at the Green River. Before leaving Brownsville, make absolutely sure you stop at Berties Ice Cream (310 S. Main Street), a family-run old-fashioned stand with a great banana shake.","April 30, 2012",Bring Good Shoes!,190,"Deep River, North Carolina",4

No strollers of course so we toted her through tall mans misery fat mans misery and all the rest. My husband is 240 6'1 and had a little trouble getting through fat mans do its true to its name. We laughed so hard I could barely get through for laughter. It was great and we loved it. We chose the historic tour. Our tour guide was a ham and we laughed and laughed about his performance on our way back to the hotel. Seeing where people had been there over a hundred years ago writing their names with candles they were using to go through the caves with was awesome!Try and spot bats on the walls! We saw one. It looks like a little grey chicken nugget. The bottomless pit is truly terrifying! My husband and i are planning to go back alone and take the longest tour. Bring a jacket! It's chilly down there!

Mammoth Cave,"We did three different tours in the course of two days. Each of the three tours began at different cave entrances and explored different sections of the cave system. None of these tours overlapped, as some of the tours do. Snowball tour - tour was about 3.5 hours in length. Tour was pretty easy though the rating is moderate. Probably rated this way due to the length of the tour. The tour departed from the visitor's center by bus. We had a short ride over to the entrance. The steps going in are very long and challenging coming back up as you leave the cave. The tour carries you to the snowball room, where you can purchase a meal for around $7. The tour is fun, but this is a dry section of the cave. There aren't any stalagmites and stalagtites to see on this tour. The most interesting thing to see is the snowball room which looks like it has snowballs all over the ceiling. Seeing the names written on the cave walls from the 1800's is also interesting. The tour retraces the path you take to the snowball room. We did three tours, and this was actually our least favorite. However, it is still good.The historic tour - this tour leaves from the visitor center. A guide leads you on a short walk to the historic cave entrance which is the original entrance to the cave. This section of the cave is also dry, so there are no stalagmites and stalagtites either. However, there is much to see. The best part is the fat man's misery section. You will also have a section with a lot of stairs on this tour. However, while the snowball tour retraced the path you took on the first half of the journey, this one is more of a circle that leads you out the same entrance you came. Lots of interesting stories on this tour. Probably the tour we most enjoyed. Moderate tour and our legs were a little sore from the climbing.Frozen Niagara Tour - this tour leaves from the visitor center by bus. The ride is relatively short and the tour is only an hour and fifteen minutes. The tour is easy and most can handle it with no problem. This section of the cave is wet, and there are lots of stalagmites and stalagtites to see. There is a small walk down a flight of stairs to the drapery room. This was by far the prettiest part of the cave. We were told the new cave entrance tour includes this section in its entireity. However, it was a longer tour and we were exhausted by this point. The cave stays about 60 degrees so dress accoringly. Most of the tours are pretty easy to do, but i would not recommend taking small children. Each tour had a time when the lights were turned out to show you what total darkness was like in the cave. We had crying children for the rest of the tour. Could have ruined the experience.","April 23, 2012",3 Tour Reviews,146,"Montevallo, Alabama",4
Mammoth Cave,"Take a short bus ride to the Carmichael Entrance to visit Cleaveland Avenue, the Snowball Room, Boone Avenue, Thorpe’s Pit, Mt. McKinley, Grand Canyon, Aerobridge Canyon, the Hippodrome, Grand Central Station, and exit through the beautiful Frozen Niagara section where buses are waiting to take you back to your car. This is a long 4 1/2 hours, 4 mile tour with a 30 minute lunch break in the Snowball Room. Your guide will keep at a steady pace and stop at times to allow the rest of the group to catch up. If you are interested in hearing interesting facts and stories from your guide you need to stick close. There are places to stop and rest and while you are resting the guide is providing historical facts and at times funny information. Our guide was awesome and was able to keep the groups attention. He was an excellent story teller! He made the hike more enjoyable.If you are physically able to climb several stairs, hills and walk for miles I highly recommend this tour.

Above ground offers some great hikes, and a trip across the Green River car ferry is a must! Also, there is a trailhead at the top of the hill near the ferry that leads down to a ground spring and stream that kids love to explore.Make sure if you travel to the area, spend time at Mammoth before getting suckered into all the other non Mammoth related caves.

Mammoth Cave,"We spent 3 days at Mammoth Cave National Park and could have stayed longer. The cave itself is just unbelieveable. We had an excellent guide who was descended from the slaves that actually initially explored the cave, so when he pointed out graffiti that his great-great-great grandfather had carved in the rock, it made quite the impression. We took two tours. The first tour was from the main entrance back aways, where you saw some of the major sites such as the War of 1812 saltpeter mining operation. The second tour was called the lantern tour because you carried kerosene lanterns like people used to, and the lack of electric lighting added a whole other dimension to the cave. In between those two tours, we rented a canoe and spent the day paddling on the Green River, which was a whole lot of fun. Mammoth Cave is a bit off of the beaten track, but I would recommend it.

What little we could hear was pretty much common knowledge,if you have ever read anything at all about the area.They rushed us through at a very fast pace,no time at all to look around.Between the constant flash photography all around us and small children with very bright flashlights it was very chaotic.We've decided to leave town tomorrow and spend the rest of our time elsewhere.Very disapointing for our four nature loving sons.

Mammoth Cave,"We have been to many caves and while this is the largest, I wouldn't say it was very beautiful but it was OK. We did the New Entrance Tour and while there were neat things to see it wasn't as spectacular and some other caves we have been in. If you have been on others, skip this one unless you do one of the more serious caving expeditions, which I didn't but think it would be fun for the adventurous ones. Also, I'm claustrophobic and would not recommend this tour to anyone else that is. I almost didn't make it through it as the first 30 minutes was a long descend in VERY narrow corridors down stairs with back to back people, it was very difficult for me only due to my claustrophic tendencies, the walk itself was easy. Once past that part it was quite open and large and I did fine.

I knew from my experience as a kid that my kids would truly enjoy this wonderful experience, and I was right.The good thing about the park is you can spend a couple of hours here and take a short tour or you can spend all weekend. We took the Historical tour and is probably the best tour to get a good taste of the whole cave. Note they offer about 10 tours of various difficulty ranging from 45 minutes to over 5 hours. See the website for details on each tour and cost. You can reserve tours in advance on the site, but I took a chance and didn't reserve as I wasn't sure what time I was coming through and all tours still had spots available. i wouldn't take a chance on a weekend. The park rangers give the tour and included almost over 100 people so it was difficult to ask a question. They do provide a wealth of information about the history of the cave.They also over exaggerate how strenuousness some of the spots to dramatize the tour. There is one spot called ""Fat Man's Misery"" that they said to be careful about. I told my kids I'm changing the name to ""Body Builders Misery"" and they got a kick about that. It was very easy to get my 260 lb body through.One of the Ranger's on the tour was a little grumpy, and didn't appreciate my daughters question ""Do humanoid cave creatures live in the cave?"" This tour is longer and has more to see than most commercial caves you might visit, and is a great experience. Some tips to know is it is always 56 degrees in the cave and the tours have lots of steps and some low ceilings. Take a lot of pictures, of course you need a flash.

The evolution of the cave has been interesting to watch and experience.As a very young child I was able to go down to the Echo River and the River Styx, where we were allowed to get on a boat and travel across. That is not an option any more as the damage done to the eco system of the cave by the wood, etc., was finally recognized. Now you can go on a tour that goes down to the River Styx, but that only takes place in summer, so we weren't able to take that tour.The biggest surprise on this outing was the new and really nice visitor center. It is huge and has a small Park Service gift shop on the south wall, a nice large ticket area, a ranger counter in the middle and lots of places to rest on benches. Big clean restrooms as well. In the past, there was a ticket kiosk and that was about it. This place also has information booths and so many rangers milling around it looks like a convention.For the grandkids one thing I love about our National Park Service is the Junior Ranger program. They are provided a booklet by the rangers and once they've completed a number of pages based on their age, they are awarded a junior park ranger badge and a certificate. The grandkids participated and loved the experience. The 6 year old ended up working through the entire book after she had already received her badge - she was really into it. It's a great program and to hear her tell me about some of the cave facts and other items she'd picked up from her work was really special for me. Judging their attention spans and level of interest, the first day we took the Historic Tour. It is two hours and two miles long, however that is broken up with lots of stops for historical information. They were bored by the history, but we weren't. They loved all the special cave features, such as squeezing through Fat Man's Misery, bending down for Tall Man's Misery, etc. It was a good introduction to the cave system and other than the talking bits, they were happy.Based on the success of the first day's tour, the next day we took the Snowball Tour. It is 3 hours and 2 miles long, however the 3 miles are broken up with a lunch in the Snowball room. This tour really highlighted the gypsum formations in the cave. The kids were not as interested in the formations, but they did enjoy the walking and the lunch. :) The park service, for $8.50, gives you a really nice lunch. It's a ham or turkey sandwich, a bowl of vegetable soup, pasta salad, sliced apples, a cookie and a drink. You can also purchase candy such as Skittles or M&M's. It was fun to eat in the cave and look at the walls/ceiling. The tour goes to the ballroom and back, but the cave looks different seeing it the ""other way"" and it was a fun time.Last day we took the New Entrance Tour. This one, in my opinion was the most fun. It is two hours and only 3/4 of a mile long, but it is a fun 3/4! You go up and down staircases, through tight and wide open spaces, but the formations are unreal. It covers so many different and unique stalagtites and stalagmites, water springs, etc. that I was really having a good time. The kids loved it as well, just because of all the different things to see.The cave is not the only thing you can do here. We hiked the surface trails for about three miles and the kids enjoyed that as well, although the 6 year old got a bit tired by the end. There is lots of wildlife around as they are never hunted, and they are not afraid of cars or people, so it was fun to watch the deer, turkeys and turkey vultures closer up than normal.There is a campground, but we weren't allowed to go in as we were staying at the Sunset Terrace part of the Mammoth Cave Hotel. However, we were allowed to go to the camp store, a small convenience type store. The prices were high as is usual for park service stores due to their location, but if you needed a drink, a snack or a cup of coffee first thing, this was the place to go. There are other attractions in the Cave City area, but honestly they looked cheesy and I was glad many of them were not open as we were there so early in the season. We did take a horseback ride through the northern part of the park and that was fun, but 1 1/2 hours for a first time 6 year old is too long. One hour would be plenty.All in all, this cave system is incredible and if you have the chance, you need to go see it first hand.","March 23, 2012","Interesting for the whole family, good exercise as well!",283,"Decatur, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"This tour was just the right length for our kids ( 6, 8 & 10). The new visitor center is beautiful. There were only about 20 people on the first tour of the day. Appeared to be many more people by the time we returned. We will be coming back to see more of the caves. 2 thumbs up from all family members. Just note that you cannot take any kind of case/ bag into the cave. . . No exceptions.","March 23, 2012",Great tour. . .New Entrance Tour,18,"Grosse Pointe Woods, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"If you like this sort of thing it's ok-inside was dark, cold and damp but we did see some pretty rock formations. I had trouble climbing the steps inside as they had water dripping on them from above-my grandson became frightened by the bats flying around.","March 17, 2012",Mammoth Cave,12,"Vine Grove, Kentucky",3
Mammoth Cave,"The caves are beautiful with a fascinating history. We took the New Entrance tour and Historic tour, which cover totally different sections of the cave. Historic tour is very interesting, though New Entrance had some prettier formations. Both guides were very good, but Kevin, who has been at the park since 1969, was absolutely phenomenal.","March 5, 2012",Natural & American History,20,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"There's something about being down inside the earth; the smells, the temperature on my skin, the markings on the walls from many years ago (do NOT write on walls please). This is a must see if ever in Kentucky. Our whole family enjoyed the cave tour. Mammoth Cave is a huge piece of history with as many stories as there are tourists. The park rangers are extremely knowledgeable and entertaining. Beware of spring break time. It's very, very crowded! A good time was still had, though. ","March 4, 2012","Very Cool, Literally",35,Kentucky,4
Mammoth Cave,"This is a great stop if you are driving south in the spring through Kentucky whatever the weather. The cave is always 55 degrees. The Historic Tour is at 11, 1, or 3. This cave is unique for its size and the tour is a two mile walk. Most fun are the winding narrow passages of Fat Man 's Misery, followed by the low ceiling of Tall Man's Misery. I never knew they sourced saltpeter to spark gunpowder for the war of 1812 from this cave. This is a National Park so anyone over 62 can buy a pass for all members of their party.","March 2, 2012",Worth a two hour stop,86,"Minneapolis, Minnesota",4
Mammoth Cave,We went on the Frozen Niagara tour. It was pretty interesting but I've been through a lot of caves throughout the country and they all seem to be very similar. Really- If you've seen one you've seen them all. The kids loved it though. The guide was very entertaining and informative on the bus ride to the cave entrance.,"March 1, 2012",Nice cave,35,"Omaha, Nebraska",4
Mammoth Cave,"The Cave are fun for the whole family, and there are different one to choice from, there is different price so check out the web site to find how much it will cost you. Good place to visit for a day trip with family. ","February 28, 2012",Mammoth Cave,78,"Russell Springs, Kentucky",4
Mammoth Cave,"I was extremely disappointed that I didnt get to go on the tour I wanted!! Twice I have visited Mammoth Cave and I have yet to see the frozen niagra!! I guess I am going to have to teach my family how to tell time better!! We ended up taking the 2 hr Historic Tour and we had a good time. My 4 yr old was able to manage the whole thing without any help!! In fact I think there were a few jealous people when it came to Fat Mans Misery and Tall Mans Agony, seeing as how he had no problems and didnt even have to worry about hitting his head!! The tour guides were informative and helpful. I am going to have to go back next year and take a different tour. There are many different ones that take you through different parts of the cave and we have only hit the high spots.","February 27, 2012",a mammoth experience,51,"Knoxville, Tennessee",5
Mammoth Cave,"These caves are truly awesome to see. There are so many to see. Just pick one and go ... you'll be glad. We've always planned ahead and gotten tickets before we arrive. If you don't and you just show up, you may not get to take a tour that day. ","February 24, 2012",Nicely done National Park,31,owensboro kentucky,4
Mammoth Cave,"Our family hikes on the property a few times a year. Deer are often spotted, and a variety of birds. There should be a cave tour to meet most people's needs. We like the Historic Tour. ","February 24, 2012",Mammoth Great Time,36,Kentucky,5
Mammoth Cave,We went on Martin Luther King Jr. Weekend in 2012. We had some different options with the tours provided. I had never been there before and was very pleased. There were several options for tours and ways to learn and explore a bit of the cave. We did the historic tour. It covered the most ground. The tour guides each have their own way of doing the tour and telling the story of the cave. So you may not hear the same thing as another visitor unless you happen to have the same guide. There is alot to learn about how the cave was discovered who was there before us and about different rooms and how much there is going on underground. It was a neat experience. It was very different from a small cave I had been in as a child. This was truly mammoth in 95% of the areas we saw. I recommend checking it out. It is like nothing I have experienced to date.,"February 20, 2012",Mammoth experience in a short time!,49,"Indianapolis, Indiana",4
Mammoth Cave,"We took the Historic Mammoth Tour. It was a pleasant experience. The guide shuts off the lights behind you, don't lag behind. Footing is decent. Our guide reminded us of Ned Flanders from the Simpsons which added to the tour. We are happy we experienced it. There are many tours throughout the day. Different tours range from beginners to advanced cavers. I would recommend you bring your own flashlight.","February 3, 2012",Mammoth Greetings,66,"Hillsborough, North Carolina",3
Mammoth Cave,"There were many different tour options that we now need to plan to go back. There are longer more intense tours, but there are many that a two year old could handle. And with the trails around there one could spend a couple days exhausting the possibilities. We also thought the Junior Ranger program they have for the kids was excellent. Many that take a couple minutes for them to do and some a lot longer. It was something that was age dependent as well. Only downside is that one could not use a backpack on the tour - no bags either. A Bit of a pain, but definitely easily remedied.","January 30, 2012",So many options we need to go back,48,"Elgin, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"I am a ""CAVE"" lover. I've not met a cave I didn't like. Mammoth Cave has many different tour options based on length of time for each tour. You will not only see cave formations, but you will hear about ""the early days."" This is always my favorite part. I loved hearing about how the cave was discovered and about how it has been used through the years. Mammoth Cave is a MUST if you get anywhere around Bowling Green, KY.","January 29, 2012",There is a reason this draws folks from around the world.,1,,5

Mammoth Cave,"like the cave, and trails; such orail as the turn hole and cidar sinks, my parents raise crops down in the cidar sinks and used a pulley to get the crops. Joppa Church is still in the park and that is the church my parents attended many years ago. At the time their land was taken for the park, they lived near pig. I love the tours inside the cave, lots of beautiful rock to see and I like to camp in the campsite near the cave.U will always go back to the park as long as I am able, because of it's beauty and all of the memories it holds for me.","January 15, 2012",my parents used to live where the park is now,19,"Louisville, Kentucky",5
Mammoth Cave,"To make the most of your visit, you should visit the NPS website and read the descriptions of the available tours for your visiting day(s). We decided in advance to do the Frozen Niagara Tour. I called in advance to be sure that the tours would be operating on Thanksgiving Day, which they were. Since there were fewer tours that day, we knew we needed to be there when the visitor center opened. Some tours you could reserve in advance, but this tour they do not take reservations. As it turned out, there was plenty of room on our tour, but I did not want to take a chance. The tour was $10, and no park pass was needed to get into the park itself. There is a cafe next to the visitors center where we got hot chocolate and coffee to go, and they also offered sit down menu service. Prices were reasonable. After our tour, we did walk down to the natural entrance, which you can walk into for a short distance without having a tour. Be aware that this entrance requires many steps down and back up.","January 12, 2012","Great Visit, choose your tour in advance",154,"Los Lunas, New Mexico",5
Mammoth Cave,"I grew up in Kentucky, but never got to see this as a kid. My wife and I went back last year with our elementary age children, and had a wonderful time. I was most impressed by the park ranger who led our tour. Park Service rangers are almost always good, but this one was great. He told us just enough detail to make it fascinating. The caves themselves are amazing to see. I expect it would be a hard tour if you have a physical infirmity, but for a family with small kids, it was fine. They especially liked it in the room where the ranger turned off all the lights and it was pitch black. One of our nation's true natural wonders, you should see this at least once in your life.","January 8, 2012",A Must-Do....What an amazing place to see.,75,"St. Petersburg, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"Had fun, was interesting and awesome place to see being so large.Cons: needs better lighting for better camera shots and our tour guide rushed through the tour... We were last in the line and things were explained and such without us knowing what we were seeing or had seenWe still had fun though :)","January 7, 2012",Fun active thing to do,14,,4
Mammoth Cave,"A member of our party had concerns their 9 year old would not be able to ""handle"" the moderate tours but after being assured by the rangers that they had taken kindergarteners on these tours, we finally were able to convince them to go on ""New Entrance Tour"". Everyone liked the steep stairs you go down at this enterance.....exiting is another way with more gradual incline. You don't have to be a gym rat or super fit to handle this tour and was just the right amount of time for us to feel we had gotten a taste of it.","January 7, 2012","Unless you have a medical condition, atleast do a moderate tour",110,"Columbus, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"If you're planning a visit, it is definitely worth it to go online to book your tour in advance. Tours fill up and are not always offered. The Historic Tour is a great overview to the cave, but can be quite a large group (100+). The Grand Avenue Tour was great, but requires a longer commitment. Eating in the cave is fun, but the food is just okay. My young adult son and his girlfriend did the Wild Cave Tour and loved it! Definitely one for the physically fit!","January 7, 2012",Worth a Stop,45,"Sioux Falls, South Dakota",5
Mammoth Cave,"We arrived at Mammoth Cave in the afternoon. We got on an afternoon tour that started at the remote entrance to the cave called the ""new entrance."" Those of us on the tour got on a bus, and after a short drive arrived at the entrance. The ranger unlocked the door, and we had a terrific tour of that section of the cave. The next morning, we got on an tour that started at the regular entrance. That's when we saw how HUGE the cave is. We explained to the ranger that we have a relative who's name is supposed to be written on the ceiling, and the ranger said she would see what she could do. Well she somehow got information from other staff -we figured she must have had the ranger that was at the tail end of our tour group phone or walkie talkie back to the office to get the information regarding the location we wanted to see. It was great! We saw bats, and huge caverns from the standard entrance. It was amazing to see the cave from two different perspectives.","January 5, 2012","Mammoth Cave - two tours, two views",22,"Minnetonka, Minnesota",4
Mammoth Cave,"Was a little apprehensive having just been to Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico and was afraid nothing could come even close. I was wrong.Mammoth Cave is very different from Carlsbad so I wasn't comparing them - just enjoying Mammoth. The ""rooms"" are massive, hence the name. When the guide told us that there were 150 steps to climb at the end to get out, I almost didn't go - bad knees..but I decided to give it a try.Very glad I did, the steps are like a fire tower so you climb a few and have a platform to rest on. I made it without any problem. The guide was knowledgeable and the group was smallish which made for an interesting two-hour tour. Lots of history there, mining was done there and there is a display of how it was done.The story of the slave who explored much of it and guided many people there is fascinating. Not to be missed.

Mammoth Cave,"We've wanted to take a trip to Mammoth Cave for awhile, but it's in Kentucky and a bit of a drive for us (from Chicago). However, we stayed in French Lick (French Lick Resort) and drove down for the day for 2 two hour tours (one in the morning (New Entrance) and one in the afternoon (Old Entrance). I've heard a lot about the caves and didn't know what to expect.WOW! The tour guides really know their stuff and were great about answering questions. The Old Entrance is by far the BEST! We got to see a lot of artifacts from 1812 war, 19th century graffiti, and just the sheer size of the cave (hence, mammoth cave). The tours were not difficult to take. We and our 10 year old didn't have any difficulty walking on the tour. The are many steps to take both down and up and I LOVED fat man's misery and tall man's misery.This is one of those places that you MUST visit at least once in your life. I enjoyed myself so much that I wouldn't mind going back to take some of the other tours. My only regret is that we only did a 1 day trip. Looking back, I would've gone for 2 days.","December 28, 2011",WOW! What a wonderful excursion!,21,Chicago,5
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave National Park is one of the most interesting places I have seen in my life. We have attended a tour to see a part of the cave system. The number of stairs was just fine for our 5 years old son. The tour took 2 hours and it was amazing. The guide was a funny and knowledgable guy. I will never forget the level of darkness when the guide was turned off the lights in the cave. That was the ultimate darkness and your eyes will never get used to that darkness. If you have watched some documentaries about caves (like the ""planet earth from BBC; the episode on caves"" you will be familiar with the habitat inside the case such as the fishless eye and bats. The guy mentions those animals but I recommend you to see such documentaries before you visit there because that will increase your enthusiasm to see Mammoth Cave (although you do not see those animals during those tours)","December 19, 2011",a very different experience,1,"Columbus, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"We stopped at Mammoth Cave on a trip from Nashville to Indianapolis. We had about 2 hours to spend on a tour but this was no problem as there are a number of different tours of varying lengths to different parts of the cave. Mammoth Cave is the longest cave in the world and we were very impressed by it. Beautiful formations to see and a very knowledgeable guide to answer questions. The cave can be a bit claustrophobic but no one on our tour had any problem. Also, some parts are a bit narrow with one entitled ""Fat Man's Misery"" being the most truthfully named area on our tour.Highly Recommended!","November 27, 2011",A great National Park to visit!,261,"Cottage Grove, Minnesota",5
Mammoth Cave,"I love this cave! But not only is the cave exciting so are the hiking trails. There is a trail called Cedar Sink trail I believe? I highly recommend this hike. The trail goes over to a huge sink and you can see many different aspects of the sink because it is accessible with stairs from top to bottom. You can see a spring that leads down to the underwater cave system on both ends. The water level always changes which makes it exciting to hike this trail each time you visit. We also hike up at the visitors center. There is a trail head up past the cabins that goes above a bend where you can see the green river, very scenic here. Then the trail leads down to a beautiful spring that you can hike to the end with an observation deck. Here you can see the water level. It is called river styx spring.","November 26, 2011",Been coming here since I was a kid and still new things to explore!,29,,5
Mammoth Cave,"This felt less touristy than some other caves I have seen over the years - the guide was a local kid who knew quite a bit about the area and the cave and the building you start the tour in is kind of cool. Reasonably priced and I found online coupons that saved us even more money. The tour was fairly easy (some are a little more strenuous) and, if you've never been in a cave before, it really is breathtaking.","November 20, 2011",Better than other touristy caves,18,Playa Zancudo,4

Mammoth Cave,"Mammouth Cave is a really pretty resort area. Nice park, nice lodge, nice restaurants, nice amenities. We went for the tour this time - we have stayed before. It was Halloween weekend so we decides to take the lantern tour thinking it would be appropiately creepy. Tour guide was pleasant but very talky with historical facts - we like stories but these were kind of endless and not so entertaining. Also, although it said strenuous - that was understating - the trail is very slippery, very poor with the hand rails and stairs and I've got to be honest just not that good of a tour. Historically accurate with lanterns only but you can't see the cave so it really isn't the best tour available - go for probably any other tour and you will be happy. We've taken a few and this was the first time we left disappointed.","November 18, 2011",Pay attention to which tour you take,25,"Indianapolis, Indiana",3
Mammoth Cave,"I was very nervous about going into this cave but, after the jitters stopped it was very exciting. Unbelievable what water can do to the underground.

Mammoth Cave,"Our time in the area being limited, my husband and I booked the basic Frozen Niagara tour. Our tour included about 12 people, being the last tour of the day. One couple brought their 3 year old son and an infant. The cave tour is probably wonderful - the guide appeared to be very friendly and knowledgeable. Not that I heard anything he said. The infant cried and the little boy talked throughout the tour. ( And he had THAT mom. You know her - you've thought scathing things about her in line at WalMart. Typical loud exchange - "" Mom! Mom!Mom! I wanna touch that thing!"" "" No, Ethan, the cave is very delicate. We can't touch it or it will hurt the cave. We like the cave, don't we? We don't want to hurt the cave, do we? No we don't!"" Kid touches stalactite anyway.) And no, my husband and I weren't the only people annoyed by being unable to hear the guide.Mammoth Cave was beautiful and very interesting to see, but I would have liked a little information about the things I was seeing. I really think the NPS should consider providing a special tour for families with young children - geared toward young children. Better for them, better for the people who would prefer NOT to take the tour with them. ( And to the parents who brought the infant and 3 year old to the last cave tour on November 9, 2011 - both of your children are beautiful. Your son is absolutely adorable. His behavior is completely appropriate to his age. You, however, have quite a bit to learn about proper manners and consideration of others...)","November 10, 2011",Need to have separate tours for those with very young children.,27,Texas,3

I wouldn't say that it was the best experience I had but I am so glad I saw it. I am a bit claustrophobic and honestly I was not affected by that while I was there.

We two, not especially active, seniors were able to do two tours rated moderately difficult - the History Tour and the New Entrance tour - on the same day. The History tour left us a little winded in its final moments because it ended with many, many consecutive steps, but no one hurried us and we recommend both.

Day two we went on horseback with Double J Stables on the Collie Ridge Trail for a two hour trail ride, then later did the ""Historic"" cave tour (we learned SO much on this one), a quick walk to Sand Cave, then more stuff outside the park. Our guides were great. I have a friend that has been here before, so I knew to check schedules, buy tickets in advance, etc, but going in an ""off season"", I was still able to rearrange our tour schedule with ease. There is so much more to see and do, so we will definitely be back! My advice is to figure out everything you want to do, then call the businesses and compare those available times to the times on your seasonal Mammoth Cave schedule.

Mammoth Cave,"Never been in a cave quite like Mammoth. Huge and none of the typical formations. About a 2 mile hike underground. You can't take any bags, backpacks, pouches or purses with you. There are some very narrow passages so no stoller would fit either. The park rangers are very knowledgeable and always interesting. The NPS took measures to protect the cave and the bats inside from a fungal disease that has showed up in other caves. They have a sanitized mat that everyone walks on when they leave the cave. We did the Historic tour which did contain a fair amount of steps. Had a fun time and would recommend to those who enjoy natural wonders.","October 20, 2011",Unique experience,57,Terre Haute,4

Mammoth Cave,"This is more of an informative review based on ""what to do"" before you get there. Number one and foremost is Do Your Homework! We took my 91 year old Dad to see the caves because it was his wish to do so. I looked over the website and found two tours offered that were considered ""easy."" At that point I should have purchased tickets (but did not) and I should have printed out the Fall Schedule (but did not). I suggest you do both! Also, before you go, I would check a milage guide (on the web, which I did) and calculate the approximate time it will take you to drive from your starting point to the caves. From there, add on at least 30-45 minutes (which I didn't) for parking, discussing tour options with a ranger, buying a ticket (if you do not have one), and a bathroom call. FYI: The caves sit back from the main highway about 7 miles. We traveled from Nashville and by the time (10:30-ish) we arrived the EASY Tour (only one offered) was at 9:45 AM and again at 4:30 PM. We were too late for the one and far, far too early for the other. Many of the other tour times were filled and were not really do-able for us with all of the stair climbing, etc. One male ranger felt sorry for us, I guess, and said that they MIGHT add on another tour at 12:45, but it was not announced so far and he could not guarentee that. Needless to say, we did not tour the caves and the opportunity to do so now is slim. So, I am giving the Mammouth Caves a 5 and for myself (a seasoned traveler who should have known better) a 1. Since school had started, I thought visitors would be at a minimum. That is not the case. Far too many people out there do not have school-age children or otherwise. A site does not become a National Park for nothing. So do your homework and plan well enough in advance, covering all angles and you should have a wonderful experience.","October 14, 2011",Do Your Homework before you go to Mammoth Caves,143,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",5
Mammoth Cave,"I took my 9 and 11 year old boy to Mammoth cave to do the ""Trog"" tour. It is only for 8 to 12 year olds if I'm remembering correctly. They suit up in coveralls that are provided by the park and then get hardhats and head lights. They had a blast with about eight other kids and two young rangers leading the way. It was a good long tour with some crawling on your belly but not so much that you get scared. While they were on that, my wife and I took a couple shorter tours with our three year old girl. Some of the stair climbing was a bit much for her. She'll enjoy it more if we come back in a few years. They do a good job keeping everyone well informed on what's going on in the park at the visitor center. All and all a delightful trip.","October 11, 2011",Trog tour was awesome,6,South Bend,4
Mammoth Cave,"The visitor center in Mammoth Cave is tucked back in the woods of central Kentucky along winding roads. There are plenty of hiking options before reaching the visitor center. We visited the park in late August (2 weeks before Labor Day; not crowded at all and no lines to get tickets) while the new center was still under construction. It appears to be 50% complete and based on what was done already it should be a very nice center once it is complete. We went on the New Entrance tour. This tour requires a bus ride to get to the entrance of the tour (a large metal door deep in a sinkhole) and another ride to return to the visitor’s center. There are a few tight spots where you need to duck, twist, or turn sideways, but they are all on the initial descent into the cave. After the initial stairway is complete the cave opens up. We stayed in the back of the tour and were able to get better pictures without the crowd around.We would certainly go again to take another tour if in the area.","October 9, 2011",Excellent National Park,94,,5
Mammoth Cave,"I tent camped a couple of nights at the Mammoth Cave Campground in the first week of August 2011 with my two teen sons. The camp ground was immaculately clean. Too bad the overnight low temps were in the mid 80's--wow it was hot and humid! The camp sites are set up with a gravel base to pitch your tent upon. That was fine as I use a heavy tarp under the tent anyway. It was H*** trying to pound the tent stakes in and I wrecked a couple of them in the process of driving them in to the gravel.The campground has a store and showers that are not run by the National Park Service but rather a private business. The store has a nice variety of items much like any convenience store. The showers are not so great. They require a $1.00 token for about a 10 minute shower. This is not too bad but the showers were not clean and they are very small. I am not a big person and the shower seemed tight. If you are a heavy person, you would hardly be able to turn around very easily. The other issue with the showers is that couples were using the them on a regular basis. Every time we went to use the mens shower, a young couple would be in there. Things to do include the various cave tours of course and then fishing in the Green River was good. We did the Grand Central Ave tour and enjoyed it. Why did we choose that tour? Because that was all that was left. I did not know so I am telling you, during peak season make reservations ahead of time for the tour you would like. I'm assuming this would primarily be an issue during peak season like we were in.We fished at both ferry crossings and had good luck with some very large pan fish. I caught a couple of bluegills that didn't fit in my hand. And btw, you do not need a fishing licence to fish within the park. It was so blasted hot when we were there that one night I couldn't take it anymore so about 9 PM we went in to town and had treats at Dairy Queen. Roughing it by tent camping only goes so far! :)","October 4, 2011",Mammoth Cave National Park and Campground was very nice,25,"Janesville, Wisconsin",4

Mammoth Cave,"Went to mammoth caves in ky. The area is nice and the caves are great for what they are.These caves are great but not the typical cave with stalactites and stalacmites. They are large open area caves that go deep underground. There are several different tours and we went on the easy ones, well 2 of them anyway. One was about an hour and a half and the other was about 2 hours. The rangers were the guides and they were great. They told stories about the caves and their own families who have lived there for generations. Even though there were not a bunch of stalactites and mites we loved the area and the caves and would recommend it highly.  m","September 23, 2011",Not your typical caves,22,none,5
Mammoth Cave,"We took the 4.5 hour Grand Avenue Tour in Mammoth Caves, rated very strenuous. Unless you have little to no physical fitness, it was not strenuous at all. You are walking less than a mile an HOUR (it was hard for us to walk that SLOW). Nevertheless, it was very enjoyable....the paths were mostly super smooth and easy to walk. There were some steeper areas and stairs, but handrails were there to make sure you didn't slip. Mammoth Cave is not filled with lots of interested stalagmites and stalagtites...more like huge boulders...but was very interesting and worthwhile. There IS one area called Frozen Niagara that does have some great formations. Our guide Jennifer, was a WEALTH of knowledge....there wasn't a question she couldn't answer. You can stop for lunch 1 hour in...but I have to say, I thought the box lunch was pretty bad (my husband says I am a prima donna). You can bring your own lunch in a see through plastic or mesh bag. When I get my NERVE worked up, I'm coming back for the wild cave tour, where you are crawling on your belly in holes that look like only a gopher should go through them.I recommend Mammoth Cave Nat'l Park for families and couples.","September 22, 2011",Mammoth Cave Nat'l Park - definitely worth a visit,187,"Nashville, Tennessee",4
Mammoth Cave,"We went as a mini vacation for the kids (ages 10 and 12) before school started back. We all loved it! The tours are so interesting and educational and there were even very small children who seemed to be really enjoying themselves. The only problem we ran into was the tours we had decided we wanted to take were sold out by the time we got there. We still ended up getting to see almost everything on our list on different tours though, so it all worked out. I would suggest if you are going and know which tours you want to take that you book them in advance. Some of the tours (like the ones late in the evening, only one time a day) book up more than a month in advance. Overall it is a great place to go for a visit and we will definitely be going back!! Also, the cave stays around 50 degrees so you might want to bring a light jacket.","September 21, 2011",Great place for family!,0,salyersville,5
Mammoth Cave,"Very cool, the tour guide was very entertaining and very knowledgeable. There are so many cool things to see underground it this cave system. There are all kinds of signatures on some of the walls 100 or more years ago. Very temp in the cave was kind of low which was ok in that it being July.

Mammoth Cave,"I had wanted to visit Mammoth Cave for many years and planned our vacation around it.The park and facilities around the cave were very nice.There were two places to eat while we waited for our timed cave tour.We opted for the smaller cafe and the food was excellent and I felt reasonably priced.There are also gift shops to look through while you wait.There are a variety of tours to choose from with different prices and levels of difficulty.We had our kids with us and opted for the Mammoth Passage Tour, it is considered EASY but does have 160 stairs round trip.The $5.00 per person (6-12yrs are $3.50) fee was reasonable for the 3/4 mile 1hour15min. guided tour,but we were very dissappointed with the cave.It is a dry cave (no stalagtites,no stalagmites,no beautiful formations of any kind).It was like walking through a mountain.Yes it was very big inside but nothing spectacular to look at in our opinion.It is chilly year round(50 degrees) in the cave so bring a lightweight jacket.It is also my opinion that if you have children under six who are easily bored or can't be quiet PLEASE do not bring them here.The tour guide does alot of talking and because there can be as many as 40 people on this tour it is difficult to hear,especially with small bored children in the group.We had a women that was alone with 3 kids under 5 that made it an unpleasant experience.It is not handicapped accessable.You can take still pictures,but no video taping.You are not allowed to bring in camera bags,diaper bags,purses,or bags of any kind.If you are going on a weekend it is recommended that you reserve and pay for your tour ahead of time as they do sell out quickly.Everyone has to walk on a disinfecting mat at the end of the tour because of White Nose Syndrome which is killing bats in Kentucky(I recommend you wear athletic shoes).Overall I would still recommend going if you are passing through the area or camping in the park and there are alot of other cave tours in the area.","September 15, 2011",NICE BUT NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,13,"Brook Park, Ohio",3

Mammoth Cave,We really enjoyed our tour of the Frozen Niagara. Our tour guide was great giving information and engaging the children in the group. The tour itself was fairly easy which is great for children and grown-ups with bad knees (LOL). We are already planning a trip back next year.For those you don't know our National Parks offer a Junior Ranger program for kids of all ages. Most parks are free but some charge a small fee to cover the cost of the badge they give out. In Yellowstone it was $3 and we got a really nice patch to keep. The kids get a booklet of activities and based on their age have to complete a certain number of those activities. It is totally up to the kids and the parents which ones to do. Once they are done they get either a patch or a pin to collect. My boys love this. It is a great way to learn about out National Parks. I would recommend it to anyone with children.,"September 12, 2011",Loved it,12,"Columbus, OH",5
Mammoth Cave,"My family decided Labor Day weekend we would go to Mammoth Cave. We had never been so thought we would like to see as much as possible while there. They offer a 4.5 hour Grand Avenue Tour. After much research I got mixed reviews about it. Some say not that bad, others said tough but manageable. It was myself (no health but but fairly in good shape), my husband (coal miner - he was good to go), 2 teenagers (full of energy), and my uncle (total work -out nut = excellent shape). The first two miles are a cake walk then the last two just about did us all in. The tour itself has 670 stairs, a couple of (what I would call) ladders to climb, and mulitple steep hills. Slick to climb due to the sand on the floor. We ended up near the back so all those in front of us kept stopping to take pictures which caused us to play catch-up the entire tour. I honestly felt like I was rushed thorugh the entire tour. Had it been a slower pace and you got to look around and actually take in the vastness of the cave it would have been great. But honestly once you seen the first bit it becomes a repeat. I would definitely take a shorter tour next time. I could never describe how big it is - def. worth seeing, but VERY TOUGH TOUR.","September 11, 2011",Grand Avenue Tour = Challenging.,15,Kentucky,4
Mammoth Cave,"We took our family to Mammoth Caves on the way back to MI from Hilton Head. We had seen Ruby Falls in Chattanooga, TN the day prior. I was worried my adventure driven, adrenaline filled kids (12, 10 and 7) would not enjoy the caves, but was pleasantly surprised to find they all enjoyed the experience. Word of warning: DO NOT BRING BAGS/food to Mammoth Caves. If you do, leave them in your car because you can't take them in with you. So if you're travelling with DS's or iPods/iPads and are concerned about leaving them in the car, don't bring them here. You can try to get a locker when you get there, but it is a pain. Plan ahead and leave your valuable stuff in a hotel safe. Leave your bags/backpacks/purses in the car. I would suggest bringing a lunch to leave in the car if you're choosing back-to-back tours. The food at Mammoth Caves was sooo not worth the money. The hot dog, chicken fingers, burger and salad we ate were all not particularly good. A smashed PB&J that sat in a hot car all day under my smelly shoes would've been way better than what we ate. Just sayin'.In the morning, most of our group (and the kids) went thru the New Entrance Tour. This tour is really spectacular, even for the kids. The stairs to descend into the cave are an engineering feat, you get to see interesting formations on the way down the stairs, at the bottom you sit in what seems like a half a football field sized cavern in the bowels of the cave and experience total darkness (must've been creepy for the early cavers,) and as you exit you get to see some of the more pretty formations this area has to offer ('bacon' and such.) Mammoth Caves is just that--mammoth. In these caves, you don't go for spectacular crystal or stalagmite/stalactite formations. You go for 392 miles (+/-) of passageways and huge, underground spaces. I had seen the New Entrance Tour on a previous visit to Mammoth Caves, so I chose to go on the Historic Tour. It was 54 degrees on this tour. Brrr. The New Entrance tour wasn't nearly as cold as this cave. You definitely need a sweatshirt/jacket on this one. I found the information about the salt peter mining, sanctioned 'cave graffiti' from old times, relics of folks that used to live/traverse the caves, and use of the caves as a hospital to be interesting. This is, after all, the 'historic' tour. Fat Man's Misery was a fun, but very brief section, of crawling thru tighter passages in the cave. The ""rooms"" you get to see in this cave are truly massive. That alone made this tour interesting to me. That said, the kids would've been bored out of their mind on this tour. As evidenced by:Later that night we took the Star Chamber tour. This is one of those tours you HAVE to get tickets for before you arrive. It ALWAYS sells out. This tour takes you thru many of the places you go on the Historic Tour (minus Fat Man's Misery) but it takes you there via lantern light like the early cavers experienced these caves. I loved this tour for that bit of nostalgia and it made it a bit more romantic, if you will. The cave looked totally different by lantern light than it did all lit up by the bulbs I saw it by during the Historic Tour. We did take the kids on this tour. They were all mad at us in the morning for making them wear long pants for the New Entrance Tour and they said they weren't cold. They put shorts on (against my warnings that the Historic Tour was super cold that morning) and they FROZE the whole tour. When we stopped to listen to the guide, I had kids sucked to my side trying to pull what little body heat I had out of me. They did not appreciate the history the guide shared with them and were bored at times. (In their defense, they are not museum kids. They're more the active type.) They DID, however, think it was very cool to go on the tour with the lantern. It was a different perspective on the caves for them and they liked experiencing what the early cavers did. They enjoyed the New Entrance much more than what the Historic Tour had to offer. The website says to bring a flashlight to this tour. You can't use the flashlight at all during the tour, it's really only to help you get back to your car once the tour is over. In Mammoth Caves, you're not allowed to bring bags at all, so hauling flashlights for the whole family is really unnecessary. When you get out of the caves, you already have good night vision from being in the dark for a long while. If you choose to bring any flashlight, one would be more than sufficient.","September 11, 2011",The caves are magnificent! New Entrance vs Historic,67,"Bloomfield Hills, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"We took the New entrance tour and this was relatively easy with our children, even the 4 year old girl with us was able to do it and enjoyed it. There are some tight passages and so i suggest staying next to the guide at the front if you suffer from claustrophobia as I do!The caves are amazing and the tour guide was very entertaining, the 2 hour length was just right for us.

Mammoth Cave,"Was part of a group of nine 30-something women who did the Historic Tour of the cave. It was so much fun. We were a bit scared of the advertised 400 stairs (and we're all in pretty good shape) but it wasn't that bad--many of the stairs go down, as opposed to up, and they're spread out over the 2-mile walk. In fact, one girl with us was 7 months pregnant and she did great on the tour (she said the hardest part was the uphill walk at the end of the tour, outside the cave, where it was 95 degrees). The cave is a delightful 54 degrees inside--definitely wear workout pants and bring a light jacket. The best part of the tour was our guide, Rick. A grizzled gentleman in his 50s or 60s, with a long beard and a voice made for NPR, he brought the history of the cave to life. I would recommend calling the cave and finding out what tours he's doing the day you want to go--he's THAT GOOD. He was one of the best guides I've ever had on any tour. I would have tipped him really well had we not had to leave our purses in the car! (They don't allow any purses, backpacks, camera cases, etc. in the cave at all. And it was quite a long walk from the car to the cave.)There were several small children on the tour, and having a 4-year old and a one-year old myself, I would not recommend the tour for kids that age. I would say a child needs to be at least 6 or 7. At one point they turned off all lights in the cave to let us see how totally dark it is, and there isn't a whole lot to look at (it's not a ""show cave,"" no stalagtites or formations), so the main attraction is the history and the storytelling, plus it was a long walk for little ones. Strollers and such are physically not allowable due to the stairs and tight spaces, and even a Baby Bjorn or similar carrier would have been quite hard to do with the occasional bending and duck walking. Anyway, we all had a great time, even the more ""girly"" among us, so I would recommend to anyone who is in decent shape to do the Historic Tour, especially if you can get Ranger Rick as your tour guide!

Mammoth Cave,"A visit to the cave is a great idea during the heat of summer, since it stays cool there. I think they over-emphasize the physical requirements, but they're probably being cautious. I'm physically active and had no problem completing the Grand Tour. If you walk or run regularly, you'll have no problem, and I swear time slows down there. It felt like we'd only been there maybe two hours at the most. They have short intro tours, so if you're not sure you're up to the walk and the stairs, start with the intro tours. Also, I noticed that the booking information on the web site isn't quite in sync with what's going on at the park. For example, the morning we went, the web site showed certain tours being sold out, but when we got there, they weren't even close to being sold out. So don't rely on the web site.

However I would say they are worth a drive if you are staying in the vicinity but do take the Historical 2 hour tour. I dont think the one hour tour would offer enough and the 2 hours does go quickly. Its classified a tour of moderate exhertion but we found it a doddle..in saying that we are fit. We noted that alot of the others on the tour struggled with the steps towards the end of the tour and never got their breath back!....however they all made it, and really there are not a lot of steps so dont be put off. The guides are great and very knowledgeable. !!If you are staying in Bowling Green go the back route (route 101 then onto 259) via a town called Pig. We stopped in Pig at the Porkey Pig Resturant. (dont blink or you will miss it!) . This place is very basic..very!.a real taste of""back country America"" but boy do they make an excellent Cheeseburger!

Mammoth Cave,"We just got back from a trip to Mammoth Cave. We took two tours while there- New Entrance and Snowball Tour. It was my husband, our 81/2 year old son and myself. We absolutely loved the New Entrance tour and my son pronounced it ""very cool!"" You get to see both the wet and dry areas of the Cave, both vertical and horizontal parts of the cave and of course the breathtaking Frozen Niagara section at the end along with a brief glimpse of Crystal Lake. The tour was fascinating and the guide both witty and informative. One family brought a one year old that screamed the entire time and they struggled carrying him up and down the steps at the beginning. So I don't recommend very young children (although why anyone would bring a child that young anyway is beyond me since neither the child, the parents nor anyone else on the tour was enjoying themselves as a result). The tour is about 2 hours of walking, mostly easy and it is amazing how beautiful limestone can be. The second tour we took was the Snowball tour. This was very different. It was all part of the dry cave area and other then the steps at the very beginning and end, a very horizontal tour. You are basically walking through a tunnel to the Snowball Cafe where you eat lunch in the cave like they have done for decades. This tour is chilly so definitely dress accordingly. And the food served is both overprices and subpar so I would recommend bringing your own sandwiches. You do get to see some of the crevices that the Wild Tour people crawl through and it is mindboggling how small some of them are. The tour guide was informative but the biggest problem (other than the food) is that you come out the same way you came in so you really aren't seeing that much of the cave. Highly recommend New Entrance but not Snowball. Both of these tours fill up so book in advance!","August 18, 2011",One Great Tour. . . one not so much.,7,"Cincinnati, Ohio",4

Mammoth Cave,"My family took two tours:Mammoth Cave New Entrance: The two hours begins when you get on the bus to ride to the entrance, so you are underground a bit less than two hours but that isn't a problem as the time underground was both interesting and fun! Our tour-guide/ranger was a native Kentuckian whose great personality made the tour very enjoyable - hat's off to Ranger Shannon! The tour begins at a man-made door in the side of the mountain (the story about how it got there is explained during the tour) - and you immediately begin your descent. The tour description is no lie - stairs, stairs and more stairs. Fortunaately all 500 are not in the same place! While Mammoth Cave doesn't have as many beautiful formations as some other caves/caverns, my family was astounded by the shear size of it. Though this tour only covers a small piece of it, you get a sense of the enormity. The formations at the Frozen Niagara/Drapery Room are the prettiest on this tour. Photos are allowed but hard to get a good one unless you have an expensive camera that shoots well in low light. If you want photos they have a lot to sell in cards and books in the gift shop. I recommend this tour.Mammoth Cave Historic: This tour begins in one of the original nature-formed openings in the earth. The most startling thing is the cold air that comes out to meet you. I recommend a long-sleeved shirt or sweater to wear, even in summer, as the air temperature in the cave is always about 54 degrees F. You won't see a lot of formations on this tour, but it really gives you an idea of the enormity of the Mammoth Caves. The walk goes through several expansive underground chambers, some as big as a large arena, then also through some pretty tight squeezes (Fat Man's Misery, anyone?) but overall is a fantastic cave tour that I recommend if you want to experience some of Mammoth Cave.","August 15, 2011",A fun part of our family vacation,20,"Weaverville, NC",4
Mammoth Cave,"To get the best tours, schedule them ahead of your arrival via the internet. We missed several tours we would have liked to take. Also one cave, off park, not to be missed is Diamond caverns. It is only 5 miles away and has the best formations. The rooms at the park hotel were comfortable the restaurant good (avoid the daily specials) and we felt very safe even on evening walks in the park. Again book your hotel room ahead. The park is best enjoyed Mon thru Fri, on weekends it can get crowded.","August 15, 2011",ENJOYED OUR STAY,21,niceville,4
Mammoth Cave,"We took the Historical tour and were really disappointed with the guide -- he never actually told us anything. I think the group was too big. By the time everyone caught up at a stopping point, he would say ""Any questions?"" and then ""Time to go"". So, got some random pieces of information in response to questions, but no coherent story. I've had much better National Park tours in other places. We also did the New Entrance tour -- underground sights were much more interesting and the guide was more informative.","August 14, 2011","Caves are spectacular, tours leave a lot to be desired.",12,"Boston, Ma",4
Mammoth Cave,"There are really few words that can describe Mammoth Cave itself, especially words that haven't already been said before. But the park is greater than the sum of its parts. The cave is one thing -but then there's the languid Green River, the many settlements, churches, and cemeteries dotted around the park region, the hiking trails, and the wildlife all combine to make an unforgettable trip. August and September are horrendously hot in southern Kentucky, but that makes the adventure all the more interesting. I remember hiking back from visiting the old steamboat landing on the Green River, the sweat soaking my shirt in 95-degree heat... and then I stopped in front of the Historical Entrance to the cave and the cool air coming up from the mouth of the cave made me stop and take it in. I must have spent 30 full minutes just cooling off and enjoying the outflow of air from the cave. Unforgettable memories.","August 13, 2011",Unforgettable memories,21,"West Grove, Pennsylvania",5
Mammoth Cave,I stopped by Mammoth Cave on the way to see relatives. They have cut the amount of tours to one half to protect the bats. It seems people are bringing in spores from the outside and bats are dyiing. I booked the Latern Tour 5 months in advance. My kids loved the tour but I did not care for being in darnkness for 3 and half hours. My kids wanted to wear crocks but I made them change to jeans and tennis shoes and they were glad. It was not an easy hike. We had switch back trails that went straight up and many stairs to climb. You do not see stalagtites or stalagmites until the end. They mainly show writing on the walls and tell old stories. I think we walked 4 miles and a bus picked us up at the end and took us back to where we started. My kids loved the tour but I think I will just wait in the store next time.,"August 13, 2011",Teenagers Loved the Lantern Tour!!!!,312,"Panama City Beach, Florida",5
Mammoth Cave,"We have visited many caves in the eastern US and this is a very unique place!Do your research ahead of time, understand that there is a fair amount of physical work needed to climb the steps and walk the paths. They have short, easy tours for those who are not up to the challenge of the long ones, and very difficult exploration tours for those who want to do real caving.The most popular tours may occasionally sell out, so it is worth it to book your tours ahead of time online or by phone.This is a Federally-operated park, so the tour prices are very reasonable (less expensive than any commerical caves) , but you can also expect large tour groups on many of the popular tours.We did the Historic Tour (2 hours) which was very informative, and the New Entrance Tour (2 hours), which was not as strenuous as expected as most of the stairclimbs were down. This tour ended with the Frozen Niagara Tour section (a separate tour available for those who don't want too many stairs) which is the only part of Mamoth caves we saw that had the typical wet cave limestone formations.Note that the temperature in the caves is in the low 50s, so if you are subject to chills, bring a sweatshirt - for us it was a blessed relief from the 90+ degrees outside each day!They tell you no 'packs or purses', etc, but you ARE allowed to bring bottled water (which they don't tell you), and the Historic Tour does have a bathroom stop about a half hour before the end (the New Entrance Tour does not).","August 12, 2011",A unique heritage location!,146,Massachusetts,5
Mammoth Cave,"We spent the night in Cave City and got up the next day to go to the park. The drive in is nice. We did not have reservations and decided to just go and see what happened. We arrived and it was no problem to get a tour. Here's the kicker. They allow up to 120 people on these tours. We had 76 our tour. We took the historic tour which was really informative and lead by a fascinating man whose great great grandfather was a slave explorer of the cave a long time ago. If you can get through the crowd and the obnoxious kids to hear what he has to say you will absorb a lot of knowledge. The issue is that these tours have really no age restrictions and parents often are not smart enough to make good tour choices. Seriously a three year old on a historic tour? A diaper full when you start the tour? So not really the parks fault but I would have paid double to have a smaller tour and a 12age and up restriction. We have kids too but we do not drag them on tours that are beyond their appreciation. So just prep yourself for this social dynamic. Other than that the place is fascinating and full of old tales. I will go back one day and take a more ""advanced"" tour. After the tour we ate Joe's Dinner which was about six miles back to the freeway.","August 11, 2011",Worth the stop.,152,"Marysville, Ohio",4
Mammoth Cave,"We are 50 yrs, (good shape) and 2 adults 25 years. We took the Grand Tour. It was very nice and worth the money! Good overall sampling of all the types of caves within the park. It was 4 hours and we handled it fine, but there were some young children and older adults on the trail and they were whining and huffing the 1st hour. The visitor center is VERY CLEAR on who should go and who should not and the length. I dont know why parents insist on taking young children on such a long and difficult tour. Also, take a jacket like they recommend. The 50 degree weather is very refreshing for the first 45 min or so, but then you just get downright cold if you dont have a jacket. There is not a alot more to do around this area unless you are into the caving and hiking. I would highly recommend taking some of the above ground hiking trails. Cedar Sink Trail is very nice, well maintained, and a wonderful suprise at the end where you can see parts of the underground cave river surfacing. We spent 1 day within the park visiting the churches, cemetery and above ground trails and had a great time. We stayed at the Sleep Inn and it was new and very clean and just fine for what we needed.","August 9, 2011",Reserve tour tix online & take the Cedar Sink Trail,30,"Batesville, Indiana",4
Mammoth Cave,"This is truly a piece of historical Americana.There are several tours to choose from..note: We used an on-line list for reservations, found that 3 were no longer available once we actually arrived at Mammoth Cave. The staff was very accomodating, and switched us to the Historical tour, which was ok. The descriptions of each tour were pretty accurate.(If it says strenuous, be ready for a bit of a workout.) Bathrooms on the tour were a definite plus with kids along. Would we go back? YesWe stayed overnight at Cave City, KY (just down the road) The Sleep Inn had just opened Aug 2010, and still had the new feel to it..Small indoor pool, but very nice, with friendly staff..","August 5, 2011",Very cool attraction !,19,"Indianapolis, Indiana",4
Mammoth Cave,"Meander through some of the 392 miles of passages under the Kentucky hills - it's hotter than blazes up top in the summer, but the cave is comfortably cool. We were lucky to be able to book a tour only a day in advance and discovered that many scheduled tours were already sold out, so plan ahead! Also, you MAY NOT bring any bags, purses, diaper bags, backpacks, etc. into the cave. This is serious business. Take a light jacket, your ID, a camera and a little money in your pocket - THAT'S IT.All access to the cave costs money - the longer the tour, the higher the prices. Our family of six did the ""New Entrance"" 2 hour guided tour for about $50 and also a less interesting 1 hour self-guided tour for an additional $17 just so we could cool off. We have teenagers and a preschooler and they all loved the guided tour. It took us straight down a LOT of stairs in narrow, rocky passages and then into an area where stalagmites and tites were breathtaking. There were 2 stops along the way with benches to sit on while the ranger/guide gave a short informative talk. The stair section was a little physically demanding and those with children under 5 seemed to have to combat boredom during the talks. Definitely a good option for families with school aged kids.","July 31, 2011",Above and below - a worthwhile US landmark to visit,47,"Wyoming, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"We stopped here twice; once while driving to Sanibel Island and then also on the way back. Mainly made the second stop we made because upon our first stop (a Saturday) all the tours were sold out! So our first stop, with just me and my 12 and 14 year olds was to do the self-guided very inexpensive 3/4 of a mile tour ""Mammoth Cave Discovery Tour"". Now, I figured from what the girl told me, this was NOT the best tour to go on but we didn't really have a choice. Plus my 12 yr old stepdaughter was a little spooked by the idea since she had never been in a cave, whereas me and my 14 yr old are accomplished spelunkers ;) So, this intro tour is perfect for small children or someone who may have difficulty walking long distances. It was perfect also for someone who might not be sure if they want to commit to something (such as my 12 yr old) that is too long or spooky. Having said that, I was surprised that this cave, compared to other caves we have seen in southern IN and MO does not have formations but rather is truly a ""cave"". I thought perhaps this was because we didn't take one of the other regular cave tours. So, on our drive back from Sanibel Island I pre-purchased tour tickets online (highly highly recommended!) as we had our choice of tours then! It appears the tours DO sell out ahead of time on the weekends so plan ahead! Personally, I wanted to do something kind of strenuous but the kids weren't so game (wimps ;) so I picked the ""Historic Tour"". Our tour guide ""Barbara"" kept my attention the entire time. You could tell that she not only knew her stuff, she truly enjoyed telling people about the cave, mining operations and history. She made the tour so worthwhile for me. Again, this tour (like the previous) did not include seeing much in the way of formations that I have seen in other caves. But I certainly could appreciate this cave for what it was. I was concerned that this would be too much walking for the kids but honestly the tour ended well before we were tired. The walk did not seem that long at all! It IS cool in the Cave so a light sweater or sweatshirt would be good to have, but the walking does kind of keep you warm. BTW, there is not constant walking on this guided tour. The tour stops several times for explanations and history so the pace is really not an issue for someone who may need to walk a bit slower. The ""Fat Man's Misery"" and other unique portions of the tour were really fun to do. This would be a great unique ""adventure"" for kids and adults alike! Also, I found the tour prices to be quite reasonable, considering it IS a tourist destination. There is very small fast-food place to purchase food, but beware-very limited selection and CASH ONLY! (who does cash-only?! especially at touristy places like this!) There WAS a sign advising of an ATM machine in the lobby however.There is also a gift shop but we managed to only buy a couple candies; there wasn't anything truly tempting to the kids. My 4 yr old stayed with my husband for both of these tours but he could have easily gone on the ""Discovery"" tour as that would not have been too strenuous. If I were to return, I would plan to go on one of the longer, more strenuous tours as I realize now the descriptions for the tours are a bit exaggerated in terms of difficulty (IMO) but it is probably better to be safe than sorry in that regard.","July 30, 2011",Amazing with interesting history-but plan ahead to get tickets!,35,"Wheaton, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"I always wanted to go to Mammoth Caves and finally had the opportunity to go. Not sure if it is worth a whole trip, but definitely worth it if you are in the area. Caves are amazing and our kids went through a Junior Park Ranger workshop while we were waiting for our tour. Tours are at different times and I saw that some were sold out so probably worth it to call or else you may have to wait a bit for your tour. There are three restaurants. Seems like fast food, coffee shop and fancier. We ate at the fast food - a bit overpriced, but what can you expect. If you have time and can handle the walking, go for one of the longer tours, you will not be disappointed.","July 30, 2011",Must see if you are in the area,45,"Naperville, IL",5
Mammoth Cave,"We visited on a Sunday in July. The park itself is huge. Miles of biking (gravel) trails, horse back riding trails, and walking trails. Didn't get to the camping facilities so can't comment on that. What can you say about Mammoth Cave? It's one of the 8 wonders of the world. There are numerous tours you can take. We did the historical tour, from start to finish is roughly 2 hrs. It's not real strenous so most people should be able to do this one. Wish we had time to have taken another tour, will have to go back and do a different one. There is a nice hotel onsite with 3 different resturants. I can see that a family could easily spend 2 full days here without boredom. Not living very far away we probably will go back and do a different tour before summer is gone.","July 29, 2011",Can't go wrong with one of the 8 wonders of the world,36,"Murfreesboro, TN",4

There are several different entrances to the caves and we went to two of them. We spent about 6 hours at the park. They shuttle you to the entrance to the caves. There is a gift shop, good free parking close to ticket area but not much food/drink places on site. We brought our lunch and sat outside at a picnic table to eat. Even though it was March- we had a very nice day. Very interesting and educational for children and adults!","July 28, 2011",Exceeded our expectations,28,"Savannah, Georgia",5
Mammoth Cave,"I always wanted to visit Mammoth Cave when I was a child and finally got the opportunity at 24 years of age! I was so glad I decided to go, as it proved worth the wait. We stayed a the campground in Mammoth Cave National Park, which was the best decision we could've made, as it made for a cheaper vacation and provided a great atmosphere. The campground was cheap, clean, secluded, and quiet, which is everything I ask for in a campground. The cave attraction itself was definitely worth the money. While the city itself on the outskirts of the national park has clearly declined in recent years with many businesses closed down, there was still plenty to keep us busy. We visited a Wildlife Museum that was actually a lot more fun than we thought it would be. The museum featured taxidermy animals and was definitely an old museum, but I ended up sharing a lot of laughs and taking a lot of photographs with my friend. The other cave attractions in the area are fun as well, and Bowling Green proved to be a lovely town to visit!","July 28, 2011",A great experience and a beautiful area,10,"Fort Wayne, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I went to Mammoth Cave in May, when I was about 12 weeks pregnant. I wasn't sure about going down in a cave while pregnant. However, the staff told me that it was safe, so we decided to do it. We had the best time exploring the cave! Our tour guide was great and was willing to answer any questions about the area, in addition to the cave. We took the New Entrance tour with about 500 stairs (mostly going down) over 1 1/2 to 2 hours. I was tired when we were done, but was worth it. I wouldn't suggest a 500 stair tour unless you are in average to good shape. My husband wants to go back at some point and take a tour off the beaten path (Wild Cave Tour). They offer these to smaller groups, but there are restrictions on size because some of the openings are really small.I also want to note that we checked the web site the night before we went and the web site indicated that all tours were booked for the day we wanted to go (but that they might add short self guided tours if they were busy). We decided to check it out anyway and we were glad we did. The tours were not sold out and there were a lot of choices. So I am not sure if the web site only sells a portion of the tours everyday or if they stop selling them a couple days in advance.","July 28, 2011",The views were amazing!!!,116,"Orlando, FL",5
Mammoth Cave,"We decided to stop by Mammoth on our drive down to FL from Chicago. It was a Friday-mid day. We had hoped to hop on a guided tour, but found that the next tours weren't until evening. So we did the self guided tour. It was fine. We got to go inside a cave. Bring a sweater b/c it's very cool inside the caves. Next time I would make a reservation online in advance, to be able to go on a guided tour. Alot atleast an hour for self guided and up to two hours for guided.","July 22, 2011",Make a reservation in advance!,32,"Chicago, Illinois",4
Mammoth Cave,We were amazed at the number of people at this cave. I had read the reviews that mentioned the crowds but there were a lot more people than we had expected. We didn't have reservations and had no trouble getting in on the new entrance tour. Our guide was a very nice ranger who in the winter is a concert pianist. She was very friendly and interesting. I am scared of heights and she told the lot of us that we were this wasn't for us. I went any way with my kids and wife. None of whom are scared of heights. She wasn't kidding. You enter down into the cave via 290 stainless steel steps that wind back and forth over themselves. You are descending stairs over (seemingly) bottomless cravasses and walking over them on stainless steel walkways. Not for the faint of heart. I honestly hated every minute of it but kept my cool for the sake of the kids and others. There are places where little ones could slip and fall into the depths of hell. One of the group asked the guide if anyone had ever died or fallen into the drop-offs. She answered that no one ever had. We didn't see how that was possible! Everyone loved the tour...but me!,"July 21, 2011",Beautiful Park and Wonderful Cave,41,Illinois,5
Mammoth Cave,"My family and I did the Grand Avenue tour. It is a four hour, four mile long hike. It was an exciting way to see the cave. We got to learn a lot about the people who toured in the 1920s, all while visiting almost every famous part of the cave. There are three rather large hills that we had to climb, but the guide always stopped at the top for those who needed it to catch their breath. One important note is that anyone who is claustrophobic, like me, should not do this particular tour (but should definitely visit the cave). We had to walk through a skinny portion of the cave for half an hour straight, along with several other occurrences of tiny spaces throughout the rest of the trip. I was on edge by the end by fear and discomfort, but still glad I did it because it was very pretty. Near the end of the ""trail"", we were allowed the option of climbing down 49 stairs to see a room with tons of stalactites. I'd highly recommend it; it was the most beautiful part of the tour!","July 20, 2011",Fun for all ages,24,Minnesota,5

Bring you flip flops, shower floors are wet and less that tidey at times with bugs and ""stuff"". Tiny space for changing as you enter shower by the way.. tight space for mom's with small kids. Park rangers are n ice, engaging and sem to monitor the camp area well. The park ranger talks that they sometimes give at dusk did not engage our family much and could be improved on.

Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I went to Mammoth Cave National Park mainly to see the Frozen Niagra that you frequently see in the ""100 wonders to see before you die"" books. We are avid hikers and in good shape. We thought we'd be able to explore at least part of the caves on our own, but that is not the case anymore. You cannot enter any part of the caves alone and the tour groups were pretty painful. They were filled with small children and elderly guests, which is expected at any national park, but we booked a tour that was listed as ""strenuous."" The guides repeatedly warned everyone that if you were not in good shape, if you could not hike a mile on uneven ground, or if you could not handle several hundreds of steps, this was not the tour for you. Not many people headed this warning and we walked a snails pace the entire two hours--except when we got to the end of the tour which was the ONLY really interesting part and the whole reason we took the tour--the formations. All the formations were at the end of the tour, including the Frozen Niagra. I could have crawled and kept up with this group, literally, but when we finally got the end, the guides decided to rush everyone through and out the cave door. It was very annoying. We were patient the entire two hours, we were the last ones in line because the guides said that the faster pace was in back, which was true.... and after being so patient and finally getting to the only formations, they pushed us out of the cave. Why wouldn't they start the tour at that end??? Also, i really feel like they need at least ONE tour where the guides can assess whether or not you are physically fit enough to go so that there is at least one tour that moves at a faster pace. This park ranks last on my list of National Park experiences. We planned on staying for four days, but left after one morning. I would advice going during the week, during the school year, to the earliest tour you can get on if you want to see it and cross it off your bucket list. To be honest, the formations were interesting, but not that spectacular--certainly not deserving of being in a book next to the pyramids or the Great Wall of China!","July 2, 2011",Interesting for about 30 mins - anti-group tour people beware,4,"Chicago, Illinois",2
Mammoth Cave,"We took two tours. The New Entrance tour is at the active end of the cave and it is humid inside the cave. We did not need a jacket at all. We took ours and we were hot. The cave is very nice with a lot of things to see inside. There are 280 steps down when you first enter the cave all with railings. You do not come back up the same way as you go in and the steps up are in smaller groups not to many at a time. Not bad at all, younger kids were on the tour and did fine. Two hours.We also took the Historic tour. That is a dry cave area. When you stand at the entrance you feel lots of cold air and we thought we made a mistake taking our coats to the car. But we were fine. You could take a light sweater if you want. Most people did not have coats on. This tour has a lot of big rooms and tunnels. There are a few narrow places like ""fat man's misery"" but it was not a problem at all. Not even close to a problem. When you enter there are a lot of steps and you do exit the same way. Two hours.If you go during the week there are not as many people taking tours. We did have reservations, but the tour was not full. I would recommend reservations though. Then you are sure. They are on central time so watch your time!If you like caves go see Cub Run Cave too. It is north of Mammoth on Hwy 88. Awesome cave only 14 steps and nice wooden walkways, lots & lots to see.

This is rated as a moderate tour and was fairly easy to walk through although you need to be able to bend down where the ceiling is low and shouldn't mind a lot of steps. The ranger walked quickly; however, there were periodic stops to look at attractions like Giant's coffin. We also went through fat man's misery.

The best choice was a Sleep Inn because it was brand new, so the facility was nice with a decent breakfast bar in the morning. There did not appear to be any really good restaurants in the area but good enough to get by. Don't go for the food or lodging. Go for the amazing spectacle the cave is!

I don't remember if there were tour guides when I went there as a kid (about 30 years ago) but I remember how I enjoyed it then as I did now. The Frozen Niagara has very few steps (only 12 with another optional 98). It was very neat. The Mammoth Passage tour was a bit more physical as it had a paved walkway going down to 69 steps to get into the cave, then you had to climb those same 69 steps and walk up the walkway. It was a nice tour, but we enjoyed The Frozen Niagara more. There are many more cave tours..we didn't have time to do more. The pamphlet you can get at a rest area or at the visitors station was very informative so you know what you are getting yourself into.

We'll definately go back to see the caves. There are many options, but allow yourself a day (we only had 1/2 a day). The restaurant was ok. Convenient, with simple food. The Ranger was great!The kids were a little hesitant (we don't camp or hike), but they loved it (ages 10 & 11). They can't wait to go back.","April 4, 2011",Very interesting.

Mammoth Cave,"We recently took the ""New Entrance"" tour of Mammoth Cave. While I thought it was really neat and I learned some interesting information, it wasn't quite what I expected it to be, although this is not necessarily a bad thing. I was looking for a good, long hike, it was not very strenuous and was shorter than I would have liked (some of you may think this is a good thing!). The distance was 3/4 mile, but there were lots and lots of rest breaks. The terrain was not difficult at all, aside from getting down the slippery stairs down to the bottom of the cave at the very beginning of the tour. The National Park Service describes this tour as ""moderate"" in difficulty, but I think it was still pretty easy. I think next time I will opt for a more strenuous, longer tour. It was definitely worth the visit, though! I would not recommend this tour for small children.","December 29, 2010",Neat and informative,8,Illinois,4

Mammoth Cave,"If you want a shorter tour through the caves, this is the tour for you. It only costs $10. and it's about an hour and 15 min. It isn't strenuous at all, the only exception to that is if you would like to take the steps down to view the under side of the falls, where there are 47 steps down and back up again.

Mammoth Cave,"Our family of six (kids ages 8-13) enjoyed our visit here. If you've seen Carlsbad caverns be prepared for a different experience...starting with no elevators and no self-guided tour options. We took the 4.5 hr Grand avenue tour, with a 5mile underground hike through most of the highlights except for the historical Natural entrance. The frozen Niagara area is the most beautiful. There is a 30 minute lunch break, with cash only box lunches for $7.50,drinks and snacks or you can bring your own food unclear ziploc bags (no purses, camera cases or bags of any other kind are allowed due to homeland security concerns). The current visitor center only has tour ticket sales (there are many shorter options and rservations are recommended for popular ones), a restroom, and small gift shop,but ugrades are in process.

Mammoth Cave,"My husband, myself, and our two young children went in July 2010. It was fantastic! We did the fairly simple cave exploration tour because of the children, but saw some really neat things. It was amazing to see how people had lived and explored the cave. There are miles and miles of cave that could be ventured by people in all walks of life. Just remember to dress accordingly. It's a cold, dark cave....take a jacket! And get there early to sign up. We will definitely go back many again once the kids are a little older to do a more serious tour.","November 8, 2010",A trip to remember! Family friendly!,6,"Murfreesboro, Tennessee",5
Mammoth Cave,"I loved the camp sites! They weren't deep in the woods, and everything was so close by and accessible. The bathrooms were immaculate (which wasn't expected at all). We loved camping over the weekend, taking some nature walks and hikes, having deer in our campsite and enough tree coverage. I loved that our neighbors weren't sitting on top of us, but if we wanted to play or borrow things it wasn't a big hike either. The Mammoth Cave was also very unique. It was our first time in a cave and we were not disappointed. There are so many tours to pick from, and even with our large group we were able to stop and take pictures and hear all the fun facts and history. We were warned beforehand that there are short areas and skinny areas, but we all made it out safe and sound! What a fun trip! It was worth the drive!","November 8, 2010",A Perfect Camping Experience!,0,"Gainesville, FL",4

Mammoth Cave offers several different tours ranging from very strenuous to easy. We went on one of the shorter, easier tours due to my mother's arthritis. It was great. The kids absolutely loved it! There are other activities near by (mini golf, go-carts, etc.). A great vacation. Highly recommended!

Mammoth Cave,"Our family of 4 stayed here in October 2010 for 2 days. Our only regret is that we could not stay longer. The cave tours are fabulous. Do several. If you go in the fall, the Great Onyx is very special. There is so much to learn here and their Junior Ranger program is very good compared to some other national parks. Besides the caves, there is excellent hiking, canoeing, biking, and many other things. And, the town of Cave City has lots to do as well. Stay in the park if you can, it is worth it. Check your busy life at the entrance and relax and enjoy.","October 24, 2010",Allow yourself plenty of time,202,"Bloomington, Minnesota",5
Mammoth Cave,"We camped 2 nights in mid-October 2010. The camp ground is very nice. The sites are a little close together but all facilities were very clean. I took my 3 kids on the Frozen Niagra tour because it was the shortest trip at 1 hour. My kids are 10, 5 and 4 so I thought that would be too long but was amazed at how fast the hour went by. If I had it to do over I would do a longer tour for sure. My kids throughly enjoyed it. I did as well but thought it was way too short.","October 22, 2010",Great Trip,2,"Nashville, Tennessee",4
Mammoth Cave,"This was my second trip to Mammoth Cave. The first was 35 years ago. Much has changed, of course. We stayed in a rustic two bedroom cabin near the visitor center. It was an economical choice and contained the basic necessities. There are many types of tours having various levels of difficulty. My daughter and granddaughter went on Intro to Caving, having to suit up with helmet and all. They needed to be in very good physical condition to crawl through narrow places. I went on the Violet Lantern Tour with the other two grandchildren. It was very interesting historically speaking, to see the cave the way the early tourists did with only handheld lanterns to light the way. There were stops to see the tuberculosis treatment facility, saltpeter works, and early cave dweller artifacts. Don't do this tour to see much of the natural surroundings, however. Because of the low light, it was necessary for me to always concentrate on where I was walking. The ranger programs at night are extremely educational and worth the time. Food at the park restaurants was not memorable.","October 14, 2010",Educational for nature lovers,4,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",5

Mammoth Cave,I went to Mammoth caves and went on their Wild Cave tour. It was spectacular! This was a whole new experience from walking through caves and seeing features that were lit up and walking paved paths. We crawled climbed and wriggled our way through passages not taken by the thousands of visitors taking the regular tours. We still saw some of the more amazing features but spent most of our time in tunnels and canyons within the cave. This was an absolutely amazing experience and I will be bringing friends back the next time!,"October 10, 2010",Amazing Tours,55,"Holland, Michigan",5
Mammoth Cave,"This to me is just the definition of a National Park. There is so much to see it almost ridiculous. If you are making the trip there absolutely do a guided tour. They make it such a great experience!We took the ""New Entrance Tour"" and it was great! You enter the cave via a steep twisting staircase that was built to conform to the walls and caverns as to not disturb the natural formations. Just that was worth the trip but then you continue on and literally stand in rock rooms the size of a football field 250 feet below the ground.MUST SEE!","September 18, 2010",Amazing Amazing Amazing,4,"Minooka, Illinois",5
Mammoth Cave,"I took my 6 year old son on a day trip this past Sunday. We drove 1.5 hours from Franklin TN. We had an awesome time...super classy tour guides and visitor center. 2 quick cave tour reviews:*Frozen Niagra Tour: We arrived at 8:00 am and took the first available tour, the Frozen Niagra tour. (named this because the rock formations look like ice) It's a short bus ride within the park to a man-made cave entrance, then a short 1/4 mile hike in the cave to see some fabulous rock formations. This is a great warm up tour worth checking out.**Historic Tour: This is a 2 hour, 2 mile hike into the main cave. You walk to the ""natural entrance"" to the cave which is a huge natural entrance you'll love. It's awesome. It's so big in there! And the tour guides tell great stories that keep your attention. We never got bored and we loved ""fat man's misery"" and ""tall man's agony"". We were also good and tired after this second trip and enjoyed a great lunch in the on-site restaurant. Misc: There were seniors on our historic tour. Much of the walk is actually paved or very smooth rock/dirt. But...it is a solid two mile hike and not all of the walk way is smooth. There's also a total of 500 stairs involved (up and down). So you need to make sure any seniors or kids in your group (no strollers) can walk two miles plus a bunch of stairs over about 2 hours. The more realistic challenge for seniors is the dim lighting in the cave. There are lots of places to bump your head or trip if you have bad vision. And there are no quick ways out if you get in and have a hard time. You either go back out the way you came or continue on. Don't miss Mammoth Cave. It's a great place and the cave tours are lots of fun for kids and grown ups.","September 13, 2010",Wonderful Place! Don't Miss It,65,Franklin TN,5

Mammoth Cave,"I've toured Mammoth Cave several times. It's amazing and well-worth the visit. I'm reviewing my latest attempt at touring the caverns because some people may run into the same problems. I have a four-year old, hyper boy who cannot tour anything for 1.5 hours, so we were excited to do the Discovery tour. I read online that it's self-guided and I've done this tour, before. It would've been perfect because we could leave if he got antsy. The information online states that the tour is dependent upon staff and volume of visitors. Well, I guess I should've called before arrival because they weren't offering the Discovery Tour at all. They said we could do the exact same tour, but it would be guided. NOT what we wanted since it'd be 1.25 hours! Several tours were sold out at certain times, as well. I asked two different workers why the Discovery Tour wasn't offered. One said it was too busy and another said there weren't enough visitors! It would be nice if they'd update their website to tell people for sure if a tour isn't offered or is sold out. I guess it was my fault for not calling, first.Bottom Line: This experience is a must, but you must call first to ensure you'll get the tour you want. Otherwise, you may be waiting for hours (as we saw many people doing) or leave very frustrated (as we did). Do your homework before visiting this attraction!","August 6, 2010","Love the Caverns, but the Tour We Wanted Wasn't Available",43,Virginia,4
Mammoth Cave,"Mammoth Cave is truly amazing. It is mostly a dry, limestone cave with few flows, stalagmites, etc. It is a must-do for cave fans. The Historical Tour is a real jaw-dropper. The Snowball Tour is fairly lame, and shows very little of how spectacular Mammoth Cave is. But if you really want to eat an overpriced boxed lunch 250 feet underground, by all means go for it. Otherwise, save your money and do a different tour.Hope this helps..","July 28, 2010",Lives Up to the Legend,287,"Indianapolis, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"The tour of the cave was amazing and really cool to do! Before I went on the cave tour I ate in that fast food restaurant of the Park, and was offended by the lack of service. The fast food restaurant only takes cash (not posted very well), I was shocked when the girl told me that (how many places don't take debit/credit cards nowadays?) I left to find the ATM and returned with cash,and the girl behind the counter rolled her eyes directly at me and sighed disgustingly. She then was extremely sarcastic while I ordered. Completely unnecessary! I would not suggest going to that restaurant, there are two other restaurants at the park - a diner and a fine dining establishment. I'm sure one of the other two has to be better! Enjoy the cave tour!!","July 23, 2010","The tour of the cave was awesome, the service in the restaurants was not.",0,"Annville, Pennsylvania",4

Be prepared for some narrow steps, and really fast tour guides. It felt like we were practially running through the cave.There was not enough time to really pause and enjoy the spectacular surroundings because they kept us moving the whole time. Because the tour group is so big, we didn't even really see the tour guides except when they paused a couple of times during the tour to bring the whole group back together.

Mammoth Cave,"Initially we were worried about taking our 4 and 1 year old on this tour. Unfortunately, since we visited on one of the busiest weekends in the year, the shorter Frozen Niagara Tour had sold out. The park ranger we spoke to also assured that kids do come on the New Entrance Tour. But thank God we did this than just the Frozen Niagara. We got to see a real cave than just the decorated part of it!You go down a narrow flight of about 300 steps. At some points it is very narrow that carrying a small baby can be difficult and you have to watch out not to hit yourself or the baby against the rock! Once you are at the bottom, no more tight spots. Some steep climbs and some slippery slopes. At nearly the end you see the big ""ta-da"".. the stalagmites and stalactites, which are actually part of the Frozen Niagara tour. There are lot of people on this tour. There's one ranger leading the way and the other tailing. My 4 year old did all the steps and the walking by herself. My 1 year old, about whom we were worried, did perfectly fine. The tour took exactly two hours from the point you board the bus and till you return. No bags. Only a clear bottle of water allowed. So we ensured our kids finished all their ""in"" and ""out"" before we boarded the bus! I just wished that we have seen more of the cave.. like the pits and domes. Also wish the ranger gave out more information and history. It was a large crowd and I felt they did a great job!","July 6, 2010",New Entrance Tour - a good introduction to the cave,29,"London, United Kingdom",4
Mammoth Cave,"Visited Mammoth Cave for a day trip with 2 other friends. Both of the tours are great especially for family members. As we are a bunch of energetic 20s, the tour felt like a walk in a shopping mall. The cave was so clean, and the natural air-conditioning was so comfortable. I think you can go on a self-guided tour for the part of the cave that is covered by Historic Tour. The New Entrance Tour was really cool, especially the part at the Frozen Niagra, we were so amazed by the work of the mother nature! Listed as one of the World Heritage Sites and being the longest cave system in the world, Mammoth Cave is definitely worth visiting. But if you are young and energetic, don't take these tours which are also for 3 month-old babies. I think Violet City Lantern Tour or Introduction to Caving Tour would be a more adventurous experience! Camping would be nice too if you have the time.","July 5, 2010",Great Experience with the Historic and New Entrance Tour,41,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",4
Mammoth Cave,"I only had 1 day to spend at the park and I drove from Louisville. I called the park to see what tours they would recommend for a one-day trip and he told me he wasn't allowed to give any recommendations. I decided to take the New Entrance and Historic Tours since they seemed to be the most popular with tourists. I reserved my tours online about one week prior to my trip. I took the earliest tours and it seemed to be less congested with people that were going in the afternoon.The New Entrance tour was .4 mile and take 2 hours. ( A lot of talking from the park ranger) You descend 250 steps in a narrow passageway. this entrance was blasted open in 1920's before it became a national park. If you get claustrophobic, this section of the tour would not be good for you. After the steps, it opened into a big room where we sat while the park ranger spoke to us. We were then on our way to the ""pretty"" part of Mammoth Cave. This portion of the tour is magnificent with rock formations. You won't find this in any other part of the cave. Other tours will include this on their tour, excluding the 250 steps and man-made entrance.Then, I took the Historic Tour. We went into the cave through the natural entrance. I would go on this tour again. The park ranger said this tour would be strenuous. It is 2 miles and 2 hours. If you are in any sort of physical condition, you will be okay. The only problem would be when you get into Mammoth Dome and you have to climb up a series of stairs. The park rangers are really good about making sure to go at a slow pace and there is enough people on the tour that you could stop and rest for a minute if needed. There was a lot of interesting things on this trip. The Mammoth Dome, Fat Man's Misery, (a narrow passageway) and ""bottomless pits"". Plus, the history behind the tour is cool. In both tours, the park rangers turned out the lights to give the effect of what it would be like when the first visitors visited the cave. If I were to do it over again, and only had 1 day, I would probably do the Grand Avenue tour. You see the ""pretty"" (frozen niagra) part of the cave and also portions of the historic tour. This is 4 hours and 4 miles long. The reason I didn't choose this one is because other reviewers said that it was too long and all the rocks started looking the same. But after I did these other tours, I only saw the 2 ends of the cave and nothing in the middle, which I believe the Grand Avenue tour would take you to. Overall, my experience at Mammoth Cave was awesome. The expanse of the cave is unreal and definitely something to see while vacationing in Kentucky. There is also no entrance fee to get into the park. You just pay for the tours. There are a couple of restaurants on site. The one I ate at was a fast food joint. The other one looked like a sit down restaurant. I saw a service store on-site too.","July 4, 2010",New Entrance and Historic Tour,22,"Saratoga Springs, Utah",4
Mammoth Cave,"We purchased tickets online for a longer tour, but my daughter wasn't feeling well and we needed a shorter, easier tour. We arrived early and were able to exchange tickets for the Frozen Niagra, which the ranger advised would be easier. We had a nice, short and easy tour of part of the cave. It is not appropriate for someone in a wheel chair or using a walker, but it had relatively few stairs and tight passages. The ranger on the bus to the entrance was very informative, as was the ranger who lead the cave tour. I would have liked to stay longer in the park and explored the trails.

The formations with in the cave was so neat that pictures don't do it justice. Keep in mind when going here that they have a different time zone. We ended up being really early so we went down to the camp store where they fixed us bologna sandwiches. It was as if mom was right there fixing them for us, they were really nice people.

For as many people as we had, the park had it well coordinated and planned. Our guide, Joanna, was very informative. There were about 280 steps on this tour, but I didn't find it overly strenuous, although after a while, the steps did get to you. It is astounding that they could build that many steps getting into the cave. The tour was very interesting. The drapery room was the most scenic part of the tour.Also they do not allow you to bring camera cases into the cave.","June 15, 2010",New Entrance Tour,778,"Marlton, New Jersey",4
Mammoth Cave,"We arrived at he Visitor's Center the night before we planned to tour. The staff was very friendly and immediately asked if my daughters (9 & 10) would like to be Junior Wildlife Rangers by completing activities in a workbook. The oldest did and the next day she received a certificate and badge, pretty cute. The staff was also helpful as we picked our tour. We were there the first week of June on a weekday, so we didn't bother buying tickets in advance. I probably would have if it had been later in the summer or on a weekend. We did the New Entrance tour wearing tennis shoes and hoodies. We put sweatpants on the girls, but husband and I were fine in shorts and capris. This tour has LOTS of steps, 280 on the initial descent. Our girls did fine and we had a great tour. It was very informative and a pretty good hike, but not overly strenuous. There were about 40 in our group and we stopped for breaks about 4 times so everyone could catch up and the guides would give information. Our primary guide was Kevin Carney, probably the best tour guide we've ever had anywhere. He was friendly, knowledgeable and had a great dry sense of humor. Couldn't have been nicer. His cohort bringing up the rear was Gabe Esters. Since he wasn't leading the tour he was quieter, but I think he would also give a good tour. The tour is listed for 2 hours but our small group was finished earlier than that.

Mammoth Cave,"Beautiful attraction, something you definitely need to make a point of seeing. I will only repeat what others have said. Make sure you choose the correct tour. Some of them are very strenuous. We did new entrance which had alot of stairs! I was so sore the next few days--and I work out constantly. But the new entrance tour was beautiful. I'd do it again because you get to see so many nice formations once the tour gets rolling. Our ranger/tour guide was just hilarious and fun to listen to and very informative. He made the tour that much more awesome. So, wear good walking shoes and be prepared for steps. We also ate in the little cafe at the park while we waited. It was very good food, for a very good price! You don't expect that at a tourist attraction. But my husband and I each ordered huge club sandwiches, which came with chips or fries. Our ticket was maybe 10 bucks at the most. I'm going to digress a little if I may........Please be courteous and don't bring babies. Some lady brought a baby on our tour and it cried the entire time. It's a cave. It's dark. The tour we did had like 400 steps..... Don't bring babies. You may bring children on most of the tours.

Mammoth Cave,"Other reviewers have covered the cave itself pretty well, so I just want to offer some logistical suggestions. We visited on the Tuesday right after Memorial Day and found no crowds at all. We took the New Entrance Tour, which has a ticket limit of 114 -- we had just 7 people in our group and it was fantastic! The ranger guiding the tour was able to get into a lot more explanation and interaction with such a small group. I strongly recommend you visit on an ""off day,"" because this must be hard with a large group -- you have to walk single file, and there are only a few places on this tour where you can gather a group for a talk about what you're seeing. New Entrance is a good tour if you are concerned about strenuousness. You walk down 280 steps, straight down a shaft, at the very start. But you only have to come up 220 (to a different exit), and these steps are spaced out along the route, not all at once. $12 per person and well worth it.","June 3, 2010",New Entrance Tour was fascinating without being over strenuous,227,"Putnam, Connecticut",5

Mammoth Cave,"I took two tours and have mixed reviews about both..The first was the Snowball Tour which consisted of 3 hours with a half hour lunch in the snowball room.. It was mostly a hike of nothing to see but a destroyed cave and a history lecture about Mammoth Cave.. I like lectures but it needs to contain something to see along with it.. It's a lame tour with no formations other than broken gypsym flower and snowballs in a modified dining room. They were on a schedule and tried to hurry it along which in turned amounted to a hike and a lunch in a cave.. The lunch u bought..The second tour was the New Entrance and it was awesome, The trip down was cool with a twisting staircase descending fast, it was pouring outside making a waterfall that escorted us down to the bottom, soaking us and making it very exciting to see. The Frozen Niagaria is amazing with huge drapery and cave bacon formations that made the trip worth it besides a horrible beginning.I advise take the smaller tours, the historic and new entrance, if you like to hike and see a whole lot of hollow cave then the snowball and grand avenue tour is for you..

Mammoth Cave,"I tried to see Mammoth Cave three times and failed on the first two attempts. The cave is locked and therefore only accessible if you are a member of a National Park ranger led tour. The third time I successfully did the ""Grand Avenue"" and ""Historic"" tours of the cave.I booked ahead on the website, which had very good descriptions of the tours. i had never been in a cave before, so i was a tad leary of going inside for the first time for four hours (the time for the Grand Avenue tour). What a fabulous experience. Any person with any adventure would like to cave. Yes, there were tons of stairs, inclines, declines to make it strenouous. However, any able bodied soul in good shape can do this. The Historic tour was also very good. However, the 'first is always best"" syndrome is clouding my experience. It, too was faboulous. Rated at moderate, I'd say it is every bit as easy/hard as grand avenue. Both keep you on your feet; no crawling though places on your belly. Just do it & enjoy.","April 29, 2010",Worth doing,104,"Cleveland, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"Me and my 9,7 and 17 year old went to Mammoth Cave in April 2010. It was worth driving 8 hours to see. We would recommend purchasing your tickets ahead of time since we didn't get to do the tour we wanted to go on which was the new entrance tour. We ended up going on the historic tour and it was great. The kids liked the bottomless pit and fat man's misery. This tour was two hours long. The kids attention was focused the whole time. We've visited other caves but this one was the best so far. I can't wait to go back to take a different tour. It is a dry cave and one part was bigger than some auditoriums I've been in, absolutely fun and interesting.","April 17, 2010",Mammoth Cave Historic Tour was great!,75,"Westville, Indiana",5
Mammoth Cave,"Our family took the Grand Avenue Tour. While cognizant of the strenuous rating of the tour we were unprepared for the pace at which our guides kept. We are experienced hikers which keep a leisurely, but consistent pace to enjoy the most while trying not to miss most. With this preface, we were unprepared for the consistent power walker speed at which the tour was conducted. The entire tour felt rushed and I am sure we missed many formations.While we did get a sense for the sheer magnitude of the cave system. There was little differentiation in the sights to be seen. A few crystals, passageways carved by underground rivers, and huge rooms. This is 90% of the tour.The last 10% is the Frozen Niagara which was the highlight for us.If you do go:Comfortable shoes/sneakers or hiking boots with good grip are a necessity.Layer your clothing. When resting you will be chilled, after the large hill climbs you will want to peel off a layer.There are absolutely no bags allowed, not even fanny packs.","April 11, 2010",Grand Avenue Tour,3,"Charlotte, NC",3

Mammoth Cave,"We went to Mammoth Cave over the summer. Our group spent two days there, and even after that felt like we had not seen the whole cave. We took the 2 hour Historic tour and the 4.5 hour Grand Avenue tour. Both tours are guided by Park Rangers. The pace of the walk is pretty leisurely; we didn't have anyone falling behind. You are walked through various tunnels and passages of the cave.  The tour stops at the main attractions so the Rangers can tell you stories about the history of the cave while you enjoy the view. There is also a lights out moment where they ask everyone to shut off their phones and lights so you can see the true darkness the early cave explorers had to deal with.The Grand Avenue tour stops for lunch. The meal is pretty good, with soup or sandwich, and is pretty inexpensive. The restrooms are interesting, with the ceiling still being a part of the cave! There are also some creatures you may see, such as cave spiders and bats. Not many, but they are there. The only drawback is trying to take pictures. Tripods are not allowed, and you are not allowed to touch anything in the cave, so you can't rest your camera on something to try and take a picture. Since the cave is so dark and huge, flashes obviously won't work.","December 19, 2009",Mammoth Cave - One Day is just Not enough!!,37,"Littleton, Colorado",4
Mammoth Cave,"So you've been to Carlsbad and really enjoyed the awesome formations and the light show. Mammoth is nothing like Carlsbad. And that's OK. Mammoth is a real caving experience. We did the New Entrance tour. You'll crouch, slip, bend and trip your way through this one. No, you won't see a lot of eye candy. But you'll get a good idea of what a real cave explorer does for a living. I was annoyed by all the restrictions on what you can and cannot take with you. We were traveling with our 2 year old and our baby backpack would have come in handy.

Mammoth Cave,"We took the Frozen Niagara tour, which is described as including the most, and best, cave formations, and it is described as taking 1 hour and 15 minutes. However, more than half of that time is spent taking the bus ride to the cave opening and listening to the polite tour guide give warnings and instructions. The actual time in the cave included a very rapid 1/8 mile walk into the cave (very short indeed) that takes you past some nice, although limited, cave formations, and then a few steps down to view the Frozen Niagara flowstone formation from below. From there it is a very rapid exit on the same path you took to enter. When it was over several people asked the guide if that was all there was, and we felt the same.We have toured a variety of caves, including Carlsbad (fantastic!), several local caves (very good), and other small caves across the country. Compared to what we've seen before, the Frozen Niagara tour was much less than expected, especially for the price.","October 21, 2009",Not as grand as you are hoping,42,"La Grange, Texas",3
Mammoth Cave,"We took our two kids, ages 10 and 12 and went on the Grand Avenue Tour, which we booked a few months in advance. It was not strenuous if you are used to walking, a bit slippery in places and very narrow in others. We brought a bag lunch and water bottle along to save some cash. They had plenty of stops along the way for people to rest and for the rest of the group to catch up. It was very facinating for the kids - never boring because there were so many different passageways and lighting situations. Having a flashlight was fun for our younger child to peer into crevices and look for the infamous ""cave spiders"" - which were really very large crickets, we were told. After we left the cave, we hiked around the park down to the Green River (keep your hiking boots on for this). Don't get too close - the banks are slippery in the spring! Horse Cave Hampton Inn was a nice place to stay in the area, and offered free breakfast and pool.","October 17, 2009","Awesome, Active Family Trip",10,"Libertyville, Illinois",5

The park area is amazing (I have been in the evening several times when deer are everywhere!)The caves are unreal. So much of the cave is unexplored too, which adds a lot of mystery to it.If you are planning a trip to the cave and the area, do some research. The tale of Floyd Collins is fascinating (read the book, ""Trapped! The Story of Floyd Collins"" by Marry and Brucker). Sites associated with Collins are around the main cave area.Also, take the time to visit Big Mike's Rock and Gift shop.

Mammoth Cave,"We took the New Entrance Tour on July 2009. The tour was fun and well worth it. Our kids, 7 and 9 year-old boys, both enjoyed it. It is as good as the more-heavily-advertised Ruby Falls Cave in Chattannogah TN. The two-hour tour including the bus ride was not too long, just fine. It is strongly advisable to buy tickets on-line (need to buy at least one day prior to tour) since the tickets sell out really fast on summer. I checked the night prior to the tour and there were still 60 or more tickets available (there are about 120 tickets available per tour for that hour) and yet on the day we have to wait 3 hours because the tickets were sold out for the earlier tours. I didn't realize that this place is really popular even on weekdays.There are plenty of trails on the site. But the heat and humidity makes it not comfortable to hike on summer. I am sure during fall, it will be spectacular because of all the trees.We stayed at a hotel in Elizabethtown KY (one hour north of Mammoth Cave). They have more hotel and restaurant choices in that area. Besides we had planned to go to Abe Lincoln's birthplace which is 15 minutes south of Elizabethtown KY. The is very educational and entertaining for the kids and adult, too. Don't forget to ask for Junior Ranger booklet for the kids (also available at Mammoth Cave but different edition). They get a Park Ranger badge if they answer the booklet which makes the trip even more educational and memorable.","August 1, 2009",Mammoth Cave and sourrounding region,2,Kentucky,5

The only tours left were the Historic and New Entrance. We took the Historic Tour. It was a nice tour, but no real formations as this part of the cave is dry. The guide did say that you can find formations when you take other tours. We were only passing through, so we didn't have time to schedule a different tour the next day. We plan to go back, so that we can spend more time exploring the different tours/areas of the cave.","July 23, 2009",Wonderful Experience,9,oklahoma,4

Mammoth Cave,"My third visit to Mammoth cave in twenty years and there are still tours I'd love to take there. Not many formations in this cave but it has a very interesting history and the guides are incredibly knowledgable. We did the New Entrance Tour, which covered a wide span of the other various tours, including the one area (Frozen Niagra) with formations. There were plenty of spots to rest and regroup along the way so the walk and stairs wasn't too tiring even for our six year old. We also did the Star Chamber tour, which was a great experience. This lantern tour is very limited and only once a day - the last tour - so get your tickets early. Lots of interesting history and parts of the cave that I've not seen on any other tour. The lantern light added a different aspect to the tour, letting you experience the cave like the first tours did along with a period of total cave darkness in the star chamber. Watch out on the ride through the park to the visitor center as there is a lot of wildlife along the road. We saw many deer and turkeys.","July 18, 2009",A tour for everyone,56,Michigan,5
Mammoth Cave,"our summer trip was centered around Mammoth Cave. Being from Missouri, we have toured many fabulous caves in our state that are full of beautiful cave formations. What a disappointment when we went on our really long, really boring tour, to discover that the vast majority of the cave looks like a mine. Very few formations, lots of rock. We ended up cancelling the reservations we had for the second day's tour and went instead to Diamond Caverns which was beautiful! We were also disappointed by the total lack of educational information in the visitor center. they were doing construction on a new addition, so maybe that's where most of that was displayed, but they chose to leave in the gift shop area, even though they have 2 more in the hotel area you can walk thru.","July 15, 2009",What a disappointment!!!,5,"Springfield, MO",1

This tour gives you views of Grand Central Station and several of the bigger areas. Tour lasted about 2 hours counting the bus ride (5 min.) and the cave is around 50 degrees. We brought jackets but because we walked so much, we didn't even wear them. Slippery terrain and uneven ground requires tennis shoes...with tread. If you plan on making a day out of it, I would suggest packing a picnic for the picnic area across from the visitor center.

Mammoth Cave,"Decided to do the 4 1/2 hour ""strenuous"" Grand Avenue tour of Mammoth Cave. 4 mile cave hike with 7, 8 and 13 year old kids, plus myself (completely out of shape 37) and very fit 41 year old dad.First, the ranger, Kenisha, was very knowledgeable and a joy to have as our guide. The trip itself was pretty tame, with four large ""mountains"" you take switchbacks up. Anyone who can climb a flight of stairs without running out of breath should be fine (although my calves were a little sore the next day, but I'm out of shape :-)During our hike, the cave lost power in certain sections due to a thunderstorm on the surface. Our ranger guides broke out Coleman kerosene lanterns and asked for those with flashlights to help out. (In addition, we all turned on our cell phones and viewfinders on our camers--amazing at the amount of light those give off) It made for an interesting 3/8ths of a mile and added to the trip experience!We ate lunch in the Snowball dining rooms ( a boxed lunch for $7.50 included a sandwich, cookie, chips, apple, drink and cup of soup--trust me, you'll want the warm soup!) and with the lighting delay, spent about 5 hours in the cave. The children got a bit bored by the seemingly unchanging rocks but overall enjoyed it. I would recommend a shorter tour simply because after awhile it all looked the same...and I have an Earth science degree.","June 13, 2009",Lots and lots of limestone down there...,302,"Phoenix, Arizona",4
Mammoth Cave,"At 350+ miles, Mammoth Cave is the longest explored cave in the world. We learned that if you add the second and third longest caves together, it still wouldn't come close to Mammoth's length. While the cave was carved out by an underground river, it is a surprisingly ""dry"" cave. Stalactites and stalagmites can only be viewed in a small portion of the cave.  This was our second time to Mammoth and the biggest change was that you cannot take backpacks, fanny packs or camera cases into the cave. So if you want to take water, flashlight, etc, wear a jacket or pants that have big pockets. Order tickets ahead of time to make sure you get the tours you want. The Historic Tour takes you through the natural entrance of the cave as you explore levels two through four of the underground maze, sometimes 300+ feet below the surface. Highlights include Fat Man's and Tall Man's Misery, the abandoned salt petre mining operation and Giant's Coffin. Those afraid of heights might be a little nervous crossing The Bottomless Pit and climbing the stairs at Mammoth Dome. It's a great tour to start you out, though we were hoping to see the TB hospital. At the end of the tour we were able to walk around the Discovery Tour area before leaving the cave. The Grand Avenue Tour is a good tour if you just can't get enough of caves. This is a four hour tour, walking about four miles. Like our tour guide said, if you have problems walking four miles above ground, you will have problems walking four miles underground. And when you're on your third hour, and navigating around yet another rock pile, it starts to feel like a long tour and you know that the only way to get out is to keep going. In hindsight, I would have chosen to go on two shorter tours than this one. There are two bathrooms breaks (wohoo!) and lunch at the Snowball Room, which is named for the gypsum formations on the ceiling. As stated in other reviews, the lunch is nothing special, but the atmosphere is great! The end of the tour takes you through the beautiful Frozen Niagara area. The New Entrance Tour is a very interesting tour where you begin by descending quite a few steps. Our tour guide said we were around 300+ feet below the surface when we got to the bottom. We were impressed with those who had to put the steps in, since a couple of places had tight corners. From there you link into the end of the Grand Avenue and Frozen Niagara tour routes. The Frozen Niagara and Drapery Room contains beautiful flowstone, stalactites and stalagmites....what you would expect from a ""wet"" cave. We were told not to take any photos on the way down to the Drapery Room as to not stop the tour. The only problem with trying to take a photo on the way up is that unless you're one of the last few people or have a kind soul who stops, it's very hard to get a photo of the most spectacular formations without people in it. Most people come to see the cave, but there's also hiking above ground if you so choose. There is a short boardwalk around Sloan Pond where you can learn about surface water in the park, hear frogs and see turtles. You can hike (also by boardwalk) to Sand Cave where Floyd Collins was trapped and died in the 1920's. If you need a little longer hike, we would recommend the Cedar Sink Trail. It's a little more rugged but not too long and it takes you to a nice overlook of the Cedar Sink.","June 10, 2009",The Best Cave East of the Mississippi,222,Ohio,5

Mammoth Cave,"We have visited Mammoth Cave several times over the years, and the kids are finally old enough for one of the longer tours. The Grand Avenue Tour is a 4 1/2 hr tour that winds through a large section of the cave. It is rated as difficult, and if you have trouble walking up and down steep slopes, this may not be for you. The kids (8 and 13) had no trouble with the walking. There are frequent stops for narrative from the guide, so a reasonably fit person will have no trouble with the tour. The steps were easy compared to the occasionally steep and slippery slopes. 90% of the tour is through tubes formed by the river long ago. You will see large rooms, narrow canyons, wide tubes, and a few tight squeezes between rocks. It can get a bit monotonous since all the rocks look about the same. It is a dry cave, so other than the Frozen Niagra at the very end of the tour, you will not see the stalagtites and other formations that are plentiful in a wet cave (like Diamond Caverns). The guide was informative with a lot of talk about the geology and history of the cave. You eat lunch around 1 hour into the tour. The box lunch of a ham or turkey sandwhich, chips, apple, cup of vegetable soup, and drink is $7.50. They also have PB&J. The food was unremarkable, but hey, you're eating in a cave. Tour size was around 70 people, so don't expect any enroute commentary unless you are right behind the guide. This is a good tour for people who have an interest in cave geology and would like a nice walk, but you can see many of the more interesting features of the cave on shorter, less expensive tours.","April 17, 2009",Grand Avenue Tour - Lots of Rocks,152,"West Chester, OH",4
Mammoth Cave,"I've been on a LOT of cave tours. Here's why I rated this one as excellent... it is the perfect length and difficulty level for small children (and older people that can't get around so well). Adult tickets are $10. Kids under 6 are free.You board a bus at the MC Welcome Center (bonus - my kid loves ""school busses"" and was excited about riding one), and you ride the bus for about 5-10 minutes to the man-made entrance. There are only a couple of steps until you get to the Niagara formation, and the steps to the bottom of that are optional. We did them, and it wasn't bad at all for my 2-1/2 year old. You go out the same way you come in, and round trip it is only 1/4 mile.You can buy tickets a day or more in advance online or by phone. The day of you can buy them only at the Welcome Center. This tour always sells out, even on slow days so I recommend you purchasing in advance if your travel plans aren't flexible.

Mammoth Cave,"Our family (me plus wife and 12, 10 & 9 yo daughters) took Friday tours of New Entrance and Historic routes... the New Entrance Tour we did in the AM and Joe D, our ranger, was great! We had never gone to a cave before, so the girls had some concerns. Those QUICKLY went away due to Joe's personality and the underground beauty of the cave. NE tour starts with a LOT of steps to get you down to the base of the cave, and then you wind thru to see various formations, etc. Joe explained history and geology so we could all understand how this cave came to be. 2 hours in this tour, then we took a lunch break and went on the Historic Tour in the PM. Kevin N, led this one and was also great. LOTS of history has happened at Mammoth Cave, and we were fortuntate to have a small group so Kevin had a little more time to speak about what had happened over the past 200 yrs in the cave... rock formations, historical figures, medical experiments, war of 1812... COOL!!Speaking of COOL... caves are about 54 degrees F, but the NE tour was a shade warmer than HT... you can FEEL the cold air coming out of the HT cave mouth (outdoor temp was about 60 that day) and you get more of a chill in HT... I think the steps in the New Entrance tour get your blood warmed up & pumping, and the Historic route has more wide open space so warm air and body heat goes 30-50 feet above you... cold air settles to the floor of the cave.Can't say enough... THEN we stopped at the hotel's coffee shop and had snacks and ice cream. fantastic! And you get fair value for the $$ you spend... the motel on the ground is $55 total/night... we stayed 25 min away in Glasgow for the same $$ so our girls could swim in a pool, but staying at the park would have advantages too.

Mammoth Cave,"We took two tours on a Saturday in July. I booked them on-line two weeks in advance. We took the New Entrance tour in the morning and the Star Chamber tour in the evening. I am so glad I booked them in advance - the visitor center was a mad house. At 10 am most tours were sold out for the day. I had to stand in the same line as first time ticket purchasers to pick up my reserved tickets which was a little crazy.We have two adults, an 11 year old boy and a 7 year old girl in our family. The New Entrance tour was neat but if you are claustrophobic think twice about this tour. It was very close as we descended the vertical shafts. Most of the passages were narrow. It was an interesting tour. We saw a lot of formations at the end of the tour.That evening we came back for the Star Chamber tour by lantern light. We went down through the Historic Entrance. Wow! What a difference from the New Entrance. We really liked the contrast of the two tours. The Star Chamber tour had more walking than the New Entrance tour but neither were very strenuous. The passage ways in the star chamber tour were huge. The candle writing was awesome. Seeing the cave by lantern light was a great experience. We would definitely recommend taking two very different tours so that you get more of a feel for the vastness and diversity of the cave.","July 28, 2008",Great Family Trip,66,"Jefferson, Maryland",4
Mammoth Cave,"We just returned from a week in Kentucky and Mammoth Cave was certainly one of the highlights. We found the staff to be very helpful and the cave to absolutely amazing. We did two tours. One we booked several weeks in advance to insure we were on the trips that we wanted. Our daughters (9 and 11) went on the Trog Tour. They completely loved it. The rangers were great with the kids and the kids enjoyed being able to see things that weren't on any other tour. Here's a tip... don't be late for any of your booked tours. Literally, we were three minutes late for the Frozen Niagra tour and we missed the bus. We were not able to drive to entrance. The staff was very apologetic but there were no other tours available, the were very gracious to return our money (less a cancellation fee). We also went on the Self Guided Discovery tour. We really enjoyed having the time to ourselves and there were several rangers along the way to ask all of our questions. Mammoth Cave is not flashy, it's not filled with fancy lighting and weird cave organ music, but it is a true national treasure.","July 14, 2008",A Great National Park,131,"Orlando, Florida",4
Mammoth Cave,"After waiting an hour, our 11:30 am tour which we'd booked online was changed to 11:45 am. There was no assigned tour guide for our trip; the fill-in person never introduced themselves, announced themselves or described the tour. Whomever made the schedule, did not have a person assigned to our tour.With four tours leaving from the platform we were asked to shuffle back and forth from A and B platforms to allow the other tours to reach the buses. My wife asked three tour guides when ours was leaving; at 10:50 we learned our bus had simultaneously left with another tour.The response by staff was terrible. We got our money back and left in disgust. The platform should be organized by tour name and time; it's anyone's guess who ""planned"" the timetable with overlapping tours.If they couldn't remember to take us...would they also have left us behind in the cave?? That is my concern. Perhaps it is good we didn't give them the opportunity to leave us behind a second time.","July 11, 2008",Poor customer service. Never got to see the caves!,6,"Nashville, TN",1
Mammoth Cave,"My husband and 2 children, 9 & 12 just got home from Mammoth Caves. The tours are awesome and the guides make you feel very safe, while in the caves. There were a few things that we were unaware of before going on our tour that I thought might be helpful for you. When we reached the visitors center there was a station with park rangers who can help you pick a tour suitable for you and your family. However, when we went to buy our tickets for the time slot we wanted, everything was pretty much sold out. I STRONGLY recommend reservations by purchasing on-line before you get to the caves.( We got to the visitors center at 9:30 am. and there were only a few tours left to pick from and this was on a Tuesday which I assumed would not be a busy day.) We settled for a later time. I had wanted to spend the morning in the caves and the rest of the day sight seeing. We went on an afternoon tour and another tour which happened to be the last tour of the day. This really broke up our day. Also, some of the tours a redundant. Meaning the larger, longer tours cover some of the smaller tours and what you get to see. Be careful about which ones you pick.","July 10, 2008",The cave lovers paradise,4,Ohio,4
Mammoth Cave,"We booked in advance which was smart as when we got there it was sold out. Our tour started with the guide's speech before we boarded on the buses taking us to the new entrance. Our guide was great, he provided a lot of useful historic information while keeping it light and funny. The tour is roughly 2 hours including the bus tour. Its an amazing cave. We went 250 feet deep into the ground through narrow passages and stairs. Its dimly lit so bring a flash light if you don't like dark passages. Lot of kids and elderly people did the tour with us and it was not as strenous as it is made out to be. I would recomend wearing a light jacket as it gets in the mid 50's inside the cave irrespective of the weather outside. Overall, a great activity to do with friends and family.","July 5, 2008",New Entrance Tour,9,"Jackson, Tennessee",4
Mammoth Cave,"We are in Mammoth cave now. So far it has been great. Big word of advice, book your tours ahead of time. We did and I am glad we did, most of the tours were all sold out and it is a friday.We went on the Grand Avenue tour at 10am and we loved it. It is not for those who are not used to walking. The first half of the tour took us through fairly level large path ways. Then we had lunch in the snowball room. Word of advice, if you want to bring your own food you can. Just make sure you have it all in a large sandwich clear bag. Your water also has to be in a clear water bottle. It wouldn't be to bad to carry your food to lunch, but you would have to carry it. We just ate the food in the snowball room. It was ok, not great but what can you expect 200 feet or so down in a cave.The second half is much more of a work out. Don' t let the easy first half fool you. There is quiet a few stairs and many paths going up and down. I got winded a few times but held up ok. The ranger stops at the top of one of the larger hills to take a break.I really liked this tour because it showed many different types of paths , some skinny and wide, some tall and canyon like. The weather inside stays the same. It is raining today and other than getting into and out of the cave the outside weather doesn't affect you inside the cave.Last word of advice, this cave is known for being the longest in the world. It doesn't have all the pretty crystals and such in the cave. All it is are rocks and the way the underground river cut through the rocks. At the very end of this tour there is a small area of the pretty pretty formations. I loved the tour and highly recomend it.Yesterday, we went to see the Diamond tour (not part of Mammoth Cave National Park). This is definatly where you want to go if you want to see pretty pretty formations. This tour is about an hour long and worth the extra bucks to go. No need for advanced tickets, but you can save a buck if you pay for your tickets online.","March 28, 2008",A great place to go,16,"Columbus, OH",5
Mammoth Cave,"MCNP is a cave lover’s paradise. The park itself consists of trails, picnic facilities, cabins, campsites, inn, restaurant etc. You can purchase tickets for cave tours at the visitors center (plenty of parking), you’ll be transported on a bus to the cave. There are numerous tours you can go on within the park, there are also a number of privately owned cave attractions scattered on the perimeter of the park. While you are in the area, you could check out the Corvette museum and assembly plant in nearby Bowling Green. In terms of admission for the tours (government and private), you’re looking at anywhere from 7-16 dollars. Don’t forget your comfortable shoes.","December 3, 2007",Plenty to see and do...,485,"Knoxville, Tennessee",4
Mammoth Cave,"My husband and I spent a weekend in Mammoth Cave and Cave City, and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience and will go back.We booked the 4 mile, 4 1/2 hour Grand Avenue tour. With this tour, we saw many different ""personalities"" of Mammoth Cave, from the long subway-tunnellike ""Cleaveland Avenue"" to the funky Snowball room to Mt. McKinley to the beautiful Frozen Niagara formation. The group stopped for lunch in the Snowball room where they were selling boxed lunches, soup, and candy. We were amazed at the modern restrooms installed in the middle of this cave! My husband and loved this tour because the scenery and rooms of the cave kept changing. I would love to go back today and gladly do that whole tour over again! The Grand Ave tour is rated as strenuous, but I didn't really think it was that bad since I am an avid hiker. For those who don't exercise much, though, I might think it would be a tough trip since it is 4 miles long, and there are many steep hills and stairs involved. The rangers strongly warned everyone prior to getting into the buses that the tour was difficult and that they had one final opportunity to back out. I saw several fit-looking seniors on our tour who looked a little winded at times but were otherwise fine. However, there was one extremely obese woman who should have known better after the warnings than to try this tour... and she did have trouble and lagged behind, and predictably slowed down the rest of our group of about 70 people. I would recommend heeding whatever warnings the rangers give you and don't risk taking a tour you're not sure you can handle.As others have mentioned, be sure to book your tour online before arriving at Mammoth Cave because you stand a good chance of arriving to sold-out tours. The Mammoth Cave visitors' center and other facilities did have a very retro, state-park feel to them as opposed to the majestic lodges of other national parks. There is definitely no glitz and glamour here! I didn't mind it, though... it was a relaxing place, and pretty fun!We attended a nighttime ranger presentation on cougars at the amphitheater, and it was very well done. We were treated to a slide show of national park scenes set to music before the presentation started. It was so nice to sit in the dark in the outdoors and relax to this beautiful show on the large modern screen. The information presented on cougars was actually quite fascinating!Be careful... in August, snakes are everywhere! Ask the rangers where snake activity is highest... they will tell you which areas to avoid. I literally almost stepped on a copperhead on my way to the amphitheater!The drawbacks that I found to Mammoth Cave are the lack of convenient hiking trails, and unappealing campgrounds. Most of the longer hikes (more than 1 or 2 miles) are on the other side of the park that requires quite a bit of driving (30+ miles) to access. There are a few shorter trails near the visitors' center, but not many. We did most of them in a couple of hours. We also checked out the campground near the main entrance as well as another near the river, and the sites seemed cramped and exposed. However, if all you care about is simply seeing the cave, then you'll be fine. We stayed in Cave City at the brand new Comfort Inn and Suites... see my review there. We highly recommend that hotel also!","October 4, 2007",Definitely worth checking out,288,"Columbia, South Carolina",4
Mammoth Cave,"This place is incredible. You have to see it to appreciate it...its difficult to describe in words the wonder and size of the caves when you're in there. Even if you're passing through the area, and you have some extra time, I highly recommend taking a Mammoth Cave tour. There are several to choose from, and its a very good value to see one of nature's great splendors. We took the New Entrance Tour and were awed by it...it was especially interesting when they turned out the lights...talk about dark! The formations, size, and seemingly endless pathways down there are amazing. The tour was 2 hours, and my 6 and 8 year old boys really had an adventure...though it was hard to keep them from doing some unauthorized rock climbing!If you're around my age (i.e., were a kid in the 70's), this place will remind you of road trips with your parents in station wagons and no name motels. Mammoth Cave has a hotel, gift shop, and a couple restaurants, but it is still not highly commercialized or over-developed. It is a little bit of a throwback to a generation ago, and probably hasn't changed much in appearance since 1971, which is around the last time I visited at the age of 3.So if you're looking for very modern, high tech entertainment, this place would not be on your list. There's no laser show or 3D movie or 5 star restauarant....but if you want to see an incredible formation of nature and say you've been to the longest cave system in the world...don't miss Mammoth Cave.","September 29, 2007",Incredible place,54,"Granger, IN",5
Mammoth Cave,"We visited the park in August and thoroughly enjoyed our experience here. We participated in two tours: the Historic & New Entrance Tours. The New Entrance Tour was formerly known as the Frozen Niagara Tour.First of all, the park rangers should be commended for sharing their knowledge and expertise with park guests. We found everyone helpful here, and the rangers were friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the cave's history. The rangers ensure that each guest has a great experience.For those who may not be aware, this cave has the longest miles of discovered passages in the world (over 300 discovered miles and still counting). Its name certainly fits! The size of many of the rooms/passages will amaze you.This cave is NOT known for its formations. If you are coming expecting a show cave, you will be disappointed. If you truly enjoy the diversity of caves, you will love this park!! Those interested in seeing the small amount of formations in the cave should be sure to do the New Entrance, Frozen Niagara or Focus on Formations Tours. The New Entrance is the most challenging of the 3 and covers the most territory (3/4 mile). The Frozen Niagara/Drapery Room at the end of the tour was a highlight!The Historic tour (2 miles long) does not include the formations but is well worth doing, as guests learn the history of the cave and get to experience Fat Man's/Tall Man's Miseries & Mammoth Dome. One tip...if you are claustrophobic or have a severe fear of heights, heed the ranger's warning and do not take this tour!! The rangers will describe exactly what is expected of each person before starting the tour, and their descriptions are extremely accurate. We were fine with everything, but I know people with severe claustrophobia would not fare well.It's a good idea to book your tour(s) on-line during peak season (recreation.gov). All tours are described in great detail here. It was very warm when we were there, and on our 2nd day, all tours were sold out. It was a cool activity on a hot day, and many people were disappointed.The tours are a bit strenuous (the ones we did were considered moderate), but the rewards are well worth the efforts. Be sure to wear supportive shoes (flip flops are NOT a good idea, as the cave trails can be uneven and slippery). Overall, be prepared to have an awesome experience!","September 7, 2007",Awesome Experience!,86,"Pitman, New Jersey",5
Mammoth Cave,"It has been a long hot summer in Kentucky. For a day trip within Kentucky, we decided to go to Mammoth Cave National Park. The caves have a year round temperature of 55 degrees. With the outdoor temperatures over 90, the coolness of the cave sounded attractive. Even though we arrived after noon on a Sunday without reservations, we were able to pick from several tours with a short wait. We decided to try the Historic Tour. We are older parents of a 7 yr old and a 6 year old. We knew that there were many stairs on this tour, but Fat Man's Misery & Tall Man's Misery are always memorable for kids. As we approached the Historic Tour opening to the cave, the temperature began to drop dramatically. Our guides were well versed on cave lore and kept the crowd of about 100 entertained and moving along the route. One older women was led out of the cave by the second ranger because she had not realized that there were so many stairs to climb on this tour.Due to tightened security, purses & bags are not allowed in the caves. You can take a camera & bottled water.The lodge is a great place to cool off, eat a meal or spend the night. One Kentucky arts gift shop and one typical souvenier gift shop are located in the lodge. The bookstore is in the main park building where the tickets are purchased. There are also vintage cabins to stay in or a nice national park campground. We picniced at a table near an overlook. The deer were plentiful wandering around the roadways. Use caution because of the deer population while driving through the park.","August 23, 2007",a cool adventure on a hot day,55,"Owensboro, Kentucky",5

Mammoth Cave,"We took the Historical Tour of Mammoth Cave and found it to be awesome and educational. Our guide was quite knowledgeable and we found the early history and exploration of the cave to be quite interesting.However, keep in mind that this is a cave, not a limestone cavern, so if you come here expecting to see stalagmites and stalactites, you will be disappointed. Putting that aside, however, Mammoth Cave is a fantastic geological wonder that should be appreciated for what it is, not what it isn't.Be sure to make reservations for the tour you want - this can be done on the web. Since it was a weekday in early May when we visited, we didn't and our selected tour was sold out. However, the two hour wait for the next tour did allow us to see some of the park that we would otherwise have missed. Also, I would suggest bringing your own flashlight since the lighting on the tour is not that good in some areas. A jacket is also a definite requirement. The park warns you that the tour is somewhat strenuous, and this warning should be taken seriously.","May 26, 2007",A must-see geological wonder!,51,"Vermilion, Ohio",4
Mammoth Cave,"My feelings are a little mixed on Mammoth Cave. I have been twice and loved it both times. Going down in the caves is awesome and a good time. I like going on the guided tours because the guides give you good info and its fun being a big group as well. However, i wish there was some independent exploration avaiable. There is none. I know the reasons, liability for people getting hurt and money. The cave tours are not cheap, but worth it. This place is awesome and when you go, use the camp site, it is cheap and you can walk to the are where the tours begin.G Man","April 8, 2007",Definately a place worth checking out!!,306,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5
Mammoth Cave,"Just got back from a trip to Mammoth Cave. Stayed at the new Comfort Inn and Suites. Very clean and nice. Indoor pool was a little chilly. Diamond Cave was the best! A must see! We also took the Historic Tour, Travertine, and Violet Lantern tours at Mammoth Cave. The historic tour was great, Travertine was short and so-so for the money. The Violet Lantern tour was cool because it is all by lantern. Pretty cool. We also hiked around the park some. Cave City was pretty boring. A lot of stuff was closed down and run down. We did ride the Alpine slide the day we left. Pretty fun, but there was no control of when people were let down the slide and we had kids about run into us. Hiking and caves were a plus, the rest was not so great. The 2 restaurants at the park are good and well priced. Cracker Barrell was also good. (as always)","November 27, 2006",Great Getaway!,69,East Peoria,4
Mammoth Cave,"I have been to a few other caves in the United States but this one reigns supremacy. What an amazing site!Mammoth Cave is the world's largest cave. My family and I took a 2 hour Historic Cave Tour and were not disappointed. There were 2 rangers with us, only 1 talked however and the other 1 came up the rear to make sure no one got lost. The walk through the cave was great with so many formations and cool temperature throughout on a hot summer day. The tour guide was very knowledgable about the history and formation of the cave. Fat Man's Misery was humorous. Weaving in and out of tight spaces and ducking from low-lying ceilings was fun. Bottomless Pit was a sight to see and Mammoth Dome was interesting as well.Make sure to buy your tickets many days before you visit because tours can, and will, sell out. The only downside to this area was that it was very crowded. A huge tourist destination in the middle of nowhere Kentucky. I will definately return to Mammoth Cave National Park and this time I will take a longer cave tour. This is definately not for anyone who is scared of closed in places! Also, make sure you have your kids close to you, because there are some places where they can wander off.Expect to walk and enjoy the sites.","August 21, 2006",Incredible Experience,224,"Marlton, New Jersey",5
