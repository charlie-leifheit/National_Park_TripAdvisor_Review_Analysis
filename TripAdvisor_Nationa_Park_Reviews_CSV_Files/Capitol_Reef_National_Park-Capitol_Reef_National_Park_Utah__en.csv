Capitol Reef National Park,"Drove from Canyon lands to Capital Reef, my last National Park in Utah, having seen 4 National Park in less than 34 hrs excluding Zion (been to it before). It took 2hr 30 minutes to get there about 145miles. Driving past farms and green lands was so breakthrough taking, especially after having experienced the desert side of Utah. It’s free to enter capital Reef, drove till where the dirt road starts and decided to head back out since it was getting dark, scenic drive is 25 miles round trips.

Capitol Reef National Park,After Zion and Byrce I was afraid I would be let down with other parks but each one was uniquely spectacular. Capital Reef was let crowded which made the hiking even more fun.,"October 17, 2019",Big 5 Utah Parks are a must,0,,5
Capitol Reef National Park,"We were only here for a day trip, but we felt like it was the perfect amount of time. Upon arrival, we stopped by Panoramic Point, which was an awesome intro to the park. We then went to the Visitors Center to get a map, advice from the park rangers, and free water refills. We did Hickman Bridge (which was SO gorgeous and would be a great hike for the whole family) and Cassidy Arch (which was also SO gorgeous, but more strenuous than Hickman Bridge!), both of which we would definitely recommend for first-timers! We probably spent about 5.5 hours in the park before needing to drive back home. Even though Capitol Reef NP is out of the way, it's well worth the drive! FYI: If you have Verizon, you won't have service for most of the drive from SLC - Capitol Reef. If you have AT&T, you'll have more service than Verizon, but it's still really spotty for most of the drive.","October 15, 2019",Hickman Bridge & Cassidy Arch,60,"Virginia Beach, Virginia",5
Capitol Reef National Park,Third national park on our road trip thru southern Utah to do the Mighty Five. Not one of the better ones in my opinion. Highlight was the drive through the gorge on a very bumpy dirt road. Quite amazing to experience the magnitude and height of the rocks as you drive through the gorge. I would say if u go it is worth checking out.,"October 14, 2019",3rd of the Mighty Five,98,"Fort Myers, Florida",4
Capitol Reef National Park,"Stopped here for a full day between Bryce and Zion. We were not disappointed. We hiked near Chimney rock and Hickman Bridge.

Capitol Reef National Park,We drove the capitol gorge drive and the visitor center clerk told us it is like driving through a slot Canyon for your car. It was very scenic.

Capitol Reef National Park,"This was our 5th of the Big Five National Parks (Bryce & Zion in August 2001, and Arches and Canyonlands October 2019). What my wife and I enjoy about Utah's National Parks are their uniqueness among each other. CRNP is different while providing more than enough areas that are pleasing to the eyes, plenty of options to hike and traverse the various areas of the park, or simply just take the drive and see out your car window. Regardless, it is a beautiful National Park and is worthy of your visit to see in-person.","October 10, 2019",Our final of the Big 5 Utah National Parks,199,New Jersey,5

Capitol Reef National Park,"We knew absolutely nothing about Capitol Reef so a trip to the Visitor Centre was key. We learned a great deal about the area and found this park to have more of a personal touch. Not as huge and magnificent as Bryce or Arches, but smaller and more “manageable”, especially if you’re not a hiker (which I’m not), with equally as stunning views. The roads weren’t as “manicured” as in other parks, nor were there great, wide pull-offs, but we enjoyed it very much. We ","October 9, 2019",Beautiful views,179,"Waverley, Canada",4
Capitol Reef National Park,"We did Utah's Mighty 5, Mesa Verde, Monument Valley, and Grand Canyon.This was by far my favorite park. I think it has something to do with the orchards and the stargazing night. We went on the full moon hike as well.Zion and Mesa Verde would come in a close second and would love to explore those more. CRNP has a lot of different hikes to go on plus fruit picking for the families. The Gifford House was really small but very cute. Great homemade ice cream.Torrey and CRNP are Dark Skies status so plan to visit during the full moon for hiking or new moon for photography or star gazing. We can't wait to go back and explore many other options we missed out on.","October 9, 2019",I wasn't expecting it to be my favorite,32,"Murrieta, California",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef National Park is one of a kind and is probably the stop where we learned the most, because we initially knew the least. Definitely worth the stop and scenery as varied as any park we’ve seen. The Visitor Center is an essential stop and a stop at Fruita adds a human element. We decided the key to CRNP was to try to throughly understand the geology of the area. A stop at the Visitor Center is essential, but certainly we weren’t alone with that thought. And, BTW, this is a very good Visitor Center. ","October 7, 2019","Capitol Reef, the Least Known of the Big 5",483,"St. Petersburg, Florida",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"If traveling to Utah's Major Five, Capitol Reef may not knock your socks off like Bryce or Arches but it will educate you beyond measure.The film at the visitors center is full of both the geological and the human history of the area. There is also a scenic drive with gorgeous vistas famous in this part of Utah for those (like us) that can't hike. On Utah highway 24 in the park is an orchard planted by early Mormon settlers. The park rangers still maintain the orchard and even provide ladders for visitors to pick fruit with an honor box to pay for your harvest.","October 6, 2019",Rich with geological and human history,57,"Topeka, Kansas",5

Capitol Reef National Park,"I’m still trying to wrap my head around the notion that all these canyons can be so different! This park is so unique! The community of Fruita is a focus and you can pick fruit, visit a restored home where you can buy a pie made from the local fruit, or visit a park as well as hike and camp.

Capitol Reef National Park,"We arrived early in the afternoon. We knew we were early for check in but have always been accommodated in some fashion at other hotels: Sorry, your room isn’t ready yet but please make use of our amenities. And you can check back at 3 if you like. We can’t promise but your room might be ready early.But at Capitol Reef Resort the supervisor at the front desk said impolitely that we would need to come back at 4 pm. There were a total of five cars in the parking lot so it was clear the hotel was not going to be full that night. We returned at 3:30 to find a very different, friendly and welcoming staff at the front desk. She was checking guests in. What a difference it would have made had she been staffing the front desk when we first arrived.The room was very adequate and clean with a beautiful view, but the WiFi was sporadic and inadequate. If we were to be in Torrey again we would try another motel.","September 25, 2019",Disappointed by lack of welcome,0,,3

Capitol Reef National Park,"My husband and I stumbled upon this park by mistake. I booked a hotel in Torrey not realizing that the Capitol Reef was just around the corner. With directions from the hotel front desk we found this gem. We started the morning early, 7am, which was perfect. Very few people were out. We were surprised by the lack of people. We are used to Yosemite and Grand Canyon crowds. This NP was quiet and spacious. We found the perfect hammock spot across from the visitor center next to a running creek. We continued our drive thru the park and were amazed at the beauty and lack of people. I wish I had come more prepared to hike longer trails but was pleasantly pleased with the small aventures we took.","September 21, 2019",Beautiful with limited people,60,"Bakersfield, California",5

Start your trip with a stop at the visitor's center to see the video on the geography of the park, and listen to a ranger talk if you have the time.

I definitely recommend this park.,"September 18, 2019",A real gem of a Park,117,"Olathe, Kansas",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"We went to Capitol Reef on a trip where we visited five other national parks and it was by far the least crowded. It must be because the park is a little further off the beaten path. Like some of the less popular national parks, the visitor’s center is small. However, it is a very informative center and the rangers are extremely helpful with identifying good hikes and places within the park to visit. Definitely visit the house where you can buy freshly made personal size pies. I highly recommend them all! ","September 14, 2019",Fantastic (and uncrowned) Park! ,48,"Santa Paula, California",5

Capitol Reef National Park,Besides Capitol Reef we visited Arches and Canyonlands on the same trip. Capitol Reef was our favorite. The beautiful sandstone formations of the reef were all around us. For easterners it is hard to comprehend the vastness and beauty of the area. You could try to describe it and even show photos to your family and friends back home but nothing could do it justice other than to experience it in person. The Mormon history of the Fruita community just adds to the enchantment. There are many trails to hike and scenic roads to drive over. This is a photographers paradise. There is no one way to enjoy the park but a few suggestions: (1) visit the visitor center for the exhibits and especially the film to learn about the area. They also have a nice gift shop. The rangers on duty will answer all your questions. Restrooms with flush toilets are located here. (2) Take time to see the Fruita Historic District. Pick seasonal fruit from the orchards (3) Drive the park scenic road and Utah Rt. 24 which follows the Fremont River through the reef. (4) Hike a few trails to get a personal feel for the landscape. Depending on the time of year you visit you will want sunscreen and a hat. Bring food and water and have plenty of gas in your vehicle as there are no services in the park area. Water and soda is available at the visitor center. Visiting here will make memories for a lifetime.,"September 10, 2019","Amazing, Beautiful and Overwhelming Geology",172,"Milford, Delaware",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"We had a great time at this place, a much needed reprieve from the heavy traffic at other parks. While I was tailgated by a rental on the first mile or so of the South Draw road, they opted not to cross the creek, and we didn't see another person or vehicle for hours. The views were excellent, and the trail offered adequate challenge for a mostly stock vehicle. You wind up in the National Forest where you can camp pretty much anywhere without having to see or hear traffic. This was the only National Park of several I actually enjoyed.","September 8, 2019",More than just hiking trails,29,"Odessa, Texas",5

Capitol Reef National Park,"I think that most people stay at or near the north end of the park, which is beautiful but nothing really unique for Utah. Beautiful canyons and rock formations, and orchards, established originally by pioneers. But, other parks are more spectacular, ie Zion, Bryce, Snow Canyon (similar) etc. BUT, having read about one of the main features of the park, The Water Pocket Fold, we decided to spend a day exploring that area. And WOW, it was spectacular! The road was dirt, washboard part of the time, but easily done with 2 wheel drive and average clearance. We made the loop which ends in Boulder and also takes you through the Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument. To do that you leave the road at the Burr Trail, which is stunning! It is very steep and the switchback corners are tight. The signs recommend short trailers, but I think you’d have to be crazy to do it with a trailer, and heaven help you if you met a car coming the other direction. There are a few wide places, but backing up would be scary. I LOVED IT, but it is a bit of an adventure. This loop alone is worth a trip to Capitol Reef. HIGHLY RECOMMEND","September 3, 2019","Water pocket fold, amazing!",4,,5
Capitol Reef National Park,This is definitely the least known N.P. of Utah but it is really beautiful. Didn't know much about it and only spent about a half day but the multi colorful rocks and cliffs were a nice break from all the red that makes up the other 4 UT parks.

Capitol Reef National Park,"One thing you must do before heading in is to get food and drinks. We thought we could have lunch here but they only sell pie and ice cream. Don't get me wrong the pie was delicious but it was weird that no sandwiches were sold.Spent a day and a half in the park. It is beautiful but it is no Zion or Bryce. The wash road was an excellent drive but have AWD and watch for the weather. No car would be able to transverse after a rainfall you would need an ATV, Jeep or Hummer. The ancient art walk is cool as well as several other hiking areas. We went with a 3/4 moon so the night was a little disappointing because there is minimum light pollution but we had moon light pollution.One thing I liked was it was not that crowded and we were there on a Saturday and Sunday.","August 28, 2019",Pleasent and Beautiful,23,Connecticut,4
Capitol Reef National Park,"This park has it all: an interesting history, low crowds, amazing views, and a cute town (Torrey) nearby. It is a little off the beaten track, but worth the stop. We spent three nights here and could have stayed longer. If you have the stamina, you must hike up to Cassidy Arch. The views are incredible. The Fremont River trail is also wonderful and if you hike all the way to the top, you will see more amazing views. We stopped by the homestead and bought apple and strawberry rhubarb pies. Both were excellent. Go first thing in the AM, they will still be warm. Also, I heard they do run out by mid day. Park admission is by honor system only, please stop in the visitors center and pay the fee to support this gem!","August 27, 2019",My new favorite National park,36,"Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"Middle of the way park, not too crowded and zooish like Zion, Bryce, and Arches but a bit more crowded than Needles… And unlike Arches NP, people here were very kind to the environment and to each other’s. The campground was quiet and super clean even when full to capacity.The colors of this land stimulate your senses. Vibrant palette of colors spilling across the landscape, hues constantly shifting by the change of light against the towering sandstone cliffs, massive domes, soaring monoliths, deep canyons, alcoves, hidden arches and bridges.Visit the Fruita Settlement with the Gifford Homestead, a school, orchards, some petroglyphs (by the Fremont Indians – which I had never heard of before), and a blacksmith shop. The homestead has a store offering freshly baked pies, breads (even sourdough), cinnamon rolls. Some ice-cream too. In the 3000-tree orchard, you are free to eat what is in season while in the orchard or pay $1/# or $20/bushel (50#) if you want to pick and go. Almonds, pecans, apples, pears, peaches, apricots, quince, cherries, plums. So many fruits that it makes the local deer sick eating so much sugar instead of their regular grass-based diet. In Wayne County, UT – hence why it was called Wayne Wonderland or the Land of Sleeping Rainbow because of the contrasting multi-colored leaning sandstones surrounded by green river bands and arid desert vegetation all tucked under deep blue skies.Now named from the great white rock formation which resembles the US Capitol building and from the sheer cliffs that presented a barrier (reef) to early travelers. This ‘reef’ is called the Waterpocket Fold and is 100 miles (160 km) long. It seemed impenetrable. Waterpocket Fold was the last territory to be charted in the contiguous 48 states! Thankfully, because you have to hike to much of what can be visited, it remains fairly quiet to see arches, canyons, rivers, etc. It can get quite warm here as it is tucked away between tall cliffs with possibly little air movement. Be prepared.","August 25, 2019",Can see why it was the last territory to be charted in the contiguous 48 states.,324,Canada,5
Capitol Reef National Park,"This national park was spectacular with the fact that it had a different flavor from Zion and Bryce. It wasn’t too crowded when we visited. Since we only had a few hours, we drove the scenic tour, viewed the petroglyphs, stopped at the Gifford house for yummy fruit pies, saw the Capitol dome, and hiked the trail to Hickman Bridge (which took most of our time but definitely worth it)! We were going to pick some fruit at the fruit orchards, but after the Hickman Bridge hike, we were out of time and had to return to our hotel.

Use the park website to plan ahead based on your time to spend at the park, health condition, preferred activities, etc. The Fruita district offers seasonal fruits for the picking but we were a couple wks from apricot harvest so lucked out. Lots of Mormon history to re-live & appreciate their struggles & triumphs. Many trails to explore depending on your condition & time of day to visit as it’s hot in summer. The red rocks in this area glow at sunrise or sunset so the views are incredible all around. There are various scenic overlooks from the car where you don’t even have to hike at all.

Certain orchards are open to the public at different times of the year and you are allowed to pick the fruit and eat it for free inside the orchards. You can buy some of the fruit to take with you. Overall a pleasant surprise and would love to come back when different fruits are in season.,"July 19, 2019",Cute park!,7,"Jonesboro, Arkansas",5

Capitol Reef National Park,We rode our SxS’s as far as was allowed on the trails that back up to Capital Reef. There’s a beautiful overlook and also hiking options. We didn’t hike but just enjoyed the views. A few days later we went to the actual park. We did a few small hikes but mostly drove thru to tour it. Really liked the scenic drive and that the park wasn’t too crowded. The fruit trees were a nice surprise to see after seeing all the rock formations. We stopped at Gifford House for pie at the end of the day but they were mostly sold out. We opted for homemade cookies instead. A highlight of the day was seeing the deer come out of the woods to feed. Nice site as we exited this smaller but beautiful park. ,"July 13, 2019",Beautiful ,49,"Estero, Florida",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"This is a true find. You will be so very pleased to have visited this out-of-the-way and gorgeous park. It has very few visitors compared to the other national parks in Utah due to its relative remoteness from freeways, compactness, and nondescript, small town (Torrey) outside it (as opposed to Moab, etc.). There are accessible trails in and above the eroded clefts and you can easily marvel at pictographs.The more spectacular approach is from the west, which is where Torrey is located (about 15 miles away).","July 11, 2019",Tiny Gem of a Park,57,"Newberg, Oregon",5

We were able to catch the Ranger talk about the petroglyphs and wandered through the orchard. We caught a really hot day and didn't make it to the Hickman Bridge Trail but I would add this to the ""must do"" list if I ever make it back. This is a great stop if you can fit it in.

It has hiking trails, scenic drives, a beautiful campground, a small country store and bakery (get there early), horses (not to ride but they add to the ambiance!). Definitely take the off-road scenic drives if weather and vehicle permit. Camp at Fruita campground if you can.

The road can be a little rough but if you take your time, it's fine. If storms go through the area, the roads can flood.The petroglyphs are simply wonderful--and big! Keep going along the walkways for more hidden ones on the path.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Each of the Utah five seem to have something different to offer. Capitol reef was the least crowded of the five, which made our day that much more enjoyable. As you enter the park and drive up to the visitor center you are already in awe of the cliffs, rocky terrain, and majestic colors. This park is perfect for touring as you don't have to hike to the locations, rather you can just pull off the scenic road for pictures. Our first stop was the visitor's center, where you view the informative movie to get the background of the park. Then you partake on your own tour driving through the several mile scenic road which ends at Capitol Gorge, where the road turns to dirt for the hearty vehicles. Each turn of the scenic road offers new speculator sights, and most times with little traffic to interfere with your moment of appreciation. Based on your travel itinerary, be sure to visit the Fruita area either on your way or on the return trip from the Gorge. The history of the area is fascinating, and a stop at the Gifford house for a fresh baked individual pie is almost mandatory to complete your Capitol Reef visit.","June 17, 2019",We loved Capitol Reef - Easy touring park,240,"Pittsgrove, New Jersey",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"For a place that we had not heard about prior to planning this particular trip, Capitol Reef certainly was a beautiful, impressive place. Compared to the other national parks in the region, this one is definitely smaller and has less to do. That said, it was stunningly beautiful and 100% without a doubt worth the visit.Would-be visitors should make a point of doing at least one of the walking / hiking trails. They get you off the beaten path of the cars (which were not all that numerous to begin with) and put you directly into contact with the beauty that is Capitol Reef.A few things to note about visiting here:1. Once you get past the visitor's center, there are no services in the park.2. Bring snacks and water with you BEFORE you enter the park. None are available once you're there.3. Even on a day that starts off bright and sunny, by mid/late afternoon, there is almost always a good chance of showers or rainstorms. The weather changes REALLY quickly here.4. Cell phone service is very limited throughout the entire park. Expect to have no reception whatsoever, because that is how it is in most of the park.","June 17, 2019",stunningly beautiful and absolutely worth the visit,77,"Silver Spring, Maryland",5

The best advice for a limited visit time.We've had 2 days to explore and be in awe.Gas can be filled in Torrey before entering the park.As for water - u can refill bottles at the visitors center. To purchase them, u can do that in Torrey or the museum store (close to the campground). Always have more than you need, especially if u intend to drive to the Cedar Mesa Campground area.First day - we drove to Cedar Mesa Campground, to find a spot. If u can't find one, u can go with dispersed camping. There are a lot of options. The rangers at the visitors center can point them out for u on the map.We've arrived at the campground round 1230 pm and half an hour later, all the spots were taken.The campground doesn't have shade in the day light and bugs rule during the heat, which is extremely annoying.When the night and the wind comes, they are gone.After putting our tent up, we were ready for hiking. The drive in this area is on dirt roads.

The Narrows there are really narrow and it's amazing.2nd hike **Surprise Canyon Route**3rd hike **Red Canyon Trail and Route**Departs from the campground.Second DayDrove back to the visitors center for a water refill and started the scenic drive.It's the only part of the park that requires an entrance fee 20$ or the national parks annual permit.It is definitely a scenic drive, absolutely breathe taking.We've hiked the **Cassidy Arch** which I highly recommend.Finished at **Hickman Bridge**I'm sure I'll be back for more Questions are welcomeHave fun‍♀️‍♂️‍♀️‍♂️‍♀️‍♂️","June 13, 2019",Hidden Gem***Nature's ArtWork***Go and Explore,65,"Los Angeles, California",5

Although I have visited most of the National Parks on the West side and Central portions of our wonderful country, Capitol Reef was unknown to me. Fortunately, I went and discovered the moment you turn onto Highway 24 from Torrey Utah, you are surrounded by GRANDEUR. The red rock formations are everywhere. You don't have to go through a gate after paying a ranger. Most of the vast park is if free of charge. However, you will find, just after the visitor center, along the scenic byway, that there is a payment area-on the honor system.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef National Park is approximately 60-miles long and just 6-miles wide on average. The park was established in 1971 to preserve 378 sq. miles of desert landscape and is open all year. A 20-mile Scenic Road crosses the park at one of the wider points. The park is roughly 112 miles from Bryce along UT Hwy. 12.Capitol Reef is all about the Waterpocket Fold. Long ago, there was a major geological shift in western North America, which reactivated an ancient underground fault. This fault moved and the pressure was such that the over-lying rock layers were pushed up, bent, and draped into a monocline. This fold is a 100-mile long fold-over in the earth’s surface, like soft taffy. There are numerous eroded basins or ‘pockets’ that hold rainwater and snowmelt like small ponds, resulting in a rich community of flora and fauna. The Waterpocket Fold is the main feature of Capitol Reef, but it is visible mostly in the far southeastern part of the park which is not accessible by street type cars. Capitol Reef gets the ‘capitol’ part of its name from large white Navajo Sandstone domes that, to the early settlers, resembled the US Capitol Dome in Washington DC. ‘Reef’ for the rocky cliffs that are a barrier to travel, in the same way that an ocean reef is. We found the rock formations and the colors outright amazing and enjoyed this different look at a mountain and valley landscape.Bring good hiking shoes if you venture off the pavement. 'Slick Rock' is all over and is descriptively named. There are no rest facilities in the park except near the Visitor Center area, near Fruita, which is quite crowded, and no drinking water either. The rocks hold in the heat so it can be deceptively warm. Plan ahead sun protection also.","June 2, 2019",Capitol Reef is all about the Waterpocket Fold,532,"Phoenix, Arizona",4
Capitol Reef National Park,"Highway 24 runs right through the park and will give you many fantastic views, but take some time to explore. Stop at the visitor center, watch the film, and then take the Scenic Drive. The first 8 miles of the drive are paved and will take you to incredible views at a pace of 25 mph or less, where the pavement ends you can continue another 2 miles on a gravel road that is rough and narrow demanding speeds less then 10 mph. Not many people do this, and that is good because the parking area at the end is not large, but if you do it you will have the opportunity to do some hiking on a relatively easy trail right down the middle of the canyon. I did it and would do again.","May 31, 2019",Take time to explore a little more,84,"Orlando, Florida",5

There is the school and a cabin you can visit. The park also has a petroglyphs from the Native Americans that lived there long before the Mormons.

Sadly, somebody just before us got the last pie. We did however find a freezer full of $1 ice cream and their bags of homemade chocolate chip cookies which was a nice treat while watching the horse at the barn.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Went with my 14 year old son over spring break this year. I thought nothing would beat Arches from last year’s spring break, but I’d have to say the beauty of Capitol Reef surpasses it. And it’s not as crowded, neither is the town of Torrey where it’s located. I would have to say it’s more of a “hikers” park than Arches though as many things can’t be seen from the parking areas or via a short walk. But none of the hikes we did were difficult or scary, just take your time if it’s not an activity you normally engage in. Both CR and the town of Torrey are truly a getaway from the everyday grind of traffic and people to just soak in and appreciate nature. The only con: absolutely zero cell signal after you get a little past the welcome sign. Other parks I’ve been to have intermittent signals every so often but this had none.

Capitol Reef National Park,"We have been to quite a few national parks and Capitol Reef is clearly the worst one ever! It is so terrible that I decided to register an account to make a comment here.There are almost nothing fun in the park. An elementary school closed in 1940s can be labeled as a place of interest? Couple small paintings on rock are considered as an attraction? The creek is completely dried up, and a few extremely boring trails that can only be accessed by driving through 10+ miles of unpaved road. BTW, the roads are so narrow that you need to drive with great caution to avoid hitting other cars.My kids kept complaining about this boring park and they even refused to get off the car after getting disappointed couple times by the so-called attractions. BTW, I would highly recommend you visit the Goblin Valley state park near Capitol Reef. Goblin Valley is great even though it is not as famous and popular as Arches National Park.

Capitol Reef National Park,"While not as popular and easy to get to as the other National Parks in Utah, Capitol Reef is still a beautiful destination with beautiful scenery. We drove into the park from Torrey and into the scenic drive. Along the drive, there are turnouts you can stop at to view the scenery. There is a page on the official NPS site that I recommend bringing along that gives details of the various stops along the way. I found most of the scenery requires you to look east making it better viewed in the afternoon. The scenic drive continues into Capitol Gorge where the road becomes unpaved. We did not venture into that part but we did see many vehicles going into the gorge. There is a large parking area before entering into Capitol Gorge that you can turnaround. The Fruita district near the start of the scenic drive also has orchards and historical buildings that you can visit if you are interested. Note that while there is a Visitor’s Center with a small gift shop, we did not see any dining establishments in the park.

However, Capitol Reef, which is less crowded than the other big-name parks, also has the absolutely stunning green valley of the Fremont River, with its pioneer settlement and fruit trees. This is where the visitors center is and where the scenic drive begins. It's the perfect place for a picnic lunch before setting out on the hikes that make this park so interesting.

We knew it was an under-appreciated park and thought we would have the place to ourselves but visited it during Utah's statewide fall break, but that somehow made it more interesting to see how the locals were enjoying it over the more famous parks, right along with us.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef National Park in south-central Utah is isolated, hot, arid, rugged and forbidding. But it also is beautiful and rewarding. Apparently many people agree. More than 1.2 million people have visited the park in 2018, nearly twice as many as have visited nearby Canyonlands. Established as a National Monument in 1937, opened to the public in 1950 and designated a National Park in 1971, Capitol Reef covers 241,904 acres of desert landscape. It is 60 miles long and an average of six miles wide. It is located close to the town of Torrey (population: 200), about 11 miles west of the Capitol Reef visitors center on Highway 24, slightly west of its intersection with Highway 12. The park was named for the whitish Navajo Sandstone cliffs with dome foundations, similar to white domes often placed on capitol buildings, that run from the Fremont River to Pheasant Creek on the Waterpocket Fold. It is the name for an especially rugged and spectacular segment of the Waterpocket Fold by the Fremont River. The Waterpocket Fold is a rocky spine extending from Thousand Lake Mountain to Lake Powell. It is a warp in the earth's crust that is 65 million years old, the largest exposed monocline in North America. Today, State Route 24 cuts through the park east and west between Canyonlands and Bryce Canyon National Park. Capitol Reef is filled with canyons, cliffs, towers, domes and arches. Most of the park is arid desert country. A scenic drive shows visitors some of the highlights but it runs only a few miles from the main highway. Hundreds of miles of trails and unpaved roads lead the more adventurous into the equally scenic backcountry. The land is isolated, hot, arid, rugged and forbidding. People come and go. Towns rise and are abandoned. Fremont culture Native Americans lived in the area in 1,000 AD, then left in the 13th century after a long drought. Mormons settled in the Fremont River Valley in the 1880s. They established three towns. None survives. Popular tourist destinations in the park include Hickman Bridge, Golden Throne, Capitol Gorge and Capitol Dome.","October 18, 2018","Arid, rugged and forbidding--but beautiful",4679,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"FYI See my other review for the pie date- worth it! 280 million years sure is magical especially with someone you love. I write reviews specifically for seeing and enjoying the world with someone you love. This is one of the dates you NEED another person as a witness to corroborate the splendor and majesty of nature. It is a WOW and I recommend LOTS of camera life and late afternoon sun to light up the park. If you happen to have a geology nut their head could explode with pure geek joy. The history of the earth displayed in layers and layers of rock and you realize how little time we are in the world. Do not go in the rain it will be a mud fiasco and there is no way to keep the car clean in dry weather so just give in to the experience and plan of getting in and out of the car a hundred times. Every age person will climb about and snap pictures that make you look like an ant, and in this case it is not just probable, they are FUNTASTIC to take. If it is dry you can sneak back to the echo cliffs on a secret little road that is marked and feels like you are on another planet.

The area south of the visitor center does not offer much to those who are driving a car....goes to a gravel road fairly quickly. The orchards and history of the area did not seem enough to justify National Park status.

Capitol Reef National Park,"After visiting the other national parks in Utah, my expectations for Capitol Reef were not high. I fully expected it to be overshadowed by the other parks. Not so. We tried to do a variety of things in one day. Started by driving out to Cathedral Valley from the Cainville turnoff. The road was an adventure for sure, but nothing a high clearance vehicle can't handle easily. Absolutely awesome, and no one there but me and my wife. Dead silence and very nice in the early morning light. We then drove into the park and visited the Gifford House where we bought a pie and ice cream. Sat at a picnic table and enjoyed visiting with tourists from England. The whole place was so peaceful and quiet. Not crowded at all. We then drove down the scenic road to the Grand Wash and hiked up the Cassidy Arch Trail to the arch and back. Relatively strenuous hike for being so short...very enjoyable and not crowded at all. Finished by driving down the rest of the scenic road and driving up the Capitol Gorge road to the parking lot. After one day in Capitol Reef, I realize that we could easily have spent a week there because there are so many trails and driving tours to choose from.

Capitol Reef National Park,"I enjoy hiking, but my wife cannot. So, when we travel around the country, I have to forgo hiking at all of these great places, and enjoy the more touristy view from a vehicle, with a few short walks or pull out stops. With that said, Capitol Reef was excellent. A nice visitor center. Clean restrooms. Plenty to see and do. Although the rocks here are still red, as they are in much of Utah, they were different than other places. Because we were scheduled to be a distance away by the end of the day, we didn't have time to explore as much as we could, so we passed on the scenic drive. I could tell just from the visitor center and driving through the park, that this would be a great place for a hike. But it was also a great place for a scenic drive along the main road.One advantage to this park is the lesser number of people present than some of the other parks in Utah (and they have more than their share!) and given that it was past Labor Day, it was even less than usual. It's a great time to travel if you can.","September 25, 2018","Still a great place, even if you don't hike",152,,5

There’s a short walk along a walkway, outside the scenic drive area where you can view the petroglyphs. This walk is very easy and flat.

We stopped at the Visitor Center the day before we were going to the park and got good advice: go to Capitol Gorge first as early as you can and then to Grand Wash because both get crowded later in the day. The unpaved access roads are narrow and curvy, and the parking lots are small, so you also benefit from less traffic. The Grand Wash Trail has two access points: one from route 24 and one from the Scenic Drive. To avoid walking the trail twice (for a total of almost 4.5 miles), go halfway from each stop. The section from route 24 has more dramatic canyon passes, but the other section is also beautiful, just less dramatic. There are also many petroglyphs throughout the park.

The Highway 12 route through this area is something that has to be seen to be believed so stop often and have a long look around. We've not been bothered by large tour buses yet as we've visited this area, they seem to crush the path between Zions and Bryce Canyon but don't seem to make it here. Here's hoping things stay that way for a long time to come.There is plenty of hiking and lots of dirt roads to explore, or you can see much of the scenic points from paved roads. The camping seems a bit limited here, so plan ahead if your planning to camp here in the summer.","September 17, 2018",Beautiful days and star filled nights!,37,"Salt Lake City, Utah",5

It's like a little oasis in the midst of all the beautiful reds of the surrounding cliffs. Make sure to buy a fresh pie or 2 at the store. It was the BEST cherry pie I have ever eaten! The road that takes off from the Fruita area and heads south is a great way to see the best of the park. The paved road ends at a parking area/trailhead, but there is the option of continuing forward on a dirt road to more sites. The dirt road is a little rough in areas, but a good all wheel drive vehicle will make it fine and it is definitely worth the extra time and effort. There are more great hikes from the parking area/trail head at the end of the dirt road. The north end of the park, Cathedral Valley, is a must see also. It is on remote land, very sparsely traveled and is best accessed with a jeep tour company in my opinion. The road is pretty rough (washboard). We went on a tour and never saw another group...so relaxing, fun and beautiful. The Temples of the Sun and Moon were inspiring and Glass Mountain was so fascinating.","August 31, 2018",Make an effort to see this park!,32,"Fort Collins, Colorado",5

Capitol Reef is on the same level as the rest of them, if not better. Don't miss it!We drove through Capitol Reef on our way to Arches, not thinking we would stop. We were so blown away that we ended up turning off at the visitors center and drove the scenic drive. I'm still kicking myself for not spending the night somewhere and checking out the rest of the park to the south. This place is just MASSIVE. Something about it just blew me away and I couldn't get enough of the HUGE scenery. We drove the scenic drive and all you could hear in the car was ""WOW"" on repeat. There are two side roads (gravel dirt) off of the main drive and we took off down the second one (I don't recall the name, but I think another option was called Grand Wash) and I HIGHLY recommend doing this.

So we didn't really get the 'wow' effect as if this would have been the first Park ever seen.... It's nice, the scenic ride is impressive, the Capitol Gorge hike is 'special'. One peculiarity : as you enter the Park, there's an -unmanned- station where you need to stop and pay 15USD entrance fee. You need to fill in an envelope, put the 15USD in there and put it in some postbox. We did it but strange enough ALL other vehicles just drove on ... they stop, read it, and ... simply move on... Were we too naïve to pay the fee ? Or had all others permanent park passes ?

We also recommend the panorama point overlook. We did the goosenecks overlook and Sunset point trails. We also did the Capitol Gorge Trail hike for about a mile into the gorge, where you can see Native American petroglyphs as well as inscriptions by pioneer settlers from the late 1800s- early 1900s carved on the rock walls (caution: to get to the trail, there is about a 1.5 mile drive on an unpaved road that is hard on a car’s tires and alignment if you don’t drive very carefully.)We also enjoyed very much a stop at the Gifford House, where we bought two small delicious homemade pies, which we ate on the spot; one peach and one cherry.Capitol Reef is a must-do!","August 17, 2018","Beautiful, stunning, monumental rock formations",164,"Lambertville, New Jersey",5

My wife and I took the trail to Hickman Bridge while our daughter and son-in-law took the Cohab trail, which left in different directions from the same parking lot. Ours was a round trip and theirs went to the campground area. We planned to finish and meet them there. It was a hot day and the trail was more difficult than we expected so it took us much longer than expected. They arrived and waited for some time.

There are some great hikes but just nothing amazing like the other parks. This was on our way from Bryce Canyon to Moab so we swung in.

The night program we saw from Ranger Dina about lizards, frogs, and snakes was excellent. There was also a night sky program. You can see the Milky Way here it is so dark. The campground was nice and spacious. We went on three hikes: Grand Wash (it's flat and has interesting features as well as petroglyphs, the hike to Hickman Bridge/Arch (very sandy, not hard, cool echo at the bridge), and the hike up the creek to a water fall which was small enough to climb on top of.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Capital Reef was one of my favorite Utah National Parks. It is large, has an incredible history and it is not heavily visited. The Rangers we met were friendly and very informative. Since there were not many people there, they spent a lot of time with us. It is north between Arches and Bryce. The Native Indians of that region, the Fremont Indians were along the river and in the gorge from about the year 500 until 1700. For the last two hundred years, white settlers joined them and grew fruit there. So, there is a mix of orchard and indian carvings to see. The park gives out fruit to guests (apricots in season) before hikes because the history of park was as an orchard. We really enjoyed our visit to the Homestead house and the barn is a nice stop. They sell pie. My favorite drive and hike was the Capital Gorge, which was the original road into the area. Amazing panoramic views of the gorge are available right off the road from Goosenecks and Sunset Point.","June 28, 2018",One of my favorite Utah parks; interesting history and beautiful road and hikes,233,"Des Moines, Iowa",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"You can stop and explore or just stop and see the views from the main road cutting through the park. The geology is lovely. The campground fills up early by 11 a.m. If you want to stay there book in advance. It is a nice one with trees and good facilities, but drive-in early if you want a spot! They have easy to see to petroglyphs that you can stop and see. Enjoy the beauty!","June 27, 2018",Lovely drive at sunset,74,"Fort Collins, Colorado",4
Capitol Reef National Park,"The scenic drive with all of the stops was incredible. The awesome geology of the waterpocket fold is explained and right before your eyes. The offshoot roads were fun and exciting for this flat lander who has never been off-roading and was driving a rental Jeep. The Capitol gorge was neat, we saw some mountain goats. The old mines were boarded up but neat to explore. It took about 90 minutes and was not crowded.","June 26, 2018",Beautiful scenic drive,65,Libertyville,5
Capitol Reef National Park,"This was the 6th of 6 national parks that we visited in Utah so unfortunately we did not spend much time here.

Capitol Reef National Park,"I love this National Park. I'm almost reluctant to write a review, because I love the fact that there are so few people who visit. For those of us who are non-hikers and non-campers, there is a very pleasant paved 90-minute scenic drive off of Fruita. There is also at least one off-shoot on that scenic drive that is gravel and takes you back further into the canyon. The rock formations are spectacular, and you'll almost immediately see why it is called ""capitol dome."" If you keep going straight from Torrey, rather than going down into Fruita, you'll come across the Torrey schoolhouse (still furnished), an old cabin, and more terrific rock formations.The _only_ thing I wish is that they had more pull-outs off the scenic drive in particular. It's impractical to simply stop on the road and stare - even though there are very few vehicles driving through, if you stop somebody is bound to be on your bumper within a minute or two, usually right when you lift up the camera to take a photo.","June 11, 2018",My all-time favorite park,34,"Roy, Utah",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"First time we've been to Capitol Reef and don't think it'll be the last. The park is not as well known as the other National Parks in Utah but certainly worth the trip. It is a beautiful park with amazing rock formations. There are great hikes in the park including the Grand Wash and our favorite Hickman Bridge. Of course the best part of this park is no big crowds you find in the other parks. The other really terrific thing we liked about this park are the historic orchards and ranch. Our campground was surrounded by apricot trees which can be picked when ready. A herd of mule deer in the area also like the orchards as they roam free. You have to try the fresh cinnamon rolls and pies sold at the park. The visitor center is also quite commendable as it was desgned to perfectly blend in with the natural beauty of the park. And not to be missed is scenic highway 12 on the way to the park. According to the visitor center, it is the second most scenic highway in the world. I don't know about that but it is a beautiful drive. The entire visit was a magical experience!","June 10, 2018",Not as known but...,63,"Baywood Park, California",5

It took us about an hour longer than expected to get there because we stopped so many times along the back roads along the way to see the sights and take pictures' Route 24 was amazing especially through Dixie National Forest. We are seniors who can't do long hikes anymore like we used to so we did not spend as much time as we would have a few years ago. Got the pies at Gifford and picnicked at the beautiful park nearby.

We took the hike up to the natural bridge was a great hike but if you arent used to the altitude the hike up whooped me and my wife but the views far outweighed all of that.

Capitol Reef National Park,"My wife and I spent four nights at the Fruita Campground. The reservation system worked well. Zion and Arches were long booked up. While Capitol Reef was not our first choice, we discovered a gem of a park and had a great experience. The campground is shady and is a real oasis in the desert. There is a little store next door that sells pies and cinnamon rolls - very nice treats! The first day we hiked to Cassidy Arch and continued on via the Frying Pan trail to Cohab Canyon and back to the campground. I then road my bike back to the trailhead (three miles) to pick up my car. The next day we hiked Cottonwood Wash on the eastern side of the park. The first mike was a four-wheel drive road in the wash itself. Had I known that we would have biked that section and stashed our bikes at the trailhead, Cottonwood Wash was great. We saw only 4 other people! The third day we hiked Upper Muley Twist Canyon. It was a long drive to get there and we did use our bikes to ride the first three miles of the dry wash to get tot he trailhead. The drive and bike were worth it. The hike was great, and again, we saw only a handful of people. Will we go again? you bet!","May 24, 2018",Four Nights of Camping,19,"Denver, Colorado",5

There’s great hikes, historical perspective from the Mormon settlers, and great drives. Be sure your camera batteries are charged. Lots of animals - desert bighorn, mule deer, marmots, and mountain lions (though we did not see the cats). Can easily do much of what the park has to offer in 2-3 days.

Capitol Reef National Park,We hiked from 10:30am until nearly 6pm and were beat. The only reason for a four star is the trails are sometimes not well marked.

Capitol Reef National Park,"We live in Utah but hadn't been to Capitol Reef in years. We're so glad we went back for a couple of days. The raw beauty of the terrain is amazing. We took two good hikes in one day: Grand Wash and Hickman Bridge. Grand Wash is a fairly flat 4.5 mile round trip down a spectacular canyon. We did it from the park's Scenic Drive to Hwy 24 and back. You can do it the other way around if you want as there is parking, but no restroom, at the highway end. Hickman Bridge trail has a decent climb early but isn't too hard and you have a great loop under the natural arch. The view up there is fantastic.We also drove the Cathedral Valley loop in an afternoon. You need to have a vehicle with some clearance to do this safely. We used our Subaru Outback, so you know it's not a true 4WD trail. The loop is almost 60 miles around and takes at least 4 hours to complete. You go through some really interesting terrain and in Cathedral Valley the rock formations tower high over you. It's well worth doing if you've got the right car and the time.","May 18, 2018",Love Capitol Reef -- Must be a geologists dream to visit,16,"Taylorsville, Utah",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol reef suffers a lot by being surrounded by giants like Canyonlands, Arches, Bryce and Zion. On its own it would be a perfectly nice and beautiful park, but being among such spectacular neighbours make it feel like it's just the lesser brother.

Capitol Reef National Park,"This is one national park you can see alot of from Hwy 24, although we did go in to the actual paid area also. The scenic road is nice, but make sure you drive the 2 1/2 mi Capitol Gorge road - it is very scenic and has a two mile round trip easy trail. Also drive the just over a mile Grand Wash road. The Grand Wash trailat the end is just over 2 miles one way and is a downhill walk that ends on Hwy 24 if you don't want round trip. These side roads are both gravel but very drivable in any vehicle as long as there isn't a thunderstorm. The Fruita historic district, both in and out of the park proper, is worth spending some time at. Stop at the Gifford house early (before they run out of pie) and their souvenirs are unique. Out on Hwy 24, the Behunin cabin, the petroglyph panel and the Fruita schoolhouse are quick and interesting stops. Also off of Hwy 24 is the Goosenecks overlook and Sunset point which is a 1/2 mi one way easy trail.

We started at the Visitor Centre (about a 20 minute drive from the centre of Torrey). Once we’d got the maps we set off for the Hickman Bridge trail. Well worth it in the end. It’s classed as moderate because the path can be rocky and you go up about 400ft in total. After that, we had a picnic then did the Fremont river trail. After tea, we returned to the park to watch the sunset at Panorama Point and we waited until it was dark in order to view the Milky Way.

Upon entrance it is amazing and just gets better further you go on Rt 24. We have been to Sedona and Flagstaff Arizona and love the red sandstone. Capitol Reef as my wife remarked is Sedona on Steroids. The red mountains are huge. We availed of some hiking and scenic driving. We also stopped for the walk along the cliffs called Petroglyphs where drawings made by the Fremont or Ancient Pueblo Indians are.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Though the Mighty Five are all amazing, Capitol Reef is often skipped because it’s not as well known. DON’T SKIP IT! The geology that makes Southern Utah and Northern Arizona so amazing is shown off at Capitol Reef. There are fewer crowds, more trees, an orchard, a farm to explore and amazing vistas with beautiful colors on display. Highly recommend: Drive along Scenic Highway 12 to get from Zion to Capitol Reef. The road truly is awesome and will take you through many terrains, elevations, and ecosystems as you travel through the Grand Staircase. Tips:-This is a relatively small national park, so can easily be done in 1-2 days depending on how much hiking you do. For most people a morning arrival will allow you to see the highlights, then you can spend the night for the Dark Sky sights. -Since the crowd is much less here, even the most popular trails such Hickman Bridge and Grand Wash are not crowded. -This is a dark sky park so plan an overnight in the area and check for ranger telescope talks. -The Scenic Drive road is narrow, about a lane and a half for standard American roads, so be prepared to drive slowly and cautiously. The road also goes through many wash areas so don’t go down it when it’s raining. -There is no entrance fee until you enter the scenic drive. -The pies at the farm are delicious, and sell out quickly!

Petroglyphs, pioneer history and beautiful vistas from some of the trails were highlights. We wished we had a full day (we arrived at noon) to do some more exploring.

This park provides ample overhead views and ample opportunities to enjoy the canyon views. Please be cognizant of weather conditions as you visit. Driving or hiking in the canyons with pending inclement weather can be dangerous. If you follow any National Park website, warnings and advice are clearly stated to ensure your safety. This is not a bunch of words, but this is serious. Pay attention so that you can enjoy your trip and come back home to talk about it. The air here is the cleanest you will find....again, read the National Park website. The silence is beautiful. We did not find this park mobbed in early April. We were able to drive without traffic to any vista point. There are many stops for you to take in the history. Stop at the Gifford House for amazing pie, which turned out to be our lunch one day. Enjoy the setting of days long past and imagine yourself as a part of that past. Stop along the way to view the many orchards. In spring, it's beautiful to see the budding apple trees. Stop to admire the Petroglyphs on the mountainsides. If you open yourself to scenery you may feel the presence of those who wandered these roads thousands of years ago..This is a peaceful and spiritual place.

Capitol Reef National Park,"We have made two visits to Capitol Reef, about 30 years apart. On our most recent visit in September, we found it hasn't changed much - except it's definitely more crowded. This park is in a remote and rugged part of south-central Utah and is off the beaten path; on Utah State Route 24 about 60 miles south of I-70. Its most famous feature is the Waterpocket Fold, a huge wrinkle in the earth's crust that stretches almost 100 miles. The desert landscape is textured with deep red-rock canyons, towering cliffs and huge white sandstone domes.I would allow about a half-day to visit this park, longer if you want to hike. If you just want to drive through, UT24 follows the Fremont River through the park and it is a spectacular scenic route with some pull-outs on the shoulder for viewpoints and photo ops, including a panel of petroglyphs and rock formations along the road. Stop at the visitor center at Fruita near the center of the park on UT24 for maps, educational exhibits, restrooms, souvenirs and information about road and trail conditions (open daily). A pioneer family established a settlement at Fruita in the 1880s and it is now maintained and operated as a living museum. There are orchards that grow heirloom varieties of apples, peaches, cherries, plums, pears, apricots and almonds. It's free to sample the fruit in the orchard, or you can ""pick your own"" to take home for a very reasonable fee. The Fruita Historic District includes a schoolhouse, blacksmith shop and the Gifford House which operates as a pioneer history museum and store selling fresh baked goods and handcrafts (open mid-March through the end of October). The Ripple Rock Nature Center (summer only) offers educational programs and interactive activities. A campground and picnic area are available nearby. From Fruita, there is an 8-mile (one-way) scenic drive that starts south of the campground. The scenic drive is a paved two-lane road, but the other backcountry roads that connect to it are dirt and gravel so 4WD high-clearance vehicles are recommended on those (Grand Wash Road, Capitol Gorge Road and Pleasant Creek Road). It's free to drive through the park on UT24 and visit the Fruita Historic District, but entrance fees are collected for the scenic drive ($15/car or show NPS pass). There are numerous hiking trails in the park of varying lengths and difficulty from the easy .1-mile Goosenecks Trail to the strenuous 4.7-mile trek to Navajo Knobs. Unfortunately, none of the trails are wheelchair-accessible. There is no lodge or restaurant in this park, the nearest services are at the town of Torrey about 10 miles west of the park on UT24. The visitor center and Gifford House may have some pre-packaged snacks. The weather at Capitol Reef can be extreme and change suddenly; check the forecast and be prepared for intense sun and thunderstorms. A thunderstorm hit while we were visiting the park and there was flash-flooding. The washes started to run across the road and we were almost trapped on the scenic drive- it was scary because we had to drive through the rushing water to get out. The rangers had to close the road and retrieve some stranded vehicles with a heavy-duty flatbed truck. The positive side of the storm was that impromptu waterfalls started flowing off the canyon walls... so pretty! The park operates an automated phone recording about current road conditions: (435) 425-3791.","March 29, 2018",Gorgeous Desert Canyon Scenery and Pioneer History,1781,"Tucson, Arizona",4
Capitol Reef National Park,"My husband and I went here for the weekend. If you love to hike you will love this place. Bring WATER. Not just a 16oz bottle but load up. Bring snacks. We went in March and no crowds and the temp was cool. Perfect for hiking. Best hikes for us were the Chimney Loop and Cohab Canyon. Both are moderate/strenuous hikes for only 1/3 of the way up. But once you are at the top its easy and the views are breathtaking. Plus side - no crowd. Chimney hike loop will give you a overall view of Capital Reef. This gave us a great point of reference on what we needed to see for the rest of our trip. Cohab Canyon hike was my favorite. Once you are at the top you will be amazed at the picture perfect views. Then walk through the wash area with slot canyons on the side to explore. We hiked up till the overviews lookouts (breathtaking) then turned around and hiked back the way we came. You could continue the hike all the way to HWY 24. Hickman bridge is where we saw the most hikers. This is a moderate hike up but the trail is well groomed and manageable. The Bridge is amazing. If you really look you can see Native American corn storage area in the cliff on your way to the bridge.Capitol Gorge Trail is easy but you will get you vehicle dirty. Take the scenic drive till you get to the dirt road. We had our truck and no issues. On the dirt road you will drive through amazing ""Narrows"" before arriving to the trail head. While here we also hiked up to ""The Tanks"". This part of the hike was strenuous, and trails were not well marked. Seeing the tanks were cool but would not do it again. Grand wash trail is very easy. Your are hiking on flat sandy river bottom. About a mile down is where it starts to get amazing. Walking through the Narrows in some places 600 feet up. If you have a off road vehicle - I would highly recommend seeing the Gooseneck Overlook. Views are like the Grand Canyon. Straight down and river carved. There is a fence at one end where you can look down. If traveling with small children I would recommend going to the visitor center in Fruita first. They have ranger stuff for kids. Plus maps where they can show you where the kid friendly trails are at.","March 26, 2018",Breathtaking views - Stayed for 2 Days,19,"Cotati, California, United States",5

We explored many of the side roads and it’s and it’s fabulous! A lot of the trails are fairly short but we couldn’t do most of them because we had our dogs - no pets on the trails. We were able to go to see the panoramic view (it was cool and we could leave “the boys” in the truck for a short time and in sight). When we first saw it around noon, the lighting was perfect and it’s one of the most awesome (a word I seldom use) sights I’ve ever seen. Breathtaking!

Capitol Reef National Park,"I spent one week in and around Capitol Reef National park. My basecamp was in Torrey Utah at the 1000 Lakes RV Park. I stayed in one of their camping cabins ($40 per night), which includes access to bathroom and shower facilities. There are many things to do in the park such as scenic drives, hiking and photography. I hiked the Grand Wash and portions of the Capitol Gorge. If you have off roading skills and a capable vehicle you will enjoy, as I did, the Cathedral Valley loop the has majestic red rock towers and vistas. I also drove the entire Burr Trail Road from Notom Road to Highway 12. This road takes you across Capitol Reef, then through Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument. Again a very scenic drive. The town of Torrey has excellent access to gas and food options. If your not into camping there are many lodging choices there also.","February 21, 2018",Exploring Remote Utah,20,,5

The views keep coming up on you & there are numerous pull outs where you can get out of your car and just soak in the amazing natural beauty. The Fruita School house, the petroglyphs, and several other sites are really worth stopping for. Photographic opportunities abound. I am not sure Capitol Reef gets the attention it deserves being so close to some of its more famous brother parks (Zion, Bryce & Arches) not to mention all of the National Monument sites scattered in the region as well. This is certainly an area of UTAH worth many days of visiting, and Capitol Reef is really a park not to miss.","January 3, 2018",Another fantastic National Park of unique & wonderful natural beauty,205,"Littleton, New Hampshire",5

Was a great drive through hwy 12 and now we understand what ""free range"" means as we saw them herding about 50 cows down from the mountains. We stopped in at the Wayne County Travel Council Info Ctr and talked to them for a while about the area.From here, we proceeded to get on 24 and head towards the park. Be sure to check out the visitor center here where you can get maps, use the restroom and pay to enter the park (annual NP pass will get you in here).

Good advice here is to leave the primary highways (interstate etc), with a full tank of gas. There is gas available in Torrey but sketchy at best along the way.

The Fremont river winds its way beneath the Waterpocket Fold; a 100 mile buckle in the earth's crust. This fold provides dramatic red cliffs and extraordinary scenic hikes. If you're lucky to have a clear night sky the star gazing is also incredible. Much of the park can be viewed from the car with easy stops for capturing the scenery.

The visitor center is a nice modern structure full of useful information. There is a scenic drive that we did not take but plenty to do elsewhere in the park too. The orchards are beautiful to walk through and the historic settlement sites and petroglyphs offer a very diverse view into the history of the area. If you plan your trip right, you can even pick your own fruit to take home. Don’t miss the pies in the Gifford House, they are amazing!

It extends north-south from Thousand Lake Mountain to Lake Powell of Colorado River, the result of over 60 million years of nature forces uplifting and sculpting the earth crust.

You can complete the scenic drive, and stop to see petroglyphs, historic buildings and the orchards. When we arrived a large thunderstorm was coming and so most of the trails had flash flood watches. Because of this we didn't hike at all - this was a bummer but it was still great to be able to see some of the sights close to the roads in the park.

The hike is 2.2 miles one way with only 200 feet of elevation. This hike definitely qualifies as ""Easy"". The hike is through a canyon with a specular section about halfway, where the canyon narrows with very high vertical walls on both sides. Almost as impressive as a slot canyon hike. Access is off the ""Scenic Drive"" with 1.3 miles to the trail head on a dirt road. 2-wheel drive vehicles with low ground clearance will be able to access the trail head parking lot without any problem.Gifford House is also a popular stop for most visitors. There is a very small museum, but the Gifford House is mostly visited to purchase one or more of their individual size pies or cinnamon rolls. Get there before 10:00 AM if you want a Cinnamon Roll. We stopped at 1:30 PM and some of their pies varieties were already gone. I will personally confirm that their pies are indeed ""The Best""! Some of the pie options are Peach, Apple, Cherry, Mixed Berry, Strawberry Rhubarb & Pumpkin. They also have 3 small rooms with items for sale.Another unique feature at this park are the orchards which date back more than 100 years when this area was first settled. You are allowed to pick & eat the fruit onsite or pick fruit to take back which you pay for. In October apples were available. Other fruit options are available earlier in the year. No pesticides are used.Petroglyphs can also be seen along a boardwalk by Hwy 24. There is a parking lot pulloff which is less than a mile from the visitor center.

It reminded me of the Indiana Jones ride at Disneyland, especially the last two miles which is on a dirt road. With lots of curves in the road and bumpy terrain it was quite an adventure! We opened our sunroof and enjoyed the beauty of the tall rock formations which were especially beautiful in the reddish glow from the sinking sun. Very beautiful & picture-worthy!

Capitol Reef National Park,This day Oct 4th was my 55th birthday and Capitol Reef Nat'l Park a first time visit for us. We spent the day driving the scenic tar road and then took both the Grand Wash dirt road and the Capitol Gorge dirt road.. Both were outstanding drives and picturesque photographers dream. The only trail we took was the Capitol Gorge Trailhead and the Tanks straight-up trail to the upper back country.. We probably could have taken the Gorge trailhead for miles farther and ended up who knows where.. It was a great trail.. We loved it.,"October 8, 2017",55th birthday hiking Utah Nat'l Pks,3,,5
Capitol Reef National Park,"The most popular parks are Bryce, Zion and Arches etc, and so this seems to be less well know. It is superb. If you are just driving, then you can see much from the comfort of your car by just taking the Scenic Drive. A day would suffice. If you are more energetic, there at least two days' worth of trails. I managed Cassidy Arch, Golden Thone, Hickman Bridge, Rim Overlook and Capitol Gorge plus tanks. The Golden Throne was a long walk without a great view at the end. It just stopped. The others are well worth the effort","October 7, 2017",A gem,82,"London, United Kingdom",5

The landscape is unique, hikes are beautiful, pies are yummy, and the orchards are fun. We had bad weather for 1 of our 2 days but managed to hike Hickman Bridge, Cohab Canyon to part of Frying Pan.

Capitol Reef National Park,"This is one of Utah's big five national parks and like the others, is great. It is relatively small compared to other parks, and entry is only $10 which we paid at an honesty box on the way in (there is a Visitor Centre with rest rooms and information so you can get orientated). There are some nice hikes in this park - Cassidy Arch and Hinkman Bridge are particularly good, and we also walked to Goosenecks and Sunset point which are less challenging. At the far end of the park, you can venture 2.5 miles down an unmade road (recommend SUV) through a high sided canyon to reach the Capitol Gorge trail. There is also an Orchard where you can go pick fruit.

Quite a bit of history here too with old apple orchards where you can still pick fresh apples for $2/lb.The walks are many and varied. And this is a v good time of year to do them. We did the Cassidy Arch, which takes less than an hour and takes you to a natural arch.

We had wonderful hikes ranging from easy strolls to challenging. The visitor center is excellent offering lots of suggestions including interesting ranger talks that really make clear the geology of the area. Capitol Reef is a treasure. It was extremely hot when we were there (close to 100 degrees), so recommend early morning and late afternoon hiking if you're not used to the altitude and heat. There are no food, water or fuel services in the park, so fill up before and bring plenty of sustenance (coolers with ice recommended).

We did the scenic drive on Day 1 after a 2.5 hour drive here. It was incredible and gives you a good feel for what there is to see. On Day 2 we did a fairly long drive and hiked the Headquarters Canyon hike - a slot canyon hike that was very, very worth the drive. On Day 3 we did Gooseneck, Hickman Bridge and the Petroglyphs.

Although some un- paved roads, they were all in great shape unlike Monument Valley! The unpaved takes you back into narrow canyon roads where you can get up close and really see the Canyon walls. The hike to Butch Cassidy's , supposed, hideout was well worth the hike to really experience the aura of the canyons.Stayed at Broken Spur hotel in Torrey--old but well maintained.

Schedule at least a 1/2 a day for the drive to be able and get out of your car to enjoy at least a short hike.Make sure you bring plenty of water and food, especially snacks as there is no food for sale except for some fresh fruit pies at the Gifford House and that is if they are not sold out for the day!!","September 20, 2017",Well worth visit!!,363,"San Francisco, California",5

A completely different experience, with enormous rock formations of all colors, just spectacular. We took route 12 from Bryce, which should have been a 90 minute drive but took us over 2 1/2 hours because of the outstanding scenery. Just before you get to the park itself on HWY 24, look for the gooseneck overlook lay-by. It's a 1/2 mile drive in to the 600 foot hike, but will give you an experience you will not soon forget. In the park, I recommend the riverside hike which is only a couple of miles, in and back but the last 1/2 mile has a 480 foot elevation change and it ain't down.

Capitol Reef National Park,"We had no idea when we turned off I-70 onto Hwy 24 scenic route that we'd end up in Capitol Reef National Park. We didn't know it existed until Wednesday. The highway crosses almost a hundred miles of Waterpocket Fold, which was once a formidable barrier to east-west travel. Prospectors searching for gold called an impassable barrier a reef. And the peaks of many mountain tops here look like rounded domes of state capitol buildings. Thus the name of the park - Capitol Reef. The sandstone peaks and canyons are just stunning. And the geology seems to change dramatically every few miles. We actually saw teal green rock ridges running through some of the peaks, as well as red-orange and creamy white. We stopped to read the history of early Mormon settlers and saw original homesteads, as well as the first school built here in 1896.Hiking trails with varying levels of difficulty abound throughout the park. Several clean restroom stops are available on Hwy 24, and there's a picnic area at the visitor center. We were pleased to encounter few tourists just after Labor Day. This is an excellent time to visit, because you're not elbow to elbow with other explorers.

The panoramic views, the canyonlands and the huge rock formations are awe inspiring and you can drive much of the park! We watched the solar eclipse on top of The Chimney Rock Trail and had 360 degree views of the eclipse and were the only 2 at the top of the peak & on the trail! We also hiked the Cassidy Arch Trail and had an awesome time doing so. It was very hot, because we didn't start this trail until 1:30pm. Be sure that you have plenty of water with you and watch for the cairns near the end of the trail as you scramble over large boulders. The arch and the hole in the top of the rock was amazing to see & we got great photos! We only saw one other couple on the trail. We were so happy to buy a homemade strawberry rhubarb pie near the orchards once we finished the trail! The next day we did the Petroglyph and Tanks Trail and this was another great trail. You do have to watch for the cairns pretty closely to get to the tanks (large watering holes in the rocks), but it is well worth it.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Among the ""easy"" trails at Capitol reef is Capitol Gorge. It's a two miler (round trip) with an elevation change of 80feet. You will walk thru a deep canyon with historic inscriptions in the rock along the way. At the end there is a steep climb to some water pockets also called ""tanks."" We never made it there. What is easy for some is harder for others. Unfortunately we were attempting this in the high heat of the day. We had lots of water but even still it is easy to get baked. Wear a hat or even better use an umbrella to fight off the strength of the unrelenting sun. If you go in the early morning it is probably a lot easier. I spotted two golden eagles and their nest in a rock crevice. There were some flowering plants along the way as well. We never reached the tanks, we saw others try to reach them as well. It was an adventure, but I was glad to get back to the car and some A/C. I would love to come back in the fall. I think it would be more fun. Be sure to get a trail guide upon entering the park and carefully review the trail options, distances, elevation changes, difficulty levels and descriptions. Always carry ample water: 32oz per person and each child. Beware of lightning risk, falling rock and flash floods. Because of animal wildlife do not allow kids to run ahead alone or to lag behind the group. Stay together as a group. Lastly, please wear real shoes!

It was just a bit out of the way and we were excited about so many other parks (Arches, Bryce, Yellowstone) that this one became overlooked. However, at the last moment, we decided to take route 24 to Moab from Hatch, which led us through the park--what an outstanding mistake. This park, like most national parks, was beautiful in all places, awesome in several, and breathtaking in a few. The formations in the park (Chimeny Rock and Hickman Bridge, as examples) were great. The hiking was strenuous at times but accesible for even beginners. The petroglyphs were a cool piece that was unique to parks we have seen so far.Highly recommend stopping!

It is small and there are a couple of drives, with various pullouts, you can take but if you are not into strenuous hiking as there are only a few items that can be seen as an easy walk/hike.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Got out of Torrey after replenishing the CRV, reaching CR after a 5 mile drive. Stopped, per custom, at the visitors center to get the lay of the land and pick up the NPS brochures. Once again, this park made me wish I had paid closer attention in Geology class! The formations here are wondrous to behold. The geologic story is fascinating.We did more tramping around here than in any previous park. We managed to get really up close and personal with Capitol Reef in several areas. I will recount our favorite experience; our walk through Grand Wash (GW). We started at the Southwest Trailhead off Scenic Drive. A parking area lies about 300 yards off the road to better access the GW hiking trail. Reaching this place requires a nimble vehicle. The road and parking lot could be well described as ""unimproved."" When we arrived (9:15 AM or so) the lot was already at least 2/3's full. When we came back from our hike around 1 PM or so (we took our time) the lot was full. I recall our total distance covered on this hike to be around 4 miles.We hiked down to the ""Narrows"" and then back. We were not alone but the hike had its solitary moments. We saw several groups of hikers on trails at the top of GW well above us. We benefited from the shade provided by the high walls on our way down to the ""Narrows"" but found fewer shady spots on our return. I think it might have something to do with the rotation of the earth. Wear a broad brimmed hat and carry water and you should be fine. Make sure you know the weather forecast as this is the last place you want to be when it rains! This is a nice easy hike throughout. Heck, if we can do this anybody can! Fruita Historic District also worth an extended visit. Check out the Petroglyphs nearby!

Capitol Reef National Park,"This is a beautiful park, but will be somewhat limited for some people. There is a nice scenic drive, but if you or your car cannot handle a gravel road, you will miss the best parts. I had a Jeep, so I had no problem going to the Cassidy Wash and Capitol Gorge. My parents were in a Hyundai, though, and my mom insisted on turning around at the beginning of the road. Most cars will actually have no problem on either road, unless you have a big RV or a sports car. Both drives are through a narrow canyon, and I would recommend taking the top off if you have a convertible. It was too hot and we had limited time, so we didn't do any long hikes, but we did hike to the Pioneer Register, which was pretty nice. If we had more time, I would have done a lot more hiking, and it looks like there is some good off-roading throughout the park.","July 30, 2017",Better if you have a 4x4,32,"Los Angeles, California",4

We had a beautiful picnic lunch in The beautiful green area of Fruits along the Fremont river. Nice picnic are. Definitely get one of the fruit pies at the Gifford house. Delicious! The Waterpocket fold is a beautiful rock formation. We drove the scenic drive. Both Washes were closed secondary to flash floods which are common in the summer. We hiked Hickman Bridge which was a very nice hike--some hills. We also did the 3.6 mile Chimney Rick hike--strenuous but beautiful views of Fruita and the gold. Not as popular as say Zion or Arches, but definitely glad we stopped. Not much in the town of Torrey. Certain could do in less than a day. Best part of our visit here was the night program!! Very little light here so an excellent place to view the night sky and the Milky Way. Ranger Lauren gave a very nice presentation on fossils just before the astronomy program.

Ironically that beauty is magnified by the fact that few people are around. The hikes are amazing....and of every level.....but you have to do the Cohab Canyon, Frying Pan, Great Wash loop. This trail will give you 800 feet of climb and some of the most amazing views in Utah. Just don't do it in July! We almost melted....but we made it.

When we got into the park around noon, the trailhead to the Hickman Bridge was packed, so we decided just to move on and stop at the picnic area. The picnic area was nice and had plenty of tables spread out, with some under the shade of trees. We had a nice lunch while we watched people play frisbee and toss baseballs. After lunch we drove back to the apricot orchard where you can pick your own fruit. The kids enjoyed picking the fruit, but quickly found out that they do not like apricots. We were going to try and hike, but by that time it was extremely hot, so we decided to keep moving on to Bryce.

Make sure you visit the Gifford House for a sticky bun---also the Scenic Road that leads into the southern part of the park is worth the ride. Go to the Visitor Center for the short movie to get insight into the park. Check out the one room schoolhouse and search for the petroglyphs on the rock wall panels---Take your time to spot them.

Temperatures were a little cooler, crowds were smaller since school was still in session, and days were getting longer. The valley is beautiful and there are places along the highway to stop and walk or even hike. Grand Wash is my favorite and we always go at least part way into it. This year we started our walk from the scenic drive entrance instead of highway 24. If you take the entire hike, you will need someone to pick you up at the other end or just turn around and hike in the other direction. The scenic drive ends at Capitol Gorge where you can hike or take a backcountry drive through the high cliffs.

There are some dirt roads that are drivable by most vehicles and that are well maintained. The Visitor's Center is small, but the rangers are informative and friendly.

There is nowhere for lunch or dinner in the park, so plan accordingly. We stopped at a gas station with a Subway before entering the park to get lunch to pack in our cooler. We drove through the park on 24 and also drove the side roads off of 24. We hiked the Capitol Gorge trail. It's hot with little shade. Be sure to wear a hat & sunscreen.

The first day we did Capitol Wash and Hickman's Bridge (we thought we made it to the end with some bridge type formations, but found out later we had a little further to go). It was a little steamy that day, so we limited our hiking with an 11, 10 and 71 year old in the group. Fantastic stuff though. Day two we started at the Capitol Gorge Trail. Beautiful hike through a canyon with petroglyphs and old explorers names carved high up from the 18 and 1900s. At the end their was a tough hike (almost straight up) to see the nature water pots. My son went with my wife and I (daughter and mother-in-law stayed at the bottom. Some fun rock climbing and jumping, but definitely not too bad if not scared of heights. Worth the hike up. We also did the Freemont Petroglyph. Easy hike on decking. Saw some decent petroglyphs.

There's not much traffic or trails, but the scenic drives (preferably at midday to maximize lighting for pictures) are very beautiful. Don't go to Pleasant Creek though.

They have the most delicious locally made little pies, perfect for 1-2, and you can sit outside and enjoy them. A perfect start to your exploration of the park. There are also nice picnic tables nearby under shade trees. From there you can explore the park's interior via the scenic drive. Don't be afraid to drive beyond the paved portion. At the end there is a parking lot which leads to a 1 mile hike through the Narrows. You'll see all sorts of neat petroglyphs on the walls. The final part of the hike is a steep climb up to see ponds, but when we were there there was no water in the ponds so best to check first at the visit center before you waste energy climbing up and are disappointed.","June 27, 2017",Worth a visit!!,85,"Wellesley, Massachusetts",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"If you are rating a national park based on the mileage of scenic drive and numbers of scenic spots, you are probably going go be disappointed by Capitol Reef National Park. This place is definitely NOT as popular as Arches, Bryce, Zion or Rocky Mountain. But if you can take a step back, re-evaluating the geological wonderland from a distance (a good way to do it is driving on Hwy 24 from Torrey to the park), you will appreciate how magnificent and significant the landscape is. An even better way to explore the park is to take a hike on many of the trails it offers. The HIckman Bridge Trail is the most popular one and easily accessible, but if you have enough time, try the Rim Overlook trail that will give you a rewarding panoramic view at the end of the hike. The visitor center is great as well. Before I visited this park, I found lots of jargon in the description and introduction of the park that are hardly comprehensible: waterpocket fold, monocline...etc. The rangers in the visitor centers are very friendly and knowledgeable, and they answered all my geological questions.

Collectively, these are an outstanding collection of protected areas, each offering something different and unique to explore and visit.Capital Reef National Park is the middle national park and is situated around the geological land formation referred to as the Waterpocket Fold, a ripple in the Earth's crust which runs around 90 miles north and south, right down the middle of Capital Reef.The Park is smaller than its fellows in terms of areas to explore. We spent 2 days exploring and hiking in the area around Highway 24 & the Scenic Drive. There are some nice hikes throughout, ranging from 1-4 hours in length and a range of difficulty. You can learn about available hikes and more about the Waterpocket Fold formation on the NPS Capital Reef website or at the visitor centre at the Hwy 24 and Scenic Drive junction. There is a interesting area called Fruita Valley worth spending a bit of time as well. This area that was inhabited by settlers at the turn of the 20th century. There are several historic buildings, including the Gifford Homestead which serves as a bakery and giftshop. You can see petroglyphs in the area as well.There is an expected campgrounds in Capital Reef National Park. Otherwise, most visitors will stay in Torrey, 15 minute drive west of the park. There is a range of hotels, restaurants and convenient shops at this small town as well. Based on our experience, it seems possible to see most highlight spots during 1 full day within Capital Reef National Park.

Continue on to Friuta. Here you are allowed to pick and eat fruit for free, in season. If you pick to remove from the park there is a charge. Just past Fruita is a small picnic area, wonderful for a picnic and clean rest rooms. Just past this is a Mormon house run by the local historical society. Here you can buy coffee and fresh fruit pies or cinnamon rolls. It is a very scenic area, well,worth the time.","June 7, 2017",Outstanding hits and hidden gems,221,"Shelby, Michigan",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"We spent 7 hours. We started at the Visitor Center and watched the short film. Then we hiked the Hickman Trail and stopped to see petroglyphs. Next we went through the Fruita District and stopped at the Gifford House to split a peach pie. Delicious. Next on to the Grand Wash Trail, followed by Capitol Gorge Trail. As we left the park we finished with the Sunset Trail. The park was not crowded, which was really nice. It is such a beautiful park, my favorite so far. We have been to Zion and Bryce, too.

Capitol Reef National Park,"This is a lovely scenic park with very high cliffs and lovely rock formations.We stayed just down the road at Austins Chuck Waggon as it was only 10 miles from there to the park entrance. There is a 10 mile scenic drive once there that you can do, we chose this route as we were heading out to Hanksville on our continuing road trip to Moab the following day.There is a $10 fee that you pay on the way through the scenic drive. This is not a manned gate and you put your envelope with money in a box at an outpost and removed your park pass. It seemed a lot of people were not stopping and dodging payment, which was really sad to see. There are quite a few pull-outs along the way for viewing and taking pictures. Our only issue was there were quite a few gnats that came on us as we got out of the car to take pictures. It looked like there had been rain so we are not sure if this was the reason why. We wouldn't have liked walking any great distance due to this.Our favourite look out was Goosenecks overlook which was fantastic.

Capitol Reef National Park,"We found this National Park to be less spectacular than the other Utah National Parks but had its very own charm. The ten mile scenic drive is worth the time it takes to drive the narrow road both directions. There is limited camping in the park so camp outside the park boundaries in the nearby National Forest. There are fruit orchards so try and time your visit to when the fruit is ripe as it is literally ""ripe for the taking"" while remaining in the orchard to eat the fruit. The visitor center is smallish but serviceable.","June 3, 2017",Ten mile scenic drive worth the time,16,Somewhere Usa,4

Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef NP is a massive geological upliftment called the Waterpocket Fold. The incredible north-south length (400 miles) of this feature proved to be impenetrable for many, many years. Over time, a river cut a narrow course through this ""rock wall"", and that provided the way for man to first travel through this barrier...using the stream bed as the roadway. The small valley at Fruita was settled and became a bustling crossroads for the fruits and vegetables the naturally irrigated fields produced. The historical settlement of Fruita has been carefully preserved and is quite interesting to do a walking tour.The geology within Capitol Reef is one-of-a-kind. The Scenic Drive is sufficient to view the majestic beauty of the table mesa formations, buttes, and knife canyons. Getting out of the car and doing some offroad hiking is also quite inspirational as well. Hiking along the Capitol Gorge trail is recommended if you have the time...plan about 1-2 hours to do it justice. So if your travels are taking you from Bryce Canyon NP and to Arches NP...then you pretty much have to drive right through Capitol Reef NP...then take the time to visit.

Capitol Reef National Park,"If all you do is drive through the park on hwy 24, you are really missing the park. The park is only about 8 miles wide (east-to-west) but is about 100 miles long (north-to-south). We drove both of the loop drives that were recommended by the folks at the visitor center. The northern loop requires a high-clearance vehicle and takes you to Cathedral Valley. It's about a 60 mile loop drive and starts with fording the Fremont River. It just gets better after that. We didn't use 4WD, but parts of the trail are very rough and rocky. Not driveable if wet!On our second day, we drove the southern loop, down to the Burr Trail which takes you west to hwy 12 which you can take to get back North to hwy 24. This was another visual extravaganza, and the Burr Trail switchbacks were great fun. This drive can be done in a car, but the dirt ""road"" portion can be bumpy & washboardy. However, there's not much dirt road in this 120+ mile loop--maybe 20 miles or so.The best part of both of these drives is that once we got off hwy 24, we saw only a few other vehicles each day. Really, less than 6 vehicles on each loop. We felt like we had the park all to ourselves--wonderful! While the drive on hwy 24 is quite nice, you MUST take the other drives through the park to really appreciate the beauty.","May 31, 2017","A fantastic NP, spectacular views & outstanding drives!",142,"Whitewater, Colorado",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"Stopped at this park as part of the tour of parks in this areaWe happened to be there on a day when a ranger was leading a hike. We had the opportunity to see beautiful petroglyphs. Had never seen them before and I was amazed This park is different from many of the National Parks in the area, in that you are in the canyon looking up. Many of the other parks you are on the rim looking down.It was May, but parts of the day were chilly, we wore jackets. No lodge in this park. I see other reviewers did not enjoy the home made pies, but we sat in the sun and enjoyed the sweet treats.

Capitol Reef National Park,"This was the third of the 5 Utah national parks that we visited during a two week trip. Reviews for other parks will be posted. First, to set context; the parks are different and it's hard to compare. It also depends why you are going to the parks. We went to do day hiking (easy to moderate) and photography so this review is based on that. If you are there to just get on and off the shuttle and snap a couple of pictures or to do major hiking, check other reviews.We thought that this was a really interesting park and enjoyed the hikes but like canyon lands, it's probably one of the least developed. That does not take away from it's beauty and variation. You can walk on mountains or in gorges and all are beautiful. There are a lot of options for different types of hiking and beautiful photos. Don't pass it up just because it's not as known.If you don't want to hike, the park has a scenic drive which anyone can do and get out to snap photos at different viewpoints. The rangers were REALLY helpful here and provided great options for hikes and photo opportunities including sunset and astrophotography. This is a dark sky park so staying up late and seeing the stars is highly recommended. The Panorama viewpoint is a great option for this. There are not as many water filling stations here so check about where you can fill up before your hike but like the rest of the state, you need to stay hydrated.We were there for three nights and had two days of hiking. The first day was going on the Cohab trail from the Hickman bridge end which we then took into the frying pan trail instead of going to the campground. We went most of the way on frying pan but did not go all the way to Cassidy Arch because of possible threatening weather which never materialized. While Frying Pan is listed as a moderate or difficult, we thought it was fine for the portion we did. There were great views throughout both trails and good elevation change. There are also amazing patterns in the rock formations. Like most of our hikes, we started about 830 am and only saw a few people.The afternoon hike was Capitol gorge which was a totally different feel. This hike, except for the optional trip up to the potholes, is pretty easy. Once you drive the dirt road to get to the trailhead. I had a small SUV which was fine but I also saw people with sedans not having a problem. This walk is just what it sounds like. You walk in a gorge with huge walls on the sides. You can go for as long as you want. There are some pictographs to see and some inscribing from early settlers. Unfortunately, there is also some graffiti from idiots who traveled through on hikes. If you decide to go up to the potholes, be ready to do a little more aggressive hiking up, sometimes on narrow paths and over some large rocks. It's cool to see them though. Since this hike was in afternoon, we did see more people but still not bad.Second day morning hike was Hickman bridge. This is one of the most popular hikes in the park so we got there early to get parking. The hike is good and had some nice views not the real reason to go is to see the bridge which is 133 feet across. While you will see a ton of arches if you go to Arches park, this is still a really nice hike to do in Capitol Reef. It has some good elevation change throughout.The afternoon on the second day was the Fremont River hike which follows the river for a while and then starts ascending. It does get rather steep and it a somewhat narrow path with a sheer drop at times on one side. You can go to two different viewpoints with panoramic views. I went to the first and then turned around. A beautiful hike as long as you are OK in walking with those conditions. One of us was, one was not and turned around quickly after it started ascending.","May 28, 2017",Not as well known but beautiful park that you should visit,17,"Morris County, New Jersey",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"We visited in May when it was unseasonably cold and windy. But we didn't mind, as we kept cool during our hikes and enjoyed our campfires (outside the park). There is no shuttle in this park. The first hike we did was Hickman Bridge which is 0.9 miles and rated moderate. It was a nice easy hike whose trailhead is right off the paved road. Coming to Hickman Bridge, which was larger than I expected was a nice surprise. The walk back to the trailhead is downhill and offers great views of Capitol Dome on the other side of the road.The next hike we did was the Golden Throne hike. This requires a long drive on a dirt road in a canyon. The varying rock formations on this drive made it very interesting. The trail is 2 miles and is rated strenuous. It may have been just slightly more strenuous than Hickman Bridge, but at double the distance, I can see why it is rated strenuous. The great thing about this hike is that as you climb, the views of the area improve. When you reach the end of the trail, you are at an overlook that offers expansive views of the southern part of the park. The Golden Throne rises to the north and is quite impressive, although you are not quite at the ""foot"" of it as some hike descriptions claim.The final hike we did was to sunset point to watch the sun set. Although conditions were overcast, there was an opening in the clouds above the horizon. So we were able to watch the sunset.The visitors center and its gift shop are small, but adequate. The rangers were very helpful. If you are in southern Utah, you should visit this park.","May 27, 2017",Great National Park!,8,,5
Capitol Reef National Park,"If there wasn't a sign, you wouldn't know this was a National Park. There's no Park entrance or payment. There was a restaurant nearby that said it was in the middle of nowhere and that's the way they like it. That sums up a visit to this Park - its great if it's nowhere you want. If you are in the area, or have to do The Big 5 like us, plan on a ""drive-through"". If you make this a destination and have high expectations, you will be disappointed. Lots of pretty rock formations, a couple of historic areas and that's that. Didn't do the scenic drive because we it was boring. Try going later in the day - shadows don't make good photos. The famous ""small"" homemade apple pies at the farmhouse/museum were $6 and I swear they were delivered from a bakery in Torrey UT down the road.

Capitol Reef National Park,"My wife and I went to this park not expecting much and we were not disappointed. She went to the park ranger info desk to ask what was a highlight of this park, since we had allocated about three hours here, and we were told to drive down a narrow park road through a canyon, then a dirt road for about 8 miles, then go see a petrograph and some ""pioneer graffitti"". The drive through the canyon was nice, but there were no places to pull over and take photos. It would have been very easy for the park to build these, but they just didn't do it. We followed the park map closely and found the petrograph within a few minutes, with a small post set in the ground so you couldn't miss a single sun drawn on the sandstone wall. Very underwhelming. The pioneer graffitti was supposed to be only about a half mile farther down the trail. We walked for more than a mile and half and couldn't see anything that remotely resembled graffitti. We talked with about 30 other hikers who were trying to find the same thing. None of them saw it either. Then on the way back, we accidently found the graffitti. Most of it looked like it was done in the 21st century. Why the park could not put a sign or post indicating where these wall markings were, I'll never know. But I do know that this was absolutely not worth the time at all. This park could really be something if they had someone in charge who could show just a little bit of common sense that is common at just about any other national or state park.","May 21, 2017",This National Park Needs some Serious Attention to Detail,7,,3

Capitol Reef National Park,"We really didn't expect much from Capital Reef - in fact it wasn't even on our to do list! We were really just passing through but Wow! Secret treasure of a park –we think better than Zion not only in terms of scenery, but not as crowded! The Scenic Drive is fantastic…. Drive beyond the historic buildings and campgrounds…. Turn off the drive to the Grand Wash – Walk the river bottom through towering canyon cliffs. The entrance to the Cassidy Arch trail is a little hard to find, in fact one couple we met who intended to climb it walked past it, both ways! Though experienced hikers, we discovered later they turned back as the going was more difficult than they expected and the trail hard to follow. Be aware the temperatures in these canyons can be 40 degrees hotter than the parking lot so dress in layers and take water.There are plenty of turn outs along the 10 mile long scenic drive to stop and take pictures.At the end of paved road is a picnic area/ vault toilets, but you can continue on a gravel narrow and bumpy road for another 2 1/5 miles – go slowly as there isn’t much room to pull over should you meet another vehicle. At the end, there is the beginning of the Capital Gorge trail which again follows the wash but through even more impressive canyon walls which are covered with some pictoglyphs, Sadly a lot of other travellers have carved their names into the rock – But some of those names actually are pioneers who recorded their presence going back to the early 1900’s. You will also see some metal poles stuck in the rock – left over from the original telephone wire connection. Note, you should not do any walking in the Washes if there is a chance of rain because of the risk of flash floods.Back on Hwy 24 head 1 mile east and stop at the large pictograph wall There are two boardwalks which will take you to the engravings. The first boardwalk has an audio recording to explain some of it. The second boardwalk is perhaps 300 yds long and takes you along the bottom of the rock face.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Looking for an adventure, I packed my young school age trip and we headed down to Capital Reef National Park. It was perfect for a day trip, and accomplished my kids mission which was to seen an arch.The rangers were friendly and knowledgeable. They pointed out the Hickman Bridge. According to the ranger, it's their most popular trail. The parking lot gets full and it's not very big. There's parking on the highway, but there are blind corners. So be careful. The high to the arch is up hill most of the way and has fine sand. Little shade, so bring a hat and lots of water. It can feel longer than what it is. My younger school age kids did ok with breaks, but it wore us all out by the end. They had fun though as there are lots of lizards, and rocks to climb through, up, and around.The petroglyphs were a blast and the boardwalk to see them were lined with caterpillars. The caterpillars had even made cocoons. The scenic drive has stellar views. I chose not to go through to the wash and other arch as the road to both is very rocky and bumpy.When driving through highway 24, the amenities are sparse and far apart.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Gas, groceries, etc. are available in Torry, UT 11 miles to the west on Hwy. 24 and in Hanksville, UT 37 mi. to the east. There is another little town to the east, Caineville, but there is nothing there except a motel. These businesses are closed on Sunday.This park has such a variety of things to see. I was stunned by the difference in the landscape driving west from Moab to the east. Between Caineville and Capitol Reef NP, the land is a barren desert that looks like a moonscape. There are mountains of gray sand/dirt that look so uninviting. Then, you reach the Fremont River w/a lush valley that was once a Mormon settlement called Fruita or Fruitvale. Here, you find a large picnic spot beside the river w/a number of tables spread out among the trees. It has restrooms, signs explaining the history of the ""mail tree"", a large grassy area for the kids to run around, and ample parking. There are a number of buildings left over from the Mormon settlement that are open for you to tour, orchards of heirloom fruit that you may pick and eat the many varieties of fruit during harvest time. Signs indicate when the orchard is open for picking. This oasis in the park (Fruita) also has a campground w/64 sites right by the river that fills up quickly. Some are wheelchair accessible.Another big attraction of Capitol Reef is the easily accessible petroglyph viewing. There is a boardwalk viewing area along Hwy 24 on the east side of the visitor's center with ample parking. The petroglyphs are visible w/the naked eye, but 4 mounted binoculars are provided. There is also a recorded message describing the history of the petroglyphs. I also used my binoculars for viewing further along the boardwalk where there were no mounted binoculars. A scenic drive of 9 miles of paved road and 2 additional mi. of dirt road begins just past the picnic grounds. There is a $10.00 fee. The visitor's center personnel told me that the drive takes 3 hours, and I was shocked. How can 9 mi. take 3 hours? But the road is winding, and the speed limit is 10 mph is a number of places. You also drive though several washes that are big dips in the road. Flash flooding is a possibility and the road is closed when weather dictates. Do not stop on the road for photos. There are a number of different pullouts and viewpoints along the route. The scenery is some of the best around, rivaling Zion NP and Arches. However, it is not nearly as crowded as the more popular parks, which is a bonus. There are 4 ""easy"" trails, ranging from .1 mi to 2.2 mi., 3 ""moderate"" trails, and 8 ""strenuous trails. The trail guide warns of rockfall, lightning, flash floods, and steep drop-offs. Bring plenty of water, hiking shoes/boots, a hat, sunscreen, and hiking poles.","April 19, 2017",Stunning scenery w/o the crowds,596,"Austin, Texas",4

Capitol Reef National Park,"In just about any other state, Capital Reef would be a primary point of interest and beauty. But here in Utah, sandwiched between Arches and Bryce, it is certainly less known. It is beautiful in its own right, but less unique than its sister parks - which does make it much less crowded! Definitely worth the drive through and doing a few hikes if time allows. We spent about 2-3 hours hiking and exploring and that was about right for us. If you do the hike to the tanks: Don't miss the names carved in the rock on the right hand side way up high - it is not marked. Also, when you get to the tanks, go back the way you came about 20 yards but hug closer to the crevice than the trail does and you will see 2 land bridges caused by rushing water. We liked this area better than the tanks themselves.","April 16, 2017","Spend time with Nature, not with crowds",91,"Dallas, Texas",5

This seems to be a less crowded park, most likely due to being a bit out of the way, but it was definitely worth the drive! You can go from desert landscape to evergreen forest in one drive and there are hoodoos, petroglyphs, arches, a natural bridge, canyons, beautiful vistas and scenery - something for everyone! We did several hikes - the Capital Gorge trail, The Tanks, The Goosenecks Point & Sunset Point w/ children ages 10yrs to 3yrs.

The best advice we got was to make Capitol Reef our longest stay, as it would be cooler than other locations. That was great advice. We enjoyed fantastic hiking (ask the ranger to tell you about Sulphur Creek. It isn't listed as a hike probably because it can be dangerous if there have been rains, but if the weather has been dry, it is a wonderful hike with some water holes for cooling off).  If you want a less-rigorous day, you can also access the Scenic Hwy 12 Bypass easily from here for additional spectacular views, short hikes including a slot canyon off the beaten path near Boulder, Utah. Also, the campground is great for families with younger children. It has a separate child-friendly interpretative center, fruit orchard, some splashing and wading opportunities in the creek, and FANTASTIC night stars.","March 31, 2017",July Tent Camping in Utah,4,"Saint Paul, Minnesota",5

This was OK because we as a family needed to get disconnected. If you're touring southern Utah in the national parks this must be one of your destinations to see.

There were, of course, people out and about, but it was manageable.

The views of the canyons are terrific! So are the hikes, but if you are like us trying to see one park a day, these ""car hikes"" will get you the views in shorter time.

We got tiny fruit pies and hand churned ice cream, a unique experience. Had a most challenging and sonic hike. Capitol Reef was far less crowded than any of the other parks we visited in southern Utah, which felt luxurious. We had out hiking trail to ourselves. Sat in the beauty and ate our trail mix and just enjoyed. I found it especially delightful that there was preservation from past civilizations. The ranger at the welcome center listened to my 6 year old complain about not being able to take rocks from the park (which he did at every park we visited...complained not take rocks) this ranger however didn't give the canned ""if you take a rock then it won't be there for everyone else"", or the ""what if everyone took a rock"" he gave us directions to a great place outside of the park to collect geodes.

The crowds up in Arches were a bit of a turnoff for such a scenic state but the trip to Capitol Reef was the highlight of our vacation. We stayed in Torrey in our RV and ventured out in the Jeep to explore. We chose Cathedral Valley because we figured the recommended high vehicle clearance would limit the cars to 4WD's.

There are some gorgeous hikes here where you can find yourself quite alone in the beautiful surroundings. You can enter this park from Highway 12 (one of the most scenic drives in the U.S. is Highway 12 from Capitol Reef down to the Bryce Canyon area) or from the eastern side, and the scenery is different but equally stunning.","January 6, 2017",Totally Under-Rated Park,21,"Seattle, Washington",5

This is because the approach routes have breathtaking scenery themselves - Rt 24 from the northeast and Rt 12 from the southwest. Then, the 20 mile round-trip drive in the park will just blow you away with its giant rock formations. There are plenty of places to stop and take pictures - I took a bunch.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Very nice Hiking trip of five days and four nights in Lower Muley Twist Canyon, from Burr Trail Switchbacks down to Halls Creek Narrows and backup via Grand Gulch and the Post CutOff. 53 miles or 85 km by foot, in five days. Quite difficult because you need to carry water a lot, like 4 liters each and five days worth of food. And difficult to find your way at times, since not enough signs, which should at least mark the trails junctions... Cairns are spare also...And the National Geographic map 2013 of Capitol Reef has a mistake on latitude scale! Should read 37°37'30"" and not 37°30' next to Halls Creek Narrows! Also when we got out of those notches the trail to come back was not indicated at all and we were heading south on a non existing trail on our map! Hopefully we realized it rapidly with the sun but this can be dangerous! You must have a GPS, the famous map (even with the mistake!) and a good sense of orientationEarly November is a good weather, but can be cold at night, like tonight the 17th, 27°F. During daytime we got 4-6°C, fair enough, able to walk in the desert with sleeve less camisole (hot walking with heavy backpacks). But November is a bad timing for restaurants or grocery.

There are old orchards where you can even pick the fruit if in season, along with some grassy areas for picnics. Also a shady pleasant developed campground, no reservations required but fills fast in the spring, summer, and fall seasons. This park is very remote and it takes real effort to get there.

Capitol Reef National Park,"The Waterpocket Fold is interesting but the general information does not do the park justice. It's the combination of things that makes this park interesting and enjoyable. The rock formations are very nice to look at, but not as dramatic as some of the other Utah parks. That does not make the park less enjoyable, however, especially if you are willing to spend a bit of time and energy. The history of the early Mormon settlers, Fruita area are interesting and gives you an appreciation of what life was like back then. The petroglyphs from ancient Indians are fascinating and you wonder how they got up there to draw the figures. The hikes are rewarding, especially the Grand Wash trail where you go through the Narrows. The 3pm ranger talk on the petroglyphs was very interesting. One item of importance is the designation of this park as a level one dark sky park, and with little infrastructure in the park and no nearby large towns, you get nice dark sky for star gazing. The day we were there, however, was full moon and we took a ranger led moonlight walk that was fantastic. We did a mile hike completely by moonlight and you can really appreciate how people can navigate and travel by moonlight in the past. You don't get near the crowds as Zion/Bryce/Arches so it still feels like a National Park, not an amusement park.

Of course, talk to the rangers at the visitors center first to help you plan your visit according to your interest. I've visited the park three times now and can say it is my favorite in Utah.

Capitol Reef National Park,"This lesser-known park was on our way to Bryce and Zion and was well worth the visit. There seem to be unlimited variations in the awe-inspiring terrain as you visit those areas. For us, Capitol Reef was a rather quick drive through, but included a stop to see the petroglyphs and the orientation video at the visitor center.

Capitol Reef National Park,"We used to spend a fair amount of time visiting family in Bicknell, but while there, we rarely spent time in Capitol Reef. I can't believe all that we missed out on. We recently decided to meet some family in Torrey and spend a few days hiking and exploring Capitol Reef, what a great adventure. We selected three hikes that would give us a nice broad picture of the parks and would not be overly challenging. We spent a few minutes in the morning at the Capitol Reef visitors center to get a detailed description of the hike we planned for the day and to get any up-to date information on our planned route. The first day we did Lower Spring Creek from the Chimney Rock down. This hike starts with a little climb then follows the wash all the way down to the Fremont, which you have to cross, so be prepared. The hike was about 10 miles and the views were absolutely stunning. We left a car at the lower end of the hike. We saw one other person, during the day.The next day we hiked Sheet Gulch. This hike is an out and back with the first mile or so in a wide open wash. The wash narrows and becomes a very nice slot canyon. There are a few obstacles to make it challenging. But nothing that is difficult or dangerous. The one page guide that we picked up at the Visitors Center was helpful. We had a planned turn-around time and arrived at a choke stone with a big pool of water just before our time. Rather than wade through the freezing water and climb the stone, we chose to turn around a few minutes early. There were lots of pieces of petrified wood that were fun to observe. We saw three people during the day on this out and back hike.The final day we hiked down Sulfur Creek to the Visitors Center. We started at the Chimney Rock parking lot and hiked about a mile down the trail on the south side of the road to the stream. We hiked down the stream most of the way. The couple that we were with indicated that the stream was carrying a little more water than they had experienced before. The water was fairly cold. Most of the time we walked in about ankle deep water, but there were a couple of spots where the water reach mid thigh. There were three waterfalls that we down climbed. From the bottom looking up, each one looked very simple. However, from the top looking down, they looked a little intimidating. The final water fall was very intimidating for my wife. The Trail Guide Sheet discusses a bypass, but the bypass was pretty intimidating as well. Finally, we saw a family go down who had some experience on the fall. Most of our party simply followed them. Once down it was a very easy thing to lift my wife down the seven foot fall, and then once down the fall does not look very intimidating. We saw two other groups during the day. This was a very special hike. The stream goes through narrows that are wonderful. At one point we were looking up at the goose neck overlook and watching people watch us. It was wonderful.One final note, be very aware of the weather. A storm in the area could create flash flood conditions that could easily be fatal to someone caught in the one of the canyons.","October 25, 2016",Splendid Fall Hiking,11,"Albuquerque, New Mexico",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"I was surprised at how busy it was on an October weekend, I thought that with the start of school and the colder weather that the crowds would go away. But I think that was too much to ask for...the weather was great and it was busy. The campground in the park is first come first serve, which I don't really like since it seems like you have to fight to get a spot, but we showed up at 11am and there were plenty of spots. Not the nicest campground, but it is right next to everything so great location. We picked a bunch of apples at the orchard next to the campground and when for a hike over an amazing canyon at the trail right across. Lots of interpretive trails and roads (which I love!).

When you loop back don't miss the great landscape view of the park at the end of the loop, great pics.

Capitol Reef National Park,"After hiking and UTVing our way through Utah and Canyonlands, we weren't sure what to expect with Capitol Reef. We camped on BLM land that night and our neighbours said they were ""disappointed"" with the park because it wasn't exciting. It deflated my hopes for the following day of exploring Capitol Reef.Well, I'm glad everyone has different tastes because we loved our time in Capitol Reef. We started with the Gifford House, where I spent over $200 on pies, jams, mugs and hand-stitched tea towels for family and friends. I fell in love with the park at that moment. The fall leaves were almost neon with the sun shining through them. We then took our pies to the river's edge where we let our pets run around on their leashes while we ate breakfast by the water. It was so peaceful! And it's amazing after being rejected everywhere in Arches and Canyonlands to have a spot our pets could run around. I guess there's so much deer poop, it doesn't matter. hahaAfter breakfast we wandered through the apple orchard. All the equipment is there to snag your own apples. You'll have the company of several deer, so watch out. They're not dangerous or aggressive but they did steal my apples off the ground more than once! haha I had to throw decoy apples in the opposite direction so I could keep the ones I was knocking down. It was really fun.Then we did the scenic drive. We stopped at Cassidy Arch viewpoint but, like a few other fellow travellers, never did find the viewpoint. All the sign had was an arrow but no map. If anyone knows how to get to the viewpoint, let me know for next time.We followed the road as far as it went and hiked to the ""tanks"". What a beautiful hike and shaded for most of it, which was welcome on a hot day. The next morning we went back and did the morning portion all over again (Gifford House, pies by the water, orchards) before hitching up and heading onward. It was definitely a relaxing highlight of the trip.","October 18, 2016","Quiet, relaxing park",237,"Vancouver, Canada",5

Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef National Park is a perfect place to visit because there is something for everyone. There are many easy hikes and long, difficult hikes. You can hike to arches and 4 wheel drive along the Burr Trail. The park is charming with wonderful camping spots, an original schoolhouse, orchards (which allow an honor system in a pay for what you pick) for fruit. There is a farmhouse with homemade ice cream, salsas, and pie. The visitor center is great and the rangers are always nice and suggest good hikes depending on your wishes. For those who don't want to get out of the car there is a scenic drive about ten minutes from the visitors center that has stunning scenery. There are petroglyphs along the road and though you can no longer hike up to them, they have placed binoculars for everyone to see them up close. In the summer, there are water hikes (one right behind the visitor center that often goes unnoticed) and you can wade and swim in the nice cool water. The Grand Wash is an easy walk and houses some hidden petroglyphs. I highly recommend exploring this park. Accommodations are also plentiful and cheap right outside the park and in Torrey.

The drive through the park (and along the main highway) is truly amazing with the canyon cliffs towering above you. There are many safe pullouts to stop in and just enjoy the scenery. Worth a trip into the visitor center to watch the short video there. The fee ($10 I think) seems to be more on the honor system. If you are a senior (over 60 or 62 I'm not sure) make sure you purchase a lifetime Senior Pass for $10 - ours has paid for itself over and over. It is good for NPs, National Monuments, BLM lands and the Red Rock pass in the Sedona, AZ area as well as many other government lands where a pass is required.

Capitol Reef National Park,"As noted in several reviews of Capitol Reef NP, we drove through it mainly because it is conveniently located between Moab and the Bryce+Zion parks. So why not check it out? And we are so glad we did! Driving through the main canyon, and looking WAY up at the massive rock walls filled with interesting patterns and colors-- Well, after exploring 4 other wonderful national parks, it was the first time the word ""majestic"" kept pouring out of our mouths over and over again! We saw a coyote pup alongside the road, as well as mule deer. We hiked only one trail -- the 2-mile round-trip Hickman Bridge Trail. The bridge is an impressive 125 ft tall natural arch and there are other interesting formations and flowers along the way. There were at least 20 other people on the trails, with accents from around the world. Amazing! Though rated as ""easy"" I think the trail is more ""moderate"" due to a fast increase in elevation initially and some confusing areas where the trail is obscured so you will likely add some difficulty climbing over boulders. Nearby there are many interesting landmarks of pioneer Mormon settlement in the area, especially in the town of Fruita. The fact that people settled in this glorious but challenging area somehow enhanced our appreciation of it. This place is an almost overwhelming combination of primordial splendor and domestic determination. For us that really sets this park apart from other isolated and uninhabitable wilderness areas!","October 10, 2016",Majestic!,23,"Austin, Texas",4

My husband wanted to do one of the more difficult trails past an old outlaw hideout, but I have to use walking sticks, so we ended up seeing the ancient rock paintings, and walking the easy Grand Wash for a ways, during our 1/2 day there. The receptionist at the motel that we stayed at sadly recounted how her family's ranch for generations had been on land now part of the Park, and how she longed to have their ranch back in the family -sans eminent domain. She recounted how her family now owned a B&B on the edge of the Park for their livelihood, and one of their more progressively socialistic guests suggested that it was too bad the federal government hadn't taken over their B&B as part of the Park as well!

The approach road is a dirt track and is narrow so it is not easy to reverse or turn around in.This NP is beautiful but is well off the beaten track and if you have seen Arches,Bryce and Zion then perhaps the detour is not necessary.

Capitol Reef National Park,"I have loved Capitol Reef since before it was a national park. In 1969 my parents brought us on a family road trip to Utah. As a 12 year old, I was totally mesmorized by this place, which was a national monument then. Almost 5 decades later, Capitol Reef holds the same magic and majesty for me; it remains my favorite park in Utah. Why? It has both tremendous raw beauty with its massive fiery red formations and it has a lovely cultural history with the Mormon lives spent there and the beautiful orchards they left behind still tended by the NPS. During our September visit we enjoyed the 1.8 mile round trip hike to Hickman Natural Bridge and also took the capitol gorge gravel road to its end and hiked the easy, level mile Capitol Gorge Trail to see an amazing petroglyph panel and a pioneer register with several hundred historic signatures. The campground was full all 3 days so we stayed at an RV park in Torrey where having a reservation is a good idea. We enjoyed picking apples and pears for $1.00/lb, with a scale, picking equipment and self pay station offered by the NPS. We took an AWESOME ride around the park, on the Burr Trail, starting in Torrey on Highway 12 and then turning onto Burr Trail at Boulder. We had great coffee and dessert at an eclectic coffee and gift shop in Boulder. The road winds through Grand Staircase Escalante Natl Monument for a time, providing spectacular views. The last part of the road, after the steep switchbacks, was very washboard-ey even in our Jeep. With a car though, you could easily go up to the switchbacks and turn around because the gravel is good from Boulder to the switchbacks. Don't miss Capitol Reef when in Utah.

Based solely on reviews that it was out of the way, less visited, etc. IMO, the write-ups do not do it justice. As great as Zion, GC and Bryce are, I thought Capitol Reef was spectacular. Certainly on par at least with all the rest. And, like some of the reviews clearly state, it IS in the middle of nowhere. Yet, the trip to the park from the west (Bryce) is a very nice 2 1/2 hour ride. Very pretty meadows and scenic country. Yet not spectacular in any way. Until you get to the park area. I was relieved/surprised/awed by the beauty. Incredible country. The park ride is as scenic as you can get. Don't be deterred by fact that road is dead end - it's one way in and out. It's certainly more than worth it.","September 26, 2016","Spectacular, even if you've been to Zion and Bryce",62,"Holmes Beach, Florida",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"We stopped at Capitol Reef on the way from Bryce Canyon heading for Mesa Verde, and only allocated a few hours (which I suspect most people do as well). Once we got there, we realized that we should have set aside a full day for hiking and picnicking. It may not be Utah's smallest park in terms of square miles, but it has to be the least visited. It's part of the Colorado plateau (same as Zion, Bryce, Canyonlands, and Arches), but it's got a different feel to it. If you're planning on driving only (and not hiking), be sure to continue past the end of the paved road. The unpaved section is drivable by cars and low-clearance SUVs, and (at least when we were there) didn't require all-wheel drive. You can get details on advisability of the drive at the visitors center but, if you can do it, you'll see a lot more (and more interesting) stuff than on the paved section.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Since we have been here several times, and time was short, we kept to the hwy 24 area and just past the visitor center. Grand Wash is a wonderful area to take a hike in a dry river bed. If it is, or has been raining, do not walk here as flash flooding can occur so fast. You can see tree trunks embedded in the side walls where the rushing water placed them. Don't ignore the warning signs if dark clouds are forming. There are many areas to stop and admire the tall rock walls that enclose the wash and several other places on the highway. Right inside the scenic drive area, you can view the Gifford house where they bake pies every day and also have needle work for sale. There is a large picnic area under the trees, which is great for a hot, summer day. Deer and horses are in this area and will stand still for photos. There is even a marmot who ""poses"" on the same rock all the time. :) If you are fortunate to be there during a fruit season, as we were for apricot season, you can eat all you want free while you are there and then purchase by the pound, at a very good price, to take with you. Naturally we had to pick a few pounds to eat later. Be careful of your shoes as they become coated with fruit that has fallen. Hint: don't wear your new shoes to pick fruit even though there is a clean up area by the restrooms.

From a geological point of view it is superb and clear to see how such stunning scenery was formed. The Visitor Centre, like most, is excellent with friendly staff, knowledgeable Rangers, nice gift shop and a very good 18min film showing twice an hour. What I thought was the greatest idea is the double sided A3 information sheet with simple maps and all the walking trails described in categories so you can make the right decision on what to do in the time you have. The Scenic Drive is a must-do to really understand the rock formation and do stop off at The Gifford House along the way to see the small one room museum and buy a delicious pie or bag of cookies or even a jar of jam.","September 11, 2016",Superb,137,"Bury, United Kingdom",5

The early residents dealt with alternating floods and droughts, trying to survive. You can drive the state highway through without paying, but if you use any of the features, you're supposed to pay. You could easily stay all day if you are attracted to unusual earth's crust. Bright, natural colors of all kinds. I found numerous oyster shells along Notom road, indicating a substantial sea thousands of years ago. There are nice houses, but the winter is long, cold, and extremely isolated and quiet.

Driving through the park and especially down into the gorge - all the way to the end - was amazing, haven't experienced anything like it! Warning, if there is any precipitation the road into the gorge will be closed (they get flash floods so it's for your safety) and the 2-3 miles down into the gorge are unpaved, but we managed it just fine in our Mini Cooper convertible. Awesome being surrounded by the towering rocks, we didn't see any wildlife and there doesn't seem to be a huge amount 'to do' in there, but we are drivers who love rocks and beautiful scenery so we were happy.

Capitol Reef National Park,"We stopped at Capital Reef almost by accident. It was on our way to other stops in Utah, and so we made a short stop there, only about 6 hours. Now we have to go back! The scenery there is awe-inspiring. Unlike other parks where many of the sites are confined to a small valley area, at Capital Reef the sites just go on and on. The park also has a little cluster of historic sites largely dedicated to mormon pioneers who settled the area. These were mildly interesting, but not as great as the natural sites.We took the scenic drive south from the visitor's center. This was a great 1-hour round-trip drive. It's indescribable. You just have to go. Sadly, we did not have time for any hikes. I would really suggest giving it more than just a few hours...their brochure kind of suggests that most people only visit for a few hours.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef surprised us. It is more of an intimate park than the others in Utah and there were not massive crowds. But what really won us over was the hike at the end of the scenic drive called the Capitol Gorge Trail. This hike, to me, was right out of every B western I ever watched where the cowboys chase the crooks down canyon trails, in this case a wash through canyon walls. What a terrific hike. The ranger says it is a mile to The Tanks, water pools, but I think it is longer as the entire hike took about 2.5 hours. We did go about a 1/2 mile beyond the tanks and then returned. There are no signs telling you where the end is, but the ranger said another 2 miles would have yielded a private property sign. This is an easy hike, mostly flat sand and small rocks as it is a wash. This is an intimate hike in that there are people but not crowds of people as the other national parks had this week. This factor made it most enjoyable and one of the highlights of our national park tour.The rest of capitol reef was similar to Canyonlands with tremendous vistas of massive rock cliffs that overwhelmed the senses with beauty. I think the smallness of the park and fewer crowds really won us over; it just felt more intimate.","August 24, 2016",Surprise of our trip,65,"Denver, Colorado",5

Loved it!We usually prefer to camp in the national parks but because this campground was first come, first serve, I booked a campsite off-site.

Capitol Reef National Park,"My 11 year old granddaughter and I did a trip through the Utah National Parks plus the Grand Canyon and this was one of our favorite parks. Yes it's free unless you do the scenic drive which I think is $10 a car. There is a self pay station at the beginning of it. We had a park pass so we didn't need to pay but it would have been worth it. The end turns to a dirt road which was really cool driving through this canyon area. I will include a picture.We did one of the ranger talks on the petroglyphs. It was fun for the kids, the ranger had some items to pass around and some tools the kids got to try. The ranger said it was her first week but she did a great job!There are also apricot orchards, you could pick a bushel for like a dollar. One of the trails we went on by the river had apricot trees and we picked some. They were really good. My granddaughter had never had one. She said ""I never knew I liked apricots!""There was an old settlement called Fruita. It was just a store that sold pies and nick nack type things, an old school house and a barn with a couple friendly horses that came over so you could pet them. I think they were looking for treats but you were not suppose to feed them.We did the petroglyphs trail at the end of the scenic drive. Was really cool, only a couple of petroglyphs but neat, then we went up to The Tanks which was basically a couple of muddy ponds. My granddaughter loved that part of the trail because it involved some climbing and looking for the cairns. Also did the chimney rock trail at the beginning of the park which was beautiful to see all the colors in the rocks. We did the Fremont River trail which started nice, going along the river, then through an area with trees and shrubs some were apricot trees. Then it went up the mountain, it kept going and going and we finally turned about but the views were awesome!Overall the park is just stunning how beautiful it is. If you are elderly or disabled this is a perfect park to visit. Nowhere near as crowded as the other parks we visited, there were several easy short trails and just driving through the park was a treat.If you are coming from Bryce be sure to take route 12 through Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument (no fee).

We sat by the house in the orchard under the trees and enjoyed the coffee and the amazing apple pie. Some people seem to compare it with Arches NP and say that Capitol Reef is maybe less impressive. I've seen both now and I can't agree. Capitol Reef is less big maybe especially when it come to big views but has some spectacular places and elements to it I really loved and you won't find in Arches.

Capitol Reef National Park,"This park has a different feeling than most national parks do. Stop at the Visitors Center and get a map and conditions with weather before you decide your plans. The weather plays a big part in hiking or back road driving. Most of the park south of the visitor's center follows the ""wash"" where rain collects and turns into a river with flash floods and can take your vehicle to places unknown. The roads follow and cross over the wash for many miles, but the views are spectacular! We went for a hike to see the pools of water and they were impressive. The hike through the canyon was amazing with walls straight up on both sides for the whole mile. This area is also part of the ""wash"". The trail from the bottom of the canyon to the pools was considered challenging because of the rough terrain you were climbing through and over. The trail was not easily marked going out, but coming back seemed to be better. You definitely need to use the markers and stay on the trail. There are miles of dirt roads you can explore, but again, watch the weather and consult a Ranger before heading out!

We visited some of the historical places in the park and then did the arch hike and some of the scenic loop.Our favorite part was that they let you pick fruit from the orchards and you can eat as much as you want as long as you don't take it out (otherwise there is a small fee per pound for fruit).

The geological history that is evident on the rock formations is fascinating as well as beautiful. The historical elements of the pioneers and fruit orchards are also interesting. Definitely recommend spending time in Fruita to pick from the orchards if one of their fruits is in season. We went during apricot season and were astounded by the numbers of apricots on the trees. Visitors may eat as many fresh, organic fruits from the trees as they like. The park even provides fruit pickers for visitors to use for hard-to-reach fruit. Any fruit that you would like to take with you is only $1.00/pound. A dollar per pound for you-pick organic fruit?! Unbelievable!

Rumor is that butch Cassidy used to hide out there. One of the highlights was the orchards. Apricots were in season and you can pick and eat as much as you want in the orchard. There's a very minimal charge for taking the fruit out of the grove. It's a favorite place for the deer to eat and watch them. Check out the website to see what is in season. ,"July 15, 2016",Capitol Reef - nice programs for kids and fun orchards ,138,"Arlington, Virginia",3
Capitol Reef National Park,"Located south of Torrey. It is not as busy as some of the other national parks in southeastern Utah. It's beautiful for the rock formations and the colors. It offers history about the pioneer Mormon settlers and a glimpse into the native Indians who inhabited the area.The Fruita orchards offer in season fruit to pick, eat, and take with you. The rate per pound of fruit you won't believe. The Gifford homestead is located inside the park as well. They offer camping, hiking, and wildlife viewing. It's a good idea to start hikes early and drink lots of water. It was awesome to see what the park has to offer. I would recommend adding it to your itinerary if you are going to visit southeastern Utah.","July 15, 2016",Awesome!,126,"Denver, Colorado",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"On a recent cross-country drive, we did a quick tour of national parks, including Capitol Reef. I'd heard of Arches, Canyonlands, Bryce Canyon, etc. and was definitely looking forward to those, but Capitol Reef wasn't one I knew anything about, and we considered skipping it, especially as we saw the less-than-stellar scenery leading up to the park. I am SO glad we didn't, and only wish we'd allowed ourselves more time to explore. The stunning rock walls glowed in the afternoon light, and the lovely green of the valley was the perfect complement. We saw more wildlife during our few hours there than in the three days we spent at other parks, and I found the whole experience wonderfully relaxing. Next time we plan a similar park tour, I expect that Capitol Reef will feature MUCH more prominently.","July 14, 2016",Highlight of our Trip,63,"Sheboygan, Wisconsin",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"Amazing, breathtaking, awe-inspiring views for miles before the park entrance and throughout the entire park. Quite frankly, I'd never heard of this park...and what a shame because it is so beautiful. I loved the Fruita Historic District...the history, the fruit trees, and the beauty! Picking my own apricots was fun! There are several stops to pick your own fruit. I'd recommend NOT stopping at the first few as they've been pretty picked over. There is an orchard near the campground that was FULL of fruit. The campground looked nice. This park was defiely worth the trip!","July 13, 2016","Amazing, breathtaking, awe-inspiring views",116,"Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"What we have learned about each of the national parks we visited on our 4,500 mile summer road trip was that each one is SO different from the rest. Capitol Reef is smaller and inviting- and just gorgeous! Nowhere else are you going to see such beautiful rock formations. Stop at the petroglyph wall- slow down and really look for each one. They are amazingly old- really puts our time here on Earth in perspective.","July 12, 2016",Loved This Park!,100,"Atlanta, Georgia",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"As another review said...we wish we had planned to stay longer. We stopped on our drive from Moab to Bryce. The place is stunningly beautiful. Were only able to do the drive in the park and take in a short hike, but soooo worth it. One of our favorite places that we visited on our trip. It's a well hidden gem, as I don't think this park has as many visitors as the other parks. Make sure you stop for some pie...delish!","July 11, 2016",SOOOOOO glad we took the time to visit!

Capitol Reef National Park,We stopped here for a day. I wish we would have planned to stay longer. This place is as beautiful as Zion but with a lot less people. In the valley between the massive multicolored rock is a green valley with grass and fruit trees. There is remnants of the first settlers to the area. We hiked to Hickman Bridge.

Drive through then try doing a trail or two. The Hickman Natural Bridge Trail is awesome. It's not a flat trail. Be prepared to do a lot of uphill stairs. Not too bad if you take your time.

Capitol Reef is AMAZING! We were sunburned, and worn out from the previous day at Bryce, and short on time so I didn't do much hiking. but it looked like there were plenty of options for great hiking. We took the short scenic drive.(all the drive in and around Capitol Reef is technically a scenic drive!) Stopped for Pie and Ice Cream at the little homestead house. and were blown away by this unheralded gem. We got the little two dollar scenic drive map at the great Visitors center and mom read off the info as we drove through. Very special Park here!

Capitol Reef National Park,"I know it's not the most sold NP but worth the effort. We started with a stop at visitor center where rangers gave us some ideas. We opted to do a hike to the Hickman Bridge. Awesome. Take water and a camera and you will love the trip. It's a decent hike but the bridge is superb. Photos are going to be great. After, a drive through the park. Amazing colors, great images, different shapes, sizes and shadows. We also took a small off road (2 km long) which made a difference. It's called Grand Wash. Give it a try. We ended at the Gifford House, a nice small house selling kitchen stuff and amazing pies. A good visit. Enchanted.","July 4, 2016",Different but beautiful,386,"Bucharest, Romania",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"I have to admit that Bryce Canyon is still my favorite Utah National Park, but I hadn't visited this one before and was glad I made the time to see it. We spent the better part of two days here and thought it was time enough to get a reasonable overview of the park. We did several hikes (Hickman Bridge, Cassidy Arch, Capitol Gorge) and saw the petroglyphs and various buildings left from the early white settlers.The landscapes here are very unique. Lots of rock formations and colors in that rock. Just driving the highway (Utah 24) or the offshoot Scenic Road was enough to get a flavor for the park, but it was nice to take some hikes to get up close and personal with it.Note that unlike most National Parks that I've been to, there is no guard station/entry - it's free to drive through and visit most of the park. The only fee is for the Scenic Road, which was only $10 (and free because I have a 4th grader). You definitely get a lot of bang for your buck!","July 3, 2016",Not my favorite Utah park but still worth visiting,396,"Portland, Oregon",4

Capitol Reef National Park,"After visiting Bryce and Zion National Parks, this was a stark contrast to the other landscapes. As we drove the scenic route and stopped numerous times to take pictures, the open expanse of land was amazing as it stretched as far as you could see. The changing dynamics of the terrain was absolutely remarkable. This is a definite stop if you are in the area.","June 29, 2016",Much different than Bryce and Zion,221,"Cincinnati, Ohio",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"Since this National Park is situated in the middle of the state, it doesn’t gather as many visitors or get as much attention as the National Parks near the east and west borders (Zion, Bryce, Arches and Canyonlands). However, even if you don’t take the time to get out and do some hiking, you’ll find the drive through this park loaded with just as much scenic beauty as those other parks. A huge bonus is you won’t find the crowds they have either. With so many trails to choose from and only so much time to work with, it was hard for us to pick which hikes would be the best. We enjoyed the Hickman Bridge trail, which is a nice 2 mile round-trip moderate hike that leads you to the Hickman natural bridge. We also drove along the Grand Wash road and stopped to get out and take an easy stroll through the wash basin which led us to the Oyler mines. These mines, which are closed off, produced uranium ore in the early 1900’s. I’m not sure if there is any danger of radiation exposure but at least we saw we weren’t glowing in the dark later that night back at the hotel. It would be nice to come back here when we have more time for hiking and also sample the fruit when it is in season.","June 29, 2016",Capitol Reef rules!,49,"Saint Paul, Minnesota",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"We almost skipped going to this National park on our tour of parks and are so very glad we didn't! This park is a little out of the way when you compare its locations to other parks in Utah, but it is well worth the side trip. The stone formations are very impressive. The hiking trails are great with towering rock cliffs on both sides of you. It is a park you can drive through in half a day or take a day to drive and hike. There aren't many facilities, but it is a great place for a picnic. There is a bakery that makes fresh great tasting pies and bread. A must stop! The visitor center is nice, but not as impressive as other parks. A park that has hikes you can take kids on and not be too worried about their safety. It was great because it wasn't crowded.","June 28, 2016",A Welcome Surprise,20,"Eau Claire, Wisconsin",5

Capitol Reef National Park,"We came for a weekend with our two boys (7 and 3). On our first day we hiked to Hickman Bridge in the morning, which is a great hike. The boys were a little tired but loved exploring the little crevices in the walls on the way up. Scrambling over rocks was a bit hit as well. At the end they were hot and tired so we went into Torrey for lunch to regroup. If I had planned ahead better we could have picnicked in the shady orchard areas in Fruita. In the afternoon we drove down the scenic road and did the Capitol Gorge hike. This was a cool walk; easy, shady and good for my little ones. The next morning we got cinnamon rolls and pie for breakfast at the Gifford House and went to see the petroglyphs. I have been to Arches before and I love it there, but Capitol Reef is definitely also worth a visit!

This park is less crowded than other parks in Utah and thus more relaxing. As in all of our state parks, the information center is excellent. If you want to hike or go horseback riding in the summer, go very early. By noon it is at least 100 degrees. We will definitely return here in the fall or early winter to hike.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Ranger Gary at the Capitol Reef visitor center was so knowledgeable & enthusiastic! He had done quite a lot of hiking in the park recently & definitely had first hand information. I can't say enough about Ranger Gary! He's the best! His first suggestion was to hike the ""Fremont River Gorge Overlook trail"" late afternoon/early evening to capture the beauty of the sunset. The overlook is dramatic & the evening colors are so lovely. We encountered only one other hiker on this trail, yet there were over 2,000 visitors to the park over Memorial Day weekend. To avoid the crowds, simply jump onto a trail!Our next hike was the ""Navajo Knobs trail"". This is more challenging due to sun exposure. Carry plenty of water. It's a busy trail the first mile because most hikers are hiking to Hickman Bridge. After the turnoff to Hickman Bridge the foot traffic really diminishes. It's a fairly long hike and best to start early while the temperature is comfortable. The views from the rim overlook are dramatic & the geology is simply amazing. Our final hike was ""Upper Muley Twist trail"". To access the trailhead, you need high clearance 4-wheel drive! Don't underestimate this warning. The boulders are large!!! But the hike is so worth it. It takes some time to get to the trailhead on the Notom-Bullfrog Road & the hike is long. Take plenty of water, food & get an early start. The trail is only marked by cairns, so be sure to watch for them. It's easy to become confused, so having a hiking buddy is helpful. You will be boulder scrambling from time to time. The views of the water pocket fold were outstanding. Again, only a handful of hikers. You really get to experience the solitude of the area & it simply takes your breath away! To return to the park, we made a loop drive and returned on the Burr Trail Road. By driving one direction, we only had to drive through the hair-raising Burr Trail Switchbacks once! My husband & I also took a day and drove the beautiful Cathedral Valley Loop Road. Be sure to check with the rangers regarding the condition of this road and water level at the river ford. Again, 4 wheel drive is strongly recommended...especially to ford the Fremont River when water levels are high! Set aside a full day to allow for short hikes to stunning overlooks. We found a picnic table at the Upper South Desert Overlook. The scenery along the drive was absolutely gorgeous and very few vehicles.Lastly, we purchased home-made pies at the Gifford House. The pies were divine...definitely a must do. We only spent 3 full days at Capitol Reef and wish we had set more time aside. The early morning starts on our hikes & drives gave us an opportunity to view deer, wild turkeys, cotton-tail & jack rabbits.","June 23, 2016",Perfect fit for seasoned hikers!,208,"West Linn, Oregon",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"On a random Wednesday in April, I decided to take the 3 hour drive down to CReef for the day. What a memorable day trip it was. This was a ideal time to go since the weather was pleasant and warm as opposed to the unbearably hot days that hits the park come mid May to early Sept. This was the 1st time I had been here, so upon arrival, I headed to the info shop right there a few miles into the park. I asked the ranger the best hikes for a person in shape who wanted to see the park. I was directed for the first into a slot canyon and then to the Cassidy Arch Trail which rose above the slot canyon I was beginning the 1st hike on. the views were incredible from both options. Each hike too about an hour and a half back and forth for a total of 11 or so miles. In the afternoon, I drove the scenic route in the park and did a short hike at the end of this route. Gorgeous views accompany all the hikes here, but some are def more challenging than others. Be sure to ask the ranger at the info house what is best suited for you and your abilities. There was no crowds whatsoever on this day trip.","June 23, 2016","Lesser known than Zion and Bryce, but that's a good thing",7,,5

Stopped at the homestead for pie, local sarsaparilla, and ice cream! The pies are to die for. At 2 places we got off the main road and followed dirt roads for a couple miles (hey, its a rental car :o) to find some really spectacular areas. Down the road are some petroglyphs and they're really a worthwhile stop! Had trouble seeing them at first, I guess we were expecting lights and arrows, but they are really something.

Trail heads were well marked and there is an abundance of information available regarding the trails from either the park service, online sites, reviews, blogs and various Utah web sites including Utah.Com. Visitor Information Center in Fruita is a must first stop. The Park Rangers are very helpful and informative. This park is remote and not a place to visit if you are looking for quaint shops or fine dining experiences. Cell phone service is non-existent in most areas of the park. Be sure to do your research so that you will have an idea which trails may be of most interest before arriving and have an idea of what you would like to do. The rangers can then confirm or suggest alternatives to your plans. Hiking is definitely the main attraction with many dedicated bicycle riders around challenging the steep grades along the scenic roads in the area. We would hike one trail in the morning and one in the afternoon. The Subway Sandwich shop in Correy was our stop for lunch between hikes, Bring your own water, most trail heads do not have water available. Saw many campers although most camp grounds we saw were posting No Vacancy notices so reserve your site early.Note that we reviewed the area by Google Earth before coming.

The trails, historic area, and visitor center provided more than enough activities for us. We were traveling in a rented SUV, so we did not attempt the areas that require 4WD – if you plan for that, you’ll want more than three nights just to enjoy it all. Without 4WD, anyone with the mobility and desire for hiking may want at least 3 nights in order to have two full days for the park. We also enjoyed part of a day on US 12 and Burr Trail Road. Four nights would have been good for more hiking. Of the trails that we took, Hickman Bridge was our favorite. We took both the Grand Wash and Capitol Gorge trails; in hindsight, I wish we had done just one of the two and used the other time for a different trail.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Driving in on Route 24 from the east, we were overwhelmed by the ""spectacularness"" of Capitol Reef! Humongous red rocks looming on the sides of the road gave us so many options to stop and take pictures. We spent two nights in Torrey so we could have a full day in this park. Once in the park, we stopped in the visitor center, which offers outstanding displays and ranger talks. We partook in the geology talk (at 10 am I believe) and learned a tremendous amount about the formation of the area (starting hundreds of millions of years ago) and the composition of the rocks. Our ranger was a geology major and tackled a complicated topic in a way that we truly understood. Her 30 minute program gave us a great basis for identifying what we saw in the park...I strongly recommend the ""geology talk"" outside the visitor center! Loaded with knowledge, we ventured into the park where Mother Nature's show expanded with the largest variety of colors and formations we saw on our Utah parks road-trip. We stopped at several overlooks, but also took a few drives off the main route. Our first was a bumpy excursion down a wash (open only when there's no threat of flooding). Though the road was unpaved, we were able to safely drive it in a sedan. Our second was through the fold, also on an unpaved road. Both drives ended in a parking lot with covered picnic shelters and trails in several directions. Capitol Reef is a ""must see"" Utah park! We are not hikers and spent around 4 hours there. There are plenty of hiking opportunities though - from easy to difficult. We brought in our lunch and several bottles of water. Pack sunscreen, sunglasses and a hat.

There were lots if narrows and you could just imagine and wonder how those pioneers survived the wilderness.There is a 2 mile round trip hike at the end of the drive. Frankly, it was ok. We had better hikes, but again the drive was worth doing. If you decide to continue on the hike, make sure you bring the enough water especially if you go in the summer. Also, this is something we learned on this trip, always go in hiking in the morning. This is true for this hike because after 11p, the whole place was blazed with the sun that there is no shade anywhere on the hike. I'm not kidding. No shade at all.

Capitol Reef National Park,Lovely scenery but fabulously interesting from a historic perspective. Take you car up to Capitol Gorge and then walk into the gorge. It's not difficult but is a way of understanding what early settlers had to undergo when they drove wagons and horses through this canyon - you can still see the old wagon route.Don't miss the Goosenecks overlook (back on highway 24 outside the park gates).

The rangers are very helpful in guding you to various hikes and what the rocks are made of. Stop at Gifford House in the am for pies - at 8:30 they were still warm. The strawberry-rhubarb was fantastic - thought about getting some ice cream for ala mode but that seemed really decadent for breakfast.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Capital Reef National Park faces west so it is fundamentally an afternoon backdrop for photographers. I drove here from Bryce Canyon and Kodochrome Basin and arrived in the middle of the day. If you are driving from Moab, stop at Goblin Valley so you arrive at Capital Reef in the middle of the day. The area just past the entrance where the photogenic Gifford Farmhouse and Barn is located is best photographed at sunrise and sunset. Drive to the end of the scenic road and then work your way back. Don't forget to drive to the end of the Grand Wash and then hike as far as you want along the trail there. Absolutely spectacular. The drive into the Park from Torrey is stunning and breathtaking to say the least.

I visited this park on the same day I went to Bryce (yeah, it was a looong day) and it's totally doable. Capitol Reef is so different from the other four mainly because it preserves a Mormon settlement. I really loved the Fruita area. The farmlands against the desert backdrop lent themselves to amazing photographs. I enjoyed a very large peach pie in the picnic area as well. The petroglyphs were very interesting and the scenic drive was a blast.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef kind of gets lost between Zion, Bryce, and Arches. While it is not as good as the aforementioned parks, it is gorgeous and should at least be a stop on a tour of the Utah national parks. Between Moab and Bryce Canyon, you can take the backroads and cross through Capitol Reef. It's not much of a detour and absolutely worth it. We didn't have a ton of time to tour the park, but we felt a good few hours was enough here. Goosenecks Overlook was the best view in the park and rivals some of Grand Canyons overlooks. The longer hikes are likely very tough to bear given the desert climate and it seems there is little payoff as many of the overlooks here would have equally good views. We did do the Hickman Bridge hike, which gives you a nice slice of Capitol Reef hiking without wasting a lot of time (maybe an hour). The scenic drive is pretty and Fruita is a bit smaller than I originally thought. Capitol Reef also has a petroglyph stop on the roadside, but is not very impressive. Make a nice little trip of your drive between Bryce and Moab and stop at Capitol Reef.","May 11, 2016",Lost in the crowd,465,"New Orleans, Louisiana",4

Capitol Reef National Park,"If you had never seen Arches, Canyonlands or Zion, this would be the most amazing place you ever saw. Even if you have seen the more spectacular parks, this one has treasures of its own, such as the golden layers of rock mixed in with the red sandstone it has in common with Bryce and Zion. With the prevalence of dirt roads in (usually) dry washes, it also offers the shiver of excitement of knowing you might be swept away on a flash flood if rain comes in before you expect it. Several great short hikes are available, of which I give my highest recommendation of the Strike Valley overlook--harder to get to but well worth it. While you are in the area, you should also consider the opportunity to drive south to Boulder and eat at Hell's Backbone Grill. It's on the way to Bryce and Zion, and an incredibly scenic way to get there.","May 5, 2016",Worth a detour,61,"San Francisco, California",4
Capitol Reef National Park,"Incredible park given its small size. It was bustling in mid-September, and the park’s main Fruita Campground was completely booked (we were not staying there anyway). But for future reference, the campsites were all pleasant little shady spots over grassy areas. Rather than reviewing the hikes we did (which I'll do separately), I'll discuss the amenities.The Visitor’s Center was crowded upon our arrival, but the rangers we encountered here and throughout the park were always friendly and eager to engage. Very easy to get around if you have a vehicle, and as hikers, we found a plethora of interesting trails and points of interest including towering canyon walls, sandy washes, arches, petroglyphs, and riverside walks. Although Capitol Reef is the little one compared to UT’s other parks, it was never boring during our 2.5-day visit.A fun perk is that Capitol Reef has several U-Pick-Em orchards within the park, and since we were there during harvest season, we grabbed some delicious pears, apples, etc. Each orchard has limited parking available, but we never had problems finding a spot for our truck. They provide bags, a scale, and money box with the rate displayed. It’s on the honor system so just weigh your picks and drop the cash payment into the box.Like many national parks, there are many areas closed off to pets.We need to go back!","May 2, 2016",Amazeballz!,264,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"If you're driving from Moab to Torrey, your route will take you right through this park. We stopped at the orchard to pick apples, at the petroglyphs, and at a one-room schoolhouse. We enjoyed all of this, even though we knew we really didn't see much of the park.At the orchard, you can eat apples inside the orchard for free, but you have to pay for any you take with you. There is a scale there, and some bags. You deposit your money in a little box. It's on the honor system.The petroglyphs were amazing. We arrived just after a ranger talk, darn it! At first, I couldn't see the drawings. I just couldn't make them out on the walls. My husband's camera has a serious zoom lens, and that helped a LOT. There is a boardwalk that winds around the rock walls so that you can see lots of different drawings, so definitely do this short walk. There are viewfinders along the walkway to help you see the petroglyphs.At the little one-room school, there is an informational sign with a button you can push to hear a recording by a woman who actually taught there many years ago. As a retired teacher, I found her remarks to be extremely interesting. We also saw a flock of wild turkeys in the field beside the school. They made their way across the road, where they joined some deer in another field.Even if you can't devote a lot of time to this park, there are still a number of enjoyable stops as you drive through it.","May 1, 2016",Drove through going from Moab to Torrey,163,"Hickory, North Carolina",4

We checked out the visitor center and movie, drove the scenic drive to Gifford house (be sure to buy pie), nature center (was closed when we were there), and blacksmith shop, and then took a lovely, easy hike (Grand Wash, 4.4 miles roundtrip). As we headed east, we stopped at the petroglyphs, historic school house, and Behunin cabin along Hwy 24.

Stop at the visitor center and learn how all of the rock formations, it gives a great perspective on how all of these unique-looking rocks got there. It has a fascinating history to it. Go on the scenic drive. The views from the road were spectacular, but if you really want your jaw dropped, take a drive through the Grand Wash and the other gorges along the way. The road is slightly rough, but it should be ok for most cars. The naturally-carved gorges really allow you to dive into the park and experience all of the formations first hand. Just don't be that guy who takes an RV through them — some of the corners can be pretty tight. We did the park an afternoon, although I wish we had more time to go on the trails.

We did the Hickman trail to get an orientation of the geology, plant life and the relics of ancient peoples which once lived in this area. This trail also has the natural bridge which is perhaps the most iconic feature in the park. In fact there is much to see throughout the park besides this rock formation.

Capitol Reef National Park,"My camera was overworked in the park . From the moment we entered there was beauty at every turn . In some areas we took our time and others we rushed through . It was obvious we needed more time , so we saw a few things and then headed to Torrey because the sun was close to setting and it was Sunday . As it turned out we were lucky because Torrey basically closes at 7 on Sundays in mid March . We found a place to stay and a restaurant just before it closed .  The next morning we headed out early and saw the western section of the park . Will still could have spent another half a day here . A few interesting rock formations are alongside the highway . The scenic drive was pretty and the Goosenecks was stunning .  The visitor center people were very informative . Just down the road there is a house that serves pie . It was the first day of the year for this . The ranger made it sound very tempting , but we weren't hungry at the time .  There is still alot to discover , so I hope a return visit will be in our future .","March 23, 2016","Arriving from the east , we had to stop at every pull out . So beautiful !",299,Vancouver,5
Capitol Reef National Park,"We were just going to drive through Capitol Reef NP because none of us had herd much about it. But once I started doing some research it looked like we couldn't just pass it by, and I'm so happy we didn't! Especially for Cohab Trail and the Fruita Barn. Cohad trail has a few different turns once you get to the top but we were happy with just exploring around there. It was a little over a mile and had an incredible view. There is a longer hike called Grand Wash where you walk through the bottom of the canyon, another name for this is The Narrows. I honestly don't know why I didn't hear more about Capitol Reef before we came, it was beautiful! We were here the last day of February, the weather was perfect and there was no one around.

It had snowed and the white dusting gave the red rocks particularly brilliant glow in the bright sun. Do not miss the scenic 11 miles drive, the road winds around some spectacular rock formations, it is truly a beautiful drive. One of the best places to watch the sunrise and the sunset is the Panorama point and Goosenecks Overlook. It is easily accessible from the highway. It was amazing to watch the sun illuminating the tops of the snow caped mountains and the beautifully saturated colors of the red rocks as the sun was rising. We were lucky to have some memorable sunrises that made for great photos. Cant wait to visit again soon.","January 26, 2016",Gorgeous in the winter,171,"New York City, New York",5

Capitol Reef National Park,"Why have all the stress of Black Friday when you can enjoy the 4-day weekend in peace and quiet hiking? We decided to leave town, family and the hectic rush of holiday shopping and enjoy a beautiful and peaceful hiking experience in Capitol Reef National Park. If you can handle the cold, Capitol Reef is such a beautiful place! We hiked for 3 days Friday through Sunday. Everyday was between 20 to 30 degrees but so worth it. We dressed in layers to keep warm and even having to remove hats and scarves because we got too warm. The benefit of hiking during this time is there is nobody on the trails. It was so nice to not be competing for hiking space. The views are amazing! The colors are so varied and beautiful! Pictures do not do this place justice. And... it only costs you $10 for a 7 day pass. Totally worth it! There is so much to see in the place that we could have used at least two more days. We started at the visitor's center to get a map. They were very helpful at guiding us to the best hiking places for the time we had. The Hickman Bridge hike is a great hike! It takes you to a amazing natural bridge. After that we took the scenic drive that takes you to Grand Wash Road. Take this drive and then get out of your car and do the hike! It is amazing! It is so peaceful and quiet with towering walls and formations. Awesome!!! Next, drive the Notom-Bullfrog Road all the way to the Surprise Canyon and Headquarters Canyon hikes. The drive starts out on paved road and then for about 30 miles it goes to a dirt road. It was dry so my Nissan Ultima made it. The road is pretty flat but it does have some wash-board sections. We did both of these hikes. If you only have time to do one, do the Headquarters Canyon hike. There are sections with a very narrow ""narrows"" The hike is flat and pretty easy but in the beginning you have to cross a ravine, which you have to climb down into and back out of. If wet, it could be muddy. The trail is not marked very well so look for the flat areas and the Cairns. In all our trip to Capitol Reef was a much needed break from hectic work life. It is so uncrowded this time of year and the experience of nature and beauty shows you what is important in life.

Not to be missed is the scenic drive to the very end, driving all the way down to the end of the gorge. It's like nothing else we have ever seen.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Certainly in the UK this is one of the lesser known US National Parks, probably because visitors from the UK generally want to pack a lot into a short visit and this park is not on a direct route between other more famous attractions.This is a shame as it has much to offer even on a short visit. My wife and I visited recently as part of a road trip visiting a number of SW National Parks and would have liked to spend longer than we did. Driving a rental SUV we were not able to travel the 4WD tracks but we did visit the petroglyphs which were well worth the visit. But the real star of the show for us is the spectacular drive along the scenic route through the gorge right to the end. (Not possible during or immediately after heavy rain or when it is predicted because of the risk of flash flooding) It is certainly worth a 2 hour or more visit / detour. My wife couldn't stop clicking the camera, even while we were driving! However, even if you can only drive the Utah 24 route through the park you should certainly take the opportunity to do so if you possibly can and stop at the various turnouts.

This place is special. Mostly foreigners. Lots of the drive in the attraction is paved, two way and fairly narrow. The speed limit is 10-25 mph, but often ignored and unsafe. Eventually, the road is unpaved, bumpy and narrow. Several places are hard to pass. This road was busy, but only a fraction of the visitors make this part of the area. Again the speed limits are 10-25 MPH, but often ignored to cause many close calls and dirt skids. Eventually you get to a parking area. From here there is a mile or so hike to the pots.

Capitol Reef National Park,"This park is located in south-central Utah in the heart of red rock country. It is a hidden treasure filled with cliffs, canyons, domes and bridges. Named for what it looks like (white rock domes like the U.S. Capitol, rocky ridges like marine reefs). Depending on where you stand, the stripes (some white and some tan) on these red Navajo sandstones are half an inch or half a mile wide. I especially enjoyed Chimney Rock, a 400-foot-tall sandstone pillar. Hickman Bridge is a huge natural arch spanning 133 feet wide and is 125 feet tall.The trail is two miles roundtrip, with a 300-foot incline, therefore we did not attempt it. The park is so uncrowded that you feel you are on a planet. Early inhabitants referred to the area as the “land of the sleeping rainbow” because of its beautiful contrasts: multi-colored sandstone surrounded by green riverbanks and arid desert vegetation. The Capitol Gorge trail is a must see. There are many scenic views of Capital Reef which will give your camera a workout. From the moment that you turn off the paved road it gets better and better as you proceed down into the winding canyon with sandstone walls closing in on you to the narrow high canyon walls. The dirt road is smooth enough for a passenger car as long as you drive slowly. Cathedral Valley is a remote area in the northern end of the park where enormous monoliths soar hundreds of feet high.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef was a surprise. Althoughthere are some hiking trails that we did not use, it seemed to be primarily a driving tour. The main highway that cuts across the park from east-west plus the scenic drive that goes south of the Visitor Center.Unlike many of the NP in the area where most of what you are looking at is down, or off in the distance, this park has the rock formations close to the road and since you are on the river bottom most of what you want to see is up. A nice change and very scenic.Best viewed via convertible so you don't miss a thing. Because it is so close and upward, you may miss a lot during the drive. There are plenty of pullouts to let you get a look at the more well known sights, but a convertible with the top down really adds to the experience.. If you stick to driving you can do the east/west and scenic drive in a few hours.","October 12, 2015",Great scenic views,13,"Centuria, Wisconsin",5

Capitol Reef National Park,"While at staying inTropic, Utah to visit Bryce Canyon National Park, we had extra time to explore and to do a day trip to Capitol Reef Natiobal Park and it was certainly worth the effort. We drove out of Tropic on Rte 12 towards Escalante and it was quite the scenic ride. There is a place called ""Hogs Back"" that will give you white knuckles and sweaty palms but the views are spectacular. If you are afraid of heights then you should probably take an alternate route.

Sill a magnificent park with great views from the trails with a little climbing. There are still a lot of unpaved roads to trailheads but they are well maintained and should pose no problem.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Our first trip to Capitol Reef National Park was eye-opening -- to say the least. We drove the automobile tour, and every stop had splendid vistas. The highlight of our tour was the Hickman Natural Bridge. Some of it is moderately strenuous, with the 400-foot increase in elevation adding to the challenge. Worth the time and effort. Another interesting feature of the park were the orchards -- artifacts of 19th century settlers in the area. While we were there (in September), apples were on many trees. Visitors were welcome to pick the fruit. Any that they ate in the orchard was free. Any that they took was priced at $1/pound. Finally, the petroglyphs are a must-see.","September 29, 2015",A wonderful national park worth at least a day to visit,88,"Amazonia, Missouri",4

During late summer visitors can pick apples and peaches in the Fruita Historic District inside the park. Stop in at the general store for a slice of homemade pie, take it outside to a picnic table and enjoy the view. The campground fills up fast so get their early.

Capitol Reef National Park,"As we headed for Capitol Reef from Moab the weather had changed and the sky had turned black, then opened up with heavy rain. We thought we might not be able to stop with the bad weather, but by the time we reached the park area the sun had broken through a little enabling us to stop along the way. Because of the heavy rain the Fremont River was is torrent mode, making some small muddy brown waterfalls along the way. The drive itself is beautiful, one which we have done before and were glad to be doing again, and would recommend a visit. While the weather was good we did the walk to the Hickman Natural Bridge, a one mile each way easy walk with a 400 foot elevation, taking around 2 hours to complete. There is little shade along the way so dress accordingly and don't forget your water. The views along the way are great as it Hickman Bridge. There is a Visitors Centre in the park with lots of information and things to buy. Due to the bad weather over the last week or so, some parts of the park were not accessible so we missed out on other areas.","September 23, 2015",Scenic Drive,159,"Fern Bay, Australia",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"The park is worth the trip. I like the remote location. The scenic drive was easy to do. We did hike the Grand Wash trail which was easy. The Petroglyph panel was interesting to see along with new graffiti. Would have attended the star grazing event but felt the cliffs would get in the way. We did our star grazing at Panorama Point (outstanding views in the day time too) along with several other cars. Left the park heading east to Moab and terrain was quite different and very unique but a word of caution, no services along the way. The entrance fee was $10 and you place your money in an envelope before entering the scenic drive.

You can pick the fruit and eat it in the orchards or have a personal homemade pie at the Gifford Museum. We attend a ranger-led talk at the Amphitheatre which was helpful and they also have stargazing sessions each evening.

The only drawback to going is the trip--we drove from Moab, probably 2.5 hrs. through a lot of nothingness. We wouldn't have dared stop the car anywhere en route. But Capitol Reef itself is imposing and dramatic. Lots of great places to stop and admire the red rocks all around. We had storms threatening so didn't hike, just drove the scenic route. Couple dining choices in Torrey, nothing in the park.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef was our latest NP in our quest to hit them all. It's a nice park with some good scenery. The waterpocket feature is really neat to see. It's fascinating to think what the earth has been through. It was just given a ""dark skies"" certification for the lack of light intrusion at night. We camped at the Cedar Mesa campground and the stars did not disappoint. Since the park is centered mainly around the waterpocket there's not much variety in the land features. Is it worth the trip if you're not trying to see all the parks? It's a tough call as you can see most of the park in a day or two. The Cathedral area is very difficult to access, which is really disappointing. If you don't have a 4WD with high clearance I wouldn't suggest trying. I was surprised at the lack of maintenance/attempt to give people better access by leaving the unpaved roads so unchecked. The surrounding BLM areas had better unpaved roads. The nice part is that you don't need to pay the park fee to see the best parts of the park.","September 12, 2015",A nice national park,35,,4

However, I'm sure some of the more challenging off road trails would require a 4WD vehicle.Overall, Capitol Reef is certainly worth a visit.

In fact if you can enter that way, your life will be all the better for it. Also, if you are adventurous and have a 4WD vehicle, venture out on Cathedral Valley Road.

Both hikes are a must do in my opinion. In the same day we also drove the Scenic drive, visited the Fremont petroglyphs, bought pie at the historic Gifford house (strawberry rhubarb was delicious), peeked in the windows of the school house, walked around the Goosenecks overlook and watched the sun go down from Sunset point (get there early to watch the colours change).

Wild deer roam this area and they are not afraid of dogs or probably anything at this point. We watched a small doe stand her ground and even half way charge at a dog on a leash that really wanted to play with the herd.

We took the scenic drive and the spur roads into Grand Wash and Capitol Gorge. All roads were fine to drive in our rental car. The sights were incredible. Capitol Reef gets it's name from 2 types of formations found there. The Capitols are the white rounded domes reminiscent of a capitol building. The Reefs are the sheer multicolored cliffs rising along the road. The waterpocket fold is another geologic feature that is unique to the park. But geologic history is not the only thing showcased here. Human history is found in petroglyphs created centuries ago. The area was also an early Mormon settlement which had extensive orchards. The orchards are still there and you can pick fruit when it's available. There are also several historic buildings from that time. A highlight of the day was buying a small cherry pie and homemade ice cream for a snack. We ate it in the valley under a tree while a deer snacked nearby on the grass.

Capitol Reef National Park,"My sister and I spent one day in Capitol Reef, hiking, sightseeing, and driving some of the park's roads. We started early in the morning, and we barely saw anyone until we stopped at the visitor center. Before stopping at the visitor center, we stopped at some overlooks and got some great pictures. We took a spur road up to some short hikes (Gooseneck Overlook and Sunset Overlook) which gave us some great views of the park. The drive through the park offered spectacular views of the surrounding area. The best part of the drive (in my opinion) is the gravel portion out to Capitol Gorge. I would definitely get out of the car here and walk into the gorge. It is a cool experience to be in gorge with the walls rising on either side of you. You can walk as far as you want and turn around when you get tired. Another thing we really liked were the Fremont Petroglyphs. Those were really interesting. You should certainly stop at that turnout to gaze at those. It helps if you have binoculars. Capitol Reef is a great place to go to see some amazing scenery without the crowds.

Go to the Gifford House and try one of their fresh baked mini pies. We had one every morning for the 3 days we were there. We would hike and go get a pie - the all berry one was my favorite. Staff were personable and fun. Visitor center full of awesome info. Hike EARLY - 6:30 a.m. - as after 12:00 p.m. it starts to get hot. Late afternoon hikes of the Fremount River Trail were beautiful.

Capitol Reef National Park,"For this Easterner, Capitol Reef was a national park I had never heard of. Shame on me! If you are in the central Utah canyon country, near Torrey, this park is a must place to experience. The name of the rock formation is supposedly due to the fact that it continues for many miles, seemingly like a great ocean reef. The signature rock formation is a most impressive thing to see - the big rock formation or ""reef"" just goes on and on to the horizon in its mammoth presence which blocked the east to west passage of pioneers for about one hundred miles. The ""Capitol"" in the name was given by the pioneers who thought a massive rock looked like the dome of the U.S. Capitol Building. We took the easy scenic drive going south from the Visitors' Center. It's about a ten mile drive until you come to the point where going further requires a much more hardy vehicle then what we had. Sounds like another opportunity for exploring.There is a set of cabins from Mormon pioneer days in the adjoining village of Fruita.

We only visited the core portion of the park (the visitor center and the scenic drive). The rock formations here are different and interesting. The old homesteads were also interesting to learn about the history of the area. The visitor center parking lot could be enlarged, but I assume that is it perfectly adequate during the off peak seasons. We did not have the opportunity to go on any hikes as it was close to 100 during our visit, but we did stop and check out the petroglyphs which we recommend.

No crowds and long lines, the canyon walls are so high you feel like you're in the Grand Canyon floor, and the little town of Torry has terrific curb appeal. Yes, the gas is sky high, but it is a remote area. The hike tt Hickman Bridge has to taken seriously; wear proper shoes and take water. We saw deer all over the place and they are not shy.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Wow, I'm so glad we decided to stop by this place on our way to Bryce Canyon. Lots of great views in this park. Stopped at the visitor center and gathered some information of the park. Then we drove approximately one mile south of the visitor center to Gifford's House. There are several home baked delicous pies to choose from. They also have jams, jellies for sale. Bought an apple pie to share with my spouse. We sat out front of Giffords House to eat the pie. Beautiful views all around - right next to a horse stable, barn, etc..it doesn't get better than this. Be sure to stop by this Park!","May 20, 2015",Beautiful!,141,"Tampa, Florida",5

Capitol Reef National Park,We drove through Capitol Reef National Park and wished we had planned to spend more time there. The area is lovely with lots of hiking possibilities. We visited the Fruita Campground which we can highly recommend-reservations are a must and not likely at the last minute. There is a small store at the campground with homemade cinnamon rolls and pies that are are not to be missed. There are more campgrounds along the river which looked very inviting so do some research.,"May 14, 2015",Take your time to explore this park,29,"Langley, Washington",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"I think what I loved most about Capitol Reef coming off Zion and Bryce was the lack of crowds. I think this park is under-rated in the mix. It's easy to get lost on your own and we had some amazing hikes almost to ourselves. The Washes is really cool for that slot canyon experience. It's an easy, friendly park to navigate, with all levels of trails and plenty of amazing views.I must tell readers, though, that you HAVE to go to the Gifford House before leaving Capitol Reef. Not only is it like walking into a store from Little House on the Prarie (I'm dating myself with that reference), but they have the best homemade pies, jams, and pickled items. The pies are delivered fresh every morning at 8am. They're the BEST! We loaded the car before leaving and ate them for the next week. Given that Capitol Reef has the largest orchard of any national park, you can expect the best homemade goods! If you leave without hitting the Gifford House, you've missed out! I wish they shipped those pies...","May 7, 2015",Fun and Un-Assuming,92,"San Francisco, California",4

We camped instead of getting a hotel and listening to the turkeys gobble us away in the morning was annoying yet kinda cool in the end.

Capitol Reef National Park,"It is hard to decide which is my favorite National Park in Utah. Been to all of them,and they are all different in there own scenery etc.I liked Capital Reef a lot. Not as well known.not as many people. If you want travel to some of the more remote areas you will be on some unpaved roads. I had a rental car and did not travel on the unpaved roads. This was not a negative ,there are plenty of other hiking trips without traveling on the unpaved roads.The Grand Wash trail(Dry Creek Bed) watch fantastic. Watch out for any signs of rain.

Capitol Reef National Park,"We were told not to miss Capital Reef if we were in the area. I'm so glad we took the advice we were given. While not as well known as some of the parks, Capital Reef is special in it's own way. It doesn't have the majesty of Zion, but it's still amazing. We really enjoyed our ride through the park. The trails seemed to be nice also, but we didn't hike. Capital Reef is a good park to take photos, and enjoy the many overlooks.

Capitol Reef National Park,"We were headed back to SLC to catch the redeye home after a week in Moab. Though it added about 2 hours driving time, it was well worth it. The drive itself was amazing - views of Capitol Reef on the way in, and views of snow covered mountains at sunset on the way out. The park itself was as stunning as the others. We hiked both Grand Wash and Capitol Gorge. The narrows of Grand Wash was more impressive. In Capitol Gorge, it is fascinating to think about the pioneers going through there on wagons. Both hikes had places where the walls were not as sheer straight and we could scamble up for a different view. Driving through the dirt road portion of Capitol Gorge was fun too.","April 18, 2015",Well Worth the Detour if Driving from Moab to SLC,118,Connecticut,5
Capitol Reef National Park,"We have been to Capitol Reef a number of times (including getting engaged there 27 years ago) and this time we wanted to take the back road into the north part of the park and do some photography. The drive requires high clearance, but 4WD really not necessary. The scenery in is typical desert, but is good traveling. We explored the area around Temple of the Sun and Temple of the Moon in the afternoon (takes about an hour from the highway), and then drove up to Cathedral Valley for sunset photos. We drove up the switchbacks to the Cathedral Valley Overlook and took our sunset photos of all the monuments. There's a nice free camping area with bathrooms not far from the overlook, but we drove back down to the ""Temples"". Camped just outside the park boundaries and arose early the next morning for sunrise photos. The ""temples"" have some wonderful color before the sun hits them, but the blood red/orange with the early light is incredible. We photographed from 2 different positions to get different views. Daylight color on the temples is nice, but not as satisfying as the early and late light (on Cathedral Valley).","April 15, 2015","Temple of the Sun and Moon, and Cathedral Valley have great photographic potential",152,"Grand Junction, Colorado",5

Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef..... less crowded, to be sure, but stunning in it's beauty. This is one of our National Parks that you should visit without hesitation. It is a beautiful Park with a LOT to see and do. Because it's kind of ""tucked away"", it does not draw the droves of people that other National Parks do and because of that, it seems a little more friendly as well. This is a historical area as well and we learned a lot about the early settlers that we didn't know before. If you're here during the apple, pear and peach harvest time, you can eat all the fruit you want to! Hiking is simply outstanding at Capitol Reef from easy boardwalks to challenging 2,000' elevation gain treks. Be sure and pack a lunch and take plenty of water.

Capitol Reef National Park,"If you like scenery and a variety of it, this is THEE place for you! We spent one full day driving and hiking along Rt 31(Gooseneck and Panorama Point are short hikes well worth your time) to the exit of the park and went a bit further. We also turned onto Rt. 1610 for great views. Hickman's Bridge is a must and do the loop trail. The afternoon was spent on the Scenic Drive which is breathtaking. We took all the dirt roads and had no trouble with the rental car. Did a few more hikes including out and back Grand Wash and Capital George. After an overnight in Torrey, it was up and out at sunrise for the drive down Rt 12 which is stunning. We made the left at Boulder for the Burr Trail. That drive is amazing! Its 30 miles of pavement and the drive through the canyon is stunning! Another 10 or so miles on unpaved road with switchbacks at the end that was easy to do with a regular sedan. We went down the canyon to the waterpocket fold to where the road makes a T. turned and went a few yards just to view where we came from. Stunning! And than back to Rt 12. We spent close to 3 hours on the Burr Trail alone stopping and taking pictures. This is a must do drive if you love scenery. Do not be put off by unpaved roads mentioned here. Simply ask a ranger of road conditions.","April 8, 2015",WOW!,467,"Winchester, Virginia",5

Most of the park can be seen for free by staying on highway 24. Our favorite spots were Fruita, including the baked goods at the Gifford House and Capitol Gorge. We chose to take the scenic drive and do a family hike at the south end of the park, so we paid the bargain $5 fee and enjoyed a day together in Capitol Gorge. Even though my research told me this would be the busiest time to visit, the park is huge and crowds weren't a problem except for getting a spot at the campground in Fruita.

I would like to keep this National Park a hidden gem, as it was not crowded at all, but I have to tell you this is an absolutely beautiful place.

Capitol Reef National Park,"When I drove to Capitol Reef National Park from Moab, I was a bit nervous because the landscape along Route 24 is so forbidding and so remote. My fears proved to be groundless because when I got there I found a place filled with color, thanks to the confluence of the two rivers that flow into the area.To comprehend the geological processes that lead to the incredible landscape and rock formations, spend an hour at the visitor's center and do your best. If you are a hiker, there are wonderful hikes for all abilities to be had in the park and you can do them all in a few days (minus the back country stuff). I was lucky enough to get a spot in the campground (ignore the ""campground full"" sign and drive around because often people have left before the signs have been changed.) Loop C is the prettiest spot in the campground because it is adjacent to the orchard. There is potable water, flush toilets and sinks, but no showers. Showers ($6) and 4G and phone service can be found 11 miles outside the park. Camping is $10/night.The park does not deal in any meaningful manner with early Mormon history or the ""pioneers'"" interactions with the Native Americans who were there first, or does it delve into the reason why the Mormons were fleeing from religious persecution in the first place. The Gifford House Museum in the park is more of a gift store than a museum. Having said that, it is fascinating to see the original structures and the orchards that the Mormons built and to imagine how life must have been for them.Be sure to bring a pair of binoculars to better see the many petroglyphs inscribed by the Native Americans on the towering slick-rock walls.The park was wonderfully uncrowded when I was there, and despite the lack of electricity in the campground, the generators were not troublesome at all.","March 26, 2015",Do Not Miss This Gem,96,"Wakefield, Rhode Island",5

Capitol Reef National Park,"Varied landscape, barely saw another soul while hiking through in March. A couple of the main roads were closed due to mud/ice, but that made for more hiking opportunities. The Capitol Gorge trail approach road was closed, but hiking on the road was actually more impressive than the actual trail, the crystal patterns in the ice crust over the mud were amazing (although it was a little slick) and the canyon walls contained ribbons of ""canyon varnish"", petroglyphs and signs of early travelers through the canyon. The orchards of Fruita were bare, but the tall grasses that survived the winter created wonderful framing for the landscape. The Park Rangers were very helpful and informative and the Visitor Center had a nice diorama of the landscape and the Waterpocket Fold.","March 17, 2015","Exceeded my expectations, had the park to ourselves",43,Metro Boston,5

Capitol Reef National Park,"Out of all of the national parks in Utah, Capitol Reef is probably the least visited. It is also smaller and there is only so much to do. Because of this, the crowds are practically nonexistence. I visited in August late in the afternoon, around 4pm, which is after the crowds anyway. But I saw maybe 4 ppl total while I was there. My family and I were in a bit of a rush, so we did not explore as much as we wanted. That being said...It is startling to see orchards in Utah after you become so used to desert-like landscapes and scrub. You actually see some green in this park! We did not explore the orchards, but I have heard you can go in and pick some of the fruit. We drove the Scenic drive and then headed into Capitol Gorge, which was dusty, rocky and narrow, but a lot of fun! My favorite part was as we were heading back out, the sun was setting and I just have some wonderful shots of the sun reflecting off of the rock formations. Simply beautiful. I did not expect much from this park, and I feel like I got so much out of it. It was peaceful and you could really take the time to appreciate what nature has made.I would really encourage a visit here.","January 30, 2015",Better than I expected,109,"Miami, Florida",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"CAPITOL REEF NATIONAL PARK (UTAH’S  HIDDEN BYWAYS IV)Ah, Capitol Reef National Park. It is one of the true hidden gems of the National Park system. It is also a beautiful, underutilized, un-crowded, superbly multi-colored park with many quiet corners to wander through. This park is, to any photographer, a place of joy, with its multi-colored, layer cake, rock formations and narrow washes. I have visited this park many times. I am drawn to this area as a moth to a flame. This park, for all of its beauty, is off the beaten track, thus receiving 10-20% of the traffic that a park like Zion National Park would get, which is fine to my way of thinking. The less people, the more solitude and a true experience of discovery can be attained. Since we fly in to Salt Lake City, my approach to the park is always Interstate 15 South to exit 188, across on UT SR50, and on to UT SR24 east through Torrey, Utah. We prefer to stay at the Capitol Reef Resort, which is about two miles west of the park on UT 24 and reasonably prices (reservations are needed). The view from the rear of the resort gives you a taste of the wonders to come within the park. I would recommend starting all activities within the park early, since the park can get very hot during the day. I would also recommend a hat and water, for it can very dry and sunny.  If you are staying in Torrey, Utah, proceed east on Utah SR24 to the entrance to the park. You will see the sign on your right. Pay special attention to the cliffs on your left. These cliffs, when lit by the morning light, are a joy to behold. Your first schedules stop will be the Twin Rocks, which are large boulders sitting alone. This stop is worth a few minutes of your time. As you continue east, be sure to enjoy the cliffs on your left, making any photographic stop off road (i.e. do not stop on the road). Your next true stop will be Panorama Point and the Goosenecks Overlook. This area is worth investing about an hour of your time. There is a trail that will take you out to the Goosenecks, which are eroded, entrenched dry washes. I have found that afternoon lighting is better here. Since the trail has some twists and rises, be sure that you are fit before attempting this short hike. Continuing east, you will see Chimney Rock appearing on your left. There is also a parking lot on your left for stopping, and/or attempting the Chimney Rock Loop trail. This trail is a moderate/strenuous undertaking, so be sure that you have all necessary gear needed for this hike. Furthermore, this area can get wet and slick after a rain event, so be prepared for difficult terrain. From a photographers view, the lighting on Chimney Rock is better in the mid to late afternoon. The National Park Service has provided numerous turnouts on Utah 24 for the numerous stops that you will be making. Use them, linger, and enjoy the riot of color along this stretch of road. Views of a formation called the Castle will be appearing on your left. If you go over the little bridge just before the Fruita Visitors/Ranger facility, and immediately turn off the road to your left, you will come to a small parking area. Pull off and park. Get out of your vehicle and wander through the trees down to the Fremont River. The views of the Castle and the surrounding cliffs are a sight to behold. This is a morning stop for the best lighting. A few yards down UTAH24 will get you to the visitor’s center on your right. This is also a road junction. Stop at the visitor’s center and get any information needed for your visit, including a map and sound advice about any hike. There are also restrooms here! A right turn will take you onto the scenic drive, which leads to a wealth of fantastic scenery. Fruita itself was an old Mormon settlement that was absorbed into the park many years ago. The orchard still exists, along with additional period buildings. There is also a campground located here. If one continues south on the scenic drive, one will pass the HOODOOS, which are a geographic wonder. These are best photographed, and viewed, in afternoon lighting. As you continue south, marvel at the ever changing shapes and colors of the cliffs on your left, with their layering of various hues. You will soon encounter a turnoff on your left. This leads to the GRAND WASH and CASSIDY ARCH TRAILS. I would strongly recommend this area to anyone would wants to get off the beaten track and have an adventure. I would also recommend that either of these endeavors be pursued as an early morning activity, with lots of water. It can get very warm in here, especially in mid-summer. About a mile further on the Grand wash road will bring you to a small parking area with outhouses. This is your starting point for both hikes. Cassidy Arch is visible on the upper reaches of the cliffs from near the parking area. The trailhead is marked and the uphill trail can be strenuous, so make sure that you have the proper footgear and plenty of water. The view from the top is great. We love to walk the Grand Wash. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS IF IT HAS RECENTLY RAINED OR IF STORMS ARE PENDING!!! You do not want to be caught here in the narrows during a flash flood. The trail is, essentially, the Grand Wash itself. The trail from the parking area will lead you down into the wash, wherein you will be following the course of the wash. Start early and bring water and a hat, since it can get very hot in here and parking is limited. If you have two cars, you can do a key swap if the other party starts off at the other end of the wash on UTAH SR24. The sights and grandeur of this area are immediately apparent as you make your way deeper into the Grand Wash, heading for the narrows. Take many pictures and soak in the wild beauty of the area. In addition, keep a weather eye on the sky. Enjoy every minute in the wash, for it is truly unique. It should be noted that most electronic communication devices do NOT function here. Do not depend on them in an emergency. You should be as self sufficient as possible, which includes a FIRST AID KIT.  We now return you to your vehicle. Leave the GRAND WASH parking area and proceed to the road junction. Making a left will put you on the southbound scenic drive. Please note; as you continue along this route, you will encounter low points in the road. THESE ARE DRY WASH AREAS! DO NOT STOP HERE!  Take every turnout that you can, enjoying the ever changing vistas on your left. The paved road will continue for some miles to a parking area (outhouses) and a gated, dirt road. If the gate is open and you have enough clearance on your vehicle, proceed into Capitol Gorge. This rough track terminates at a parking area containing some trailheads. About a mile before this terminus, there is a pullout and a short walking track with some fantastic views of the GOLDEN THRONE, which is best photographed in the afternoon light. At this point, you will have to double back to Fruita on the scenic drive. If you turn east at the junction with UTAH 24, you will reach the trailhead to HICKMAN BRIDGE. This is a morning, early afternoon hike. Since this is a popular hike, get here early in order to get a parking space. The hike is MODERATE with some elevation gain at the beginning. Carry enough water and have sensible footgear. You will be switch-backing up to the bridge. Take many images and stop to ponder the bridge and its formation. Continuing east out of the park will lead to another, all day, adventure. A couple of miles outside of the park, you will encounter a road (i.e. The Notom-Bullfrog Road) on your right. Be sure to have an adequate supply of water, as well as breakdown equipment, before attempting this road.  The first few miles are paved and pass through some private ranchland. A few miles further, on your left, are some outstanding rock formations worth exploring. Farther up, the road turns to dirt/gravel. DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS ROAD IF IT HAS RECENTLY RAINED! You will soon encounter a split on the main track. KEEP TO THE RIGHT! The road is now paralleling the WATERPOCKET FOLD as you re-enter Capitol Reef NP. Enjoy the many and varied colors in this area. About 20-25 miles after starting this drive at UTAH SR24, you will encounter a junction on your right which will take you up some switchbacks up to the BURR TRAIL. TAKE THIS RIGHT TURN! The switchbacks will start about 0.5 miles from the junction and will take you out of the Strike Valley. THESE ARE SERIOUS SWITCHBACK REQUIRING LOW GEAR ON THIS UP-HILL. BE CAUTIOUS AND PROCCED AT A LOW RATE OF SPEED! At the top, there will be ample opportunity to do photography and enjoy the view down. You will encounter additional viewpoints above the switchbacks for additional exploration, as well as an Arch on you right skyline. Continuing along on the main track will get you to the entrance to the GRAND STAIRCASE-ESCALANTE NATIONAL MONUMENT and the PAVED BURR TRAIL, which is discussed in detail in my review entitled “THE BURR TRAIL (UTAH’S HIDDEN BYWAYS I) in TripAdvisor. You can continue on this great road to Boulder, Utah, make a right, and traverse UTAH SR12 into and over Dixie National Forest and on to Torrey, Utah. I would like to discuss one additional area; The South Desert area. This area contains the TEMPLES OF THE SUN AND MOON, ROCK CANDY MOUNTAIN, AS WELL AS THE UPPER CATHEDRAL VALLEY. This area is worth a day trip, with an experienced guide and a proper, four wheel drive vehicles. If you have the proper vehicle, a good map and equipment (WITH WATER), and are experienced in back country driving, go for it. You must register at the Visitors’ Center before attempting this trip. I would personally advise all to obtain a local, certified guide, with a proper vehicle. Furthermore, I would make these arrangements months before my arrival in this area. Enjoy your exploration of this wonderful park. There is a lot more here that I have not discussed, HAVE A SAFE TRIP!

Capitol Reef National Park,"My wife and I went on a National Parks tour through Utah and visited Zion (our primary destination), Bryce, and Capitol Reef. We researched Zion quite a bit spent several days in Zion doing all sorts of hiking. Anyway, we didn't research anything on Capitol Reef and just stopped through it for a couple hours on our way home. We were really surprised at how many trails there are and how much there is to see. We absolutely plan to go back to the park and spend several days camping and hiking.","January 21, 2015",Way more to this park than meets the eye,23,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",5

Capitol Reef National Park,Having been to Zion and Bryce previously I decided to visit Capitol Reef on my latest visit to Utah. The park is a little off the beaten path but well worth the effort. Visited in October so the crowds were sparse but the weather and views were spectacular. The Great Wash area offered great views as well excellent hiking. Keep an eye out for mountain goats. There were several right along route 24 near Hickman Bridge on the day of our visit.,"December 10, 2014",Lesser known but beautiful.,27,Hudson,5
Capitol Reef National Park,This was a smaller park and it had some beautiful views but the lack of signage and information was disappointing.There was a self guided tour but the information was missing so you would see incredible views but no information to go along with what you were seeing.Over all it was nice and relaxing since it was post season and there were only a handful of people there that day.,"December 7, 2014",Disapointed,13,"Fairburn, Georgia",3
Capitol Reef National Park,"This park has a lot to offer. We wanted to see the Waterpocket Fold, but the road was washed out, so we drove the Scenic drive, spent time in the Fruita district (they really do have apples there), and went to Goosencks Overlook. It's a very well exposed sequence of rocks in the park, and there are some fantastic eroded slopes in grey mudstone east of the park along the Fremont River. Stop for a snack at the Gifford farmhouse, and go beyond the park to Torrey for the general store and the coffee shop.","November 21, 2014",Worth a side trip from Moab,268,"Ottawa, Canada",4
Capitol Reef National Park,The visit to Capitol Reef National Park is not complete without taking the Scenic Drive through the heart of the Park that starts at the Visitor Center . This is a 25 mile round trip that presents all of the Park's various dramatic canyons and rock formations. It is a paved road except for the last couple of miles. Don't miss these last couple of miles that have narrows twisting through Wingate Sandstone. The return trip is just as enjoyable since you see the scenery from the opposite direction.,"November 20, 2014",Scenic Drive,213,Cincinnati,5
Capitol Reef National Park,This is a beautiful park with wonderful canyon views. We only had one day in the park so we were not able to do everything that we would have liked. There were not many people in the park and we were able to get a lot of beautiful pictures. We first hiked to the Hickman Bridge. It is 2 miles round trip and beautiful. It is rated as moderate by the National Park and is considered strenuous at first and then moderate. We stopped to see the Petroglyphs by the side of the road and then took a drive down the Scenic Drive to the Capitol Gorge Trailhead. Capitol Gorge is 2.5 miles round trip that is very flat. It is considered an easy trail by the National Park. Along Capitol Gorge we saw some additional petroglyphs that were interesting. We also took a side trip up to the Tanks from Capitol Gorge. That hike was not marked very well and was a steep climb. Don’t know if I would recommend the side trip to the Tanks if you don’t want to climb over the slick rock. We enjoyed the park and recommend stopping if you have the time.,"November 19, 2014",Beautiful views and not as crowded as some of the other parks,197,"Ellisville, Missouri",4
Capitol Reef National Park,"This is a beautiful park that offers lots of gorgeous canyon views. There's actually a lot of viewpoints and a few trails that are outside of the park's entrance along highway 24. When we arrived in November, we expected to be stopped at a pay booth to get to the scenic drive; however, there were none. We noticed this at a couple of other parks, where it turns out, they expect you to park at the visitor center and pay there. The drive is winding and there were a few times I wanted to stop take photos but there were no places to park off to the side of the road. At the end of the drive is a sizeable parking lot where you're met with more majestic canyon walls. We didn't have time to do any long hikes but did have time to stop at a few viewpoints off Hwy 24.There were very few people wherever we went - it seems like this park is much less on people's radar than Arches.If you're time is very limited in Utah, I wouldn't necessarily set aside time for this park if you haven't already been to Arches and Canyonlands, but if you do have the time, it's definitely worth the trip. The drive from this park to Arches on Hwy 24 is stunning itself.","November 15, 2014",Not as crowded,198,,5
Capitol Reef National Park,"I went to this park for the first time in late Oct. 2014, to find brilliant yellow leaves on the trees, deer ambling around the grounds, and delightful backroad adventures into canyons of glory.

Uncrowded and brilliantly sunny, but chilly in the morning.","November 15, 2014",Unbelievable views at the end of Fall.,15,"Port Orange, Florida",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef has an unusual layout in that it's long and thin. There is a scenic drive that starts at the Visitor's Center and goes south, although there had been torrents of rain before our arrival so some of the roads were closed. Be aware that there are many sights to see within the borders of the Park running east to west on Highway 24, before and after the Vstr Ctr which sits just to the south of the highway. It seems strange because this is the main road that runs through the park and most parks' viewing pull outs and hiking opportunities are 'after' you pass the Vstr Ctr. There's a nice shady picnic area near the Vstr Ctr, and you might even see some grazing deer. The 'daily fresh baked pies' available at the Gifford House Store are like individual serving size, over-priced, and heavy on crust. We stayed in Torrey (west of the Park), and it's a mere 10 miles from the Vstr Ctr. Capitol Reef is located between Canyonlands and Bryce National Parks and the big allure for all of these parks is the incredible scenery you see when driving from one to the other!!","November 12, 2014",A different layout,90,FORT WALTON BEACH,4
Capitol Reef National Park,This is not one of the most visited parks but it really is spectacular and with stunning scenery. The brown and cream escarpments are different to Zion and Bryce but equally beautiful.

Capitol Reef National Park,"This National Park is a real treasure and aside from Big Bend NP in Southern Texas, the most peaceful. It is easy to find yourself on your own enjoying the stunning hikes and vistas. When we did the Cohab Canyon, we saw just 5 people on the hike and we did it as a 'there and back'. With the busier hikes such as the Hickman Bridge, expect a few more, but it is still not crowded. Even if you don't get out the car much (and I have to say that we did), I think this park would give much pleasure from just driving around this park. The views take your breath away and are incredibly varied. As you turn a corner, the rocks change and the geology is awesome. We were particularly luck in late October that we got to see the gorgeous fall colours in the valley; the trees which lined the river through the park and has carved the canyons, were just lovely. We also got to see lots of wildlife up close and personal including big horn sheep, mule deer, woodpeckers and blue jays. If you have a sturdy car or 4WD vehicle, see if you have time to do some of the Burr trail. If you are in a standard car, wait for a dry day, or do the paved road sections, which are also very worthwhile.","November 9, 2014",Stunningly beautiful and peaceful.,38,Herts UK,5
Capitol Reef National Park,"While I don't like to share out of the way locations, I have to say that Capitol Reef NP was our favorite. We loved the Grand Wash trail (too bad we didn't make it all the way) and wished we had walked to Cassidy's Look Out. That's OK though because it will give us a reason to return. Fruita, the petroglyphs and just the overall beauty made this probably one of our most favorite national parks of all time (it didn't hurt that this is a hidden gem and not very crowded). We also liked the fact that the park ranger? was a volunteer and could not be more appreciative of their time and thoughtfulness for volunteering at this park. This is a great area of southern Utah.","November 4, 2014",Our favorite.,164,"Abington, Pennsylvania",5

Capitol Reef National Park,"I think this became one of my top 3 experiences while visiting southern Utah as I had no idea of what it had to offer. Stupendous geology (and very different again from Arches or Canyonlands or Bryce), a river with water in it - ergo, orchards and greenery, great canyons to walk through, historic Mormon village, more rock art, and not overcrowded in the least. I arrived on the day when Zion NP received 9 inches of rain in a day (it get 7 inches per year) and was thus closed; Capitol Reef had its secondary roads closed in anticipation. While I thought I would have nothing to do, it did not rain at all that day, although spectacular storm clouds moved in and I got some excellent evening thundershower shots. It then poured during the night. Next day most of the roads were reopened, I and everyone else went into Capitol Gorge because we could, and had coffee and pie at the Gifford House. This park is worth so much more than a drive through.","November 1, 2014",Capitol Reef deserves our attention!,35,"Winnipeg, Canada",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"We had been here just a year and a half ago, and enjoyed it so much, we came again on our trip out west. Last time we hiked on the Northern end of the park. We thought this was amazing, but we heard the south off the Notum-Bullfrog road or the Burr Trail are even more stunning. We heard that the domes and cathedral formations are breathtaking, but the real scenery and geologic beauty come when you get to the Water Pocket Fold. Next time we plan to do that. Basically we just drove Route 24 all the way east throughout the park and up to I-70. It is a lonely, but beautiful drive.","October 31, 2014",Capitol Reef Route 24,201,"Tipp City, Ohio",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"This National Park is almost a hidden secret. Most people who visit it only see the northern end of it. The amazing parts are to the south off the Notum-Bullfrog road or the Burr Trail. The domes and cathedral formations are breathtaking, but the real scenery and geologic beauty come when you get to the Water Pocket Fold. It is important to check in at the Visitor center for current road conditions. I went down the Burr trail from Boulder, UT across the fold in a Honda Element and it was pretty easy. The MuleyTwist Canyon was a little rough but still do-able in the Element. There are no crowds in this park. In fact...in the fall expect to see only a few other cars in the entire park.

There is a historic farm and buildings left by the pioneers that tried to live and farm on this rugged land. You are able to pick friut from the orchard and buy homemade scones and pies made by a local resident. We traveled the Big 5 in Utah and Capitol Reef along with Bryce and Arches were our favorites.

Capitol Reef National Park,"We hiked Grand Wash in the morning and Cassidy Arch in the afternoon. I was more impressed with the other 4 Utah national parks but Capital Reef does have some charm. The variety of colors and banding in the rocks was very different that the other parks. The arch was not terribly after all our others in Arches and Canyonlands impressive but the hike was nice. There is quite a bit of climbing through switchbacks but the trail is well marked. Grand Wash is a nice gentile walk through a relatively narrow canyon. It is a pretty canyon and accessible from both ends. The stone seems to be relatively soft here so I would not recommend trying to climb anything. We did and I ended up with two rocks breaking off in my hands. The orchards are kinda fun. Depending on the season they are open to the public for free tasting or $1 per pound apple picking. There are a variety of fruits. The area around Capital Reef is pretty remote. We stayed at 1000 lakes RV park in a really nice cabin. When we went to the ""General Store"" for milk and bread the only options for sandwich bread were white or brown and they were both frozen and the only milk was whole. Definitely the middle of nowhere.","October 24, 2014",A nice trip for a day or two,130,"Rochester, New York, United States",4

The petroglyphs on the side of the road were incredible! We stayed in Torrey at Austin's Chuckwagon Motel - which we would highly recommend. We stayed in the newer motel rooms - and may check out their cabins next time. We also spent time outside the park on our ATVs, going up the Great Western Trail and to Velvet Ridge.

The hikes in the park are fabulous, offering all levels from very easy (and still beautiful) to quite challenging. All of the canyon hikes are great and there are many washes in the area that provide beautiful and challenging hikes.I highly recommend a trip to Capitol Reef.

The beauty of this park is dramatic, the crowds few, and the hiking wonderful. Make sure you stop (during season) in Fruita and pick some of the apples planted by Mormon settlers.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Southern Utah is awesome and jaw dropping. Capitol Reef is often an afterthought for people visiting the big four (Zion, Bryce, Arches, Canyonlands), but you will not be disappointed if you spend some time here. Outside of the fee area, there are plenty of areas to explore. The Goosenecks and panoramic view stop off of highway 12 just west of the visitor center gives an awesome view. A short walk takes you to an overview of Sulpher Creek, 800 feet below, and you see its meandering cuts through the plateau to create an amazing little canyon. A short drive along a dirt road takes you to the head of a short trail that quickly takes you to another world with amazing views and rock formations.The Hickman Bridge trail is a moderate hike off of route 12 also, that is outside the fee area. It is worth the exercise to see this amazing natural bridge.Near Hickman Bridge is a site of petroglyphs. There is a boardwalk not 20 feet from the road. This is an easy short visit and there are some quite wonderful drawings here. Definitely worth the stop.Inside the park, you can enter the orchards of Fruita and pick fruit in season. The apples were ripe when we were there, and offered a nice midday snack. The day we went, there were no attendants at the fee station and the drive down the scenic road was free. We walked up Grand Wash to where it narrows to 15 feet wide. The sheer walls extending several hundred feet up beside you are amazing. There are also many off road trails available in this park. It is definitely worth a couple of days visit. A good B&B nearby is the Skyridge Inn.","October 9, 2014",A treasure,260,"Salem, Oregon",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef National Park (CRNP) offers spectacular exposure to Utah's red rock country with a unique historical oasis serving as one of the main attractions. Utah State Road (SR) 24 is a scenic byway that provides access from either the west from Torrey or from the east from Hanksville. A quick and no-fee stop at the CRNP visitors center will provide plenty of background for the attractions available right off the highway along the Fremont River including classic pre-Columbian petroglyph sites and hiking trails into Cohab Canyon and Grand Wash or Hickman Bridge, a massive natural stone arch bridge.CRNP is over 60 miles in length but narrow, just 15 miles wide at maximum, covering a geologic feature called the Waterpocket Fold. The fold tilted the layers of rock into broad bands of cliffs starring the usual colorful formations (Moenkopi, Chinle, Wingate, Navajo and Entrada) that provide the unique scenery that makes Utah's other parks such as Zion, Canyonlands and Arches so popular. Canyons cut by the Fremont River, Sulphur Creek and ephemeral streams provide access to the heart of the fold and the water pockets or natural ""tanks"" that give the fold its name.If the traveler has time to stay and explore more than just the features along SR 24, don't miss the beautiful picnic grounds in the Fruita Historic District at the confluence of Sulphur Creek and the Fremont River. The district preserves over 3,000 fruit trees planted by pioneer families that made this area their home for over 100 years. Depending upon the time of year, cherries, peaches, pears and apples are free for sampling on site by park visitors.The campground offers 71 improved sites at $10.00 ($5.00 with senior parks card) per night under large shade trees adjacent to and within the orchards. Note that (cold only) running water and flush toilets are available in the three campground loops along with a dump station for RV's. The sites are generously proportioned with room for large motor homes and trailers. A deer herd roams the campground with impunity. The Gifford Farmhouse provides a taste of pioneer living with historic exhibits and offerings of pie and ice cream between the campground and the picnic area. The camp sites are available only on a first-come, first-served basis. The busiest month is September when just a few campsites become available each day before 10:00 AM. Additional camping and RV sites are available in commercial RV parks 11 miles to the west in Torrey and unimproved site camping is available on BLM land.Several hiking trails lead right out of the campground up the Fremont River gorge and into both Cohab Canyon and Grand Wash from the opposite side from the SR 24 access points. The original route of SR 24 through the fold has been converted into Scenic Drive leading south from the campground along the valley between Miner's Mountain (Teasdale anticline) and the fold cliffs. At 6.7 miles south of the campground the pavement ends and the wildness of the park is revealed along 2.4 miles of graded dirt road into Capitol Gorge.Capitol Gorge served as the route of the only road through the fold until the 1960's. The sheer canyon walls include both pre-Columbian petroglyphs and the writings of early pioneers who drove through the wash in wagons and later modern automobiles and trucks. The eastern part of the gorge is accessible only on foot these days but the route would still accommodate large vehicles if the roadway were maintained. Now it is a place of solitude with Navajo Sandstone cliffs that rival those in Zion NP. Don't miss a trip into Capitol Gorge if you have time to get off SR 24 even for a couple of hours.There are miles of dirt roads within and adjacent to the park to explore providing many opportunities for return trips to new features.","October 9, 2014",Capitol Reef: a gem of the National Park system in Utah,38,"Grand Junction, Colorado",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"We didn't know what to expect at this park and we were very pleasantly surprised with all that we found. It's beautiful with amazing landscape you expect to see in Utah with lots of hiking options. Beyond that, there's lots more amazing landscapes and things to see around there, in that part of Utah, that are within a semi-short drive away....like Goblin Valley and Robbers Roost. The biggest surprise was that the visitor center and part of the park is set in the Fruita Historic District. There are historic buildings and fruit orchards to pick your own apples, pears and peaches (we didn't see peaches but I think they have those). The fruit is delicious! Whatever you eat in the orchard is free and any you take out is only $1.25 per pound. There's a beautiful park that's perfect for hanging out or for a picnic. The Gifford House is a tiny historic house that's now a museum and store. They sell lots of yummy, locally made jams, jellies and more. And, they sell fresh baked pies and Scottish scones. Go early as they can sell out! They're delicious! You'll see deer roaming through the park all the time and even some wild turkeys. The campground is first come/first serve, only $10 per night and very nice. The visitor center is small but nice. We attended one of the nighttime sky talks conducted by a visiting astronomer with a telescope. It was fascinating and we learned so much! We loved visiting this park and plan to go back. Peaceful, beautiful, amazing! A side note....if you're staying a while....bring all the food you'll need as grocery options are very slim in the town of Torrey. Restaurant choices are slim too...and expensive! You will, however, have no problem finding gas. Torrey is a VERY small town.","October 8, 2014","Peaceful, Beautiful, Amazing!",41,"Menifee, California",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef is a bit out of the way but well worth the excursion into this remote part of Utah. Fans of red rock canyons will not be disappointed. The hiking trails are a bit less maintained (or paths less beaten, depending on your take) but still easily accessible. Re: Fruita visit - the pies that everyone raves about are very good indeed. The scones much less so, I thought.If you can, take an off-road vehicle. A large part of the park is accessed through unpaved roads. Most car rental companies state in their contracts you are not allowed to travel on unpaved roads. And if they have a telematics unit installed in the vehicle (tracking its location) you could end up getting charged extra for violating the terms of the contract.","October 6, 2014",Hidden gem of a park,33,"Vancouver, BC",5

We saw petroglyphs created by Native Americans hundreds of years ago, and more recent inscriptions left by early Mormon settlers & other visitors. The scenery from the road was on occasion majestic.

It is very different to the others in that it is much quieter, less touristy but equally as spectacular - more so than Zion.

They were expecting heavy rain when we were there so had just closed the gravel road at the far end but we were unsure about driving it in our rental car so that made the choice for us!!

Capitol Reef National Park,"We had a National Parks pass and did a brief drive through and walk about at Hickman Bridge and the petroglyphs.Pros: The cliffs are lovely, the petroglyphs are easily accessible and have a *free* (yay, so rare) telescope at the viewing platform to look at them better. If interested, you should take the ranger guided talk at the petroglyphs. Hickman Bridge is a wonderful and not too big hike. We went in September and there are U-pick golden delicious apples (red delicious too, but we thought the goldens were way more delicious) with a scale and honor pay system (yes, we paid, and you should too if you get apples). I got a great deal on magnets (set of 5 from all the National parks in Utah) for $10.99 at the gift shop, which is THE thing that made it worth stopping there for me, otherwise there is not a lot in the visitor's center. Cons: The main entrace visitor's center is small and not as jam-packed full of information as some of the other National Parks we visited. There are a couple of unpaved roads that had been hit by the monsoon rains. Upkeep on the educational signage is not good. We could not read the plaque at all on desert varnish because the plexiglass was so warped, bubbled and yellowed, it really was useless. The little homestead house was overpriced and they were sold out of scones by the time we got there. Each park has it's own character, and we were very glad we went through Capitol Reef. We'd go back and hike some more if we had time.","September 28, 2014",Beautiful Park...,27,"Opelika, Alabama",5

The historic district Fruita is found along the scenic drive with rural farm houses, fruit orchards where you are able to pick apples and peaches. There is a great chance to spot wildlife, we saw lots of deer. I would recommend spending at least 3 hours in the park.

We did the Hickman Bridge trail in the early evening and the Fremont River trail the next morning. Both were very enjoyable, took 2ish hours, had gorgeous views, and were a mix of easy walking and steep climbs that get your heart pumping! The apple orchards in the valley were unexpected among all the red rocks – we picked a couple apples and enjoyed walking along the cool shady areas of the valley.

At the end of these roads are some great easy walking trails.

There is plenty of wildlife to be seen along the river and you can get fresh baked pies in the Fruita section just up the road from the visitor center.It is worth stopping at the visitor center to see the orientation film and the view out the window of the auditorium is worth the drive. We saw smaller crowds and had more room to ourselves in this park. We only had half a day to spend in Capital Reef and that was OK. It would have been nice to have a little more time as a couple of the trails sounded like fun and it would have been nice to get off the road a bit.

The Waterpocket Fold is a geologic phenomenon and the Windgate Sandstone towering over you is mind boggling. There are vestiges of bygone civilizations and our own American pioneers of the 18th century. The entire canyon's human habitation history is very interesting, so ensure you sit in on a Ranger-guided lecture or hike. The Orchards, planted by Mormon settlers, continue to bear fruit and provide a lovely backdrop to a camping area. The Grand Wash deserves exploration as well. This is just a super park and managed to a high standard by the professionals of the National Park Service. We recommend you stay at the Best Western in Torrey, just outside the Park borders.

We went to the Visitor Center for great advise from the Ranger on hikes for the whole family. They pointed out several hikes to do in 1 day. Our first hikes were Gooseneck and Sunsetter in the late afternoon. The views of the Waterpocket Fold were amazing. Both hikes were about 1.5 miles roundtrip. The next morning we did the Chimney Rock hike. This was a 3.5 mile roundtrip that was of moderate intensity. The red, orange and green rock structures were beautiful. We than got some energy from pie at the Gifford House. We finished out trip with a hike of the Grand Wash. It was midday in July and we turned back after a hot 1 mile hike into the dry river bed.

The scenery is some of the best in the Southern Utah belt of National Parks, probably more so as we were not knowing what to expect! I recommend the scenic drive in the afternoon when the sun lights up the rocks with (hopefully!) brilliant blue skies behind.

Capitol Reef National Park,"We've hiked nearly all of US National Parks. And sure, some are wonderful places to hike, especially if you're backcountry hikers as are we. But, if you've not hiked the backcountry of Capitol Reef you still have the best hikes to take. For example, the Upper Muley will provide a hiking experience that should not be missed: sights, flora, isolation, geological variation, and climbing challenges (up and down). Capitol Reef is a wonderland for backcountry hiking because the park isn't crowded with visitors, it takes hikers from meadows to canyons to knife-edge cliff trails to dry washes to locations that provide unforgettable sunsets and sunrises. If you're the kind of national park visitor who stays in a car on a ride-through or visits only the Visitor's Center or stops at overlooks only, then go to Zion, Bryce, Arches and the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.

The sole scenic road did provide a pleasant view. We even drove to the end of the twisty-turny dirt road extension. Still no buzz. What about the town of Fruita: what did we miss? We skipped the Hickman Bridge trail, due to falling rock warnings at the ranger station. I have to agree with those who have suggested that this area is worthy of being a National Monument at best.

We started at the visitor center and went upstream as we did not have two vehicles to do a traverse. You can go up to the 3rd waterfall and then turn back. The first waterfall was a tricky climb up and is much easier to go down. The other two waterfalls can be bypassed to the side. Sulphur creek was beautiful and a real highlight of our vacation.

I only spent a half a day here, but it was a very memorable. I was able to see desert bighorn sheep, which according to the rangers is pretty rare. The different rock formations are amazing. Make sure that you take time to watch the film in the visitor center so you can understand the geology of the area. The orchards are pretty cool, and if you're driving through in the right season you can pick whatever's ripe at that time. The scenic driving in this park is great too.

Capitol Reef National Park,"We had an amazing drive from Moab North to Crescent Junction, west to Green River then South through the San Rafael Desert to Hanksville. However the drive from Hanksville west through the Capitol Reef National Park to Torrey was a real highlight. We drove through an incredible variety of landscapes. Route 24 wound through harsh desert moonscapes with little vegetation, red and pink banded layers in the eroded mesas and black/grey mountain ridges gleaming in the bright sunshine. The colours of the stark landscape reminded us a lot of our drive through Death Valley. We arrived in the Capitol Reef National Park in September after heavy rain so were unable to walk on many of the trails due to washouts. We did manage to see the towering white peak of Capitol Dome which dominated the landscape. There were excellent displays at the Visitors' Centre but the side roads leading off from Scenic Drive were closed due to flooding. We had a lovely lunch and coffee at the Gifford Farmhouse. We managed to take some great photos of the towering cliff face and spires of The Castle and at Chimney Rock. It's worth the drive to Panorama Point just to see the amazing view. You could clearly see the 'reef formations' on the rock faces at Panorama Point. These strange and beautiful landscapes make for a photographers' paradise.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef National Park in south/central Utah is the nation's most underrated national park. The ""Capitol"" comes from a white dome-like feature near the center of the park that adorns part of the skyline. (I'm not positive but the white rock is often navajo sandstone). The ""Reef"" comes from the 100 plus mile water-pocket fold that is that long wall that stretches across the park. ""The Reef"" was part of an inland sea that existed millions of years ago in the four corners region of the United States. As the sea receded, salt, wind, rain, and ice chipped away at the rock (much of it sandstone) until it created the spectacular scenics of the desert southwest we see today. The reef and other walls which surround the park are stunning and rich in color. My favorite hike in the park is a short one. You climb about 700 plus feet over a mile and a half to a butte. Facing you on the way up is Chimney Rock, which is twisted like a stovetop chimney. For a veteran hiker, it takes no more than a half hour. For a novice, more likely to take closer to an hour. The views atop of the butte are stunning. And you get a great sense of the vast infinite desert and cliffs that shape much of southern Utah. And you get a sense of your proportion to the real world.

Capitol Reef National Park,"In two weeks, both of us had trampled over seven national parks in Utah and Wyoming. And like good tourists, we enjoyed the wonderful views and beautiful scenery. But nothing prepared us for what was in store in Capitol Reef. We attended the Ranger's talk in front of the Visitor Center and she was pointing out to us layer upon layer of sedimentary rocks that ranged from nearly 250 million years to 100 million years. The ancient rocks that she was pointing to were just across the road! It was the most informational talk that I had attended during the trip. I was secretly wishing that there is a documentary on the same topic. What a way to start our interest in geology. Kudos also to the lady ranger (apologies for not noting down her name) who gave the short 20mins talk. She came prepared with rock and fossil samples, laminates, etc. Apparently, here in Capitol Reef, the geologic processes had exposed all the multitude of layers, like in a multi-layered cake, in one place. The place is here in the Waterpocket Fold and no where else. Highly recommended if you wish to go beyond gorgeous views. You need to see it for yourself to appreciate it.

The orchards and wild life around the visitor centre are lovely.

Capitol Reef National Park,"It depends a bit on what you like. The Capitol Reef area is best for those who don't mind a good dirt road mixed with the paved ones. What we liked about it most was the combination of formations plus the ability to get out of the big crowds like at Zion, Grand Canyon, etc., and some very good dirt roads any vehicle can handle. For some reason, some people just won't go on one, and that's fine with me (fewer vehicles). The formations are excellent; kind of a mix of 60% 'Zion-esque', 30% Sedona/Canyonlands, etc., and 10% somewhat unique to this general area. Not better than the other red rock areas, but right in there with them. You must take the Burr Trail Rd. when you are in the area to see the variety, and you can make a nice loop up part of the Notom-Bullfrog Road back to the main highway & back to the main park. There are some good side trips along the way; not taking the full loop (or more) would be a mistake if you are in the area and the weather is good. You can catch the Waterpocket area as well on this loop. Other roads might be worth it to you as well, so don't skimp on time--when are you going to get back here?

It is the middle park of the five and gets overshadowed by the others but is still amazing on its own. One day is plenty to spend here to get to see most of what it has to offer. If I had to rank all five parks here this one would probably be last but that is more of a compliment to the other parks than an insult to this one. If this park were anywhere else and more accessible drive wise then it would be much more famous.

Capitol Reef National Park,"I recently visited Capitol Reef as a long day trip on my way to Arches and Canyonlands. What a great find! Because it’s off the beaten path there wasn’t much traffic during my visit. I came in from Torrey on 24 and drove to the Visitors Center, stopping along the way at all the pullouts. There were numerous interesting rock formations and great photo opps. After the VC, I drove the scenic drive down to Capitol Gorge. The primary purpose of my day was to get a strenuous workout away from civilization. Mission accomplished! I hiked the Cassidy Arch Trail, the Golden Throne trail and biked 16 miles of the scenic drive. That made for a long but satisfying day. If you’re going to do one challenging hike at the park, do the Cassidy Arch Trail. It’s a great workout, the views along the way and particularly at the top are amazing, the Arch is better than anticipated and the solid rock around the Arch is a worthy destination of itself. Plus, I was completely alone. The Golden Throne trail was also a reasonable workout but less exciting. I thought I was going to end at the top of the Throne but merely had a view of it at the end of the trail. It was a bit anticlimactic. The scenic drive is fun and again, there are numerous photo opps. At the end of the day I exited headed east along 24 and on to Arches. I did not visit the Fruita District but understand that is interesting to many folks. In my opinion, you can cover this park in one day and be completely satisfied that you’ve seen the key elements. This is definitely worth driving off the beaten path and I highly recommend a visit.","June 29, 2014",Awesome off the beaten path experience,212,California,5
Capitol Reef National Park,"We drove through Capitol Reef National Park on Hwy 24 on our way to Lake Powell. We stayed the night in the quaint town of Torrey, Utah, which is on the Western boarder of the park. The park includes amazing and beautiful rock structures with a number of places to stop and take photos or explore the area. The highlight for us was seeing the petroglyphs -- ancient drawings on the rock walls. Driving through the park from west to east on Hwy 24 seemed more scenic than east to west, but you can't go wrong either way. Plan to spend at least an hour on the drive and for stops to check out the attractions.","June 28, 2014",A scenic drive,73,"San Clemente, CA",4
Capitol Reef National Park,"My husband and I have taken many road trips to Utah, usually in the spring when our mountain parks in Canada are still under the snow. The first time we discovered the Utah parks was when we drove north from Monument Valley and east into breathtaking rock formations of Utah. The first of the national parks we saw was Capitol Reef, and it keeps calling us back. The variety of the colours in the rock formations is mind boggling. The scenic drive through the park is lovely, even though it often rains when we are there. It is not overrun with tourists. We especially enjoy visiting the site of the old settlement of Fruita, and the preserved Gifford farm house which now sells fresh baking. Get there early in the morning for fresh cinnamon buns! Peek in the windows of the one room schoolhouse and listen to the recorded memories of one of its teachers from the 1930's. Admire the ponies in the paddock and lilac trees. Just a beautiful and peaceful place. From Capitol Reef, you can travel southwest on scenic Highway 12 over Boulder Mountain (10,000 ft elevation) and through the Escalante Staircase to Bryce Canyon. It takes a couple of hours longer than travelling the main highway, but the spectacular scenery is well worth it.","June 26, 2014",Extraordinary beauty,20,"Victoria, Canada",5
Capitol Reef National Park,A friend told us about this national park that makes you think you are on another planet. It couldn't have been said any differently. What a cool place. We detoured off of I-70 for a while to get here but it was well worth it. You can easily work your way back to 70 after a nice day trip to this park. Be sure to check out the metal dinosaurs on the north side of the road in Hanksville and the Phillips 66 carved out of a mountain as well.,"June 25, 2014",Excellent detour off of I-70 and beautiful,47,"Portland, Oregon",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"We'd been to all of Utah's other national parks . . . twice, before we even heard of Capitol Reef. It's deep into the backcountry, well off the interstate, but definitely worth the detour. Stay in Torrey, UT for the best access to the park. The town is right at the western entrance to the park. But don't expect much. There's one gas station, a general store, 2 or 3 hotels, and a few other structures. The Best Western provides an outpost of civilization in the extreme remote edge of the Utah desert. And the Rim Rock Patio serves up outstanding pizza and out back live music with the most resplendent red-rock backdrop.Capitol Reef is named that because the most prominent top layer of the rock cliffs are mostly white and rounded and one looks especially like the shape and size of the US Capitol dome in Washington DC. The domes emerge from a landscape of chipped red clay that seems more like Mars than Earth.Don't miss a chance to hike up to the ridge line - try the Rim Overlook Trail and continue on to Navajo Knobs if you can - to fully appreciate the vastness of Capitol Reef. The views from the rim are like looking down on an elaborate model train set, with roads, toy cars and patches of green speckling the red rock. It's worth the exertion to get up there - a real trip highlight!Definitely take the Scenic Drive. Mind the speed limit (15 mph in some stretches) and behold an otherworldly landscape of rare beauty. In some parts the rock-falls seem frozen in the middle of plummeting downhill. Speak too loud and a ten ton boulder will finish rolling into the valley.For a great contrast to the rim trail, hike one or more of the wash trails - like Grand Wash - to get a different perspective on the park. Just be sure there's no chance of rain before going into the wash.There's a very peaceful and approachable feel to Capitol Reef. The remnants of the mountain town of Fruita are preserved as shops and attractions. You're even invited to pick fruit from the orchard - when in season. There's more than enough trails to keep you busy for two full days of hiking, but you can fully experience the park in one day.Trip Tip: Drive from Moab to Torrey, and stop along the way for a few hours of hiking in Goblin Valley State Park. When ready to leave Capitol Reef/Torrey you can head south to Zion or St George, or Vegas, or north to Salt Lake / Park City.","June 23, 2014",An enchanting world of color - Utah's secret national park!,14,"New York City, New York",5

Capitol Reef National Park,"After being exhausted from the hiking in Arches and Canyonlands we needed a day to give our legs a break. This worked out nicely. First day started at the visitor center which gave a great layout of the area. This was the best center of the 5 parks in my opinion, they explained the Waterfold in the area along with native plants and the different rock layers. Then took the scenic drive from the center down to Capital Gorge (did not do Grand Wash as this other one seemed a bit bigger). As noted this goes into a dirt rocky road. We had rented a Mazda SUV and going slow had no problems. It was very cool and at the end we did a small walk to see the petroglyphs. Then we drove back the same way in. Next day we took the 68 mile route down Burr Trail. Another long dirt road and is rougher due to the grading of the road but nothing you could not drive. The Waterfold was very interesting. Ended up at the switchbacks up the mountain side, glad no cars coming towards us it was very narrow but cool to look back and see the route you came. You then end up in Escalante area and a very cool canyon drive that just takes your breath away. The drive back to Torrey took us thru parts of the Dixie National forest up to 9k in elevation and the aspen trees mixed with pine - just gorgeous.

Capitol Reef National Park,"This park doesn't get the publicity of other Utah National Parks but don't let that fool you. This is an amazing National Park. We stayed in St. George, UT and did a day trip to Capitol Reef. It was a bit of a long day as the commute was about 4.5 hours each way but well worth the trip. We weren't sure what to expect when we decided to go to this park. We just saw it was one we hadn't visited before and wanted to check it out. I am so glad that we did. The drive to and from the park is long although interesting enough. Once you get close to the park, the scenery totally changes and massive red rocks appear. The park is easy to drive through and rock formations are well labeled and pull offs are easily accessible. The visitor's Center is in the middle of the park and there are no entrance gates so make sure that you stop by and pick up a map of the park. The petroglyphs are really cool to see. I have been at other parks where you have to look through the viewfinders in order to kind of see a petroglyph. This park also has viewfinders but once you know where to look, you can actually see the petroglyphs with the naked eye. There are a lot of them in the area also. It's fun to take the short walk around and see how many you can locate.We made a stop in the Fruita area to eat our lunch (Subway that we had purchased just outside the park - I would highly recommend picking something up as there are not many food options once you enter the park). This was a beautiful park like setting with picnic tables. It was so awesome to sit and have a sandwich with the background of these massive red rocks in the distance. After our lunch break we continued onto ""Scenic Drive"". The views were beautiful and there are a couple of areas where you could drive right into the rocks! The first one we encountered was at Grand Wash. This is a maintained dirt road that you can take a regular vehicle onto safely. Just make sure you watch the weather because the area floods in heavy rain. I would not want to be stuck in that area in a flood! The views as you drive into and out of the Wash are amazing. The rocks loom so high over you. Each one is different. It is definitely worth the time to take the detour. At the end of the road there is a parking area (with very few spots) where you can park and take a hike even further into the rocks. We did not do the hike but still got to see some amazing sights from the parking area. The second detour is at the end of Scenic Drive and is called Capitol Gorge. This is another maintained dirt road. It is a little over 2 miles long and allows you to drive right into the gorge. It's a winding road and sometimes you will wonder if you really should keep going.......keep going! It is amazing to be that up close and personal with these wonders. There is also a trail that you can take once you get to the end of capitol gorge road. Again we didn't take the trail but were still glad that we took the driving detour!On our way back up the scenic drive we stopped at Gifford House (in the Fruita area) and got the best mixed berry crumb pies ever! There is a cute gift shop there and pastries. It's definitely worth a stop!We absolutely loved this park. It is a bit out of the way but if you like national parks and red rocks, you will be happy that you took the time to visit!","June 20, 2014","A National Park that You Can Get ""Up Close and Personal"" With",297,"Niles, Ohio",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef was spectacular, although all we did was drive through on the way from Bryce Canyon to Moab. If you are driving from Bryce to Moab, you have two driving choices, the highway (4 hours via Route 89 to I-70) or the scenic route (5 hours via Route 12 to Route 24 to I-70). If you have the time, I highly recommend the scenic route! Our day started at a hotel in Cedar City, and after a quick breakfast, we made it to Bryce by 9:30. We did the hike down into Bryce Canyon (again, spectacular), went to a few of the scenic overlooks, and were back on the road by 2:30. We had planned the day with a cutoff time; if we spent a full day at Bryce we would take the highway to Moab, otherwise the scenic route. In any case, 2:30 was within our window for the scenic route, and it was an excellent decision. Capitol Reef, and the drive along Routes 12 and 24 in general, offered some spectacular scenery. We found we made a good number of “5-minute stops” to take pictures and the drive was hugely enjoyable. With all the stops, we ended up making it to Hanksville (use google maps, it is the middle of nowhere) around dinner time and happened across a place called Dukes Slick Rock Grill, which turned out to be really good and certainly much better than expected considering there were 3 restaurants in town. Given our travel schedule, we never actually went into Capitol Reef and thus I am sure I am doing this park a huge dis-service with this review, but the views we saw just from the drive through were hugely impressive, and 100x better than anything we would have gotten taking the quicker route from Bryce to Moab.

There is a small visitors center where you can pick up a map and see an orientation film on the park,but the real attraction is the Capitol Gorge.

Get pure green vegetation next to it and you can have yourself a superb contrast of hues for which colour photography was made. This is, in my opinion, a vastly under-rated National Park. Sure, it's pleasures are not huge and obvious, but they are there: hidden, subtle and meriting careful investigation. For those prepared to make the effort, they will be amply rewarded. There are some great hikes, close encounters with mule deer, petroglyphs and a great little shop with some delicious sodas and snacks.

Lots of trails and a scenic drive that starts from the main hub of the park, the Gifford Homestead, offer fantastic views. The homestead is a little oasis of green with the orchards producing fruit and the river running nearby. Barns and trees dotted around with deep red rock walls all around make this a surreal and peaceful experience. There is a small fee for the scenic drive but it's worth it for the rock formations along the Waterpocket fold. Along UT24 you will find other areas of interest like the old schoolhouse and Panoramic point with hiking trails. [Note that Capitol Reef is on UT24 not route 12 as mentioned in an earlier review] UT24 is in itself a very scenic drive and combined with UT scenic 12 through Escalante is an outstanding drive that links Bryce canyon to Arches NP with a little run on I70 and is a far better option [if a little longer] than the route mapping programs, or your Sat Nav will send you.Do not miss if you have the time, lot's of great stuff in this area to enjoy !","February 6, 2014",Often overlooked.,254,"West Sussex, United Kingdom",5

Capitol Reef National Park,"We spent an afternoon and evening and the next day visiting this park and felt it was enough time. Rt. 12 goes right through the northern section of this park; there really is no “entrance.” or “exit.” Arriving at 3PM, we spent time at the Visitors’ Center (be sure to see the film “Watermark”) , headed back to Torrey for a bite of dinner, then headed back to Panorama Point (right off Rt. 12) to watch sundown. The skies were threatening, with rain afar, and we got some awesome pictures of rainbows. The next day we visited Frutia, a restored Mormon settlement, very near Rt. 12. Get there early to have a selection of the homemade pie. You can pick apples, on the honor-system for payment, in the orchards that are still maintained there. There is also a hike that starts there, following the Fremont River. Frutia gives you a feeling of peace; it’s very peaceful there. A short distance east of Frutia on Rt. 12 we visited the petroglyphs and the School House. We got lucky and joined a Ranger-led group and saw petroglyphs we otherwise may have missed. The Scenic Drive is a 16-mile round trip drive that goes south from Frutia and it is breathtakingly beautiful! The second night we returned to Panorama Point (we were the only ones left at nightfall, a bit spooky) to view the stars.

This was were I learned that the purple bentonite clay you see all over Utah is used as filler in Ice Cream. 15 years later I stumbled upon a group of astronomers viewing the night sky through probably 20 different telescopes. It was amazing, beautiful and educational! Capital reef has a lot to offer from casual hikes to fresh fruit from the myriad of fruit trees (in season of course). It is free to pick and eat and you pay a paltry sum to take some home with you. You can view petroglyphs and take wonderful photos throughout the park. Outside the park and if you have 4 wheel drive you can take your own tours of the slot canyons that cover the countryside here. Remember to pack lots of water as it gets hot in the summer.

We headed on 191 towards 95 and then on up to 24 and eventually hwy 12. All of it was beautiful......and so many different rock formations. I do have to warn anyone that is afraid of heights, that between Boulder and Escalante, UT..there is a portion of the road that goes over Hogsback and it is pretty narrow with drop offs on both sides.

The cotton woods were in full colar and the government shutdown had ended.As I usually do when in an unfamiliar area I researched trip Adviser for photo guides and found Redrock Adventure Guides. I do not have all that much time to spend on a learning curves and try to tap into the experiences of people who know the area that I am photographing.i was not disappointed with Jen and Steve from Redrock Adventure Guides.The first early day with Steve we drove over 50 miles on the park jeep trails covering the Cathedral Valley area.Day two was spent at Goblin Valley in the morning and afternoon exploring the Park area around the Fremont River.No Name Canyon was a special treat on the second day.Both Stev and Jen know the best areas and in the best light for photographingThe Best Western has a dinning room and a continental breakfast which I missed because of early light shooting.The town of Torrey has a general stotr and several restraints.

Capitol Reef National Park,The park is seemingly overlooked when rating our parks. We loved it in spite of limited access to its trails. We were in Capitol Reef during the government shutdown. We were allowed to drive the main roads that traverse the park because they are state roads. We could not hike any trails or visit points of interest because they were physically blocked by an obstruction or armed park ranger. The park is spectacular. Driving the Burr Trail or the route thru Cathedral Valley was breathtaking. We visit the southwest on a regular basis-Capitol Reef and the nearby town of Torrey a must .

Capitol Reef National Park,"My travel partner and I agreed that we were glad we went to Capitol Reef AFTER Zion and Bryce, because they would have seemed pale in comparison. The half day we spent at Capitol Reef was the best of the 10 days we spent visiting the National Parks in Southern Utah. Be sure to take the scenic drive south from the visitor center all the way to the end (Grand Valley Wash), then walk down to see the petroglyphs. There are other trails from that parking lot, plus wheelchair accessible bathrooms. There are other scenic drives you can take in the park, and hikes such as Hickman Bridge Trail.Be prepared to use up your quotas of ""wow,"" ""amazing,"" ""awesome"" and ""oh my"" on the drive, and stop at all the turnouts to marvel at the beauty (and take pictures!) Capitol Reef is a little known scenic treasure, and thus less crowded than some of the 'big name' parks.Tip to those 62 or older: you can buy a lifetime senior pass for $10 at the Visitor Center that will get you into ALL the national parks as many times as you wish. There is a free pass for disabled citizens, as well. Carry water, wear good hiking shoes or boots, and a hat, plus sunscreen. Hiking poles are very handy for the sometimes steep and rocky trails.","October 24, 2013",The most beautiful of all the National Parks in Utah,178,"Berkeley, California",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"While the key attraction at Capitol Reef and the reason this area was set aside as a national park is the beautiful geology, this park also offers many other reasons to visit including Fremont Indian petroglyphs, pioneer history, preserved remains of a Mormon frontier town with pick-your-own orchards, Wild-West history, such as a Butch Cassidy hideout, and backcountry adventures. Much of this is accessible along Rt 24 at no cost but even the scenic drive and access to some of the better hikes is only $5. Capitol Reef is named for geology; Capitol for the sandstone domes that look like a capitol dome and Reef for the fold in the Earth known as a monocline, named the Waterpocket Fold, which was a barrier to travel like a reef at sea. The Waterpocket Fold got its name for the pockets eroded in the monocline fold that hold water year round. Highlights of the visit for us were the scenic drive and the Notom-Bullfrog road which provided different perspectives of the Waterpocket Fold; our two favorite hikes, the Cassidy Arch trail and Capitol Gorge trail; the remains of Fruita with the flowering orchards during our spring visit and the Gifford Homestead with the wonderful homemade fruit pies; and, for the kids, the Junior Geology badge. If one has a high clearance 4x4 vehicle, one can visit the backcountry Cathedral Valley section with its famous monoliths and true solitude. This often overlooked national park is very worthwhile for visits of half a day to several days depending upon one’s time and interests.","October 21, 2013",More than Geological Wonders,3757,"Avon, Ohio",5

Capitol Reef National Park,"Having not ever heard of Capitol Reef NP before our recent trip, I have to agree with the many fans who have reviewed it. We had incredibly good luck in that we arrived on the first sunny, rain-free day they'd had in a long time. Besides the amazing rock formations and long, beautiful vistas, there is the opportunity to pick fruit at Fruita (apples and pears in mid--September), free to eat there or $1/lb to take with you. We also hiked along the river and then as far up the side of a cliff as we felt comfortable. The day was warm, but as we gained elevation, there was a strong, cool breeze. There were a few other people hiking, and a fair amount of traffic along the scenic route, but it never seemed crowded, and you could tell from the way the other travelers were soaking in the beauty that they were as charmed by this park as we were. We also stopped to see the petroglyphs, and drove far enough along the drive past Capitol Dome to see a tiny historic cabin. If you want a great overlook for an amazing view of this area, there are some not to be missed along Utah Highway 12. We arrived in the area via this road after dark, but backtracked to see the overlooks after exploring Capitol Reef. Definitely worth the twenty-minute back track, which was much faster when not dodging cows on the road in the dark! Reading some of the other reviews, there were enough things we missed that I would definitely return to this park again, and hope for another stroke of luck weather wise!","October 11, 2013",Beautiful Park,6,"Strafford, New Hampshire",5

Capitol Reef National Park,"We then headed NW on HW 95 toward Hanksville and found this part of our trip so far was the MOST picturesque we have seen. As you drive in this area of HW 95 as it is like driving at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, rather then around its rim. There is no way we can describe what we observed, but would suspect a lot of people may bypass this area in favor of taking the shortcut roads to the major locations like Arches / Canyonland / Bryce / Zion. We found very little traffic on HW 95 as compared to what we have seen on HW 89 & 191. We observed a number of motorcycles, but we wonder how they can observe the beauty of these surroundings without taking their eyes off the windy road (it is hard enough for someone driving a 4 wheel car to take a peak here or there). We stopped at Hanksville for a 2 pm lunch at Blondie’s (not much else in Hanksville). We asked the locals when the peak period was for tourist and they noted summer and especially during Labor Day, with the outside temp running between 100 & 110 F.We turned west on HW 24 towards Capitol Reef Nation Park. Along this path the skies opened and we witnessed first hand what flash flooding looks like. Those towering rocks are solid and the water ran off of them like a cow P---ing on a flat rock. The water ran off the hills like a thousand waterfalls and the streams along side the road erupted with fast flowing water. As we approached one of the campgrounds, we observed tents floating down the washes and cars with water up to there door frames. We stopped and talked to one of the campers (guy form Holland). As it started raining on their hike, they headed back to the campground and he just got his car across the driveway out of the campground before the road washed out. His buddy was on the other side of the driveway, trying to figure out how he was going to get across the washout!! He noted that many of the people in the camp were still out hiking when the storm hit. We have some dramatic pictures of the rushing water and tents floating in them!!As we pulled into Capital Reef on HW 24, we noticed that most of the park is along this road and unbelievably beautiful especially when you consider the heart of the park is the fertile Fruit growing area where homesteaders have been growing fruit trees for over 100 years. The skies really opened up at we entered the visitor’s center so we spent about 15 minutes watching a video on the parks history. By the time we were ready to move on they announced that the scenic drive (dead end) road was closed because of mud wash outs over the road. With that bad news we drove on to Richfield for tonight’s accommodations at the (4 hinge) Fairfield inn & suits (another one of those free nights). Prior to reaching Richfield the countryside really started to change with a greener environment that supported large flat cattle ranches.We went 235 miles today and have gone over 1,400 miles so far on this trip.","September 24, 2013",Capital Reef - SO SO,362,"Two Rivers, Wisconsin",3

Capitol Reef National Park,"I've been to Capitol Reef 20 years ago and always wanted to go back since on that first trip we hadn't planned in much time. This time the weather partly defeated us as the Notom - Bullfrog road was closed due to washouts as was the first of the gorges you can drive / walk down. We started walking down Capitol Gorge but then the rest of my party chickened out when they heard a distant thunderstorm - probably wise although I think there were no local effects. Capitol Gorge is fantastic - was a bit spoiled by a large party of very noisy Chinese tourists driving in a fleet of Chevvy Suburbans. Dear fellow tourists - the acoustics in Capitol Reef are indeed great ... but what makes it truly special is to soak up the solitude and it is amazing how the canyon walls swallow (other) noise - when they had gone it was one of the quietest places I have ever been.The west side of the park - where the scenic drive is - is definitely the best bit. We did drive some way down the Notom - Bullfrog road but the fold is a bit boring on that side.

We had a lot of rain during our visit and the rocks and cliffs and vistas and ground are a beautiful deep, dark red when wet. Stunning views. We drove to the end of the scenic drive, then along 2 miles of dirt road, then hiked back thru Capitol Gorge to see the Pioneer Register, an area of the narrows where the early settlers carved their names into the rocks when passing through......historical graffiti! Note to self, don't hike this area when there is danger of rain! It started drizzling and we were pretty soaked by the time we got back to the car.....then had to traverse 2 miles of dirt roadRIVER to get back to asphalt road! No worries, we made it, but as we exited the dirt road, a Park Ranger was closing it off because of danger of flash floods. There isn't a great deal of the park that is accessible by vehicle, just route UT-24 through the park, and a 10 mile scenic drive past the orchards of Fruita, an early LDS settlement. Supremely beautiful area, with wonderful campgrounds and hiking trails. Don't miss the pies at the Gifford House, and stop by the Visitor Center for weather conditions before hiking. Lots of deer in the park, and we even saw a yellow bellied marmot out in a grassy area. You can pick fruit from the trees and enjoy it in the orchards (see the signs for what's available), and there's an honor system for purchasing fruit by the bag to take out of the park.All in all, a beautiful visit and I think we'll be back in the future!","September 3, 2013","Absolutely beautiful, remote",123,,5

There isn't one! We got to the Visitor Center and I asked a ranger why no entry gate. He said that because state highway 89 passes through the park and people use it everyday to pass through, they can't charge. There is a charge for the scenic route which is not along Hwy 89; however, there was no charge during our visit because one of the turnoff roads was closed.There is a focus on Mormon history in the park with the Fruita orchards and some buildings. You get a little glimpse of the native people before them via the petroglyphs. You can probably get a good visit of the park in one day. We had just a few hours and didn't get to see the water pocket fold for which I believe this park is most known. We did drive the scenic drive, hiked the Grand Wash Trail (see that review), and saw the petroglyphs. Unfortunately the Hickman Bridge was out.If you visit, make sure to stop at pullouts for Chimney Rock and The Castle for some photo ops.

Instead, we encountered a beautiful park without any crowds and rich with history. Unlike the majority of our other national parks, this one was inhabited until fairly recently. Therefore, you have some settlement homes, farms, orchards and even an old one room schoolhouse which was used up until the 1940's, I believe. Incorporate that with the natural land formations and ruggedness of the landscape and you have one fantastic experience! Make sure to drive around the park, take a look at the petroglyphs along the way, visit the old schoolhouse and old homes, perhaps pick some fruit in the old orchards, take a hike or two and simply savor this gem of a park.To think that we didn't expect much after visiting the larger and more ""famous"" parks in the area.

Capitol Reef National Park,"In most parts of the country this national park would be a star attraction. In Utah it is just one of several national parks and I don't think it gets the attention it deserves (at least I didn't give it the amount of attention in my research and planning).This is a beautiful park with a lot of interesting settlement history. Approaching from the East (from Moab) was a beautiful drive. We didn't have a lot of time and the trail we thought we might explore was closed due to flooding (Capitol Gorge), so we just decided to relax in their lovely picnic area along the river which was cool, shady (and very welcome after our morning of very hot hiking near Moab), and had beautiful views. We relaxed, ate, watched the deer and other wildlife, and splashed around in the Fremont River. It is amazing to find a lush, cool oasis in the very arid lands of Capitol Reef. After lunch we enjoyed the scenic drive, but somehow I missed my note to myself about the petroglyphs right along US 24 so we missed them. Darn it.We did stop at Panorama Point on the way out of the park and it was a gorgeous spot for photos. The clear air allows views of a hundred or more miles which is something we never experience in the Midwest. I was amazed how far I could see with my binoculars. We watched a storm roll in and it was fascinating to track its approach. This park deserves more than a quick pass-through.

Awesome parks to picnic in and cool off from hiking. - these parks are well maintained and near the main campground. We found them very peaceful and quiet and watched many deer stroll by our picnic.2. Helpful staff at Visitors Center - When we needed help finding trails or even with some small messy emergencies with my kids the staff at the visitors center were of great help. Wonderful volunteers too!3. Well marked trails and historical significance  - we loved the trails and the off trail exploring that we did with our little ones.

Capitol Reef National Park,The park has a short drive that you can take with many interesting rock formations along the way. There is a nice hike at the very end of the dirt road that extends beyond the paved trail. I would not recommend a large vehicle to get back to it as the road is narrow. This was a very nice park that very few people have heard of. It was not busy but did have a steady crowd. We were able to see deer and turkeys while there.,"June 27, 2013",I wasn't sure what to expect- but very nice,152,indianapolis,4

The visitor center was crowded and busy when we arrived in the mid-late afternoon, but the park is very large and once you leave the visitor center it no longer seems crowded. The weather was quite warm - about 10 degrees above normal for this time of year, but as long as you bring enough water on your hikes it's great. We were able to hike twice here. We hiked the Cohab Canyon trail, and the Fremont River trail. Once you gain a little elevation, it's like you can see forever. There were a couple of hikes that we didn't have time for, and we didn't know until we talked with a ranger that the Hickman Bridge trail was closed due to a rock slide, but we had a wonderful time. Take the scenic drive to the end of the road. It is very pretty to see, and gives you a chance to relax and look at the scenery. The park is very quiet in the early morning, so if you are looking for solitude, you will definitely find it here.","June 16, 2013",Amazing Place to Hike,52,"San Diego, California",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"There are no lodging or food options in Capitol Reef. A good option is to eat and/or stay in the town of Torrey which is only a short drive away from the entrance to the park. There is a Howard Johnson and Best Western as well as several other lodging options. A good place for breakfast or lunch in town is the Canyon Reef Inn and Cafe. Driving into the park from Torrey, we saw the Chimney Rock formation. We then turned off the road a short way to view Panorama Point. Returning to the main road, we saw The Castle. There is a view area on the right side of the road. Entering the park, we stopped at the visitor center to see the exhibits, view the movie, and get a map, etc. We took the scenic drive stopping to view elements of the pioneer town of Fruita: the orchard where peaches, apples, cherries, apricots, and pears were grown; the blacksmith shop, the one room schoolhouse, and the Gifford Homestead (1908). We stopped at various pullouts and viewpoints along the paved portion of the scenic drive and then returned to the visitor center to turn right and exit the park via west route 24, stopping to view the Fruita school, petroglyphs, and Capitol Dome. The rocks were just as red as Zion and Bryce, the scenery breath-taking, and the park was much less crowded. The rocks change color throughout the day. There are some easy and difficult hikes available in the park. However, most of the access to the easier trails and some of the moderate to difficult trails requires some driving on gravel roads.","June 16, 2013",An under valued national park with less traffic.,65,Philadelphia,5
Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef is part of a 100 mile area that was created some 65 million years ago when dinosaurs roamed the landscape. The ""Waterpocket Fold"" defines the landscape with it's bulging uplifts, rainbow-hued sandstone reefs and canyons. Entrance to the park is free. There is a visitor's center which is open 8-4:30 and has geology, natural science abd cultural displays. A short orientation video is also given. As with all National Parks, Rangers will assist you in planning an itinerary for the duration of your stay. The highlights of Capitol Reef are the Fremont petroglyphs, the Mormon Homestead, the school house, blacksmith shop, Ripple Rock Nature Center. the Fruita (orchard) and the 16 mile Scenic Drive and backcountry. There are two dirt roads off the Scenic Drive which take you to Cathedral Valley where you walk between vertical cliffs. The Scenic Drive ends in a loop where you turn-around and head back to the visitor's center. The Scenic Drive costs $15 dollars but is free with a Senior Lifetime Pass or other National Park Pass. The Fruita grows apple, peach, cherry, pear, and apricots. Pies and other baked goods are available during the harvest season. Eat what you like for free. If you want to pick and take home there is a minimal fee. They have historic and heirloom varieties. Off of Scenic Highway 24 westbound and about a 1/2 mile from the visitor's center you will find the old school house and Fremont (700 AD-1250 AD) petroglyphs.

I am so glad I took the time to visit this beautiful and uncrowded park. My travel companions and I started with the Cohab Canyon Trail which is just beyond the Fruita District. Great trail which has slot canyons and a ""detour"" to two lookout points. The second day, we did Capitol George trail with a side trip to The Tanks. The park has a wonderful Visitor Center with Ranger lectures and lots of great information. Make sure you stop there. The scenic drive is fairly short and well worth the 5 bucks. At the end of the paved road, you can continue on the well groomed dirt road to the trail head parking area. Best to get there early as the lot fills quickly. Drive carefully as it narrows in places and only one car can get through at a time.We loved our time at Capitol Reef.

Capitol Reef National Park,"In the middle of May, 2013 I traveled to Torrey, Utah outside of Capitol Reef National Park for an intensive 5 day photo workshop hosted by professional photographer James Kay. I last passed through Capitol Reef in 2007. Sadly the weather did not permit me to stay but this time the weather was gorgeous and i was focused on many out of the way locations, some of which required a good deal of hiking. All of these locations are accessible within the park and with good weather each one is astoundingly beautiful. In order to catch the good light at sunrise and sunset, one must get up early and stay out late. In between there is a beautiful park setting near the visitor center and if you are camping, there is a big beautiful campground which can be used as a base of operation. The Burr trail heads east out of the town of Boulder and can be easily traveled by most vehicles in good weather. It leads into the southern end of the park with a majestic overlook view of the Strike Valley. The geology is both twisted and beautiful. Hikes into Pleasant Canyon and Cohab Canyon are moderately strenuous but well worth the effort. Bentonite Hills south of the visitors center are beautifully colored layers of gray, purple and white. On the final day of the workshop we traveled into Cathedral Valley on a fairly rough road to view some famous sandstone pinnacles known as the Temple of the Sun and Temple of the Moon. The nearly 60 mile circular trip consumed most of the day and is worth every minute. The images that I captured in my camera and in my mind will not soon be forgotten. Capitol Reef is truly a uniquely beautiful location.","May 28, 2013",Capitol Reef Photo Adventure,29,"Orange, California",5

The house sells freshly bakes bread, small 2-person pies, ice cream/sorbet as well as souvenirs. After our drive, we stopped along Fremont River and had our lunch by the bridge and listened to kids having a wonderful time playing in the river.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef National Park is about 8 miles from Torrey, UT on hyw 24. If you are at Bryce Canyon, or somewhere on Scenic Hwy 12, get up early, drive along Route 12 , dont stop anywhere to take pics or you will NEVER get there! We did just that, we stayed at Bryce and explored Scenic route 12 starting with Capitol Reef National Park 121 miles away.It is a stunning park!. The minute you turn on to HWY 24 you start seeing beautiful rock formations. The road to the park entrance and visitor center is super scenic. Pull over when ever you can and take pictures.There were not as many people as there were at Bryce @ Capitol Reef. Most of the people I saw were like me, people who had driven there and had a limited amount of time so just did the scenic drive. From the visitor center there is a 25 mile round trip scenic drive, and it truly is scenic! The layers of sediments are amazing! it is called Capitol Reef because the white domes resemble the United States Capitol building and the word reef accounts for its impenetrability as the attached pictures will show. I really like rocks and it thrilled me to bits that so many sedimentary strata were visible.If you are a photographer... be there early.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Spent 3 nights in the Fruita campground which is pretty large and very improved - that is to say paved. There are 3 loops and all loops are close to fruit orchards and a trail that can be taken to reach the Gifford Homestead. There are plenty of RV sites and some will accomodate the large Class A rigs. We were very surprised that there was no entrance fee to the park (there is a fee to camp). A stop at the visitor center was completely worthwhile. We saw a very interesting and informative video presentation in the theater after which a curtain above the screen was opened revealing a jaw dropping formation. We quickly got the idea though that if you want to see the best of Capitol Reef you need to hike it. There are wonderful trails you can pick up right at the campground. We hiked the Fremont River Gorge Overlook Trail, the Fremont River Trail heading away from the Gifford homestead area, and the Cohab Canyon trail across the street from the campground. All are reasonably challenging but oh so worth the effort. That's the thing: the best stuff is hidden from view if you just drive around on the road, even the scenic drive. Hike it!

Capitol Reef National Park,"This was our 3rd visit to Capitol Reef. It was beautiful as always, and the best part is still the lack of crowds. The beautiful red, yellow, pink, white and multi-colored cliffs of the Waterpocket Fold surround you everywhere you go. There is a new spectacular view around every corner. It is truly photographer's paradise. Our stay was short, and I was sick with a 24 hour flu the day we planned to visit several backcountry sites, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it!Most of the park is backcountry. Some areas are accessible via dirt roads, which are often impassible, especially when wet, and some areas are only accessible by hiking. However, if you aren't interested in or don't have time for any of that, at least take the 30 mile drive from Torrey, Utah to Caineville, Utah on well maintained paved State Route 24, through the historical town of Fruita, where the Capitol Reef NP Visitor Center is located. That has to be one of the most beautiful short drives in the US.There is also a paved road that turns south off of SR 24 at the Visitor Center in Fruita, which meanders 8 miles to the end of the pavement. This road, aptly named Scenic Drive, also offers constant beautiful scenery, and it is an easy drive. A small fee is requested for Scenic Drive at an honor station. No other areas of the park charge a fee. You might notice a white sandstone conical shaped formation off to east of Scenic Drive as you drive south 3 or 4 miles south of the visitor center. The formation is named Fern's Nipple, and is a 7065 foot high sandstone peak that was purportedly named by Butch Cassidy after one of his girlfriend Fern's better attributes. I can attest that it will make for great family conversation in the car as you drive along.... At the end of Scenic Drive, a well maintained dirt road takes you 2 more miles into Capitol Gorge.

Capitol Reef National Park,"We went to the five national parks of Utah and hands down, Capitol Reef National Park had the least amount of visitors. This was probably because people were not as familiar with it as Zion, Bryce, and Arches NP. Except for the visitor center and Fruita campground, there were hardly any crowd in the different sections of the park that we visited. After an overnight stay in Torrey, we headed to Capitol Reef and checked out the visitor center for information and souvenirs. We listened to a very interesting and highly informative talk by a ranger regarding the geology of the park. We then proceeded to the Historic Gifford farmhouse and saw the restored dwelling of a typical Utah rural family. We bought some pies and ice cream that were on sale.The approximately 10-mile Scenic Drive was the highlight of our visit. We did not have the time to do any long hike, but we made sure to stop at many places along the route to take pictures and climb up the unique rock formations. The views along the road and up in rocks were fantastic. We felt that we owned the place since there were only a few cars on the road. In fact, It was also the only park that we did not stop at a ranger entrance station to show our annual pass. There was a nice picnic ground dotted with trees near the Gifford farmhouse with tables and benches . We had a relaxing late lunch there before heading out of the park. We also stopped by a boardwalk where we saw petroglyphs created by the Fremont people.If you are looking for some peace and quiet in a dramatic landscape, with no maddening crowds to disturb you, then Capitol Reef NP is just the place to visit.","April 29, 2013",Least crowded park we visited,171,Manila,5
Capitol Reef National Park,"You can get a feel of what the park is like via the drive there. Upon arrival in what seems to be the center of the park, there is a small visitor's center and an average movie is available for viewing. The helpful ranger encouraged us to go on the Wabash Trail so our kids could run rampid. Unlike most areas of Nat'l Parks, the trail has no protected vegetation and kids can climb rocks and make like Indiana Jones, as the terrain resembles a location for an action movie. We only saw a few others in passing and the echos of our voices added to the aura. To get to the trail, one must drive (or bike) a few minutes on a dirt road which made a dusty mess of our rental but no damage was done. The is a complete change of the terrain in parts of the park as orchards dot green lawns. A picnic on the greenery between the visitor's center and Gifford Farm House was another highlight.

Several hikes required car shuttles. We had colder weather than expected, and there was some snow on the trail one day, but we were able to hike all of our planned hikes each day. We also enjoyed the excellent food at some of the most unexpected restaurants in Boulder and Torrey, along with fruit pies at the Gifford Farmhouse. The terrain is beautiful, although I would like to return in the fall when the trees are turning.

We hiked the trail through the canyon at the end of the nearby Scenic Road (entry is on the honor system) and hiked to the petroglyphs and tanks - large ponds of water in basins etched into the rocks - in a desert!

My wife, son and I recently visited and all of us had a terrific time. The Park is quite large and only a small part of it is accessible via the main road, Utah 24, that cuts through East - West by the Visitor Center. The activities here center around Scenic Drive; you can easily spend several days on this 10 mile stretch of paved road. There's a good dirt road (fine for even low-clearance passenger cars) off of Scenic Drive to Grand Wash.

Capitol Reef National Park,"When I was in Arches National Park, there were so many visitors that parking was a problem. I was quite annoyed by it. I arrived at Capitol Reef the day after, on April 13th, I drove for miles on the beautiful scenic drive and I didn’t encounter anyone, not a soul. I couldn’t believe it. It was really spooky.The day was overcast and a bit showery. That may account for the absence of visitors. I hope so because this park is definitely worth a visit. The rocks here are a feast for the eye, looking more like rock candy than sandstone. They’re as majestic and striking as anything I’ve seen in other parks. I emailed a video to my brother and he thought a portion of the Reef looked like Emerald City. This fantastic, candy-colored park can really spark the imagination. The scenic drive in Capitol Reef National Park is 10 miles of paved road with access to trailheads and unpaved spur roads. One unpaved road leads to the Capitol Gorge, which is subject to flash flooding when it rains. It was overcast and rain was likely, so I chose not to drive into the Gorge. Mormon settlers cultivated a fruit orchard near the Capitol Reef in the 1800s, which is now known as Fruita. The name was inspired by acres of cherry, apricot, apple, peach and pear trees in the orchard. Fruita is worth touring along with the Park and don’t miss the one-room schoolhouse built in 1896. It’s on highway 24 just before the entrance to the Visitors Center.","January 10, 2013",Beautiful but Desolate,203,"Alexandria, Virginia",4
Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef sits somewhere between Arches/Canyonland and Zion/Bryce, so it you plan to visit them all, this is the mid point stop. We were surprised there is no charge to visitor unless you take the scenic drive, so you can stop at various viewpoints for free. The ranger at the visitor center recommended that we take the scenic drive and head for Capitol Gorge in our car even though it was not 4WD. It was a small dirt road deep into the canyon with spectacular views above (lucky for us to have a big sunroof).","January 7, 2013",Another wonderful National Park,66,"Beaumont, Texas",5

Capitol Reef National Park,"A friend tipped us off about Capitol Reef, which I had never heard of. You always hear about Bryce and Zion, but this is a hidden treasure. The rock formations were incredible -- and so varied! The map they give you at the entrance highlighted the scenic spots which are easy to see from the road and scenic turnouts. We began exploring the Grand Wash area -- which I would highly recommend. It was an unpaved road and we turned around after the Cassidy Arch due to time constraints and uncertainty about the unpaved road. This area -- as well as Highway 12 in general -- is a must-see when driving between Bryce and Arches. If you don't hike, you can see the whole scenic drive without investing too much time (if time is a constraint).","November 20, 2012",Scenic Out-of-the-Way National Park with Amazing Rock Formations,51,California,5

The scenery is spectacular, especially the drive in from Cainville, and the scenic drive in the park which can be navigated by most any vehicle.

It was a good day to see the backcountry that is visited by very few tourists compared to those areas accessible by paved road.Be prepared for a long day. We were told the tour would be from 9 am to 3 pm, but we didn't return until after 5 pm. We were there in mid-October so we didn't have the heat of the summer, but by afternoon it was plenty hot.

Capitol Reef National Park,"We enjoyed visiting this park on our recent trip to Utah. One thing we liked about it is that there is a little more to do than just hike and view scenery - there are some early Mormon farming settlement buildings that are interesting to see. One thing we did not like about the park is that to see alot of the more impressive sights you need to be able to handle some pretty long and moderate to strenuous hikes. As I am on the other side of 60, and am used to land of less elevation, I just wasn't up to that. If you are younger and more fit, this could be the park of your dreams.

Capitol Reef National Park,"As other reviews suggest this is the quiet side of Utah's national parks. What it lacks in people it makes up for in sights and stuff to do though. Get your self a decent 4x4 before you get here to appreciate the best bits - which usually involve a several mile drive on a dusty road. If you are just passing through check out the visitor centre for tips, but be sure to visit the old farmhouses and buildings dotted around - check out the homemade cakes and 'traditional' sodas at the homestead. There are petroglyphs just off the roadside and a couple of easy access shorter hiking routes. If you have more time check out the hike to Cassidy Arch, hike right through Grand Wash and drive out to Capitol Gorge (visit the Pioneer's Wall for old-time graffiti, and hike up to The Tanks which are pretty). The Scenic Drive to the latter is excellent. Whilst we didn't have time there appear to be loads of backcountry or slot-canyon opportunities off the Notom Bullfrog Road which if you have the right vehicle can be followed on a loop (most of it was washed out when we went - so check with the Rangers before you set out). You will almost certainly find someplace where you can be alone - enjoy.","October 9, 2012",The road less travelled,92,"Kirkby Lonsdale, United Kingdom",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"Zion Nat'l Park gets three million visitors a year. Capitol Reef gets, if their lucky, 300,000. It's a very under-appreciated park. How anyone could give this park anything less than an very good rating, I don't know. We've been here at least 15 times and always find or learn something new. You don't want to just ""drive thru"", you need to spend at least one night in one of the surrounding, great B&B's, or camp in the park or on Boulder Mountain.There is more hiking to do here than you can shake a stick at. As a family, we enjoyed hiking to Chimney Rock and also doing an interpretive ranger tour through Shinob Canyon. Cassidy Arch is also well worth the hike. We're really looking forward to hiking the Goosenecks.For a quick stop you'll need to make sure you get to Sunset Point (overlooking the goosenecks) and take a hike to Hickman Bridge, a huge natural bridge toward the east side of the park. If you have a day, I highly recommend driving through the park, then south on the Notom Road to The Burr Trail, into Boulder for lunch at The Burr Trail Grill, then back over Boulder Mountain for dinner at Cafe Diablo. This is the best red-rock/rugged country scenery you will see in the country. The Burr Trail is drivable with my Honda Civic, just be sure to take extra water and check with the the park office in Fruita to see if there have been recent storms that might make the road impassable. September and April/May are the best times to visit as this desert country is much cooler then.

Capitol Reef National Park,"I have to admit that we had never heard of Capitol Reef until we decided to spend a month exploring SW Utah. Although all of the Utah national parks relate to the geology of the Colorado Plateau, each one has been preserved because it is different. Capitol Reef is newer (1971) than its national park siblings in the state and, by comparison, suffers from the fact that it is huge and doesn't have as many well marked vistas that you can drive to and take a picture at. Not that it doesn't have absolutely stunning views, but they aren't the great amphitheaters of Bryce or the temples of Zion. The majesty of Capitol Reef is the fact that it is literally a hundred miles long! Some tour guides mention that it is better appreciated from the air than at ground level. Although many people probably just stop at the visitor center and then continue across the park on Route 24, you won't appreciate the geology nearly as much unless you drive on at least a portion of the scenic drive. It's only from the drive that you can truly see the extent of the cliffs that are the primary feature of the park. If time is limited you don't have to drive the entire distance; it's only a $5 fee so it's not a big expense even for a shorter drive. When you do drive across on Rt24 be sure to stop at the petroglyphs; they are the easiest to get to ones we've found anywhere in the SW.","September 14, 2012",A hidden gem among Utah's stunning national parks,359,"Madison, South Dakota",5

Capitol Reef National Park,"My wife and I visited Capitol Reef National Park over the Labor Day weekend. We were accompanied by some friends of ours. It had been quite awhile since we had been to Capitol Reef and we had almost forgotten how beautiful this National Park is. The geological and rock formations are simply amazing. There are countless viewing, hiking and photo opportunities throughout the park. Our friends had never been here before and were somewhat awe struck at the natural beauty of Capitol Reef. The sheer cliffs, natural monuments and panoramic vistas are something to behold. Capitol Reef is a litlle off the beaten path which results in the park not being nearly as crowded as the other National Parks in Utah's Grand Circle which is a big plus as far as we are concerned. You are constantly surrounded by the rugged and natural beauty while touring this park. The area around the park is also very picturesque and really reminds you of the ""old west"" we remember in lot of the western films we grew up with.

Capitol Reef National Park,"My wife & I were part of a family group of 8 adults touring national parks for a week in early August (HOT!). We changed hotels daily & drove 1200+ miles during the week..... Lots of astonishing canyons, valleys, & rocks! Did I say it was HOT?! We visited Capitol Reef on 8/7 after the Grand Canyon, Zion, & Bryce Canyon on the previous 3 days. Although the park has its own unique, beautiful rock formations, in our opinion it suffers a bit in comparison with Zion, Bryce, & Arches. We did, however, have a wonderful day.The Visitors' Center was very well done, & there were numerous hiking options. Our group first wanted to pick apples near the Visitors' Center & then peaches at another location, but eventually we got into hiking. Our first car stop for a hiking trail started with a look at some ancient petroglyphs (not impressive.....). Then 6 of our group went off on a rigorous hiking trail while my wife & I drove to the less demanding Grand Wash Trail. Since I'm somewhat impaired by shortness of breath, the dry, flat riverbed of the Grand Wash Trail was a perfect hike for us. We had a beautiful, leisurely hike/stroll for the better part of 2 hours with towering canyon walls rising around every turn of the riverbed. Lovely......If you are into a wide variety of rock formations & have the time, by all means visit Capitol Reef. The nearby town of Torrey is also a surprisingly pleasant place to stay, reminding us of the wealthy valley that John Galt & his associates inhabited in ""Atlas Shrugged.""If you don't have the time, skip Capitol Reef in favor of Zion, Bryce Canyon, & Arches.","August 26, 2012","Beautiful canyons & hiking, suffering only by comparison with Zion, Bryce & Arches",287,"Fortson, GA",4

Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef is the least visited national Park in Utah but it does deserve your attention. Its a small park that can be explored in a day if thats all you have. Highway 24 runs through the park showcasing its red, gold, green, pink and white cliffs and canyons. Make sure you do the scenic drive which is mainly paved. It takes you into the heart of the canyon which then offers splendid views of the ever changing colours. At Fruita on the scenic drive stop for mouth watering home baked pies of cherry, apple and peach. They are simply divine. There are several short hikes, we liked the Gooseneck Point hike and also make sure you walk to see the Petroglyphs. You can gorgeous pictures around sunset.","June 11, 2012",An artists palette of bright colours,344,"Reading, United Kingdom",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"We found Capitol Reef a wonderful place to have a lunchtime break midway betweem Moab (Arches NP) and Bryce Canyon NP, though clearly one could spend a lot longer exploring the park more thoroughly, especially if one was able to take one of the longer trails. as it was we only had time to drive the paved trail called Scenic Drive (stunningly beautiful and varied geology), look at the petroglyphs and visit the various historic Mormon sites in the Fruita Historic District, We enjoyed peeking through the windows of the one-roomed schoolhouse and buying stuff (including a delicious cherry pie) from the Gifford Farmhouse. The best time of all was spent picnicking in and exploring the lovely Fruita orchards, lovingly maintained by the National Park. And it rained, lightly and deliciously, for the only time in nearly 4 hot, dry weeks in the USA. Anyone thinking of passing through this country, especially if they have to link Arches and Bryce, should aim to take at least a 3-hour break in this insufficiently-known gem.","June 10, 2012",Perfect mid-day stop in the desert (it even rained a little),98,"Edinburgh, United Kingdom",5

Capitol Reef National Park,"Capitol Reef National Park is a hidden gem in Utah. Located roughly four and a half hours southeast of Salt Lake (SLC) airport and three and a half hours southwest from Grand Junction, Colorado, the park is a treasure trove of geological features. Having recently visited the more well-known Zion National Park, which *is* spectacular, I can say that Capitol Reef has it beat by a mile in terms of geological and ecological diversity. It is also cooler and greener, owing to its higher elevation. That said, CRNP is much less developed than is Zion. Most of the roads are not paved, which can be a concern given that at this altitude precipitation is very possible. The Natl Parks Service is also quite restrictive about how this park is used. There are places in the park where visitors are not allowed (unless you have a specific reason to be there and permission to be there) and there are very few services and facilities compared to Zion. Because of this, Capitol Reef sees far fewer visitors. So for those who know about it, and who do not mind roughing it a bit more, it is a wonderful place to get back to nature. Because it is relatively undeveloped, this may not be a good choice for families with small children or people with mobility issues. We were also impressed by the little town of Torrey, Utah, which is about 20 miles west of the park. There are a number of fun, casual restaurants in Torrey, including the excellent Cafe Diablo. In addition, there is at least one higher-end resort and several motels/hotels nearby. Compared to Kanab, which is near Zion National Park, Torrey is quaint and funky.","June 7, 2012",Incredible diversity of geologic features in a nearly unspoiled national park,149,Florida,5
Capitol Reef National Park,"We camped here and loved this park. On the highway where the stream crosses the road is a swimming hole with a perfect waterfall for kids.

Capitol Reef National Park,"We enjoy Utah's National Parks but had never made it to Capitol Reef until this year. It is less spectacular than Zion, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands or Arches National Parks but no less beautiful and inspiring. The forces of nature that made Capitol Reef have created a work of art.We enjoyed more solitude and quiet there than in some of the other more popular parks. Take time to get out of the car and walk. We enjoyed hiking to Hickman Natural Bridge. The bridge is beautiful but the hike in is worth the price of admission. There are numerous other hikes varying from easy to very difficult.The park is not only geologically interesting but historically fascinating as well. Ancient hunters and gatherers lived in this area and left evidence behind. Petroglyphs and pictographs are numerous and accessible. The early Mormon settlers also left a rich historical record in the area.We didn't stay in the park but the campground looks very inviting and family friendly.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Wish I could rate this as ""good"" instead of ""very good."" This is better than ""average,"" however, which is why I rated it ""very good."" Saw this park after having seen Zion & Bryce NPs the two days previous. Perhaps this is why I was not as impressed with Capitol Reef as I may have been had I not seen the other two parks first. This park is interesting in its starkness but not as beautiful to me as Zion or Bryce. It's also a bit of a long haul from Bryce to Capitol Reef as well, over Hwy 12 with a lot of switchbacks. There was not much to see in the Fruita area, but did enjoy eating a picnic lunch there & buying a small pie from the Gifford Homestead. Bathroom facilities are fairly limited and so is food, so be sure to take your own water & food for meals. Wish there was better signage throughout park. Lonely Planet guide said that a dirt road at the end of the scenic drive continued into the waterpocket fold and we could see Pioneer Registry & some water tanks. However, road is very rough and kept going & going, much beyond a half mile...even with an SUV, did not feel comfortable continuing. Trails / trailheads are not well marked. Also, the rock formations are not labeled throughout the park and the signs for the pullover stops are numbered only going southward (see them in order from north to south, opposite of Bryce's scenic drive, which you should see from south to north). Did really enjoy 2-mile hike to Hickman Natural Bridge and the ranger talk at the visitor's center about the geology of the park. Currently, the theatre in the visitor's center is out of order. Petroglyphs on Hwy 24 are interesting & worth a stop. Park map shows Observation Point to be on east side of park off Hwy 24 but when we drove out there, there was nothing but a small turnaround & the park sign. There was a sign for Observation Point but it was on the west side of the park right before the Twin Rocks going eastward...strange.","May 26, 2012",Somewhat impressed,40,"El Paso, Texas",4

We took several drives back into the canyons and did some hiking where we could not drive. My wife and I highly recommend this fine National Forest Park. There are Petroglyphs on many of the walls.

Capitol Reef National Park,"I visited the interesting and attractive Capitol Reef NP for one full day, plus a late afternoon before/early morning after, as part of my month-long tour of the Utah/Arizona natural attractions last year. I approached it the day before from Bryce Canyon NP, via Boulder - driving the magnificent Burr Trail (see my review), as opposed to Highway 12 to ultimately get to my hotel in Torrey.To put things in perspective, Capitol Reef NP gets visitor numbers somewhere between 10-30% of those for Zion NP - it rarely gets what could be referred to as 'busy', but sufficient numbers still come to (from my experience) make empty spaces at trailhead car parking areas something of a rarity !I have compiled an extensive Trip Advisor 'Trip List' for my tour, which includes 'extra' attractions and also has links to the other individual TA reviews I've contributed for the accommodation/attractions I visited - it has been made a Trip Advisor 'Itinerary'; I hope it is of interest and use to you - I plan to add visitor information sections/viewable media sections..... The most direct way to access it is by clicking my review-count below my profile name to the left of this review text. Alternatively, see after my review below the dashed line... If you visited this NP in isolation you would justifiably be quite impressed; however, as you are likely (like me) to have arrived from seeing the spectacular sights in Zion/Bryce Canyon NPs everything here was a little bit underwhelming for me - especially as I had been 'spoilt' the day before as I got there via the Burr Trail.Inside the park there are some excellent close-up views of colourful/long rock formations/ridges on offer, a multitude of trails which can for the most part be flat and quite easy to access and also several pleasant picnic areas, BUT there are also many great views on Highway 24, which cuts through the northern section of the park right past the entrance....Admittedly, I only went inside Capitol Reef NP for a day, but although I did tour the scenic drive and hike a couple of trails I found that it is unusual in that most of the impressive views are away from the scenic drive itself, actually being either side of that Highway.For a few miles either side of the entrance/visitor centre there is a vast array of views on offer, comprising some exceptionally large and weird-looking rock 'mounds', a range of rock face types and various colours - the position of the sun obviously makes a massive difference to the appearance as well.I had originally planned to visit this NP for 2 full days, but after my afternoon stop the day before I quickly realised that that short visit, plus the following full day and then another drive past the morning after that (headed east after leaving my hotel in Torrey following my second night there) was going to be enough; with hindsight it was a VERY worthwhile decision....So, like Bryce Canyon, a longer time obviously might yield more enjoyment (especially if you intend to do some of the lengthy trails there), BUT I think you can get a lot out of a day (and a bit) in and around the park. Despite being a large area with lots to see, I don't think that is an unreasonable suggestion - supported to an extent by the NPS website for the park detailing what you can 'get out' of a visit in just a few hours, as well as adding a 'one day visit' section.The scenic drive really makes the park an easy and pleasant place to tour and you can readily make those small 'excursions' from it when you see a trail or vista that looks attractive.When on Highway 24 there is usually a generously-sized stop-off parking area somewhere near to a view worth looking at for longer/photographing. In fact, it's worth driving along it either 'side' of the entrance TWICE, by turning around a little further on to ensure you 'catch' everything, as the views are often dependent on you going in the right direction to see them ! Capitol Reef NP is very handily located when touring Utah via Highway 24 and offers many pleasurable, peaceful hiking/viewing opportunities that could easily occupy you for several days. However, despite it's size you can get a LOT out of 'just' one day in the park, the enjoyment of which will be magnified enormously if you can arrive via the 'Burr Trail' and also supplement your trip by sampling the varying, very impressive, views on offer from Highway 24 either side of the park entrance.I will add any relevant photos/videos after this review is posted by TA.----------------------------As well as the method described near the start of this review my TA 'Trip List' can also be accessed from the 'Utah Itineraries' link on the right of the Utah Forum page.

At the Giffords House you can see old kitchen and bedroom set up and buy terrific home made ice cream for $1. I had a chocolate cup sitting on the hand made bench outside watching the ponies and other picnickers and it was just lovely. We also drove to the end of the paved road and took way too many photos of every mountain, point, butte, point etc., as if we hadn't see enough all ready. But the views are quite different and the feeling is more intimate in this park. Make sure you bring water and stop at the Visitor Info ctr for bathrooming and maps.

We then did a drive down the Scenic Drive where many of the wonderful formations can be viewed - awesome sight! There is a fee for the Scenic Drive ($5). You pay for it by putting the money into an envelope and dropping it into the box. Since it is unmanned - do bring along the exact change. At the end of the paved road for the scenic drive, we continued on for about 2 miles along an unpaved road (drivable) to reach the start place of our hike in Capitol Gorge.

Capitol Reef National Park,"My wife, 2 year-old son and I had originally planned to visit Bryce Canyon and Zion National Parks (2nd time at Zion) and not go much further east. There are plenty of monuments and natural features to enjoy in that area within the Dixie National Forest. When checking out of the Best Western in Bryce, we mentioned to the woman at the front desk that someone suggested we go an hour further east to Escalante along the 12 and drive the Grand Staircase National Monument which we planned to do, we heard it was an amazing drive. The woman then suggested if we were going to go that far that we have to go another hour further east to Capitol Reef National Park and we are so glad that we took her advice.We had never heard of Capitol Reef and wanted to see this Waterfold which is essentially a 100-mile long wrinkle in the earth. You can't really see it when you are there, it's more of an aerial experience, but the rock formations and topography was just amazing. The drive there is beautiful and having driven it in mid-March was perfect because we only saw a handful of cars on the Highway 12 heading east over the course of 2 hours. Escalante itself wasn't much of a destination but there are so many little diversions from the highway that take you out to some fantastic sites, we checked out Devil's Garden which was cool but a 40-mile round trip diversion on a dirt road.We hiked as much as you can with a 2-year old but he is so active that we walked the whole 3-mile Grand Wash (which is flat) which took forever because my son had to pick up every single stone in the gorge.... and it is nothing but stones. The great thing is that there was so much that he could easily climb on this trail that made for a varied experience. The scale of the park and landscape was just awe-inspiring and the coloration of the rock formations was unique to the area. We even got to pet some horses in the park near the visitor's center, had a great picnic and felt we could've spent a couple more days there easily. The weather was gorgeous and about 75 degrees.Torrey is the nearest town here and there are some restaurants and a few hotels, not much selection. We had a terrible dinner from the restaurant across the street from the Best Western but that is for a different review!It was worth the extra drive, just make sure you have at least one full day and preferably two to really just chill and enjoy the park. It was pretty empty being Spring and we loved it, not sure what it will be like in the summer.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Like Utah's other 4 national parks, CRNP offers vistas whose beauty cannot be overstated. What differentiates this park from the others (save Canyonlands and far reaches or the other 3) is the solitude factor, which is high. Highly recommend R. Stinchfield's book to anyone considering a visit, especially hikers. Rangers confirmed its usefulness.We visited in mid-March. The downside was that the town of Torrey does not really ""open"" until April. There were only 2 - 3 restaurants open, and many hotels and inns remained closed. But we had the trails -- even popular ones - virtually to ourselves. We did three hikes totaling about 16 - 18 miles and saw a total of 7 other people (in 3 groups)! I'm confident that had we followed the more remote backcountry trails, we would have seen no one. Appreciate the stars and extra solitude, and don't worry about the cuisine! (Although we regret not trying Cafe Diablo, we still got to sample the pies in the Fruita village purportedly made by CD).As for weather, every skier knows what this year's (2012) winter has been like in North America - warm, with little snow, at least as of this review. We had access to most of the park (except for the Cathedral Valley) without a 4 wheel drive. On hikes, we had no issues with snow or water, including some slot canyons on the Cohab trail. For anyone interested in geology, CRNP is great to do in combination w the Grand Canyon. The GC starts with Precambrian rocks and goes through the Kaibab in the upper Permian (end of Paleozoic). CRNP starts w the Kaibab (in Freemont River Gorge) and goes through the Mesa Verde (Cretaceous, end of Mesozoic). Nothing beats the vista of the waterpocket fold from the Upper Muley Twist trail - we parked our car along the main Burr Trail Rd and hiked the 3 - 3.5 miles to the vista. .","March 21, 2012",Unique Beauty with Solitude,60,"new canaan, ct",5

My main goal at Capitol Reef was to hike to Cassidy Arch (as I share the same name) via the Frying Pan Trail. The trail was quite the hike and definitely an achievement for me. I did not see a sole until I arrived to the arch. The area is very beautiful and there were several stops along Hwy 24. The one I enjoyed the most was the Fremont pictographs- awesome! I also drove to Goblin Valley State Park which is about an hour away.There's a great campsite in the park though I didn't stay there. Another cool thing about Capitol Reef is the history of Fruita.

Take the side routes and you'll see what we considered one of the best Natonal Parks in Utah. Even if you are not into hiking [and we're not] the views are superb and worth spending even more time in it than we did.

The ranger was very helpful so that we could make the most of our day. I can highly recommend the Hickman Bridge & Cohab Canyon Trails. Both trailheads are near one another so you don't have to move the car. Two other trails are the Grand Wash & Cassidy Arch - again the trailheads are near one another. The Cassidy Arch is a strenuous hike and well worth what you see. We finished the day at Sunset Point. Of course take time to see the petroglyphs and pick fruit in one of the orchards.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Prior to researching and deciding to visit, I had never heard about Capitol Reef. It is the step child of the parks in Utah. While researching, I was emphatically told that it is a 1 or 2 day park....and not much more. However, after visiting, I can absolutely say I disagree. If you are talking front country activity, it is a quick visit park. But if you are one who likes to to explore a park, it has so much to offer. I visited for 5 days and could have stayed much, much longer.  The scenic drive and just the main drive into the park are awesomely beautiful. There are tons of photographic opportunities and lots of places to do short and longer day hikes. At sunset and sunrise both, there was always photographers out capturing the beautiful landscapes. The back country offers delights to those willing to get out and do some hiking. I am glad I went in October when it is cool/cold...making hiking in the desert environment much, much more pleasant. (plus it was great to see all the cottonwood trees with their brilliant yellow leaves). I did about 29 hours of hiking/backpacking in the park. All of the hiking was canyon bottom and some canyon rim. I hiked the Grand Wash, the Upper and Lower Muley twist canyons and several other sections. I love photography and had to walk with my camera always ready....there were so many 'ooooo and ahhhhh' moments that I had to capture on film. The park's star attraction is the Waterpocket fold....a major geologic feature. Rocks and enormous rock formations of all shapes, colors, and sizes bedazzle the eye. Reds, oranges, yellows, purples, browns, blacks, whites, creams....and many different shades of these colors are eye popping. Plus the enormous effects of water and wind erosion on the 'big wrinkle' is fabulous. Driving around the park is great. A good part of the roads are non paved and require a high clearance vehicle. I drove a Ford Escape and was able to go everywhere. It was fun to just drive and gape at all of the rock formations. So, if you have the opportunity to visit this park, please do. and take the time and effort to get out of your vehicle and explore. Go in search of the many, many hidden gems within this park. The other visitors I met who did go into the backcountry all agreed that the park was extraordinary. BTW...don't neglect to visit the Cathedral Valley section of the park!!!Note on camping....the main campground is Fruita...it is the only campground in the front country, it has a camping fee, and it is first come /first serve. There are 2 small primitive campgrounds ...one in the northern section and one in the southern section. the park is surrounded by BLM land and National forest. The Forest has several campgrounds that can be used. Plus, BLM allows dispersed camping ...(with certain rules). While very basic, all of the restroom facilities in the park were quite clean. The staff at the visitor center were extremely informative and friendly. I bumped into a Ranger while hiking out of my backpacking trip. Again, he was very nice and helpful. A++++ for service from all of the rangers and other staff members in the park!!!There are no restaurants or lodges in the park.

The easy hike down the dry wash (at least it was dry in October) is 2.5 miles round trip, and takes you into beautiful high canyon walls.

Capitol Reef National Park,"A bit off the beaten path (and much less visited) than other National Parks in Utah such as Arches, Bryce, or Zion, Capitol Reef National Park should not be overlooked. While the park is expansive, much of it is only accessible on foot -- or in high-clearance, four-wheel-drive vehicles. Thus, it's a great place for backpackers to find solitude -- especially in the off-season. However, many of the most beautiful sights (including the Petroglyphs) are close to paved roads and do not require long hikes to soak up the scenery. If you don't have four-wheel-drive, the safely accessible areas of the park can be seen in a single day; and the reddish-orange rock formations against a dark blue sky produce incredible photos. An unusual feature of Capitol Reef is its fruit orchards: apple, peach, pear and cherry trees grow in the park, and visitors are welcome to enjoy a free snack as they stroll through the orchards. In summary, if you're visiting one of the better-known national parks in Utah, a side-trip to Capitol Reef should definitely be on your itinerary.","September 25, 2011",Gorgeous Rock Formations Against an Azure Sky,108,"Lincoln, Nebraska",4

Capitol Reef National Park,"Our plan was to walk along the Fremont River trail. It was rather overgrown and buggy, but kids had fun petting the horses in the field and looking in the pioneer farmhouse. We stopped to pick apricots in the orchard - as many as you can eat for free and $1 per pound if you take them away. To the kids delight, the horses stuck their head over the fence and were loving to be fed the rotten apricots. I think we had more fun doing that than eating them ourselves!! We carried along the trail and it improved as it climbed up away from the valley. When we got the the end, the view was wonderful, well worth the moderate hike.We looked at the pictographs, which were rather disappointing to be honest - WAY better at newspaper Rock, Canyonlands.We walked along the grand Wash Trail and loved it.Weather was really disappointing when we were there. Big summer thunderstorms and the dirt roads were all washed away, we had hoped to come in on the Burr Trail rd, and continue north on Notom Bullfrog Rd, but that will have to wait for next trip, I guess!!","August 25, 2011",the orchards around Fruita were great,105,"Park City, Utah",4
Capitol Reef National Park,"We read that Capitol Reef was an ""undiscovered"" gem in the NPS system. We were disappointed to arrive there and find out that the scenic drive was closed into the park with the exception of the first two miles, due to a paving project. Prior to entering the Visitor Center area, we did hike to the Hickman Bridge, which is really an arch. This is a moderately strenuous hike and it is hot in the area. There were not many people on the hike or at the bridge. Also, make sure to stop at the petroglyphs. They are easily accessible from the parking lot and there are many good examples from the Fremont Indians. We did drive the two miles to the Gifford House, a Mormon settlement. We purchased the individual pies for each of us along with the homemade vanilla ice cream. We enjoyed our treat sitting at the picnic tables and out of the sun. The pies were okay, mostly containing thickener rather than filled with fresh fruit.

Make sure to head over Hwy 12 to Boulder, UT and drive to Hells Backbone. Worth the view.Finally continue a few miles to Escalante and hike to Calf Creek Falls.

We had a great stay in Torrey, Utah at the Days Inn (try the pizza at the Rim Rock Patio, especially if they have live music), then ventured into the park the next day. Is this park as spectacular as Bryce or Zion? No, but it is awesome nonetheless and with about one tenth of the summer time crowds. Check out Goosenecks, especially if you have kids who like climbing all over the big rocks. The hike up to Hickman's Bridge is moderately strenuous during the first half, but levels out and you are rewarded with a spectacular natural bridge. Plus, there were about six total people there .

The general information might scare you out of going down the last few miles of the Burr Trail (known as the switchbacks) into Capitol Reef National Park. It was a piece of cake. We even saw a small motorhome coming up the road, and they made it. Magnificent red bluffs accompany you throughout the Trail. And, go south on the road to Bullfrog Marina on Lake Powell, but turnoff to Halls Creek Overlook. It's a bumpy road with high clearance best, but we did see a sedan make it in taking it VERY easy.

Capitol Reef National Park,"We came just after the horrendous late Feb. storms. That meant that the main scenic drive to Capitol Gorge was closed due to road damage. We still had a pleasant drive, but couldn't see the most spectacular scenery. However we and the kids enjoyed going up to the old uranium mines (car got stuck in the mud, luckily a passerby had a chain and pulled us out) which are still radioactive. Signs there say not to stay more than 24 hours near the mines and not to drink the water, so it all felt quite adventurous, especially as we only saw three other cars the whole time we were there. This park is quite isolated compared to other National Parks in Utah.We thoroughly enjoyed looking at the Indian Petroglyphs carved in the cliff walls just outside the park entrance. They have done a great job providing viewing scopes to see the carvings, and a very nicely done and accessible path to walk along.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Humbled by the rocks, I'm writing here just a modest description (and adding a few pictures). The rock formations exposed in Capitol Reef cover the geologic periods from Permian to Cretaceous, 290 to 65 million years ago. This park is about the Waterpocket Fold, which extends for 100 miles! A video in the Visitor Center explains why it's called ""Waterpocket.""Capitol Reef consists of 241,904 acres (6.75 times the size of Bryce Canyon), but only has about 25 miles of paved roads (16.3 miles of UT-24 plus 8 miles of Scenic Drive). It's a great idea to bring a bicycle — a really good way to see the park and to go on the unpaved roads.In late October 2010, I camped two nights at Fruita, the only campground in the park. Fruita has three loops and is first-come, first-served. It seemed like that RV sites and tent-camping are not separate; so it's possible that you may be pitching a tent next to a Winnebago. Generator hours: April-Sept. 8-10 a.m., 6-8 p.m.; Oct.-March 8-10 a.m., 5-7 p.m.Mule deer passing through campsite, layered siltstone & mudstone reminding you of a chocolate dessert, towering massive sandstone..., and much more (see pictures).","November 9, 2010",The Waterpocket Fold,58,"Alta Loma, California",5

Capitol Reef National Park,"This is one of the stunning red rock parks renown in Utah. You can spend a couple days here with a couple of hikes and dips in the creeks. My favorite was going along Sulphur Creek, with the ""trailhead"" starting across the street from the Chimney Rock trailhead on the west side. After the initial 1/4 mile, this followed a creek back to the park headquarters, going through slot canyons. There were three pool areas, where you could take a dip and, at the last one, do some ""bum"" sliding. They were difficult to navigate, so this isn't an easy family hike. Another favorite spot with our group was where Deep Creek converges with the creek running alongside the main park road near the eastern border of the park. Just look for the parking area and then walk down toward the laughter. Kids love to climb up to jump into the pool next to the waterfall. On a hot day, this is a great area to cool off. Don't forget the bug spray. Along the main road, there are pull outs for petroglyphs and a couple historic ""pioneer"" buildings.

The park is more about the history of the people that lives there than about the natural history. We got to see an old schoolhouse and old pioneer homes. There was an old-fashioned store where you can buy items such as jam, ice-cream, and household items. There were a few hikes available, and a scenic drive.

Capitol Reef National Park,"Not sure exactly why, but I wasn't expecting much from Capitol Reef National Park. I probably wouldn't have gone out of my way to visit, but it's on the way from Moab to Bryce, so what the heck.The Mormon history was interesting, particularly since I am from Palmyra, the birthplace of Mormonism (although I am not Mormon). It's worth a quick stop at the historical Mormon orchards, the school house, and a farm. There are Indian petroglyphs near the school, but they are badly worn and a little difficult to see.The scenic drive through the heart of the park is well worth the time. It's a couple of hours well spent with some stunning scenery. The main road is paved.Drive down the dirt road to Capitol Gorge. Interestingly, there used to be a road that went all the way through the most narrow of canyons! Now, after a point, it's only open to hikers. With a relatively short and impressive hike you can see more worn Indian petroglyphs and a section of rock where pioneers (and others) have carved their initials with dates. Well worth the effort! Two impressive rock formations you see along this drive include the White Throne and the Golden Throne.Another dirt road leads down Grand Wash. I didn't do the hike here, but the drive was quick and impressive, particularly the scenic view about the uranium mine.The park also has a very pleasant looking campground and picnic area in a very shady area.Just outside and to the east of the park is a road worth taking for a view of Capitol Reef from a completely different angle. Go down Notom-Bullfrog Road for about 4 miles and you will see spectacular rock formations to the west. No pullouts, but there are a couple of spots along the highway where you can get very nice photos.All considered, Capitol Reef is worth the better part of a day.","May 10, 2009",Better Than Expected,272,"Colorado Springs, Colorado",4
Capitol Reef National Park,"We visited this park about 2 years ago during the hot summer month of July. We had made reservations to stay a few days at this hotel right outside the park, can't remember the name of it at the moment of this writing. It seemed like a very lonely area, not many people around at all, and we were only the second car visible in the parking lot of the hotel !!! That was not a good feeling either. In the park, we were THE ONLY PEOPLE inside driving around during the whole drive, we did not see anyone else!!! It was very creepy to us, so we did not get out and hike anywhere. If you needed help, it was if no one would know you were missing for days! We didn't even see a park ranger or anyone as such, and drove right in. The drive thru the park is really beautiful from the car, the roads were great, and we did see some ""faces"" in the rock formations that we managed to capture on camera. All in all this is not a place we felt we wanted to hike. It was very desolate and lonely. Great place if you want to be alone however! So if this is your cup of tea, this is a great place for you. We had been at Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, Sedona, and more during this trip and truly enjoyed hiking Bryce Canyon, at least there were people around from time to time. Lonely park, great sites and views, but not a place I would want to visit again. We spent one day here and stayed the night in our lonely hotel and cancelled the rest of our stay here and left promptly the next morning to our next location.

Capitol Reef National Park,"We originally intended to just drive though Capitol Reef but it was so peaceful and beautiful, that we ended up staying a night in the orchards campground. The park is quiet and serene. It was very hot when we arrived in the afternoon, too hot to hike and decided to set up our campsite and head to the historic Gipson House (right outside the campgound) for some home made pie and home made ice cream! The best pie I have ever had! They sell many kinds apple, peach, cherry, mixed berry.... something for everyone. The pies are small enough to share for two or three, so our family or four bought several kinds to try them all. We sat under some lovely trees, near an old Ford Truck, ate the delicious pie while enjoying the scenery and the deer walking right past us. It was one of those unplanned magical moments. There is some history here of the people who lived in the small town of Fruta (within what is now the National Park) with some historic buildings remaining. We stayed in loop C in the campgound, quiet, shaded and were surrounded by deer constantly grazing in the campgound. We took one hike, Capitol Gorge, early evening once the heat had subsided and the canyon was shaded.

You probably won't see many, if any, people so it makes for a nice and quiet hike. There are more people on the Hickman Bridge hike, but the Fremont River is pretty. There is a nice picnic area on the scenic drive right after the visitor's center. We enjoyed a peaceful lunch here along with many deer. There are some huge, old trees at this picnic area as well and I was impressed. This park has a serenity about it that makes you want to slow down and enjoy the surroundings.","July 16, 2008",Very nice day,128,Texas,4
Capitol Reef National Park,"Spent 7 nights in Capitol Reef. We have been to lots of National Parks and/or Monuments and Capitol Reef is one of my top favorites. It is quiet and peaceful. Big, big views of multi-colored cliffs, rocks, pinnacles, fins, arches, catherals and the like. We never saw more than a dozen people or so per day on the trails. If you are a hiker, you will absolutely love this park. The trails are two kinds: awesome views or awesome narrow canyons. There is no boring or bad hike. We did just about all of them. Each had great views for the entire length of the hike. The elevation climb hikes having panoramic views throughout. Did the Waterpocket Fold drive and OH MY!! So beautiful. Then we did the Cathedral Valley drive and were equally impressed. This is also a great park for the mobility impaired. Hundreds of gorgeous views right from the car. I don't know a sole who has ever been to Capitol Reef. Most of the visitors we met were from Utah. Only thing I can figure is that the locals are trying to keep this gem all to themselves. Capitol Reef is just as beautiful as Monument Valley, Grand Canyon, Arches, Canyonlands and Bryce, but different. In my opinion, it is the most colorful and has the largest variety of rock formations of all the desert parks. The town of Torrey is a small little gem consisting of about 8 hotels, 8 restaurants, a couple of gas stations and a Subway. Perfect for those wanting a relaxed trip. Never had to wait to be seated for dinner. Had good service at all of the restaurants. The people were polite and professional. Nobody trying to sell us a tour. No Chatty Kathys. The towns people were intelligent and helpful, but not overbearing.Honorable mention goes to Goblin Valley State Park. This is about a 2 hour drive toward Moab. Crazy little park with rock goblins all over the place. Made the children hop and jump around. Even the adults were inspired to join in games of hide and go seek.","April 29, 2008",Gorgeous Under Appreciated Wonderland - You Are Missing Out,100,San Francisco,5
Capitol Reef National Park,"This is a great trail giving you several levels of hiking -- easy if you stay in the gorge for the first mile and somewhat more difficult if you hike up the spur trail to the Tanks. Getting to see the Tanks is well woth the scramble up the rocks and slickrock. The trail is a series of switchbacks marked with rock cairns. The tanks are a series of large potholes, some filled with water and some are dry. Be sure to watch out for the petroglyphs that can be found about 1/4 of the way into the hike, which is 2 miles long round trip. The absolute best seasons for this hike are the fall and spring","July 4, 2007",Capitol Gorge Trail,158,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Capitol Reef National Park,"This is one of our favorite National Parks, although I don't think most people have even heard of it (let alone stopped to see it). Everyone is so busy rushing off to Arches or Zion & Bryce that they don't take the time to stop and explore this gem as well.Our favorite part was walking along the two ""washes"" - Grand Wash and Capitol Wash. It's an incredible experience to hike along a narrow gorge with vast walls of rock on either side of you. We have been here twice and will return again. We just love it!","October 29, 2006",Stop and see this great park!,70,California,4
