Guadalupe Peak,Started up at 4:50AM and was on the summit at 6:20AM actually had to wait a while to see the sunrise. I live at less then 100 feet elevation in Houston so this was a very easy day trip hike compared to higher elevation trips I usually take. This was my first visit and I had no issues with finding the trail via headlamp up to the peak its all class 1 hiking. There are not really any steep dropoffs or exposure along the trail I would say its safe for any age. Footwear was very low/lightweight barefoot style trail running shoes and had no issues presented by the rocks (full disclosure I run with no shoes on so have very flexible feet/ankles). The view from the summit is excellent and the summit is a large area with an steep dropoff on the West side. Going down there were a LOT of people hiking up so I would definitely recommend starting early to avoid crowds. I took the horse trail over to Devils Hall and then back to the parking area on the Devils Hall trail from there total distance 11.3 miles and about 4.5 hours with stops to take 300+ pictures and half an hour on the summit.,"September 30, 2019",Easy hike to state highpoint,91,"Katy, Texas",5
Guadalupe Peak,"Wanted to do this hike for several years. Finally took the plunge. First section is definitely the hardest. Once you turn the corner to the middle section, the trail eases up. Don’t let the last mile fool you though as it is just as difficult as the first section. Once you reach the peak, it’s well worth the track. Bring plenty of water!! Will do it again soon.","August 10, 2019","Tougher than we thought, but well worth it!",1,,5
Guadalupe Peak,"The Guadalupe Peak Trail was very easy to follow. Well marked, and yes tons of rocks where you can twist and ankle. When you get close to the peak its just rock no soft soil. I started at 5am when it was super dark but worth it, seeing the stars at that time was amazing! Took me 7 hrs to do the entire thing, had many breaks due to kids lol and water breaks and ""OMG Im getting a cramp break"" lol. I will say this... NOT FOR THE UNFIT. It really is a tough hike. It will mess up your knees. I took hiking poles and it made a world of a difference. I also made sure my kiddos had trekking poles, the hike does damage to your knees. Take plenty of water. I finished 3.5Liters of water in the hike. and ran out 3/4 of the way down. Honestly i dont see how people start late in the morning, it was roughly 110 degrees when i was going down around 2pm and people were barely going up. I highly recommend doing this hike early early early. Heavy winds in the morning but died down in the afternoon. Be safe, be prepared and be cautious!","July 9, 2019",Tough Hike but well worth the hike to the summit!,16,,5
Guadalupe Peak,"We did this because it was a friend's turn to decide our trip, and most of us liked the idea. We are not avid mountain hikers but in good shape. The hike was well laid out but was a challenge. Doing this in late-May, be ready to go through a lot of water! We were blessed with wonderful weather and little crowds. The views are great. The trip down poses the issue that you will probably be tired. Watch your step because if the stride is too long you are likely to slide in areas you might think are safe. That, and the rattlesnake, were the only real problems...","June 2, 2019",Worth Checking Off Your List,15,"Austin, Texas",5
Guadalupe Peak,"The weather was great - hot in the sun, just right in the shade, and cool at night. The temperature was in the low 80s and the humidity was about 10% during the Memorial Day weekend. In addition to Guadeloupe Peak, I hiked to the Grotto, Pratt’s cabin and Devil’s hall. A great time.","May 29, 2019",Good hiking,0,,5
Guadalupe Peak,"Coming from the south, you can see El Capitan for miles, Once you come to the sharp curves going up US-62, slow down you are almost there.We arrived just in time for the visitors center Ranger’s Patio Talk. This day they had a Red-tailed Hawk that had been rescued. It was amazing to see this large bird up close.Inside the visitor center the ranger suggested we take the trail down the to the Pinery Butterfield Station ruins. This is a nice paved trail that led to the Butterfield Stagecoach stop. It was a beautiful day to be out and enjoy the spring flowers.While our time was short at Guadalupe Mountains NP, we enjoyed ourselves and would return to explore more.","May 26, 2019",A Springtime Stop at Guadalupe Mountains NP,370,"Catlin, Illinois",5
Guadalupe Peak,"As others mentioned, be aware of high winds. Some were quite strong and able to knock you down. The first half is a slog and very taxing. It took us about 3 hrs up and 2 down. Great views and well worth the effort. ","May 21, 2019",Peak is a great hike ,79,"Houston, Texas",5
Guadalupe Peak,"Guadalupe Peak(GUMO) is the high point of TX. Not too long, however good elevation climb.Views are awesome yet you have to do your weather homework in advance. We were going to go earlier in the year however locals caution that it’s highly variable especially the winds. Winds were at 100 mph the week before we went. Once you are in April though you can see the advance forecasts...earlier in the year things change VERY quickly and are not forecast.It’s about 35 miles west of Carlsbad Cavern and if you stay at Whites City ( not the city of Carlsbad) you can use that as your base. It’s 110 miles east of El Paso. Topography is amazing as west Texas is flat and rolling except for the peak so, again, great viewsStart early, sunrise, to beat heat, avoid peak winds, and minimize rattlesnake encounters. Keep your eyes peeled both for phenomenal views and animals.","May 12, 2019",Great hike and locale with Carlsbad Cavern nearby,4,"Campbell, California",5
Guadalupe Peak,"I hiked the Guadalupe Peak trial at the end of March 2019, and it was pretty windy and cold, especially nearing the peak. This is a very popular trail and many people were hiking on the last Saturday in March. The trail is well signed, though mile markers are few. I found only one spot where one could possibly go off trail, but one would know soon if they went off. Trail condition is nice though one has to be sure-footed due to the rocks. One beautiful spot on the trail is the view of the wooden bridge bridging a crevice (after the camp site). Many hikers stop here for pictures. Also, the view of El Capitan from near the Guadalupe Peak is superb, but there are no trails to El Capitan. This a great day long hike.","April 23, 2019","Great Hike, but be ready for cold winds in March",157,"Kansas City, Missouri",5
Guadalupe Peak,"My wife and I have climbed some tall mountains so when we went to Carlsbad, NM, we wanted to climb Guadalupe Peak, the tallest mountain Texas. I don't think of mountains when I think of Texas but this was a good challenge, and it is taller than any mountain east of the Mississippi. The scenery was beautiful from the bottom to the magnificent view at the top. This is a steady climb that requires a higher level of fitness so don't think it's a walk in the park. Carry at least three liters of water and some sandwiches and snacks. It took us three hours to reach the summit and two hours to go back down. I thoroughly enjoyed this hike as well as the surrounding landscape. One of my best trips.","April 19, 2019",Be Prepared.,158,"Dover, Delaware",5
Guadalupe Peak,"Arrived Friday afternoon and tent camped. We picked a site with a tree and as much vegetation as possible to help block the wind. It was 38 mph with gusts up to 60 mph Friday and 35-50 mph with gusts up to 70 mph Saturday (hiking day) the worst part of the wind was trying to cook with our little propane stove. It blew out a few time. It wasn’t that bad when we were trying to sleep. The coyotes were howling pretty loud though. The wind wasn’t as bad as I expected. You are protected from it on a lot of the hike though some spots were pretty brutal... especially the top. The guides said this hike was 6-8 hours but we finished it in 4 hrs 24 mins. We didn’t stop much and got our pictures and left the summit quickly since it was bitter cold with the wind. I was also sick, had come down with an awful sore throat, headache and nausea the night before so I wasn’t at 100%. I would grade it a difficult hike solely on distance and elevation gain... along with some rocky parts of the trail. I actually slipped and fell on the last mile coming down and I’m usually really sure footed coming down. I had some muscle soreness the next day. Tips... don’t overdress or pack your bag too full but do bring water and a few snacks, gloves and a light jacket to block wind... a wool base layer and light down jacket is great. My hands started to get really chapped in the cold wind.","February 18, 2019",Great hike,5,"Fort Worth, Texas",5

Guadalupe Peak,"It was a great experience to hike to the top of the highest point in Texas. Unfortunately, it was foggy with low clouds so when I got to the top there was zero view. The hike was a hoot however. This is definitely a strenuous hike but can be done by anyone with willpower. Comfortable clothing, good hiking boots, plenty of water & food are a must. At the peak there is a ledger to record your visit and an obelisk to take a photo with. There are three other peaks to hike here as well that are a bit less traveled. There was several people at the top and I passed several going up and even more coming back down.","October 22, 2018",Great Steep Hike,66,"Austin, Texas",5
Guadalupe Peak,"This is a wonderful hike that is strenuous, but attainable for just about everyone who would want to do it. We went in March and the weather was pleasant (high in the 80s/90s) and cooler as we hiked up. I would recommend that you bring water bladder in a backpack to make stopping to drink water easier and to distribute weight more evenly, but that is just a suggestion. We are hoping to camp on the mountain next time we go!","September 4, 2018",Great hike and views,11,"Austin, Texas",5
Guadalupe Peak,"In my continuing effort to hit all of the state high points, I hiked Guadalupe Peak. I ate breakfast in Carlsbad, NM and then headed down to the trailhead. I should have gotten there sooner. I arrived around 9:00 a.m. and the temps were already in the 80's. Nonetheless, I started up the hill. The first few miles were steep and I was huffing and puffing until I hit the break at the ridgeline. After that, the grade is less severe and there is some cover from the sun in the trees. After a couple of miles, you come to a bridge across a canyon and then head up the final climb to the summit. The views from the top are spectacular; you can see almost 360 degrees. Given the heat and the afternoons thundershowers, I recommend starting this hike very early. It's well worth your time.","August 25, 2018","Hot, Steep and Spectacular",66,"Seattle, Washington, United States",5

Guadalupe Peak,"The Peak is quite senic and peaceful, after a good hike on a decent well maintained trail that preserves the wild nature of the countryside. There is a metal box with a notebook at the summit to write anything you wish. The hike is a bit over 8 miles round trip, first mile/last mile of the trail is the most challenging simply due to the loose rocky surface. It's a great hike and very much recommended! Be prepared for weather changes that can happen quickly and always check with the park staff before embarking to get latest weather updates, and pack at least a couple of liters of water. You can also take some energy gels and bars, easy to carry and they provide a carb/energy boost along the way with almost no added weight.","July 11, 2018",Rewarding hike with great views and nice trail,9,"Waxahachie, Texas",5
Guadalupe Peak,"My sons and I recently took a trip back to GMNP to do some backpacking and camping. We made plans to arrive on a Thursday in the hopes of getting the campsites we wanted as the park tends to fill quickly on the weekends, and campsites are all first-come/first-served. Our plan worked, and we had a great, shady site in Pine Springs, and we were able to reserve a site on the peak for the following night. The Pine Springs site is very nice. There are restrooms and water nearby, and the sites themselves all have tent pads and nice picnic tables. There also tends to be a nice breeze to help keep you cool. We camped there the first night, and found it to be very comfortable and quiet. We got up the next morning to a beautiful sunrise, and began our hike to the peak campsites and then to the peak itself. As many have mentioned, this is not an easy hike. The trail is very well-marked, but it is steep and rocky. Being that we were all carrying full packs, it made the hike even more difficult. My best advise for the hike up is to use trekking poles, bring plenty of water, and stop in the shade when possible. The trail is very exposed, but there are a few places with some nice shade. Rest in those places! Beyond that, its just a matter of grinding it out. It took us about two hours to reach the campsite. There are 5 sites with tent pads - though they are all a bit rocky. A few have some shade, and two are very exposed. I wouldn't want to be in one of the last two on a windy day/night. We dropped our gear, and continued our hike to the peak. I have to say that the views over the entire length of the trail are beautiful, but the Peak is just amazing and makes the hike worth every step. We were lucky to have a clear day, and could see forever. I had never been on a mountain peak before, and it was really neat to be able to see so far in every direction. After spending about 30 minutes at the peak, we began our descent back to camp. Once again, we were able to land a shady site. There was wind, but it wasn't anything crazy. The peak site is somewhat woody - enough that the trees block some of the wind, and would also allow for hammock camping. We had another quiet night, and a dark, starry sky. The next morning, we hiked back down and headed out. This really is a great park. While small, it offers some great opportunities to see some amazing beauty, do some challenging hiking, and see the top of Texas. It is absolutely worth a look.","June 5, 2018",Camping on Guadalupe Peak,18,"Dallas, Texas",5
Guadalupe Peak,"If you’re into hiking, check this place out. This sits within Guadalupe Mountains National Park. Entrance fee is $5 but this is waived if you have a National Park Pass. If your goal is to summit, then start early as the hot Texas sun will cook you at that altitude. There is water at the trailhead but be sure to bring plenty as you will be drinking a lot. Also remember sunscreen and a hat. The hike is 8.5 miles round trip with over 3,000ft of elevation gain, topping out at 8,751ft, so be sure to pace yourself.

It is a wonderful hike, and though there are some sections that are moderately strenuous it is not that bad. The ""summit"" is well worth the effort and the views are superb. And, C'mon, it's the highpoint of Texas!! You get to brag to your family and friends about that for sure.

Guadalupe Peak,"I've been up some high, and longer, climbs in the national parks before, but Guadalupe Peak is among the most strenuous of those treks. Between the steep uphill grade, high winds, and constant uneven ground, it is a pretty taxing trip up. Those same factors make it a taxing trip down as well. Along the way, there are varying views and a small mountain side bridge. The view at the top is a nice one, but with similar terrain at Big Bend, you can find better views at a fraction of the effort there. I would just caution people before they decide to make the hike that it is a slog. This is probably one I wouldn't hike again.","March 21, 2018",Effort vs Views,5,,3
Guadalupe Peak,"Yes this mountain is intimidating, it’s long, it’s steep, it’s windy.... but if you want to get to the highest point in TEXAS, you have to earn it. There’s no gondola ride to the top. 1st things first, if I see one more millennial hipster trying to hike in flip-flops I’ll puke. Don’t even attempt to be this stupid. You won’t make it. You real hiking shoes/boots and not the cheap walmart kind. You need a backpack with a gallon of water for just yourself, you’ll drink all of it. You need some cheap peanut butter crackers or some snack that will replenish your salt, that you will sweat out. Wear good wool socks, maybe 2 pairs of regular, your feet will hurt at the end even if you wear pillows on them. And people, wear a hat, it protects your nose and forehead, and you know, that thing you use, to make decisions with, from being burnt. A cool max long sleeve shirt is helpful, nylon pants if you’re smart, even wicking underwear that doesn’t chafe, no detail too small. Other smart things you should always hike with, emergency poncho, emergency blanket, sunblock, iodine/disinfectant, band aids, knife, compass, small mirror, whistle,  bandanna, hard candy, neck gator, gloves. Start early, it’s 7 1/2 hour round trip, with 30 at the top for selfies and to marvel at the incredible beauty of Texas, realizing how small you are, and that life isn’t really about you at all.

Guadalupe Peak,"Almost all our national parks offer real rewards for people who can stay in or near the park for several days and wander (via hiking or horseback or donkey riding) for miles off the road. But we, like many people, had a day to spend. We found we could do a lot and gain a lot of enjoyment, in just one day. Part of the trick was doing just the shorter, flatter hikes, and in some cases doing on part of them. So we hiked all the way to Smith Spring, but only an hour into McKittrick Canyon. We saw both visitor centers (briefly), we drove to the campground and back, and we walked to the remains of the stage coach stop. All of this took about 6 hours. We were staying about an hour away, so it made for a nice, full day for us. Doing much more, and even the last bit of Smith Spring were fairly strenuous for us (two seniors and one overweight 30-something), so keep that in mind. The park is close to Carlsbad and White Sands, but really far from anything else, so keep that in mind as well.It is not as spectacular as a huge cave or extremely white sand, but has its own southern Rockies beauty that we were glad we included in our trip.","December 21, 2017",A Day Trip to Guadalupe Peak National Park,15,"Austin, Texas",4
Guadalupe Peak,"Hiking up this trail is strenuous but it’s not too bad given it’s 4 miles up and 4 miles down. With just a daypack this trail is what of a moderate hike I would say, but if you carry a heavy pack up to camp ¾ of the way up then it’s definitely more strenuous. I recommend camping up at the primitive campsite 3 miles up, the views are spectacular and you’ll have a much more remote/primitive experience. There are 5 campsites up there, and they are on a first come basis (check with the park ranger first to see how many people are up there). There is no water anywhere along the hike so bring lots and lots of water as your body needs more than you think given the elevation change. Close to the top of the peak you’ll get amazing views of El Capitan and soon after you’ll be rewarded with views from the top of Texas at 8,750 feet. Even though these mountains are much smaller than those in New Mexico/Colorado, the elevation gain from the trailhead is not all that different at right around 3k feet.

Guadalupe Peak,"We're from CO so we weren't terrible concerned about hiking a ""8.5er"" when we've done 14ers. However, this one was a bit grueling as the elevation gain is fairly rapid and pretty darn constant. Very well maintained trail (mostly dirt, some rock toward the summit), great views at the top, and much of the hike (at least in the morning) was on the shadowed side of the mountain. There's a very cool metal monument by American Airlines at the top (that's how you know you made it!) and a trail book - don't forget to sign it! It's about 8 miles round trip, but if you can cut about a mile off the Devil's Hall hike if you just tack that onto the end of coming down Guadalupe Peak (the trail makes a little triangle cut that direction if you know what you're looking for). That makes for about an 11 mile day, but all worth it and beautiful. We highly recommend taking water and trail snacks, although we talked to someone at the top who happily did it without... but as avid hikers, we think he may have been a bit crazy. As an Infantryman he noted that he ""put the water where it mattered at the beginning of the hike... on the inside"".

Guadalupe Peak,"This hike is about 8 miles round trip. It can seem quite daunting, but as long as you take your time it’s doable for anyone in moderate shape. It took me about 2 hours and 40 minutes to go up and about 2 hours and 15 minutes going down. I’m a chubby guy that doesn’t exercise much so as I say it’s doable. There’s a logbook up there so you can earn bragging rights to sign in it. Be prepared for it to be extremely windy at the top due to the elevation. This takes you to the highest point at 8,792 feet above sea level. It has great views of the gypsum sand dunes as well as the top of El Capitan which is beginning of this mountain chain which is actually a fossilized reef. I highly recommend this hike for anyone from the state or just anyone that loves a view that goes on for days. I’d also recommend heading out south on 62/180 and stopping by the rest stop to get some great pictures of El Capitan as you are facing it. ","November 9, 2017",The top of Texas ,13,Midland,5
Guadalupe Peak,"I've hiked Guadalupe Peak about 8-10 times and it might be my all time favorite hike!! The views at the top and the sense of accomplishment of doing the hike make it great! However, be prepared for this, especially if you are not in good physical shape or an experienced hiker!It is only 4.2 miles up (8.4 roundtrip), but it's a tough hike. It is all up; almost 3,000 feet elevation gain!!! Very rocky and some steep sections. Good hiking shoes are a must!! If you can do it in 2 hours, you are in fantastic shape. Most people take 3 plus hours. And be careful coming down as the loose rocks are dangerous. The trail is well maintained and no danger of getting lost.Biggest problem I see when hiking here is that too many hikers don't respect the mountain and the hike. Too many causal hikers, especially in the warmer weather, are not prepared for this hike. They may make it, but it becomes a survival hike and not a fun one. I have quite often had to talk some parties out from trying to do this hike this when I see them in the first mile, dying from the heat, almost no water, in a skimpy t- shirt and no hat, and asking ""how much further is it?"".Guadalupe Peak is in a desert!! The summer heat and sunshine is brutal!!! I start before sunrise if I hike it in summer, so I'm down before noon. Also, take plenty of water. A minimum of 2+ liters per person. I take more so I can stay well hydrated and enjoy the hike. (And often share some with some others who are running out!) The first and last miles are all in the sun, very rocky, and no fun at all if you are getting dehydrated. And wear proper clothing to protect yourself from the sun!!! I usually wear a big, floppy hat, sunglasses, a loose, long sleeve shirt, and shorts. In the cooler months, have rain gear or cold weather gear for protection from the terrible winds or storms. Most of the hike is along exposed trail, so be prepared, hot or cold.That being said, it is a wonderful hike.

Guadalupe Peak,"Guadalupe Peak is listed as the highest point in Texas. It's nothing like hiking a 14'er in Colorado, but it's a fairly challenging climb nonetheless. The first mile and a half will get your heart started. Bring plenty of water and have a few layers of clothing to put on or remove as needed. There are a few exposed sections toward the top but my wife, who has a very real fear of heights, handled it like a pro. There's a nice little scramble to reach the summit, so if you're using poles put them away and use your hands. Once on top, sign the logbook, take some pano shots and have lunch. This hike took us about 6 hours roundtrip, including almost an hour at the summit. It did start to rain on our way down so you might want to carry a rain poncho in your pack. We both really enjoyed this hike! ","September 5, 2017",Great hike in a little known park.,59,"Imperial, Pennsylvania",5

Guadalupe Peak,"If you are adventurous, physically fit, and not afraid of heights, this is an awe-inspiring hike with majestic views. If you are in average condition and somewhat afraid of heights like me, this is an extremely strenuous uphill climb that is slightly terrifying in some spots, but worth every moment. It took me a little over 8 hours to get up and down the mountain on a beautiful day with perfect weather. I made it to the top of the mountain, but couldn't bring myself to cross the last rocky ledge before the monument on the peak. Whether you make it to the peak or just hike part of the trail, you will be rewarded nonetheless. Preparation is VITAL on this hike - educate yourself and take all of the recommended essentials. There is a nice Visitor Center where you check in and pay a small fee before your hike. Restrooms and water are also available at the trail head.","June 27, 2017",Majestic,28,"Frost, Texas",5

Guadalupe Peak,"You can do it! Guadalupe peak is a difficult hike, but an average person can make the summit with a little preparation. I'm in average condition and I made the round trip in 6 hours. After climbing 2900 feet over 4 miles, views are spectacular. High five yourself and sign the logbook at the top! Here's a few tips if you go:- Plan ahead, plan ahead, plan ahead- Guadalupe Mountain NP is remote. It's an hour from Carlsbad and gas stations.- Parking is plentiful, but may fill on weekends.- Sign the logbook at the bottom and pay the small fee.- It can be very hot or very cold. Check ahead. - If it's hot, go early. Like 6:00 am. About 80% of the trail is exposed to sunlight and heat.- If it's cold, go later to give the sun time to melt snow and ice.- Wear sunscreen. Take extra.- Take a gallon of water! You think I'm exaggerating, but you need it. I took half a gallon and ran out halfway down. - Water and bathrooms are available at the trailhead. - If you're in great shape, plan 5 hours. If you're average, plan 7 hours or more. Don't be in a hurry. Going down takes as long as going up due to the uneven trail.- The trail is very clear and well-maintained, There is little chance to get lost if you keep your eyes open.- There are a few steep drops, but the trail is generally safe.- Wear sturdy shoes. The trail is uneven and covered in large rocks. Ankle turns are a distinct possibility.- Views along the way are great with 30+ miles of visibility.","June 13, 2017",How to Enjoy Guadalupe Peak,472,"Lexington, Kentucky",5

It took about 7 hours to finish, and all of us where very happy of our accomplished experience. The views from the the summit are AMAZING!!!

Be sure to drink water & snack all along the hike to fight off elevation sickness. By starting early you miss the heat of the day as you climb, as well as the crowds. There are stretches on the hike that are exposed to direct sun & heat. As the hike progresses, you enter forests which provide shade and cooler temps. The trail is well-maintained.

Guadalupe Peak,"We went to the Guadalupe Mountains and Carlsbad Caverns at the end of April. Was aware of the warnings about wind and weather, but wasn't expecting snow/sleet on the mountains and morning lows below freezing.Bundled up and layered for the hike, but the wind was relentless. Weather.gov showed 45 mph sustained winds and gusts over 60 mph. It was a difficult hike but the view and experience made it worthwhile. It ended up taking our group of 4 hikers ages 32-57 8 hours for the round trip.In spite of the difficulty, I would do it again. I would be more prepared for more weather extremes. Definitely, carry at least 4 quarts/liters of water. Even in the cooler temps, I used up almost all of my water.You will need to be in great physical shape. As the 57-year-old in the group, I spent 5 days a week in the gym doing the Stairmaster, treadmill at 10+% incline, and interval training getting prepared. It is a long 4.2 miles of steady climb on a rocky trail. The trail is worthwhile, just be prepared, physically, with warm and cool clothing, plenty of water, and high energy food/snacks.","May 8, 2017",Difficult but rewarding hike.

Guadalupe Peak,"Admittedly I've been in better shape for other hikes I've done, but regardless of that, this is the hardest hike I've ever done. And I would readily do it again. The first mile and a half are tough. The trail had big rocks on the path and part of the path is on uneven mountain rock. There are two sections of mountain rock with a sharp drop off on one side but after that section the trail improves. I can be a bit of a scaredy cat but I was able to hug the wall on one side and get through fine. There really is plenty of room. Once you get near the top, the trail gets steeper and you encounter more trail over mountain rock. There were a couple of sections near the very top I felt more comfortable crawling over. I just took my time and we made it to the top fine. We started early but being a free entry day, we had to park at the visitor center instead of the trailhead. This added about a mile to our hike. We got a lucky day with low hanging clouds that we hiked through. While we were at the top those burned off and we got a great view. It was sunny and exposed most of the way down without clouds. It was a rare day where it was warmer at the top than the bottom but we still needed layers. I had hiking boots but my friend had trail running shoes and those worked fine for her. We both had poles and were very glad we did. We did see other people without poles though. I drank 4 liters of water (I usually drink more than most people). I didn't keep track of how many calories I took in but be prepared to eat along the way. The trip back took longer than I thought because of that last mile and a half stretch. It took us about 7 hours after spending time on the top to eat and enjoy the view. ","April 27, 2017",The hardest (and most worthwhile) hike I've ever done ,54,"Lubbock, Texas",5
Guadalupe Peak,"Entrance fee for the Guadalupe Mountains NP is $5 (well worth the money). From the trailhead, it's 4.1 mi/6.6 km to the peak with a elevation change of 2900 ft/885 m. We did this hike on a Monday in April - started at 9am and made it back by 2:30pm (2 hour 45 min ascent, 30 min lunch, 15 min snack, and 2 hour descent). We're very fit and active and are avid hikers. The trail was very well-maintained up to the campground. The initial climb from the trailhead to Around the Bend as well as the final ascent to the peak were challenging - large steps in the initial climb and massive boulders on the final ascent. We must have started at a popular time because the trail was a bit crowded initially but quickly dispersed after the Around the Bend. For the most part, we felt like we were the only people on the trail. The panoramic views from both the trail (especially at Around the Bend) and the peak were incredible. It's a hike that we will remember. We brought 1 gal/4 L of water per person and had about 2 L leftover. We hiked in T-shirts and shorts and brought thin long sleeves for the peak.

Also, this is one of the few hukes I have taken where going down took almost as long as going up. I do have bad knees which slowed my pace but there are few areas that are not rocky. I saw many people leave too late in the day forgetting that it gets dark early. Only a few were prepared to come down in the dark. If you leave after 10am take a good flashlight.

Guadalupe Peak,"By no means do I consider myself an experienced hiker, but I have hiked several times before, including a number of trails in Glacier National Park in Montana. And let me say, this is no easy trail! The trail is very rocky--either you're hiking over rocks the size of your fist or scrambling over glass-smooth boulders. Several times the trail is narrow, with a steep precipice on the other side from the mountain. The roughness of the trail makes for slow going. Also, the trail is a steep one--the trail starts off around 5,700 feet above sea level, and gains 3,000 feet in elevation by the time you reach the summit, so it's a strenuous climb. However, when all is said and done, you can sit on top of the highest point in Texas, knowing that you endured. Be sure and take some pictures and sign the guest book as well. The view of El Capitan is awesome from the peak, and the surrounding countryside is stunning. The hike down is faster, but still tough, so make sure you pay attention to where you put your feet.

Depends on where you're from, and the hikes you are used to doing.If you're from Arizona it's a nice day hike.From the midwest? The hike of your life.From the eastern mountains? It'll get you huffing, mostly because the air thins out (peak is at 7800 ft).The trail itself is steep for its length (2900 ft elevation change over >4 miles. The first 3/4 mile is very rocky, wear good hiking boots if you're not used to that type of terrain. That first 3/4 is also filled with steps (to control runoff), so your calves are going to get a good workout as well. After that the trail is rocks on a dirt path until you break 7,000 ft were it turns into mostly solid rock.

Not impossible but definitely something you need to be ready to tackle. It has been a warm November but we took seriously the advice to bring layers. We did first 2 hours or so in short or light sleeves. Last hour stretch we were wearing skull caps, heavier jackets and gloves. Temp changed quick. Heart broke for young lady in shorts and light long sleeves. Views were awesome. Pics don't capture how far you can see. Signed book and made sure to get our energy back while you are up top. Up there we met a 76 year old lady who was a hiking machine! On the way down it misted on us which made rocks a little slick. Through all this me and my 9yr old son completed up and down in just under 7 hours. This hike is doable but make sure you read the reviews, it's not a tourist event. Our key words were ""smart steps"" because of the loose rocks and steep drop offs in certain sections of trail and ""layers"". On the way down muscles were burning but my son affirmed it was worth it. Definitely worth it! One last tip, bring food for after hike if you end around lunch time. We had snacks for trails but were craving more when we were done. No restaurants, concessions in the park and closest is about 45 minutes away.

We begun our hike on a Thursday afternoon at about 10:45am and started up the Tejas Trail. Little did we know that the first 4 miles of our hike would be totally uphill - switchbacks all the way up the mountain. It was a very strenuous uphill climb, and we had to take many breaks, making our 4 mile trek take approximately 3 hours. We stayed the night at the Tejas Campsite - it was a great spot protected from wind by trees. It was a nice place to camp, even though we fell asleep at sundown because of the hard hike we had just made up that mountain. The next day we ended up hiking all the way from the Tejas Campsite back to our car at the Pine Springs Trail Head which took about 7.5 hours. By about noon, it started raining and hailing on us and we were cold, wet and determined to get back to the car! It was 7.5 hours of more difficult hiking.

The trailhead parking lot was already full, requiring me to park at the visitor center and walk the half mile to the trailhead. Not a big deal. As said in other reviews, the first mile is the toughest. Not kidding. Steep incline, loose rocks, I was sweating within 5 minutes and never needed the light coat in my day pack. Beautiful views, seemed every-time I looked up from the trail I wanted to take another picture. I spent 20 minutes at the top, enjoying the accomplishment of standing on top of Texas. The hike down was tough on my knees. Lots of loose rocks require you to step carefully. I made it to the top in 2 1/2 hours. Down in 2 hours.

I had a 3L platypus and a smart water bottle with me, I ended up drinking 3/4 of my platypus water for this hike. I highly recommend hiking poles as mine saved me a few times from falling. Be careful on the way down because those rocks will cause you to slip and fall, I found it easier to walk side ways at times. I highly recommend this hike as it is truly beautiful when you get to the top. My ankles and knees hurt really bad by the time I was done but they were fine the next day.

Guadalupe Peak,"The National Park Service refers to the Guadalupe Peak Trail as ""strenuous."" That is no exaggeration.I'm not much of a hiker, so climbing this trail was intended to test my limits. It surely did. That said, making it to the top is doable for people of varying skill levels.My wife, son, and I all made the climb as part of a group. We took advice from other reviewers and made sure to be prepared before we set out. Each of us had a gallon of water, and we used most of it during the trek. We also packed energy bars and other snacks, and we ate most of those as well. Finally, we got some trekking poles, and while they may be awkward for some, they helped us from wearing out or knees.The first mile is the hardest, with a lot of steps carved into the trail. It goes through a series of switchbacks before entering a forested area, which had less of an incline. Finally, you cross a bridge and then enter the last stretch, which sometimes seems more like a goat trail on the side of the mountain, and can be very steep at times. However, once you clear the top and see the metal pyramid marker waiting for you, you'll know it was worth it.The views will get progressively better as you climb, but none top the view from the peak. It's fantastic. Make sure you sign the record book kept in an ammo box while you're there as well.A final note: The decent can be even harder than the initial climb. There are loose rocks underfoot, and everyone in our group said that was actually worse than the initial climb before it was over. Make sure you get your strength back before venturing down.","October 3, 2016",The Top of Texas,6,Midland,5
Guadalupe Peak,"My husband and I are avid hikers from East Tennessee. This hike was so different from what we're used to. First, the humidity was practically non-existent. Amazing! Second, the altitude was much higher than what we're used to. Not so amazing. Third, the terrain was very open; we're used to trees blocking our view of pretty much anything so it was really cool to get to actually see the shape of the land.For the hike itself... it's very true. The first 1.5 miles are the most difficult. That's not to say the other 2.7 are easy, but they're not as strenuous. Part of what made this hike difficult for us was the unsure footing. In the Smokies, the paths themselves are flat soil. Here, loose gravel and rocks litter the path. We had to pay much closer attention to our steps. Now, my feet HURT! We made it up to the peak in just over 2 hours. We stopped a few times along the way and were at the peak for approximately 20 minutes. The entire trip took 4 hours, 20 minutes. There isn't a lot of shade but thankfully we had sunscreen. Also, the wind was blowing pretty hard. Beware of that. Good news, it kept the insects away! We arrived at the parking lot around 7:15am and took the last open spot. There is additional parking elsewhere, but the designated lot it small. I highly suggest getting on the trail as soon as possible. The peak wasn't very crowded when we were there but based on the large number of people we passed, it probably got crowded. Also, it gets HOT later in the day. Go early.Overall, we loved this hike. It was tough but doable and showed us terrain we don't usually get to see.

Guadalupe Peak,"We dreamed of climbing to the highest point in Texas, but we did a number of things that doomed us. First we didn't get on the trail until 10:30 AM (should have started by 7 or 8:00 AM). Second it was summer time (first Sunday in August), (78°F when we started, nearly 100°F when we finished). Third we were only in average shape. Fourth we didn't account for the fact that altitude may affect us. The hike starts at approximately 6000 ft above sea level and finishes at approximately 9000 ft above sea level. Finally, we didn't bring enough water (at least a gallon or 4 liters). Despite our missteps, we did make it 2/3 of the way there (although it took us 4 hours). We loved the views and we did get our altitude legs after about a mile. The only smart thing that we did was realize our limitations and turn around when we did. Actually, we did two smart things and used hiking poles - really useful on the way down. We would love to come back and attempt the hike again.","August 26, 2016","Worth The Effort, Even If You Don't Make It",101,"Cumberland, Rhode Island",5
Guadalupe Peak,"Full disclaimer: All characters appearing in this essay are absolutely real. All resemblances to real people, living or dead are entirely intentional. We had planned a short visit to Guadalupe Mountains National Park towards the end of May. Now we can convincingly claim that was not the best of ideas. The heat (especially during the day) was quite painful and only second to probably a visit to Death Valley during July. There was a raging forest fire which had forced closure of most of the park's attractions like McKittrick Canyon, Devil's Hall, Dog Canyon etc. So we decided to warm ourselves up with the Smith Canyon trail on the first day. Next day, we embarked on the most anticipated part of the trip. The 9 mile (round trip) hike on to the highest point of Texas with an elevation gain of 3000 feet. Start early in the morning if you want to try it, especially in May. Take my word, we had started at around 11 AM. Make sure that everyone has access to sufficient water/Gatorade and some energizing food like protein bars, bananas etc. throughout the climb and descent. We started off as a group of 10 with supplies unevenly distributed as burdens of the experienced climbers. We got separated along the way, and for some of us the last bit of the climb was fueled more by the promise of water/food at the summit than by anything else. So stick together as a group and make sure everyone's hydrated. Our group had a few experienced hikers, some others not as much athletic and at least 3 people who were on the first real hike of their life. A group of 4 reached the summit in 3.5 hours along with most of the food and water. 2 others made it in about 4 hours mostly because the food/water at the summit was closer than the campground below. The 3 new climbers were woefully unprepared for the challenge and had to turn back quite early, leaving just one person from the last group to make the rest of the climb. We came to realize how terrible of an idea that was while on our way back. We had two very close encounters with rattlesnakes and barely escaped a bite. If you are still reading and willing to brave all of this, (and you SHOULD) then you are in for an exhilarating experience. Make ample stops along the way to marvel at the views (and catching your breath). Look out for the tiny markers just to keep the anticipation growing. Keep talking to the people coming downhill just to enjoy all the wonderful reactions and re-motivating yourself. If you are at the small bridge then you have almost made it. It is a civil offense in the state of Texas to turn back from this point. There is a conical monument at the summit to share your victory with and a log book, secured inside an ammo box kept at the base of the monument, to document your achievement. Do not forget a camera or a fully charged mobile to capture these memories. And do soak in the 360 degree views that stretch for light years on all sides. Yes, you've made it to the highest point of Texas. Enjoy the moment !!PS: Be careful, not to get lost in your moment of glory. You are bound to get one of the worst sunburns of your life if you have not taken precautions and are waiting at the summit for hours.","August 24, 2016",An experience worth sharing!,67,"Vicksburg, Mississippi",5

And the views are simply incredible. Most of the trail is very good, but there are some narrow spots along steep edges. Past the bridge about 80% of the way up, the trail gets very rocky and steep.

Guadalupe Peak,"I'd hiked the highest point in Arizona earlier in my road trip, only to find the top completely fogged in. I was hoping this hike would be different and I'd be rewarded with the excellent views I'd seen on the internet over Texas. Unfortunately a storm was rolling in and again the top was completely fogged in when I got there. I was happy to be almost back at the bottom when the thunder and lightning started.The first few miles of this trail seemed the worst for me - some very steep switchbacks that never seemed to end, along with plenty of loose rock underfoot. I did enjoy the hike though, and would happily do it again in future for a chance to see the views from the top.","August 9, 2016",Just my luck!,185,Scarborough,5

Guadalupe Peak,"Bring plenty of snacks and water for this rugged hike to the top of Texas. The 8 mile round trip trail is well marked but rough with a lot of hiking on rocks, so wear sturdy hiking boots. It's a consistent hike gaining 750 feet of elevation per mile. The scenery is wonderful and improves as you climb higher. Unfotunately, the day I climbed, there were wildfires in New Mexico which made the sky rather hazy. Start early in the day as the temperature can get rather hot in the summertime. It took me around 5 hours to complete the hike.

Guadalupe Peak,"My first time and I loved it. There a few important points...if you are coming in summer, bring LOTS of water. There are no places to get food or water so you have to bring it with you. Plan to start early if you are planning a hike. You also need to wear sturdy shoes. OK now the good stuff! There are a number of trails to choose from. Some of the farther trails were closed due to a fire, but I walked McKittrick and it was GORGOUS. Rugged in places but a well maintained trail. Lots of places to stop and rest, have a snack/lunch. Allow plenty of time and go to the grotto if you can. I didn't climb to the peak, but am told it is fantastic.","June 20, 2016",A great experience,89,"Texas Gulf Coast, Texas",4
Guadalupe Peak,"This mountain kicks butt because the trail is good but has rugged terrain as well (i.e. rocks, boulders, and dirt). I lost the entire sole of my boot 1/4 of the way up and finished with no bottom sole on one foot. Coming down would have been more painful as I approached the bottom of the trail and was getting tired. My sole had worn out. Luckily I had two rubber bands and was able to attach the sole to my boot a bit. It helped going down.The climb is quite steep, and I do NOT recommend it in the hot summer as it remains in sunshine almost the entire time! The peak has NO shade! We went when the temps were in the mid-90s - 100. Stupid, but we were very lucky. About 1/3 of the way up, a huge sheet of cloud cover came and stayed with us for a few hours until we got to the top. So we had shade and some great wind along the way. How lucky was that!!! My husband would have probably gotten heat stroke if we had not had that cloud cover. Be careful of children. Keep them cool.Hike with poles if you can - it helps a great deal going up and down to ease the pressure on the knees no matter how young you are. There are a couple of hair-raising cliff-edge turns IF you are afraid of heights, but no biggie if you are not. My husband is afraid, and it was do-able for him even though his heart was beating on those parts.The top is neat on a clear day, but I was a little under-whelmed. Maybe it's because I've been to better plateaus in the red deserts of Utah and Arizona. Nevertheless, it's great to be on top of TEXAS!","June 17, 2016",Steep! Rugged! Great Workout!,15,Dallas,4
Guadalupe Peak,"Compared with the Cascades, which I visited last summer, Guadalupe Peak doesn't seem very tall, so I went into this hike thinking it would be pretty easy. This was not the case. The hike was fairly strenuous, though not super long. It took me about 4.5 hours and that included a half-hour wait for a thunderstorm to stop.The views along the trail get better as you go.

The rangers are helpful and offer their takes on other nearby hikes. we also hiked rattle snake canyon in New mexio.

Guadalupe Peak,"I am a moderately experienced hiker and this was a very strenuous hike for me! I loved it though! It took us 7hrs., 50mins. roundtrip. This is on the high end of estimated hike times given by NPS-most people we talked to finished in about 4 1/2-5 hours roundtrip. A couple of people finished in 3 hours! Don't get intimidated by other people's finish times, though. It is definitely better to take your time, go at your own pace and enjoy the experience rather than rushing through and hating every second of it. We started out half an hour before dawn and got to see sunrise over the long horizon as we hiked up trail. The first 1.5 miles is hard, both ways. It is steep and we gained approximately 1700ft in elevation in just the 1.5 miles when we reached ""around the bend"" and started hiking on the north face of the mtn. The total hike to the peak culminates in about 2900ft of elevation from trailhead to peak, so you're over half of the total elevation in the first mile and half-if that gives you any indication of the steepness. The parts of the trail with built in cedar and stone steps help give the trail structure but also add to the difficulty as you are forced to climb steps rather than just walk -this can be a pain to knees and hips. The trail is well laid out for the most part, but there is a lot of loose rock so wear sturdy, broken in hiking boots with good traction. There were people with and without trek poles. We used ours and were thankful for them especially on the way down. There is very little leveling out on this hike so it is almost constant uphill on the ascent and downhill on the descent (which you'd think would be good but our toes and ankles begged for uphill momentum after a while). After you cross the bridge, which is situated at approximately 3.2 miles, there is a ""false"" summit that will make you hopeful that you're almost done...But you're not. There is one mile left to the peak which includes scrambling with hiking. The last mile consists of switchbacks that are littered with scree and with sections that required us to scramble over smooth rock-faces to continue on the trail. The difficulty in this is that we were at about 8600ft elevation at this point, the wind was pretty strong and the trail was very narrow. But we got a great view of the back of El Capitan which kept us going. Once we got to the top, the view of the Chihuahuan Desert and the Guadalupe Mtn range as well as the accomplishment of getting to the highest point in Texas rewarded us and made it all worth it. On this hike/scramble, there are lots of photo ops so take moments to stop for photos and to enjoy the views as well as to sip water and eat snacks. We each finished about a gallon of water, so bring plenty of water. Wear layers since the north face is the ""windy"" side of the mountain where it gets chilly even if it's 70+ degrees on the sunny side. The peak is also chilly and windy. As always on hikes, wear lots of sunscreen and a hat as well as your sunglasses. Even if you feel you're not ready to try to get to the peak, hike at least to around the bend because you will get a spectacular experience and a lot of great pics! Also, it's suggested to come either early in the day or later in the afternoon as the hiker parking lot gets full. $5/person entry fee that you pay for at the self-registration board to the right of the trail head. There are bathroom facilities with flush toilets and running water to the left of the trail head.","March 27, 2016",Slow go is better than no go (this hike includes sections of scramble),77,"Fort Worth, Texas",5

We also checked out the guadalupe peak campground which looks like a great place to stay if you have the ability to trek all of your gear up.Overall the first and last mile are the toughest like alot of reviews I've read. About half way down you should start to feel the wear on your feet and knees. We were happy to make it back to the car but there were no campsites left so make sure to grab one when you get there.

Guadalupe Peak,"The hike to Guadalupe peak had been on our list for some time. First visit to area was raining, second trip was 14 degrees and snow covered. Finally had two days where we could get all of the kids home. Drove 7 hours straight and arrived at 2:00PM. Find the last campsite available. They do not reserve campsites. Very risky as there are no other accommodations nearby. Spent the night and awoke to a beautiful morning ready to conquer Guadalupe Peak. Four teenagers and two out of shape forty something tired parents. I must say I am a very stubborn and determined individual. When I saw I will conquer the peak,,,I will not be stopped. Thank goodness for that determination, because I would have ""Retired"" from the hike during the first mile. This was the hardest thing I have ever done. 250 lbs plus a 25 pound backpack. It was literally one step in front of the other. Thank goodness for some hikers who told little white lies about how much further. One said just 40 more minutes... try two hours. My kids did great and my wife (who was afraid of heights) all made it. Definitely worth the trip, but please get in shape. Getting hurt up there would be very dangerous. 2.75 hours to get down. Your knees and ankles will be screaming at you. All the way down, you will be asking yourself, ""how did we climb all the way to the top"".

Guadalupe Peak,"This was a tough ~8.5 mile round trip hike to the highest point in Texas, but worth every step. The views along the way were glorious and as we got higher and higher up it just made the hike all the more thrilling.We took a little less than 3 hours to reach the top and around 2 hours to go back down, so allot yourself at least 6 hours for this hike. If you go a little later in the day as we did (around 2:45 pm), make sure to bring warm clothing and a source of light for the way down. We were lucky to still have sunlight on the way down and made it to the bottom just as it got dark.Since we started the hike at an uncommonly late hour, the majority of the people we met were making there way down as opposed to up, and so when we reached the top we had the area to ourselves, which was nice.It was *extremely* windy both ways so be sure to bring proper clothing for the hike. Also make sure you have a good pair of hiking shoes because going down the mountain will take a toll on your feet.We mainly saw couples and friends hiking the trail, but occasionally we saw some kids with their parents and even a school group of boys along the way. This is a long and challenging hike, so make sure to bring food, water, and extra batteries for your phone or camera. My phone died just as we reached the top so I didn't get any photos up there, but luckily my friends had their cameras.Lastly, whether you're hiking up or down, take a moment to say 'hi' to the other hikers, ask how they are doing, and offer them encouragement for their journey. A little of that goes a long way.","March 18, 2016",Beautiful hiking views,9,"Austin, Texas",5

After visitor center visit, we went to Frijole Ranch and Manazanita Spring. I suggest to combine a trip with Carlsbad Cavern since it about 40 miles southwest.There is no gas station here.

We went on a sunny day and there were no winds, but we were told that the hike can grow remarkably challenging with strong winds. I recommend hiking poles for the way down as some of the rocks can shift beneath your feet. Bring plenty of water/Gatorade and snack bars.

This is a rough trail which the park service suggests taking 6 to 8 hours to complete. Not being in the best of shape, it took me 9 hours - 5 hours up and 4 hours back - for this 4.2 miles / 3,000 foot elevation change each way. There are a lot of steps along the way made of stone and logs - my Fitbit counted a total of 3,160.I took a 3-liter camelback of water and ended running out still a mile from the trailhead on the way back. Make sure you have enough for the whole trip.I started the trail at 10:30 AM and most people on the trail were ahead of me. I did meet a few people that were on the way down already while I was in the second mile on the way up. In total, I met about 30 people on their way back while I did the 4.2 miles on the way up. Most of the trail is easy to follow until the last 1/4 mile. At times, it was difficult to decide the direction it was supposed to go until you notice scruff marks from previous visitors.By the time I made it to the summit, I was concerned with being able to get off the mountain before dark. I took quite a few photos and signed the summit register. As I was getting ready to start back down, a couple more hikers arrived at the top. After taking pictures for one of them, and talking for a few minutes, I started back down the trail. Both of them passed me in the first couple of miles going down.The sun was setting during the last hour on the mountain.

Guadalupe Peak,"In late December 2014 my husband, our 18 year old son and 22 year old daughter, and I hiked the Guadalupe Peak trail. The trail is very rocky and can be challenging in the best conditions, but that day there was a layer of ice on almost every surface, which made it extremely treacherous. Our children made it to the peak, but we parents stopped our ascent shortly after the bridge, as we didn't want to risk falling on the increasingly slippery surfaces and exposed sharp rocks. Our children assured us that we would not have made it to the peak due to all of the ice. My husband and I (56 and 55 years old) returned in early October 2015 and were successful in hiking to the peak. We are both in very good shape, but each have a bad knee due to old ski and football injuries, and found that trekking poles were extremely helpful, especially on the descent. The weather on the October day that we chose was perfect for the hike; there had been thunderstorms the previous day, but we hiked under clear skies and fairly light wind. The views along the way were spectacular. There were swiftly moving clouds occasionally blocking our view from the peak, but it was beautiful nonetheless. I highly recommend sturdy, broken-in hiking boots as the trail is very rough with loose rocks of varying sizes and shapes. It would be very easy to injure feet and ankles if one is not well prepared. Plan to wear a pack with, at minimum, 3 - 4 liters of water per person, a first aid kit, extra layer of clothing, snacks and lip balm with sunscreen. Plan to start early in the day to take advantage of cool temps and as many hours of daylight as you can possibly manage...you will likely want to allow time for photo ops along the way.

Guadalupe Peak,"My 11 year old daughter and I wanted to summit the highest point in Texas, but being not especially fit, we also knew to prepare well (food, water, bug spray) just in case. First, the hike: I am very grateful I brought along the walking stick. There are portions of the trail that are relatively steep and rocky and it definitely made it easier. The trail has three stages - hot (we went at the end of June) and steep, cool and conifer, windy and rocky. So many different biomes, and plant and animal variations depending upon what altitude level you were! The coolest thing when we went was the swarms of LADYBUGS at the top! Apparently, they mate up there in the summer and every imaginable living surface (trees, bushes, etc.) had thousands of them coating the branches and leaves. When we finally reached the top it was truly a reward to our perseverance and we were treated to incredible views of El Capitan, the surrounding countryside and the nearby Salt Flats (that look like a lake off to the SW). Preparation: We each packed about 1/2 gallon of water, beef jerky, lots of fruit snacks and crackers and were very happy we did. Nobody is any fun when they're hangry, and it's a LOT of work, this climb, so best to keep the troops happy. We were also glad we took bug spray, because those ladybugs bite. We threw a whistle onto a carabiner just in case, along with a small first aid kit in the pack. The two things that I am most grateful that we packed, however, were the extra layer of clothes and a $7 mylar blanket. We got caught in a thunder/lightning/rain storm that blew up suddenly about two hours into our trek and decided that we could go neither up nor down and to shelter in place. We found some low pine bushes and hunkered down and rode out the storm for two hours until we could move on. The blanket was extremely good at keeping us warm and dry despite its flimsy thin appearance and I was so happy we had it. All in all, the trip took us 10 hours: 5 hours up, 2 hours waiting out the storm, and 3 hours down. My feet were destroyed, so be sure you have great shoes and cushiony socks. But I wouldn't change a thing, because I learned so much about myself on that hike. It really is just about putting one foot in front of the other and moving forward.","October 8, 2015","An incredible experience, but be prepared",10,"Austin, Texas",5

Guadalupe Peak,"The hike was harder than the reviews suggested, mainly because of erosion that requires large step ups, and more importantly, when returning, step downs of more than a foot that also have you stepping onto loose, slippery rock. If you hike in warm weather, take at least two liters of water per person and keep well hydrated. All five in our group got to the summit and back safely, and four of us were in our 60s and 70s with limited hiking experience. The views from the summit were breathtaking. There were hundreds of thousands of ladybugs on the small trees and plants on and near the summit. Put your cameras down after taking a few pictures and take in the vistas with your eyes, not a lens.

We went on July 4th, 2015.At the top, about 100 feet to the right of the marker (east of the marker), there is the largest tree on the summit. It's kind of a bush, but still is the largest plant up there. Walk around it and look for an opening into it's trunk. When we did, we saw hundreds of thousands of lady bugs (see pics). Other bushes up at the top were filled with them as well, but this was the biggest concentration.Enjoy your trip, it's well worth it.","July 6, 2015",Lady Bugs in the Hundreds of Thousands,279,"Houston, Texas",5
Guadalupe Peak,"4.2 miles each way. 3,000 vertical feet to the summit. You may feel it for some time afterward. It's grueling. But this is an incredible hike in an incredible place. My second time to summit and took my daughter for her first. If you have the time, take it. We broke no speed records and enjoyed a ton of photos of the plants, flowers, birds, butterflies, ladybugs, and scenery. The ladybugs gather in piles around 8,000' +/- depending upon the season. We hiked in the middle of June. There were far more in August last time I went up. Saw a small snake on the trail, too.The summit views are incredible. The feeling of rising above all the surrounding mountains, trails, etc. is exhilarating. The feeling at the top is amazing. Bring a LOT of water and some sports drinks for electrolytes. Think how much you'd really use on a HOT day. Then double it. Once you leave the bathrooms at the trail head there is no water. Start early - pre-dawn if possible -- as much of the first part of the trail is unshaded. And you'll be up higher as the temperatures rise. It gets cooler as you climb. Bring sunscreen, hat, and sunglasses.Although one of the most strenuous hike's I've ever done, I find this one to be one of the most rewarding. Do a little research on the mountains before you go. Keep an eye out for fossils along the way. Take your time and take it all in and enjoy it.

Guadalupe Peak,"I was going to go to the caves near Carlsbad. But I got fed up because it said they weren't open, so I looked for something else to do. I must pause at this stage and tell you that this review is just a personal review and probably won't reflect your own experience, but if it does, well perhaps you will enjoy it as much as I did.I am 49 years young. I smoke, and do a minimum of physical activities. But I still consider myself fairly fit. This bloody mountain nearly killed me. It was a hot day in may, and on the advice from someone in a bar last night, I decided to give it a go. When I got there, it is a bit difficult trying to find the start of it. Don't ask the advice from the woman in the entrance shop/hut, because the advice she gave me was just to turn right from the entrance and go down the road for a mile where you will find it. No...you don't leave the entrance, you just follow the road round. Anyway, I eventually got to the bottom where I discovered that you pay five dollars and leave your car and some personal details on a bit of paper and post it in a metal box....something's going on here....I looked up and thought ""well, it doesn't look too bad"". Ha ha ha ha..... Little did I knowI set off. Ten minutes later I was struggling for breath. Ten minutes. God I was unfit. Then I got passed by a group of three very fit looking young women who seemed to float up out of my distance. It was depressing. So I stopped again and gathered my thoughts. Should I really be doing this....? The hours slipped by, and the top seemed always to be out of reach. Then I met a guy who was really struggling. A veteran of Afghanistan, who had damaged knees. He was a great inspiration to me, even though he will probably not agree with me. I carried on, the mountain became harder and harder. At times it is sheer drops either side of where you are walking. It was harder than anything I had ever done. My sister used to do a lot of walking but ever since (2 days ago) she had been diagnosed with cancer, obviously it would not be possible. I did it for her, and I did it for my dad who had passed away last year. When I got to the top, having passed the three fit women, it is, was, will be, the most amazing site I have ever seen. I stayed at the top for a good hour. You will too. Sign a bit of paper and put it in the box. The metal box at the top. Was it spiritual? For me it was. I'm not really that religious... But it made me think.... The Afghanistan veteran, didn't make it, but I really hope he gives it another go. Of all the people who should do it, he should. I am sure he will. He promised me he would Here is a picture of one of the views.Only try this mountain if you do a great deal of walking. I don't, and it very nearly finished me offBut it is worth it.","June 4, 2015",It is an experience you will never forget,59,,5

Guadalupe Peak,"Hike to Guadalupe Peak is on a rocky, constant up, switchback, high altitude trail that requires time, water and weather conscious! Wear good boots, take extra water (more than you think you will need), allow extra time as the altitude can cause dizziness and light headed. It is definitely worth the 3,000 feet elevation gain to see the top of Texas but remember you must come back down and I always find coming down is harder on feet!

Guadalupe Peak,"I've been wanting to attempt a mountain summit, so when I read about this one and being the highest point in Texas, I figured it'd be easy enough. All I can say is that I'm glad I read these reviews/stories. The trail is as every bit tough as some people make it out to be. Don't underestimate it. For someone from sealevel used to dirt trails, this was quite a shock. Pretty much the entire trail is on rock. The first hour or so is straight up via switchbacks, in the sun. If I had started much later than 6am, I don't know if I would have made it. It was chilly that early in the morning but I didn't need the jacket for long. It's a pretty strenuous climb so I shed the jacket quickly, but wore it again at the top and partly coming down mainly to protect from the sun since I was wearing short sleeves underneath. It was cooler at the top but not a drastic drop. I'd say 65 at the base parking area and 55 at the peak on this April day. Weather does make a huge difference however. I passed by on Saturday and it was really windy, too windy. On Sunday, I was doing other things but saw dark clouds by the mountain. Not sure if they actually had thunderstorms or if it was just cloudy. By Monday though, the weather was perfect. And it was not any windier at the peak than at the base. Honestly, if you can take your time and make it through the initial straight up switchback portion, then you've got a decent chance. The middle third of the trail isn't nearly as bad although there are a few places where you have to step up quite high to continue (imagine climbing stairs but skipping two or three or even four steps at a time). You also can't have a fear of heights because there are a few places with cliffs that if you look the wrong way, you almost get a sense of vertigo. Also, once you pass the bridge, you start to get pretty exposed quick. If you make it to the bridge, then you definitely should make it, but don't over do it. The final push up to the top gets pretty darn tricky if you ask me. It's almost like scaling rock and I felt I needed an extra hand so I left my extra canteen I was carrying at a spot before scaling up to the peak. The perception at this point is that you still have quite a ways to go but if you get to this part, then you're practically there. It really isn't that much further, but be careful. Too easy to slip and fall here. But once you reach the peak, it's worth all the hard work. Best feeling I've had yet. I left at 6:15 and arrived four hours later at the peak, alone. I spent 45 minutes on top and then started back, passing about 18 people coming up on the way down. Probably could have come down in 2 hours if I hadn't stopped to talk so much but I didn't mind. I only stopped coming down to rest/water towards the bottom because it got hot in the sun. A lot of the middle third of the trail has various trees and some coverage. As far as water, unless you're experienced or it's winter, pack more than you think. I ended up packing 4-16oz water bottles, i started off with one opened, and carried a canteen that held another two bottles worth, so about 7 bottles overall. I drank 5 of them over the course of the trip. I drank the last two quickly once back to the car. Yeah, the trip is tiring. But I made it back down by around 1:30. Best advice, start early to avoid as much sun and as much thunderstorms as possible. Also, take your time. Plan on it taking a good four hours to reach the top and you'll at least make it without dehydrating yourself and hating it. You can pay in a box before or there will probably be an envelope on your car afterwards. There's also a ledger book to sign in and out. I totally forgot to sign out. Damn! Hope no one went to look for me. :)And of course there's the ledger up on the peak. Gotta sign that.","April 23, 2015",First mountain summit,63,"Baton Rouge, Louisiana",5

It is a very hard two miles and carrying 3 gallons of water along with camping gear made it very tough. I would suggest even more water than the Gallon per day they recommend. The back country campsites are not well maintained but they pads are pretty good. The terrain is pretty rugged in some places with lots of loose rock and steep climbs.

Guadalupe Peak,"We spent 4 days exploring Guadalupe Mountains National Park, and it was marvelous. The area is quite isolated, but incredibly stunning. My favorite trails were in McKittrick Canyon. We did hike to the peak, and although it's challenging, it's worth it! The first and last parts of the trail are the worst. The first section has infinite switchbacks, and the final chunk was miserable because clouds rolled in. We had no idea where the peak actually was, and we kept thinking ""We made it!"" only to realize we had another 30 minutes to go. The last few switchbacks are rough, but like I said, it's worth it. The clouds cleared up for a few good pictures, the views were stunning, and we got to put our names in the book! It took us (2 active twenty-somethings) about 5.5 hours roundtrip as we didn't stop much on the way up. My parents (mid 50s) took right around 6 hours roundtrip. We were glad it was our last day in the park because we were pretty sore the next day.I'd definitely recommend trying the peak trail.

Guadalupe Peak,"my husband with a 4 year-old on his back some of the way, so can you, so don't be intimidated!! My husband and I did this hike with our 3 kids as part of a spring break trip!! The weather the day we did it (March 15th) was perfect--mid 60's with only an occasional brisk breeze. We wore layered clothing, and everyone kept comfortable. We also carried 3 back packs with water, snacks, rain hear (though there was not a cloud in the sky all day long), first aid kit, etc. My daughter (4 1/2) did most of the hiking on her own, but my husband carried her in a piggyback rider for the more difficult, rugged portions. I would not even recommend attempting it with a child 5 or younger without one (or something similar). I recommend a Kelty carrier for kids 1-3 years (depending on size). We arrived at the park at 8 am so our kids could earn their Jr. Ranger badges before we started out. We started from the trailhead about 10 am and got back around 5 pm. The hike up and down took us approximately 7 hours with frequent stops for snack breaks and rock inspections (gotta keep the kids happy and interested). The first mile and half up is the hardest and most challenging part, imo (4 year-old did this part mostly on her own though). The trip down was a piece of cake, though I think it would be really hard on your feet without proper shoes. We loved this ""adventure"" and what an awesome memory!! Just make sure kids stay to the inside of the trail in the areas with steep drop offs and take careful, good steps as legs tire (it's easy to trip on rugged terrain with tired legs). I want to make a return trip and do this hike again!! This is just an all around awesome and fun day hike with stunning scenery and an awesome pay-off. It is also challenging enough to give a real sense of accomplishment for adults and children alike! My 10 year-old and 8 year-old really had no problem at all--I think it may have been easier for them than me! ;-) When we started out, we didn't know if we'd make it all the way to the top, so glad we did!The trail was pretty busy, especially on the way up, and so was the summit, which on the bright side, meant there were plenty of awesome, friendly stangers we could bug to snap a family photo, but on the downside, hard to take photos without strangers in the background. P.S. My kids hiked Harney Peak last July, and this hike was definitely more difficult for them. I don't think Harney Peak (or Sunday Gulch) even challenged the older two, but this hike definitely did.

Guadalupe Peak,"Guadalupe Peak and the whole park in general is a wonder of geology; an ancient reef which makes up the view you see from the highway. The peak itself is like a geology lesson, every few minutes of hiking, you can look at the mountain side and see something ancient and different. The hike itself is a pretty good workout. The first part of it is the hardest. Once you are up the first side of the mountain, you reach the tree line. From then until the final half mile or so, you are generally shaded. About 3\4 mike from the summit, there is a primitive camp. The next time I do this, I will stay at this camp the night before and make an early summit.I brought 1 gallon of water, but didn't even finish it. In October it is very pleasant.

The rangers were very helpful with information regarding the various hiking trails. We first hiked the McKittrick Canyon which was an easy 5 mile hike roundtrip with some beautiful fall foliage still visible. The next day we hiked to the Guadalupe Peak. The rangers advised us to be careful due to the 50 mph wind gusts that day...this hike is classified as strenuous and the winds did make the hike more difficult. We hit the trail at 9:00 a.m. and took several bottles of water and snacks along with our hiking sticks which proved to be beneficial due to the wind gusts. The first mile is the toughest because it is the steepest. I would suggest wearing layers as your body temperature from hiking as well as the air temperature does change throughout the hike...there was a little snow on the ground.

Energy bars are perfect. 8.4 miles took 7 1/2 hours. We didn't rush it. You have to watch every step as it has loose rocks and is steep and drops off at many locations. The campground was full, but we didn't stay overnight. Carlsbad is only 50 miles away if you need a hotel. Nice bathrooms at the bottom. I'll be returning with another group of ladies who were so jealous seeing the pictures that now they have to make the trek. There are 3 other trails in the park, some shorter, some longer. I've done the McKittrick Canyon and it is much shorter but prettier view of fall foliage & a spring fed creek.","November 9, 2014",Highest Peak in Texas! Great Girls' Trip!,3,"Midland, Texas",5
Guadalupe Peak,"I've done this hike twice, both times heading up the mountain in the VERY EARLY (4 or 5) morning in order to see the sunrise from the top. Wear a headlamp and try it. It is an awesome, and tough, hike and the views from the top are great. The views are amazing in all directions: west over the gypsum salt flats, south over the rolling hills with the deep shadows cast with the morning golden light, east with the colors of sunrise (and, unfortunately, a great number of fracking oil fields) and north viewing the El Capitan reef system. Highly recommended if you are in shape and ready for adventure.","November 3, 2014",Gorgeous Views from the Top of Texas,39,,5
Guadalupe Peak,"This little visited park, about 3 hours of a desert drive from El Paso and just a half hour before Carlsbad Caverns National Park, is a gem. While there are no roads through the park you can see amazing landscapes right from the visitor's center and the road leading to it. There is amazing hiking through the canyons and mountains, and due to the altitude, it is not as hot as El Paso. On your way to Carlsbad, do yourself a favor and stop here for a while. You will be so glad you did visit this highest point in Texas, hard on the new Mexico border.","October 29, 2014",A GEM!,107,"Marietta, Georgia",5
Guadalupe Peak,"If you’re a novice hiker with scrawny, tooth pick legs such as mine, I highly recommend doing some training a few months prior to this hike. I’ve embarked on numerous day hikes on the west coast, the hill country, and overseas, equivalent in distance, perhaps even more; however, the Guadalupe Peak Trail has been my most challenging. Even after reading about this hike, I had this misconception that it would be a gravel trail for most of the trek. I wore inadequate hiking boots better suited for walking on sandstone and smaller pebbles…but they were terrible on the large chunks of rocks on the very uneven path. Often I had to watch each step to avoid twisting my lankles (lanky ankles). Thank goodness I was “gellin;” because if I hadn’t my feet would have succumbed to blistering. Get some hiking boots with some thick tread, and wear some hiking socks (might take a second pair). If you’re an avid hiker, or have done many a marathons in your life and have legs of steel, much like the friend who accompanied me, and left me in the dust for most of the hike, then you’ll be fine. It was a sunny, cool morning during this first Friday in October. Not a cloud in the sky to break the gentle rays of sun illuminating the Guadalupe Mountains. The friendly park ranger in the visitor’s center mentioned the area is greener than usual, due to the unseasonable amount of rain from the prior month. So I felt fortunate. The drive getting there from El Paso had been more picturesque than I had ever imagined. I intended to begin the hike about 90 minutes earlier, but I was patient in accommodating the needs of my friend who joined me on this venture, last minute. The ascent seems to begin almost immediately. Regretfully, I started my hiking app to measure the distance about ten or fifteen minutes into the hike. The first switchbacks were really tough, especially as I struggled to keep up with my friend, who I’ll refer to as Marathon Marty. I’d fall behind, even more as I’d stop to photograph my surroundings, catch my breath, sip some water, and let my gaze be arrested by the vast Texas horizon opening up around me. It is so awe inspiring to think it was all beneath the sea so long ago. Frequently I’d find myself completely alone, and the only sounds were the rustling of the brush, whistling of the subtle breezes, and at times, even the pounding of my own heartbeat. Much to my dismay, I gathered my travel companion seemed to focus on the destination, rather than the journey. Once in a while he’d slow down, allow me to catch up, we’d exchange a few words, and within just a few minutes I’d be alone again. After enduring the many switchbacks on the first rocky and brushy slope, we finally reached the forested area: So perfectly quite, so enchantingly serene. Alone with my thoughts, I pondered whether or not I could complete this journey. I began to have intermittent cramping on my thighs and calves around the four mile mark (or at least according to my app). I admit I have some medical challenges. Had I told my doctor about this excursion, she might have advised against it, or perhaps just urged me to take my time. Unwise, I know; but I’m stubborn. This medical challenge has allowed me to see life in a new light, how fleeting it can be, how each moment is all the more precious…so, come hell or high water, and as God as my witness, I was going to make it to the peak if I had to crawl up on bloody hands and knees. When my app announced that I had passed the four mile mark, I thought that summit would be right around the corner. I kept on trekking, thinking, “well, surely I must be close.” Sometime after crossing the bridge, I realized that either my usually reliable app was not functioning as it should, or the mileage listed on the brochure is inaccurate. The app announced that I was at the five mile mark; however, I still hadn’t reached the summit. Keep in mind, the brochure says the hike, round trip, is 8.4 miles. After a few more switchbacks, nearing the summit, I passed a hearty sixty year old woman resting on a rock, walking stick in hand, her eyes keenly captivated by the imposing view of El Capitan. Her husband, about ten yards up the trail, stood facing her with a subtle hint of concern in his eyes, encouraged her to continue on. They were the only two people I passed the entire length of the hike. Once I stepped on the peak, haggard, exhausted, mildly agitated, I felt a fleeting sense of accomplishment. My friend sat comfortably, waiting to take humorous jabs at my health, getting a kick out of my utter exhaustion and failure to keep up…reminding me that a sixty year old couple is managing just fine. There was a younger couple with about a ten year old son already at the summit having a picnic, and behind a bush, a young lone adventurer indulged in a siesta on a rock. I threw down my back pack, sat down on my own rock, and for a few minutes just relaxed to let the moment resonate. The view, as expected, is spectacular. I devoured a dry protein bar, chased by some coconut water that Marathon Marty convinced me to drink in order subdue the muscle cramps in my legs. I forced myself to drink about half a bottle before not being able to stomach the taste anymore. Too drained to write anything profound, I just wrote, “I made it!” followed by my name, in the summit register stored in the ammunition box that lay beside monument. We took photographs rather quickly. I imagined how majestic the view at sunset and sunrise must be, and in that moment I regretted not having the opportunity to be able to camp on the mountain in order to see it. The day was so clear and cloudless, the temperature so perfect. I felt a slight resurgence of energy, momentarily hoping time would allow the Devils Hall trail. By the time we returned to the eastern slope where the Devil’s Hall trail began, the sun slowly descended to the west, and the mountain cast its foreboding shadow over the ravine that the trail meanders through. Aside from that, my feet were ready to fall off. For most of the way down, I was alone yet again, while my Sherpa friend scaled the mountain with ease. I felt like this must be how those contestants on the biggest loser feel. Here I am, my scrawny self, trying to keep up with Sherpa Gillian, less the yelling guised as encouragement. My toes became increasingly tender and sore during our descent, as the downward angle of my stepping forced them to constantly rub against the tips of my shoes. My back ached, my neck ached more. My eyes were fixated on every step I took, because I knew if I took just one wrong one, sustained one ankle injury, I’d be up the creek without a paddle. My ankles kept twisting as my body wanted to surrender to the fatigue…but I had to hurry, I had to keep up. When the parking lot below appeared close, I refrained from being excited. With all the switchbacks that lingered on before me, it felt more like a cruel mirage. In many areas of the hike, the trail is narrow, and the drops, steep. This is more evident on the way down. By the time I approached the entry point, my friend cheered me on in an almost gleefully condescending manor. I’m quite surprised he didn’t think to get in the rental Van, slide its doors wide open, and blast the “Chariots of Fire” theme song to taunt me. It was, after all, the song I was hearing in my head. My body was so drained, I couldn’t even muster the strength to jokingly jog in slow motion, and bask in my moment of glory, like in a scene in the aforementioned movie. My phone died the moment my bum collapsed onto the curb of the parking lot. I gazed around me…and all I could think about was embarking upon my next adventure. After sitting on the curb a few minutes, I noticed I almost sat down on a piece of prickly pear still bearing some thorns, less than a foot away. I awarded Marathon Marty, by handing him the keys to drive the bus I rented that he wasn’t too fond of. I chose a special, where the rental company picks the vehicle at a really good deal. They gave me a huge van. My friend wanted me to exchange it at first, but I could care less. It’s a vehicle, and I got it cheap. I reserved a room at the historically charming Hotel El Capitan in Van Horn, about sixty miles south of the peak. Heading southbound on highway 54 during sunset is a scenic experience worthy of your time, offering the view of a wall of mountains on the western side (that I believe used to be an underwater shelf in the Delaware Basin millions of years ago), and rolling hills to the east. Once my phone charged, I pulled up the hiking app. The hike took us 5 hours and 35 minutes, with a change in elevation of 2,745 feet each way. If we include the amount of time we rested at the summit, it was 6 hours and eight minutes. Had my lack of physical agility not slowed my Sherpa down, I’m confident he could have done it much quicker. I, on the other hand, would have rather taken a full eight hours and spent more time photographing and observing. This will be an adventure I will do again…but next time I will be better prepared. I hoped this excursion would have given me a miniscule foreshadowing of what the three day Inca Trail hike might be like up to the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu, which is another trip on my bucket list. After this experience, I think it’s wise for my scrawny lanky self to take the train up to Machu Picchu: but who knows, when that time comes, I’m likely to change my mind and opt for the hike. So much to see!","October 25, 2014",A Beautiful Adventure...But Be Prepared,86,"Dallas, Texas",5

Very beautiful, the scenery changes so much, it's lovely stopping every so often on a ridge for a snack and an amazing view, they're endless up there. The hike down is quick and easy, would like to come back and camp on the halfway site, looked incredible for a one night stop! The trails are very apparent and we ran into very few people while hiking, even made a new friend with whom we still keep in touch with! Wonderful memories of this gorgeous mountain.

Guadalupe Peak,"I've driven past the peak too many times to count. Decided to hike the trail to the top at the request of a family member. The national park site states that it will take between 6-8 hours to complete- we did it in 7. It also lists it as strenuous- and I'll totally agree with that assessment! Took us 4 hours to reach the peak- and we made it down in three. The first and last mile are the roughest. The very last part really isn't much of a trail, especially if you have short legs like me!

Guadalupe Peak,"You might wonder why someone with a spacial challenge would consent to hike this mountain. Well, I did my internet research and looked at all the online pictures with children hiking the trail and thought it can't be that bad. I did make it to about the 8000 ft region but had to call it quits ( the last 20 min. you are above the tree line and it is all ""open space""((My husband finished the hike so that is my time frame)) For me, It was a struggle all the way up. The Park Service had just opened the Guad Peak trail because of the heavy rains in the area and parts of the trail had small rock slides.The trail is Steep, Strenuous, with Shear rocky drops of I would just guess maybe 300 feet or more. It is a beautiful hike but if heights are an issue this might not be the place for you. As one fellow hiker said, ""For God sakes you are on a mountain after all""... and believe me, You won't be able to forget it! I'm not saying don't go but don't let those pictures of children fool you. It is a challenge and for those of you out to test your ""fear"" just be cautious. Side note: We took about a gallon and half of water and used almost all of it. Only needed a couple of energy bars. Changing socks helped with foot issues. And finally, we did see two snakes on the trail and one was a rattlesnake (this one we met on the last third of the trail on the way down).

Guadalupe Peak,I recently visited Guadalupe Mountains National Park (August 2014) I had read many reviews online and decided that my trip to New Mexico/ Texas would include this National Park. What an amazing place! Myself and my Sister's boyfriend hiked Guadalupe Peak which is the tallest peak in Texas. We were not disappointed with the spectacular views this hike has to offer. We started our hike around 930 am. We made a complete hike in 4 hours and 55 minutes with many breaks and a stop at the summit for rest and pictures. We are both in our mid-to-late twenties in decent shape and had some difficulties with this hike.The first hour is by far the most strenuous. Once you get past the initial hour and switch backs where you gain a good portion of altitude it becomes a more manageable hike. Don't give up! The views you will see hiking up to the summit are majestic and breath taking. This hike is one of the most rewarding and amazing experiences I have had. I am terrified of heights ( I live at sea level) I was only anxious with the heights once we were approaching the summit. Be sure to drink a lot of water and hydrate the night before. I drank 100 oz or 3 Liters of water from a camelbak for the duration of this hike as did my friend. Excellent park.

Also, the humidity is very low, so take at least twice as much water that you think you will need. You can stash part of it half way up the trail, and retrieve it on your way down.

Guadalupe Peak,"Guadalupe Peak is in the Guadalupe Mountains National Park, located in quite a remote part of Texas. But it's definitely worth the drive and I am of the belief every avid outdoors person in Texas should hike to the top of Texas to check it off their bucket list. Because of my travel schedule earlier in the day, I wasn't able to start until 2 in the afternoon in late May (temps were in the low 90s). You definitely want to start in the cooler early morning hours if possible. The first 45 minutes of the hike is the hardest. After that, I got in a good groove and made it to the top in just under 2 hours. I took my time coming down (and took lots of pics). The entire hike took me 4.5 hours. The park rangers say it takes 6-8...I would agree and recommend this as a good pace, but if you are in good shape and the weather is favorable, a quicker summit is doable.

Guadalupe Peak,"I recently (April 2014) visited Guadalupe Mountains National Park which is only about 25 miles from Carlsbad Caverns National Park. While at the park, I completed two hikes. The first hike was to Guadalupe Peak which is the highest peak in Texas at 8749 feet elevation. The trailhead is roughly 5861 feet, so there is a nearly 3000 foot vertical gain over the 4.1 mile hike to the summit (8.25 miles roundtrip). For me, the hike took about 4 hours for the roundtrip and I probably spent a good half hour taking pictures and talking to people on the summit. I would rate the uphill portion of the hike moderate to strenuous and the return trip easy. At the summit, the 360 degree panoramic view of the countryside (you look down on El Capitan!) was amazing. Besides being a fantastic hike, I met a lot of friendly people from all parts of America. Be sure to bring plenty of water for the hike. I hiked in the middle of April and the warm temperatures, coupled with the low humidity and the strenuous activity, led me to drink a lot of water. I brought approximately 6 liters of water with me, and drank close to 4 liters. After completing the Guadalupe Trail, I followed the recommendation of a fellow hiker to try the Devil's Hall Trail. The hike was about 4 miles roundtrip. The first part of the trail is relatively easy and then you enter a dry, rocky wash where you have to work your way around boulders and rocks that were left behind by I assume a flash flood. Near the end of the trail, you arrive at ""Devil's Hall"" , which is a narrow slot canyon. To enter the canyon, you ascend the ""Hiker's Staircase"" a natural rock stairway formed by thin layers of Sedimentary Rock. The hike takes roughly 1.5 hours or so. I found that this park exceeded my expectations and the next time I visit, I will be sure to spend more than one day in its exploration.","May 28, 2014",Close to Carlsbad Caverns,223,"Wallingford, Connecticut",5

I left El Paso around 7:15 am and the high temperature was supposed to be 63 there. The temperature on the mountain was 5-10 degrees cooler at the trail head and about 15 degrees cooler at the summit. In addition, the wind was pretty steady making good shell pants and top a necessity. I'm a very experienced mountain climber, I think discussions of exposure in other posts are exaggerated. There was snow and ice. Keep that in mind if you go up during winter months. Taking easy on and off traction devises would have been extremely helpful. I only passed 5 other hikers and one had fallen twice on the ice. He was a bit shuck-up.I hit the trail head at 10:40 am. and was back the the parking lot before 3 pm. And I stopped for pictures.

Guadalupe Peak,"The Guadalupe Peak hike is definitely worth doing! The trail itself is spectacular because it winds around the edges of the mountain, giving you a view of the bottom for most of the hike. Prepare for the weather. We hiked it in late December and most of the trail was covered in snow and ice, making it very slippery, particularly on the way down. It was also very windy, so dress in lots of layers to stay warm to spend some time at the top and enjoy the view. My two teenage sons and I were so cold at the peak we didn't want to stick around too long. Gloves are definitely a good idea if you do this in the winter. I'm 51 and consider myself in moderate shape and the hike was definitely challenging. It probably would have been better to stop and take more breaks but I was trying to keep up with my sons. If I had to do it over again, I would've trained more. It took us about 3.5 hours to reach the peak, and about 2 hours to hike down. It would have been faster going down if we didn't take it slow through the icy spots.

I made many stops for picture breaks. This is a very strenuous hike and the first mile and a half was the most difficult for me. After the first mile and a half the hike becomes easier but I would not consider it easy by any means. The views are absolutely spectacular and be sure to have a camera with you. The view from the peak is the best part of the hike. When i hiked to the peak it was an clear day and I could probably see for 60 miles in any direction with a 360 degree view from the top. There is a log book you can sign at the peak. It only took me about an hour and a half to get back down and the trip down is much easier. The temperature was around 80 degrees at the beginning of the hike and there was probably about a 15 degree change in temperature at the peak. Be sure to go during the fall, winter, or spring months because the summer temps would probably make this hike that much more difficult. Also don't forget to wear some good sunscreen.

I had seen a news article of two men climbing to the top of the tallest peak in Texas- Guadalupe Peak,and so that became the goal. We trained at the gym, mainly the stair-stepper, and in November we drove out to Guadalupe Mountain National Park. It was the week, just before Thanksgiving, when terrible weather struck the area. To make the story short, we made it. We met a wonderful family- husband, wife, 13 year old daughter, and 9 year old son- who we joined all the way to the top. It was all a fantastic experience that we will never forget. Don't try it without proper training !","November 30, 2013",Still Crazy After All These Years !,112,"Kingwood, Texas",5

Guadalupe Peak,"My wife and I hiked Guadalupe Peak and it took us about 8 1/2 - 9 hours to go to the summit and back, inclusive of spending about 30-40 minutes at the summit for lunch and various breaks along the way. Since we hiked in mid-August, I made sure that we got an early morning start to try to get as much of the trail and elevation behind us as possible before the heat of the day really set in. Because we arrived well before the visitor center opened, the first thing we did upon arriving at the parking lot for the trailhead to the summit (which is different than the parking lot for the visitor center) was to pay the daily use fee in cash. There is a collection box and envelopes available for paying the fee at the large information board located near the start of the trailhead. We placed the receipt from the envelope on the dash of our car to evidence our payment of the fee. The fee is small and goes towards maintaining the Park.The first 1 to 1 1/2 miles of the hike are on an east facing slope with a substantial elevation gain and lots of switchbacks; I consider this to be the most strenuous part of the hike. Even with an early start, the sun really started to heat up this portion of the hike well before we reached the crest of the ridge which marked the top of the switchbacks. I had to stop and put on a very lightweight, ventilated long sleeved shirt and smear sunblock on the rest of my exposed skin to protect against sunburn. Once we reached the crest of the ridge and the end of the first set of switchbacks, there was a very nice view looking back at the parking lot and towards Carlsbad. The cars in the parking lot looked tiny. As we continued along the trail, there were also great views of other mountains in the park and the trails going up those mountains. I used the trails on the other mountains to give me some sense of how much higher we would have to climb as well as to gauge how high we had already climbed. After the initial switchbacks, the next several miles are a much more gradual ascent. The trail was wide enough so that even in a few sections where there was a fairly steep dropoff on the downward slope, there was never any cause for alarm or concern. And despite it being August, there were enough trees and shade so that the temperature was not a problem. In this more moderate section and as we got closer to the summit, we also came upon a wooden bridge that we had to cross, but the bridge was very stout and well maintained. After the trail turnoff for the campsite (which is about 3/4 to a mile from the summit), the last portion of the hike starts to ascend more steeply with the return of switchbacks. Although this last section of the trail starts in the trees, we quickly came out of the trees and encountered fairly open terrain the rest of the way to the summit. The most sobering part of the trail involves a 90 degree turn around a rocky outcrop with an almost sheer and substantial drop off just a few feet away. This portion of the trail would definitely cause problems to anyone who suffers from acrophobia. However, from this point on, the summit is not that far and our views were of the back topside of El Capitan and of many miles of the countryside some 3,000 feet below us extending to the south. Needless to say, the views from this point to the summit were absolutely stunning and breathtaking. At the summit, we encountered a park ranger, a handful of other hikers, and the stainless steel American Airlines monument. There is also a small metal container which contains a book which we signed with a few notes and then put back in the container for the next hiker to sign. As we like to do, we ate our lunch at the summit and spent about 30-40 minutes relaxing, taking pictures, and chatting with the ranger and other hikers. We might have stayed a little longer at the summit, but in other parts of the Park to the north and west of us, we could see rain and lightning so everyone on the summit, ranger included, decided it was time to head back down. The hike down was much faster than going up and would have been fairly uneventful except with a mile or so to go, the sole on one of my wife's hiking boots decided to start to separate from the boot. Fortunately, in the first aid kit which I always take when hiking, I had enough tape to secure the sole to the rest of her boot.This is a strenuous hike and not something to take lightly. It took us essentially all day to go up and back down. The trail is rocky the whole distance so a good and comfortable pair of hiking boots is highly recommended. I also can't emphasize enough that one should be well provisioned with water, food, and other essentials before embarking on this hike. Hiking in the sun and temperature in August (which although warm was actually not at all oppressive on the day we hiked) requires plenty of hydration and there are no water sources available along the trail to and from the summit. I took up a gallon and a pint of water and came back down with less than a pint and my wife took up a gallon of water and consumed all but about a cup's worth. In addition, the rain gear we always carry came in handy the last 1/2 mile of the hike as the rain finally made its way to Guadalupe Peak.Although Guadalupe Mountains National Park has a variety of wildlife, we did not see anything larger than some squirrels during our hike. However, considering that most of the hike was well after the time when one usually spots the larger mammal species and the harshness of the terrain which limits the number of animals per acre, I was not surprised by our lack of wildlife sightings.In addition to enjoying the gorgeous views, when we reached the summit, we achieved standing at the top of Texas, which is something only relatively few of America's (and Texas') population will ever do.","October 3, 2013",Hiking to the Top of Texas,23,"Houston, Texas",5
Guadalupe Peak,"A friend and I went on this hike with my son (11) as I was looking for a challenging overnight hike. We arrived at the park around 2 pm on Friday and started the climb by 3 pm - it took us almost 4 hours to get to the campsite but the adults were carrying 50 pound packs and my son also had a pack - the weight was excessive since we were carrying 2-3 gallons of water each. The campsite is basic but the views are amazing - the stars at night were great and this is the highest campsite in Texas. The next morning we went to the peak and spent time with some of the first people up the trail that morning. Then, back to the campsite to pack up and were down to the bottom by 5 pmIf you like camping I would recommend this opportunity - keep in mind that the campsite is 3/4 of the way up and over 200 yards off the trail.I would agree with those who talked about there being several spots on the trail that are potentially dangerous especially if you fear heights.Highly recommend the hike for amazing views and a great workout.","September 29, 2013",Camping on the Peak,9,,5

Guadalupe Peak,"I will start off by saying that the hype is real. This was a strenuous hike, especially in the middle of a hot summer day. I am 31 and my girlfriend is 24, we both are in decent shape, and at times this was a taxing hike. We took several breaks on the way up, but we were still able to make it in about 2 hours and 45 minutes. Before we did this hike I did research to make sure I felt able to do it, and I will tell you now you can! There were older people hiking up, children hiking up... If you bring enough water and pace yourself, you should be able to make it. I read about complaints regarding no shade on the hike, but we found plenty of shade along the way. The hike down took about 2 hours and was a nice break on the calves. It was the most challenging hike, but also the most rewarding. And the other people on here were right, the first hill is the hardest by far. And it is disheartening getting to the back of that first hill and seeing how far you still have to go. You can and will complete this hike! Enjoy the view! ","July 30, 2013",Strenuous hike that was well worth it.,6,,5
Guadalupe Peak,"First off, if you are planning this hike you know you are going to hike to 8,751 feet (the highest point of Texas!) & will ascend 3,000' in 4.1 miles. The being said if you are up for this challenge you will be rewarded with amazing views...some of the most beautiful in the world (& I have had the good fortune to see many things around the world). And I think Texas is 13th (?) in US state rankings for highest points in USA so is a cool accomplishment.We did a Friday & Saturday @ Carlsbad Caverns & a Sunday trip to Guadalupe Mountains just to hike the peak. Is less than one hour drive from Carlsbad Caverns so don't come all this way until you spend at least one full day at the Caverns! It was wife & I (in our 40's) & our 8 year old nephew.First off, if you plan to take a kid on this hike he better be a ""super"" kid like our nephew who enjoyed it immensely & is a natural athelete. But for the average kid under 10 years old and/or if the child is at all out of shape and/or a ""moody"" child then this is NOT for kids!We planned carefully...figured 6 hour trip time as website claimed so brought a bottle of water (1/2 liter) per person per hour & was quite warm on trail so almost all of it was used. Unless you are an experienced hiker who knows how much you consume then don't be foolish...be prepared as there is NO water once you get on the trail. We had hiking staves which also made the hike MUCH better as they offered support on the steep ascent & descent. We wore trail running shoes which are the bare minimum type for the tread & sturdy design needed. People do this in running shoes but not recommended as trail is slick & you need all the grip & support your feet can get. Also, not much shade on this hike so wear a hat as the sun is brutal.It took us 4 hours to go up & 3 to come down w/ frequent 1-2 minute breaks to sit. The little guy's legs & shorter strides meant the descent probably took twice as long as it should have but going up we were the slow ones. It is indeed very strenuous but physically do-able even for myself who is in just ""average"" shape. Take your time, don't forget to stop & enjoy the views, & drink plenty of water.It is ALL worth is for the world class views that you see every step of the day (& the views change as you make your way over the peaks). Bring your camera & take lots of pictures!Make sure you stop at visitors center, study map of route, etc as the first peak is a false summit...you think you accomplished a lot by getting to top & then you find you are barely 1/4 of way to top...so for mental piece of mind know the trail map so you can tell where you are. Start early to beat the heat...we hit the trail @ 8 AM & probably should have planned to leave at dawn. THE NEGATIVE: for me (not the wife) I am not afraid of heights but for sure was freaked out that some parts of the trail seem to be VERY narrrow & on one side is rock face (no problem there) & other side is sheer face where one slip = DOOM so if you have ANY fear of heights you will find this trek is NOT for you. Toward the top at the last few switchbacks when I looked around the bend I thought that's it, no way, that is not a trail that is a slanted narrow ledge of rock in side of a mountain...which it was but I pushed forward anyway! Also the steepness of the trail...you literally are climbing stairs/steep ramp switchbacks for the entire 4.1 miles up so if you not in shape for this don't bother. The first mile probably the steepest so if you can make it past there take your time & the rest is do-able.Is well worth the pain for the views.

Guadalupe Peak,"This is the “must do” hike in the park and for good reason. It is challenging. It summits at the highest point in Texas (8,749 feet). There are innumerable wonderful views and photo opportunities along the trail. Like all climbs, the view from the top is the final prize. Between the length of the hike (8 1/2 miles) and the elevation gain (3,000 ft.), this trail truly tested but did not torture us. We are in our late 60's, in reasonable condition, with the “normal” challenges that come with age. When we reached the top we were rewarded with a clear day and beautiful views. We enjoyed some lunch and with El Capitan in the background, took turns taking photos of other hikers in front of the monument Don't forget to sign the log book.

It took us 5 hours to make it to the top and 3 hours to get back to the parking lot. If you freeze your water, not only will it keep you cool, it's easier to drink than warm water.

We enjoyed both hikes. Smith Spring is a very nice, quiet, serene area that you wouldn't expect to find. After hiking through strictly desert scenery, the spring is all of a sudden right there. Very nice. The Devil's Hall hike was nice too but a quite rocky for a majority of it. We lunched at the ""hall"" and enjoyed this hike as well. This national park is basically a hiking, RV'ing park.

Guadalupe Peak,"I love this park with all its diversity-desert, canyons,and the highest peak in Texas. When it comes to hiking you can choose your level of difficulty-the paved trail to the old Butterfield Stagecoach Station to an all day hike. The Visitor Center off Hwy 62/180 is small and the exhibits have been there a while but there is a wealth of information presented and the rangers here are very knowledgeable. There is also a 13 minute orientation film. A second visitor center is at the end of McKittrick Canyon access road. I prefer the Fall as the scenery and fall colors in McKittrick Canyon can be stunning. Spring is also a good time to visit, but summers are hot. Whenever I am eastbound out of El Paso, I leave Interstate 10 and cut up to Guadalupe National Park before returning to Interstate 10 at Van Horn, TX.

Guadalupe Peak,"This is an interesting hike, nine miles round-trip with about 3,000 feet of elevation change. The trail is well maintained and the grade is moderate with (no surprise) lots of switchbacks. The hike starts at about about 5,800 feet and the summit is at 8,750 so for someone like me who dwells at sea-level the elevation was noticeable. It took me about 2 1/2 hours to ascend and 1 1/2 hours to descend. On the ascent I took a couple of short rest stops. Even in early April it was a warm hike. The wind was gusting pretty good in places, and the temperature at the higher elevations was lower, but it's still a hike that requires plenty of water. I was advised at the park visitor center to carry a gallon! I did take 4 liters, but this was definitely overkill. Having said this, I drank about 2 liters and it's always good to have some water in reserve. As you climb, the vegetation changes from desert plants to trees. It's still pretty dry at the higher elevations, but there is a clear change in vegetation with increasing elevation.The views, both along the way and from the summit, are great.I don't know if this is typical, but on a Monday in early April there were only 8 other hikers on the trail.Overall a very nice day hike.","April 8, 2013",Moderately Challenging Hike with a Great View,81,"Glendale, California",4
Guadalupe Peak,"I was intimated by the length of the trail combined with the elevation change but our family agreed that it was not the hardest hike because of the gradual slope. Unfortunately, I'm afraid of heights and for almost the entire hike you are on the trail which winds around the mountain exposed. While the slopes were not too steep I still not feel very comfortable. There is not where to really stop along the way until you reach the campground area. The trees that line the trail about half way up are a welcome break and provide shade in the heat of the day. I finally stopped at the campground area to just wait while the rest of my party went on to the peak. The trail just got to scary for me. They were able to reach the peak, take pictures and return to the campground in about an hour and 15 minutes. Total time to hike the peak was about 6 hours at a comfortable pace. So glad we brought poles and had good shoes for the elevation. Temperatures were nice in the 60's and it was a nice breeze. I can't imagine doing this hike in much hotter weather due to minimal shade. The views were stunning from up top but the hike along the way was average.

I rather thought that because of the even evaluation gain on the way up, it was moderate. Comparing this tour with the south rim trip I would definitely vote for the south rim as its so unique. However, the trip to the peak provides a more alpine kind of hike and is defenetly something special for Texas.

Guadalupe Peak,"Having visited about half the national parks and national monuments in the United States, Guadalupe Mountains National Park is not even in the top half. Yes indeed, this park has many places to hike and great views of the valleys below. But most national parks have vast hiking trails, such as Yosemite, Zion, Redwoods, and even Death Valley. Guadalupe Mountains National Park is far from lodging, gasoline, or any food that you can buy. And watch your speed. (No, I did not get pulled over when I visited this park last week.) But I did speak to both a Texas state trooper and a park ranger who patrol this area. The speed limit is 55 miles per hour as you travel on the main highway (US 180/US 62) through this national park. I learned that you could get stopped after going just 3 miles per hour over the posted speed limit. At the Frijole Ranch Museum, you will read about early ranchers in the area, including a small schoolhouse were eight children were taught. The staff at the nearby Pine Springs Visitor Center were polite, but seemed clueless. For example, a key was obtained to open the locked gate at Salt Basin Dunes, located about 50 miles from this visitor center. The key must be returned at the end of the day. The rangers were ignorant regarding the exact address for the National Park Service Contact Station in Dell City, Texas, which is the nearest place to drop off the lock key for the Salt Basin Dunes padlock. It was after dark when we arrived in Dell City. The ranger contact station is set back from the road in a group of buildings. The address turned out to be 280 S. Main St., Dell City, Texas. The key was placed in a broken lockbox at this location. With regard to the Salt Basin Dunes, my girlfriend and I arrived within the second parking area after unlocking the padlock on the gate. We looked at the ""Salt Basin Dunes,"" and began laughing. The dunes are located far from the parking area, and are very tiny. Awesome dunes of sand are located in Alamogordo, New Mexico at the White Sands National Monument. Seeing the ""dunes"" at Guadalupe Mountains National Park is like visiting Niagara Falls, and then seeing water flow out of a garden hose. Not very impressive.

The first part of this hike is tough, uphill switch backs, the middle 3rd in the forest is the easiest part with only moderate uphill and scrambling sections. Short legged people will have the toughest time. The last ¼ mile is a scramble up a rough rock path. Plan on all day for this hike. It was a cool day (60’s) with fog and mist for the first hour or so, my wife and I packed aprox 3 liters of water several cans of tomato juice and half a dozen energy bars. We could have used more water. Wear the best hiking boots you can get your hands on, tennis shoes won’t cut it. Walking stick is a good idea. The campground fills up on weekends (probably 100+ people) so you think there will be lots of people on the peak trail but out of that crowd maybe 12 went to the peak.

The views are great! Past this section the trails enters into a pine forest that gives you a little break from the switchbacks. After passing through the forest the trail turns to the other side of the ridge line and you can see El Capitan for the first time.

Guadalupe Peak,"This is a moderate walk for experienced hikers, about 3000 ft up and a 8.5 mile round trip. (I am 67 but have been doing things like this many years) I did the hike on May 1, 2012. The high that day was about 90 degF. Heat was not a problem in the dry climate. I started at 6AM, drinking 1 qt of water at the trailhead and carrying 2 qts of gatorade. The trail could be done with athletic shoes, but I recommend boots because of the rocky trail. Also, prepare for sun exposure. The trail will take you to the high right edge of the ridge that presents to you at the trailhead. It takes about 1 hr to get around the ridge. After that the trail has an easier slope and there are some trees. At the 2 hr mark, there is a sturdy wooden bridge over a drop-off. The peak is clearly visible. Another 30 minutes and you are on top (all these times based on steady walking and no rest periods). A fine view. If you are quiet, large swallows will swoop (40 mph?) by just 10 ft or so over the peak, creating the sound of a fast moving projectile. Amazing. After spending time at the top, I got down at 11:30 AM with one qt of gatorade un-opened.","May 11, 2012",Nice walk,30,North Carolina,4
Guadalupe Peak,"My son's 7th grade class and their families all went to the Guadalupe Mountains. Completely exhausted after a five mile hike up and a five mile hike back, I learned a few things on this journey: take a walking stick with you, take snacks and plenty of drinks, I am not a mountain hiker / climber!The four in my family went, including me, my husband, 12 year old son and seven year old daughter. Yes, we made it to the top, yes it was a nice day but FREEZING at the top. Yes, we thought we were dying, and yes, I am very proud of myself. It really was beautiful and I had a feeling of accomplishment at the top. I can say with certainty that I will not EVER do it again, but for a real outdoorsman type, this would be the place to be. This helped me to decide that the closest I want to be to nature is hanging out, lounging in a pool!At the top, the last 20 or so feet, I felt like it was a bit dangerous, but it went off without a hitch. Most of the mountain is a trail, with just that bit of ruggedness toward the top.","April 19, 2012","Fabulous, but I'll never do it again!",8,"San Angelo, Texas",5
Guadalupe Peak,"On December 17th at around 8:00 am three of my friends and I started the Guadalupe Peak trail with daypacks packed with lunch, snacks, rope, around fifteen liters of water for the four of us, compasses, a first-aid kit, and other small hiking necessities. The first mile and a half or so was fairly tough with plenty of switchbacks. The mountain scenary is breathtaking-we had to continually remind ourselves that we were in Texas! The last mile of the ascent was in or above the clouds and is quite a teaser; full of false summits. We started seeing snow patches about two miles into the hike. The altitude was not too much of a problem because we had camped at Pine Springs campground the night before (elevation 5700 feet). We reached the summit (elevation 8749 feet) a little before 11:00 am, followed by three other groups. The summit is more extreme than the altitude suggests because Guadalupe Peak is at the end of the Guadalupe Mountains chain-we could see the eastern salt flats (elevation 3400) only about 11 miles away. We could see the top of El Capitan directly to the south. It was about 30 degrees fahrenheit at the top. We ate a feast at the top of the peak and rested for about an hour and a half. We made it back down in a little over two hours. Overall the hike was not strenuous, it was barely windy, and it was completely manageable during the winter. Be sure to bring strong hiking boots-it's rocky nearly the whole way. I imagine during the summer it can get quite hot because there is barely any tree cover. There are also no water stops along the way-I recommend bringing at least three to five liters per person. The trail is well-marked and there's a backcountry campground about a mile before the summit. For four high school seniors who live at 600 feet elevation, this hike was incredible and the perfect way to start Christmas vacation.","December 25, 2011",Well worth the drive and effort.,6,"Dallas, Texas",5
Guadalupe Peak,"The hike is ok but what I found special on this trip arethe views from the top. You can see tens of miles away.With a light backpack and basketball shoes it took meand my friend 2h 20 min from the trail head at the endof the parking lot to the peak and 1h 50min to getback. We did not take any big breaks, just short onesfor pictures. We are grad students (~30 years old) and try to work out a few times a week in our spare time. So it is possible to do much better than the 6-8h average everyone tells you. One the peak we met a couple that said it took them roughly 4h to get there. Also consider we did the hike in July at 90F (32C).My GPS did not work that well over there. It showed6.6 miles on the way up and 5.2 on the way back.The trail is considered to have 4.2 each way so 8.4in total. A ranger told me it is known GPS does notwork very well in the area.We have not seen any rattlesnakes, possibly becauseof the hot weather. The ranger said during coolerweather many people see them.If you are scared of them (we certainly were) consider what two rangers told us:Since 1972 when the Park was established no onewas bitten by a rattlesnake. The trail is reasonablywide and rocky so it is easy to see a rattlesnakeif there is one.I wish I did not take my basketball shoes. As I said,the trail is pretty rocky and you feel it especiallyon the descent. Take hiking shoes if possible.","July 6, 2011",Amazing view from the top,145,"Sydney, Australia",4
Guadalupe Peak,"For the last year I have been thinking about climbing Guadalupe Peak. In October, I made the commitment but I had to postpone the trip twice because of high winds at the summit which were gusting up to 85 mph. Then with a window of good weather, I drove the 650 miles to Van Horn and then 60 miles to the Guadalupe Mountains National Park the next morning. The 8.4 mile trek is rated “difficult” by the Parks Service. The younger guys who were with me kept stopping to rest and after five hours into the climb, and only reaching the halfway point, they all dropped out. I went on alone completing the second half in 2-½ hours. Upon reaching the summit it was late afternoon with no time to rest. After taking some photos to document the achievement, calling his wife on my cell phone, and writing my name in the summit registry, I headed back down the mountain. At this point, I figured I could make the journey down from the peak in three hours which would be an hour after sundown. Hurrying down the rocky path I got past all the narrow cliff ledges with 1,000 foot drops while there was still daylight and then in the fading light I made it back to the trailhead taking exactly three hours. I plan to do it again in the spring or next fall, but at age 66, I'm going to put a lot more effort into training this time. Guadalupe Peak was an important landmark used by the Butterfield Stage and Pony Express Riders to help guide them across the desert. Later when airplanes started carrying mail, the early pilots used this landmark as a way point.The stainless steel pyramid was erected on the summit in 1958 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Butterfield Overland Mail.One side of the pyramid displays a U.S. Postal Service tribute to the Pony Express Riders of the Butterfield Stage. The second side displays a compass with a pilot inside and of the Boy Scouts of America logo. The third side has the American Airlines logo as they were the first airline to deliver airmail for the postal service.A summit registry contained in a metal box is located at the base of the pyramid.Here are the photos of my trip...http://s236.photobucket.com/albums/ff117/AvianQuest/Guadalupe%20Mountains%202010/","December 1, 2010",What an Experience!,127,"Conroe, Texas",5
Guadalupe Peak,"We had stopped at this park on our way to Las Cruces, NM from Austin, TX and what a wonderful stop it was. This park has gorgeous mountain views, lush greenery, a natural spring, natural pond, and greate hiking trails (long and short). This is a definite must see if you are in the area. There are rattlesnakes, so be cautious while hiking on the trails. We did not see any rattlers the day we went but they are out there. You will also find a host of other natural wildlife in this American park treasure. The whole family will have a great time here!","September 27, 2009",Gorgeous Park - A Must See When Traveling in West Texas,64,"Las Cruces, New Mexico",5

Guadalupe Peak,"Guadalupe Peak is a spectacular hike with impressive summit views from the highest peak in Texas. A rise of over 5,000 ft. from the salt flats to the west, views 100 miles in all directions can be seen from the summit on clear days reaching all the way to 12,000 ft. Sierra Blanca in Southern New Mexico. A well maintained but rocky trail will take you up 3,000 ft. from the park headquarters in about 2 and 1/2 to 3 hours. This hike will take you from the desert below to forested lands above and will give you impressive views of the big walls of El Capitan to the south and Shumard Peak to the north. Impressive views into the interior of Guadalupe Mountains National Park towards Bush Mountain and Hunter Peak can also be seen. This peak is well worth the time and effort to climb.","December 6, 2004",A big Texas Suprise,41,"Dallas, TX",4
