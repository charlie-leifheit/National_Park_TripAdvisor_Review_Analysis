Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,Wonderful day on our cruise sailing around the bay. Park Rangers were on board to talk about the extraordinary sights (and sites).

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We cruised through Glacier Bay on our Holland America Ship, The Westerdam. The sites in this bay are just not describable. I have pictures that if I were not there, I would think they cant be real. We had a wonderful sunny day! The calving glaciers are again... indescribable! I feel so blessed to have had the experience!","September 30, 2019",Rated a 5 but would like to rate higher!!!,18,"Wauwatosa, Wisconsin",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We visited this pristine national park as part of our cruise and words could never do justice to such a jewel. It really is a ""wonder of the world"". The water was like a sheet of glass and it was so peaceful and serene as we cruised along. We spotted a few whales and seals in our travels but the highlight would have to be the Marjorie Glacier amongst several others we saw along the way.At one stage our ship was boarded by several local national park rangers who gave a great insight to the park in general.Our cruise that day through this natural wonder is a day I will never forget. It really is that special.","September 30, 2019",A World Wonder,140,"South Yunderup, Australia",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Cruising Glacier Bay was by far the highlight of our cruise. Clear skies and amazing views from all over the ship. If you don’t do any excursions and just stay on boat the entire time Glacier Bay makes it all worthwhile.I was concerned not having a balcony room would be an issue during this part of the trip and that we would be stuck in crowds and not able to get a good view. However, lots of folks were on the upper deck and the views are so vast it’s easy to get great photos and a find a good seat / view to watch from.","September 29, 2019",Unreal!!,35,"Kenmore, Washington",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We spent a day in Glacier Bay aboard Holland America MS Eurodam. It was truly an unforgettable experience. The glaciers are magnificent and also a startling and eye opening reminder of the effects global warming is having on our planet. This area is truly untouched and awe inspiring. I recommend everyone visit at least once. Being on such a large ship does make it difficult to imagine the scale of the glaciers, but the views are spectacular. In addition to the glaciers we saw sea otters, seals, bald eagles, sea lions and killer whales.","September 28, 2019",Unforgettable Experience ,14,,5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We spent the day cruising Glacier Bay while on our trip. The rangers board the ship while we are in transit and leave the same way. They first do a presentation to let us know what to expect, what we will see and information about the different inlets and glaciers. A map is provided so you can follow along as we transit. You see some of the wildlife along the way. We didn't see whales on this trip but we did see them early on at the beginning of the trip. The rangers narrates throughout the day pointing out wildlife, information and history of the area. The rangers show a real passion for preserving this beautiful area. I don't know if I have ever seen such a beautiful place and I believe it has to be one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"I came to Glacier Bay on a Nat Geo/Lindblad trip and we spent the entire day cruising up and back, visiting glaciers, viewing mountain goats, seeing whales, and more. The day was beautiful, not a cloud in the sky and mild temperatures. It's worth a visit, even a short one, and if the weather is clear you can see the stunning Fairweather range as well. The glaciers, however, are suffering and retreating at an alarming rate so don't wait too long to visit.","September 25, 2019",Stunning Does Not Do It Justice,51,"Quakertown, Pennsylvania",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We stayed at Glacier Bay Lodge in Mid August 2019. We are a family of 6 and our only regret was that we didn't stay longer. The boat trip is narrated by a park ranger. The glaciers are absolutely beautiful and watching them calve is fascinating. I have never seen such beautiful natural beauty. in addition to the glaciers we saw mama bears and cubs playing in the water and catching salmon. We saw whales, puffins, eagles, other birds, sea otters, seals. It was truly spectacular. Highly recommend !","September 22, 2019",Wonderful stay at Glacier Bay Lodge and fantastic all day boat tour from lodge,0,,5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,Our Holland America cruise ship went way into Glacier Bay to see the all of the different glaciers. We were given maps as well as live commentary and were able to stand outside on parts of the ship that were normally off limits to passengers. You could not only see the glaciers calving ( ice chunks coming off into the Bay ) but hear them as well. To see such sights was inspiring but to realize how far away you were was difficult due to the lack of any objects to judge the height of the glacier on.,"September 18, 2019",fantasic place to visit,0,,5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"I took the Holland America Cruise 7 nights Glacier Discovery Cruise Southbound from Seward to Vancouver, just for the priviledge of viewing this magnificent Glacier Bay National Park And Reserve for myself.There is over 3.2 million acres of massive glacials, inlet and shore, forest and majestic mountain peaks.Only 2 cruise ships are allowed to enter daily, so as to protect this pristine Park.There was a controlled collision, to enable the park rangers to board the cruise ship, and share about this great Glacial Bay National Park with us.It was a treat to be able to sail to Johns Hopkins Glacier which had been closed throughout the summer month, to allow the protected seals to calve.Then we proceeded to the famous tidewater Margerie Glacial, which is about a mile wide.The Captain will turn the ship around, so that both port and starboard sides can enjoy the incredible views of these glaciers.The bow was opened especially for our incredible viewing, on a beautiful sunny day.Try to stay outside and wait patiently, as I was rewarded with viewing and hearing the crack of the calving of these 2 main glaciers after the ship was turned.It is rare that Glacier Bay hosts a few advancing glaciers (due to heavy snowfall in the mountains), despite threats from global warming whereby many glaciers are unfortunately retreating instead.Helen LimSingapore","September 16, 2019",Great Glacier Bay National Park And Reserve,94,"Singapore, Singapore",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We selected a cruise trip to Alaska because of the opportunity to view the glaciers and this day in the National Park fulfilled the lifelong goal. A high point was having knowledgeable park staff on board for the 5+ hours within park boundaries, with audio and video broadcast throughout the ship - Princess Cruise Line did get this right. It was a calm and sunny day, so we had a ""front seat"" to the stark and dramatic shoreline, including 4-5 glaciers and one modest calving. There was no large wildlife that day, but not the fault of the NPS. We did have the opportunity to ask direct questions about global warming and climate change - nobody we spoke with was denying the impacts in this unique U.S. national park.","September 15, 2019",Privileged to see glaciers (and climate change) up close,136,"Wheat Ridge, Colorado",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"I took the day boat trip from Glacier Bay Lodge in mid August 2019. It is a bit of a hassle to get to Gustavus from anywhere however it was so worth it.We had a beautiful day and saw lots of wildlife including harbour seals, stellar sea lions, puffin, seabirds, 3 x bears, humpback whales as well as 3 glaciers. A National Park Ranger joins the tour and Ranger Erica was absolutely wonderful. Her enthusiasm for the Park and nature generally was infectious and she was so approachable. She encouraged us to do the Juniour Ranger program while on board. Lunch and snacks were included on the boat and were satisfactory. I heard that the boat does not wait for anyone, so I would recommend taking the afternoon Alaska Airlines flight from Juneau to Gustavus, staying overnight in Gustavus and then departing that evening after the trip on Alaska Airlines to ensure that you do not miss the boat. Definitely make the effort to include Glacier Bay National Park in your itinerary.","September 15, 2019",Worth it!!,12,"Sydney, Australia",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Glacier Bay was breathtaking. We had our own personal National Park guides assist the cruise line through the waters to Glacier Margerie. She roar'd through the mountain valleys. I didn't know Glaciers made noises! FUN FACT: Glacier Margerie moves about 6 feet per day. We got to witness three separate glacial breaks. The dirty outsides of the glacier ice exposed a brilliantly, icy blue beneath (to match the surrounding waters). This is only 1 of over 1000's of glaciers in Glacier Bay. On the Gulf of Alaska side of Glacier Bay, we also stopped to see Glacier Hubbard. It was even louder than Glacier Margerie. We didn't see any breaks, but we didn't need to. The ocean surrounding Glacier Hubbard was filled with chunks of glacial ice that had broken off before. Glacier Hubbard is 6 miles wide, we only got to see 3 miles of it from the cruise ship. These glaciers are a spectacular site and (from what I could tell) no two are the same.","September 13, 2019",There's Thunder but No Storm,15,"Burnsville, Minnesota",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"This was definitely the highlight of our cruise! I really appreciated the fact that we spent the whole day in the park. We had park rangers come on board the ship, and they narrated what we were seeing and gave a presentation about the history of the glaciers. It was amazing to witness this natural phenomenon in person. No photo can prepare you for what it is like to see the glaciers in person. The whole ship felt the same way, as they day was spent quietly observing everything we were seeing.","September 11, 2019",Breathtaking View,7,,5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We were on a Holland America cruise and to be honest, I did wonder why we would spend a day in Glacier Bay. Now I know and it was an absolute highlight!!!We were lucky to see another big cruise ship leaving the Margerie Glacier as we arrived, this gave us a sense of the size of the Glacier. We spent an hour stopped off shore from the Glacier could hear it thundering and cracking although we didn’t see if calve. Small “icebergs” floating by - some loaded with birds. Saw other glaciers, waterfalls and great scenery- it was a fantastic day. Good to have knowledgeable park staff on board for the day - there is lots to learn about Glacier Bay.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Cruised in around 9am and the Park Rangers boarded the cruise ship. It was a little foggy early on, but the sun came out and it was amazing to cruise all the fingers in the bay and see multiple Glaciers. About 6 hours was spent on this tour!Rangers have noted that the Glaciers are receding at a rapid rate, and several passengers that have been here before said it has changed drastically in the past 5 years. If you want to see this great area I would suggest you not wait a long time. The next generation may not have this area as a natural wonder.","September 9, 2019",Highlight of our Holland America Cruise - Beautiful,69,"Seattle, Washington",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,We cruised through Glacier Bay while on a cruise. We spent a few hours taking in All of the Glaciers. They are beyond breathtaking. To say large would be an understatement. Loved hearing the history on each. Seals/otters were swimming or floating on by. The ice & wind picks up as you approach each. What an amazing sight to experience. ,"September 7, 2019",Awesome Sights ,96,"New Orleans, Louisiana",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"They are supposed to be here. Snow falls in the mountains, builds up, causes downward pressure, and slides down the mountain taking a path of least resistance. During this entire process, the moving ice acts like sandpaper and carves the mountains. Yes, there is a lot of the same.......Lower your expectations before you go as the weather will probably be overcast, cold, raining, snowing or foggy.","September 6, 2019",Get over it.... these are glaciers...

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Went to Glacier Bay as part of my Holland America Cruise and I was incredibly grateful for the entire day spent in this completely wild and untouched park and preserve.

To see such pristine beauty is an opportunity that I hope everyone gets at some point in their lives.","August 29, 2019",Highlight of Our Cruise,194,"Mineral, Virginia",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We went to Glacier Bay National Park as part of our Princess Cruise to Alaska. I can't say enough good about it. The views, as expected were phenomenal! You will see animals, but what you see and when you see them will depend on the animals. If you have a good camera you will get excellent pictures. If you have a balcony room, you could stay in it, but my opinion is that you will get more out of this trip if you move around and see everything from multiple angles, including your balcony if you have one. If you don't have a balcony, don't worry, the only thing you will miss is the comfort of your bed. I think my favorite part was having the rangers aboard the ship. First of all it is obvious that they love their jobs. Secondly, they really want to share their love of this park and all their knowledge about it with visitors. You will learn so much about glaciers, how they were formed, how they have shaped the land, what is happening to them now and what the future holds. Pay attention, it's your future too.","August 28, 2019",Beautiful and a must see,38,Syracuse NY,5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"A stunning bay with equally stunning Glacier. The views are wonderful when one considers the daily actions of the Glacier.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We saw Glacier Bay National Park as part of an Island Princess Cruise tour. Two park rangers boarded the cruise ship during our time in Glacier Bay on Aug. 5 supposedly to narrate our time there, but they didn't do much. One spoke for about 5 minutes over the PA system as we entered the park about what we might see but after that, never got on the PA again to talk about the wildlife or teach about the glaciers (different types, melting, etc.). (We learned way more from the Glacier Bay flier delivered to our stateroom/cabin.) One gave a glacier talk in the auditorium as the ship left the area and we attended hoping to learn more, however, she only talked about what inspired her to become a ranger and the importance of conservation. More than half the audience was put to sleep! We enjoyed visiting Glacier Bay but were extremely disappointed with the useless park rangers.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Seeing it all in one day is only made possible by the dedicated rangers and the boat tour that leaves from the dock at Glacier bay National Park. While biking through the park, a very nice ranger stopped with us as we were looking at some of the plant life. She answered many questions about both the native and invasive plants. Adding to the great experience was a boat tour that we took that left from the park dock. On the full day tour we saw bears, puffin, sea lions, otters, mountain goats, seals, and whales. Oh, and the many glaciers on the way to Johns Hopkins Glacier where we also got to see some calving. A very spectacular day. ","August 23, 2019",Seeing it all in one day,16,,5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Our Holland America criuse took us to Glacier Bay National Park. In doing our research before we found that Holland America is one of 2 liners that always get to go into Glacier Bay. There are only 2 ships allowed per day to go in. We wanted to make sure we were one of them so we picked Holland America. They have a some park rangers and local Alaskan Tribe members come onto the ship to give you true and honest information about the park, very informative. We liked that we were still on the ship and had access to everything, food, beverages and our balcony to hang out on. The size of the glaciers will blow your mind. There is what looks to be a small boat that was much closer than our ship got. But when we saw if away from the glacier you see it's not small at all.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We spent to day sailing gently through some of the most beautiful scenery we have seen. As we came past Gustavus, the sea fog started to lift and the shores of Glacier Bay were revealed. Our cruise ship had a park ranger on board who talked about the geology and history of the inlet, the animal and sea creatures that we might see, glaciers, and global warming. As we got further in the inlet, we started to see floating ice, small bits at first, but getting larger as we went further. The ship entered Tarr Inlet, and approached Marjorie Glacier, where we spend an hour watching the glacier and listening to it groan and crack. There were a couple of minor calvings, but no major ice falls. It was fascinating to see how blue the compressed ice can be. The ship then went into Johns Hopkins Inlet and we saw the two glaciers that feed into it. It was obvious from the present positions of the glaciers that they are melting at an accelerated rate and they have shrunk back substantially over recent years. The size and power of glaciers is awesome, and their effects in shaping the surface of the earth is incredible.","August 18, 2019",Awesome ...,243,"Abbotsford, Canada",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We cruised thru Glacier Bay on Princess Cruise lines. Fortunately we reserved space in the ‘Sanctuary’ which afforded us reserved seats and freedom to go outside on deck and then back for shelter and seats. The scenery is beautiful but you just can’t get close enough on a big ship. We had three amazing, up close & personal glacier experiences before cruising which probably spoiled us. We knew what we were missing while on the big ship. If you are able to visit on your own, do it.

We were lucky enough to witness several calvings off the glacier & hearing the thundering sounds of others in the distance is just awesome!Whether you are a believer in global warming or not, glaciers naturally change & this one is no different...eventually it won't be here to marvel at....so if you have the opportunity to visit it, DO IT!!!!!!","August 15, 2019",SEE IT BEFORE IT'S GONE!,113,"Toowoomba, Australia",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Glacier Bay is right out phenomenal, from scenery to wildlife. It’s accessible mostly by ship, and there are many choices of cruises depending on how active you want to be and how much you want to spend. It’s at least a full day trip.The scenic goal on our cruise was the tidewater Marjorie Glacier. It is truly magnificent, from seashore to way back up into the ice field. Unfortunately, while we were there, there was no calving.More emotionally stunning was the Lamplugh Glacier in Johns Hopkins Sound. It really showed the flow of a glacier from the mountains to the sea. However, most concerning was that it had retreated significantly in only one year due to global warming. A tragic warning to us all!During the long cruise that day, the mountain to sea scenery was amazing. We did see distant whales but not much else of wildlife.Park Service rangers boarded the ship and provided narration. Unfortunately, due to Holland America’s primitive on-board technology, we did not hear as much of this as we wanted.You definitely want to go there sooner than later. If you can afford it, do a small ship cruise or a unicruise that offers land touring, not a large ship cruise. However, we will always treasure our trip to Glacier Bay.","August 15, 2019",Absolutely Must See,46,"Woolwich, Maine",5

Then we got to the Marjorie glacier. We stayed in this area for a couple of hours and the ship just slowly rotated around.

We kept ourselves busy by hiking most the trails around the lodge. We attended the Park Service movies, enjoyed the visitor center displays, attended the ranger walks & Tlingit activities. Dan did wonderful presentations on the Tlingit people & their culture. Our 8 hour boat trip to see a few of the glaciers of Glacier Bay was everything we had hoped for. We saw sea lions, seals, sea otters, mountain goats, salmon, and eagles on our way to and from the glaciers. Ranger Matt did an excellent job of pointing things out and explaining things. We were VERY fortunate to come across a small pod of orcas. Because we weren't on a cruise ship, our captain was able throttle back our comparatively small boat and float near the orcas for a period of time. We hung out at Margerie & Grand Pacific glaciers for over 30 minutes. We could hear the moaning, groaning from Margerie glacier and even saw a piece of this glacier break off and fall into the bay. Awesome. We had to stop a couple of miles short of the John Hopkins glacier because of nursing seal colony. We sailed past other glaciers as we made our way back to Bartlett cove. Wish I had taken advantage of the kayaking adventures that were available. While ""we"" didn't see any moose or bear, others staying at the lodge did. Our big animal encounter was with porcupines who lived in the trees around the lodge. The food at the Lodge for breakfast and dinner was very good. The menu options were adequate We weren't around the lodge for lunch. I do recommend eating from the deck menu, on the deck naturally, as a way to save some cash.","August 3, 2019",Glad we spent 5 nights & 4 days at the park,14,"Statesboro, Georgia",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Chose our cruise itinerary based primarily on the visit here and boy am I glad we did. It's breathtaking! Only a couple cruise ships can enter a day, so we were the only ship in the area when we were there. Gorgeous views in every direction - caving glaciers. Just amazing. My favorite part of our visit to Alaska.","August 2, 2019",Stunning!,61,"Denver, Colorado",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Like many others, I enjoyed Glacier Bay from a cruise ship (the Royal Princess).My visit was on a beautifully bright day, and no clouds or haze were interfering with the experience.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Visited on the Ruby Princess and the scenery and wildlife were just absolutely stunning. We managed to get very close to the Marjorie Glacier and stayed for around 45 - 60 minutes and it was breathtaking. Throughout our passage in and out of Glacier Bay we had National Park Rangers giving commentary throughout the ship and special presentations onboard, while we were able to view the wildlife including seals, birds and river otters right next to the ship. Glacier Bay is quite possibly the most naturally beautiful places we have ever visited.","July 30, 2019",Simply stunning,65,"Windermere, Florida",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We sailed into Glacier Bay on the Holland America Volendam - you can only see this park by boat or ship. They actually brought the park rangers on to the ship for presentations and narration while we sailed. We saw several tidewater glaciers - Margerie Glacier was the most impressive. We got to see a little bit of calving (ice falling into the ocean). The melted shapes in the ice were fascinating. In the bay and surrounding area up to the bay, we saw humpback whales, seals, brown (grizzly bears), mountain goals, and sea lions. The Volendam captain took it slow and gave us plenty of time to view the animals and the ice. The staff served hot drinks and Dutch pea soup while we were on the bow view - great way to keep warm. They also turned the boat completely around so people trying to watch from their balconies/lanai chairs could see it without going up to the bow. Great day - Alaska is magnificent. (We also saw orcas [killer whales] on our way back to Vancouver, in the Inside Passage along British Columbia.)","July 25, 2019",Best day of our Alaska cruise - stunning scenery and wildlife,57,Colorado,5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"I came to the park to visit my daughter while she was employed there this summer. I cannot recommend this park enough. I worried that I would not find enough to do. I enjoyed the naturalist programs, the Tlingit cultural history, a trip on the day boat up bay to see the glaciers...and also orcas and humpbacks! I dined at the Lodge dining room. The halibut fish and chips on the deck was a dining delight. I splurged on the skillet cookie for dessert. There are trails to hike but I did not have time to do those as we did the Taz whale-watching trip and the Glacier Bay Sea Kayak trip instead. If you need a trip to town or to the local ATM, catch one of the lodge shuttles (they run to the airport and ferry dock) and they'll get you where you need to go.","July 24, 2019",Wonderful experience,6,"Angola, Indiana",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Seeing Glacier Bay does not begin to describe the serenity and beauty provided by the surroundings. The mountains around the bay are magnificent as are streams that cascade down from the glaciers. While we were cruising the park, the waters were calm and clear and provided the opportunity to see several types of fish. Naturally we also saw several whales in the bay. While in the bay we also saw ice calving when several chunks of ice broke from the glacier. Just a magnificent thing to watch. Going to Glacier Bay on a cruise ship is definitely a peaceful way to spend a day on a balcony. Doesn’t get much better.","July 10, 2019",Peaceful and Beautiful,74,"Yuba City, California",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We toured Glacier Bay via boat - the boat trip organized through the lodge is not the most inexpensive tour of the park, but it was a good time and a quick-efficient way to see Glacier Bay. We had a beautiful warm day...that being said, it was still cold on deck. Bring a hat and gloves! The seating on the boat is first come first served...so get to the dock a little before 7 so you are one of the first people on the boat. There are many window seats...but some seats are in the center and not as good. The boat has coffee, drinks, lunch (sandwiches, chips, chowder), and a cookie. Other food/drinks are available for purchase. Having the ranger on board was great - she would point out landmarks, talk about history, look for animals... The kids on board did a junior ranger program with her. Everyone was smiles. There was plenty of room to walk around inside and outside. The boat has bathrooms. The boat did not necessarily stop for wildlife - except for in a few pre-selected spots. Also, we did not go past Jaw Point towards the Johns Hopkins Glacier in June. The Margerie Glacier was the star of the show...and the one that created it all (Grand Pacific Glacier) sat black and uneventful. Also spend a day in Bartlett Cove doing the hikes and attending ranger talks - very nice (see separate review). Enjoy this beautiful park!","July 6, 2019",Beautiful!,249,"Warrenville, IL",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,Our second time in Glacier Bay and just as magnificent as the first. This absolute must see will not disappoint. Amazingly enough a big brown bear was swimming in the middle of the bay as if to welcome our ship into his home. A thrill I never thought I'd see and the naturalist was quite surprised as well.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"As part if our Alaskan cruise on the Coral Princess we got to experience Glacier Bay National Park. The ship was able to get very close to some of the Glaciers—so much so that we wee able to hear the thunderous crashing of ice as it fell into the water.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We chose this trip to see glaciers before they are gone, and Glacier Bay is a great place to do this! It is best viewed by ship (not sure if there is any other way). The day we went was absolutely gorgeous weather and we saw each glacier in all the glory imaginable. We spent all day in the bay, and saw/heard calving of ice. We saw seals on ice blocks, and some saw orca whales. The park rangers ride out to the cruise ship on their boat, board the ship, and spend all day with the passengers. They provided several presentations about the park, and brought souvenirs to sell to help preserve the park.","July 2, 2019",Everyone should experience this place,69,"Springfield, Ohio",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We went to Glacier Bay on a cruise (Island Princess) and it was beautiful. If you're considering going to Alaska to see the glaciers, I highly recommend going ASAP. A park ranger said that there used to be 9 tidal glaciers, now there's only 4 and they're predicting only 1 left in the next 10 years.The first stretch of the park, we saw lots of wildlife including bald eagles, humpback whales, harbor seals, coastal bears, otters, and mountain goat. Fair warning, most of these are rather far away from the ship so bring binoculars if you have 'em! The naturalist on our ship did a great job of pointing out where animals were.Then, we saw Marjorie Glacier! 30ish minutes on each side of the ship. This was the closest we got to a glacier while on the ship. If you want to take pictures with a glacier, now's the time. After taking lots of pictures, we spent the rest of our time watching for calving. There were some small pieces and, right around when we were leaving Marjorie, a large one fell! Incredible to see (and hear). Keep an eye out for areas where a lot of small pieces are falling. That's where the big piece is most likely to calve.We cruised over to Lamplugh and Johns Hopkins glacier after that. Super pretty cruise but you don't get as close to these glaciers, so Marjorie was definitely the highlight for me.","July 1, 2019",See glaciers up close and personal,30,"San Francisco, California",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We visited Glacier Bay by cruise ship. Only two cruise ships are allowed in the bay each day to aid the impact on the environment. If you ever get the chance to go, take it with both arms you wont be disappointed. The cruise ship stays in the bay for about 4 hours and is joined by a team of rangers who give a running commentary.

Gustavus is a tiny town with the best cafe (Fireweed) that I've been to!

You get a Ranger lectured cruise with a Captain on the boat who is in the loop, and a star lookout for natural talent (ie. Wildlife). The food is good but can be sparse, so bring some snacks unless you’re willing to pay. All in all, if you’re adventurous, rent a kayak and have this boat ferry you out and drop you off for a few days of TRUE adventure travel (and pick you up of course!).

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Glacier Bay National Park is mostly accessed by cruise ship, and you will spend up to eight hours (depending on your cruise) sailing in and around the bay visiting several glaciers. As the ship enters the bay, a ranger boards the ship to inform the passengers on the history of Glacier Bay, and what is happening at the moment. The main attraction is Margerie, a tidal glacier, which means that they usually stand really tall and tend to calve, sending big chunks of ice into the water and creating waves of glacial ice. Unfortunately on our cruise the glacier did calve, but it was so small you could hardly notice it. The whole experience of sailing in Glacier Bay was just magical. Being surrounded by all the snow-capped mountains and seeing several different types of glaciers on a beautiful clear, sunny day was just an awe inspiring moment.

These feats of nature are what created the world we live in today and have such a huge impact on our earth. I don't even have words to describe it. You are seeing mountains that are millions of years old! The park rangers got on our cruise ship and spent the day cruising the park with us and telling us all about what we were seeing!

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Not sure a review can ever really sum up this place. We visited via cruise ship, and the VERY slow ride up to the Marjorie Glacier allowed us to really take in the beauty of all the scenery. We saw sea otters, seals, mountain goats, eagles and more. It's just beautiful and breathtaking. The glacier itself (we spend an hour in front of it) was amazing and we were lucky to see it calving twice in that time. Wow!A visit to the glacier's (via cruise ship, at least) is a placid experience. If you're looking for action and adventure, it would not be for you. If you want to see amazing natural beauty, and are willing to just let it soak in and stir you, this place is great. On our cruise, we did other more active activities. But on our day in Glacier Bay, it was all about enjoying a place of immense beauty that we may never see again.The railings on the ship were crowded with onlookers, and there was plenty of talking, and plenty of children getting bored, etc...but my wife and I were not distracted from our appreciation.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,Visited in July 2018 with my husband and sons aged 16 and 17. It rained off and on during our week in Alaska but that is to be expected! We toughed it out for this amazing adventure. Stayed 2 nights at the Glacier Bay Lodge on site. We flew in from Juneau with Alaska Seaplanes to Gustavus. Took a Ranger led walk through forested area and around paths near the Main Lodge. Moss covered trees were incredible. A female Moose was spotted that evening (not by us) with her calf in a pond near where our tour passed. We saw numerous birds near where the boat tour departed from. The Main Lodge was the hub with the only cell phone service. You could sit by the fire and order a drink from the only restaurant on the grounds. There was also a small gift shop that was very nice. We ate at the restaurant and the food was very good. We also took the Boat tour of Glacier Bay ( I also have a Review of that). Glacier Bay Lodge rooms are spread around the main lodge into smaller structures connected by wooden walkways (can get slippery). They were no frills type and basic. NO TV or Internet but exactly what was needed for a National Park. You are here to experience Nature and that you will. Rain or shine!!,"November 6, 2018",Amazing even in the Rain!!!!,29,,5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Traveled to Glacier Bay in May on the Eurodam (Holland American Cruise Line). Outstanding views from the front of the ship, and from our veranda. Got very close to glaciers, saw some amazing calving of the glaciers. Also saw mountain goats, and sea otters. The commentary for the Park Ranger who had come aboard the ship was very helpful in understanding what we were seeing. Highly recommended!","November 4, 2018",Spectacular scenery and wildlife,31,"Menomonie, Wisconsin",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"I went out to Alaska with two friends and we spent a couple days in Gustavus. The highlight of our time there was of course the Glacier Bay Boat Tour. It's a full day activity, leaving from Bartlett Cove in the morning and getting back around 3pm. It's absolutely worth it!A couple tips:- Have waterPROOF (not just water resistant) pants and jackets. My friend found out the hard way that her pants were water resistant. After standing out on the deck to view one of the glaciers in a bit of a glacial monsoon, in addition to being in awe of the glacier we were seeing, her legs were actually getting wet through her two layers of pants. Much less fun.- Bring layers -- most of the time, you can chill inside the boat, which is a comfortable temperature and they have hot chocolate and coffee, and served a delicious soup... all nice ways to stay warm without wearing a billion layers. Then, when you head out to the deck to get a better look at things, you'll DEFINITELY want layers and hats and gloves.The only thing that would have made this trip even better is if we had chosen to kayak for a couple days. About halfway through our boat ride, we picked up some backpacking kayakers and I was extremely jealous. So, note to self, next time I'm in Alaska, I'll be booking an overnight kayak adventure for sure. An even CLOSER look at Glacier Bay National Park! :)We also did do some exploring on land. We took advantage of the short free ranger tour that leaves from Glacier Bay Lodge. It's cool to see the temperate rain forest right there and learn more about the vegetation and history of the area.We stayed in Gustavus town, but had access to bicycles, so were able to bike into the park. It was pretty neat to ride along the long main entry road and really take in the forest before you get to the Lodge and the water. We did see a bear while on our bikes, so be prepared for that!","October 22, 2018",Glacier Bay Boat Tour was amazing!,56,"Chicago, Illinois",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Instead of doing a round-trip cruise we elected to do a 1-way southbound so we could see Glacier National Park. I'm so glad we did. It was spectacular.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Like many people who get to see this park and his glaciers, we saw this during our Alaska cruise. Our cruise ship arrived in the Glacier Bay after being boarded by Rangers. They limit how many cruise ships can enter the bay to preserve the wild area. We passed glaciers that came up to the water, and could hear the sound of the glacier creaking and see the ice falling into the water, especially at the wonderful Margerie Glacier. The mountains were covered with snow and on our day the sky was bright blue. You can see also many seals and many nice otters :)We would definitely like to visit this place again and again and again!","October 18, 2018",the beauty of nature,144,"Rome, Italy",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,We observed this amazing National Park & Preserve while aboard the Norwegian Pearl Cruise Line. Nearby Park Rangers boarded our ship for the duration of this daylong tour of the bay. For nature lovers and photography buffs — this was an amazing day at sea. Fortunately the early fog lifted as we continued our very slow journey into the inlets that led to the glaciers reaching the sea. Recommend that you go topside of the ship or even better — set up your equipment on your private balcony. ,"October 16, 2018",Amazing Natural Wonders,44,"Franklin, Tennessee",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Cruising slowly through Glacier Bay National Park was glorious during the first half of the day while the sun was shining. Sailing near the coastline, hearing the national park ranger's commentary, spotting wildlife, watching nature unfold around every inlet, and sitting by the glacier face are all part of the wonderful experience. During lunch hour and afterwards our rain storm moved in and the scenery was less spectacular. Also we had cruised the inside passage many years ago and Hubbard Glacier was on our itinerary. That glacier face is many times larger, bluer ice, calves much more, and is better photo opportunity than Glacier Bay. However, overall Glacier Bay National Park has much more mountain scenery with hanging glaciers on the mountains which is by itself awesome.","October 11, 2018",Awesome while in sunshine,497,"Gatesville, Texas",4

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Our visit to Glacier Bay was on a cruise ship. We coasted (very slowly) through the park. Park Rangers boarded our ship to talk about the park and answer questions. This full day trip was majestic to say the least. We spotted whales, sea lions, sea otters and icebergs along the way and back. The Glaciers were spectacular. Even though we had a balcony with wonderful views, I strongly advise you go to the top of the ship as it is the only place to get a 360 degree panoramic view. Also, our ship stopped for an hour in areas so we could take in the view and get the best pictures.","October 9, 2018",Spectacular views,15,"Mobile, Alabama",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We visited this park by cruising with princess in late May from Seattle round trip. The scenery was beautiful through out the cruise: big snow capped mountains and mountains, many many powerful long and short water falls. When we were in the glacier bay national park, there were many seagulls were flying around. There were also many sea otters in the area, we could see many black dots emerged and disappeared without binocular. But we did see one just under our balcony, it was so up close, I could see everything very clearly for a quick 2 seconds, then he just disappeared into the water. The cruise was staying in the glacier area for 30 mins each side to let you experience ice calving. We first heard a huge sound because the ice is cracking, then saw a big chunk ice split from the glacier and drop into ocean, It was amazing.","October 7, 2018",amazing to hear and see ice calving,77,Minnesota,4
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Went with NCL Pearl. When we first started through, early in the morning, it was so foggy we could see NOTHING. I thought to myself: The sun is going to rise and it will burn off. Fortunately it did just that.We were fortunate that we got to see two separate arms – one of which we were told had only recently opened. The scenery was breath-taking though it was hellishly cold. The glaciers were amazing and we got to see and hear calving at glaciers on both arms. Interesting to see in real life, but kind of sad as it meant the glacier was shrinking.However, the stay was too short (about 4 hours) and we were far away (as the captain opted to slowly turn the massive boat around a couple of times at each location so everyone at every point on the boat could see). This necessitated us having to be far enough away so the whole massive ship could turn in circles. We only spent 10-20 minutes at each major glacier (turning in circles). I would have gladly cut off a couple of hours at Icy Point and Skagway to stay additional hours at Glacier Bay.Animals spotted by the naturalist include seals, coastal brown bear, otter, mountain goats, birds and a humpback whale. I saw all but the bear.Unfortunately, just as the seals all came out to sit on the ice – meaning it was only a matter of time before their predators started in, we turned and left. I would definitely like to go again – this time either with a ship that stayed longer or via a tour/private boat.It also would have been nice if NCL had actually used the large covered areas and tables they had set out on the bow viewing area to serve cocoa and coffee.","October 5, 2018",Great Park.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Glacier Bay was part of our 7 day cruise and it was an incredibly beautiful place, huge mountains covered with snow, mesmerizing views of the glaciers. On the way we spotted, bald eagles, sea lions, otters, whales and bears too. Keep a very good binoculars handy, you will need them. We were on Ms Westerdam ship from Seward to Vancouver and the second day was Glacier Bay tour.The glaciers are awesome. We witnessed ice cracking off one glacier it was very dramatic. Its is hard to get a scale of size. We were close to a glacier that is as high as a 20-30 story building. Was there as part of an Alaska cruise. This is one of the most beautiful natural sights on the earth. With a cup of hot chocolate in the hand we watched a magical land of ice go by, saw massive icebergs float by and sea lions play in the cold water.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"I thought I wrote a review of Glacier Bay last year when we went to Alaska...but it appears that I did not. The scenery all the way from the ranger station to the glaciers was spectacular! We saw quite a bit of the local wildlife along the way including a bear who was fishing for his/her lunch. All along the way, our ranger guide would provide narrative over the cruise ship's PA system as to what we were seeing, etc. It took a nice long time to get there, but we finally arrived at the area where the glaciers are located. We drove past the two less interesting looking glaciers and then our captain put the ship into a 360 degree spin for an hour in front of the Margerie Glacier. We stared in awe of this massive force of nature...we watched small calving occur (was really hoping for a big chunk to fall off but even the little ones were amazing to watch).

Our captain turned the ship so everyone on board had fantastic views of the glaciers. We had park rangers on board that gave very good descriptions of what we were seeing, particularly once we had passed Composite Island. They also made announcements of wildlife sightings.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Words cannot adequate describe the grandeur and the majesty of Glacier Bay. We were on a Holland American cruise and our wonderful captain sailed the ship up through the Sitakaday Narrows past mountains and coves into Glacier Bay itself. Once we passed Composite island, the real excitement began. We sailed past Reid Glacier and Lamplight glacier and entered John Hopkins Inlet. It was a picture perfect day with clear skies and bright sun. We were able to go into the inlet because the harbor seal pups had been weened. We approached John Hopkins Glacier and the ship stopped moving. We listened as the glacier crack and groan, sometimes making thundering noises like a ball being hit by a bat. We watched as the aquamarine ice calved and fell into the sea with a spine tingling rumble. Our captain then moved the ship 90 degrees to the right and very slowly 90 degrees to the left so everyone on the ship might have a good look at the glacier. The ice really IS blue. We then sailed back down John Hopkins and up Tarr Inlet to Margery Glacier which was equally beautiful. We witnessed calving there too. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before and somehow we are made to realize just how magnificent this world is and how we are just here for a short time and during that time, we need to protect the future of our planet, if not for ourselves, for our children and their children. Sailing back down we saw harbor seals floating on ice floes, stellar seals, oyster catchers, sea otters, and whales.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We started this amazing trip in Seattle with a friend. We spent 4 days tour the town and seeing the sites such as: The Space Needle, The Chihuly Museum, the Pop Culture museum, the Troll under the bridge, the Z Park, the water front, the Pike Place Market, Kerry Park, the Argosy boat cruise and much more. It really started us off fo an adventure we were so excited to get started on.We entered the Legend on pier 91 at 11:45 AM with no issues or delays. The check in was smooth and the welcome was tremendous. Our rooms weren't ready until 1:30 PM but that was known from the beginning. They had the buffet all setup and we enjoyed the scenery of the Seattle harbor.The first day was a sea day but we needed the downtime after running all over Seattle. The only downfall of the entire trip was the commercialized cities we visited, but we are veteran cruises and knew what to stay away from. Juneau was our first stop and the only port where we did not use Carnival for our tour. We used Harv and Marv's whale watching and what a great decision that was. We saw 14-15 whales, dolphins, seals, walruses and a glacier that was stunning in the sunlight during the evening hours.Skagway was next and it was an old looking western town full of plenty of shopping. We took the excursion on the Ultimate Yukon and White Pass Railway Adventure. This trip bused you into the Yukon to a small tourist trap village with lunch but yet fun to be there and afterwards there is a petting zoo and sled dogs to see. Then they took you to Carcrossing for a little more local shopping and then to the train which is the highlight of the tour. It took 1 1/2 hours to go back down the hill but it was worth every second. This is a must do....Third stop was Glacier Bay. BEAUTIFUL. And during this time of year you get to see bothe Glaciers in the area. Highly suggest the presentations by the park rangers that board the ship and the Naturalist that was part of the crew. Fantastic information and very helpful.Next stop was Sitka, small town but a lot of culture. We took the Carnival City Historical Tour. No history spoken about at all. But the stop at the Raptor Center made it all worth while. Only wish we could have gotten more history on the Historical Tour. LOLThen the last port was Ketchikan, this was really commercialized and I felt as if I was in the Caribbean. But again walk on pass these to get to Creek Crossing. This was a fantastic little street with history to meander through. We also took the Duck Boat ride from Carnival and it was funny and entertaining, and also very safe.The last day was at sea.We landed and disembarked in Vancouver, BC. We spent 2 days there and used Vancouver Lands Sea Tours and Adventures. Fantastic tours. The historical city tour and the Sea to Sky tour with the Deep Fjord Tour. GREAT, GREAT, GREAT!!!!!!The day before flying out of Seattle we took the Amtrak from Vancouver to Seattle. Again the ride was perfect and the scenery was fabulous. This is a must do. Business Class and ask for seat 3 or 5 for best views. Also have your US declaration card filled out before getting there, it will save you time.Our cabin stewart was Haru and he was great.Restaurant servers were Kamong, Heri and Made They were better than great.Crews director Jen was fun.And captain Giuseppe was fantastic.The Entertainment. WOW, Wow, Wow, Wow.....The best I've seen yet.I hope if anyone takes this cruise in the future look for the 1st or 2nd week in September so you can see both glaciers.

We really lucked out with the weather for our entire trip, but especially this portion on Aug 21st. One of the crew told us the weather the week before was terrible with near zero visibility. We arrived at the entrance to Glacier Bay early and there was quite a bit of fog, but that burned off pretty quickly. Clear, bright sunny skies with temps in the high 50's to upper 60's...perfect. The entire trip into the bay was one huge Kodak moment with eye-popping scenery everywhere you looked. Good opportunities for wildlife viewing, as well...bears, mountain goats, otters, seals, eagles, etc. As we got closer to the end of the bay, the weather started closing in and mist turned to a light rain. Still great views of the glaciers calving, however.There are other ways to enjoy the bay besides a cruise ship, e.g., kayak, small tour boat, helicopter, etc., but the cruise ship was pretty nice! This is on my A+++ list as a recommendation for anyone.","August 27, 2018",Can't think of enough adjectives!!!,42,"Wenatchee, Washington",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Our cruise ship spent the day in Glacier Bay. It took several hours to cruise 65 miles from the strait to the end of the bay (where the main glacier is). The Margerie Glacier has retreated so much that part of it is now on land; this means that there is not much calving going on (we saw a small piece fall). The face is about 200 feet tall and almost one mile wide. We spent one hour looking at the glacier, then left and another cruise ship took our place. Cruising in the bay, we saw sea lions, bald eagles, and mountain goats (small white dots in the distance). I have seen better glaciers elsewhere in the world. On the way out of the bay, we stopped at two other glaciers for a short while. The talk by a park ranger about her 10 day kayak trip was interesting. We were told by our captain that it was the best weather he has had in his many trips here -- it was sunny and mostly blue skies.","August 26, 2018","Glacier has retreated so much that it is partially on land, so not much calving",181,"Reno, Nevada",4

We did not see whales are seals but the sunny weather gave the Glacier colors of blue strips on the mountains. The weather was beautiful of 53 degrees with no rain at all.

We've never experienced anything like it and loved every minute. Especially the view of the Margerie Glacier from our cabin balcony. We were out on deck taking pictures, and the ship then turned (suppose they do that so port and starboard cabins are afforded the chance to see the Glacier from their balconies) so we went back down to our cabin and went out onto the balcony - the view of the Glacier was just awesome. A room with a view indeed! We even got to experience the Glacier calving, not once, but twice! The noise was like a massive clap of thunder. What a memorable experience it was!","August 21, 2018","Wonderful, Magical Experience",70,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",5

We saw sea lions - one floating on an iceberg. The glaciers: pictures do not describe the massiveness, the sound of ice breaking and splashing into the water, the blue of the ice, the green of the water. Dress for winter in layers. At times we were freezing and sometimes taking off layers. BTW, the group that went in the week before could not see the glaciers due to the fog.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We (family of parents and two teens) took the long boat ride into the park with the NPS guides. The boat itself was quite comfortable and our guide, Katy, was really wonderful. The food and hospitality on the ship were exceptional. I can't fault the NPS at all. But our weather was awful and we could hardly see anything. The main reason we traveled to Alaska was to see Glacier Bay and it was hidden behind fog and clouds. It rained every moment of our trip. I mean, I expected a lot of rain in Alaska but I hadn't considered the degree to which the poor weather would prevent us from actually seeing any of Alaska. So I gave this event a poor review only to warn people that you really don't want to go in August, which I believe is the rainiest month of the summer. I was so looking forward to this trip and it was really disappointing. It was also a very long trip, with A LOT of down time so I would not go with younger kids who could get pretty bored. Bring a book (or some knitting).","August 13, 2018",so disappointed by the weather on the boat ride,31,"Orinda, California",3
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We spent two nights at the lodge and took the boat trip which is essential to see the park. Really enjoyable day, quite a long day, Ranger on board to guide and provision of snacks included. The boat is small enough to get close to the shore and glaciers. Saw lots of wildlife, otters, puffins, bears on the shoreline. It was a really hot day but it was cold on the boat when you went outside so make sure you have lots of layers. We also walked a few of the shorter trails (saw a swimming bear) and watched the film in the visitor centre. Also attended the native house at the park and heard about the history of the local people who have always lived in the area. Really noticeable how strong the emphasis was in acknowledging the native people and their history in the area it was really good to see","August 12, 2018",Impressive,20,"Cardiff, Wales",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"As you enter into the park by cruise ship, ranger naturalists boarded our boat to tell us about the park and all its wonders. They also commentated the entire time in the park! We were treated to wonder views of glaciers and wildlife such as sea otters, sea birds,bears and mountain sheep. As we pulled up along several calving glaciers the park rangers spoke of how much of an expanse the glacier was both above and below the water. As we left the Bay we were treated to whale sightings on both sides of the ship. ","August 12, 2018",Glacier Bay,27,,5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We took the Alaska Marine ferry from Juneau (Auke Bay) to Gustavus on a Wednesday morning. It was a beautiful trip and we saw numerous otters and a humpback whale on the way. We arrived in Gustavus by noon. The Glacier Bay Lodge sent a complimentary shuttle to pick us up and take us to the National Park Lodge. We stayed the night in a nice room overlooking Bartlett Cove. The room was simple, but had everything we needed (no Wi-Fi). We had dinner in the dining room overlooking the beautiful cove. After dinner we attended an informative presentation by an Alaskan native in a beautiful tribal meeting house. The next day we took the National Park boat tour after a great buffet breakfast at the lodge. The tour lasted about 8 hours and we saw countless sea otters, puffins, sea lions, a humpback whale, and three different encounters with brown (grizzly) bears foraging for food on the shoreline. The boat approached each of these slowly and we just enjoyed watching nature’s beauty for a long period of time. In one instance, we saw a mother and her yearling cubs from 30-40 yards away. It was spectacular! We journeyed all the way up to the Marjorie and Grand Pacific glaciers. We sat silently and listened to the ice moan and grind while calving into the bay. We were back to the lodge by late afternoon where we shuttled back to the Gustavus airport to catch an Alaskan Airlines flight back to Juneau Thursday around dinner time. It was an amazing experience!","August 6, 2018",Wonderful Experience,1,"Orange County, Ca.",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Tip: Northern Lights Entertainment coupons affords a good economic deal for a combination of lodge and boat excursion.National Park Visitor CenterWe saw two good movies: 25-minutes “Beneath the Reflection” and 18-minutes“Forever Wild” in the quite good Visitor Center in the second floor of the main lodge building. The Visitor Center contains excellent displays spanning many subjects including fauna and animals. The rangers are very helpful, lead ranger talks and hikes, and are inspirations to Junior Ranger aspirants. If possible, attend the interesting and enlightening ranger interpretative talk in the Huna Tribal House down the Tlinget Trail. Also note other ""attractions"" along the Tlinget Trail.The 1.4 mile round trip “Forest Loop” Trail is delightful. Consider taking insect repellant. It is a rain forest environment. We also saw where wood is chopped in the nearby campground and tide kelp along the water path return.Lodge: The main lodge consists of a restaurant, gift shop, and large den for relaxing by a fireplace on the first floor and the National Park Visitor Center on the second floor. Wifi is in the lodge.Bedroom was adequate with full bathroom. Plenty of bedding and towels. The rooms are in groups along boardwalks in annexes with bedrooms near the main lodge. “Trevor” was willing and able to please; thank you for your help.Boat Excursion: Take layers! There is a National Park Ranger (“Nate Hughes” in our case) on board to enlighten passengers with area history, geology, wildlife, and, of course, glaciers. The ranger will also bestow Junior Ranger certificates and pins on board. Plenty of seats inside the catamaran to stay warm. There is small cafeen on board from which one also receives the included lunch. We saw a lot and very much enjoyed this relatively small boat; I think there were 90 passengers.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We cruised Glacier Bay with Princess. This was a most remarkable day. We saw sea otters, sea lions, orkas, and a mama bear with three cubs. While all of them were fascinating, the mama bear and her three cubs were special. The captain even stopped the ship while the bears were on the shore line. They even put on a "" show"" for us when one of he cubs refused to cross a small stream that mama and the other two cubs had crossed on their way back into the forest. Mama had to return and ""encourage"" this one to cross the stream. When he finally did cross, cheers rose from those of us on deck.Then we got the place where we could view the glacier.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Without a doubt Glacier Bay National Park was the most beautiful place I have ever seen. I was on a cruise ship, very early in the morning the rangers from Gustavus boarded our ship via a rope ladder and guided us into the park while speaking of the history and current conditions. They pointed out a lot of wildlife and were very entertaining. Although it is not typical from what I heard the weather was perfect clear and sunny yet very brisk in the morning. The glaciers are so big it’s hard to get a perspective. I strongly suggest you are up early to see the entire surrounding as you enter the park because once you are at the glaciers you will have missed the magnificence of the white peaked mountains and ice flows that are in every direction you look. A picture in no way can do it justice. The glaciers look so small compared to there surroundings yet the are on average 1-3 miles long across the face and 300-400 deer high but as your sitting right next to it on a cruise ship they don’t look big at all until you see an animal or person or small craft at the base of it to get a glimpse of the magnitude.

I'm someone who really dislikes the cold, and doesn't like spending summer time in fairly cold places, but seeing Glacier Bay this July really changed my tune. We sailed through Glacier Bay as part of an Alaskan cruise (Princess), and it really was a fantastic way to do it. The park rangers boarded our boat early in the morning, and did a narration all day that could be heard on all the outside decks. We bundled up, drank hot chocolate and sat/walked around outside to see all of the glaciers. It's so peaceful, quiet and stunning! We also saw a lot of wildlife like orca whales and sea otters.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Having cruised Alaska’s Inside Passage with and without a visit to Glacier Bay National Park, we highly recommend making sure your Alaska Cruise includes Glacier Bay. While all of Alaska is amazing, Glacier Bay is truly special and a step above the rest.The night before your visit, park brochures and information on the next day’s activities are distributed to the staterooms. Early in the morning, while most are usually still asleep, the cruise ship enters the bay and rangers board the ship and set-up a temporary visitor center in a public area where additional materials, the park’s passport stamp, and rangers to answer any questions, are available. The rangers also provide narration over the ship’s intercom throughout the day while in the bay, usually about 10 hours, and assist in spotting wildlife. Other rangers hold activities including a Junior Ranger program.While cruising Glacier Bay, you will be treated to an abundance of spectacular mountain scenery, including valley glaciers, and a number of tidewater glaciers. The ship will also navigate through the ice to approach a tidal glacier, usually Margerie Glacier, and remain close for almost an hour, as the ship slowly cruises by and turns around, allowing all to see the magnificent beauty of an enormous tidewater glacier with a great opportunity to see and hear new icebergs being calved.Wildlife is abundant and chances of spotting mountain goats, bears, bald eagles, puffins, many other birds, harbor seals, sea lions and sea otters is excellent, especially near the end of the day as the ship cruises by South Marble Island. Shortly after cruising by the island, the rangers depart the ship which then cruises into the sunset, exiting the bay through Icy Straight, a humpback whale hot spot, making for a fitting end to a day not soon forgotten.","July 25, 2018",Glacier Bay by Cruise Ship,3757,"Avon, Ohio",5

And this place is just as beautiful as we remembered. Of course, Margerie Glacier is the star with its 250 foot-high face and continuous calvings.

They toured the bay with us and gave intermittent lectures over the sound system of the ship describing the glaciers, their history and the wildlife on shore and in sea. The bay was one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences. Listen to the glaciers as they break apart.

The towns we visited were overrun with cruise tourists, with a minimum 4 ships in port each day. But if you can book excursions out of the towns it is great. A beautiful part of the world with amazing history and lifestyles to observe.The glacier bay itself is spectacular and I feel blessed to have been able to visit it. The talks onboard assisted with history and made it that much more interesting. Very sad to think it will continue to disappear, so worth seeing if you can.

Weather was not the greatest, unlike the sunny day we had at Hubbard so it took away some of the awe that we should feel. Good thing that we had a balcony so we were able to stay dry and warm instead of being out on deck. There were many seagulls flying around the ship that day which added some lively touches to the beautiful glacier.","July 2, 2018",Beautiful!,312,California,4

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We entered Glacier Bay on our cruise ship. I understand only 2 ships are allowed per day. If you are taking a cruise, please make sure this natural wonder is on your ship's itinerary. Anyway, at the mouth of the bay we took on-board a Park Ranger who gave us a commentary of what we were seeing and the history of the glacier for the entire day. A ranger must accompany larger ships. This was a super bonus. The day was our most spectacular of all on the cruise...seeing the amazing 15,000+ snow-capped mountains on both sides of the bay, several glaciers, wildlife in and around the water, and, of course, the infamous Marjorie Glacier at the of the bay. We actually pivoted and remained stationary in front of the Glacier for almost an hour admiring it. Glacier Facts: 250 ft high, 1 mile wide, 100 feet deep and 21 miles long. Moves 6 feet per day. Glacier Bay National Park, the size of Connecticut, is the 2nd largest wilderness in the world after Antarctica.BTW...I can't believe people were down-rating this national wonder by the type of excursion they took.

You could see the ice breaking off and crashing into the water before you could hear it. It's incredible to believe that the entire bay was once all under ice less than 300 years ago.

Hiking higher through the wooded area (called the ""meadows"" ) to see the glacier is only for those fit enough to do so--it is much steeper. My husband had difficulty but made it that far.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Glacier Bay is awe-inspiring when you see the sheer size and number of the glaciers. Cruising on a cruise ship down the bay provides a 360 view, and there is wildlife all over (we saw bears, otters, whales breaching, goats, and eagles). The nature of this national park means there are almost no people around except those on boats and ships on the water, so all the scenery is pristine. You can watch Margerie Glacier calving and hear the booms as the ice hits the water. The amazon part is all of Glacer Bay was one big glacier in 1750 that has since receded and created the bay with lots of glaciers coming to the water's edge. Sad part is seeing how many glaciers have receded far enough away from the water that you can't see them anymore.","June 28, 2018",One of the best national parks,68,"Lehi, Utah",5

Nothing can prepare you for the size of the glaciers, the remoteness, calmness, purity or silence of the environment. I travelled to Glacier Bay as part of a week long Inside Passage cruise, only 2 ships are allowed inside the national park each week, to protect & preserve the natural environment. I was lucky enough to spend the whole day in the national park - our ship stopped completely for 1hr directly in front of one of the Glaciers & the captain opened the bow doors on two decks to give us an unobstructed view.There was plenty of wildlife; I saw Orca, Porpoise, Seals, Sea Otters and a Bald Eagle on my journey. Definitely bring a camera, sunglasses and dress in layers, it was 70c during my visit but the temperature dropped the nearer we got to the glaciers.If you plan to do nothing else or want the ‘one place’ to never miss on your bucket list, this is it!","June 28, 2018","Breathtaking, better than any David Attenborough documentary!",8,"Leicester, United Kingdom",5

We were able to get quite close to Margerie Glacier and because it was so sunny, we could see the blue in the glacier. (I never knew about this.)

It is amazing and majestic. When at the Glacier that moves look to your right to what looks like a barren mounded area and tell me if you do not expect to see a dinosaur coming over the ridge (the only thing missing from this awesome site to behold).

Our children surprised us with a generous down payment for the Gold Princess cruise for our 50th wedding anniversary in Dec. 2017 which we used towards this dream trip. We sailed on the Golden Princess up what looked like very narrow fjords to experience face on to these giant wonders of nature. Some of which are in danger of disappearing due to global warming. We had a balcony cabin on the starboard side and this is the direction the ship turned to allow us a great view from our room. All together we slowly cruised past Margerie Glacier, John Hopkins Glacier, and Lamplugh Glacier, All together there are about 12 glaciers within the park boundary. Only two cruise ships are allowed to sail into this park on any given day so that the environment will not be disturbed too much.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"This is a truly wonderful part of the part of the world. Lots of wildlife to be seen, mountains and glaciers. We accessed the park by cruise ship and sailed up Glacier Bay to see the Margerie, Grand Pacific and John Hopkins Glaciers. The ship does a slow (about an hour) turn at the Margerie and Grand Pacific Glaciers. The Margerie is most obvious glacier and the most spectacular as it is actively calving. The Grand Pacific is very dirty and is receding and not many people realize it is there. Some people were disappointed when the glacier calved as they were expecting to see huge icebergs being formed. When the glacier calves, large chunks of ice break off and plunge into the water to form small floating masses of ice. If you are hoping to see huge icebergs such as those seen off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador or in the Antarctic, you should lower your expectations. The John Hopkins Glacier is also a beautiful glacier but the ship does not spend as much time there.There is wildlife to be seen on the trip up the bay and I have seen bear, eagles, seals, mountain goats and otters on the passage. A pair of binoculars is of help. There were naturalists on board to help interpret the sightings. A beautiful place to cruise to. If you go hopefully the weather will co-operate.

And NO, I’m not taking about the likes of Santa’s magic, that of the Charmed trio or even Sabrina the Teenage Witch’s BS magic! I’m taking about real magic; the kind that lifts your spirits, makes you smile and even question whether what you’re seeing is real!This HAS to be one of the most beautiful places on Earth. I mean, this humble planet we live on has some pretty spectacular sights, but Glacier Bay is Simply jaw-dropping. Putting into perspective our own role on Earth, the awesome might of the ice and the roar as it drops forces you to succumb to Nature and all its greatness. In this vast icy expanse of beauty, you’ll get up close with wildlife (yes I did see a whale), get in bed with a landscape as old as the dinosaurs and have the picturesque imagery forever imprinted in your mind. I did a whole loads of great stuff on my Alaskan cruise, but this trip was a life-changer for me! And it will be for you too! The pictures I post won’t even do the place justice, let alone my words, so go with your gut on this and book yourself a trip here.

The estimate depth of the ice below water was around 600ft.This time around the glacier has receded to 3 miles from us near the shore. The total height of the glacier is only about 300 ft.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We cruised Glacier Bay National Park on the Holland America Noordam in late September. It was one of the most stunning days of our lives. We spent all day out on the bow of the ship as we watched one glacier after another glide by with breathtaking beauty. The blues of the glaciers contrasted with the greens of the water, the greys of the cliffs, and the aquamarines of the sky to produce a kaleidoscope of colour that could not be photoshopped to be more beautiful. If you are considering an Alaskan cruise, you would not go wrong to go with Holland America or Princess solely for the reason that they are allowed to cruise through Glacier National Park with park rangers coming on board to describe what you are seeing. In addition to the landscape, we also saw a humpback whale, a couple of bears, a few Dahl sheep, and so forth, but the stars of the day were the glaciers. On this day, the spawning had ended in the little area where the Johns Hopkins Glacier dwells so we were able to go down into that area. It was stunning. I would recommend a cruise in mid-September for this reason. We were on a cruise that began on September 17 in Seward and headed south, hitting Glacier Bay on the second day. It was wonderful timing for many reasons, one of the chief of which was seeing the Johns Hopkins Glacier.

I do not enjoy cruising (especially, I have discovered, with Holland America!) so was not particularly excited about this leg of the trip. I am so glad we did it though, because the day at Glacier Bay was pure magic. Anything that can bring a cruise liner of 2500+ thousand people to almost complete silence for several hours has to be something very powerful. We went in June, only the second cruise of the season, so it was still pretty cold but the decks were full of people standing in awe of what they were seeing. We were lucky to have a brilliant, sunny day.Holland America had National park rangers aboard who gave a commentary (not continuous, only when there was something to say) which added to the experience.We took a million photos that day, but none of them translate what we experienced.

Unfortunately, the weather was against us and for much of the morning we saw little due to dense fog and it was cold, wet and windy on deck. The Ranger on board gave a commentary and was extremely enthusiastic. As if by magic, as we approached Margerie Glacier the sky cleared and the captain turned off the engine and set the ship to rotate slowly and silently to allow everyone to have sight and sound of the occasional calving. As the mist lifted further you could see the extent of the glacier up the valley. We proceeded to the Johns Hopkins glacier, an impressively wide glacier that is advancing, and the Lamplugh glacier. It was a privilege to spend even a brief period of time in this World Heritage Site, a place of raw beauty and natural wilderness that we shared with sea otters, seals, birds and a bear.","September 30, 2017",Tidewater glaciers.,285,"West Midlands, United Kingdom",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Our only regret about the day in Glacier Bay was that it was at the beginning of our cruise as everything else was compared to it.Glacier Bay was quite simply astoundingly beautiful. As we entered the bay it was quite foggy giving some wonderful opportunities for photography. As we cruised through the fog was lifting such that by the time we reached the first of the glaciers it was completely clear with wonderful light. Our first stop was for the Margerie Glacier where we spent around an hour circling very close to the face of the glacier. We then sailed past another to the John Hopkins Glacier (only accessible for part of the year due to breeding seals) where we spent another 45 minutes. Throughout the voyage & especially at the glaciers we had a running commentary from a local ranger. We also saw a fair amount of wildlife including sea otters, seals, eagles and a couple of distant sightings of bears.Glacier Bay is a protected area & a maximum of two ships are allowed in each day under strict ranger control so there was no distraction from other vessels.

Our cruise ship (Ruby Princess) stayed at the Margerie Glacier for at least an hour, if not more. The glacier calved many times and, although some would say it's just ice floating off the glacier, it seemed soooo much more. It was peaceful and then noisy when the glacier calved. The majesty of God's glory was so evident as we looked at His beauty. We could also hear other glacier's calving throughout the time we were there.

The ship commenced its 360 degree rotation of the bay. WOW what an experience. We stood on our balcony watching the glacier with binoculars and cameras ready.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"As the Holland America shop Noordam entered Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve, a launch carrying National Park Service rangers came out to meet up with our ship about 6:30 AM. I watched the process from our verandah. The rangers were onboard all day.The National Park Service rangers brought with them official park merchandise, park brochures, plenty of Passport to Your National Parks books for sale, and the Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve cancellation stamps for the passport. From the rangers, we learned that President Calvin Coolidge proclaimed the area around Glacier Bay a national monument under the Antiquities Act In February 1925. President Jimmy Carter expanded it. In 1978, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) enlarged the national monument by 523,000 acres (2116.5 km2) on December 2, 1980; and, in the process created Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve.Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve occupies the northernmost section of southeastern Alaska. It is mostly wilderness. There are well over a thousand tidewater and terrestrial glaciers. There are seven tidewater glaciers in the park. Both types have been thinning for decades. One glacier that is advancing is the Johns Hopkins Glacier. We got a really good view of the Johns Hopkins Glacier. The glacier was 12 miles long. The glacier is dwarfed by Mount Wilbur and Mount Orville behind it.When we arrived at Marjorie Glacier, a ranger announced facts about it. It was about ¾ of mile wide. The was a section to the left that looked like an igloo with a perfect semi-circular hole cut into it at the waterline. It was pretty cool. The ship’s captain did doughnuts in front of it for about an hour. During that time, most people were on the outside decks to witness the glacier calve twice. The calves were not overly large, so we did not hear any thunderous roars as the calves broke off and fell into the bay. The sound was more like very faint, distant thunder. Seeing the glaciers was a rare sight and experience that we will long remember from this once-in-a-lifetime trip. We rate Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve at 5.0. We highly recommend taking a cruise that goes to through this national park which became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979.If you found this review helpful, please click THANK below.","September 4, 2017",THE WONDERS OF GLACIER BAY NATIONAL PARK,4643,"Dover, New Hampshire",5

The views were simply stunning with the shades of blue showing from the ice. Playing between the mini icebergs in the bay were seven sea otters. We’ve done an Alaska cruise before but never was Glacier Bay included. This year Glacier Bay was a top priority when booking this cruise and were so glad we did.

Small icebergs were plentiful in the bay and it was pretty cold out on deck but I wouldn't have gone inside for anything. Bring a warm hat and gloves that allow you to still work your camera. Layers for warmth will help you stay outside. The crew served hot chocolate on the bow which also helped.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,The beautiful blue colour of the glacier is something you need to see first hand. It is a great stop from a cruise ship. Hearing and seeing the ice calving is fantastic. There are some great waterfalls along the bay as well. Would recommend having a balcony cabin or if not make friends with someone who has a balcony they can share the view.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Glacier Bay is perhaps the most beautiful place in all of Alaska. Our Princess Cruise boat arrived at the Bay early in the morning and approached Margerie Glacier by 9:30am. The weather was unusually clear and there was a perfect view of Fairweather Mountain in the distance. The glaciers were so much larger than expected. The sun poured across the uneven face of the glacier revealing white caverns with blue emanating deep from within.As the boat rotated 180 degrees to turn around, we watched in awe as a thundering sound echoed across the water following a large chunk of the glacier face calving into the water.Later we travelled South towards the John Hopkins and Lamplugh Glaciers. Each was majestic and evidence of the grandeur and power of nature. It was sad to learn that 95% of the glaciers in Alaska are receding.Overall, the experience was absolutely amazing and a highlight of our trip to Alaska.","August 27, 2017",Epic Glacier Bay Cruise,1,"Seattle, Washington",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Not to be missed, the closest you will get to a glacier, other then the expensive trips that land you on a glacier. This glacier face only accessible by boat, most see it as part of a cruise line stop. We did it with Carnival - the most memorable part of our trip.This glacier is still growing, so you are virtually guaranteed to see calving ice, and we saw some spectacular pieces fall into the sea. The cruise up the Glacier Bay to the terminus of the Bay is fantastic. You'll see lots of glaciers as you go, stark, beautiful mountains, snow capped in many places. If you have a good park ranger on board, like we did, (thanks Carnival), they will point out bears, sea lions, elusive mountain goats, sea otters, and all kinds of other wildlife.Very important - bring binoculars, and/or a camera with telephoto lens, and lots of warm layers of clothing. Our tour up and then back out of the Bay was over 4 hours, and we spent all of it out on deck for the best viewing of either side.Our captain held the ship at the final calving glacier for over an hour so we could capture the raw beauty of nature at work.

Nat'l Park Rangers boarded our ship to teach us about the ecosystems of Glacier Bay and point out different wildlife, if present. This is why I say ""Bring Binoculars"". I didn't have any & it was impossible to see the wildlife present with the naked eye. We spent the day either on the top deck or on our balcony as we cruised into the bay. It was cold & at times windy. If the sun isn't out, I am guessing it would have been cooler. I'm talking 50's - 60's temps. Beautiful, beautiful sites!

We arrived early in the morning and cut through dense fog on our way in, but cleared away as we approached the massive glaciers. Our ship, the Norwegian Sun, went about as far as it could to get up close with the John Hopkins and Margerie Glaciers. Margerie was putting on a show, creaking, cracking, then calving with thunderous booms and huge splashes before crashing into the water making large rings of waves. Gorgeous chunks of ice, some as large as a house, of multiple colors, floated past our ship. On the way out we sailed past Lamplugh ""The Blue"" Glacier, it was quite beautiful. Also on the way out, seals and otters were thick in the water. We saw one bald eagle, some cormorants and hundreds of seagulls with black tipped wings, they could be heard for miles.

We spent about an hour there and the ship did a complete circle in the inlet so everyone could see if from a great angle. We could see if from our balcony and it calved(dropped ice) while we were taking pictures of it(see photo). There were ice bergs in the water the closer you got to the glacier and you could see seals and birds hitching a ride. We then sailed to Johns Hopkins Inlet to see Lamplugh Glacier and John Hopkins Glacier which is actually growing not retreating. The National Park only allows two cruise ships per day to enter and a naturalist from the Park must be on board as you sail into Glacier Bay. It was so exciting to see the Glaciers up close and the blue colors are amazing.,"July 27, 2017",Really Beautiful!,213,"Orangevale, California",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"As we sailed closer to the bay we had our first glimpses of icebergs. They floated, assorted sizes and colours. Some looked dirty and they were, this was because they had been closest to the side of the banks as the glacier slowly descended to the sea. Then we saw them - glaciers - magnificent, ice flows. We heard what sounded like thunder and realised that it was an iceberg calving, unseen by us, higher in the mountains. Than we heard a boom and with that a massive chunk of ice broke off the glacier and fell to float in the bay. I never thought that I'd be able to hear and see these wonders of nature.","July 26, 2017",ICEBERGS AHEAD,123,"Redcar, United Kingdom",5

The Rangers had established a teaching module for passengers with full description of the entire region with pamphlets and various print and DVD materials.Look up Jaw Point where the ship turns to face a glacier in front rising up several hundred feet from the surface of the Bay, with various seals and otters swimming around and Eagles, Terns and other birds flying overhead - truly mesmeric.

This was really the only day of our week that we saw any of the huge ships, as for the rest of our itinerary we were in small coves that they couldn't reach.Glacier Bay was very impressive. The only slight issue was that, due to weather, we weren't able to collect our guide until the morning, so that meant we missed our morning kayaking, but it couldn't be helped.The glaciers are, of course, very impressive - I particularly liked Lamplugh the Blue; and we had some good wildlife spottings too - sea lions, sea otters, bears, wolves and tiny, tiny sheep hiding up on the cliffs! A few of our mad fellow adventurers even did 'The Polar Plunge' - yep, jumping in right in front of the glacier! While it wasn't for me, it was good fun to watch.All in all, Glacier Bay is a 'must' if on a cruise of Alaska, and try to pick a small cruise if you really want to experience the wildness and beauty of the place.","July 20, 2017",Un-Cruise your way to Glacier Bay,224,wolverhampton,5

Able to see glaciers (calving, walk on, explore), wildlife (bear, otters, sea lions, WHALES!!, porpoises, new birds for us. Did I say whales??? There is not much cooler than watching a whale for an hour breaching, fin slapping, diving, spy hopping). Dropped anchor at night in coves. Able to dinghy in to explore from the boat to land. Very few boats. A few HUGE cruise ships, but they are limited to 2/day MAX in the Bay. Wonderful.","June 24, 2017",WOW! Like having a private park!,64,"Madison, Wisconsin",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We spent the better part of the day cruising Glacier Bay on the MS Noordam. We purposely booked a balcony (veranda) room on the fantail (back of the ship) for this day. If you are going on a cruise ship for this itinerary, get a balcony cabin on the fantail. After three days of rainy weather, the sun came out for our Glacier Bay cruise and it was spectacular! We cruised up the Tarr Inlet to the Grand Pacific (3 miles wide) and Margerie (1 mile wide) Glaciers. Margerie is the featured glacier of the trip and the boat rotated 180 degrees slowly for everyone to get a look. Having the rear balcony cabin gave us an extended view of the glacier without fighting anyone else for a view or photos.We then cruised to the Johns Hopkins inlet for a more distant view of the Johns Hopkins Glacier and a closer look at the Lamplugh Glacier. The cruise included spectacular views of the Fairweather Range and 15,300 foot Mt Fairweather.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"The Margery Glacier is a massive, historical and wondrous piece of ice. I didn't know quite what to expect when I was told I'd see a glacier ""calve"". To see and hear a glacier up close when it loses a huge chunk of ice is more spectacular than I would have imagined. The noise is something you have to experience to believe. Everything is peaceful, and then this thunderous crack and enormous splash, then back to calm serenity. I experienced Glacier Bay from the comfort of a ship balcony. It was a cool but sunny day, making a feast for the eyes wherever they roamed. I enjoyed hearing the nature guide describe the smaller chunks floating in the water. She called them bergies and growlers and explained how to tell them apart. I saw a Seal mom and pup resting on ice until they were swept off by a wave. There were many otters swimming in the water nearby. Oh the cuteness! I heard others who were spotting moose and mountain goat in the area as well. If you can spend a couple hours in the bay and just be still and appreciate the quiet of this beautiful place, you will create a memory that will last a lifetime. I chose not to take pictures because I didn't want to see anything through a lens. My daughter did take several pictures and caught an eagle midflight with the mountain as the back drop. there were no bad pictures to be had. I'm definitely glad I wore my water proof jacket as it did get pretty misty. Somehow I managed to still get sunburned. Wear SPF! The fresh air and beauty will leave you relaxed and refreshed.","June 22, 2017",nature in all its glory,49,"Maple Valley, Washington",5

We passed the favored sunning spots for the sea lions and shortly after the ranger pointed out a bear on the shore, and then a family of mountain goats. The bear and goats were only little blobs to the naked eye; good binoculars and a 350+ zoom are essential. The farther we traveled into the bay, the more beautiful the day and the scenery became. Our captain made the decision to visit Marjorie Glacier before Johns Hopkins. By then the fog had cleared and the sun was coming out. Gorgeous!  We tried viewing the bay from a number of spots on the ship, and in the end, decided that our own balconies had the best view. No jostling for a view, and the ship does a full turn so everyone can see.  The sun was fully out by the time we got to Johns Hopkins.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"As one of our nation's premier and largest (2.6 million acres) national parks, Glacier Bay National Park offers more than most people can experience in a life-time all centered around exciting adventures. Most of the activities focus on outside sports such as fishing, hunting, kayaking (the best way to experience the park) and boating. Photography is a must because it offer outstanding beauty.Glacier Bay is was formed by rapidly retreating glaciers that leave deep and narrow fjords forming protected inland water perfectly suited for kayaking exploration (keep in mind the water is cold and the weather turns so you should be prepared).Gustavus serves as a starting point and park head quarters, and may be reached by plane (frequent service from Juneau and Seattle) or boat (Alaska Marine Ferry System). There are charter boats and large ferry boats that make the trip into the bays, and serve as a way to take your kayak to the starting point such as Seabree Island. The park headquarters also offers hotel style rooms that are a bit rustic, but accompanied by a terrific restaurant.If you decide to kayak, make certain you bring all the necessary items including communications equipment (satellite telephone) in the event of an emergency. Know, this is a true wilderness experience and you might not receive help any time soon.Also, everything is on your own. Your house is a tent that must withstand the elements. Your vehicle is a kayak you paddle and progress is at the mercy of the tides. Toilet and bathing facilities are all of nature, but ensure you practice environmentally proper procedures. Freshwater is often glacier melt and can be quite cold for showers, but heating water means you must carry much more fuel.Since there are hundreds of miles of paddling opportunities, plan your route carefully and with the help of park officials. Personally, Adams Inlet and Riggs/McBride Glaciers will always be special.Have an incredible time and feel free to ask questions.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We visited Glacier Bay on a recent cruise. There are several options for Glaciers and I think this bay is a top choice. You have to see the views from the water which means being on a cruise, renting a boat, or joining an excursion. For the best views, make your way up to Margies Glacier and the Great Pacific Glacier. They're at the end of the longest bay and that's really where the vistas are. As the ranger explained, you go back in time as you get deeper into the bay. At the mouth of the bay, near the ranger station, the glacier has receded longer ago. As a result, the geology and vegetation have had more time to change. Deeper in the glacier, it's more pristine. And the mountains are much more abrupt. In fact, some of the surrounding peaks soar more than 10,000 from the water's edge. Also Maggies Glacier was where we saw calving. The glacier moves about 7 feet per day so the chances are pretty good that you'll see some action.","May 15, 2017",Spectacular Views the Deeper You Go,225,"Danville, California",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"One of its kind, Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve (冰川灣國家公園) is located in the Hoonah-Angoon Census Area (胡納-安貢人口普查區), Southeast Alaska, Alaska, USA. Its population was 2,150 in 2010. It was designated as a National Monument on Feb 26, 1925. It was designated as a National Park & Preserve on Dec 2, 1980 and as a World Heritage site in 1986. The national park and preserve covers 1,328,583 hectares (3,283,000 acres). It was a single, large tidewater glacier that covered all of Glacier Bay 250 years ago. Today it has retreated 60 miles to the head of the bay. There are over 50 named glaciers, seven of which are active tidewater glaciers that calve icebergs into the sea. Most of the park's glaciers originated between elevations from 2,440 to 4,570 m (8,000 to 15,000 ft).We took the cruise ship to visit this amazing site in July. It is best accessed by cruise ships for tourists because the area is vast with only 16 km (10 mi) trails and it is preserved. Eighty nine percent of tourists visit Glacier Bay via cruise ship and 3% by tour boats in 2015 according to the statistics. A unique benefit when you take the cruise ship is the rangers from National Park Service are onboard the ship and share their knowledge about the Glacier Bay and its ecosystem. This was the first time I have seen so many glaciers in a single trip. The cruise ship we took was the 115,875 ton Diamond Princess. It was incredibly amazing to see that such a big ship could approach so close to the edge of glaciers. We entered the bay from south and the rangers boarded the cruise ship here in the early morning around 6 am when most of the passengers were not awake yet. It was the only entrance to discover the wonder of the glaciers. We spent the whole day here to enjoy the amazing landscape and nature in Glacier Bay. The first tidewater glacier highlight was the Reid Glacier, followed by Lamplugh Glacier. The ship turned left to the Johns Hopkins Inlet where we saw Topeka Glacier on the right and John Hopkins Glacier straight ahead with a small portion of Gilman Glacier on the left side of the John Hopkins Glacier. The last and major glacier highlights were Gland Pacific Glacier and Margerie Glacier at the Tarr Inlet. Personally, I liked the Margerie Glacier the most because it had the almost vertical 76.2 m (250 ft) height at its face. The Gland Pacific Glacier has a 3.2 km (2 mi) width which is the widest among the glaciers we visited in the national park. We ended this 10 hour glacier adventure around 4 pm.We believe all the glaciers in the world are receding / thinning in the recent years due to the global warming but here at Glacier Bay National Park, the Johns Hopkins and Margerie Glaciers have a different story. Johns Hopkins is advancing and thickening. Margerie Glaciers is stable. We need to protect these great natures and keep our earth healthy.","January 6, 2017",Discover the Wonder of the Glaciers via Cruise Ship,666,"Taipei, Taiwan",5

The ship passed slowly in and out of 2 inlets, and did a very slow rotation in each of the ""cul-de-sacs"" so that all sides of the ship could get a spectacular view of the glaciers up close. Visiting Glacier Bay is the best reason to take an Alaskan Cruise.","November 27, 2016",Highlight of Alaska Cruise,29,"Carmel, Indiana",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Our cruise ship sailed gracefully up the bay. We even encountered a whale on our way in on this morning. The skies cleared and the day became bright, just perfect for viewing all of the glaciers to be seen. Obviously there were a couple of ""stand out"" glaciers but if you care to take in the whole bay, you will see many glaciers large and small. Even a brown bear to be seen if you were quick enough. A good period of time spent just taking in the view made it well worth while.","November 24, 2016",An absolute majestic place to visit,25,"Christchurch, New Zealand",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,Fabulous views! It is mesmerizing for all the ages. Of course it is a bit fresh but the air is super clean. However the amount of glaciers is way less than it was 10 years ago for example. It is experience of a lifetime! ,"November 4, 2016",STUNNING!,37,,5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"As it was just after Septemeber 1, our mid sized cruise ship was permitted to sail the entire length of Glacier Bay National Park. The weather was warm, bright and sunny for the first day of our visit which made for a unbelievably fantastic day in this preserve.. This was the absolute highlight of a 2 week Alaskan cruise!!!. Our second visit the following day started out with heavy fog and mist for several hours, then clearing, which did not take away from the experience what so ever! It was just unbelievable to hear, first, then see the calving of the glacier. The blue tinges of the ice were unreal. With the help of binoculars, we were able to see seals on an ice flow and watch an otter play in the calm, water dotted with chunks of ice. The commentary by the Park Rangers was fantastic!!! If you are adventurous, you can visit this magnificent National ""Park"" in a small boat,zodiak or kayak. One of the best experiences ever!!!!!","October 29, 2016",Surreal Experience!,167,Ontario,5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"I'd heard amazing things about Glacier Bay, and it was at the top of our Alaskan list - we specifically chose a cruise that would spend two days there. It delivered, even more than I'd hoped for. We had the chance to spend a few hours on land at Bartlett Cove, enjoying the Visitor's Center and a short hike. Then we sailed all the way to Margerie Glacier - the bay was even longer than I'd realized. Watching (and hearing) calving icebergs from the tidewater glaciers is quite an experience. We also saw a bunch of wildlife - humpback whales, seals, sea otters, mountain goats, a bear, puffins, and cormorants, among others. The scenery was also beautiful - glaciers, water, mountains, and we were lucky enough to have blue skies.","October 24, 2016",Bigger and more beautiful than I expected,396,"Portland, Oregon",5

The weather was ideal.....very cold but clear blue skies.The National Park Rangers who join each cruise ship and provide commentary and answer questions are really great and add a lot to the experience.Every climate change denier should go to Glacier Bay and see what we have already have lost and what we stand to lose.","October 23, 2016",World Class,68,"Wakefield, United Kingdom",5

The park rangers were so incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. Just to see the glaciers up close...I had no idea that they could be blue, white or brown. I love learning new things. If you can go to Alaska, you MUST go to Glacier Bay. These beautiful structures may not be around forever. They are shrinking due to to global warming. See them while you l can.","October 6, 2016",WOW!!!,3,,5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Cruise pax should pick their itinerary carefully. Tracy Arm glacier viewing of the twin Sawyer Glaciers almost always requires an expensive add on excursion.However, if you pick a cruise that does scenic cruising at either Hubbard Glacier or Glacier Bay? Your jaw dropping views are included in your fare. I've seen both, and they're hard to compare. There is far more variety of what you see at Glacier Bay. However, if you watch to see, hear, and photograph calving? I suggest Hubbard Glacier in July, when I've seen it very active. But I love the variety that Glacier Bay provides - the tidewater glaciers, the magnificent mountain views, the shallows filled with bright blue glacial silt, and growlers and bergy bits of ice floating in the waters. This visit to Glacier Bay? I was stunned by how visibly Margerie Glacier has shrunk. I have a vintage artist's postcard of this same view from roughly 50 years ago, and - OH MY! The difference!This is a fragile ecosystem, and admissions to Glacier Bay are strictly limited. I can't recommend this destination highly enough as a living, changing example of Mother Nature in all her splendour.

We were lucky with the weather....bright sunny day, no wind and very calm seas.We were also fortunate to see some brown bears foraging along the sea shore. Mother and 3 cubs were oblivious of our presence...but not of the male bear sneaking up on them. As soon as mother bear became aware of father bear..it was on with daddy bear being chased away from the 3 little bears.Bald Eagles, Puffins ( 2 types) sea otters, Orcas , Dall Porpoises, Sea Lions and many other sea birds were seen.The ranger on board gave an excellent summary of all that we were seeing.Lunch was enjoyable and quite filling.The real highlight of the day...amongst many... was to get up close and friendly with a magnificent glacier. It was carving constantly with each breakaway sounding either like thunder or a gunshot. The captain gave us plenty of time to observe all this. The clicking of cameras all around me never stopped.A truly wonderful scenic day...a day not to be missed by anyone contemplating visiting this wonderful part of Alaska.","October 1, 2016",Stunning Scenery and amazing wildlife,66,"Strathbogie, Australia",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We spent a day in Glacier Bay on a Holland America cruise. Despite reading up on the park we were stunned by the expanse and beauty of the space. Park Rangers came aboard to provide helpful, understandable commentary. Two of the most spectacular glaciers seen were Grand Pacific which sweeps down like a ski piste to the water. Like so many glaciers the Grand Pacific is receding but the Johns Hopkins bucks the trend and is slowly advancing. It has more of a wall from which lumps crash noisily into the water regularly. Sailing through mini icebergs is a thrilling experience as is the indifference of the colonies of harbour seals which bask on the floes near Johns Hopkins.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,We went into the park via cruise ship. The cruise ship took us right up the John Hopkins Glacier. It was by the far the coolest thing we seen on the trip. We passed seals and sea lions on little ice chunks as we got closer. When chunks of the glacier fall into the ocean it sounds like thunder from the amount of weight falling into the water.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Actually no words can justify the experience. You have to be there to feel it. To come face to face (as close as 800m) with a glacier inspires so much respect for nature. Watching and hearing the ice break and tumble into the sea is awesome.I'd say all major cruise ships go there and I'd guess the captains are all pretty good at giving you that wonderful opportunity of viewing from both sides of the ship and taking lots of photos.We finished ours on 17 September and although the weather was a bit grey and misty, we couldn't complain because we achieved the main goal of our cruise - a close encounter with the glaciers. The Star Princess we were on even sailed all the way to John Hopkins Glacier, which according to the captain, only opened for touring after 1st September and only ever had 6000 visitors before our group.One bit of travel advice, do wear warm layers and bring a rain jacket. Most important of all, DO NOT FORGET TO BRING BINOCULARS.","September 20, 2016","magnificent, austere, majestic",8,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We were extremely fortunate on our cruise with Holland America that the day we spent in Glacier Bay was fine, sunny and clear (the same cruise the previous week had to put up with rain the entire cruise). The captain of the ship worked his magic to move as close as possible to the Margerie Glacier at the end of Tarr Inlet (plus he manoeuvered the ship so that the port and starboard sides faced the glacier at different times), as well as spending long enough there for everyone to experience the sight. We were also privileged to see and hear parts of the glacier fall crashing into the water. It was a beautiful sight. Just how many photos can one take?!?!The sad aspect of the glaciers there is that the Margerie Glacier is the only one maintaining its size and depth. The others and particularly the Grand Pacific Glacier next door, is retreating at an accelerating rate.

(That's what those days "" at sea"" are for!). The sun wasn't shining, so we didn't get to see the mountains behind the glaciers. However, we got very close to Margerie Glacier and parked in front of it for about an hour. The glacier was calving several times.

Thankful for the opportunity to visit this beautiful place. We LOVED hearing the glaciers snap, crackle, pop, and watching them slide into the water.The water was a gorgeous blue color with lots of ice chunks floating around into it. The lines and colors in the glaciers were super pretty. You could really see a lot of the dirt, rocks, and items that the glaciers brought down through the mountains and valleys with it. It was a super fascinating experience! We took a lot off pictures, but even the pictures don't do it justice. We even saw several animals while on the boat going through Glacier Bay...a bear near a camp site with campers in a tent, otters swimming in the water, and more!We had the privilege of visiting Glacier Bay National Park on it's 100 anniversary!

The room has the modern conveniences of bathrooms, showers, electricity, heating, etc. but the rooms are quite 'rustic'. In fact I saw a historic 1950's - ish advertisement featuring a room and the room we stayed in looked exactly the same. I don't usually like quite so retro but this was our true American national park heritage combined with picture perfect location in Alaska's raw wild beauty. It just all worked perfectly together. Imagine waking up in the morning, strolling over to main lodge building for breakfast, then heading out for a day in nature - maybe hiking the trails or taking a fjord cruise. Then further imagine coming back afterwards to the main lodge for dinner followed by a park ranger presentation afterwards.

If you don't like something, just tell your waiter (nicely) and they will be happy to get you something else.The White Pass Railroad train was a great choice as we enjoyed fantastic weather. The west side of town over looking Skagway. This was a great spot to see the town of Skagway and the ships.Docked at Juneau and the plan was to take the MGT shuttle bus to Mendenhall Glacier and do a hike.In Ketchikan we went a shore and walked down to Creek Street. very nice town to do some shopping.Victoria Canada was amazing, wished we could of spend more time.Ok on to the entertainment and activities, there is something for everyone to do.As far as the Ship, it was in fine condition. If you are going to scour the ship looking for things that are wrong, then maybe you should be an inspector instead of a vacationer. I don't understand people who complain about a piece of rust or flaking paint on the wall or corner of your balcony. The ship gets used every day in all kinds of weather with moisture around all the time. This stuff will happen.

We had Alaska national park rangers come aboard the cruise ship at the start of the day, and they gave lectures and artifact demonstrations all day long so the passengers could alternate between these and looking at the glacier. Incredible, incredible experience. Worth the cost of the whole trip. Not only was I swept away by the beauty and grandeur of the huge blue ice wall in front of the ship, but by all the wildlife we saw both in the bay and entering and leaving it. I saw sea otters in floating kelp, orcas, seals, a humpback whale, mountain goats, and eagles. This was in the area of Muir Inlet, I believe. Just an incredible experience, all the way around. We also saw the glacier calve a little bit, and send floating chunks of ice into the bay.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We took the tour boat offered and attended/narrated by the Forest Service. For our first day in Alaska, we took the full day tour boat to Johns Hopkins and Marjorie Glacier. The glaciers were the end point, but the journey was exciting and beautiful. The Forest Rangers talked about the wildlife we would find along the tour and helped spot them. In one day we saw: Sea Lions, Tufted and Horned Puffins, Eagles, Otters, Orcas, one brown/grizzly bear and one black bear and a variety of other birds. Binoculars are provided on the trip, but close enough to see wild life without. If you take the tour, don't worry too much if you get a seat that is not near a window. You will be moving about the boat all day, with access to the back and top. While upstairs might seem like the obvious choice, I recommend a table seat on the lower floor. However, if stairs are a problem for you, take a seat on the second deck so you can move outside for a view without going up or down. The glaciers up close were also amazing. However a note on the calving. Don't get your hopes too high. For us, there were large chunks dropping in the water, but nothing really that dramatic even though the boat parked for about 30 minutes to allow enjoyment of the view. Go with the expectation to enjoy the beauty of the scenery. It is a rain forest, so consider that it might be cloudy and rainy on the day you go. This will, unfortunately, reduce the opportunity to see the amazing mountains, but you should still see sea life and glaciers. Per the rangers, the ""lucky"" parts of our trip were: sunny day, orcas in a group, spotting rare horned puffins, clear viewing of Mount Fairweather. ""Unlucky"" parts of the day were: no mountain goats sited, icebergs prevented close up access to Johns Hopkins glacier. We were also fortunate to be on a partially full trip (I'd say 50% capacity) due to our late-August timing (Aug 20)","September 5, 2016",Tour Boat was a Highlight of our Alaska trip!,69,,5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We stayed at the Glacier Bay Lodge for two nights after flying into Gustavus from Anchorage. We loved the lodge and the food in the dining room. The biggest highlight was the Park Service boat tour through Glacier Bay. What a marvelous trip that was. The capacity of the boat is 160 and we only had 40 that day with a park ranger and multiple boat hands all with binocs looking for and tracking wildlife. We saw multiple humpback whales, lots of sea otters, puffins, cormorants, kittywaikes, mountain goats, sea lions and bald eagles. The best sightings were 3 orcas swimming together and 5 grizzlies feeding at a creek or riverbed flowing into one of the small side bays. Our vessel was small enough that we could stop at each of the sightings and wait for the whales to reappear and get up close to the grizzlies and the sea lions. We were also quite close to the glaciers and had some calving views. This boat trip was a real highlight of our entire Alaskan adventure. Many thanks to the entire crew--they were great!!! Another wonderful thing to see at Glacier Bay is the new Tlingit tribal House that will be dedicated August 25 of this year. It was not open to the public during our visit but we happened to be hiking by and some of the native designers were there checking things out. They invited us in to take a look. The workmanship is breathtaking. What a special treat to see it. Obviously, we were enthralled with Glacier Bay.","August 22, 2016",A National Geographic moment in real life!,37,USA,5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"The summer marked our tenth 2-week vacation in Alaska, but our first trip to GBNP. It was long on our bucket list to get to, but it never seemed to work out with other places we wanted to see. Let's just say we were idiots for waiting so long!We love to hike, and while there are not dozens of trails to choose from, those that are there are really gorgeous. They are mostly flat, and mostly through old-growth temperate rain forests surrounding you in different shades of green as you walk. There is also almost unlimited beach to explore, but watch the tides for the best experience.The ""touristy"" Glacier Bay boat tour turned us off at first, as we have done many day cruises out of other ports in Alaska, and we figured we'd see nothing new. But, of course, this tour is the main reason why you go to GBNP, so we reconsidered - SO glad we did!First, the boat was less than half full, so decks were uncrowded, food was easy, and seating was plentiful. The day started ""iffy"", but improved as soon as we set sail, giving us some actual blue sky for a couple of hours.The captain was very skilled, the crew was great, and we saw tons of whales (mostly in the distance, as they are not allowed to ""chase"" whales). We did have one surface very close to the boat, which was awesome. Lots of sea lions, sea birds, sea otters... And then the wolf mother and her 2 pups on one of the many beaches! Incredible! We also saw another wolf on a different beach, and a grizzly bear on yet another beach. The glaciers were spectacular, with Marjorie calving quite a bit. A great day at sea, for sure!So, don't be like us and wait so long. Go to GBNP, and take the day cruise!!","August 22, 2016",Alaskan Bucket List,40,"Bartlett, Illinois",5

Went right to the end of Glacier Bay and could hear Margerie Glacier creak and groan as we took in the full width of the glacier.

Seeing a glacier actually calve into the bay can never be predicted. As was the case on this trip, we could hear the calving and the sound of the ice hitting the water, but it was happening around the point of the glacier such that it wasn't visible to us. Oh well, that's how it goes.So go for the views and be extra excited if you get to see the calving, too.

The weather , of course, is not the tour company's fault. However, I do feel they know when it is fogged in, what the rest of the trip will be like. I think on days such as our day, an option should be available to cancel. Obviously, this isn't the case. Thus for us we spent $400 to look at a glacier and ride in a boat.

While there are at least 10 cruise ships leaving every day from either Vancouver or Seattle in the summer, not all cruise include Glacier Bay in their itinerary. Usually for a cruise that visits Glacier Bay, there is whole day dedicated to this area. There is no port of call. The ship just cruises up and down the Bay. At some point, the ship sail very close the ""tongue"" of a glacier, so passengers can witness scenes of ice calves off the glacier and falls into the water. Considering how beautiful and majestic the scenery of Glacier Bay is, it is really worthwhile to come here, even though you don't get off the ships and can just view everything from abroad.So, when choosing an Alaskan cruise, do try to find one that pay a visit the Glacier Bay National Park.

Upon arrival to the Margerie Glacier, the cruise ship slowly spins around so everyone gets a great view of this magnificent glacier. Right next to it, is the Grand Pacific Glacier. It doesn't look like a glacier really since it is black and brown in color and is full of gravel, rocks and dirt. After spinning around for about an hour, we left and went on to see other glaciers within the Glacier Bay National Park. The next big one to look out for is the Lamplugh Glacier. This one has a brilliant blue cavern within the glacier and is incredible to see in person. From there, the next big one to see is the Johns Hopkins Glacier. You can't see this one up close because the big cruise ship can't make it in and out of the fjord. It's so big that even from a distance, it's incredible to see! You park there long enough to take it in and marvel at its size and beauty. Pull out your binoculars and take it all in. There are other glaciers you will encounter during your time in the Glacier Bay National Park and there are so many mountains, water falls and wildlife you can also enjoy during your visit. Hope for clear, calm weather during your trip so you can enjoy all of the sights this wonderful place has to offer.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We visited this National Park and Preserve via cruise ship, as do most visitors. Access is restricted daily to keep the area as pristine as possible and the big ships do a decent job of getting many people in and out without the need for disruptive infrastructure. While not the same as trekking on or near one of the glaciers, the views from the sea are breathtaking and one can get an idea of the immense size and contrasting fragility of the massive ice fields. The National Park Service Ranger did a terrific job of broadcasting shipwide about the geography and wildlife in the area as we passed through. His colleagues who brought aboard their Jr. Ranger program and provided instruction and pins for all participants were great with the kids. The NPS also provided a small supply of shirts and such for sale to commemorate our visit. We have visited Alaska many times and Glacier Bay is our favorite glacier viewing area.","July 16, 2016",Still beautiful,148,"Haslet, Texas",5

Beautiful sunny day on Independence Day. Marjorie glacier is everything you see in magazines (it's the most photographed glacier). Amazing to see the source of the glacier in the majestic mountains in the background. We saw seals, whales, and sea otters. No mountain goats, but those upland pastures sure are beautiful.","July 15, 2016","A peaceful, wonderous place.",240,"milwaukee, wisconsin",5

One tip: Take some time to just LOOK at the glaciers. So many people are obsessed with taking photos and, as a result, they miss out on the experience of just experiencing them. Additional note: We were on the Island Princess and took an excursion to land on a glacier via helicopter. Awesome!","July 15, 2016",Not sure what more I can say...,195,"Denville, New Jersey",5

OMG -- we saw the glacier calf approximately five times while we were watching. All around you are glaciers and the huge chunks of ice are floating all around the ship. We had a naturalist board the ship and she talked about the glaciers and gave great information pretty much of the day. The ice is so blue in some places and it’s so neat to see it calf! The ice looks blue when the light hits highly compacted ice and long wavelength colors (reds) are absorbed and short wavelength colors (blues) reflect back through the ice to your eyes. This was one of the most beautiful things I’ve seen and will never forget.","July 13, 2016",Glacier Bay: No Words,131,"Charlotte, North Carolina",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We were on the Star Princess recently on the Alaska Voyage of the Glaciers on the Inside Passage from Vancouver, and the trip to Glacier Bay inlet aboard the ship was the highlight of our cruise. We have been to the Hubbard glacier before, but we could not believe what we saw at Glacier Bay. There is no comparison, and the sights of the various glaciers with the occasional calving of the glaciers really displayed the grandeur and beauty of Glacier Bay. If you are planning an Alaska cruise, make sure that the itinerary includes Glacier Bay as well as College Fjord. If your itinerary does not include these two trips, you would have missed the opportunity of a lifetime to enjoy and marvel at these natural wonders. Make sure that you will be cruising along the Inside Passage from Vancouver or Seattle. Bring along a good supply of SD cards and well-charged batteries for your digital camera. Phone cameras are OK but to really get up close and personal, have a digital SLR. You'll never regret going on this cruise, and for sure you'll have a need to do it again in the future. A must for the adventurous traveller. Hopefully, you'll have a good sunny day when you cruise ship go into these glacier inlets. We had two glorious days (in fact 7 sunny Alaska cruise days - lucky for us). Go in June or July, these are the best times. Don't go during the cheap months of May or September cruises. This attraction is definitely an extremely recommended attraction.

Actively calving the roar of thunderous cracking precedes the actual crash of all sizes breaking off the main glacier. (by the way: Anyone who thinks global warming isn't true just needs to see the glacier pieces littering the passage... :-(We were able to witness its remarkable glimpses of marine and wild life - this Alaska's Inside Passage seemed an added bonus!(Orca pods and humpbacks, bald eagles, huge sea gulls, owls, plovers, goshawks, bald eagles, puffins, & more.)The Inside Passage ecosystems include Alpine/High Mountain/Forest/Marine!

It was a chilly, rainy, overcast day so we were somewhat disappointed. Repeatedly during our trip we were told that this type of day proves best for photos and for wildlife to emerge. Attending this talk is valuable, maps and literature are also available. There were three rangers aboard our ship for this experience. One of the rangers spoke in the morning to outline our day and what time we were arriving/spending at each glacier. They also told us what to look for and what to listen for. Our captain also had a bit of advice as he made announcements on the ship's PA system....""Most of you will spend one day of your life at Glacier Bay, make the most of it."" He was right, despite the rain and the cold, we spend most of the day outside on the bow of the ship.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"There are experiences one will never forget--this is one of them. Our Holland America Line cruise ship brought us into Glacier Bay--an entire day adventure. The scenery was beautiful from the get-go; then we approached the Johns Hopkins Inlet and Glacier, wow. We had seen other glaciers, but this one was so large! We thought the trip had reached the climax. . . but, no! Around the next corner, into the Tarr Inlet we approached the Margerie Glacier--there it was, the unforgettable experience! The glacier is huge, I think the face is over 200 feet (taller than our ship). We were hoping to see part of the face fall off into the ocean and we were not disappointed--small trickles of snow and ice would fall, then a little more, then huge chunks would crash into the water. The sight of it, the sound of it, the awesomeness of the entire experience is hard to describe and very moving--it's almost spiritual! We witnessed this three or four times on this one glacier--and the only evidence left was the broken off icebergs floating in the water. Our weather was perfect on the day we visited; Alaska's coast is often rainy and cold; we had calm seas and sunny skies--perfect! And if that wasn't enough, on our way out of the Park we were entertained by whales! One whale in particular gave us quite the show--again, an unforgettable experience.","June 27, 2016",Unforgettable!,17,"Grand Marais, Minnesota",5

Surrounded on all sides by views so primeval, majestic and overwhelming, I had to stop and praise God, who created such breathtaking beauty! I thanked Him for the opportunity to witness this frozen wonderland first-hand, as no photograph can ever capture the scale and grandeur of this experience. I appreciated the fact that ours was the only cruise ship there, dwarfed by the behemoth walls of ice. Climate change was a discernible reality--up to 250 years ago, there was apparently no bay, only a huge glacier covering the valley, all the way into the Icy Strait. We were thrilled to see and heal glaciers calving icebergs (chunks of ice that break off glaciers and fall into the water)—that was pretty amazing.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Glacier Bay was awesome from the time we went out for cocoa and a walk on our ship, to the time we ended our day. We saw several glaciers, and had plenty of time to see them and photograph them. There wasn’t much calving, but they were beautiful nonetheless. There were of course the beautiful mountains, the shining jade colored water, and the strange shaped ice chunks in the water. We saw sea lions and otters and about a bazillion birds. The naturalist pointed out 2 bears on the shore, but I was not able to locate them. Someone reported they saw a whale on the side of the ship that we were not on. We went to the following glaciers in Glacier Bay, plus we could see others as we went along, both tidewater and hanging glaciers: o Margerie Glaciero Grand Pacific Glaciero Lamplugh Glaciero Reid Glaciero Johns Hopkins Glaciero Topeka GlacierWe were able to go closer to Lamplugh and Johns Hopkins than we’d been before because when we’ve been there before, the seals were having their babies (“pupping” they call it). The Johns Hopkins Inlet beyond the bend is a protected preserve for the seals and you can’t pass that bend. We were able to go a little further in. I was able to get good pictures of all the glaciers. We stayed at Margerie and Lamplugh for quite a long time, with the ship rotating around several times at each. They also rotated the ship around at John Hopkins, so we had plenty of time to view it. The weather all day was cool but pleasant and sunny. I didn’t have to wear as much cold weather gear as I expected and didn’t use the hand-warmers I'd packed in my camera bag. We spent most of the Glacier Bay day out on the deck above the swimming pool on our ship. The viewing going out of the bay back to the sea was beautiful as well and we very much enjoyed our day.","May 30, 2016",Excellent tour of the glaciers in Glacier Bay!,151,"West Valley City, Utah",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Stark, isolated and crystalline, the cluster of glaciers found in Glacier Bay National Park are stunning. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and a highlight of the Inside Passage, this 25-million acre remnant of the last ice age puts tourists in their place. It's primordial and impersonally beautiful, though one's individual reaction to it might be very personal. I was gobsmacked the whole time. The hours our ship spent in the park flew by, and our tour was over in the blink of an eye. Put this on your bucket list.","May 29, 2016","Perilous, primordial beauty",65,"Vancouver, Canada",5

A team of Park Service rangers came aboard to provide narration and personal discussions. We were up close with several glaciers and had a lot of time to admire their huge scale, over 200 feet high. Take your winter parka, even in early May it was very cold out on deck. The usually off limits bow deck was open for passengers to get a better view.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"After a very very long day of travel to get from Iowa to Alaska, stepped off the plane to see one of the most beautiful parts of this awesome country. We stayed in one of the cabins run by the national park. If you want to take yourself off the grid this is the place. A week of no phones, no internet, no tv's, no radio. The first time I have ever been this far away from civilization. We visited in July, the weather was beautiful, it rains a lot up there, but not the kind of rain I'm use to, more of a delightful mist. With the rainfall they have, you can imagine, the beautiful color of green everything is. Nature trails that run around the lodge are very nice and well kept. Have a few for every level of hiking you want to do. The lodge is in the middle of acres and acres of wilderness, so it is the source of food and drink for the most part. First time i have been to a lodge like this thats restaurant prepares 4 Star meals, not camping food. Food is delicious, but it comes with a cost. For a break one day, the wife and I rode into town on the park bus, and visited a few local stores and the restaurant in town, I say a few, as a few is all that is there. Don't think your going to stop by the SuperSaver or Safeway and pick up a cart full of groceries, that isn't happening in this town. We also rented kayak's and did the boat trip to watch whales and see the glaciers, I will review those for the companies that we used, but both the lodge set up for us, very quick and painless. Make sure to have lots of film or memory cards, when I returned home, i couldn't even fit all of the photos onto a DVD, if your like me, you will take hundreds of photos of this hidden away beautiful place. The only real complaint was the limited menu at the lodge. About 5 things to choose from on the menu, and it didn't change the entire week. If you are not a fish eater, plan on eating the same thing numerous times, but if you enjoy halibut, its worthy of eating almost everyday. They have local beer and a full bar, which I loved, but last call comes early, so stock up.","January 14, 2016",Very beautiful place,19,"Council Bluffs, Iowa",5

The day was cold and blustery with rain, but still they are magnificent and still close at hand. Some day they will be no more; in the 1600s this was a grassy valley. Glaciers have retreated 65 miles from their maximum distance in 1750. Photographers: I do not recommend a tripod due to vibrations from ship engines. Go with a zoom lens or two and have image stabilzation. Adopt photographing with a good body posture and leg positioning. Check to see which white balance works best according to the conditions.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve is a United States national park and preserve in the Alaska panhandle west of Juneau. Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve occupies the northernmost section of the southeastern Alaska coastline, between the Gulf of Alaska and Canada. Our cruise ship arrived early morning and we ordered breakfast in our balcony cabin to enjoy the crisp air and majestic view of the glaciers in Glacier Bay NP. The first stop was the Margerie Glacier which is an integral to the history of Glacier Bay.It was disheartening to know, witness and hear the calving of the glaciers into the bay cause by global warming. The Princess cruise slowed down and took the Park Rangers aboard upon entering the Glacier and naturalist to narrate and explain facts about the Glacier BayNo roads lead to the park and it is most easily reached by air travel. During some summers there are ferries to the small community of Gustavus or directly to the marina at Bartlett Cove. Despite the lack of roads there are over 400,000 visitors each year most of whom arrive via cruise ship. The number of ships that may arrive each day is limited by regulation.","October 30, 2015",Majestic Glacier Bay National Park in Alaska,61,"Atlanta, Georgia",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We visited Glacier bay on our Alaska cruise, with Norwegian cruise lines in late September. While it rained to and from Glacier bay while we were in the bay's the sun came out and it was spectacular to say the least. The ship came as close to the glacier as possible and slowly turned around three times so we all could get a great view no matter what part of the ship we were on. There were Sea otters playing around the ship and napping on the ice flows along with hundreds of seals. the glacier calved once in a great showering of ice and water. We saw bears, Goats, eagles along the shore. The mountains shone with a mantle of pure white snow and water falls tinkled into the sea every where we looked. Fantastic, just fantastic.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Glacier Bay was a stop on our cruise and we had heard that it was a must for first time Alaskan cruisers and we were not disappointed! I assume it works this way for most large-ship cruises: a team of park rangers boarded the ship in the morning as we entered the mouth of Glacier Bay. A team set up in one of the upper deck bars with info and to answer any questions while one ranger gave a presentation throughout much of the day. We sailed past beautiful scenery and some wildlife (mostly birds and sea otters) and up to the Margerie and Grand Pacific Glaciers. The ship rotated on the spot for the better part of an hour so everyone could get a good view. The Marjorie is pretty and blue and clean white while the Grand Pacific has carried more dirt with it and looks black. I didn't realize at the time that that was pretty much the Canadian border right there. After a while, we sailed back and hung out at the Lamplugh Glacier. Afterwards, one of the rangers gave a great presentation in the theater about the park and the role they play in it. As we left the bay in the afternoon, they got back on their little boat! I can't imagine boarding a huge cruise ship from a small boat like that. Overall, it was great fun just to hang out on deck for most of the day with everyone on board, I met a lot of people I hadn't met yet and had great conversations. They had warm stews on deck if people didn't want to go inside to eat and a fru-fru coffee service to warm folks up. It was a little chilly--I definitely needed a jacket and a hat, but it wasn't bad at all. I wished the glaciers would have calved more dramatically--we only got a couple of pops here and there of the ""white thunder"" that echos around the bay, but I heard it at least once! It would definitely be fun to explore more in a smaller boat and get even closer, but even on a big cruise ship, we felt like we were right there.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve," All I can say is that we have been fortunate to have gone on an Alaskan Boat twice in three years and going into Glacier Bay and experiencing it in person was one reason why we went on that second Alaskan Boat Cruise in as many years. Going through Glacier Bay on your Cruise Ship and being able to see it from the balcony on your room is like something out of a Fairy Tale and makes you feel all numb inside. It was simply breathtaking and beautiful to see the beauty of Glacier Bay and since we were aboard the Holland America Line, we were fortunate to go all the way inside Glacier Bay because only a select few of Cruise Ships are allowed to do that. The highlight of coming here was seeing thug chunks of ice falling into the ocean with a big crashing sound. It was extremely loud and cool to watch from the Cruise Ship.

We were on an Norwegian Cruise Line tour and fortunately were late enough into the season that we were able to get close to the John Hopkins' glacier.

Then we cruised back out and saw the Margaret Glacier and the Grand Pacific Glacier behind Margaret. On the way, I spotted a Glacier bear with my binoculars which was awesome.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"In May we took our first cruise to Alaska. Having lived in BC for may years we never gave it much thought as we have seem a lot of mountains, water ways, and ice. The opportunity was there as we are Latitude member of NCL Cruise line and had a credit to use and felt lets just do this. We made our way to Vancouver one day prior to the cruise so as to not be rushed to make it to the ship. As we sailed up the inside passage we found it relaxing, entertaining and no lack of sites to take in. There is much to talk about regarding ports of call wild life both in the sea and air but this is more about one of those OH moments.Our ship cruised up the channel into Glacier Bay on board was a park Ranger who was giving audio of the site and history of the location. The captain brought the ship to a halt close to the Glacier and proceeded to use the side engines to turn the ship 360 degrees so as to allow all on board to take in the sites regardless of your location. To here the crack of the ice an see chunks crash into the ocean is breathtaking.This is one of these locations you can only get to by boat and to miss this is to miss out on one of those OH moments. everyone should make the effort once in there life to see this while they can because as we know nothing is for ever.","September 30, 2015",As Seen from a Cruise Ship,46,"Victoria, Canada",5

Their sizes are hard to believe both in height and distance. The varying colours are beautiful. Could see many different shades of blue. We saw and did we hear, the carving of the ice. Once again, amazing. We had a ranger and a member of the Tlingit tribe board the ship and give some very informative information. We got to see Reid, Lamplugh, Margerie, Grand Pacific (doesnt look the same as the others) and John Hopkins glaciers.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"This was part of the cruise itinerary and it was pretty cool. After departing Skagway you hang a right and go up into Glacier Bay National Park and Wilderness. There has been some friction with the Greenies that cruise ship traffic might be causing environmental harm. An agreement has been reached whereby only 2 ships/day can go into the park. This is good because it’s a fairly impressive sight. The ship enters the bay and passes by a couple “smaller” glaciers to park right in front of the Margerie Glacier. Our ship faced one side of the boat to the glacier for 30 minutes and then spun the boat around so the other side could view for 30 minutes. We had a balcony room and simply sat there to take in the sights. After 30 minutes we decided to get lunch on the Lido. Everyone was on one side of the ship, watching the glacier so we sat on the opposite side….then the boat turned 180 degrees and we had a perfect view for lunch. I recommend you do the same thing. If you’re lucky you’ll catch the glacier “calving,” dropping huge chunks of ice into the water. You won’t get to see this in too many places so avail yourself of the opportunity.","September 29, 2015","Apparently, Size Matters",260,"Kingsport, Tennessee",5

There were national park rangers who were on the Pearl while we sailed through Glacier Bay. They did a very good job of telling us about the area. Once we had sailed through one of the rangers gave us a very nice presentation on Glacier Bay History and also how she came to Glacier Bay and has now lived there for ten years.

When the glacier calved it was like a thunderclap echoing around us.The ship rotated one and a half times to allow everyone on board the chance to experience the sheer majesty of the whole area before heading away.

Because we were on the Coral Princess's last southbound inside passage for the season (second week in September) we were past the seal breeding season and were permitted to cruise closer to the John Hopkins glacier than is generally allowed during other times of the year.

On our prior visit they were all but joined at the water's edge. Today the Grand Pacific is mostly mud at the bay's edge and the Margerie has retreated but we still saw small pieces calf into the bay. Getting to this point, where we stayed for some time, was a distance of about 65 miles from the entrance to the bay at Bartlett Cove.Even from the deck of a big ship, it was a great experience to share with our grandkids.","September 16, 2015",Awesome but Sad to See Retreating Glaciers,156,"Palm Beach, Florida",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We saw Glacier Bay National Park from our cruise ship, the Grand Princess, and the views were amazing.The glaciers could be heard cracking, and occasionally letting out thunder or gunshot like noises as the ice fractured. Several times, in various size chunks, the glaciers calved and new icebergs fell into the water.The scenery around the bay was beautiful. The icebergs, though very small compared with the size of the ship, were pretty good sized chunks of ice and some of their size below water level could be seen as we passed close to them.I'd been here 16 years ago on another cruise and the weather that day was dreadful--a cold light rain was falling and it was windy and unpleasant to be outside, and the mist obscured the mountains. But I thought it was great even in lousy weather. This time, the weather was superb--sunny and warm, and I enjoyed it even more. I'm told that you are more likely to encounter cool and misty weather than sunny, but from experience I can tell you that the glaciers are impressive in any weather.","September 15, 2015",Impressive and beautiful,610,"DeWitt, New York",5

The sun was shinning and as the fog lifted we were in total amazement with the views. Binoculars and the naked eye does not do the majestic size of the mountains and scenes. When you spot a mountain goat the size of your pinky finger is when you realize how big this place is! Orcas were swimming alongside the ship. We saw otters floating on the backs basking in the sun. The rangers that had embarked provided a continuous narration of the area. The piece de resistance is at the end....the majestic Margerie Glacier...omg I am so happy to have lived to see this.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Weather will definitely play a large factor in determining how much you will enjoy Glacier Bay. I was very fortunate that it was completely sunny for our cruise day. Not only did that make it not as cold to be outside, but it made the colors of the water and the mountains more spectacular. Even if it is cloudy, I think the bay would probably still be beautiful. I understand that the blue color reflected from the glacier ice is more intense when there is not full sun. And obviously, if it raining, you will likely not have good views.We cruised through the bay for about 9 hours on a Princess ship. It was a treat to finally see the long-anticipated Margerie Glacier. The adjacent Grand Pacific Glacier, having greatly receded, is not as attractive, but it is impressive to consider that it is mostly responsible for the creation of the bay. We were lucky to view several calvings of Margerie. We also saw several of the other major glaciers in the bay, including Lamplugh, Johns Hopkins, and Reid. As far as wildlife, we saw a number of bald eagles (and many other birds) just perched on top of small icebergs as we went by. There were several sea lions swimming in the bay water.Having Park Rangers on board during the bay cruise to give commentary was very helpful, although it wasn't always possible to hear them, depending on where you happened to be.","September 10, 2015",Beautiful day of cruising,214,New Jersey,5

The park ranger Zac was enthusiastic and knowledgeable and made for an informative trip. The captain was on the look out constantly for wildlife and would slow down and let us know if she saw anything. binos are provided for every seat. lunch of subs and soup is also provided as well as complimentary coffee, tea and hot choc.

My wife and I spent 8 hours on the Promenade Deck just observing the glaciers and other scenery. Margerie glacier is very spectacular. It is 21 miles long and moves forward six to eight feet a day. This causes a lot of calving at the terminus which is a mile wide and 250 feet tall. Even if one was blind it would be amazing listening to the ""White Thunder"" which is what the natives call the rumble that occurs as the ice splits and calves. I addition to the mountains and glaciers we also enjoyed a humpback whale breaching and slamming the water with its flippers and tail.","September 9, 2015",Absolutely stunning!,63,"Sulphur, Louisiana",5

It definitely lived up to its billing. The ship stayed at Marjorie Glacier for almost an hour and got much closer than I expected. The smaller tour boats didn’t get much of a better view. Although there was no calving while we were there, we did hear a calving on the way in. On the return trip, we visited another glacier and although three miles away, it seemed much closer. Saw a lot of harbor seals. Rangers were on board the ship and provided occasional commentary and also had a table set up.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Glacier Bay National Park Contains Huge Glaciers and is a product of the Little Ice Age. Some of the glaciers located within glacier bay are retreating while others are still advancing. West of Juneau, Alaska, the park and reserve are reached by boat or plane only. Glacier Bay has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is comprised of 3.3 million acres of mountains, glaciers, forests, and waterways. It is the highlight of Alaska's Inside Passage! Glaciers fed by heavy snow extend to the sea and calve icebergs from their face. Sediments accumulate at the face of the tidewater glacier providing a protective shoal from the seawater, allowing the ice to advance into deeper water. Under ideal conditions (Low Sunlight ) the glaciers appear as a brilliant turquoise blue color. The reason is that all colors are absorbed with the exception of this beautiful blue turquoise color. I viewed these glaciers from a cruise ship and captured the calving of truck sized icebergs into the sea. The sound that is emitted during this process is similar to a loud sonic boom that echoes throughout the mountaintops and the valley below. The reason is that they are under thousands of pounds of pressure and are hundreds of years old. Icebergs in the waterways can be from small to quite large. The glaciers can extend upwards at around 600 feet and there is twice that height under the water. Al glaciers travel down the mountains they carry with them sold from the mountains, valleys and fjords that they carve out as they advance. Depending on the minerals in the silt from the rock that they literally pulverize it can actually change the color of the water. Some water may be blue, some brown, some an emerald green.Glacier Bay National Park is an awesome sight that is rich in wildlife. It is truly a wonder to behold.

The captain was great and had a good eye for wildlife, and there was a knowledgeable park ranger on board who gave talks, explained some of the wildlife and scenery, and answered questions. The boat went very close to Margerie Glacier, close enough to hear the icebergs breaking off into the inlet.The Park also has some hiking trails, but unfortunately did not get a chance to hike them.

Comfortable seating, on our trip it was not crowded so there was plenty of room to move about. There are a couple of electrical outlets on the main deck for keeping your camera and devices charged. There are plenty of binoculars for your use. Complimentary coffee, tea, hot chocolate, juices; different snacks to purchase. Our Park Service narrator, Ranger Jenny, was excellent : enthusiastic, informative and engaging especially with the children. The boat staff were all friendly and helpful. The inside of the boat is sufficiently warm but you will want to go on the outside decks which can be windy and cold. Mid-morning we were served delicious cups of salmon chowder and at lunch time there were substantial sandwiches, chips, fruit, cookies all included in your fare.You will spend some time at Marble Island, to see sea lions and sea birds up close. Further into the bay the crew will be on the lookout for harbor seals, grizzlies and mountain goats on the shoreline (we saw each). On this trip they went as close as they could to the Johns Hopkins glacier and spent quite a long time there watching for calving. Don’t be discouraged if you spend the first part of the trip in bad weather. By the time we got to where you wanted to see glaciated mountain peaks, the sun was coming out and it was brilliantly sunny at the destination.","August 20, 2015",Wonderful Day,53,Louisville,5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We wanted at least two days at Glacier Bay National Park to experience close up views of the big glaciers and wildlife. The best way to do it is to stay at the Lodge at the Park and take their all day, 'small' boat tour. That boat tour was a highlight of our trip to SE Alaska. We saw whales, a female Brown Bear and her three cubs, Sea Lions, Sea Otters, Harbor Seals, numerous kinds of birds and learned a lot about the cycle of glaciers and the land they cover. We stayed at the lodge at the Park for two nights. About 25 cabins grouped around the lodge that offer plain but comfortable accommodations. Meals in the restaurant were from average to good. Park Rangers have great displays in the lodge and on the trails around the lodge and conduct small group tours that better explain the ecology of the area and the native peoples. You can do unguided hiking on a number of trails around the Lodge as well.If you are adventurous kayaking and kayak camping is offered. The the Park Boat, for a fee, will drop you at remote areas of Glacier Bay so you can do kayak camping and they will pick you up at pre-arranged times.. The Park was not overcrowded despite our August visit timing. Alaska Air offers flights from Juneau--12 air minutes away to an airport at Gustavus which is right on the edge of the park. Local airlines in Juneau also offer flights to the Park. The airport is a bit of history too. It was built during World War II as part of a chain of airports to ferry military air traffic along the West Coast including into the Arctic. Planes stopped there to refuel and for maintenance and repair if needed. After the War civilian airlines used it for the same purpose. The airport at Gustavus makes it easy to access one of the most remote national parks in the USA.Cab or Van service is available from airport to Park Lodge. No cell phone reception at the Park so no one walking around talking or texting which was nice for a change. Prices for everything are higher in Alaska and more so at remote areas like Glacier Bay so plan accordingly.","August 20, 2015",Glacier Bay National Park is Great.

It's nature at it's best.","August 20, 2015",NATURE AT ITS BEST,63,"Madison, Wisconsin",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,We took a cruise which included Glacier Bay. The park rangers boarded our ship as we entered and provided narration throughout our journey. We spend about 8 hours cruising the area and the experience was incredible. The hilight is Margerie Glacier which is saved for the end and when you see it you will know why - spectacular!

Along the way, we watched a small craft approach our slow-moving ship, and several people were transferred on board. Did I say we were moving? After the presentation, we watched them disembark the same way. The day includes well-done commentary by the ship's crew as well as the Ranger and a rep from Alaska Geographic.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,Our trip to Glacier Bay National Park was aboard the Noordam as part of a Holland America tour. We were able to get quite close for a large ship and remained there for about 2 hours. It is incredible to see the blue ice that occurs when snow that falls on a glacier is compressed so tightly that air bubbles are squeezed out and the ice crystals enlarge and the ice appear blue. We were treated to seeing the Margerie Glacier calve several times and hear the thunderous ice chunks fall in the water.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"I visited Glacier Bay on a cruise ship. The Bay was almost an entire day of our itinerary and it was just beautiful. Our captain took us right close up to a few glaciers - Reid, Marjorie and Johns Hopkins, to name a few - much closer than I ever thought I'd be to a glacier in my life! We didn't see wildlife (I spotted the end of a whale's tail and its spout but it was so quick, I'm not sure it counts) but the glaciers more than adequately made up for that. Two rangers came on board and spent the day talking us through the Park over the PA system. They gave us a lot of great information and also did a presentation, which inspired me to go buy ""Travels in Alaska"" by John Muir (great book!).

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary in July 2015 with a six-day tour of Glacier Bay, Alaska, on the Sea Wolf, based out of Gustavus, Alaska. Our boat, a restored mine sweeper first placed in service in the San Francisco Bay area during World War II, has been wonderfully rebuilt to accommodate twelve passengers, with a crew of five. For our trip, we had a sixth crew member, a native of Gustavus and long-time commercial fisherman, who was on her inaugural run as an initiate naturalist. Hans Bruning, the senior naturalist, has more than 20 years of experience, and was outstanding as a guide and a keen observer of the ever-changing conditions present in the park. He was aided by Beth Martin, whose knowledge of the many branches and tidal idiosyncrasies of Glacier Bay proved valuable time and again throughout the trip. And although the initiate naturalist, Jess Soder, was experiencing the trip for the first time, it was clear from her familiarity with both the local flora and fauna that she had an impressive depth of understanding about the bay's ecosystems. With their collective help, we saw humpbacks and orcas, stellar sea lions, harbor seals and porpoises, oystercatchers, belted kingfishers, bald eagles, pigeon guillemots, common loons, ravens, tufted puffins, blacklegged kittiwakes, pelagic cormorants, mountain goats, brown bears (and their cubs), sea otters, pink salmon, sea stars, sea urchins, sea anemones, tidepool sculpin, and Baltic macoma. Many of these we saw close at hand while exploring branches of the bay in two-person kayaks - including an encounter with a bear and two cubs during a trip just outside the park, at Mud Bay in Icy Strait. These sightings were possible only because of the skill each of our naturalists brought to the excursion. They knew the tides, the vegetation, the signs of rough weather, and the conditions of the glaciers within the park. Equally important, they knew and followed the Park's rules regarding maintaining appropriate distances from wildlife. The naturalists made it possible for us to observe, without disturbing the surroundings, baby seals nesting near the face of Johns Hopkins Glacier; they brought us in kayaks to within half a mile of Margerie Glacier, where we floated for half an hour watching and filming remarkable calving that sent tons of ice into the water; they brought us by kayak and by skiff to bear trails on sundry small islands, teaching us how to be alert for signs of wildlife (including bear, moose, and wolf), and made sure we left no trace when we made our way back to the Sea Wolf. Once back on board, the ship's chef, Tom De Bari made sure we were well fed. Tom has spent years as a chef and restauranteur (most recently as owner of Milano's in Glacier, WA), and provided real sustenance at every meal - think whole wheat blueberry pancakes, fresh home made bagels and lox, broccoli omelettes for breakfast; hearty soups and salads for lunch; and outstanding seafood - including king crab, black cod, salmon, and halibut for dinner. While we were not able to meet the ship's owner and captain, Kimber Owens, she leftus and the Sea Wolf in good hands, with Craig Cambell serving as its captain for our trip. Craig has decades of experience as a mariner, and knew how to get the most out of every day, mindful of the changes in tide and weather that can make all the difference when venturing close into the bays and inlets that make up Glacier Bay Park. Each day we spent half the day exploring by kayak and the other half hiking or touring from the boat's deck. By the first day's anchor at North Sandy, we had passed through the Beardslee Islands, witnessing dozens of whales working their way up the coast, flukes raising and splashing, spray being blown out in great plumes. The second day we paddled around Point McLeod and hiked near the McBride Glacier. Before anchoring for the night of the third day we had toured the face of Muir Glacier, kayaked in Hunter Cove, explored both Tarr Inlet and Johns Hopkins (where we encountered hundreds of well-protected baby seals), and witnessed repeated explosive calvings at Margerie Glacier. When fog rolled in making a landing at Gloomy Knob impractical, Craig (consulting with the three naturalists) changed course and brought us to Blue Mouse, where we could safely kayak around the islands, hiking across Willoughby Island and touring Fingers Bay. When weather again threatened views, we changed plans and spent the day in Icy Strait, where we launched our kayaks into Mud Bay and watched as an adult bear and two cubs made their way along the banks of a creek not more than 100 yards away. Clearly the trip is not for everyone. It can be hard work handling a kayak in two-foot chop. One foray measured in at more than five miles, which is a lot of water to cover in a kayak. Still, neither my wife nor I had prior kayaking experience, and we we able to participate in each day's kayaking. Anyone who wanted to sit an activity out was welcome to do so (and several passengers did so, without complaint). In one case, while most of the passengers were set to embark on a hike around Willoughby Island, some elected to remain behind and watch a small pod of whales nearby. Seeing the interest in doing so, Craig accommodated that group by putting them aboard the boat's skiff and motoring out closer to the pod while the rest of us hiked. The accommodations, too, were outstanding. My wife and I had one of three cabins that have been retrofitted to permit use by persons with disabilities. The twin beds were well-made, the en suite toilet and shower worked very well, and our nights were quiet from 10 p.m. til 6:30 a.m., when the boat's generator resumed its service. Each night ended with gatherings that included wine and beer, appetizers, and the previously described meals, followed by wonderful desserts. While the excursion wasnot the least expensive of those entering Glacier Bay, it was likely the most customized and best curated trip around. Much of the credit for this should probably go to the Sea Wolf's owner, Kimber Owen. What likely makes this the best value is the cohesion of the crew: these people really know Glacier Bay, and have the ability to customize the trip to make the most of each day. We saw the large cruise vessels poke their noses in the general direction of some of the Bay's treasures. But at no time did any of us wish we were anywhere but with the crew of the Sea Wolf.","August 9, 2015","A diversity of wildlife like few other places on Earth, guided by outstanding naturalists",78,,5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"After spending many, many months researching what locations to visit in Alaska for our family with teens, we decided that the Glacier Bay National Park should be a must see!!! We were independent travelers. Such unbelievable beauty is seen here with more wildlife than we saw anywhere else on our entire visit. Some things we learned were that you can not get there by any other means by boat, ferry, or air. No cars can travel to the park, which may be a bit more difficult in making your travel plans, but part of the adventure! Our choice was to fly there, and we arrived at the Gustavus, a small town located about 65 miles northwest of Juneau. The airport is about 11 miles from the park. The only place you can stay INSIDE the park is the Glacier Bay Lodge, which we did do. Complimentary shuttle is given by the lodge and they picked us with prior contact to them right on time meeting the plane. We went on another boat tour to Tracy Arms Fjord, WHICH WAS GREAT, but this was a whole different experience. We wondered if it would be repetitive and not worth the full day boat tour departing at 7:30am and arriving back at the lodge at 3:30pm with a sandwich lunch included. We saw bears, tons of whales, moose, eagles, and sooooo many more wildlfie, and the most amazing in the temperate rain forest. Mountain goats were spectacular to see!!! They have black horns which distinguish them from the Dall sheep which live inland Alaska. The weather was in the 50's, but with just a few layers and light jacket, we were set. There are trails our family hiked around the lake and sea kayaking and also river rafting available. You can actually get to the park with just an overnight stay, take the tour, and then leave after the park if you are short on time. We chose to stay another night and relax in the gorgeous park setting!!!! Wonderful, wonderful part of our great Alaska experience!!!!","July 20, 2015",Great Alaska Experience,84,United States,5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"From the decks of the Princess Cruise ship, on a day that was sunny when we needed it to be, we watched our progress in and out of Glacier Bay. Park rangers boated up to the ship early in the morning and boarded by climbing a ladder on the side of the boat (!). We attended an early briefing which was very informative and then proceeded to listen to ranger commentary as the ship moved closer to the glaciers. What marvelous scenery. We felt that we had been transported back to an ice age world. We first saw the Lamplugh Glacier and then traveled to the Margerie and Grand Pacific Glaciers. We spent ample time viewing the glaciers, getting great photos, and even experiencing calving. It was all thrilling! When we travelled back toward the ranger station the rangers disembarked the same way they arrived. As they left the ship's horn saluted them. Have to say that I felt sad to see them go. They added to a spectacular experience.","July 19, 2015",Unbelievable beauty!,146,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We a family group of eight including two grandchildren were on an Alaskan cruise to the Glacier Bay National Park on board the cruise ship Norwegian Pearl from 28th June to 5th July, 2015, round-trip from Seattle. On July 2, 2015 from 6am to 3pm, we cruised the Glacier Bay National Park. As our cruise ship entered Glacier Bay via the Icy Strait & Point Gustavas, the US Park Rangers came on board and throughout our Glacier Bay sojourn, via the ship's public address system, kept us informed about the various landmark features & wildlife including islands, mountains, waterfalls, whales and Glaciers. Once we reached the Tarr Inlet, the inner most point of Glacier Bay, the majestic & stunningly beautiful Margerie Glacier came into view - from our vantage point on deck-13 was an awesome sight - the mighty mile-wide Glacier face with shimmering 'blue-ice' standing tall in front in all its glory. As we looked at the shimmering 'blue-ice' glacier-face in amazement & awe, there was a loud 'thunder-clap' and a part of the Glacier-face collapsed - we had witnessed Glacier Calving! And, that is how Icebergs are formed. Just adjacent to the Marjerie Glacier, on the right-side as you face it, is the Grand Pacific Glacier - totally bereft of an ice-cap! A firsthand example and testimony to the effects of ""Global Warming"". At this position our cruise-ship was being revolved on its axis - thus providing a 360 degree upclose view for all, irrespective of location around the ship. After this the cruise-ship sailed into the Johns Hopkins Inlet, past the Lamplugh Glacier, for a view of the Johns Hopkins Glacier. Here again the cruise-ship was positioned to give us an upclose view of the grandeur of both the Johns Hopkins and Lamplugh Glaciers. The visit to Glacier bay left all of us awestruck - beautiful nature in view in all its glory - a Must visit at least once in a Lifetime.","July 10, 2015",Glacier Bay - Awesome - a Must Visit atleast Once in a Lifetime,567,"Flagler Beach, Florida",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We were on a Norwegian cruise ship - the Pearl. We pulled into the bay and it was unlike anything we had seen. Glaciers surround you and mesmerize you as the ship sits stationary while slowly revolving on its axis - not a bad seat in the house. The main glacier is stunningly blue and beautiful. The mountains, namely the Fairweather Range, rise more than 15,320 feet - that is taller than Mount Rainier in Washington State. The temperature when we were there was cold but very tolerable. From our ship, or any tour ship, you get an upclose and personal view of the face of the glacier. The thing is constantly moving and slowly drops chunks of ice into the bay. We saw a piece come loose and fall, which was a really neat thing to see. We were lucky to have very little fog and no rain, so the view was spectacular. If you have a chance to go - do it. It is one of those things that you simply have to witness in person to appreciate the grandeur.","July 9, 2015",Surreal,208,Arizona,5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We took the eight hour boat tour along with perhaps 75 others on the Glacier Bay Boat Tour offered through the GB Lodge. There was plenty of room to sit both upstairs and down and to walk around outside. Binoculars were available for catching glimpses of sea creatures, birds, and wildlife. Our national park ranger, Masaki, provided excellent information about what we were seeing, history of the glaciers, and identification of the wildlife and marine life as they appeared, but he did not talk constantly, instead giving us the opportunity to observe and enjoy the spectacular scenery. The captain was good about pointing out things in the distance like a whale breaching or a bear running along the side of the bay. The boat spent about thirty minutes at two glaciers, the Grand Pacific and Margerie glacier. Grand Pacific, located at the head of the bay, has retreated from the bay itself but is the largest of those visible from the bay with most of its size extending northwest into Canada. Margerie is a tidewater glacier, one that actually terminates in the bay. As the ice reaches the sea, pieces break off, or calve, forming icebergs. As we waited at the foot of the Margerie everyone hoped to see it calve but it did not happen on our watch. Never-the-less, the trip was worth the time and expense for the close-up sights that Glacier Bay has to offer. A few hours into the trip, the crew brought around cups of seafood chowder for a mid-morning snack. Lunch consisted of sandwiches(hummus with cheese for us vegetarians!), chips, and drinks. Later that afternoon, homemade cookies were passed around. The crew was friendly and helpful and seemed genuinely interested in making sure that all aboard enjoyed themselves.","July 9, 2015",Amazing and convenient way to see the Bay,374,"Central, South Carolina",5

There are marine mammals as you enter and exit the Bay (seals, sea lions, otters, and if you're lucky, whales and orca), and bald eagles or other birds as you approach the glaciers. We were fortunate enough to be there on a very bright, warm, clear day that made for multiple glacier ""calving"" opportunities. This made the whole cruise for me!

From Bartlett Cove up the Western arm, and then up the Eastern arm to Riggs Glacier. Top notch crew, and accommodations. Personalized tours and attention. No other operator in Glacier Bay offers anything close to this experience. The boat is a converted WWII Navy Minesweeper made of wood, and gloriously restored. The chef on board (Tom) catered to our special diet, and is a master in the galley. I don't know how he produced such amazing meals in such a small space. I highly recommend this adventure. There was nothing to dislike. Bears, mountain goats, whales, sea lions, sea otters, eagles, icebergs, and glaciers.

I was surprised to see several kayakers in the area. There were also a couple of eagles, one of which perched on the glacier. It was somewhat foggy but was so pretty. Next the ship went to john Hopkins inlet where there are about five glaciers, most which have receded. John Hopkins glacier is in a spot called jaw point and it's a picture perfect spot. Lamplugh glacier had a lot of silt. There were many small waterfalls in the area between those two glaciers. In addition, there was a beautifully colored rock formation on the way on.

For us, scenery was actually better in College Fjord, but that was also influenced by mostly clear conditions in latter and mostly cloudy in former. Getting picky here....you'll have a blast.

I went to an afternoon, two evening, and one morning ranger led walk/talk. I guess my only complaint about that was that the evening programs were repetitive. Not every program needs to have the history of the park, the same John Muir photos, etc. I would love to have learned more about whales, ocean life, bears, plants, etc. On the tide exploration walk, I think it would be helpful for the Rangers to know more about the various seaweeds, etc. because we didn't see many critters.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We stayed for a few days at an inn in Gustavus, and took the ferry for a one day trip into Glacier Bay. The ferry is very comfortable--snacks, basic beverages and a sandwich lunch is included in the ticket. A park ranger provides narration periodically throughout the trip, which lasted about 7 hours. It almost reminded me of a theme park ride, as for the first few hours there are various wildlife sightings to keep you interested, start with a few wales, then the sea lion island, then bears and goats. During this time it becomes more mountainous, with spectacular scenery. The finale is arriving at the glaciers, for which you can't really describe the beauty. I know most people view this area via a cruise ship, but I think the ferry works out well, as you are quickly able to walk around to view things. A must-see if you are in SE Alaska! Tips: Binoculars are provided. Dress in layers, as it gets increasingly colder the farther you go. The return trip takes a few hours--there are tables on the ferry, and some people brought games or activities for their kids, which was a great idea.

With cruise ships, a park ranger comes aboard to help explain what you are seeing. You are more likely to see glaciers calving in the spring, but it can happen anytime.

Wear sunscreen if you do this, but also have warm clothes ready as the wind in the bay will drastically change the temps. We saw orca whales, humpback whales, puffins, otters, seals, and sea lions. The main negative of this site was the park ranger who boarded us to do the commentary.

This was the way to to that and it was 100% successful for us. We had good weather (maybe had it been raining I would have been less thrilled) but it was great, and we saw whale (not very close, but we say and heard them), and saw sea otters (lots of them) and sea lions and mountain sheet and many birds, lots of incredible eagles and many glaciers up close and personal, and we heard them and saw ice fall off, just like on national geographic. We also were treated to some special sites that not everyone is lucky to see, a moose, a grizzle bear, and a wolf. Food on the boat was ok, not extra fancy (sandwiches) but just fine.

The combination of all these things is what made sailing through this area more than just pretty, and instead made it a special life experience. Glacier Bay National Park. In the ""little ice age,"" which ended in the 18th century, this area was all glaciated. Retreat of the glaciers left ample evidence of itself in the geology it shaped, and several glaciers remain to see. A lot of glacial reorient in last year's in particular. Only one, Margerie, is calving often enough to make a likely appearance during a visit here.

The Marjory Glacier which is like a Highway from heaven is breathtaking and we had a chance to see it up close. There were huge chucks of ice falling off and the sound was really delightful. As we came towards the glacier, it was spell bounding to see a lot of Alaskan Flora and fauna in its bloom. The best way to experience is to be out on the open decks with your binoculars and you can see a lot of things. If you are lucky you will see whales as well.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"A trip through glacier bay should be on everyone's travel list. Honestly, as pretty as the photos are, they do not compare to actually being there and taking it in through all your senses. When you start to see the icebergs floating in the water, you are getting closer to the glacier and the air will begin to get colder. You may see flocks of gulls floating by on the icebergs. At this point, you will be so happy to have booked a room with a balcony on your cruise ship where you can sit and enjoy the beauty so close in front of you. You will feel very tiny next to all the massive ice. When you finally get up close to the glacier, the range of colors and the intense blue of the ice will capture your sight and then if you are lucky, you will hear the white thunder and witness the calving of huge chunks of ice fall to the water. Be sure to pack your binoculars for even closer views of the glaciers and the wildlife along the way.","June 18, 2015",Majestic beauty beyond words,32,Illinois,5

From 7 am in the morning till 4 pm in the afternoon the views were spectacular and the wildlife including humpback whales, sea otters, and seals, were a wonderful surprise. Of the glaciers we visited the Margerie glacier was the most spectacular and we were fortunate to see a huge calving in progress. Some suggestions: have binoculars and camera ready at all times, head outside very early just as the ship is entering Glacier Bay, as this is where the sea otters can be found, wear sunscreen and sunglasses and dress very warmly as despite beautiful sunshine it is icy cold. Finally do stay outside for as long as you can. We found the more we looked the more we actually saw. Luckily the Holland America crew brought us hot soup whilst we were on deck.

We chose the Holland America cruise line (which was a good choice and I will review them separately.) Just wanted to confirm what nearly everyone else concludes and that is, it is worth the effort to see the glaciers. Glacier Bay is awesome and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it would appear to be fading fast. Really, you have to look hard to find the glaciers. The cruise line did its very best to position us so that we could experience some ""calving"" and we did. One can only imagine what it might have looked like even a hundred years ago. My advice is to go see it for yourself but expect to be surprised at how the glaciers have receded.","June 11, 2015",Definitely worth the trip,76,Tennessee,4

Never seen anything like this before.It was cold outside but I preferred to stay out there almost all the time, not to miss out on anything. It was so much fun watching the sea otters all around us. When the boat was moving, you could see the big round heads and the paws while the otters, laying on their backs, were bobbing in the waves. Eventually they'd dive coming up again behind the boat with their prey. The cutest thing I've ever seen.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"This was one of the best (and least expensive) excursions we took while touring Alaska last August. After a 45 minute fast boat ride to ""the point"", we met with our tour guides who provided us with (included in tour) a fast lunch of a large sandwich, chips, cookies and drinks. They were all extremely knowledgeable about glaciers in general, and of course the Davison Glacier. We loved ""Sam"" who was so helpful and answered everyone's questions with full authority. We then got onto a school bus which took us on a short drive to the ""staging area"" where everyone was fitted with boots, raingear, and life jackets. We then walked a short hike to the 10 person canoes where we boarded and began to row. The canoes were fitted with engines, so we had the option to use them and it afforded us more time when we did reach the Glacier. Beauty abounded at every turn on the trip. The guides had gone up to the Glacier earlier in the morning and determined it was stable enough for us to walk on it for a short distance. What a great surprise. The advertisement notes that you will ""get up close"" in the canoes, however, we were so excited that everyone was able to walk on the glacier. Our guides were very strict in where you could go and how far and had instructed us where not to go. In fact, one family was far ahead of their 10 year old who decided to walk on the silt sand (which we were all instructed not to do as you can sink quickly) and a guide quickly and gently pulled him away and advised the parents that he would have to stay with her for the rest of the journey.

Then you go to Glacier Bay and really get some perspective. Seeing these magnificent wonders in person really takes your appreciation of glaciers, and of nature in general, to an entirely new level. I was fortunate enough to visit Glacier Bay on a cruise. In fact, this particular cruise was chosen because it did visit Glacier Bay. The cruise ship was on the smaller side, and I was able to see three different glaciers - Margerie, Lamplugh, and John Hopkins. The ship entered Glacier Bay with Margerie on the left, so we were able to sit on our port side balcony and enjoy the view. When the ship turned, we went to the main deck. The weather was drizzly, but not too cold. I wish it had been a sunny day, but this IS Alaska, after all!There was a naturalist on board, and she remained silent during the glacier viewing so you could get a true sense of the remoteness and isolation. Being able to hear the glaciers ""talk"" was really neat. You could hear creaks and cracks, and could even often predict which sections may produce calving. Margerie Glacier produced significant calving while we were there. Kayakers and campers that were exploring the area helped to provide a better sense of scale.My only complaint is that my time in Glacier Bay seemed so short! But then again, I guess you can say that about almost anything when you are on a vacation.","December 6, 2014",Awe Inspiring!,68,"Ridgecrest, California",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We arrived in Glacier Bay by cruise ship and the ship sailed around the Bay visiting a couple of the glaciers (Grand Pacific, John Hopkins and Geikie) that come down to the sea. On board was a ranger/naturalist who gave an interesting commentary while the ship proceeded around the Bay. It was a glorious sunny day and it was great sitting on our balcony listening to the commentary and basking in the sun after a few rainy days elsewhere. The ship arrived early in the morning and by lunch time we were steaming back out of the Bay past colonies of seals.However, the glaciers are very small and retreating. A map supplied to us on the ship really reinforced how much the many glaciers had retreated over the years. (Climate Change?) By comparison to those near Juneau, on South Georgia Island and in Antarctica they are very small. As part of the cruise they are fine and you can't avoid them on most cruises, but it doesn't stop one from being disappointed.","November 15, 2014",Disappointing by comparison,473,Brisbane,4

Ranger Nicole Schuab clearly loves her job and has the ability of channeling her enthusiasm to those of us who attended her inspirational presentation. She told us about John Muir, an engineer and naturalist whom we can thank for the preservation of this and many other wilderness areas in the USA. This is what he wrote in 1870 after spending time in Glacier Bay:""These beautiful days must enrich all my life. They do not exist as mere pictures - maps hung upon the walls of memory to brighten at times when touched by association or will, only to sink again like a landscape in the dark; but they saturate themselves into every part of the body and live always.""I am planning my next visit to Glacier Bay, this time not sailing on a cruise ship but paddling around on a kayak to really experience the beauty and serenity of this wilderness.","November 7, 2014",Wild and magnificent,11,"Venterstad, South Africa",5

Even though it was frigid and the wind was whipping up, I (and probably everyone else witnessing such an amazing view) felt the overwhelming calmness and serenity of the bay. This was no port stop but rather a full day of scenic cruising, a circling of the ship in the bay to enable us to capture the stunning views from every possible angle, and to glean information about the park from park rangers who were on board to answer questions and to give informative commentaries. The entire panorama and beauty of those immense chunks of ice in such a breathtaking setting was an experience that I will never forget. If you plan to visit Alaska, don't miss Glacier Bay!

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Glacier bay national park was part of our cruise on Norweigan in August as we celebrated my moms 70th birthday. We entered the park early in the morning and it was breathtaking as we walked towards the front of the ship. The enormity of the glaciers was amazing. It was also amazing to hear the glaciers when it would calve into the water. We toured several of the glaciers during our visit to the park. The captain would position the boat so that all sides could get a view and would then re-position for the other side to witness the beauty that surrounded us. Our day in glacier bay was sunny and clear. We didn't see any wildlife like we had hoped but the beauty of the glaciers were spectacular to be able to view. Glacier bay naturalist boarded our ship that morning as we entered into the park and they kept us informed over the loud speaker about each of our stops along the way explaining in detail what we were viewing. They were welcoming if you had any specific questions and you could tell that they really enjoyed their job. They had a nice table set up with things for sake.

We reached the end of Tracey Arm fjord at about 2 PM where we observed the Margate and Pacific glaciers. Tom recalled seeing the Pacific glacier when he was here last in 2007 and not much has changed (other then it was rainy back then). After spending some time at that glacier and with conditions so great, the Captain decided to go up a second passage to the John Hopkins glacier. This is the first time the Statendam has ever ventured up this passage This is a Seal pups breeding area and usually restricted to cruise ships. The John Hopkins is twice as big as the Pacific Glacier and we spend a long time in this fjord. Took ten zillion pictures and video!!Viewed these glaciers in September about 8 years ago when it was raining and overcast (very dissapointing). We lucked out this time.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"If you are expecting what I expected, you might be disappointed. I had expected cruising among big icebergs and miles and miles of ice walls. In fact, most of the glaciers have retreated from the water's edged over the past 100 years, and only two (Lamplugh and Margerie) still calve off ice at the waters edge. We were on board one of the smaller cruise ships which allowed them to get in quite close to the ice cliffs, and they are careful to make sure both sides of the boat face the ice at times. This is one of those times when having your own deck is worthwhile as the upper open decks are crowded along the side facing the glaciers. The noise, the white/blue/black colours, and the smell of cold old-ness (its an odd organic smell) and acridness (not really salty, more of an alkaline smell) are distinctive. We did not see any wildlife in the bay except for birds (seagulls and snow geese); no seals, sea lions or whales. Just the ice and the rocky recovering landscape with low shrub growth and a few oddly conical trees. As we left the bay itself and cruised past the Brady icefield (which is huge but also no longer reaches tidewater), 2 or 3 humpbacks broke the surface along a tide rip, and seals and sea lions were evident. Once you get over your initial expectations, it's still pretty awesome.","October 11, 2014",Pretty awesome,150,"Vancouver, Canada",5

It was very low cloud when we traveled through part of the area however it didn't take away the mystery as the ship pushed through the ice that lay in the ocean.,"October 6, 2014",Absolutely Crazy!,60,"Kelowna, Canada",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Breathtaking! Amazing! Beautiful! What an experience! On Friday 19th September 2014 we sailed down to the Johns Hopkins Glacier. Yes, majestic. Yes fantastic blue colouring. Yes a huge glacier (reputed to be circa 1 mile across, 9 miles long, still advancing - unlike many others). Approximately 250 feet high at the face (above water line) and 200 feet deep under water. But what made it absolutely magic for us was the calving. In September you can expect to see some calving, but we saw a huge event on the 19th. A very special display by nature! A massive section of ice on the face slipped into the water, with a thunderous roar, as we watched with awe (approximately 1/4 of the face of the glacier calved). This was an experience that will never be forgotten by us. We hope others have an opportunity to visit, and possibly see, this wondrous force of nature.","October 2, 2014","Johns Hopkins Glacier, Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska",18,"Adelaide, Australia",5

The mountains, glaciers and the bay itself, are so large, Holland America's massive MS Oosterdam (the other ship visiting at the same time) was dwarfed by the background. The often photographed Margerie Glacier is 1 mile wide and 25 stories tall; and the ""dirty"" Grand Pacific Glacier is more than 2 miles wide.Glacier Bay National Park is such a remote wilderness area that it is only accessible by sea or air.

Early in the morning, Park Rangers boarded our ship and provided a narration of the area and wildlife throughout the day. The weather that day was beautiful and the ship was able to travel closer to some of the glaciers than during prior cruises due to better conditions. We spent some time on the top deck and then spent the rest of the day on our balcony. It is so serene and tranquil-- one of the last untouched places in the world where ""nature still rules"" (one of the best quotes from the rangers). The views really took my breath away. We did get to see some wildlife as well-- a seal floating on a piece of ice, bald eagles.

The rangers joined the ship and narrated over the loud speaker the entire time we were in Glacier Bay. There was an indoor area where you could go talk to the rangers and ask questions. They were very good at spotting the wildlife and pointing out things we would have missed. If your kids are 12 or younger they can do the junior ranger program, learn a lot and get a cool badge. We loved this day. Also go watch the rangers get from the ship back on to the little boat that brought them out. They transition while the ship is moving! I would go back!

What made Glacier Bay a special experience for us was seeing the progression from forested areas when first entering the Bay to the bare glacier cleared soil areas and the large number of different looking glaciers at the end of the bay area. Also, the day was clear and the reflections from the mountainous area looked almost identical to the mountains themselves. We watched almost the whole day from the balcony of our cruise ship and the entire passage was breathtaking.

The captain made sure that there were views of the glaciers from all sides. It was so easy to sit back, relax and enjoy the view from the ship without having to disembark and take a small boat and hike. Your views would be limited; you would not get the full picture. Glacier Bay is massive, the best way to see it is definitely from the ship. I remember looking out the window during lunch and it was like looking into another world.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"They say that 95% of the people that visit Glacier Bay do so on cruise ships, and never set foot on the land surrounding the Bay. Of the rest, most fly in one afternoon or evening, take the day boat the next day, then fly out that night (an experience in itself, since you have to take a small plane - the way real Alaskans travel to communities that aren't reachable by driving). But there is much to be gained by staying a second night. Of course, the trip on the day boat is mandatory for the first day. With the smaller boat, you get to go much closer to the glaciers and the wildlife than the cruise ships can go. Both have the same NPS Rangers guiding the tours (the Rangers rotate among cruise ships, the day boat and the Visitor Center), but the passenger to ranger ratio is much lower on the day boat, so you can get more personal attention on the day boat. It is also much easier to stop the day boat to watch wildlife on the way - we spent 15 minutes or more watching a bear turning over rocks to get at the seafood underneath them. The second day was the unexpected surprise. There are some nice, pretty-easy hiking trails near the Lodge and Visitor Center. Because so few people hang around to use them, you can actually get some solitude. And the Rangers lead guided walks at scheduled times, which are like private tours: there were only two visitors on my morning walk, and four or five on the afternoon walk. On the morning walk, the Ranger asked us whether there was anything we particularly wanted to see; since we were near low tide, we got an amazing tour of the plants and animals that live in the tidal area, with the Ranger turning over rocks (albeit smaller than the ones the bear had turned over the previous day) to show us what was living beneath them). We also got to see the beautiful sea anemones growing on the sheltered sides of the dock. (Even if you don't have a Ranger to point them out, you can see them when you board or disembark the day boat - if you take the time to look.). All in all, a wonderful experience.","September 7, 2014","Miss the boat, er, the ship!",40,"Beverly Hills, California",5

We spent many hours standing on deck in a cool breeze snapping pictures, and I did not notice the time passing. The glacier is massive and powerful. Periodically a large part of it would collapse into the sea, a truly thrilling sight. We were lucky to have a sunny day, but I don't think any kind of weather would have deterred us from watching for hours. The only disappointment was that we could not hear the ranger who was narrating the visit to the glacier. She spoke softly and it was a bit windy. I missed much that I would have liked to know. But the view was breathtaking, and I was sorry to leave. Instead of heading inside, though, we stood at the rail for many more hours watching for wildlife, and were rewarded with many interesting and unique birds, sea otters, sea lions, and even a whale.

We just slowly cruised around the icebergs in the water and the ship stopped to view the Majorie Glacier. Everyone was gathered out on the decks in their winter garb but even though it was cold, it was worth every minute. We were not allowed to have any outside music and were instructed to keep the noise level down. We got to experience one very small calving, which had everyone in awe, when about 5 minutes later, a thunderous rumbling began and suddenly a huge chunk of the glacier calved into the water. I was so fortunate to be taking photos as it occurred. When the chunk hit the top of the water, it turned into what looked like a sheet of ice on the top of the water and minutes later our cruise ship was hit with the rocking from these large waves.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We spent 2 weeks in Alaska, traveling to 10 different towns and this was by far the worst day of our trip on a 8 hour cruise from Bartlett Cove, visiting the Glacier Bay National Park. This is the catamaran cruise from 7 30 to 3 30 pm that cruises the bay. The supposedly narrated cruise would have been better off without any narration because the microphone was so old that it was impossible to understand a word the ranger was saying. The ranger was great with the children, and did lots of activities with them. But she said very little to the adults throughout the trip, and again the microphone did not function ! Furthermore, we did NOT see much wildlife on this tour, whereas we saw a ton of wildlife on the other two cruises we did in Alaska. The best was the Prince William Sound tour and the Kenai Fjords tour near Anchorage and Seward were incredible experiences. This Glacier Boat needs a major review of its operations. The only wildlife we saw on the tour was a bunch of sealions sitting on a rock under a fog, so hard to see and 2 mountain goats high up on the mountains. That is pretty much, and a few seagulls, etc. We did not see any whales whatsoever. the narration and the captain was so bad that they did not even point out any of the sea life we saw, I noticed some puffins and otters on the water and yelled out to people. On the way back, the tour becomes a ferry, traveling 3 hours non stop without any narration and picks up kayakers on the way. So the last half of the trip is even more boring. This boat trip needs a major face lift, better microphone, and they have to do a better job pointing out and looking for wildlife....all the other boat tours we did, had the required wildlife we were looking for....Waste of day....Food was disorganized as well. They gave a 4 oz salmon chowder in a cup at 11 am and waited till around 1 30 pm for the sandwiches. People lined up around noon asking when lunch would be served, and when it was time for lunch,the line was so long that we all had to wait, and when it was our turn, they only had ham sandwiches which most people did not want.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Our visit to Glacier Bay was, by far, the highlight our our Alaskan Cruise.Glacier Bay National Park consists of 3.3 million acres of mountains, glaciers, rainforests, and fjords. It’s part of a 25-million acre World Heritage Site and is one of the world’s largest internationally protected areas. The ice in the bay is melting at an alarming rate. In 1794, when Glacier Bay was first surveyed, the entire bay was filled with a glacier that was a half-mile thick and 20 miles wide. By 1879, naturalist John Muir discovered that the ice had retreated more than 30 miles forming an actual bay. By 1916, the main glacier, Grand Pacific Glacier had melted back 60 miles. If you’ve seen pictures of Glacier Bay, they were probably taken 10 years ago when Grand Pacific was twice as tall as is now. Ten years from now, it will probably be half as tall it is now. To protect the fragile ecosystem in the park, the park severely restricts the number of cruise ships that can enter Glacier Bay. I’m glad we were one of the few guests to have the opportunity to be here while there’s still something left to see!Three Park Rangers boarded our ship early this morning. The first Park Ranger presentation today was at 7am. The rangers outlined the plan for the day, explained what we would be seeing, and answered questions about the park.As the morning fog was lifting, For this part of the cruise, everyone wore wearing parkas, hats and gloves even though it was early August.The first thing you notice about the area inside the park is the complete lack of trees. Even though this entire area is classified as a rain forest, there is not one tree in sight. Why not? There’s certainly plenty of water, it rains here almost every day. There’s enough sunlight, even though it rains often, the sun often pierces through the fog. The landscape looks like the tops of mountains where the “tree line”, marks the altitudes above which it’s high for trees to grow. But, we’re at sea level! Why no trees? The answer is that the other essential ingredient for a forest is soil. All of the land here has been scraped clean by glaciers. There is no dirt! Near the receding glaciers, all of the landscape is exposed rock. Farther from the glaciers, moss and algae cling to the rocks living on the thin layer of dirt that has accumulated after centuries of exposure, giving a green texture to the shoreline. There is some wildlife here, like mountain goats but, unfortunately, too far away for us to see.The ship arrived at the innermost cove of the bay at 9am. The huge Grand Pacific Glacier was straight ahead of us. At this time of year, it wasn’t very photogenic. The nose (the wall at the front of the glacier) is dark from all of the dirt that the glacier has pushed along as it slowly moves toward the sea. Margerie Glacier is right next to the Grand Pacific Glacier and is currently much prettier. This is the highlight of any Alaskan cruise. This is what we came so far to see! The ship slowed turned 360° several times so that everyone had a chance to appreciate the sparse beauty of the scene. It’s hard to comprehend the size of these glaciers from the photos. On the intercom, the ranger tells us that most of the nose these two glaciers is underwater. The portion of Margerie Glacier that’s above the water is about 25 stories high. That makes it about twice as tall as our cruise ship!Both of these two glaciers are “calving” at this time of year. For a glacier, “calving” means that large chunks of the glacier fall into the sea becoming icebergs. The ranger says that this glacier is calving several times an hour at this time of year. I witnessed this happening several times. Every time we heard a rumbling from the glacier, all of us would rush to the railings hoping to capture another calving event with our cameras. Unfortunately, the glacier is so large and so far away that I couldn’t capture these infrequent and unpredictable events with my camera. Often, I could only see the splash as the ice falls into the sea. Later in the morning, the ship went visited other coves and other glaciers. But, nothing could compare with the Tarr Inlet surrounded by both the Grand Pacific and the Margerie glaciers!","August 28, 2014",Enjoy this National Park if you're fortunate to have a chance,69,"Tilton, New Hampshire",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,We visited National Glacier Bay park abroad the Cruise ship on August 21st. We arrived in the park early morning. Weather was beautiful twitch no cloud in the sky. Every Glacier was worth watching. We would hear a big thundering should followed by ice coming off the glacier. It is a must visit area if one is visiting Alaska. Scenic view alone is out of this world. Global warming is showing its true colors here. I would visit this attraction again.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We flew into Gustavus to take the boat tour in Glacier Bay based out of the Glacier Bay Lodge. It cost a lot of money to fly in, take the boat tour and fly out. Initially we were going to stay at the lodge overnight, glad we didn't. It did not appear to be someplace we would have wanted to spend much time. The boat tour was ok, but rather than viewing a lot of Glaciers it was more of a wildlife tour in the hopes you would see the animals. There were a great deal of younger children on the boat and quite frankly the lack of supervision ruined the trip for us. There were two young girls who were playing hide and seek on the upper inside deck and who were asked to go below on at least 2 occasions. These were children, the parent or supervising party should have been told to keep the children in line, the crew obviously did not do that. When we began getting closer to one of the Glaciers there was a cruise ship in front of it which I was able to get only a glimpse of because of the number of people on the top outside deck and no one on the viewing side would step back to let others see.. I was never able to get a photo and would have been a good one because it showed how large the glacier was with the cruise ship in front of it, the ship looked like a miniature. When the boat finally turned so I could see the glacier it was a spectacular sight, only to be ruined again by people who could not control their children and the people who were on the other side and had already viewed the Glacier squeezing their way to the rail on the other side. Rather than marveling at this sight and listen for the cracks in the glacier and watch the calving these children and their parents couldn't keep their mouths shut for 30 seconds. The boat was far too crowded, the food offered was lacking in quality, the crew on the boat did nothing to keep children in line or make any announcements to share the viewing areas, and quite frankly I was glad when it was over. Then to make matters worse, when I checked on our shuttle for 5:30 they neglected to put us on the list, so we had to take a bus to the airport two hours before our flight was scheduled. When we arrived the earlier flight had not taken off yet and I checked to see if we were able to get on that flight. It turned out there was two empty seats, the agent just couldn't figure out her computer to put us on it. So we sat in a very small airport for 2 hours with nothing to do. The airport had a café type area, but it was closed. It had a small gift area and unfortunately the homemade soap in it was very odoriferous. The smell was terrible and I had a reaction to it. This trip for me was a waste of money and I wouldn't recommend it. It just wasn't worth the time, effort or money.","August 16, 2014",Won't go there again,12,"Butte, Montana, USA",2

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"In order to enjoy this location, it is advisable to book a trip on the Glacier Bay Boat Tour. The ranger led walks are very instructive for understanding the wildlife and vegetation succession in the bay. If I were to go again I would do a rafting trip to see more animals and enjoy the park more. The tour boats are not allowed to get within 1/4 mile of any whale or porpoise so if you want to see the large sea or land mammals up close I would suggest going out on a raft. There are no cruise ships allowed near the head of the John's Hopkins inlet until September, but the boat tour can go in after July 1 when the seals have had their pups. I also recommend Annie Mae lodge (www.anniemae.com/) where we stayed. They can make all your arrangements for you in a package deal.","August 7, 2014",Beautiful Glacier Bay,9,"Denver, Colorado",5

I took the Glacier Bay Boat Tour from the dock at Glacier Bay Lodge and enjoyed every minute of this lovely tour. Margerie Glacier at the end of the bay is one of Alaska's few stable glaciers (that is not currently receding) and we got much closer to the glacier than is possible in a cruise liner. I loved seeing the blue ice! The weather alternated between sunny and overcast, and was of course a bit chilly up close to the glaciers. In addition to seeing otters, seals and bald eagles, we were lucky to see a couple of brown bears along the shore. The boat itself was clean and there is plenty of viewing area.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We recently went on an Alaskan cruise on Holland America. One of the stops was to sail into Glacier Bay. It was magnificent. The ship just sat in the bay as we watched the glacier and waited for the sound. The sound you listen for is the sound of thunder. After you hear that sound you know the calving is going to start. That is when chunks of the glacier falls off. It is so peaceful to watch this wonder of nature. Also, we were there on a cloudy day which is when the glacier looks the most blue.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"A few suggestions for those contemplating what was a superb cruise for us, from Seattle to Glacier Bay and back.1.When you arrive at Seattle, make sure you find a HAL person in a red shirt to take you to the shuttle for the hotel. Do not try to follow the written instructions for this in the information from the line, which is confusing and possibly wrong.2. When you go on board, a guy will tell you to make sure to make dinner reservations, otherwise you may wait, etc. You can do this if you want, but we found out that there was no problem getting immediate seating on a walk-in basis – if you are willing to share a table. If you want some different treatment, discuss this with the maître-d’ on your first night on board.3. The Pinnacle Grill is a nice restaurant to try out, but if you can’t get a reservation, don’t commit suicide or anything. The food in the Vista dining room is very, very good, and make sure you have the Surf and Turf the night it is offered.4.Take advantage of the offer for special disembarkation if you are flying home right after the cruise. This allows you to do your airport check-in on board. You get your boarding passes, and you check your bag right through to your destination. You don’t have to do anything at the overcrowded zoo of an airport that SeaTac is, other than go through security, and the system works, i.e., our bags arrived at our destination (and there is a safe follow-up system in case you bag goes astray).Other than that, nothing to be concerned about. Holland America does a great job of making your travel easy.","August 3, 2014",Helpful Hints for Glacier Bay Cruise on Westerdam,98,"Lewistown, PA",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"This review is specifically for the day tour leaving from Bartlett Cove/Glacier Bay Lodge daily. This is a tour captive to Aramark and the lodge, but appears to, thankfully, be run by Allen Marine. The boat and staff are all top notch. Allen Marine operates in other areas of Alaska under their own name, and based on this trip, I'd recommend their tours.We saw glaciers close up. We saw sea otters, many birds, an eagle on a piece of ice, sea lions, goats, and a bear running on the beach. The boat goes up one side of Glacier Bay and back down the other, trying to stay an interesting distance from shore. It also picks up and drops off kayakers along the way, which actually may be one of the most interesting things to watch as the captain carefully maneuvers a rather large catarman to shore and the staff helps people load and unload their gear via ladder.There is someone from the National Park Service on board to provide narrative.All that being said, it is a very long day getting to and from the glaciers, with plenty of time to take naps.","July 29, 2014",Glacier Bay Day Trip,79,"Bellingham, Washington",4
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We booked our cruise specifically to come to Glacier Bay- for being on such a huge boat with a lot of people, you can still get the sense of stillness and peace in the bay when just floating in front the massive glaciers. Park Rangers boarded our cruise and gave informative commentary as we cruised through the various bays. Unfortunately, we did not see much ice falling (calving) from the single sea-bound glacier we saw, but still an amazing experience. Also saw a few whales while cruising out- there was a lot to see in all directions.","July 28, 2014",Truly serene and Arctic experience,11,"San Antonio, Texas",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"The Glacier Bay Boat Tour loads at 7:00 at the dock on the waterfront at the Glacier Bay Lodge. It leaves promptly at 7:30 a.m. with a return at 3:30 p.m. Those staying at the Glacier Bay Lodge can simply walk down to the dock, while those coming in from other lodges arrive by bus. which is one advantage of staying there. Some people were in a rush to get to the upper decks, but we were happy to sit on the first floor of the main cabin, which was close to the galley. They had free hot coffee and tea and Danish rolls right away, a good lunch later, and hot chocolate chip cookies on the return voyage. The Bay itself is spectacular, and along the way to the glacier you hope to see whale and other marine mammals, such as sea otters, but we saw whales later that night just off the lodge waterfront out in Bartlett Cove. I was amazed at how high the glacier is, some two hundred and fifty feet high and even as close as we got, we needed the scale of a nearby cruise ship to gauge its enormity. We were fortunate to see and hear it calve a few times while we were there, dropping huge sheets of ice with a thunderous roar into the waters of the bay. You can hold up your hands and feel the cold radiating off the glacier, which shines blue because of the refraction of the sunlight on bright days. At times you could go up on the top deck with lots of people to take pictures, which was cool and windy, or stay below deck with great views out of the panoramic windows. The comfort level you wanted to enjoy was up to each person. I thought the trip was a great way to experience the Bay, and we were able to see some grizzly bears over on the shoreline on the way up to see the glacier. None of the wildlife is guaranteed, of course, but the captain will do all he can to slow for the most interesting animals along the way. I would say this was a great way to see Glacier Bay, and felt fortunate indeed that the two of us were able to go.","July 28, 2014",Glacier Bay Boat Tour One Day Trip brings it all close.,25,"Dakota, Illinois, Usa",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Whether you come on a cruise ship, a smaller vessel, or whatever, just do it. Coming into Glacier Bay National Park is just a remarkable experience. It's like entering its own planet or universe or something. The views are truly breathtaking, and the number of vessels (especially the large cruise ships) is controlled so it's almost like you are out there alone. Wear lots of layers because it's cold (I mean, it's ICE), but it's really breathtaking and was the highlight of our cruise. (BTW, this is also why I would cruise northbound instead of southbound -- I can't think what it would have been like to see this first and then have the rest of the cruise have to live up to it! We were coming northbound so it was the next to last day of the cruise.)

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"There aren't enough words to describe how picturesque Glacier Bay National Park is. Even the best photographs don't do it justice. You simply have to be floating out in the middle of it all, be surrounded by it and breathe the crisp, icy air to appreciate it. Wildlife is everywhere from eagles to otters to seals to whales. We're not fans of going on cruises in general but seeing Glacier Bay made our AK cruise with Princess worthwhile. A cruise is really the most convenient way of seeing it all although we did see several small boats in the bay which also dropped people off on shore. Our cruise ship made several stops right in front of the biggest glaciers and did slow 360 degree turns. Even the vast deckspace of the Crown Princess was not enough to accomodate all the people crowding the rails so if you go on a cruise to Glacier Bay I HIGHLY recommend getting a balcony stateroom so you can have your own private viewing space. I set up a tripod with a spotting scope. I was hesitant to pack my scope because it's so big and awkward but I was so glad I did--way more powerful than binoculars! The thing you quickly realize on an Alaskan cruise is that you cannot get enough ZOOM. Spotting scopes and high powered telephoto lenses are not overkill. When the family wanted to go eat I set up a camcorder on the tripod and recorded everything else I missed! Get a balcony room!One last note--if Glacier Bay is remotely on your bucket list, do it ASAP. It is heartbreaking how quickly all the glaciers are receding. A few decades ago you couldn't even drive a boat up many of the inlets. It is literally disappearing this very moment and it's not something our grandkids will likely get to see in all its glory.","July 20, 2014",Astonishingly beautiful--see this place before it disappears!,498,"Las Vegas, Nevada",5

It was a bit cold for us as we live in Florida, but we got on our coats, hats, socks and got our cup of coffee and began the 6 hour trip up the Bay. It was beyond words the beauty of the mountains with snow, the valleys and yes the fog. It comes and goes, glaciers make their own weather so we found out. All of a sudden I saw 5 Orca's just passing by coming up for air, I really had to pinch myself. Then I caught something out of the corner of my eye when I went for more coffee...Iceberg! It was the size of a large car and about 9 feet high and baby blue. It is amazing to me that 250 years ago this bay was all land and the glaciers melted over time and formed this bay. Then we came to the Glacier!!!! Frozen beautiful dense blue ice, tall, massive, jagged, loud and words I just don't have to tell the beauty. The thundering sound when a large chunk fell off was the sound of sadness. If you want to see something in your life time that you will never forget, then get to Glacier Bay.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"The morning was cool and overcast as I walked out onto the deck of the Crown Princess, nobility that had just entered one of the USA’s most wondrous national parks, a park of water and ice, snow covered mountains flanked by deep valleys of majestic walls, walls carved out 10,000 years ago, carving done very slowly, bygone glaciers leaving a beautiful pattern of scars, and the wonderment being the realization that if I had been in this same spot in that era of time, I would be frozen in dense blue ice that appeared even as the remaining glaciers I was about to be awed by. Later that morning we approached a jagged cracked wall of ice, ice that appeared locked in time, yet its time was dynamic as ever so slowly it crept toward the fjord created in the last ice age, a motion measured today as six to eight feet per day, and each inch advances the art that Margerie Glacier leaves on the wall of the valley it overpowers. How grateful and small I feel as I view the 250 foot and mile wide front she presents to us today, a front ever-changing as she calves into the bay leaving ice floats, one of which had a passenger, a rider of choice since it could take flight when it choose, a fitting ride for a bald eagle. I wish ever American could see this for themselves, and global warming, the part caused by careless and reckless use of resources by humans might not be such a volatile issue.","July 17, 2014","Glacier is more than a word, it's an experience!",4,"Lynchburg, Virginia, United States",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We took the day trip tour out of Glacier Bay Lodge and had an excellent day of sight seeing. The trip started by seeing lots of otters and a few whales as we left the cove Throughout the day we probably saw over a dozen whales and lots of sea lions on an island. We also were lucky enough to spot 3 brown bears on the shore. We ultimately made our way to the head of the bay where we stopped and watch the glacier for about a 1/2 hour or so. This gave us plenty of time to see several pieces of ice calve off. The weather was also amazing as it was sunny for the whole day, but it was a little windy in the morning. The water was also fairly flat and sea sickness was not an issue for anyone (as far as I could tell). The boat was not a capacity so there was plenty of room to spread out and be able to take pictures without being cramped.The boat had 3 decks with the top deck being open. Since the boat cruised at over 20mphs, it was a breezy, brisk ride if you stayed on top. There was a breakfast in the morning which included pastries and coffee. We also got sandwich's for lunch which were pretty good. An NPS ranger was on board and gave us background on the sights and animals as we made our way up the bay. The staff was very friendly and helpful during the course of the trip and were able to answer all the questions we asked.It was a wonderful trip with nothing but great scenery and would recommend this trip to anyone planning on visiting the area.","July 13, 2014",Awesome day trip!,171,"Littleton, Colorado",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Viewed as a stop on the Inside Passage cruise, this is a not to be missed spectacle. A park ranger comes on board and provides a commentary on the glacier, its history and geology. You will witness the face of the glacier, alongside which is a massive seabird rookery, where you will hear the loud gunshot like report of ice cracking and if you're lucky, witness a large hunk or two of the face break off into the sea.","July 12, 2014",An amazing sight,46,"Melbourne, Australia",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We spent 2 days in Glacier Bay with Ranger Nicole on board the small cruise ship Safari Endeavour in early July 2014. The small ship cruise is always an amazing experience and even better in allowing an up close and personal experience in Glacier Bay. We spent a couple of hours at the Visitor Center at Bartlett Cove. One of the Endeavour crew was a member of the articulation team that put together the remains of Snow, a humpback whale for an exhibit that opened a couple of weeks earlier. So it was very personal to see the exhibit. Then we cruised in the bay for 12 hours. We saw lots of sea lions and sea birds at South Marble Island and got to see the fireworks of a massive caving of Margerie Glacier after dinner on the 4th of July. We anchored in Geikie Inlet about midnight and spent the next 18 hours or so there. All kinds of water and land-based adventures awaited us. Also the site of this cruise's ""Polar Plunge"" experienced by about a dozen passengers and 8 or so crew members.

Our boat parked close to a couple glaciers and we were able to watch the morning sun warm the ice and cause the glaciers to ""calve."" Best part of the trip.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"I visited in 2011, aboard the Golden Princess. The day was quite gloomy with light rain and a very low cloud ceiling. The low clouds really obscured the peaks and mountains, so I did not get to see the Bay in its full glory, but what I could see was incredible and are memories that I cherish every day. Standing atop the ship as it sits silently in the Bay next to the Margerie glacier is an outstanding way to truly experience the majesty and serenity of this magical place. To hear the loud cracks and white thunder when the glacier calves is at once exhilerating and chilling. Watching what looks like basketball sized chunks of ice fall into the water and then when they are floating by the boat, you realize they are bigger than you...the size and scale of this place is enormous.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We took the day tour from Juneau to Glacier Bay NP booked through Alaska Tours. Went over via Wings of Alaska on a 10-seater plane and back via Alaska Seaplanes on a 6-seater Cessna. We should have been told up front that we were booked on two separate flight companies. After the tour we caught the bus back to Wings facility to fly back to Juneau. They had no record of our flight reservation. Finally figured out that flight back was out of a place next door. We were not scheduled to leave for another 3 hours. The wonderful lady there had two empty seats on the next plane out and put us on there--thank goodness. ASK questions and check reservations documents very carefully before you begin this journey!!! Regarding the tour itself--we left from Glacier Bay Lodge. The weather was dismal--rained all day. The only wildlife spotted were sea otters, sea lions and birds. We stopped before a glacier for a while, and it calved once while we were there. Lunch consisted of sandwiches; if you don't want a ham or hummus sandwich, get in line early for the turkey. Complimentary tea and coffee was available all day. My evaluation of GBNP tour is this . . . if you cannot get to Seward to take the day tour, go on this one. However, if you have the opportunity to go into the Kenai Peninsula, that is where you will feast your eyes all day on ALL types of wildlife.

I would have liked to see a very large piece drop. I hear it is almost deafening. You never know with glaciers.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"This was my second trip to Glacier Bay. My first was about 10 years ago and I will go back again. It is stunning and ever changing. So many glaciers squeezed between towering mountains. You will enter the bay from the south where it is wide with gentle sloping mountains. Many ignore this part of the bay, waiting for the second half of the bay where most of the glaciers are located. This is a mistake because a lot of the wildlife hangout in the south part of the bay. We saw Stellar sea lions, bald eagles, sea otters, puffins, whales and lots of other birds. You can also spot this wildlife further up the bay, but probably not as abundant. This is due mainly for two reasons. First, the southern half of the bay fills with plankton, which draws small fish, which attracts bigger fish, well you get the point. The plankton filled water turns a brilliant green. The silt from the tidewater glaciers further up Glacier Bay clouds the water there, so the plankton can’t live there. Second, the salmon swim up the rivers in the south bay to spawn. This attracts the predictors mentioned above. There are several locations about half way up the bay that are good places to spot mountain goats. A National Park ranger will board your ship and give an excellent narrative on Glacier Bay and help spot wildlife. We saw several mountain goats and one grizzly bear. The scenery is really stunning about mid-bay north. The itinerary may vary depending on when you are cruising. I think all of the cruises go to the Grand Pacific and Margerie glaciers near the north end of the bay. Margerie glacier is sparkling blue and white and the adjacent Grand Pacific glacier looks more like a mud flow. Our Ranger explained that the Grand glacier is just like the other glaciers made from compressed ice and snow, but it picked up dirt and gravel along the way, which coated the glacier like chocolate on a Baby Ruth candy bar. This part of the bay is probably the scenery highlight of the trip. There are three or four other arms of the bay that branch off to tidewater glaciers. Depending on time available and conditions, your cruise ship may also journey into that part of the bay. The spectacular Johns Hopkins inlet is also popular for cruise ships, but icebergs or harbor seal pupping season may restrict access. There is only one way into Glacier Bay, so you will exit the same way you came in. This gives you a second shot at wildlife viewing. There is a small island; I think it is called Marble Island, which has a large population of Steller sea lions. Our ship cruise sailed close enough to get a good view of them. This area also had a lot of sea otters and birds. I bought a National Park Glacier DVD, which showed the underwater side of Glacier Bay. Snorkeling or diving Glacier is not an option if on a cruise ship, but you can see what lives there in person if you go to the Sitka Marine museum. It is small, but has an amazing touch pool tank with a lot of the colorful sea stars, anemones and other critters that live in Sitka and Glacier Bay waters. It is short walk from the Sitka tender dock and on the way to the Totem Pole National Park.","June 16, 2014",A must for any Alaskan cruise,250,"San Diego, California",5

You certainly need plenty of warm clothing to venture out on deck to view the surroundings with the outside air temperature below zero C. Saw a couple of whales and plenty of sea otters on the way, at the Glaciers we saw some ice calving with the attendant loud noise when the ice walls hit he ocean. You can probably only get to the place by cruise ship, but if you get the chance, go for it, it's certainly worth it.","May 7, 2014","Visiting Glacier Bay, Alaska.",75,"Melbourne, Australia",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We visited Glacier Bay National Park during our Princess cruise. It is very beautiful, and luckily the day was sunny. We found a nice spot for viewing Marjorie Glacier while on the Coral Princess (can't remember if it was Lido or Aloha deck) that was not obstructed by the blue wind barriers, and wasn't crowded because everyone was vying for a spot on the top deck of the ship.We were fortunate that a smaller ship was sailing in front of the glacier, so we could get an idea of perspective--how truly large this glacier really is. Gorgeous scenery, but I would love to see Marjorie Glacier closer, like the occupants of that smaller ship got to experience. On my bucket list if I ever get back to Alaska.","April 18, 2014",beautiful scenery,121,"Huntington, New York",4

I got a picture of a mother and baby seal on a bouy that actually won a prize at the Nebraska State Fair...my biggest challenge was sorting through the 100s of images to decide which photo was the best!

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We were fortunate to cruise the length of Glacier Bay inlet on board the Allen Marine catamaran ""Alaskan Dream"" - fast, quiet, agile and able to get very close to wildlife, glaciers and anything else of interest to its 34 passengers. The Bay is large and home to many humpback whales in August, diving, playing, hunting - sometimes the problem was which ones to go to. There was a killer whale too. It's when you reach the massive glacier at the head of the bay that the smaller vessels come into their own. The big cruise liners have to stay a few kilometres back but the ""cat"" can get within a couple of hundred metres, where you can hear the ice crack, see chunks fall and take a close look at harbour seals on the ice floes. And if you're lucky, you'll get the sunset of a lifetime to round it off.","February 24, 2014",Worth At Least Five Tripadvisor Green Discs!,199,"Melbourne, Australia",5

The temperature was far below 0 c, and many of us had thick jackets on top of sweaters, hoodies, and scarfs, and fighting the freezing wind, just to be outside the cabins to have a closer view of the magnificent giant crystal like glaciers, when the ship was slowly sailing through this astounding park. We saw a couple of seals resting on the flowing ice pieces at beside our ship, also witnessed a few enormous chunks of ice falling into the sea with thundery sounds.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We cruised through Glacier Bay and it was one of the highlights of our trip. We spent the entire day on our balcony listening to the park ranger on board narrate what we were looking at. There were mountain goats spotted which unfortunatley we didn't see ourselves but we did see puffin, seals floating on chunks of ice, a bald eagle on ice and on the way out of the park we saw countless sea otters and lots of whales. The views were amazing. Seeing the different colors of ice from white to black and differnt shades of blue was so interesting. We heard the calving of the ice twice, which sounded like a gunshot followed by thunder, and the third time we heard the rumbling we actually saw a chunk of ice fall into the water! It was one of the best days I have ever spent with my family just appreciating the beauty of nature around us.","January 15, 2014",Amazing,33,"Bourg, Louisiana",5

I figured that was okay. It did take us to see a lot of glaciers anyway.But our second cruise did go to Glacier Bay. As one of the comics joked after our day there, ""How long can you really stand around looking at a bunch of old ice?""HOURS!!!!!!!We were lucky enough to have a blue sky sunny picture perfect day when we went through Glacier Bay, which helped emphasize the awesomeness of it even more. We were treated to whale sightings galore, even saw some sea otters frolicking about, ice calving, people with binoculars even spotted bears on one of the beaches! The park rangers and the native tribeswoman who spoke on our ship also enhanced the quality of the journey through Glacier Bay even more. In fact, I think I appreciated all I was fortunate enough to be having the chance to experience even more after hearing them share their experiences living and working in that area.

When we were there in September the temp was in the mid 50's which isn't to bad for us from the UK. The sky was virtually clear with only a few wispy clouds. The water was so calm and an amazing blue colour which contrasted with the white of the snow and glacier. The sheer scale of the glacier and that you could see it's path down the mountain was amazing. Even with a cruise ship full of 2000 pax it was still really quiet and peaceful in the bay.","November 6, 2013",Awesome,85,"Newport, United Kingdom",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,We toured Alaska from Anchorage to the Kenai peninsula then Mt McKinley and Denali lodges. We took the Alaska railroad to Whittier and cruised throughout he inside passage....Glacier Bay. If I didn't see it with my own eyes I would not grasp the beauty of this ocean park. As we entered the park waters the ship slowed and a coast guard boat pulled up next to the ship so a park ranger could board. We also had a naturalist onboard for the entire cruise who periodically shared valuable information on the wildlife in the waters. He was extremely knowledgeable and when a whale was spotted he would announce where it was and talk about their habits and habitat. When we spotted the glaciers it was just about the most amazing sight I had ever seen. There was a lot of calving the day we went through. Huge chunks of ice would crash into the sea and it was really awesome to watch. And the color of the ice was a beautiful icy blue/turquoise. The entire afternoon that we cruised through the bay we could see glaciers everywhere. It was truly a blessing to have witnessed a sight of this magnitude. Just gorgeous. This is one trip we will never forget. And the park service was extremely accommodating to our tour group. So grateful for this opportunity.,"October 23, 2013",Absolutely breathtaking cruise through the inside passage,103,,5

The blue color is very unique and beautiful.The Rangers were great! They knew their stuff and were so informative. You could hear the ice cracking and dropping off. Wear warm clothes, it is cold.It was a thrill to see such large glaciers up close. It is just like what you see on National Geographic. Worth viewing for yourself.

It is as wonderful a place as the films of it show and a blessing that so many are able to easily venture so far into this wilderness. I am not a ""cruiser"" and have travelled in the Arctic and wilderness. This was well worth doing and something I would considering doing again even with the 2000 others it was share with this time.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Glacier Bay N.P and Preserve is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen or could ever imagine. I highly recommend traveling to this majestic place to see for yourselves. My father and I traveled through Glacier Bay and the Inside Passages aboard the Wilderness Explorer on the Un-Cruise line. We were out to see for 7-days and spent three whole days inside Glacier Bay; exploring, hiking, kayaking, whale watching... everything! The small size of the Un-Cruise boats allows them to navigate through some of the more shallow channels and gain access to places where few boats are able to go. During our three days in the park our ship dropped anchor and small groups went out on explorations... there were shore walks and stand up paddle boards and hikes up the side of glaciers and lots and lots of kayaking. It was simply amazing. Words can't describe the natural beauty you are surrounded by. It's breathtaking. I highly recommend Un-Cruise if you plan to travel to these parts as they have put together a great experience. The Wilderness Explorer held 76 passengers, which is large enough to have a great diversity of people, but small enough so that you can genuinely get to know just about everyone. And although it took about a day to get used to, it was really, really nice to be completely off the grid. No cell phones, no internet, no television. Just nature, and lots of it.","October 10, 2013",Un-Cruise is Un-Believable!,40,"Seattle, Washington",5

My wife had been many years before, while working on the Sun Princess, and had always wanted to take me there. I can now see why. We were blessed with sunshine, fluffy white clouds and mild temperatures for mid- Septemer and were treated to some of the best scenary I have ever seen. Passing icebergs, Orcas & Sea-otters on the way, we turned into the bay to breathtaking views and sounds. the glacier is stunning and we winessed several 'carvings' when the ice breaks off and falls into the water.A big thumbs up to the Carnival Miracle. I had expected a rather bright, gaudy ship with passengers more interested in drinking and gambling. But the cruise was nothing like it. Everything about the cruise was great. They had a qualified naturalist on board who gave regular updates on what to look out for and ample warning when whales were in the area.If you like cruising, try Alaska and Glacier Bay.

We spent probably about an hour in front of the Margerie Glacier, SPECTACULAR!! There were about a half a dozen times the glacier Calved right in front of us, a couple we were lucky enough to get on video! We also got a rare look into the John Hopkins glacier because we were there so late in the season, usually the boats can't get back there because of the ice shelf filled with seal pups.

We saw both the John Hopkins and Marjorie Glaciers and the scenery was stunning in its beauty. The glaciers were glistening in the sun and the icebergs and silt were also interesting. We saw seals sunning themselves on icebergs which was cool.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Demanding but amazing: we landed (alighted) by seaplane at the end of Glacier Bay and loaded the kayaks with tents and food, and started our week long kayak and camping journey down Glacier Bay. First, enjoy being alone in a strictly mineral land, then approach the glaciers, seracs breaking and ice thundering down into the very waters you travel. Vegetation progressively emerges, and the company of bears calls for careful attention for packing your gear. They have sweet teeth and will even poach your toothpaste bag. Then, meet the moose on the way back to Gustavus. The journey of a lifetime. Further good news? Glacier Bay can only be reached by boat or plane. So you are floating down the Bay on your Kayak, in the company of seals floating on their drifting ice banks, watching your every move, on day 1 of creation, only reminded of the modern reality by the quickly forgotten sail of a cruise ship.For the record this was July and never warm, But a few July's ago","September 20, 2013",Kayaking Glacier Bay is amazing,93,"Geneva, switzerland",5

Chunks of ice fell from her and cracks that sounded like thunder rang out with loud booms. We spent one hour absorbing the wonder of it all.

It was our first cruise ever and it was really great. I will fist say that Holland America made our first cruise experience excellent. We enjoyed our cabin, even though it was an interior stateroom. Our cabin crew kept our stateroom tidy and we looked forward to our turndown service every night because we couldn't wait to see what towel creature we were going to see on our beds. The meals we we had on board were excellent. Majority of time we had our meals in the dining room and indulged in two lunches and one dinner at the Pinnacle Grill. There are minimal extra charge for the meals in the Pinnacle Grill but it was very well worth it and the view from this restaurant is great! My son loved all of the amazing meals there and I swear the Pinnacle had the best coffee. The staff on the ship was very friendly and helpful. The shows we watched, 2 comedy shows and one music show were very good. We enjoyed the ports but being from the Pacific Northwest the scenery is similar and though always beautiful it wasn't why we were on this cruise. Glacier Bay was the reason.The main reason for this cruise was to get into Glacier Bay and see this amazing National Park. The natural beauty is not to be missed. Our ship got it very close and since there was only 1900 or so people on our ship it was still very easy to get great pictures and views of the Glaciers. Marion Glacier our first and main stop was simply spectacular to see. There was not much calving going on but we did hear the glacier crack and did see some ice break apart, it was still amazing to witness. The National Park Rangers gave excellent informational talks about the park, wildlife and glacier. This was very well done!I would definitely do this cruise again and even on the same ship.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"In June my husband and I took a Princess cruise to Alaska leaving from SF. This was our third cruise and first time to Alaska. We went in early June and the weather was wonderful no rain. The cruise ship was lovely, food very good and entertainment fun. We booked excursions in every place we stopped. The excursions were fun and at times challenging but none of theme could compare to the magnificent sense of peace and tranquility provided by the sights at Glacier Bay. The day we spent in glacier bay made the whole trip worth it. I don't think I will go back to Alaska but I am glad that I went on this trip. Seeing the Glaciers is something that can not be compared to anything else.","September 3, 2013",Highlight of the cruise,21,"San Marcos, California",5

Snacks, drinks and lunch were included. Don’t forget your camera. Binoculars were available. This is the best way to see most of Glacier Bay National Park.On the cruise, we got closer than any of the cruise ships can go into John Hopkins Inlet the John Hopkins Glacier area. Saw a lot of wildlife: bald eagles, otters (we lost count), seal lions, harbor seals with their pups, humpback whales, puffins, etc… I would definitely do the cruise again, as I would imagine no two cruises are alikeThere are a couple of hiking trails that you must do while there - Bartlett Lake Hike, Bartlett River Trail and the Forest Loop trail.

We had a small group and the weather was typical for Glacier Bay (misting and rainy), but we are so glad we did it. We told Lea we wanted to see sea otters and she changed directions on the spot to give us the best opportunity. Lea was very safety conscious and made sure we all had a great time. We saw bald eagles and sea otters along with salmon flying out of the water for most if the trip (they apparently do this when spawning). We saw some otters that were fairly far away until we were almost at the end of our trip when 2 let us get fairly close. One moved away, but the other was happy to pose for pictures and a video.

The ship brings on board the National Park Rangers and an interpreter to talk about the Glaciers as we manoeuvre around the glaciers. To see the different hues of coloring to the creaking like an old wooden door needing oil or a bit a thunder only to find where the next chunk or piece of ice will fall from the glacier into the water. Amazed by this; the ship also offers a seminar if you wish to learn about this or about the land and totem poles.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Our first trip to Alaska on a cruise ship, although not our first cruse nor our first trip to Alaska. The weather was stunning, so it was a memorable trip to be sure. The Holland America booking staff was helpful and responsive as was their system. But this review is really about the Westerdam and Holland America’s approach to cruising. We stayed in an upgraded room on the “aft” of the boat, and it was exactly the right place to stay—the view was always terrific, and there was very little motion at all. The ship, however, was dirty in too many paces, most of the public areas in fact, and it was in a state of general disrepair, I could list way too examples—it was quite surprising to me! The staff was pleasant, but always seemed a bit confused, not quite sure just what to do next. Disembarkation was a test of patience in every ort, standing by in line waiting to get off e ship while the staff seemed to be trying to figure out who should do what and when. So few spoke really any English that ordering a meal was always an exciting adventure, we had no idea if what got would bear any resemblance to what we so carefully tried to order. If you are a beef eater, it was the exception. The roast beef, prime rib and beef wellington were all quite good, although on the 2nd day I had a baked potato that was so dry and over cooked I thought perhaps it had been recycled! I asked for some sour cream to moisten it a bit and was told “we are all out of sour cream”. With less than 15% of the cruise over they were already totally out of it—ugh! Having said that, if you are willing to spend an extra $30 to$50 per day per person to upgrade, the food is quite good – consider it as just a aprt of the price of the trip! The rooms were cleaned each morning quickly, so by the time we returned from breakfast, it was cleaned, and turn down service was timely and well done. But the food… it was pedestrian a r best and most often more akin to dorm food, fuel perhaps, but a long ways from good food. The choices were quite limited as well, and while the servers were friendly, the service was amazingly slow, no matter where you were on the boat. Want a hamburger, “it’ll take an hour.” As one hostess said as we were talking about the quality of the food in one place, we might find it better in the more formal dining room, “but it’s awfully slow” was she ever correct !","August 19, 2013",Holland America ms.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"It was a pretty stellar experience witnessing the calving glacier in Glacier Bay. As another review stated, pictures don’t do it justice, as they do not capture the sound made by the calving or the feeling of cool air. I could have spent the whole day watching the glacier. We watched the glacier from our Holland America cruise ship, and we were facing the glacier from our balcony – PERFECT! This is something you might want to plan when organizing your cruise. It would have been nice if the ship could get closer, which I think they used to do. Consider bringing a zoom lens to get good quality close-up shots, and to capture the calving in action. Also keep your eyes open for beautiful icebergs floating in the water as you approach Glacier Bay – they also make for nice pictures.","August 7, 2013",Natural wonder,763,"Toronto, Canada",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"My wife and I took the Alaska Marine Highway Ferry (M/V LeConte) from Juneau to Glacier Bay. A wonderful 4 hour trip on one of the System's smaller ships. We saw deer,sea otters, moose, etc. along the way. We also had a wonderful breakfast on-board. Upon arrival in Gustavus ( the little community adjacent to Glacier Bay) we were met by a comfortable bus with a friendly driver who transported us to the Glacier Bay Lodge. The Lodge is nestled among Sitka Spruce trees in this part of the immense Tongass Rainforest. The views of the Fairweather Range from the beautiful lobby and dining room are stunning. We found the accomodations at the Lodge to be clean and comfortable. It is somewhat rustic(there is noTV), but that just adds to the experience. We took a day trip with Glacier Bay Lodge and Tours to cruise Glacier Bay. We were supposed to go to Margerie Glacier, but, instead, we were the first boat of the season to venture to the face of Johns Hopkins glacier. It was an experience!! We saw icebergs along the way and as we got closer, the boat pushed ice flows carefully (so as not to get close to the many seals with pups on the ice flows) out of the way to get within 1/4 mile of the glacier. From there you can really hear the noise the glacier makes as it slips toward the terminus. We saw and filmed several calving events (one which really rocked the boat). A very memorable trip and stay.","July 31, 2013",Awe Inspiring!,82,"Tampa, F.",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"After traveling for two weeks we're wrestling with how to rate things since we enjoyed such a variety of places and activities. The Glacier Bay boat tour made the cut for 5 stars.Our trip started out cloudy which was a bit troublesome but ended up being gorgeous and sunny. Captain Cook (yes, her real name) was great as was Ranger Dan. They both seemed to truly enjoy sharing the experience with the people onboard.We saw whales from a distance, sea otters, mountain goats (my favorite), a couple bears, sea lions and various birds. The island with all the birds was great. There are binoculars on the boat that are reasonably strong. It's worth considering getting a camera with a good zoom lens for this trip as it's visually stunning.The glaciers are beautiful. There's not much to say about them that will do them justice, especially when you get up close to them. On a good day like we had the boat will dip in and out of different inlets so you can see different glaciers. It was a mix of enjoyment and also a bit of sadness for us to see these amazing things as you can't escape the thought of their retreat and what is behind that. We were glad to enjoy them while they were still accessible.It was very evident that the boat we were on was the right choice for getting up close to shore. Cruise lines just can't navigate in the shallow waters so we felt like we were getting a much more informative and intimate experience. We even beached the bow to pick up overnight kayakers/campers. The food (included) was good enough considering they're not a restaurant. The smoked salmon chowder was a nice treat. As for travel, the tour has a van that picks you up at the airport. One final note about flying into Gustavus...if you don't use the big Alaska Airlines 737 you will be on a small plane. This is no excuse to skip this trip. Take your Ativan and get flying.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Glacier Bay ranks as the highlight of any Alaskan cruise. We spent a full day cruising up and down the bay, visiting various inlets which are home to one or more of these glaciers. This is a national park and park rangers board your ship to provide running commentary of what you are seeing, explain the natural history and physics of these glaciers and point out the wildlife that is visible from the ship. Margerie and Grand Pacific Glaciers are at the extreme end of the bay and they are magnificent if not starkly contrasting from one another. Margerie is white and actively calving (you can hear thunderous booms as the ice cracks and the plunges into the water), whilst Grand Pacific is brown and rocky (difficult to see at first). Johns Hopkins Inlet, houses a glacier by the same name which is actively advancing and the ice floe at its base is home to a seal breeding ground. Lamplugh Glacier is also located here and you can get quite near it despite being in a large ship. These are but a few of the glaciers in the park. Your trip through here will also include, otters, whales (humpback and orca), bald eagles and much more. My recommendation would be to get out on deck early and find a good spot at a railing to ensure your unobstructed views of this incredible corner of our planet.","July 27, 2013",Breathtaking,11,"London, Canada",5

This was definitely my favourite part of the cruise. If it's not on your itinerary I would recommend including it. You get to spend the day cruising around the bay looking at different glaciers and listening as the ice crashes into the water (calving). We saw eagles sitting in icebergs floating past. The glaciers look huge and it feels like you are quite close. The smaller boats go even closer. The colour of the ice is so blue in places and there are small waterfalls just glowing straight down the steep edges in places.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We entered Glacier Bay on the Coral Princess. Not too far away through the first part of the bay, we saw many whales. Many otters were playing in the water not too far from the ship. Every mile there is one beautiful snow-covered mountain after another. Once you enter the ice field, you will see a number of glaciers. However, Coral Princess was headed for the Margerie Glacier. Again, the ship stopped 1/2 mile from the glacier. You will hear a clap of thunder and the glacier will calve. It's amazing to watch the calving (chunks of old ice breaking off) into the water. The ship rotated during the hour we were there. It is my understanding that only two cruise ships are allowed near the glaciers a day. So you should check with your cruise line if it is part of its itinerary. It was around upper 60s this day in mid-June. We didn't need heavy clothing. The Great Pacific Glacier is also by this one. It is very dirty looking compared to the Margerie Glacier. Afterwards, the Coral Princess headed back. It also stopped at the Lamplugh Glacier. There was no calving going on and it is not as large. But it is it beautiful nonetheless. The ship stayed here for about 1/2 hour, then we left Glacier Bay. During this whole trip, there was a park ranger onboard. He made announcements during the whole adventure into Glacier Bay.

Those without balconies had to stand, cold and wet, on the observation deck to see what we saw unimpeded by glass. The ship will rotate 360 so that all sides of the ship see the glaciers. The glaciers are amazing! On entering and leaving Glacier Bay we saw pods of Orca, breaching whales, seals and Bald Eagles. It was amazing. Earlier,we saw Grizzly Bears. This was the culmination of the cruise and why I did this in the first place. The ports of call were nice, but time was too short and you could not help but feel rushed. The nicest ports were Juneau and by far, Victoria, B.C.

We were absolutely astonished and amazed at the turnaround point when the ship went right up to a glacier, spent a lot of time there. The captain even swung the ship so that both port and starboard passengers got to see it up close and personal. Glaciers are amazing, and this one was a noisy one. Everyone remains quiet during this part of the cruise because you also have to hear the glacier noises to truly experience one. A crack is heard in the distance. You may hear it crack some more, and then that sound turns into a spectacular falling of ice or snow at the point the glacier meets the Bay waters.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"A friend along with his family has migrated and settled down in Vancouver B.C. for the last 8 years. We, a group of 10, decided to visit them and to have a holiday in that part of the US and Canada. At the end of the 23 days' holiday, we visited Alaska, the Canadian Rockies, Seattle and the different places of attraction in Vancouver itself. It was truly an unforgettable holiday. On May 25th morning, the 10 of us took a flight from Vancouver to Anchorage to join the south-bound Alaska cruise on board the Sapphire Princess. We were met at the airport by the Princess' cruise staff, checked in and taken by coach to Whittler Harbor where our cruise-ship was already waiting for her passengers. It was a very scenic drive, filled with oohs and aahs as we passed through snow-capped mountains, majestic lakes and rivers. The scenery to and at Whittler Harbor itself was just breath-taking. The 7 days on board Sapphire Princess was an experience of a life-time. One thing we were really thankful and grateful for was the fantastic weather. It was beautiful weather throughout the duration of the cruise. Even one of the rangers on board the ship with us at the Glacier Bay National Park, described the weather as ""magical"" - such fantastic weather theyhave not experienced for a good couple of years. God was truly good and kind to us. I particularly enjoyed the views of the glaciers, especially that at the Glacier Bay National Park. It was just awesome! The reflections of the glaciers on the waters were mesmerizing!! Several times we managed to see ice chunks calved from the glaciers into the icy waters. Wow! Truly an experience and sights not to be missed. Must say it was a real eye-opener, especially so for us from Malaysia, a tropical country of perpetual sunshine and rain.

On the Statendam , we had a great view from every deck and the Lido Cafe and Rotterdam Dining Room all have floor to ceiling windows- makes this ship a good choice for Alaska .The Marjorie Glacier is the most impressive since it was booming, cracking and calving chunks of ice into the green,silt-filled bay. To the right of Marjorie, is the less sparkling, earth and rock encrusted Grand Pacific Glacier which is twice as wide but doesn't have the amazing turquoise ice chimneys and crevasses. We were able to see a large brown bear on the grassy area on the side of the bay on our way into the bay and a few seals on ice floes around the Marjorie. Two Park Rangers boarded our ship at the Bartlett Cove entrance and gave an informative commentary for our Glacier Bay visit.Due to an unusual lack of floating ice for the beginning of July, our ship was able to cruise into the Johns Hopkins Inlet and spend time as well at the Lamplugh Glacier. This glacier also has the beautiful turquoise ice but not the exciting Marjorie action. Amazing, world-class scenery, Glacier Bay is incredible!","July 8, 2013",Make sure Glacier Bay is on your Alaska Cruise.,70,"Richmond Hill, Canada",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"A whole day on our HAL Zuiderdam Alaska cruise in late May, spent sailing very slowly around the Bay. We were fortunate in having fine weather to allow us an excellent experience close to the glaciers. One of the best days of the holiiday. We have seen several glaciers in other parts of the world - Switzerland, Norway, New Zealand, Chile, Canada, Iceland - but this was one of the most impressive sights of them all.","July 6, 2013","Impressive, a whole day cruising.",110,Notts,5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"The National Park Service allows just 25 permits per day into Glacier Bay. It's huge. We were on the American Spirit, a small cruise ship with American Cruise Lines. We brought a Park Ranger and a Tlingit Interpretive Guide along with us. The weather was perfect and we watched the Marjorie Glacier calve a couple of times. Lots of humpback whales, Stellar seal ions, harbor seals, sea otters, tufted puffins and a wide variety of sea birds. This is one of the trips of a lifetime that you simply don't want to miss. Our small ship was able to get in close to see lots of wildlife. Our Park Ranger and Tlingit guide were excellent.","July 4, 2013",Nothing Like It,270,"Southport, North Carolina",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Glacier Bay was the destination of our cruise and it was a fitting highlight.The ship arrived early in the morning and guides from Glacier Bay National Park boarded to provide expert guidance and commentary - making the experience even more interesting.Our ship stopped alongside Margerie Glacier for a couple of hours to allow guests on both sides to enjoy spectacular views of the glacier and to watch it calve. What we were not prepared for was the noise coming from within the glacier itself - almost like thunder. It was irregular and did not appear to be directly related to calving - no doubt it was the sounds of ice cracking/groaning as the gigantic ice stream pushes it down towards Glacier Bay.Calving was an interesting experience - I had expected it to be lots of large chunks of ice, but surprisingly it was mostly small pieces that would break away. We did see one large segment break loose but the other parts that fell away were relatively small and just about disappeared when they hit the water.As our boat departed we saw *many* sea otters (we initially thought they were seaweed on the surface) as well as plenty of humpback and killer whales. A few of the whales got surprisingly close to the ship!All-in-all, it was a wonderful experience and one of life's adventures that makes you appreciate beauty in all parts of the globe.","July 4, 2013","Experience the ""Noise"" A Glacier Makes!",193,"Melbourne, Australia",5

It is/was a once in a lifetime site!","June 22, 2013",Awe-inspiring,4,"Frankfort, IL",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Although we were cruising around Glacier bay, I am sure from the sights seen from the ship that the inland area surrounding would be as great as the sea one was. The ship spent a whole day getting to the end and retuning again. During this time we were amazed by the ice flows and the magnificent fresh water glacier at the terminal point. The colours were superb and the chance to see a glacier ""calving"" was a bonus. Ok we had a really sunny and still day so the views could bot have been bettered. I would recommend a trip here if you ever get the chance","June 22, 2013",Fantastic Natural Area,125,Cambridge,5

Slow cruise through narrow passages, by small islands and icebergs, between many glaciers... It was a beautiful day, helped by sunny weather and temperature in mid 70s. We spend hours and hours in lounges and on our stateroom balcony, watching glaciers, mountains, sea and iceberg as well as wildlife (about 10 times seeing whales, also numerous sea otters, birds....). Our rangers were knowledgeable and we attended a special presentation given by ranger Andrew. This was informative and entertaining...

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Our cruise ship moved in Glacier Bay very slowly so the Naturalist on our boat could explained how Glaciers are formed and how they move. We saw a ""Caving"" (a slide of a large portion of ice slide into the water with a thunder and a big splash) It was very exciting and not everyone gets to see such a happening, it all happened in Marjerier Glacier. it's a wonderful experience. We saw birds floating on pieces of ice , Sea Lions poking their heads up from under the water and one sunning it self at the mouth of the Glacier. The Glacial ice is different than regular ice. The Glacier ice is very dense and that ice absorbs every color except blue, so you see streaks of blue all through the Glacier. I got a perfect picture of the blue color streaking through the white ice of the Glacier. This area is very cold, gloves, hat,wind breaker and scarf are a must no matter what time of the year you go.","June 20, 2013",Exciting Caving of a Glacier,30,"Henderson, Nevada",5

Had a glorious sunny and relatively warm day, saw whales both entering and leaving the Bay although no bears this time. Some decent iceberg calving at the Margerie Glacier, and we were the only ship (HAL Westerdam) there for the entire day. Surrounding mountains were all spectacular and took many photos. Narration throughout the day on the PA system by park rangers added a lot to the visit. Distressing how much the glaciers have receded since my last visit 13 years ago...how anyone can deny global warming after seeing this is beyond me.","June 18, 2013",Spectacular!,108,"San Diego, CA",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We viewed the glacier from the deck of our cruise ship - the Zaandam (Holland America Line). Apparently only a few ships are allowed in the Bay each day, and we were lucky. There was a lot of floating ice, and we had to go slowly. The other ship (Princess) either couldn't do it, or couldn't take the time, so we were alone in getting right up to the glacier wall to watch it calving. Unfortunately the weather was cold and misty, although the thicker fog did clear as we reached the glacier. The rangers on board gave informative narrative as we approached.We had dressed accordingly, so weren't too cold, and hot chowder was brought round to keep us going!An excellent day, we really enjoyed it.

I have never been so excited and mesmerized in all my life. I recommend a trip to this Glacier. I was able to capture on video and digital still image the calving.

If you have a choice to take a cruise that goes to this park or one that skips it .....choose to go to Glacier Bay you will not regret the choice. I simply can't describe, nor can pictures do justice to this otherworldly experience. The quiet, the intensity, the beauty, the magnificence of this place can simply not be reviewed, it must be experienced. I woke up at 4 am so as not to miss a moment of the experience. I was greeted by my first seal. The sun was sparkling, and the mountains majestic. Soon we began to see small bright blue floating ice. Before long we were in a field of ice. Our photos of an amazing eagle perched on an iceberg is a favorite image. The glaciers themselves were spectacular, but it was the wildlife that made our trip. Eagles, bears, whales, mountain goats, seals, and dozens of adorable sea otters all made appearances on our trip. I could have stayed for days and never stopped looking. This made our Alaska cruise. It is simply a treasured place and I am blessed to have experienced it on a day filled with sunshine and a cloudless sky and sparkling water....simply gorgeous!","May 30, 2013","amazing, spectacular, awesome",71,"Galena, Ohio",5

We must have picked the best week ever, as in Juneau, Skagway and Glacier Bay we had bright sunshine, and the views in Glacier Bay were just incredible. Didn't manage to see any iceberg calving, but the overall views and majesty of the place were just incredible. Seeing it without the typical rain and fog made it perhaps even more stunning than it usually is. Our dates were May 19-26, 2013, and we lucked in to the most beautiful weather imaginable up there.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"The cruise in Glacier Bay was so spectacular that we could hardly believe that such a place could exist. We were aboard Alaskan Dream Cruises ""Admiralty Dream"". Cruising in a small ship gave us the advantage of being up close enough to be within view of the sea lion haul out and the sea bird rookeries as well as a closer view of the Marjorie Glacier. The bay abounded in humpback whales and we got some very good views of them as well. The rumbling and cracking of Marjorie Glacier amazed us. We were even treated to a few displays of the glacier calving pieces into the sea. A native Tlingit guide aboard the ship was very knowledgeable and informative regarding the area. It was certainly educational to hear how the Tlingit regarded Glacier Bay which is their ancestral home and their historical role as conservators of this beautiful area.","May 27, 2013",Almost unbelievable,56,"Wimauma, Florida",5

My wife, special needs daughter and I were entranced by the sights of Glacier Bay. The Glaciers were fantastic and almost too many to mention. The highlight of the trip was at the head of the bay, at the foot of Grand Pacific Glacier when the captain literally spun the ship on its axis so everyone could get a view of both Grand Pacific and Margerie glaciers. The glaciers both towered over us as we stood on the 10th deck of the ship. We saw humpback whales and auks. The weather cleared as we entered the park.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Okay, our family went to Glacier Bay National Park back in 2008. It was a part of our Alaska/Yukon trip. But it still remains our family's favorite trip. Plus, Glacier Bay is probably the most beautiful place that I have ever been to. And I'm saying that after having seen castles in Germany and England, and the Parthenon in Greece, among other things. There's something about seeing snowcapped mountains directly on the bay; a bay deep enough to allow humpback whales in. We took the katamarand (did I spell that right?) tour around the bay. This was an 8 hour trip, but well worth it. We saw humpbacks spouting, a killer whale pod swim by, an upcropping of rocks completely covered with seals, puffins flying by, and a black bear pacing by the shoreline. This was also where my kids got there first Junior Ranger badges. This is a great program that encourages children to learn and have fun while doing so. We spent two nights/two and half days at the lodge on the grounds. The rest of the time we hiked some easy trails around the lodge, just enjoying nature in general. A very exciting trip overall. Highly recommend this park for nature lovers.

Saw mountain goats, sea otters, and when leaving Glacier Bay at the end of the day and entering the Icy Straits to head towards Skagway, saw Orcas and a pod of humpbacks. One of the humpbacks was very active, breaching several times. The amazing thing was how close to this ship all these animals were. Could see with naked eye --obviously much better with binoculars.

It did not disappoint. The ship is able to maneuver itself right in close to Margerie Glacier so that you can really appreciate the enormity of it and the valley it is carving its way though. We saw the glacier calving on a number of occasions which is amazing and heard it groan which is actually a little eerie in such an isolated location. The Park Naturalist onboard kept us eagerly looking for and at all that she pointed out and explained and this was a day to remember forever. We were amazed when told one hundred foot of snow falls to make one inch of glacier ice. That puts the enormity of these giants into perspective.

My day in Glacier Bay kicked off with a bang when we saw a pod of humpback whales less than 200 yards off the side of the ship. From then on, the scenery grew increasingly spectacular, and we saw otters, seals, and dall sheep.

We last saw the glacier in June 2002, & we were amazed how little of it remained. In 2002 there was still a massive wall of ice with huge chunks calving but not now. In another 5-10 years, the whole glacier will probably be gone. The cruise into the bay was great & serene, but if your going there to see a huge glacier, you are in for a big shock. The cruise ships may have to change their routes if the glacies vanishes. I guess that we can always look at the rock where thw glacier was just a few years ago.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"One of UNESCO’s places of outstanding natural beauty and it certainly lives up to that reputation. Like many, we have seen it while on a large cruise ship however; this Bay swallows any size ship with this stunning, pristine wonderland that is Glacier Bay.A couple of Park Rangers are picked up at the entrance to the Bay to help navigate and point out hot spots for wildlife.They take you through the key highlights of this park with a very good commentary. There seems to be more marine wildlife sightings such as Sea Otters, Whales and Porpoises in the first hour or two after entering the Bay. If you are really lucky you may see a Brown bear wandering along the shoreline along with a few bald Eagles.The furthest point you can head to within a short distance of Margerie Glacier (the most stunning) has very deep water. Here the ship's captain navigates safely across the front of the two glaciers without damaging this fragile wilderness. A 360-degree turn gives many vantage and photo taking opportunities. The other wide glacier is the Grand Pacific Glacier, which is silt covered ’black’ glacier.This is the glacier that is continuing to retreat thereby making the bay a little bigger as it does. Not as pretty but a complete contrast in this compact setting. Not a lot of calving happened during our time here perhaps because the weather was still very cold and rainy. Another ship had met up with ours so it was time for them to have the same privilege.The Bay has changed and is changing at an alarming rate. On a cruise 15 years ago the same glaciers we saw on this trip look to have retreated significantly.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Glacier Bay National Park is an absolutely beautiful location REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER.When the weather is clear, the glaciers sparkle clean and blue. When the weather's gray and misty, the glaciers... believe it or not, the glaciers are still beautiful and the bay has a special quality about it -- a peacefulness (though not a quiet) that gives observers a totally different but just as magnificent perspective.The secret that many people -- particularly cruisers who, unfortunately, are limited to just hours in the bay -- forget is that glaciers (and nature in general just never stop. Regardless of whether the weather is sunshiny or not, the glaciers continue to crack and groan and, yes, even to calve.While misty and rain can cause special problems for cameras, they can also present some incredible opportunities for beautiful pictures in very unique lighting conditions.HELPFUL HINTS:1. For cruise guests who have cabins on the starboard (right) side of the ship, I'd suggest finding room on the bow (front) of the ship as you approach the ""end"" of Glacier Bay and Margerie Glacier. From there, you'll be able to see hear and see the glacier as it calves into the bay.2. Cruise guests who have cabins -- particularly verandahs or balconies -- on the port (left) side of the ship may want to watch Margerie from their rooms but, as the ship turns back to the south, will want to do in reverse what the other guests did earlier in the day (i.e., going to the stern or starboard -- back or right -- sides of the ship to watch as the ship pulls away from Margerie.PERSONAL HINTS:1. On my visit to Glacier Bay, I'd seen lots of small pieces of the glacier calve and it was rainy outside so, like most other passengers, I didn't go to the stern as we pulled away from Margerie Glacier... and, because of that, I (yes, like most other passengers) missed seeing the largest piece of ice fall that had calved all day. (Others who had visited Glacier Bay multiple times shared it was the largest berg calve they'd ever witnessed.) AAaaarrrggg! Don't make the same mistake I did.2. As we were exiting Glacier Bay, shortly after the National Park Rangers had left our ship, our Captain announced calmly, ""Ladies and gentlemen, we are SURROUNDED by whales."" Within the first 30 minutes of the NPS Rangers' departure, we saw 29 different humpback whales and several very playful sea lions from our starboard balcony. My advice here is simple: stay alert and have your camera ready. I think you'll be glad you did.","July 23, 2012",The Glaciers Never Stop,131,"Huntsville, Alabama",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"My wife and I visited Alaska in June, primarily to visit Glacier Bay NP. It is the most beautiful, majestic, incredible, awe-inspiring place I have ever been. I exceed every expectation I had coming in (which were very high). We did not come to Glacier Bay like 90% of the visitors do, via huge cruise ship, we spent 10 days in Glacier Bay and saw it up close. The very best thing you can do is take a small ship 4-10 passengers and spend 3-6 nights in Glacier Bay NP. We took the Whale Song boat, a 70 foot, 6 passenger motorized boat, and it was incredible. We spent 4 days in the bay, anchoring in front of Glacier's at night, Kayaking through icebergs, hiking on top of glaciers and sledding down them on our butts, eating amazing food, seeing incredible wildlife up close and personal (including: Breaching humpbacks, swimming moose, seals, otters, sea lions, porpoises, bears, mountain goats, bald eagles, and much more). It was pricey, but is the only way to really see all Glacier Bay has to offer. The cruise ships and day boat tour can only spend a few hours in the bay, and don't offer you chances to really experience the bay. Jumping in the iceberg filled water in front of Margerie Glacier (and getting a hot shower afterwards) is something we will never forget.The other thing we did in Glacier Bay was go Kayak Camping in the Beardslee Islands. A quiet and serene place, where no motor boats are allowed, was fantastic. If you have any experience camping, you can easily go out and camp on your own for a few days. Being alone in the wilderness is what really makes you appreciate nature.Overall, I would highly recommend Glacier Bay NP, but especially if you can visit in a small boat and stay overnight in the Park.","July 9, 2012",Incredible and Majestic,9,Delhi,5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"I don't even know how to put into words they beauty that Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve was and how it impacted my entire trip. But i will try:We entered the Bay via the Norwegian Pearl on Thursday, May 24th - early in the morning. The waters were extremely calm and the sun was actually shining (first time we had seen the sun since setting sail on may 20th). The snow capped moutains mirrored off the water, just like in a painting. A park ranger came aboard to narrate our 20 mile trip from the bay enterence all the way to the Great Pacific Glacier (which had carved the entire path we were traveling) and to Marjorie Glacier. The waters were a green blue color that i had never seen before, the sky was bright blue, the trees so green, the mountains black & brown, and the crisp white of the snow. Beautiful. Soon we saw small ice chunks floating, the closer we got to the glaciers, the larger the ice became. and more abundant. The ranger pointed out 2 bald eagles that were catching a ride on a small iceberg. Wow. This was amazing.When we reached the end of the bay, we could see the GPG. Not exactly what I expected. Covered in dark brown dirt, rocks, and boulders - the ranger explained that at the mountain base that ""feeds"" the glacier, it is covered with loose dirt and rocks. They become frozen in the glacier and as it moves, so does everything frozen inside of it. Makes sense.And right next to GPG, was Marjorie. This was the most active glacier. It was an icy blue color i hadn't ever seen in nature before. at 30 stories tall, the chucks of ice that calved from it (broke off and fell into the water) seemed small, but were probably the size of small cars. When calving occurred, a thunder like roll could be heard. It echoed off of the mountains; rumbling. We saw the glacier calve about 5 times in the hour that we were there. On the way back out of the bay, we saw whales surfacing, spouting, and diving. We also saw seals and sea otters swimming around. Up until this day of our cruise (our first cruise) we weren't sure that they money we spent had been worth it or not. But experiencing all of what Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve was and learning the history behind it - made us no longer doubt our decision. This was our honeymoon and the memories we have from this day and this place will always be with us and will keep us going back as often as we can.Like i said, the way i explain it and my pictures do not do this place justice.

Once you've been there you'll always remember it.We were there in mid-September on a cruise ship. On a cruise ship this is an awesome visit. A couple of the tidewater glaciers are easy enough to get to so that these monster cruise ships can sail right up to them (well, within reason). The next time I come up here, and there will be a next time, I will fly in to Gustavson Alaska to do a little camping and take a smaller ship that does day cruises of the fiord.By the way, between the ""cruise-ship glaciers"" there's still plenty to see. Whales, seals, otters, sea birds, grizzlies, mountain goats etc. so things will not be dull.If you want to go (other than on a cruise ship), DO YOUR HOMEWORK.

I'm a bit of a pennypincher, but this was one time that the extra money is totally worth the heartache!","September 26, 2011",Worth the money,84,US,5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Ice has an inherent beauty that most of us do not appreciate unless someone sculpts it into a swan then covers it with flowers and boiled shrimp. There are no sculpted swans in Glacier Bay, but the ice cubes are HUGE, and the presentation is heavenly. Our cruise ship was allowed to simply float near some of the larger glaciers for over an hour, allowing us to soak in the beauty of the mountains, the ice and the waters of the bay. While floating near the Margerie Glacier were treated to the calving of a small iceberg. Calving is a strange term when you consider the sound made by a calving glacier is somewhere between a shotgun and a cannon, depending on the size of the berg and the density of the ice. Also, unlike their southern cousins, Glacier Bay icebergs range in size, at least the exposed part, from a lily pad to a dinner table. In addition to the majesty and beauty of our surroundings, the National Park Service provides rangers to answer questions and provide information on the area. It was amusing to hear the ranger who narrated our visit address the spiritual majesty of our surroundings without actually committing himself to any firm comment on the difference or similarity between nature, God, a higher power and the expansion of human consciousness. One final note. You can visit the park without taking a cruise line. There is a ferry from Seattle to the Glacier Bay Lodge, and tours can be arranged there. Of course, taking a tour with family, friends, new acquaintances and the park ranger is probably a little different than taking the tour with 2,300 strangers on a ship that masses 93,000 tons. Still, I doubt the ranger would serve you hot chocolate with Baileys to help keep you warm.","September 19, 2011",The majesty of God's icebox!,95,"Fort Worth, Texas",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"If you are doing an Alaska Cruise, Glacier Bay is a place that just can't be missed. The place is absolutely beautiful, with glaciers galore.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,We cruised Glacier Bay National Park and found amazing views of several of the Alaskan glaciers. The most dramatic was the Margerie glacier with a 500 feet high river of ice. Other beautiful views included the Johns Hopkins Glacier and the Lamplugh Glacier. All were different.A word of caution for the traveler: while we were told it is cool and to dress warmly no one had told us this part of Alaska is a rain forest. It rains frequently so bring rain gear.,"September 12, 2011",Glacier Bay is absolutely breathtaking.,28,ossining,5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"As we sailed into the Park, there was only silence and sunshine. I felt I was in the presence of something very special. I actully cried from the sheer beauty of it. Our cruise ship (Holland America Line) brought a park ranger onto the ship and he gave a truly inspiring review of the history of the park from time to time that added to the pleasure of being there. We saw the immense size of the mountains and glaciers, the unspoiled beauty. If you have a bucket list, this is a must see place. It makes you undertand the need o preserve it forever and that nature's balance is fragile.. The end of June was an ideal times to go.","September 12, 2011",It will take your breath away,5,"Montreal, Canada",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"It's already been said by most reviewers - this boat tour is not to be missed. It was one of the highlights of our 5 days in Gustavus. We saw grizzlies, black bear, black wolf, eagles, sea lions, many varieties of other birds, whales, porpoise, and of course the beautiful glaciers. The day was perfect. Breakfast and lunch was just right for us, but we didn't have unrealistic expectations. This is a sightseeing cruise, not a gourmet meal cruise.If we ever get back to Gustavus (and I hope we do), we will definitely do this boat cruise again. Put it on your ""bucket list""!","July 12, 2011",Already Been Said - Excellent,25,"East Berlin, Pennsylvania",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,Be sure to select a cruise ship that has access to Glacier Bay National Park. There are only two allowed to enter the park each day.

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We visited Glacier Bay on board the Holland America Zuiderdam, and were fortunate to be one of only two ships allowed per day into the area. (We also saw a Princess ship).The peace and quiet and scenery were overwhelming. It is such a magical place, and something you can't experience other than by boat. The water was a beautiful green colour (due to the minerals in the water), and the glaciers were a beautiful blue (although they aren't actually blue ... they reflect, instead of absorb the blue colour).We visisted a few glaciers that were stunning, before we arrived at Margerie Glacier which was jaw-dropping. 250 feet high, and about a mile wide. The captain turned the ship so that one side had a full view for a 1/2 hour, and then turned in the other direction so the other side had a full view for a 1/2 hour.It is completely quiet, execept for the very loud sound of the ice cracking and calving. We saw huge chunks of ice crash into the bay, and create large waves. All around us were floating icebergs (iceberg soup, as the ranger called it). We stood at the railing and snapped photos for an hour. I could easily spend an entire day there just staring at the stunning scenery.If you get a chance, choose a cruise line with an itinerary that goes to Glacier Bay. There is nothing else like it, and it will take your breath away.","June 25, 2011","Magical and mystical, takes your breath away!",730,"Kitchener, Canada",5

Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"I visited Glacier Bay on a Holland America Cruise (Zaandam) from Anchorage to Vancouver, after much research. It was the BEST cruise I've ever taken! (out of 15 cruises to various places) Glacier Bay is an amazing place that simply cannot be described; it's an experience of a lifetime! Holland America provides guides who board the ship and describe all of the wonders and sights as the ship sails down the coast and into the bays. The tour is piped to all of the rooms and public areas so noone misses anything! I spent most of my time outdoors watching the whales, the scenery, the eagles, and it was simply ""awesome""!!! We even got to watch female whales teaching their young ""bubble-net feeding""!!  Not all cruise ships can go into Glacier Bay; the size and numbers of the ships are strictly limited each year. Holland America has the mid-sized ships and has the licenses due to the fact that they are one of the original cruise lines that serve Alaska. I plan to go again with my family next summer.","September 29, 2010",An experience of a Lifetime!,18,"Orlando, Florida",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We visited one of the glaciers on a cruise on Holland America Line, and it simply was amazing. In fact, I would say this is one of my top ten experiences in my travels thus far.Basically, the ship goes down a fjord, and you watch the glacier ""calve"" - literally parts break off. Some of the waves were so big that they rocked our mid-sized cruise ship! You also can hear the glacier moving and cracking. It really was an awe-inspiring experience.","September 18, 2010",Glacier Bay will take your love of nature to new heights,10,"Austin, Texas",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We visited Glacier Bay in late August on MS Volendam (Holland America Line), it entire day in Glacier Bay was wonderful. Captain Peter Bos and his crew plus park rangers for the Glacier Bay area gave passengers wonderful views and information about the area. At the main Glacier the ship was turned on a 360 axis to give everyone on board a chance to view from all areas and angles. Caotain Bos speaks of his love for the area and showed his love for the area. The park rangers were able to point out happenings on the shoreline including bears feeding on a dead whale. Make sure you have some strong binoculars.","September 15, 2010",Glacier Bay,39,United Kingdom,4
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Glacier Bay is a place you would only see by cruiseship. Ours was Holland America and our time spent there was prefaced by warnings to be quiet on deck. The ship's engines were off. It was like entering a Cathedral. We saw eagles, seals and glaciers calving. The beauty and serenity was amazing.","September 5, 2010","Stunning, awesome, breathtaking and fragile.",4,"Toronto, Canada",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"I visited Glacier Bay while on an Alaskan Cruise with my wife. Once you have cleared all of the port towns and the open water, you sail into Glacier Bay, escorted by the rangers in their inflated boats. We were on a smaller cruise ship so we skirted up close to the glaciers and took in the audio/visual show as the glaciers calved sending mini icebergs afloat. The hues of deep blue set against the sheet of white are quite vivid, and despite all the noise from the calving, a sense of peace comes over you as you watch this natural show. I didn’t find Glacier Bay to be as beautiful as College Fjords, but it is a beautiful place. There is a chance that if you take a roundtrip cruise that will not sail to Glacier Bay, but a one way 7 day cruise out of Vancouver almost guarantees you will. This is certainly a site worth seeing.","March 15, 2010","Not as nice as College Fjords, But Extremely Beautiful!",123,"San Diego, California",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"Glacier Bay is one of the most stunningly beautiful places you could ever go. To be completely surrounded on all sides by the giant mountains of Alaska, and breathe the cold fresh air of the glacier, is an invigorating and inspiring experience. I'm a local Alaskan who moved away to Portland, OR. I hadn't been to Glacier Bay since I was 10, but recently experienced it anew with my Boyfriend (of San Francisco), and Father. The experience was no less magical than when I was a child, and perhaps more so with the added understanding of what the rest of the US looks and feels like. I looked out at the shimmering crystal clear waters and saw before me the full moon slowly emerge from behind the mountain peak to rise into the velvety night sky. The mountains turned a deep blue gray, and the stars appeared to illuminate the glaciers radiance. Glacier Bay is heavenly.","January 16, 2010","Freezing waters melted from decades old glaciers, surrounded on all sides by giant snowy white mountains",5,"Portland, OR",5
Glacier Bay National Park & Preserve,"We have been there five times on a Holland America cruiseship starting in 1997. The first time there was lots of ice in the water, many ice floes with seals and birds sleeping on them. The water was deep, the air cold and very clear. The ship served freshly cooked salmon at the top level and we were awed by the beauty. Each subsequent trip, there was less ice, less seals, the air was warmer and eventually, the ship did not serve salmon while we sat just off from the calving glacier. The trip through the channel to get to the end of Glacier Bay is still very beautiful and I still love Glacier Bay. But you can see the effects of climate change if you have been there before. We went in 1997, 1999, 2002, 2004, and 2006. We stopped going because the flight from Florida to Alaska just kept getting worse as the government cracked down on what you could carry onto planes, the people on those 8 hour flights became more rude, there was less space, and we just HATE flying in today's world. If it were not so far away, we would go every year. Personally, I would like to live in Alaska, but we cannot at this time. I still would like to go back someday, this place is quiet and lovely. A state park guide gets on the ship at the mouth of the Bay and gets off when the ship is leaving. They used to be quiet and whisper to the guests what was going on, but lately they went to loud speakers, which disrupts the ambience of the entire area. Only a limited number of ships are allowed in the Bay each day. Holland America is the oldest line that has been going there.","December 18, 2009","Glacier Bay, Alaska",15,"Lutz, Florida",5

The magnitude of the face of the glacier defies my ability to capture it in words. The day that we were there the weather was perfect, it bay silent, and the caving frequent.

The views were breathtaking and awesome (sorry, I know this word is overused but it truly describes the bay). As we left the bay, we saw Orca whales jumping in the water. The day was cold and a bit drizzly which gave the whole a bay a misty quality. We truly felt we had entered into a magical kingdom!If you go, pack a rain slicker and some warm layers so you can stand outside and enjoy the sights.
